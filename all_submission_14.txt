Finnish ski jumping team

$C: Last guy doesn't have time for this shit, he has a jump to nail
$C: The last guy is Janne Ahonen, legendary ski jumper (during snowy days in Finland) and drag racer (during the other 16 days in Finland). 
$C: The first guy had the toughest job, it's funny and you can tell he wants to laugh but still manages to turn his smile upside down 
$C: First guy: struggling to frown

Second guy: struggling to smile

Third guy: struggling to give a fuck 
$C: Exactly how my expression looks when I text ‚Äúlol‚Äù
$C: Every Olympics I try to pick one team outside of the US to root form  I usually wait until the Opening Ceremony to do this, but I think I will make an exception this time.  GO FINLAND!
$C: These are like the stages you go through at a job. 1st guy has been there a year. 2nd guy was just hired. 3rd dude has been there 14 years and is sick of Karen's shit.
$C: Ahonen the legend!
$C: Ah, Maeaettae. Classic Finnish name, right along with Haemaelaenen.
$C: Janne Ahonen has not smiled once in his entire life, Im sure of it. He's been in the sport for what feels like 30 years, and he's always had that exact expression on his face
$C: The finnish Red Forman.

I think he is about to put his sky is somebody's ass
$C: it's 2018 and they still can't write M√Ñ√ÑTT√Ñ and go with AE instead.
$C: How did they get them to stand so close to each other?
$C: The last guy is my spirit animal.
$C: What the Helsinki is this 
$C: that second one is a cutie
$C: The first one is trying hard to contain his laughter
$C: I would like to know more about the second guy. How do I subscribe to Finn facts.

Edit: I don't regret my decision at all because I am REALLY enjoying these Finn facts but like can someone tell me his name so I can marry him? Kiitos yall.
$C: I am the third guy : AMN. 
$C: Bwoah
$C: Didn‚Äôt know that Peter Capaldi came from Finland?
$C: Suomi etusivulle!! 
Hyv√§√§ Suomiiii!
$C: So is Aalto a common finnish surname? Saara Aalto is another famous one
$C: The last guy has the face of an Imperial Admiral in the Star Wars universe 
$C: [deleted]
$C: ski jumping is among my favorite sports to watch!! 
$C: "These dumb kids keep asking me to do dumb shit.  I'll just play along I guess."
$C: Second guy is so cute üòç
$C: ‚ÄúAre we finished? Good, let‚Äôs go jump some skis.‚Äù

Squidward: "I hate all of you."

I once had sex with a girl in Helsinki. I don‚Äôt think she was a local though, at the end she kept on saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not Finnish, I‚Äôm not Finnish.‚Äù  
$C: "Hey guys let's do the face thing"
$C: needs more Bwoah!
$C: Can I get a gif of just that last guy?  I need it for literally every conversation I‚Äôm going to have for the foreseeable future. 
$C: Suomi mainittu, torilla tavataan
$C: My grandfather was adopted and we never knew where he came from or what his heritage was. I took one of those ancestry dna kits this year and apparently I‚Äôm half Finnish. This explains a lot.

$C: Well they're adorable. 
$C: Reserved on the outside, goofballs on the inside.
$C: The Belichick of Ski jumping
$C: The first guy was really trying to hold that laughter in.
$C: My favorite part about this is that the last guy probably has the best sense of humor and planned this. 
$C: DO ALL FINNS HAVE SUCH A GOOD SENSE OF HUMOUR? 

from what I've seen on reddit I think so. 
$C: Is that Macgyver?
$C: r/2healthbars
$C: Anyone got a YouTube link? For some reason The gif only buffers half way on my phone then gives up
$C: Wow, is Janne Ahonen still jumping? He must be almost going on 50 now.
$C: Ah the classic Ahonen, glad this guy never changed.
$C: 1936 winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, a Finnish cross country skier Kalle Jalkanen lost he`s fake teeth, stopped and turned back to pick them up and still won gold metal.

$C: Rule of comedy I learned by watching Futurama with the commentary on: the third guy is always the funniest.
$C: I've crewed for the last guy (In blue, Janne Ahonen) when he's raced in a Top Fuel dragster.

$C: The first one kinda looks like froggy fresh
$C: Lol. Love it!
$C: Damn this is climbing fast
$C: Note to self: go to Finland, then touch the hineies   
$C: 157k and no gold?
$C: The last guy did so well I couldn't even tell the transition between one fave to the other 
$C: Eh 
$C: I wish I was Finnish.
$C: r/finlandconspiracy
$C: Finnish? I didn‚Äôt even see them start. 
$C: it's funny how long number 2's last name looks when you don't have diacritics and you have to spell it out. when you spell it regularly it's just M√§√§tt√§
$C: Leave it to the Fins to invent a sport where you have to jump over a ski. Psssst.

$C: Lol vika ei ees jaksanu saatana
$C: Love this....
$C: Man on the end is my spirit animal. 
$C: Damned swedes!
$C: Last guy looks like Grand Moff Tarkin. 
$C: This is quite possibly my favorite gif of all time.
$C: There are four names, what did the first guy do?
$C: I'ma let ya Finnish, but Beyonc√© was the greatest skier of all time.

$C: two of them are Swedish-Finns, then?
$C: Pfft, finnish? They've hardly started!
$C: And like 7 broads afterwards.
$C: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Finnish this.‚Äù
$C: That last reaction was the most Finnish thing I've seen in a long time. 
$C: Or, and this is the more likely scenario, it's witchcraft.
$C: The last one of one of the all time best ski jumpers.
$C: A jump to fail*.... Janne was good... 15 years ago.
$C: It wasn't a good Finnish
$C: Kinda looks to me like he has a hangnail on his big toe... left foot.
$C: looks like he could cut your heart out with a fork
$C: In fairness he has a Doctor Strange sequel to film
$C: hoenstly between catching Neo and assisting Hobbits on a quest to destroy the One Ring, he's a busy man
$C: hahaha
$C: The last guy looks like Admiral Tarkin‚Äôs skiing cousin

http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Wilhuff_Tarkin
$C: I wonder if he'd be more ecstatic if he had a nail to jump. 
$C: He also looks like Hugh Laurie
$C: "I am here for jumping, why is there delay?"
$C: And a sauna to get to.
$C: ‚ÄúWe are here to compete not to party.‚Äù 
$C: He looks like he has something to do that Kevin Bacon would also be needing to do.
$C: Yet still does the hand wave... Wonderful
$C: Are u kidding? Third guy is hilarious.
$C: He looks an awful lot like Gavin Lee and I can't not think of him as Squidward now. 
$C: When ski is life
$C: Yet still maintains great flare. True showman
$C: He looks like Hugh Laurie in House lol... just looks more like House than House does lol 
$C: I feel like that's the coach.. Does change the rest though.
$C: Are we sure the last guy isn't 1990's Richard Dean Anderson? He may have just nailed a few Goa'old.
$C: 1,000th upvote üòÅ
$C: Damn Janne Ahonen. I remember him when watching Ski Jumping on Eurosport like 10+ years ago. I remember him, Matty Hautemaki, Adam Malysz and some others. Wonder what they're doing
$C: It's weird almost every Finn is either in snow sports or motor sports, or both!

I would love a country that much in motorsports but with a little warmer weather.
$C: His nickname is "The mask". This given to him because combination of having a constant deadpan expression and having pretty distinctive ski-jumping mask.

edit: Here Janne with his ski-jumpking [mask](https://olympiastadion.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/janne-ahonen.jpg) on. And here is Janne with his 'other' [mask](http://diepresse.com/images/uploads/1/f/b/459259/Ahonen20090309152833.jpg)
$C: Somehow I briefly misunderstood "drag racer" and thought it was a variant of "drag queen". That was a very interesting image.
$C: And there is a song about him (in German): 

[Christoph & Lollo - Gar Nichts Zu Lachen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ58w1opxJ0)
$C: So does he race in drag, or just own a team of racers in drag?

EDIT:I feel I may have been too subtle in my joke. I was attempting to imply (Semi-NSFW)[this kind](https://cbsmiami.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/kwp01web.jpg?w=640&h=360&crop=1) of drag racing.
$C: [deleted]
$C: little known fact:  [Janne is well known for his sense of humor.](https://media.giphy.com/media/PHuCKp747jvsA/giphy.gif)  
$C: I read this as ski jumper and drag Queen and was both a little confused but also proud of him for diversifying his skills
$C: For some reason when I read drag racer I picture him doing the 100 meter in high heels. And my brain didn't find anything odd about that. 

Enough internet today.


See you guys in an hour.
$C: He looks like he's seen battle
$C: He has incredible resting bitch face!
$C: Because you know... Anyfin can happen ..
$C: It's good to know they're letting racers run in drag now #progress
$C: Running in heels is so hard.   Mad respect
$C: I thought it said legendary ski jumper and drag artist üòÇ 
$C: This guy was an apprentice serving under the lord of jump Matti Nyk√§nen, the deliverer, the bringer of stuff, the promised one.
He told us that " the living is life "
And then he showed us.

$C: Is he able to serve looks!? 
$C: WTF, Ahonen is STILL active? 
$C: Janne was an amazing jumper. Always dangerous and his style was almost always flawless. Only style jumper I'd rate higher is Funaki. 
$C: >drag racer (during the other 16 days in Finland).   

So that's where Pearl ended up.
$C: drag racer? Oh honey!
$C: He's been ski jumping since before most redditors were born.
$C: I'm an American with Finnish ancestry, Ahonen is my last name and last time I was in Europe I would introduce myself and people would say "are you related to the ski jumper?"

I had no idea I shared a name with a famous ski jumper. :/ And now I've finally seen his face.
$C: >drag racer

10th queen in RuPaul's Drag Race All-Stars 3 confirmed
$C: When I saw drag race I immediately thought about drag queens. Now he will forever be a drag queen in my eyes.
$C: He‚Äôs got such a great face- he‚Äôd be an awesome Bond villain. 
$C: I was really hoping you meant like Rupaul Drag Racing. 
$C: I think it‚Äôs fair to say that Janne Ahonen is my spirit animal then
$C: Wait. Hold the fuck on......

You guys only get 16 days where it doesn't snow!?!?!


$C: A drag racer in Finland is a rallycross driver anywhere else.
$C: And the man who made me giggle silly for two minutes straight
$C: That guy is my spirit animal
$C: I think he‚Äôs my hero, just for the facial expression.
$C: He looks like he strands Russian 'tourists' in the wilderness to die of exposure by destroying their supply lines and hunting their officers through snow storms for a hobby.
$C: He‚Äôs rock guitarist and brain surgeon short of the Buckaroo Banzai.
$C: He may just be legend.
$C: I thought it was Benedict Cumberbatch
$C: The fact that he managed to reach 240 m in Planica while fighting a massive hangover is still amazing to me.
$C: I thought he was that Death Star Captain
$C: Janne Ahonen for season 11. 
$C: Wait, is he the coach, or is he actually competing?
$C: The second most legendary jumper currently active, first is Kasai.
$C: He looks like a veteran of the Winter War.
$C: I would have bet money that was Richard Dean Anderson.
$C: Up until this point I didn't know, ty
$C: He is like Finnish Malcolm Tucker
$C: Drag racer... Knew I had seen him somewhere before 
$C: And i wanted to write that the last one went full Ahonen :D
$C: He didnt finnish his facial change
$C: I can't believe he's still jumping! I'm 25 now and remember watching him as a kid. He was always one of my favorites other than Adam Ma≈Çysz of course. 
$C: It looks like he can see John Cena
$C: He‚Äôs very Swanson esque. Minus the mustache of course 
$C: Not just a racer, he pilots a top fuel car. With that deadpan look, I wonder if adrenaline does anything for him anymore. You'd think 400km/h+ would tickle anyone's jimmies. 
$C: Was about mention him, dude been in this sport since the inception lol
$C: So he drives an F1 while crossdressing?
$C: Doctor strange 
$C: Janne is indeed a legend, so nice to see him jump again, I hope he gets close to his former glory soon. Here in Norway, √Öge Aleksandersen made a song called [Janne Ahonens smil](https://youtu.be/XdnEUg023HI) (Janne Ahonen's Smile).
$C: >The last guy is Janne Ahonen.

No, Janne Ahonen is stuffed in a locker somewhere unconscious.

That‚Äôs Agent 47 in Ahonen‚Äôs uniform.  

He still gets the gold though.
$C: He is finished with this
$C: That guy has a great face. I can‚Äôt make mine look so straight/peeved/deadpan as his. It‚Äôs a great Dad face. 

Does he have kids? Maybe it comes with the territory. 
$C: For some reason my mind went to Ru Paul Drag Race and I thought, "you go ice queen, beat your face then beat the world".
$C: I Googled for 'Finnish RuPaul' only to realize what you really meant by 'drag racer'.
$C: He is my hero for today. I found that quite humorous.
$C: You forgot part-time serial killer 
$C: I know a guy who does drag and one who does racing but I've never met a guy who does both at the same time. 
$C: Awesome, OP. What happened to Antti Aalto I the clip?
$C: Am I crazy or is like every other legendary Finn an 'Ahonen?'
$C: Drag racer like vroom vroom or "Yas queen, slay!"
$C: Not to mention he jumped 240m while being drunk, fell on his ass and refused to go to hospital after that so that they wouldn't find out he was wasted. Legend of the sport. 
$C: the drag racing I know isn‚Äôt a sport
$C: Looks like Doctor Who (Capalti)
$C: I thought it was Sting
$C: I remember visiting Finland for 14 of those 16 days once. I was working for 13 of those days. :/
$C: He's like a mix of Clint Eastwood and Jordan Schlansky
$C: I heard he's the tenth queen in All Stars 3
$C: I confused drag racer with drag queen at first and I think that would hilarious
$C: I thought it was Peter Capaldi lol
$C: > (during the other ~~16~~ 160 days in Finland)  

Closer to truth.
$C: But he‚Äôs not smiling to begin with. He goes from serious face to... something else face.
$C: He‚Äôs cute as fuck tho lmao
$C: Love the last guy. He‚Äôs just miserable.
$C: :)

$C: You can see in his eyes that he's trying desperately to contain the laugh
$C: I just tried - you‚Äôre right. Failed miserably.
$C: There is no struggling with that last guy.
$C: The exact emotions of the 1st 2nd and 3rd place winners of any competition.

$C: Oh he gives a fuck, just not about the little arm waving toddler trick that's going on
$C: Camera guy: "thanks guys. way to finnish it."
$C: You're why I have trust issues.
$C: Oh no, you're destroying the sanctity of the lol!
$C: I feel like lol is the polite k.
$C: I have to type "laughed audibly" because "lol" doesn't mean "laugh out loud" anymore.
$C: I never type lol unless I at least smiled. I don't use it often, so most of the time it's something I actually laughed at
$C: Same. If I actually laugh out loud I'll type "lmao". My expression doesn't change but I'll let out a "hah".
$C: lol

$C: Just dont put any money on it... Sorry finland 
$C: Finland is really bad at ski jumping nowadays, so you might be disappointed
$C: Its easy thought. When not my country, pick neighbours. So always Czechs  Poles, and some Austrians for skiing, easy picks there. Then scandinavians because they have pretty people competing. And then Netherlands for speed skating. 
$C: **Finn Fact:** Finland is one of the only two countries in the world that have earned a medal at every Olympic game since 1908.
$C: Estonia is basically tiny Finland too
$C: It's always Karen 
$C:  I quit my last job in homeland security because of a broad named Karen. Only person I legit hate.

$C: im the 3rd guy and it hasnt been 1 year
$C: I remember watching him jump about 10years ago and asking my grandma if he is never happy because he doesn't show any emotions.

10 years later I have yet to see him crack even the tiniest of smiles.

Anyway, a legendary jumper. May Finland someday be at the top again :/
$C: Anneli Jaeaeteenmaeki.
$C: Convert ae to √§ and it makes more sense:

Maeaettae > M√§√§tt√§, the normal spelling of the name.
$C: This is confusing. Apparently I've been mispronouncing Ae incorrectly. I know the Finnish √§¬†sounds like the a in cat. Does Ae not make an "ay" sound like in way? Or an ee sound for Greek words? Or did the international people who decide these things just figure it didn't matter if people's names are mispronounced? 
$C: It's spelled haemaelaeinen. Your version just sounded stupid
$C: Gotta love the Finnish language. 

√Ñteritsiputeritsipuolilautatsij√§nk√§.


$C: Also Moettoelae.
$C: for some reason i read those first 2 words with that lion king music in the background in my head
$C: [This one](https://youtu.be/JRKT1S5K-jM
) must be CGI
$C: My dad just checked and we didn't know he retired for 10 years and just came back. He won his first gold medal 20 years ago...
$C: **Red:** I am going to shove my foot up your ass so hard, your teeth will bleed!



**Hyde:** Have you actually ever done that? Stick your foot in someone ass?



**Red:** One time. In Korea. I don‚Äôt like to talk about it. 
$C: Don't be silly, Red Forman could not be bothered to move his arm for someone else's amusement.
$C: I should put my hiiht√§√§ in your perse, you typerys.     
*This was google Translate's doing. If I completely botched the language I am surstromming. 
$C: In Finland, everybody's dad is Red Forman.
$C: Especially surprising considering ski jumping is full of names with √§,√•,√∂ in them. I mean even Formula 1 global feed was able to get umlauts couple of decades ago. 
$C: m√§√§tt√§l√§ would be even better. maeaettaelae.
$C: Unicode? Never heard of it...
$C: And if the umlauts are totally not possible, just go with MAATTA instead of ae's, that shit looks ridiculous.
$C: Isn't German pretty much the only language where you can substitute "√§" with "ae"? Just using "a" would be much better.
$C: Why tho? As a Finn I find it fun to see the long rows of vowels. It's a very Finnish thing, somehow...

Also, I think a fair compromise would be that they go with finnish characters the day finns can pronounce foreign names and lay off the rally-english.
$C: It's a struggle. But it's funny how we can sit bare naked, side by side in the sauna but while being outside, we keep the distance. I guess we leave personal space with clothes in the dressing room.
$C: He is Janne Ahonen... That's how every finn is. You should see morning trafic in public transport. Everyone dress in black, don't smile and nobody talks or looks at you.
$C: Last guy needs a beer...
$C: No. He‚Äôs mine. 
$C: Then you might like his personality in general. A reporter once asked him why he never smiles and his answer was *"I came here to jump, not to smile."*
$C: He's Finnished with this nonsense.
$C: That last guy is Agent Smith..  we are doomed.
$C: The last guy is pure blood Finn
$C: Let the meme die
$C: > The last guy is my patronus.

Edit: typo
$C: Are you Finnished? 

Sorry too easy.
$C: Denmark it down. 
$C: Almost all Finnish ski jumpers are from outside Helsinki, so no.
$C: I feel like they‚Äôre all cuties 
$C: Finn. More like Fine. 
$C: Hell yeah
$C: It's Andrew Garfield-onnen
$C: No joke. I'd read his awkward love poems all night long.
$C: Haha for real though.
$C: My thoughts as well. 
$C: Haha yes 
$C: The Finns are so good looking ._.
$C: Finnish guys in general tend to be quite cute tbh.


Source: half-Finn who has dated Finnish guys, 5/5 highly recommend it. The only minus is that the majority has been to army.

$C: >How do I subscribe to Finn facts


You're now subscribed to Finn facts.


Did you know that one of the founding fathers that signed the declaration of independence in behalf if Pennsylvania, John Morton, was Finnish?


Did you also know that Finland invents the weirdest sports, i.e "wife carrying" where the winner gets beer worth the woman's weight?


I will continue to PM these to you, every day, until you feel desperate and like all the joy has been sucked out of your life with all the boring, useless, bland facts. Like a proper Finn would.

$C: Other countries attempted to invade Finnland 6 times in the last century. The key word is "tried."

Thanks for subscribing to FinnFacts!
$C: You can tell an extrovert Finn by noticing that he's staring at your shoes instead of his own.
$C: The second guy is really bad at the switch emotions hand thing though. He smiles after his hand is way past. 
$C: First empire to annex and oppress the Finnish people was Sweden, then Russia punched Sweden and seized Finland, though Finland was granted a lot more autonomy during this period, and then Bolsheviks punched the Russian tsar and let Finland slide. Later they thought that we need this back but they only got a couple of pieces.
Oh and there was a civil war after becoming independent where the right wing loyalist White guards butchered 18 000 workers/Reds after they had surrendered, dividing the people who did unite later during the Winter War, because even the Finn socialists did not want to join the USSR.

Oh wait, you wanted to learn about Finnish sportsmen? Uh...

$C: You‚Äôve been subscribed to Finn facts!! Did you know that until 1876 65% of Finns we‚Äôre born with actual fins instead of tailbones? It was in that year that the Finnish government put into effect the FFRA (Finnish fin removal act) which involves various promotional campaigns urging sperm donation by Finns without fins. The hashtag #finnswithoutfins is still active to this day and today the Finnish government boasts a Finns with fins rate of less than 50%. Standard data and text rates apply.

$C: Eetu Nousianen!
$C: First one ain‚Äôt too bad either
$C: "Are we Finnish?"
$C: Oon jo t√§√§l jne.
$C: also hate standing next to a stranger without at least 2 meter of space between you? 
$C: you alphabetize the food in your refrigerator, don't you?
$C: It's due to a magical fluid they drink.  That rhymes with palcohol.
$C: Yes but we don't show it. We laugh when no one's looking.

$C: He retired twice already yet he's still Finland's leader...
$C: He's 40.
$C: speak for yourself
$C: He doesn't look like a big talker.
And like he could and would kill a big talker when stuck in an elevator.
I'd love to be stuck there with him for a couple of days of silence.
$C: does anyone know how to pronounce that? I bet he pronounces it differently all the time just to troll people.  
  
edit:   plot twist: it‚Äôs apparently the seventh most common name in Finland
$C: Happy cake day!!!
$C: Let me fix that for you.    3. I have already killed you 3 times in my head before you said hello. 
$C: Twelfth Doctor was my first thought. Gregory House too.

$C: Large hill is HS between 110m and 184m, you're talking about ski flying hills (HS > 185m) probably
$C: You've never heard of ski jumping? [Oh man](https://youtu.be/x9IuBMEcluc?t=38s)
$C: Not yet, couple of weeks to go.
$C: I bet you felt REALLY good about that, didn‚Äôt ya?
$C: February 9th
$C: I've got the last name and everything. 
$C: Number 1
$C: Make That 202
$C: 
There he is. There he goes again. Look, everyone! He posted it once again! Isn't he just the funniest guy around?! Oh my God.


$C: wow so original
$C: Often the two find they have much in common. 
$C: They are but the people from that side of the "spectrum" are rightfully downvoted to oblivion.
$C: mutta se ei ole hauska vitsi saatana
$C: I can‚Äôt imagine living a life as pathetic and empty as someone who responds to something funny like this with paranoid delusions of cultural destruction 
$C: Olympics? That was mythical just few centuries ago.

$C: Incoming Finnish and Scandinavian who'll tell you Finland is not part of Scandinavia.
$C: Finland is part of Fennoscandia, not Scandinavia.

And also a part of the Nordic Countried I guess.
$C: Finland isn't Scandinavia motherfuckeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!
$C: Boards               ......*wait*
$C: Some people do a semester abroad.  This guy does a broad a semester, and his semesters are very short.
$C: Skiing is all about vertical jumps and horizontal women
$C: I spent all my money on booze, broads and bikes.

The rest I wasted
$C: This guy fucks
$C: At least 
$C: Little bit of powder on the bunny slopes *eh eh* 

(Talking about coke and tits) 
$C: Them snow bunnies. Hippity hoppity hump
$C: in Atlanta?
$C: 7? They are rookie numbers. 
$C: How do you jump broad?
$C: People still use broads?  Is that like looking for dames?
$C: May you sink in hell for that.
$C: Literally every meeting we have someone has a joke about me being Finished. Meh....
$C: I hope they actually say that before competing. 
$C: Pls delete dis
$C: I was so in love with that man. Just...damn. good looking dude. 
$C: Ma≈Çysz after retiring became a rally driver for a while and completed Dakar. Now he's a coordinator in the Polish Ski Association. And Hautam√§ki I believe is driving trains.
$C: And Sven Hannawald, and Martin Schmitt (totally no regional bias) and this japanese guy (who is still jumping as a idk, 90 yr old?)
$C: Noriaki Kasai is still jumping!
$C: Holy fuck what a blast to the past haven't heard these names in ages used to love watching ski jumping as a kid
$C: *Matti Hautam√§ki, or Hautamaeki as it was written on the graphics.
$C: Kazuyoshi Funaki!
$C: Yeah, I remember when he was just a kid.... 20 years ago.... damn!
$C: What about Simon Amman? Switzerland's greatest pride for a few weeks every four years. 
$C: Matti Hautam√§ki retired a few years ago
$C: I'm old..I remember Matti Nykanen
$C: Me too! I remember hating him because he kept  winning over base jumper I was fan of lol.
$C: Ahone is still jumping, but isn't doing well which I guess is why you haven't seen him. Hautam√§ki actually works as a train operator.
$C: Kasai was winning when I was one year old. He's still jumping. I'm 26 now.
$C: Oh man I feel the sport got really intense last few years again. Kamil stoch equaled the ridiculous 4 hill grand slam, only sven hannavald did that before. Finns are actually very weak currently.
$C: Adam is still with ski Jumping. He is helping polish ski jumpers and he Appears on every contest. He works in polish ski jumping assosiation. 
$C: >every Finn is either in snow sports or motor sports, or both!

Or in sauna. 
$C: In Finland we complain if it's over 20C outside, or under 100C in a sauna. We also complain whenever there's weather outside. Any kind of weather.


$C: It's adversity such as poor weather and curvy roads that make good drivers.  Need proof?  Ride with a Texan who's trying to drive somewhere other than Texas.
$C: They also won the IPSC Rifle Championship last year. 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place. 
$C: Or the rookie 3-point king in the NBA
$C: Or a hockey player.
$C: It's because their standards for getting a driver's license are so much higher because of the increased risk of driving in ice and snow.

As a result? The Finns are magnificent drivers.
$C: I think you just convinced me to move to Finland üòÇ
$C: They tried beach volleyball, no takers.
$C: They live for the Finnish line.
$C: Australia is your friend
$C: Pretty much. I know a goofball from Finland that is a mechanic. He probably would have pulled his dick out for this though. 
$C: I think Finns are required to do rally cross style driving in order to acquire a drivers license.

Source: Hammond on Top Gear where he did the Scandinavian Flick in a van.
$C: The Finnish accent for spoken English is literally known as "Rally English" from the popularity of their rally car racers internationally, no joke
$C: in the world of rally cross there is a saying that "[if you want to win, hire a Finn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bmqdnx5R1U)"
$C: Top gear (James May) did a segment on why finland produces some of the best drivers in the world.  
$C: Spain is very much into motorbikes. Somewhat into F1 too, thanks to Fernando Alonso
$C: We call them Talvisaatana and Moottoriperkele
$C: I ran into a Finn at the Helsinki airport on my way back to Toronto (we were both drinking at 6am).  He was pissed drunk in a sauna at 2am and his boss called him to go to Portugal to help with a race.    He figured he may as well keep drinking so he didn't get hungover.

Cool guy.
$C: there's an old saying in rally racing:

>If you want to win, hire a Finn. 
$C: Or shooting rifles.  
On a tangent, I kinda wish the Nordic Combined event could be ski jump and biathlon, instead of the jump and just a regular ol' cross-country ski race.
$C: Or an NHL goaltender.
$C: Then there‚Äôs Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen who does everything 
$C: Finland has pretty much pioneered and/or championed every sport that requires you to undo your brain, not question why the sport is at is it, if it even is a sport, or just russian roulette in disguise, and then just fucking do it.
$C: Why Finns are so good at racing: "Wait, so this track isn't covered in snow, either? Sweet."
$C: Motorsport is no fun if there's traction.
$C: what a strange thing.  I had never even really thought about what a strange thing this is.  What a strange thing.  I've never even thought of a stranger thing.
$C: Like italy!~
$C: When it comes to racing those Finn's are fucking crazy also the Aussies as well and if I remember correctly the Swiss have the biggest street racing night in the world
$C: Southern U.S?
$C: Or on reddit
$C: Weather? That's what saunas are for
$C: Maybe its because you need all the adrenaline you can get with all that lack of sunlight (until the endless summer, anyway).
$C: It‚Äôs because their roads are so dangerous that every citizen goes through extensive on track drivers ed. Top gear has an episode about it. I‚Äôm pretty sure being able to hold a power slide on the skid pad is necessary to get your license. 
$C: Whoa, let‚Äôs not forget about up and coming NBA superstar Lauri ‚ÄúThe Finnisher‚Äù Markkanen 
$C: Northern California or reno area can both provide that. And you can also option into surfing. One of my brothers does cars, the other snow boarding. And moto x is huge around here.
$C: Murica 
$C: Snowmobiles. Two-in-one üòÑ
$C: Indiana?
$C: Bwoah
$C: > It's weird almost every Finn is either in snow sports 

Isn't Finland covered in snow a lot of the time?
$C: You mean [America?](https://twt-media.washtimes.com/media/image/2015/04/12/4_122015_nascar8201.jpg)
$C: Have you heard of a place called Florida?
$C: I heard that in Finland it takes three years to complete your driving licence and it includes rally driving training 
$C: Tfw you describe Michigan
$C: Try Sweden then!
$C: I feel like they don't get much of a choice when it comes to sports without snow
$C: Snowtor sports
$C: kinda like every Vietnamese can rip apart an apple in half.
$C: I think I need to visit Finland....
$C: ITS FINLAND!
$C: I learned first in anthropology and then again later in evolutionary biology that super whities have a slight possibility of advantage in snow sports. It‚Äôs suggested that their muscular endurance maintains at lower temps better, probably just because of evolutionary genetic response for the fittest to better survive the and operate in the cold. Same idea as Africans and black ethnicities having more recently spread away from Africa possibly as a group being better at sprint run, especially at high temperatures. Not sure about this aspect exactly, and my phone is on 7% so I can‚Äôt fact-check myself right now but there was some sort of difference in long-twitch and short-twitch muscles I remember my (possibly biased) professor describing. We also learned of the suggestion that Asians have the same number of muscles obviously, long and slow twitch, but more *condensed*. Which would probably work out well for gymnastics. 

Also important to remember that dark skin = melanin for folate protection, where sunlight (thus D3) is plentiful. Light skin = less melanin for increased vitamin D3 absorption/production where the sun intensity is not as dangerous. Tanning = the ability to gain and lose melanin for higher variability of sunlight per season. Race all basically (don‚Äôt shred me, Reddit) depends on the accessibility sunlight of our ancestors! I find this to be a cool distinction.
$C: Well, they're from Finland
$C: That's how they keep a high body temperature. Adrenalin 365/24/7...
$C: Or trying to be the strongest man 
$C: You might be interested in learning a new figure: there are, in total, 2018 newborns included, 637 Finnish people.
$C: Italy loves it's motors!
$C: Finn here. Hockey player. All my friends jumped 
$C: Australia, mate.
Also some Arab countries too.
$C: it's not really the "country" per se but the american south is quite a bit bigger than finland (at least population wise) and many of them are obsessed with nascar.
$C: Or a melodic metal band.
$C: Well thts how they fought the soviet-finnish war
$C: Well seeing as Finland isn't real, they can make up whatever backstory they want about these alleged Fins
$C: Actually he's not really that serious person IRL. Just last week I spotted [this poster of him](https://i.imgur.com/mN1RQ3X.jpg) on the window of [a sewing machine shop](https://i.imgur.com/Lf7QDaX.jpg). Just look at that [natural, not at all forced smile.](https://i.imgur.com/zP8BIZR.jpg)
$C: The mask actually makes him look like a badass bird, hawk or something.
$C: That mask is amazing wow
$C: I miss the masks in ski jumping
$C: Here's another ski mask picture: https://i.imgur.com/DtuO9uZ.png
$C: So the Kimi Raikkonen of Ski Jumping?
$C: That mask is so badass.
$C: He looks like a Kamen Rider
$C: So is the Stig his brother or something?
$C: mask on, fuck it, mask off
$C: I always like [this](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/016/212/manning.png) one better.
$C: Rupaul has that kind of drag race, so your confusion is warranted 
$C: RuPaul's impact
$C: I did the exact same thing!

yeah, release date 1999 ... man ...
$C: I was wondering what season had he been on, until I remembered that there were some car results when I was trying to google about men in wigs.
$C: Both actually. At least he has had other drivers but The main thing has been his own driving.
$C: LIP SYNC FOR YOUR LYYYYYYFEEEE!
$C: [he‚Äôs the 10th queen](/spoiler)
$C: Ahhhh.... a biker....  I'm an idiot....

$C: That is the most jpg-y gif I've seen in quite a while
$C: Almost as good as my wife's
$C: yeah and he's somehow still the best Finnish jumper
$C: Haha, no that would be ridiculous. It's closer to 12. 
$C: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland#Climate  serious answer here! Tall country so south and north have quite different climates.
$C: Would be more accurate the southern Finland gets 16 days of snow every year. 
$C: Nah that's Finnish smiling in the beginning, though mistaking it for a neutral face is completely natural.
$C: ( ò‚åí ò‚à•) 

$C: [deleted]
$C: I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who thought so üòÇ
$C: He was a strong Finnish. 
$C: The irony is that the last guy is probably Finland's all time best ski jumper.
$C: I hate when people hack in skiing comptetions. Participants should have to wear body cams so we can ensure nothing fishy is going on
$C: They say that Bronze medalists are usually happier than Silver medalists.  At least in the olympics.
$C: God damn hackers... how will people respect the game if there's a hacker in every server taking PEDs so good that our anti-cheat can't detect them?!
$C: See no evil, hear no evil, give no fucks. 
$C: Fucks: what are they even?
$C: Fucks: -273.15¬∞C

$C: lol
$C: Lmao
$C: Trust issues?  Wow you kind of just opened my world a little.  I‚Äôm to busy with my respect issues when I see ‚Äúlol‚Äù to give a fuck about applying trust to the person.
$C: rofl. no really. i'm rolling on the floor laughing. i don't even know how i'm steady enough to even type this.
$C: Lmao
$C: [deleted]
$C: Is "k" impolite?

I do get frustrated when I type out a really long message to someone and they just say "k" back... I mean, am I not worth an "o"? But I don't consider "k" to be impolite in and of itself...
$C: https://i.imgur.com/yUY2pv6.png
$C: lirl - laughing in real life. "It may sound stupid and nobody will know what you're talking about... lirl."
$C: From Finland, can confirm, don't put any money on us.. We love tragedies.
$C: Yeah. Last guy, Janne Ahonen used to be one of the best jumpers in 2000-2007, then he retired twice and nowadays ski jumping is basically just his hobby, and yet he's still top 3 finnish jumper. 
$C: I don't feel like teams losing really affects my level of enjoyment. But then again I basically just watch ice skating. 
$C: Screw the Netherlands. They do one sport really well that literally nobody outside of the Netherlands does, yet somehow this one sport gives 50% of all medals.
$C: Did she tell you about her cats?
$C: It's Finland. Her name would be Karenen.
$C: fuck karen!
$C: 10 years ago it was Tracey.

10 years from now it'll probably be Katelin. 
$C: Even when it's a Finnish man.
$C: Or a Brenda.
$C: She's a female Kevin, that one.
$C: Every group has a Karen... 
$C: Don‚Äôt forget Sharon. 
$C: In my experience, it's always Linda.

*Always.*
$C: Why are Karens like this?
$C: Fucking karen
$C: Anneli Iced tea hill?
$C: Pretty sure she is jaetteenmaeki coz jaeaeteenmaeki (j√§√§teenm√§ki) would translate as icetea's hill
$C: You forgot a t
$C: Is "ae" considered an acceptable substitute for "√§" in Finnish? I thought that rule only applied to German, and maybe Swedish proper names.
$C: In Finnish, ae is very much a and e. Or like ah-eh. The letters and their pronounciation doen't change from being close to each other.

Replacing √§ with ae is a German thing, as German allows for the umlaut to be replaced with an e. M√ºller vs Mueller. In Finnish, there are no umlauts and √§,√∂ and √• are all their own letters of the 29-letter alphabet.
$C: Ae (or √§) should be pronounced like the a in cat in Finnish names.
$C: Though that's gibberish in Finnish.

Ep√§j√§rjestelm√§llistytt√§m√§tt√∂myydell√§√§ns√§√§nk√∂h√§n is a grammatically correct non-compound word though.
$C: saippuakullipyllypillukauppias

1. Which korea we talking about?
2. I need name of the massage parlour you went to (for research of course)
3. Does the broth.. I mean massage parlour accept credit card?
$C: **Hyde:** Oh. I raped at least six women by the way
$C: Not that badly, but "hiiht√§√§" is the act of cross country skiing and "suksi" would be the equipment you use.
$C: Surstr**√∂**mming, f√∂r fan.

$C: They're just naked waist down
$C: >But it's funny how we can sit bare naked, side by side in the sauna but while being outside, we keep the distance


No but seriously, memes aside, strangers do talk to each other in here. I.e asking strangers out is very common, so is asking/proposing help and so on.


I just felt that that meme is around so much many people can take it seriously.
$C: So its finnish clothes that need personal space?
$C: So are you saying Finns are a more introverted, keep to yourself culture? (except in saunas)
$C: That sounds glorious
$C: When in public, the average Finn looks at their shoes. The outgoing and gregarious Finn looks at other people's shoes.

$C: Except the early morning drunks and the occasional bohemian eccentric.
$C: My kind of heaven
$C: I might be able to fit in in Finland...

$C: Wow those quirky fins who don't talk to each other on public transport haha so wacky!!!1!

**Finn Fact:** Finland has been ranked to have world‚Äôs most free press 12 times since 2002 by Reporters Without Borders.

$C: Well i just mean in general, like he could easily play an Imperial officer character in the franchise. 
$C: There should be more. Everyone should love it!! I don‚Äôt understand!
$C: Voidaako menn√§ vasta ylihuomena ku on niin saatanan kylm√§..? 
$C: This is wonderful. I really liked watching the other countries intros too.
$C: Wow, that makes me feel old. In my mind I‚Äôve been seeing him jump for 20-odd years. so I thought he must be really old now. Turns out he‚Äôs only a year older than me.

Is Kasai still jumping? That guy must really be approaching 50.
$C: He actually does speak for himself.
$C: Well, I figured out something interesting about that. It's actually spelled M√§√§tt√§. Maybe ae is just the way they write √§ when they don't have that character available to them? The thing that really threw me off is that I lived in Finland for a couple years, and that didn't look like a Finnish last name to me before I saw it spelled with dotted A's.

The dotted A's are like the a in apple. The m sounds like an English m, and the t's are fairly similar to English t's (they say them a bit differently in Finnish, but I would say the English t is the closest English sound to the Finnish t).

Double vowels are held out a bit longer (it's kind of subtle), and the double t is kind of like you block the air coming out of your mouth the way you usually do for a t, but instead of immediately releasing it, you hold it for a split second and then let the air out.
$C: Thanks.
$C: Yes! :)
$C: Puns are funny.
$C: Ahh a countdown top right! Thanks
$C: This isn't a joke... If you honestly still believe Finland exists you are one dense fucker.
$C: such funny, how haha.

$C: I can and do - focus on the details of life if you want. people like me look at the bigger picture and the problems of the generation that is not my own but that of my children

$C: Thats a nice way to end your careers, well depending on what kind of train of course but it would be nice to just come home from driving trains instead of training and etc
$C: >And Hautam√§ki I believe is driving trains.

Out of personal interest or do ski jumpers not earn enough during their careers to finance the rest of their lives? 
$C: Cool ≈Ç 
$C: > And Hautam√§ki I believe is driving trains.

is this a good idea?
$C: Noriaki Kasai? He's 45, you just had to divide the age by 2. Close enough
$C: Sven Hannawald in the winter and Michael Schumacher and Valentino Rossi in the summer. My childhood heroes!
$C: Hannawald got into GT racing aswell for a few years, even somewhat successful.
$C: Thomas Morgenstern. But yeah, none of them hold a candle to Ahonen in his prime.
$C:  What about Hideharu Miyahira? I allways loved his name!

$C: Are you guys just making up all these names?
$C: He's going to his 8th consecutive Olympics soon which is kinda insane!
$C: Jumped in the world cup in four different decades starting out in 89. The 80's, 90's, 00's, and 10's. Really hope he keeps going into the 20's for five different decades of top level ski jumping!
$C: Me too, but back in my day it was Horst Bulau 
$C: Me too. The world was nice back then. 
$C: Yes I remember Simon Amman! 
$C: Nowhere near his old form. Lands a decent jump or two every so often.

$C: Oh my god- I once ended up in a sauna with a Finnish guy in a hotel and he tried to kill me, I swear. Def a macho problem. (I have asthma so that didn't help, but it felt like my eyes were melting.) 
$C: [Or whatever this is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHReqKRvonE)
$C: Is Finland the country where you need to basically need to pass a professional drivers test to even gain a license?
$C: I wondered why my town in Canada had so many sauna's, apparently has one of the biggest Finnish populations in the country
$C: Or hacking childrens games
$C: Or trying to win Sitting-on-an-Ant-nest competition.

https://www.tripsavvy.com/weird-events-in-finland-1625919

(Sauna competitions are not held anymore because one contestant died during a competition)
$C: Or rebel scum 
$C: Or under the ice
$C: Need a car that is effectively a sauna on wheels. Wait, with self-driving cars that might actually be doable...
$C: But they dont exist 11!1!!1!!!!!
$C: hahaa
$C: Confirmed. Been to Finland. They love to sauna with those special branches. 
$C: Still not hot
$C: That‚Äôs a sport, too
$C: Just back from my semester abroad in Helsinki, I agree with this a great lot.
$C: That's partial watersports
$C: Yoo-hoo! 
$C: My Russian ex calls Finland a shithole country she visits to get her passport stamped lol.
$C: Username checks out.

Also, weather is the greatest conversation topic. You can always say something about it without having to open up to your colleague about your life. That's being Finnish.
$C: i would like to subscribe to random finnish facts
$C: Pretty much the same in northern Sweden, which is mostly populated by Finnish descendants anyway.
$C: Fuck weather.

Had to walk from work today in -14¬∞C. I fucking hate when it's this warm outside.
$C: Are you sure that you aren't Canadian?  All we do is complain about the weather.  It's our second most popular pastime after hockey.
$C: > Any kind of weather

Yep I could see that.
$C: !Subscribe 
$C: I would think with the amount of saunas per capita, Finns would be able to withstand high heat comfortably. 
$C: You mean Finnish people only complain about the weather? Common. You and I both know that Finnish people complain about *everything* 
$C: Generally we're just really happy when we see an extreme change in weather because MAN will that make a killer story while packing up your groceries at the store
$C: !subscribe
$C: In Canada, I hate weather hotter than 20c, but snow is cool, but I wish it only lasted for 4 months instead of 6, and rain is cool.

Spring and Fall are the best seasons, and winter is cool too, it's just too long.

Summer is garbage though.

Ideal temperature is 10c to 20c.
$C: Generally we're just really happy when we see an extreme change in weather because MAN will that make a killer story while packing up your groceries at the store
$C: Generally we're just really happy when we see an extreme change in weather because MAN will that make a killer story while packing up your groceries at the store

$C: Grew up in Western PA. I‚Äôm a pretty good driver in adverse conditions. Anytime I see a Virginia or either Carolina plate...I make a lot of distance.
$C: Rick Allen?
$C: Mmmm... curvy.
$C: Just a heads up to Russia not to get any funny ideas
$C: Disappointed how far down I had to scroll to see Markkanen referenced. 
$C: Lauri Legend, The Markksman, The Finnisher!
$C: You mean Hanno Mottola?
$C: Snow sport
$C: Lots of incredible hockey players come from Finland. Go stars!
$C: Funny enough driving here makes me think all that is bogus.

What really translates to solid rally drivers is the backroads thruout the country. The kids already interested in cars and driving can find some backroad that they can thrash on, right up until some neighbor calls the cops.
$C: Someone's seen Top Gear ;) 
$C: It's because their typical daily commute goes something like this: https://youtu.be/nrAwEwGUY5E
$C: I work for a Finnish company. When my boss visits, he is always concerned if I don't come to a complete stop at stop signs. We're talking stop signs in the middle of nowhere with no other cars in sight. 
$C: > It's because their standards for getting a driver's license are so much higher because of the increased risk of driving in ice and snow.

I wish Canada had those standards.
$C: Or are they just rich? ü§î 
$C: I‚Äôm going apeshit in LA since the drivers here seem to be infants. The car crashes I see daily are insane. And people here don't seem to understand what a blinker is and how to use one.
$C: And yet in Canada, the standards for getting a driver's license is that you need a pulse.  Actually, even that's probably not a strict requirement.

And as a result, most Canadians are shit drivers, and even a few centimeters of snow causes hours of delays.
$C: Finns are magnificent drivers?

Have you ever been to a Finnish City? Turku, Helsinki, etc?
$C: I don't think they're accepting immigrants from shithole countries like the US. 
$C: Don't get raped
$C: It's kinda hard to play Beach Volleyball in Finland when there are Polar Bears hanging out on the beach.
$C: There were actually 2 sisters who won bronze in the European championships in 2010, and played pro for a few years (there have also been at least one other women's pair who've played pro, apparently). There's a few indoor courts, in addition to playing outdoors in the summer.
$C: Get out
$C: Yea, but the internet...
$C: As an Australian with Finnish parents, can confirm.
$C: So is that big ass spider trying to eat you
$C: Australia is no ones friend.
$C: Yes, Finns actually do have to drive on track to get a license. And usually instructors push you up to speeds where you can't control the car anymore.
$C: [Are you referring to his rally lesson with Mika Hakkinen?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bmqdnx5R1U)
$C: The thing is that there are some Finns who don't show much emotion in public. On other hand when it private and with friends they show much more emotion.
$C: I loved every single one of those links. Thank you. 
$C: Birdhawks are *everywhere* in Finland, so that's perfect!
$C: [Here's another one of his masks.](https://m.imgur.com/a/6Vzmd)
$C: I saw that coming but I still laughed
$C: That's actually far cooler than I expected, weird you don't see it in other sports.
$C: That pic loaded slowly enough for me to just see the hairline, which apparently is all I need to see in order to recognize it nowadays. 
$C: http://i.imgur.com/o536nVm.gifv

*click
$C: I knew what it was and I still fell for it. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/tJePtVx.png) is an actual picture for those who were interested like I was. 
$C: FACK
$C: DAMN YOU
$C: Ohhh you got me good, good enough to make me angry 
$C: Lol this will never die
$C: Is that legal for Olympic competition?
$C: You fucking bastard
$C: Can you /r/OutOfTheLoop it for me?
$C: Dude. Wtf. NSFW that shit.
$C: That‚Äôs my favorite thing on Twitter: guys who don‚Äôt know that RPDR is a drag competition 
$C: OOoooOOOhHHH HhhoooNNnaaay!
$C: As a kid (okay and sometimes now) I get so confused when drag race/drag show is brought up, as well as base jumping and freebasing. 
$C: i spent literally minutes finding this gif in a better quality.  
$C: The ones you've seen lately aren't actual gifs but just muted videos (gifv, webm, mp4 etc). And those compression artifacts don't have any sort of jpgy edge weirdness, just giffy jaggedness. It's the most normal mundane gif.
$C: And sometimes it sleets. Makes for a nice change. 
$C: > so south and north have quite different climates.

Posts picture showing 95% of the country with the same K√∂ppen climate classification. 
$C: Ah, such a beautiful people, and so expressive 
$C: I mean it looks like he's smiling more when he's "frowning" lol
$C: *smiles in Finnish*
$C: I assume mistaking it for a natural face is completely neutral as well.
$C: Is the last one a Finnish smile?

$C: TIL: I‚Äôm Finnish 
$C: Homo 
$C: Obviously gril
$C: Username checks out.
$C: Cause he eats his spinnish
$C: You forgot Matti Nyk√§nen, it's not even a contest. 4 Olympic golds, 1 silver, 6 world championship golds, 2 silvers and six bronzes etc.

And pretty much all that while constantly drunk...
$C: Actually Matti Nyk√§nen is, and he's widely regarded as the best jumper of all time.
$C: Certainly with hockey matches.  Winning the Bronze means you won your last game.  Winning Silver is opposite.
$C: ~~Error 404 Fucks not found~~

$C: I made a couple dollars betting on fins in the dota 2 Championship last year, if that helps.
$C: And pants. 
$C: How is Janne Ahonen still active.  It feels like ideas watching him jump more than 20 years ago
$C: Don‚Äôt that just mean he‚Äôs so good that other good skier is not as good as he? 
$C: And curling
$C: >The Dutch team won 24 medals of which 23 were in (long track) speed skating and one in short track speed skating.

You weren't joking.
$C: Thats why. Its kinda wierd they get so many of them. And also funny. 
$C: No, but she doesn't stop going on about her pit bulls. 
$C: Cats!? She can't stop talking about *anything*. I don't know how she gets anything done around here, but she always has her shit in on time. Totally smug about it too... 

KAREN: *Pfft, I don't know why you guys are always stress'n, my TPS report was in two days ago! Hey, I saw on Facebook that Gary's woman left him two days ago! Can you believe that! I guess he's gonna stress eat now and put on another 20 pounds. Oh, and Susan could stand to lose a couple herself, those sun dresses she wears, so not work place attire by the way... Those dresses are getting a little tight on her these days.*

ME: *begins sawing wrist with lunch room butter knife*
$C: LOL we have a Karen that always talks about her cats. I can't stop laughing.
$C: I have never heard more truer words
$C: Kk√§rr√©nn
$C: >Her name would be Karenen.


Ritva or Tuija would be more accurate.
$C: Spelled Caitlynn
$C: Ann lived Iced tea's hill
$C: Anneli Waste's hill. 
$C: That would be j√§√§tee, her name was J√§√§tteenm√§ki (note two t's). Waste is j√§te -> j√§tteen, so not that either, I don't know what her name's etymology is.


$C: Missed a t. It's Jaeaetteenmaeki.
$C: It's only meant for the noob people abroad who don't know what "√§" is.
$C: If I remember correctly, the ministry of foreign affairs recommends substituting "√§" with "ae" instead of "a" in foreign documents. That way a British passport official can distinguish between mr. H√§k√§nen and mr. Hakanen.
$C: No, that's very much a German thing.

Finns prefer *a* and *o* if *√§* and *√∂* are not available. As every letter in Finnish is pronounced, it's better to have one letter slightly wrong than to have it, and an extra letter that has to be pronounced as well.
$C: No, not really. I blame the US ASCII encoding for this.
$C: TIL, thank you very much! 
$C: It's grammatically correct, but nobody would use that word (in that form). You can say the same thing by wording your sentence differently.



It's the same thing as with this english sentence:

[Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo)

It is grammatically correct, but nobody would use that in a normal discussion.
$C: [It's not gibberish.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%84teritsiputeritsipuolilautatsij%C3%A4nk%C3%A4)
$C: Hey. Hyde was a better man than Masterson.
$C: Oh Hyde you're so wacky, get back to the FotoHut

$C: Aku Ankka-style
$C: > memes aside

I love this century.
$C: we have all seen the pics of Finns waiting at the bus stop
$C: I know too this isn't really the case. The first impression of us Finns just is a bit of cold "do not approach me or else". 
$C: Absolutely. Dare to hang your clothes too close to mine and I'll move further away. But you can sit next to me in the sauna, if it's already crowded.
$C: I can't speak on behalf of every Finn but for me this applies. I can be quite hard to get a longer response out of, and definitely I'm not a small-talk person but more straight to the point.
$C: You know it's funny how we have company parties where ppl drink heavy, you make new best friends, fight, next Monday everything is back to normal and nobody talks to you.
$C: So a perfect world does exit. 
$C: Seriously. Sign me the fuck up. 
$C: Finnish death metal plays thru the com system. 
$C: Found the INTJ.
$C: 666 upvotes. Satan confirmed
$C: I've heard a similar joke about engineers. 
$C: Yes but like fat Thursdays relatives.
$C: "What for can you I make do?"
$C: >"Please maintain an air of silent misanthropy on the train"

Words to live by.
$C: >All ~~fins~~ people do

There. Much better.

$C: koska jos k√§yt armeijan se tarkoittaa ett√§ hyv√§ksyt ja tuet ep√§inhimillist√§ ep√§tasa-arvoista riistopolitiikkaa. 
$C: Yeah you can see the names at the beginning 
$C: Translating Finnish to English is nuanced and complicated, keyword almost.
$C: He does not know what emotions are
$C: nauran
$C: The 188k value is for lakes larger than 500 m¬≤. I don't know what the minimum size was in Norway's count.

The highest lake densities in parts of Lapland are over 1000 lakes per 100 km¬≤, meanwhile our largest lake is 4400 km¬≤, so you can see how just a density or number count count can be misleading, as the latter technically leads to only one lake over more than 1000 km¬≤, i.e. over 10 000 times fewer lakes per area, if I got my quick math right. Or 1000 fewer lakes, because there's just one big one.
$C: I think he was intentionally bullshitting.
$C: saatana mik√§ ty√∂maa. Kaiken maailman turhanp√§iv√§st√§ juhlimista ja haihattelua.
$C: Top mod of /r/skijumping are inactive but one of the mods agreed to post a subreddit request, I'm planning to revive that shit before Olympics hit
$C: No et voi. T√§√§ on just t√§t√§ et aina pit√§√§ vaan olla kivaa ja kun v√§h√§n joutuu ep√§mukavuusalueelta poistumaan niin murrutaan kun pipari. Meid√§nki isovanhemmat hiihti yhdell√§ suksella alasti yl√§makeen kouluun joka p√§iv√§ kes√§t talvet ja s√§ et voi ees torilla k√§yd√§ suorittamassa kansalaisvelvollisuuttas. Nyt l√§het heti etk√§ mussuta.
$C: Sinne torille menn√§√§n vikisem√§tt√§
$C: Kasai is 45 at the moment, he won silver in Sochi 4 years ago and is also in the team for the upcoming Olympic Games. Also, his home town of Sapporo is bidding for 2026 Winter Olympics, and if they win, he's said he still wants to jump there.
$C: Speak for him 
$C: Here we see the failures of the American educational system
$C: I guess people from that side of the "spectrum" don't have anything else going on in their lives. The next step for you is to go to /pol/ and weaponize it.
$C: Decent trolling this.
$C: Something something torilla tavataan!
$C: [Depends](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia) on your definition but the traditional definition of Scandinavia is Nor/Swe/Den, the three North European nations that share similar languages and a very similar culture. Finland isn't included because it's a Uralic language, not a Indo-European one, and Finnish culture and cuisine is pretty distinct from the other countries. Also, the Sami people.

Finland is not usually included in the definition of Scandinavia. In fact, this is explicitly the reason why diplomats and geographers use the term "Nordic Countries" to refer to Norway/Sweden/Denmark/Finland/Iceland, because there is no ambiguity as to what nations are included.

But don't worry. You're forgiven.
$C: A comment proving you wrong would be anything but ignorant. Please do not reply with an ignorant comment trying to prove me wrong. 
$C: > is too.

Wait are you actually arguing that Finland *is* part of the Scandinavia?
$C: Hope he doesn't confuse them with mountains.
$C: Can‚Äôt tell if this is an intentional Asian joke or not
$C: r/accidentalracist ?
$C: Bro, oriental is the preferred nomenclature.
$C: And then get piste
$C: Almost certainly long-distance ones, because he lives in a town which afaik doesn't have any local trains ;). Which is probably more chill than driving local ones.
$C: I mean, Ma≈Çysz is now starring in ads for tea and similar stuff, so... Guess he might actually be running out of money 
$C: By no means. Professional sport is not financially rewarding at all. Depending on the sports asspciation, most athletes in the Olympics make enough to live while they do sports, but have not much too save on the side for later.

There is a documentary called ‚ÄúStreif‚Äú that introduced a White Russian skier, driving and sleeping in a van from worldcup to worldcup while his mom is basically his whole ‚Äúteam‚Äú (physiotherapist, cook, mechanic, etc.).
$C: And wants to compete at the Winter Olympics in Japan, should they win the bid. In 2026...........
$C: Rossi is still up there in MotoGP. 2nd place in the championship in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Absolutely bonkers at his age.
$C: Funny answer: Yes, nobody of us has any idea what we are talking about.

Real answer: No. But don't you worry, most of them retired anyway.
$C: He won an Olympic medal in 1994, and is still going at it at a high level. Won an individual silver medal in Sochi four years ago. Truly one of my favorite sportsmen in the world. 
$C: Haha, now that's a name I haven't heard in a long time. A long time.  
   
Matti Nyk√§nen.   
Andi Felder.   
Roger Ruud.  
   

$C: Or a [park ranger](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/a2/a0/9a/a2a09a64fc120c72cc5392cf2b248355--park-rangers-metal-bands.jpg)
$C: > Or a metal band

[Yep.](https://imgur.com/a/Kwxt4)
$C: Or a Sniper that hunts Soviet soldiers. And this concludes everything I know about Finland. 
$C: [Still the best thing that happened at the ESC.](http://www.laut.de/Lordi/lordi-177407.jpg) 
$C: Always in a metal band.

Yeah I've seen metalocalypse.
$C: Or developing smartphones whose company will eventually be jeopardized and sold to Microsoft.
$C: Or a Linux coder
$C: FINNTROLL
$C: I thought those were Swedes
$C: Or a Huckleberry
$C: Nah, that's Norway
$C: Or a defecting stormtrooper. 
$C: Or being an Angry Bird
$C: Sweden is a big metal country I believe 
$C: Amazing country.
$C: Or E-Sports, MATUMBAMAN
$C: Moonsorrow \m/
$C: Or a traitor.
$C: Stay safe. A russian dude died in one of those here.
$C: We call it bad sauna or just Swedish sauna (you can read newspaper there)... /s
$C: While that person might be inconsiderate I doubt it was a macho thing: he has most likely been to sauna few times/week since before he could walk so his tolerance for heat is on another level. Not trying to defend him, it's definitely something Finns should remember when in sauna abroad.
$C: True. I miss my talks with the neighbor back when I lived in Finland. Saw him few times a month outside usually and we talked about once a month.

"quite a weather"

"yep"

And the same thing next month at some point. Good times.

Now here in Norway the neighbor occasionally tries to start a *real* conversation. Dont know what his problem is.
$C: Finns are quite talkative, just empty a bottle of vodka in them.
$C: What's the fun in not revealing deep, dark family secrets to total strangers? 
$C: Also Minnesotan. Which has enough Finn ancestry to begin with.
$C: Maple syrup?
$C: As a Carolinian, that‚Äôs a very good choice. Whenever we get snow it‚Äôs absolute chaos because it doesn‚Äôt happen enough for anyone to have a clue what to do. 
$C: Russia holds back on the off chance Simo H√§yh√§'s death was faked.
$C: Putin had better be on his guard lest they decide to take back the rest of [Karelia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karelia)
$C: In keeping with tradition. 
$C: The Finns still use old Mosin receivers captured in the last kick off, partly as a warning to the Russians.
$C: What's snow hockey?
$C: Yeah, the driver's license part is made up.
Passing the test is hard but not that hard. The actual driving in the snow without getting yourself killed gives you superior car handling skills.
And we also have thousands of kilometers of those backroads to practice on.
$C: Can confirm, when I was 16 we just bought all the old rear wheel drive cars and rallied around backroads. And I‚Äôm a Finn.
$C: Quite. All the advanced testing means the finns aren't as appallingly idiotic drivers in the snow as the rest of us. Otherwise, the country is full of just as shitty drivers as anywhere else. 
$C: LATVALA!
$C: Welcome to SoCal...seriously they're the worst driver's I've experienced in my life.
$C: There is no traffic to speak of in Finland even here in capital area. There are some rush hours but traffic is relatively little (compared to like New York) and the roads have only a couple of lanes to each direction mostly.  It is easy to drive in Finland. But we do have full blown winter and have ample opportunities to learn winter driving skills. Also a lot of small country and dirt roads easily accessible almost anywhere for some casual driving if you are into that....
$C: Finns suck at "social driving" but excel in driving alone in shitty countryside dirt roads. The very basic concept of zipper rule is pretty much unknown outside of Helsinki, and even there it is not understood. Also when there is rush hour, people get pissed when other drivers do the right thing and use the empty lanes before merging, as that is seen as "cutting in line" even though it is the sensible thing to do for flow of traffic.
$C: There's a saying in racing: "If you want to win, employ a Finn."

Personalities cost extra. Whats up with that anyway?
$C: Nah, as long as you're willing to subscribe to our Nordic welfare state values, come on ahead. ;)
$C: Only countries with a decent credit rating. Lol
$C: Nonsense. Welcome /u/JayRadBreh
$C: I wouldn't blame them, we must look like a bunch of anarchist racists from the outside
$C: Yeah don‚Äôt come here. It‚Äôs a shithole 
$C: You're thinking of Sweden
$C: What do fins have against fat hairy guys hanging out at the beach? 
$C: There are no polar bears in Finland. We have brown bears.
$C: Both seasons of Coke ads at the same time tho
$C: Damn. Is there a sport they don‚Äôt do? 
$C: He‚Äôs not finnished

$C: How do your parents cope with the heat here ? you live in Tassie right ?
$C: nah mate he's been here for years
$C: The last hawk we're missing here is Tony Hawk. Then we have all the hawks we need.
$C: That man has style.
$C: No, that's actually him without a mask.
$C: Nightmare fuel
$C: Impressive.
$C: Oh, well fuck you too, buddy
$C: You're just the worst kind of person.
$C: How dare you 
$C: Lmfao! What was actually coming out of the water? A gator?
$C: Wha do I always have to fucking fall for that shit? And why am I laughing every fucking time?
$C: Whenever the subreddit /r/rupaulsdragrace shows up i kept thinking it was a subreddit about a guy named RuPaul DaGrace
$C: Ah, no worries then. [^^^But ^^^seriously](http://i.imgur.com/dxF4NOf.gif)
$C: Haha. Well..... 50% of population lives in that southern part! 1/3 of a year is winter in south while 2/3 of a year in north. I live in Tallinn so pretty much same temperatures with helsinki but I know someone who moved to northern Finland and he is complaining about long winters all the time. He is in polar night region so winters are quite dark. 
$C: In a lot of cultures emotion comes more from the eyes than the mouth, if you look at his eyes you can see that he's smiling more clearly.
$C: Third one looks like he had just become a father or won the lottery.
$C: Yessss queen
$C: Haha, I bet you kiss girls!
$C: Does that mean he's gone?
$C: No he doesn‚Äôt. Just packs up and leaves. Hotels hate him
$C: He's Popeye the skiing man!
$C: And for anyone who's wondering what comes after that for a teenage ski jumping prodigy with a drinking problem and a crippling back injury: [It's actually funnier than you might think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UflMjAEZ0hU&)
$C: Harri Olli tried to do that as well, didn't quite work out as well.

$C: "why are you laughing at that?"
$C: no you are
$C: I have a feeling it was a joke, as in the person who regularly uses 'lol' would get your and you're wrong.
$C: Your so funny lol
$C: Is their any joke that you understand without someone explaining it too you? You should probably have someone proof read you're replies to make sure your not making a fool of you'reself.

She's the only Fin on the team though. The other four are males from Jordan, Bulgaria, Lebanon and Germany, respectably. However the team member from Jordan is a deity who has chosen to take on the physical body of a human male. The team, aptly called "Team Liquid" is a very inclusive and gender fluid. 
$C: I mean, Noriaki Kasai, the *1992* Ski Flying world champion, is still active too.
$C: You might have been watching him jump 20 years ago, because he's been jumping since 1992.
$C: yes, which suggests that Finnish ski jumpers are not very good if they can't compete with a retired one
$C: They're good at wearing tons of orange.  That should be an Olympic sport.

$C: >Other than j√§nk√§ "bog", "lauta" "board" and "puoli "half", it does not obviously mean anything in Finnish, *and was probably never intended to be anything else than alliterative gibberish.*
$C: My father has one Finnish friend. Michael. He is the most deadpan person I've ever seen, let alone met. When we were younger we'd occasionally go to his family's house for dinner, and at some point around 10pm he would go and get the serious stuff out for after-dinner drinks. At a certain age we kids were allowed to get involved, though obviously in a very restricted context. For about two hours he would be a source of great humour involving much back-slapping, then he'd just say "okay I'm going to bed", and then go to bed. Next time we saw him:

Dad: Great night the other week!

Michael: Yes.
$C: My dad takes a Finnish guy to Russia as a designated drinker because he's the only one at the consulting firm who can drink the Russians under the table. 
$C: yup, sounds like the best possible social situation I could think of!

$C: ja mik√§ helvetin finnland
$C: From what I can find out in the [official inland lake database](https://www.nve.no/karttjenester/kartdata/vassdragsdata/innsjodatabase/), all the lakes in the database (around 243,000) are larger than 2,500m^2. The difference between that number and the larger 450,000 accounts for the lakes smaller than that, which matches the information here: https://snl.no/innsj%C3%B8

According to the info in the Encyclopedia there (which references the Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management's Water Information database), if you count *all* the lakes you get 969,100. which is... quite a few.
$C: quick maffs


$C: Possibly, but Finland *is* known as the land of a thousand lakes, and I've heard this repeated my whole life...

Learning to small talk sober seems to be absolutely impossible for us.
$C: Even in Norway - and we're not exactly the most outgoing types ourselves - Finns are known for that. They're the people who will turn up at your party with a fifth of vodka, drink it themselves, and fall asleep, fight or both.

There's the joke about two Finnish childhood friends running into each other - they agree to go out to drink and catch up. They arrive at the bar, order vodka. Eventually, the first guy goes "so... how have you been?". The second guy scowls at him, and after a long pause, says - "Did you come here to drink or did you come here to chat?"

$C: Geographically no, but culturally it kind of is.
$C: IIRC isn't there a distinction between Scandinavian and Nordic? The Finns are not a North Germanic people, but geographically they are in Scandinavia. Or maybe they're Nordic but not Scandinavian? I don't remember which way it goes but one term is cultural and one is geographical.
$C: [Fennoscandia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fennoscandia).
$C: hmm, maybe kinda more like - inhumane, gender inequal restraint politics

$C: K√§nninen?
$C: Ok. You‚Äôre just a tit. Or even better troller than I can understand. 
$C: I apologise for those mistakes then.

But the general gist of my comment was this : 

Scandinavia traditionally did not include Finland and nowadays may or may not include it. So just say Fennoscandia. Alternatively, if you don't want people to think you're a geography nerd, say Nordic countries and there's no ambiguity. 

Agreed?

$C: > Don't reply unless you agree.

Sorry but it isn't about agreeing or disagreeing. I know for a fact that Finland is not part of Scandinavia and there are various sources you can find that out from. If you really "disagree", I'd love to see some sources or hear where you base that "opinion" on. Surely you haven't just made that up by yourself to refer to it as a fact? That would be the definition of ignorant.

EDIT: are you confusing it with either "fennoscandia" or "nordic countries"? nordic countries and scandinavia are often mixed up and used as synonyms but if we are geographically exact, they are different.

That does not add up. We would not have any unemployment problem here in Finland if it did. But there are 5 million people and 3 million saunas, average of 1 sauna per household.

And yes, i'm a Finn.
$C: Merging, alternating one lane with another.
$C: Eh, it's ranked as easier to learn than Arabic, Chinese, Korean and especially Japanese for native English speakers ;), and plenty of people learn those too.

The US Foreign Service Institute ranks Finnish as requiring a little under a year of full-time study to reach their "General Professional Proficiency" ranking. Compare to the easiest ones (most Germanic and Romance languages) still requiring a bit over half a year, and the hardest (listed previously) requiring ~20 months.
$C: I don't know why they call it Helsinki when's it's clearly above sea level. It should be called Helfloati.

$C: I admire it, to be honest. I'm Scottish so maybe there's some northern European thing at work there; I don't know.

If there's something interesting to be said then it isn't boring and so isn't small talk by definition. If it's funny then it's funny, and no excuses are needed. If it's neither interesting nor funny then what's the point other than to fill time?
$C: I survive by being drunk all the time.

$C: If we have to do it, we'll do it. When someone asks for help or directions, we will most likely help.

We're just really stubborn to take initiative.
$C: Been living now abroad in two different countries (both in Europe, though). In Finland, my friends consider me as a very social individual and the master of small talk - however the struggle is real abroad. We finns just seem to really struggle compared to any other nationality.

The final boss to finnish social skills is nightclubs - imagine someone coming directly at your skin, maybe touching and staring you directly in the eye. It's horrible.
$C: And I wonder how foreigner survive in Finland. Do you guys just reserve emotions for the love ones? Just came back from a travel to Rovaniemi. Our Airbnb hostess is Ukrainian, the cutest adult human being I‚Äôve ever met. But I have no idea how to deal with her husband, a native Laplander. Although I know that he‚Äôd laugh for TV shows and with his wife. 

And the Swedes are not much better honestly. Nordic people problem I guess? 
$C: Just fine. Moved out in 1995.

$C: I am completely fine with being called Eastern European, but technically Finland is just in Northern Europe, a Nordic country. :3
$C: > they'll fight you

That's their national motto.
$C: That's why we call them a part of the nordics
$C: Yeah, saying that we aren't part of Scandinavia is technically correct but little more than semantics at this point. Geographically Denmark seems like the outlier as opposed to Finland. Culturally we are all the same.

There are some things that keep us "separate" like language and stuff, but still. The only people who get annoyed when people call Finland a scandinavian country are people who desperately just want to correct people to make themselves seem smart.

$C: HE looks like her. Wrong direction!
$C: [Tarja Halonen for President](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuPb4jvPrNM)
$C: There is also her sister, Maski Halonen who's  claimed to be the worst berry picker of them all. 
$C: > Tarja Halonen

They look like they could be related, but he doesn't look like her. 
$C: > Maski Hallonen (1921-1947) was forced as a twenty-year-old by the Finnish army to migrate to Sweden together with one hundred other young pimples. Their mission was to collect money for the war effort on the home front, cost what it cost. The young men sought jobs at several industries, but had no luck. In the end, the warriors had to pick berries to raise money for the foster country. 
In Sweden there has been a word about the Hallonen, where he calls him Finland's poorest berry picker because of his lustful meaning in Swedish. The truth is that Hallonen was doing well. Not the best, but good. What he liked about joke was never discovered when he shortly after his return to Finland died in the suites after a fall of the parasitic disease testicular gastgot.

Maski Hallonen sounds like a riot.
$C: Its been ages since i heard this one.
$C: Jeg lo
$C: What the perkele
$C: you forgot the great boxer Rantaruntiringen.
$C: Well, I'm brazillian, we banned those in 2009.
$C: I too was looking for those. Thanks!
$C: I had never heard of him, but wow. What a complete badass!
$C: Yes he is. His real name is Ville Virtanen, although first off, my guess is very few Finns know that either (I didn't, had to look it up), and also, that name is so generic it's basically the equivalent of "John Smith". Virtanen is literally the 2nd most common surname in Finland.
$C: Funny thing is that it's he
$C: That was the previous president, Tarja Halonen.  We're just in the midst of voting a new president here.  The incumbent is Sauli Niinist√∂, who is a few months shy of 70 years of age.  He and his second wife are expecting their first child, though it will be his third child.    
$C: \* Valtteri
$C: I know them, I just didn't know they were finnish. I'm a pretty much casual F1 fan.

I mean, Valtteri Bottas sound italian as fuck, and I assumed Keke was german because of Nico.

Mika Salo is a name I haven't heard in a long time.
$C: TIME TO DIE!
$C: In a surprise offensive.  With German support.  That isn't to diminish the Finns, but it's hardly the same picture that Russia used to justify their own aggression.   
$C: Thank you. This is right up my alley, humor-wise.
$C: Finns don't do bar snacks. It interferes with their drinking. "drinkin is sirios bisnes"

$C: Small talk isn't boring by definition, it's supposed to be interesting. The first part of it is boring, but it's mapping out what the other person finds interesting so you can talk about that, then it's interesting. But many people are bad at it.

There's your problem. As a Finn who has spent a lot of time in Lapland I can tell you this: those people are on another level weird. Good weird but still weird.

Again, it's not about agreeing, disagreeing or making compromises my friend. If you know for a fact that it is, but can't even tell why you "know for a fact" then you are just making it up and are so ignorant and stubborn that you can't see past it.

No one is really due. Germany hosted their last in 1972, so get in line, I guess? Just an example :)

Between 2002 and 2026, that's barely 11 events that USA didn't host. So it's really not that bad, imo. 

After some extra search, I realized you host the 2028 Summer Olympics anyway. It's fine, really :D

$C: Noooo, Iceland elected Vigd√≠s Finnbogad√≥ttir in 1984!
$C: Vigdis Finnbogadottir was (1980-1996 president of Iceland)
$C: Didn't Iceland have a female President quite a while ago?
$C: I'm Finnish and these are all mysteries for me 
$C: They're Swedish joke names, not real people.
$C: Oh poo. It was a she at one point right?
$C: For more details, his 2nd wife is actually 2 years younger than his older son, and I think at least some of his grandkids are teenagers by now. However, I think we might note here that he didn't divorce his first wife; she died in a car crash when his younger son was still a teenager.

Niinist√∂ also survived the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, and his nephew is the ex-chair of the Finnish green party.
$C: ty, never get that one right
$C: Nico Rosberg holds dual nationality, and briefly competed for Finland early in his racing career
$C: YOU'RE IN THE BULLET'S WAY,
$C: I dont think, we wouldve stood a chance against Russia, if they had more forces. But the wars became too expensive and thus Russia retreated.

And it was enough for the time being. Of course we glorify what happened but we stood our ground for what seemed a doomed attempt.

Oh. And about the Germans. They supplied weapons, not men. And after that they left through arctic circle to Norway and Sweden, burning everything behind.

We aint too happy about that either.
$C: You're right. But also, some of those front lines did stay about the same until the end of the Continuation War, especially in the north.

The [Suur-Suomi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Finland) people were even a bit crazier, though... and the maps on that page don't even give the full picture, the craziest claims/proponents of that idea were that we should push the Russians back over the Urals. No idea where they thought the southern border would be (maybe roughly following the 60th parallel?), or what we would even *do* with all that taiga.
$C: The FSI teaches languages to career diplomats, agents and the like afaik. They also study the stuff full time as basically their job, circumstances which indeed don't apply to most people.

Regardless, I would view the relative lengths as more important than the absolute length of study for this or that level.

$C: Swap it around and become a Finn called Scot. Everyone will assume you're Scottish because you're called Scot and you'll still have a Scottish accent, but you'll also enjoy the many benefits of being Finnish that this thread has opened our eyes to.

The only downside is that when your new Finnish drinking associates hear you being called 'Finn' by your old Scottish friends, they'll assume that everyone in Scotland goes around talking like an Elder Scrolls NPC. "What do you want, Imperial?"
$C: *maahanmuuttovirasto*   yeah, right, like that's a word. We all know that it's just a big practical joke.
$C: When you don‚Äôt talk you don‚Äôt need the language!!!
$C: You'll fit right in with the other immigrants.
$C: No grammatical gender though, so we've got German, French, Spanish etc. beat on that one. Heck, even the Scandinavian languages. English is one of relatively few Indo-European languages which has lost grammatical gender, afaik... and btw Middle English still had 4 noun cases too, even though modern English has none (Finnish has 15).

Finnish also has near-perfectly phonetic spelling.

That said, it's still probably easier for e.g. Estonians (obviously), Hungarians or even Turks to learn Finnish because those are all fairly heavily agglutinative languages too (even though Hungarian is only fairly distantly related and Turkish not at all), while modern English is almost completely not agglutinative at all.
$C: "Koirinennekokaan" is a form of the word "koira", which means dog.

$C: Well, there's certainly a few situations where someone might get citizenship at birth without knowing Finnish or Swedish (the two national languages), but yea, if you want/need citizenship by naturalization, among other requirements you generally do need to fulfill some language proficiency requirements. Some (fairly few) exceptions are made, with the official guidelines for when an exemption is most likely being that either you're already at least 65 years old, have some sort of medical reason for being exempt from studying the language, or moved here as an illiterate adult.
$C: Which segment of Christianity do you represent? Catholic? Protestant? Lutheran? Mormons? Jehova‚Äôs witnesses? Some other?

$C: I have done a little research, my apologies!

"Hostilities ceased in March 1940 with the signing of the Moscow Peace Treaty. Finland ceded territory representing 11% of its land area and 30% of its economy to the Soviet Union ..."
$C: Finland won bit of territory with the help of Nazi germany during the second world war, but since it was allied with the "losing side of the war" Finland had to give those lands to Russia at the end of the war.

And many original residents of eastern Finland lost their homes because of that.

But without German tanks and air forces Finland would've never been able to hold back the overwhelming yet badly organized soviet army (the fact that Soviet army basically just marched in open formation towards Finnish lines might've been huge cause for the high kill count on Simo H√§yh√§'s part).
$C: do you have any more information on that? would it be the Battle of Ilomantsi? sadly my grandfather has passed, I was very young when he was telling me these stories - I would love to do some research to truly understand what he was talking about
$C: Ireland has had two female presidents (taking office in 1990 and 1997 resp.), making Tarja Halonen fourth. Oh wait, there‚Äôs a Maltese lady, and three Swiss, a Lithuanian and those SAN Marinese captain regents... (but you beat Sweden to it, which is all that reslly matters).

$C: I think Finnish sounds really cool and is very unique.  The hardest thing for me in Germany though is that people are reticent to speak with learners, is the situation the same in a place like Helsinki ?
$C: agglutinative means the language takes words and bits of words and glues them together to form bigger words when describing a complex thing, rather than using a group of grammatically connected words to express the same concept.

$C: Damn. How on earth did I not get that.
$C: /r/expectedsabaton 
$C: Well kinda, I was going by "maahan-" being the "into-country" etc. But yeah, if you break that down further, the suffix comes later, but then the breakdown just loses it's last bit of grammatical sense...
$C: I don't know if Helsinki would be better in that regard. Usually the problem you run into is that chances are the Finn is just as exited to get to practice their English as you are to practice your Finnish :D
$C: I think most people here appreciate that you are trying to speak Finnish. 
$C: Ahh, like German and the Scandinavian languages does too?
$C: good luck talking swedish in Finland. 
$C: NOrWAY!
$C: Oh yah?
$C: Where do we put the Japanese?
$C: "Sometimes also". Look at the word Sometimes. Also "the broader region which includes Finland and Iceland. This broader region is usually known locally as the Nordic countries."
$C: Thank you all 
$C: Yea, although they have less conjugation as Finnish etc. and aren't really considered "agglutinative", although the grouping they belong to still retains some conjugation. I would describe agglutinative languages as ones that rely heavily on conjugation, inflection etc. instead of separate pronouns and "helper words" etc. Swedish, German etc. already use a fair bit of pronouns, prepositions etc.

E.g. Many native American language groups and languages are agglutinative, as are the Fenno-Ugric ones (at least mostly), Turkish, Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, and Basque, plus e.g. Bantu and Austronesian languages. 

There's a theory/observed trend that over long enough periods of time (hundreds to thousands of years):

* agglutinative languages will tend to drift to become what's called fusional synthetic languages, conveying e.g. both a tense and first-person form with one conjugation suffix instead of one per change like in agglutinative languages. They inclue many if not most Indo-European languages, e.g. Sanskrit, Punjabi, Hindustani, Greek, Latin and the Iberian Romance languages, the Baltic languages, German, the Scandinavian languages and most Slavic languages
* Fusional synthetic languages drift to become analytic/non-synthetic languages, "primarily conveying elationships between words in sentences by way of 'helper' words like particles, prepositions etc. and word order. Middle English used to be more on the agglutinative/synthetic side, with word order being more free but nouns had case endings and there was more conjugation; modern English is analytic, with word order carrying more meaning. Chinese and Bulgarian are some other examples.
* A related or perhaps even more extreme form of analytic languages, that they in turn are thought to trend to, are isolating languages, with Vietnamese as the prime example, where there are very few morphemes ("units of meaning" might be one description), and no inflections or conjugation of any sort. I.e. whereas a agglutinative language might have one word for "I wonder if I saw" (very possible e.g. in Finnish, "n√§ink√∂h√§n", which coincidentally also means "was it so"/"was this how it was" from a different root), which has 4 morphemes, I think, as English still combines the 2 morphemes of see+past tense into one word, but "wonder if" is here a translation of the Finnish potential tense/mood and thus I'm counting it as 1 morpheme, a purely isolating language would literally say that as something like "I maybe see past" and that would be considered a phrase/sentence than a single word.
* The theory is then that isolating languages loop back around to agglutinative ones, presumably (= this is my guess on the theory) by individual morphemes becoming simpler, and the multiple simple morphemes then merging so that you have long, conjugated words again.

And of course, no language is really completely purely in one category, even though a primary category (or maybe two) is probably fairly easy to assign to most languages.
$C: You mean outside the Swedish speaking areas
$C: Dontcha know!
$C: they are basically irradiated Americanism.  and yes Im aware of the nuclear reference.

japan is a completely de facto american colony even to this day having been defeated in the war and never broke away.  in fact they dont even have an army as part of the post war agreement.

having said that, the japanese are my personal choice for a race to run the planet.  they suck at inventing things, but damn they make everything better.  they are a quality people of an even higher IQ than the whites.


$C: Exactly, it's sometimes also.  Which makes me right.  If I was wrong it wouldn't be in the list at all. Don't bother replying unless it's to apologize.  Thank you.
$C: You got those linguistic facts locked down!
$C: yes but theyre pretty small part. english works fine in Finland
$C: I'm not so sure I agree 100% with your police work there, Lou.
$C: Didn‚Äôt want to answer quickly to this. Read your words carefully several times and am left positively baffled. Firstly, you seem to be very well educated. Secondly, you‚Äôre not stick to ‚Äòwhite intellectual religious men‚Äô alone. 

I haven‚Äôt said so far pretty much anything about my background and so be it, because I‚Äôm not the key here, but I have to ask: where does this prone to Christianity come from? 
$C: Lmao what a fucking dense idiot are you
$C: Heh, wikipedia does. ;) Often (and in this case too) I'm aware of the stuff and remember it roughly, but I check wikipedia to get the terms right and so I can include better info. Keeping things a bit more concise is still something of a challenge, but I'd rather be informative enough than too short.
$C: im guessing that English is not your first language, so forgive me if I get the question wrong...

but to answer (i hope in the right way), my promoting Christianity comes from a long journey into atheism where I found it lacking on multiple levels.

if one is to go to science for results, then science says the culture that creates the strongest group will ultimately be the strongest one.  religion serves the purpose of providing rules that government cannot, but religion is important.  it tells us how to properly prepare for the next generation to make our group stronger as a whole.  

some religions are good at this, some are not.  history shows us which ones work.


$C: No, you're the dense one here.  Check in the dictionairy what 'sometimes' and 'also' mean.  Hint: they don't mean not or never.
$C: I feel the same!
$C: Firstly, you‚Äôre spot on; English is not my first language. Though you got my question right. 

Is it really so that according to the science the one who gets the biggest supports wins - that‚Äôs Darwinism, eh? Not so much as the religious point of view? 

I‚Äôve found religions to be sub-society contexts/frameworks in managing the masses, from the people, for the people, god being just the abstract tool or excuse. 

Having said that I do understand that atheism in its pure form is... well, a bit shallow. As if we as human beings would understand everything around. We don‚Äôt. 
$C: https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-18618,00.html
$C: agreed!

religion sets rules for how a family should be run.  the rest is details.

government can decide the direction of a country but they cannot decide how a family is run without serious problems. 

this is why religion is important. the family is the core of any good society.
$C: I agree on the importance of families to the society, and individuals(!) - but that‚Äôs as far as I go myself.

Nearly all Muslim families I know have great depth, warmth and integrity within them - some not, depending on the individuals not the religion. No difference to Christian families I know (which I know more of course). 

Though living without any religious based values doesn‚Äôt mean you can mess it up so no need to be hypocritical here. 

I find religions, any of them including Buddhism somewhat corrupted frameworks. They have a lot of good in them but are still failing in the last hurdles. I‚Äôm read some bible and koran and find no significant difference between them. 

But that‚Äôs just my personal view. 

$C: the problem i have with islam first and foremost is that they are not just allowed but encouraged to inbreed.

do this over hundreds of years and you have a group of people so backwards they actually think blowing themselves up taking children down with them is the way to heaven.

i have no respect for a people that intentionally inbreed
