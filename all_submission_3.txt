Heat index was 110 degrees so we offered him a cold drink. He went for a full body soak instead

$C: He judged the hell out of you and decided you were safe.
$C: You may have saved his little life. 
$C: *Moisturize me*
$C: It’s the happy wriggle that does me in.
$C: Frogs drink through their skin, so you cooled him off and quenched him.  Way to go frog bro.
$C: I thought it couldn't get any cuter 

^And ^then ^the ^little ^cutie ^nestled ^right ^in
$C: "I accept your offering. You can now care for me for the rest of your life."

"Hello my baby, hello my darling, hello my ragtime gal!"
$C: This should be in r/HumansBeingBros
$C: You give the frog water to drink. Unknown to you, the frog pledges a life debt to you. In your darkest hour, the frog arrives. 
$C: When life hands you a tiny swimming pool.... 
$C: Just have to say that anyone who would notice a random tree frog on a hot day, then go get him a drink, is destined to make the world a better place. Keep up the good work.
$C: Funny enough, throughout my life I never realized tree frogs were so small. Never saw one in real life, and the only pictures i occasionally saw were close up.
$C: That is so cute.. And it fits in that tiny cap, wasn't expecting that!
$C: He literally looks at the person filming before looking at the water and getting in. He steps in as if he may have to jump out, but apparently likes the tasty water, and gets more comfortable. This is some Wind in the Willows type shit.
$C: It must have been so grateful. Just imagine crawling around a wall and a floating mini personal pool comes right up to you. 
$C: If I fits, I sits
$C: What happened after that? Did you set him down in some shade?

$C: Love this post 🙂 
$C: Nothing like heat to make a wild animal love humans. I live in Australia and the summers are quite harsh so once we had a parrot struggling in our back yard so I took him some water in a bowl and he instantly flew onto my head and starting flying down into the water to cool off. After about 15 mins once he cooled down he realised that he didn't need me anymore and the bastard bit my ear and flew off. 
$C: My parents have a little tree frog that lives in an outdoor umbrella in their backyard in Atlanta. Whenever I’m there I take a spray bottle and spritz it like crazy, little dude must be hot. 
$C: Now he won’t croak!
$C: You are a very good human OP!!
$C: I love you OP. ♥️ You just gave that frog the best day of his little life. 
$C: Ha that's great, I was expecting him to have a little slurp... Nope "dis my paddlin' pool"😁 
$C: You rule 
$C: Ah, retreat!  The giant naked ape is here to eat me!

Strange tactics.  What is that water? A portable pond? 

 Well, I shouldn't be rude.  I will dip for just a moment.  

Ahhh, that's what my green needed.  Thank you kind citizen.
$C: The cold water on his hot skin must have felt absolutely ribbiting.
$C: *wiggle wiggle* ahhhhh...
$C: Not many things here make me actually say 'aww' out loud, this is such an awesome little clip
$C: This leapt into my heart!
$C: I like the part when he settles in and gets comfy. 
$C: Frogs actually drink through their skin so it make perfect (if adorable) sense.
$C: DID ANYONE NOTICE THE FROG PUT THAT LITTLE CHIN ON THE GUY’S THUMB?!?! I just noticed and my cold, dead heart melted a little. 
$C: I love frogs. They’re so sweet. Thank you OP for taking the time to do this. 

sidetone: if you roll them over on their back and rub their belly they will fall asleep. 
$C: People like you restore my faith in humanity! With all the crap in the world you make a froggy happy with a cap full of water ❤ we all can learn from that!
$C: Froggo does a soak
$C: My name is Frogg

I am so hot

Here comes a man

What has he got?

It is some water

So nice and cool

I will not drink my

New swimming pool!
$C: He fit perfect in there!
$C: He's so cute! What a relief you must have given him 😊
$C: You have earned the blessings of Kek. You will have meme magic in your life for 420 years.
$C: In addition to frogs being cold blooded they also drink through an osmotic patch of skin on their bellies.  So you did him a double favor but giving him a drink and some much needed cooling off.


$C: Good on you. But just for reference frogs don’t regulate their body temperature by sweating so heat index doesn’t effect them. Only the air temperature is what they feel. 
$C: I found a dead lizard today by my house. Nothing wrong with him other than being dried out. I think he was dehydrated so we just put a random bowl of water on our porch for them 
$C: What dis? Ah, pool? For me?? Why, thank you human!!
$C: Tiniest wading pool.
$C: https://i.imgur.com/hJeW2wX.jpg
$C: This is one of the cutest “giving an animal water” videos so far. Ahhh so cute
$C: I love frogs so small that their swimming pool is a bottle cap. So cute.
$C: If a 200-foot giant presented me with a kiddie pool while I was clinging to a cliff, I probably would climb in too.  I mean, at that point, how could that possibly be my worst option?
$C: This is so wholesome. 
$C: You’re a damn saint. 
$C: Omg the way he scrooches down in it is SO CUTE
$C: It's been 3 full days since your plane crashed in this god forsaken desert and you are hungry, alone, and thirsty. Just when you were about to give up on life and welcome death into your arms, You see him. That frog you saved all those years ago. 

You could still remember how hot it was that day and how happy the frog looked as he jumped into that bottlecap filled with water. The frog remembered that too for he owes his life to you.

The frog looks at you then suddenly hops away, then out of instinct, you follow the frog until he leads you to a small oasis. You hop in and splash around. You drink and feel refreshed. Now the frog has fulfilled his promise he made all those years ago. Then the frog could finally be free. Be free of this cruel, cruel world.
$C:  congrats on making it to the top posts of all time
$C: So since we’re talking about caring for small animals here I thought I’d bring up my awkward story from today! I was driving back from the store through my complex when I saw all these kids huddled around something round and brown. I assumed it was a baby bird because those fall out of trees all the time in my apartment complex and I’ve rescued quite a few. They were all kind of poking at it and looking really interested so I was 99% sure it was an animal. I park my car, and start to walk over. As I’m getting the closer one of the boys picks up a big rock and slams it on whatever they are looking at. I freak out and shout while running over “NO WHAT ARE YOU DOING!” They all look at me, a crazy strange adult woman yelling at them like what the fuck? I look down and there’s no animal. It’s just playdoh. The mom then comes out and gives me an intense death stare. I anxiously explain that I thought it was an animal and I rescue birds that fall out of trees in the complex but she wasn’t amused. I walked away and physically cringed at how awkward it was. 

Welp that’s it 
$C: Kind of amazing 
$C: Stupid question..... did you choose that bottle cap on purpose?? He would not have been able to fit in a smaller pop bottle cap.  Everything about this is just perfect.  Thank You!!!
$C: I love how he shuffled all the way to the front so it looked like he was resting his chin on the finger :’) 
$C: Doing God’s work my friend. I have no gold but two thumbs and I raise them to you 
$C: Frogs are specially equipped with a small pouch like area on there chest that let's them drink by absorbing water through there skin. 
$C: That wiggle😍
$C: Okay so when the water warmed up you made sure to refill it with more cold water right?
$C: He *is* drinking while soaking! That’s how frogs do it! You’re a good hooman!
$C: When you come from a long day at work and get in the pool
$C: Omg I love this. Little green frogs are seriously the cutest
$C: Gud freg
$C: "Ahhhhhhhhh, nice." Frog probably.
$C: He just risked his life for some water. Thanks for being awesome OP
$C: I love the sheer appreciation and relief on his face. He was like, “Ugh, don’t fuck with me, it’s too hot.” Then was pleasantly surprised to realize you weren’t going to kill him. 
$C: Sooo sweet! Ty for doing that.  Most people wouldn't even think to do that (myself included). I know now!
$C: /r/HumansBeingBros 
$C: That frog looked at the camera/human and was like “are you serious? For me? Okay, don’t mind if I do!” 
$C: My wife is absolutely 100% *mortified* by even the sight of frogs.

I thought maybe... Juuuuuuuust *maybe* this tiny lil guy would crack even the lightest grin.

Nope.

This gets my upvote nonetheless. 
$C: Quick, sign a contract with him!

Youll be able to summon him when youre in a tough spot 
$C: You're an awesome person. Frog greatly appreciated that. He can absorb moisture threw his skin so. Great to see there's still caring people out there. Not morons who'd try to crush it or set it on fire. Sick world we live in. Tree frogs are awesome. If you got him on your hand you could feel the sticky pads on his feet heh. 
$C: You offered him a sipp, he took a dipp
$C:  Frogs don’t physically drink water, they absorb water directly through their skin in an area known as the 'drinking patch' located on their belly and the underside of their thighs. 

EDIT: Just realized this has been commented before.
$C: He will tell his spawn the tale of the day a mythical godgiant saved him with a flying pond. 
$C: You have a frog a bath and now you're the #3 post of all time
$C: I sent this to four of my friends and their responses were so sweet, they're all 17-19 year old dudes.  

"so cute. so fucking cute"

"THEY BABY"

"Big fucking mood
He's drinking tho, thas how they do that"

"happy!!!!!!!!!!"


I love my friends

$C: This post is going to be one of the top posts of reddit and i feel so happy because people can learn from it and do the same 
$C: Thats how they drink
$C: You know a post is good when it's #1 on r/aww, and has almost 300k upvotes and it's filled vertically 
$C: And now you have a frog. 
$C: Here for history. 
$C: r e f r e s h e d b o i
$C: Heckin frog doin a hydrate 
$C: Long live Pepe!
$C: Oh lord that is insanely cute. Well done you.
$C: It rubs the water on its skin so that it rehydrates again
$C: 110°??? Why aren't you boiling?!?!
$C: R/humansbeingbros
$C: As soon as he realized it was water, his need for moisture overcame his fear of humans. Such a sweet thing to see. Thank you for being such a kind person and even noticing the plight of such a little creature.
$C: Frogs don’t “drink”, they absorb water through their skin!
$C: amphibians absorb water through their skin so this was the same thing as a drink to him.
$C: This is so fucking cute I actually gasped and made a weird squealing noise... he’s so happy in his tiny little pool 😭😭😭
$C: Frogs can drink though their skin
$C: You're a good person OP. Keep being a bro to all beings big and small 
$C: TIL Reddit loves frog.. super cute though 
$C: Fun fact: Frogs and toads don’t drink water they absorb it through their skin
$C: That little wiggle after he got in the cap! 
$C: Cutest thing I've ever seen 
P. S.  You guys are nice to help a lil froggie 
$C: Wouldn't that be a... full body *croak*? Haha... I'll see myself out...

$C: “Don’t worry froggie, I’ll keep you moist”
$C: Aw little wet froge
$C: We don't deserve frogs...
$C: Imagine being stranded in the desert, and a gigantic hand stretches out of nowhere with a perfectly human-shaped ice cold full bathtub for you. 
$C: Its a frog sitting in a bottle cap cooling off! It’s so cute!!!
$C: This is truly r/bettereveryloop
$C: I like how he elegently submerges himself. I was expecting a good ole' belly smacker. 
$C: Froggies drink through their skin! So he DID take a drink!
$C: 240k upvotes?!? I've never seen anything like that holy fuck 
$C: u/stabbot
$C: Cutest little green I’ve ever seen. 
$C: Frogs drink through their skin, so you cooled him off and quenched him. Way to go frog bro.
$C: Is this the last day we can comment?
$C: So cute
$C: Hopefully that water wasn't chlorinated
$C: Man, top post of all time!
$C: Technically, he took you up on the offer. Amphibians absorb moisture the their skin instead of physically drinking water. His little scoot in the cap was him maximizing his surface area inside the water. Good job caring for the little guy!
$C: 43,3 ºC
$C: [deleted]
$C: The most precious
$C: R/humansbeingbros
$C: Squirrel Frog! Omg! I love them so much they are so cute! 
$C: "I wanna dip my BALLS in it!"  

-The State-
$C: You’re awesome! Very kind thing to do and the lil fella appreciate it. 
$C: Well, they're yours now. Take good care of 'em.
$C: This frog is so cute. The backyard looks heavenly too. 
$C: r/soakies
$C: We've been getting a huge heat wave here too, +30's and above, which is crazy hot for where I live.  I never even thought of this but I should probably put large water bowls outside for various animals that may be desperate for water or a place to cool off. 
$C: Thank you for helping Frogger 🙂 This video is adorable.
$C: I love how it starts off suspicious, then realizes that there's a nice little pool of water.
$C: I don’t know why but all frogs have an Australian accent in my mind. 
$C: Any way this was in Texas? Because we were melting today. 
$C: I mean look at the size of the container you offered him! He obviously thought you were offering a bath.

If someone pushed a bathtub full of water towards you would you think... oh, a drink?
$C: If i fits, i sits
$C: You have saved Slippy's life. In the future when there's a space invasion, he'll be the first one at your house to escort you out of Earth. 
$C: Didn’t knew this sub but this video popped up in my feed, my exact reaction was aww, then I saw the subs name 
$C: r/Humansbeingbros
$C: That lil dude just hit the fucking jackpot.
$C: My fear of frogs has been cured
$C: r/HumansBeingBros
$C: Thank you for your kindness and compassion :)
$C: * pivot.
* 1 long stare into your soul.
* alright human.
$C: r/humansbeingbros
$C: Thank you, my dudes
$C: you saved his life.. i've seen my fair share of dehydrated frogs 
$C: Get to 1M!!
$C: If I fits, I sits
$C: Butt wiggle and all. 
$C: I want everyone to use the term "froggo" 

IT'S SO CUTE >_<
$C: Thank you for doing this!! Making the world a better place, one frog at a time :)
$C: frogs skin is permeable to water, his wiggle squat was moistening and drinking though his skin.
you did a good deed OP.
$C: For an amphibian, full body soak is a drink. Good on you, kind sir
$C: I think this is my favourite thing ever on Reddit to date! 
$C: Awwww that’s adorable 
$C: Frogs can drink through their skin so technically it is having a drink
$C: Green boy doin an absorb
$C: So wholesome. I love the way it looks at you like, "what? Really? That's mine? Nice....ahhhhhhhh, refreshing."
$C: Should make a little rock pool in your garden area without pets. If you have frogs its a good sign that you probably have alot of creepy crawlies around that probably need water too. Pot bases are great with a few rocks in them and some fresh water. We do it for all our wildlife in summer! big and small!

And i dont like frogs at all! But in the heat im happy to help anything in need!!! 
$C: Holy crap, this is currently the second highest voted post on r/aww of all time!
$C: Frogs “drink” through their skin btw. So technically he’s drinking and bathing :D
$C: Many types of frogs drink through their skin and not their mouth as one would think. That is probably why he/she went into the water, to get a drink. Google it. Still extremely adorable. Great post.
$C: Boopity Boop, Bappity Bap, There's a Tree frog in my Bottle Cap. 💓
$C: The heat here has been really intense as well and the poor jackdaws and crows are all panting and look miserable. We saw some grouped around a small, shallow puddle in the road, taking quick sips, so we bought some water on our ice cream run and poured it into their puddle for them. 
$C: Wow this became the top post of all time in just 9 hours!
$C: This is very adorable. I truly do love frogs, they’re just so cute. However, I absolutely would have screamed, dropped the cap, and retreated quickly at the moment he looks up. They’re so unpredictable and that’s the one thing that terrifies me about frogs. Face leaping little shits.
$C: Don’t amphibians “drink” through their skin though? Correct me if I’m wrong. Little dude very well may be getting a drink after all. 
$C: I wish I had the video still, but I ran into a similar situation in Queensland. This guy was just parked on the bench in like 34 degree heat, tilting his head towards the shower.

https://imgur.com/xvJRySB
$C: Interesting. A frog named Heat Index. 
$C: He was having a drink, frogs absorb water through their skin!
$C: I mean what do you do when a giant offers your a pool of water?
$C: That’s one of the most adorable things I’ve ever seen. Love. 
$C: I officially declare this is the highest upvote post I've ever seen.
$C: who would turn down a free bath?
$C: This now the top post in this sub.
Stay cool, froggo.
$C: Don't frogs actually drink through their skin?
$C: Frogs drink by absorbing water through their skin so it did accept your drink of water offer.
$C: He's [drinking](http://allaboutfrogs.org/weird/general/skin.html) :)
$C: this has the most karma points i've ever seen...
$C: Bask in your glorious karma brother! 
$C: da smolist ribet
$C: congrats on top post of all time on this subreddit!
$C: OP has earned karma till next life. 
$C: Hi-ho, this is Kermit the Frog, reporting to you live from the new swimming pool installed by the gate!
$C: Holy crap 228k upvotes. Now that's impressive. 
$C: Does this have the most upvotes ever?? 
$C: There's one sleeping under the weather shield to my propane tank. Just decided to camp out on the intake valve control. Safe from just about everything except people so I just let him stay.
$C: My god I can’t stop watching this , I love this little frog 
$C: A friend of mine had an incredible story of saving a moth last weekend. Good to see the love of nature is in full swing.
$C: This is the most upvoted post I’ve ever seen! 
$C: This is the top post of all time on this sub now! Congrats on making history!
$C: This might be the most upvoted post I've seen in a *long* time 
$C: Top r/aww post of all time. God.
$C: Who knew you could find a pot of reddit gold on a frog post. The reddit leprechauns are feeling generous I supposed, must be because he's green. 
$C: Why does OP only have 14k karma when this post hit 235k
$C: frogs drink through their skin.
$C: I think thats how they drink to be honest. The water gets absorbed into their skin and then they lick it off their face... i think.
$C: And Congrats! It’s the top aww post of all time and it’s not even a day old!
$C: Me when someone offers me just a little bit of attention
$C: Love this. 
$C: i can't tell you how many times i see a pic or a gif here that i fall in love with and save, which is deleted by the time i want to show it to a friend.  please never delete this, and if you do, please send me the link to the OG. :)

i love tree frogs so much (i have two RETFs) and i've been watching this off and on all day.  in fact, today was a pretty shitty day, and every time i needed a little lift, i looped this six or eight times.

i cannot even deal with how adorable this is.
$C: imagine getting one of the most upvoted posts in just a day. wow props to you OP.
$C: Your cute science PSA: Frogs do not drink from their mouths like you do. Most absorb water and gasses directly through a thin layer of skin on their belly and pelvic region called the ‘drink patch.’ (I know because I'm a frog scientist)
$C: How does it feel to have a Top 8 of all time post after only a day?
$C: You should that that frog don't drink water like we do ( using mouth) , they absorb water by their skin using  gland called "drinking patch"...
So ,in a reality he only accepted your cold drink respectfully
$C: I understand. My wife and I often go far out of our way to help frogs, toads, and turtles. Won't anyone else think of them?
$C: This is the highest upvoted r/aww post! Congrats!
$C: I cannot stop watching this over and over!!  SO CUTE!!!!
$C: My heart..
$C: You should post this on r/awww. So cute
$C: The way it just settles into the water. Ugh 
$C: you deserve a special place in heaven sir
$C: holy crap this is now top post on reddit.
$C: Great. He’s gay now.
$C: Wuss Poppin here for the comment
$C: Frogs absorb moisture through their skin rather than drinking it(as do a lot of other amphibians), so it was always going to be both a soak and a drink.
$C: I'm gonna guess that frogs and most other amphibians absorb a lot of water through their skin.
$C: “Could you take me to the nearest pond please?”
$C: Make sure there's no chemicals in that water

Can't have him turning gay
$C: He put his toes in the water, I guess you could say he toad the water...I'll leave now
$C: Got confused for a couple seconds as to why u weren't on fire. G'day from Straya mate
$C: 43 Celsius for (almost) every other country in the world
$C: He ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water than he has in his entire life.
$C: For the rest of the world, 110F is 43.3C
$C: 45 in real units
$C: That’s a nice looking nail
$C: awwww!
$C: I'm impressed with the frog's ability to get into that crevice in the first place
$C: This is so wholesome
$C: Frog bro for the win!
$C: DON'T MIND IF I DO 
$C: Lil spa day
$C: /r/HumansBeingBros 
$C: Awwww, r/frogs would love this little guy too! 
$C: This is so pure wow 
$C: I figured it was your mailman from the title...wanted to see naked mailman. 
$C: Your nails are immaculate.
$C: Congrats on your new pet frog!
$C: “Ah yes, yes, this is nice.”
$C: You’re good people 🐸
$C: This needs more upvotes
$C: This legit made me go awwww
$C: Maybe you’re here in Dallas. It’s been 110+ for too long. I want outta here. 
$C: People like you make the world a better place. :)
$C: I learned in science class, frogs can stand *any* temperature so long as you slowly increase it over time. 
$C: and then the frog pounded 5 bud lights while waiting for mrs frog to come home & playing FIFA
$C: Got that shiver in his little frog balls. 
$C: Wow, what a nice & thoughtful gesture! Thanks!
$C: I want a frog now.
$C: Happy frog good hooman 
$C: OMG this is just the cutest 
$C: Sweet fiddlers frog that’s cute
$C: Awesome!
$C: Been in Tokyo for the past week. Heat index has reached 100-high teens plus us walking EVERYWHERE. I wish I could jump in a cold pool like this little guy and it be socially acceptable.
$C: I’m not sure why but this made me cry :’)
$C: We get very large toads, small orange salamanders, ringneck snakes, garter snakes, and once even a good sized spotted salamander about 8 inches long on my property.  I see them all as beneficial against insects, and they are protected creatures in my yard.  Any specialists in small reptiles and amphibians out there that can tell me what I can do in my yard to help them thrive?
$C: I was going to destroy the planet with nuclear fire until this video was uploaded to my mind. Maybe humans are worth saving after all. Good Human, you are a hero to your people. Rejoice!
$C: Brb looking for frogs
$C: Thank you.
$C: It looks like he’s snuggling into the water to refresh himself. Thank you for being an animal bro!
$C: /r/HumansBeingBros
$C: I’d smash lowkey
$C: "Okay Oscar, you know that thing we practiced 1000 times last week? The camera's rolling, this is your time to shine"
$C: This is the single most adorable thing that I have ever seen.
$C: You’re a good human.  
$C: I love how he just nestles! It's so cute!!
$C: I am watching this over and over!
$C: [deleted]
$C: Are you keeping him?
$C: I like when he/she gets in and pauses then hunkers down for a good soak. He/she totally trusted you or, perhaps said: “F-it. If you’re going end me, do it while I’m soaking my frog-leather self in this cool pool.”
$C: I can't stop watching this.
$C: God has made beautiful creatures. Both human and animals. 
$C: Bless your soul OP
$C: Frogs drink through the pores in their skin so...
$C: "wait, is that water?

yeah, it's water... get in it...

oh, that's nice...

ohhh shiiiiiiitt, that's real nice."
$C: I just imagine him in a British accent saying, "ahhhh that's the ticket"
$C: Arizona summer is a bitch, but Arizona humans are goodbois. 

- Frog
$C: Where does this frog/op live? 
$C: They can drink through their skin if I'm not mistaken. I may have just totally made that shit up....sounds legit tho.
$C: I love how he takes a second to process the situation before saying "fuck it it's too hot, let me cool off in this hooman's water contraption." 
$C: a slimy boy is a happy boy. good work op
$C: u/akiyamareno froggo !!
$C: That's actually how they drink!
$C: that's some Disney princess shit there
$C: I love it!
$C: If I fits I sits
$C: I 110% approve this 
$C: aww that wiggle!
$C: Very nice and caring of you to help the tree frog out on such a hot day 
$C: This is literally the best, it makes me so happy! 
$C: 😭😭😭😭
$C: His FrogLips must have been parched!
$C: Lol reminds me of the time when I found a Frog in my Base Windows During a Illinois storm. Lol, that is a moment I will never forget.
$C: This is the best thing I’ve seen. xoxo
$C: you have a very kind soul
$C: He nestled his little chin on your thumb, how sweet!
$C: Respect 
$C: Amazing 
$C: Humans being bros
$C: In his mind, you are a kind and merciful good.
$C: If that frog fell would it die? Do frogs take fall damage?
$C: r/humansbeingbros 
$C: AWWW YISS!!
$C: I love you for helping him. 
$C: Well he is an amphibian. He needed a full soak. Your an awesome human for helping him. 
$C: Imagine being offered a swimming pool of water
$C: Zen moment of the summer
$C: FootloosePickleJuice, you're awesome.  I love it. 
Nice work.  You're cool (ing), too.
$C: Growing up I would get lots of green tree frogs in the house.  I was always taught to thoroughly wash my hands, rinse all the soap off, and only pick up the frog (to take it outside) with clean, dripping wet hands
$C: Bless you
$C: ok i liv with u now
$C: Would it surprise you if you knew that frogs “drink” through their skin?
$C: He's so tiny that he fully submerged himself into a bottle cap full of water. It's crazy that the bugs he eats are almost the same size as him.
$C: If I fits I sits
$C: He closed his eyes!! 
$C: What a sweet gesture! Keep going man.
$C: Now that's some high quality h2o
$C: Poor think looks dry.  He very much appreciated the water.  Cutest thing I've seen in a long time.  Thank you! 
$C: Omg, it is sooo tiny
$C: My little swimming pool !!🐸🐸
$C: In this summer heat, it was crazy satisfying watching this froggy jump in that little cap of water. Gracias!
$C: I got heaps of frogs around my place, sometimes they come in under the door and it becomes a race against time to catch them before the cat does. Love frogs.


$C: Sweet buddy!!
$C: Instant classic
$C: "For me? Oh thank you! Oh my this is lovely!"
$C: Moisture is the essence of wetness. Wetness is the essence of beauty. 
$C: Don’t they drink through their skin??
$C: Fucking v.reddit man...shit doesn't work
$C: What’s the difference between heat index and temperature?
$C: Frogs are so cool and cute. 
$C: Bless you OP.
$C: Best user name ever
$C: Desperation is really bringing us together 
$C: I love the way he just settles in, and gets comfy!
$C: You’re on your death bed and the doctor says there nothing he can do... 

In comes the frog grown the fuck.
throws a wad of cash in the doctors face and says “ i don’t care what it cost ! .. make this human WELL!”  Life debt paid. 

$C: My nam is frog

Am very smol

Some H2O?

Why thank u human

Full body soak!
$C: Some say my heart grew three sizes today
$C: Dude amphibians drink through their skin 
$C: 100k in 4 hours. Wonder what itll be at when i awake
$C: You can lead a horse to water, but you must bring water to a frog🐸
$C: :D
$C: Funny story. Once when I was young a tree frog fell in the boat with me and my dad and he handed it to me. When I was done with it I threw it in the water and he was like “what the hell why would you do that?” I said “he’s a frog” he said “a TREE frog. Not a WATER frog” and I cried cause I thought I drowned a frog. 
$C: He’s probably drinking through the “drinking patch” located on the belly and and underside of their thighs. I learned this from Tuck Everlasting 
$C: Frogs drink thru their skin... ❤️🐸
$C: r/HumansBeingBros
$C: “Don’t mind if I do”
$C: It is equally as dry here in the Netherlands. Got seperate waterbowls for hedgehogs, insects and cats and i love watching them being used!
$C: That looks like it felt good. Good human
$C: Fox, get this guy off me!
$C: There's something special about the combination of a kind human and an appreciative frog. Didn't know that until now. But definitely special. 
$C: So cute! You should put a small dish of water or something out there for him.
$C: What a cutie
$C: Damn, you’re a real homie!
$C: He’s totally smiling at the end <3
$C: I didn't know I needed a frog in my life.
$C: Frogs actually drink by absorbing water through their skin so he did, in fact, take up your offer.
$C: From a frog lover, thank you for this
$C: Don't worry, Froggy. I'll keep you moist. 
$C: How did you not keep him??? Omg soo cute
$C: Well this just brightened up my day! 
$C: Poor guy
$C: This is so kind ☺️ well done, op
$C: This is a lot more polite than the time I caught a lethargic amphibian in the basement, took it outside while half asleep myself, and put it a little too enthusiastically in the nearby small pond. 

Tried to help, ended up water boarding. :(
$C: Thank you for taking care for that little frog.
$C: "Mjeh"
$C: That often *is* how many reptiles drink, especially desert reptiles. Water on their body will be drawn to the edges of their mouth via the capillary effect.

Think of if you put a paper towel upright in a glass of water. The water will travel up the towel, wetting the portion not in the glass.

This be how some frogs and lizards do.
$C: Definitely gonna need more frogs on this sub
$C: Thank u/footloosepicklejuice friend of frogs
$C: I thought it couldn't get any cuter
$C: The part when he hunkers down 😍😭💖
$C: That's how frogs drink
$C: I love nature and wildlife so much. They always surprise you! He wasn't even scared, he knew you were there to help. What a cute little guy =) 
$C: That was very nice of you!!  anytime i see a frog or toad in the florida heat I always put them on the edge of the nearest puddle or supply of water because a lot of times they get too far away and bake.
$C: 181k upvotes! I never think I seen so many upvotes on a post. 
$C: The face of satisfaction 
$C: Thank you human, very cool
$C: A lot of people say humans as a species should die out, as we are killers and haters, but I disagree.  This video shows what we are; the love we have inside us for everything around us.  If there is even just one person with compassion and the want to help others we have hope and we should survive.
$C: Just realised that this post is the top post of all time. Congratulations OP
$C: The world needs more people like you. 
$C: All hail hypto toad
$C: OMG, the trust of that tiny creature!
She's going to need a MUCH bigger bottle cap. 
$C: That wiggle as he settles into the water just killed me.
$C: Thank you so much for saving that Kekistani warrior. Shadilay, brother!

$C: If I fits, I sits. 
$C: r/HumansBeingBros
$C: The wife hangs these flower baskets on the outside lights at our house every summer. One year, while watering it, I see movement inside, and it turns out a frog decided to make it his/her home. So i cut out the bottom of a cup and filled it with water and placed it nicely inside. The next day, I come out to check on em, and low and behold, he is passed out inside the cup in the water. He stayed around for a good 3 or 4 months before he/she decided to move on.
$C: The way they just shuffled down in the cap a little deeper than when they first got in and just started relaxing was just adorable.
$C: This is the most upvoted thing I’ve ever seen on Reddit, great job!!
$C: I have watched this so many times and I love it
$C: this reminds me of how my dog goes straight for the kiddie pool at the dog park and ignores all the other dogs when its hot out
$C: This post and these comments are so wholesome ☺
$C: Don't they drink through their skin?
$C: Stuff like this makes the struggle to stay vegan worth it.
$C: That's adorable! Made my morning even better! Thank you sir!
$C: Oh my gosh!  Thank you for saving his tiny life!
$C: Great job, frog bro.

$C: RIP his inbox
$C: Okay so when the water warmed up you made sure to refill it with more cold water right?
$C: I'm French and I like it
$C: Frogs can drink through their skin you saved that dude.
$C: Frog: "Aah! What are you doing?? Wait, is that cold wa- oh, hell yes it is! Okay, don't eat me, I'm getting in. Oh, boy, that is, oh, that's heaven. Yeah. I'm just gonna... settle on in here... rest my little head on your thumb a bit, and.... Yes. All is right in this place."
$C: The new champion of r/aww!!!
$C: That little wiggle after he sat in the water... 
$C: Your username kills me....was that a saying you used when you were younger? 
$C: Isn't that still a cold drink for amphibians? 
$C: Frogs actually drink through their skin! So thats how the little guy goes for a drink 😴

They actually drink with their butts.
It's called a seat patch.
$C: Hide a doggie bowl in the flowerbed and you’ll have a friend for life. Just make sure to refill the bowl periodically. 
$C: Hey I know him 
$C: That's a pretty funny sight! :)
First a little bit hesitant, but then it's like... fuck it, too warm to be picky.

Got job on helping this little buddy out! 
$C: You're a good person, OP.

$C: That's awesome!!! 
$C: This was only posted six days ago and it's already the fifth most uovoted post of all time.
$C: Wtf that’s soooo hot. It’s never past 41 degrees where I am from.
$C: When God sends one a miracle and you just marinate in it like
$C: I saw a poor local frog had died crossing the trail trying to get to the water.  I am happy to see you are helping your locals...
$C: Froggo
$C: Why doesn’t this post show at the top of all? It would be the number 1 post
$C: This makes me happy every time I log into Reddit 🙂 
$C: We need a r/wholesomefrogmemes

$C: He could not resist. 
$C: Thank you kind human. 
$C: In a subreddit where 99% of posts are of dogs and cats, the most upvoted post is of a frog. What a charming little green boy :)
$C: You offered that frog *water*? Like from a toilet?
$C: This is the cutest thing I’ve seen all day. Thank you. 
$C: 110°F = 43.33°C
$C: Liar the water would melt if it was 110•
$C: Awww, God Bless your good heart!
$C: Heat index? Is that what they're calling "temperature" where you live?
$C: Awh little frogger boye took a bath.. so cute :’)
$C: For non-Americans that is about 43 Celsius 
$C: Tfw celcius. Very cute dog there though
$C: You. I like you. 
$C: I hope there aren't any chemicals in this water that turn the freaking frogs gay
$C: Everytime I hit play on something marked as video when I'm in office bathroom, I'm afraid something will shout from the video and make me feel embarassed...
$C: r/humansbeingbros
$C: Frogs also drink with their entire body surface.
$C: Froggie : “GET AWAY FROM ME!! Eh wait..let me just..ooh~ that’s just...oh yeah~”
$C: Top post of all time. 
$C: My nem is frog
And wen it hot
Water I want
Can find it not

Hooman say here
Drink from da lid
But I too warm
I sit instead
$C: That's the face kids make when they're peeing in the pool. 
$C: Aw, I'm sure the little fella will be eternally grateful to you for saving his life ☺️ My friends and family always make fun of me because I save bugs from drowning in the pool or I put them outside if they're in the house, but they're denizens of the Earth too, little though they may be! 
$C: Frogs do not drink like we do; they absorb water directly through their skin in an area known as the 'drinking patch' located on their belly and the underside of their thighs. Ps I’m not smart I googled it
$C: I think you may have found a froggo doggo. 
$C: This has got to be like 100 times worse than when a cat sits on your lap and you're not allowed to move anymore
$C: Heat Index? Is this an american thing? 
$C: Bud...
$C: r/humansbeingbros
$C: You are a awesome human!!!!

$C: Aren't they cold blooded
$C: You rock!
$C: It was 110° heat index here too. I didn’t soak any frogs. 
$C: "you and me are best friends now"
Froggo probably

$C: This is the most amazing thing I’ve seen in a long time. What a cool human. 
$C: Cute lil guy 
$C: Uhhhh, thats how frogs drink though 
$C: Look at him jump into the portable air pond :)
$C: My first reaction.. “aww”

Seeing it’s r/aww.. Priceless.

$C: is that a whites tree frog in the wild?
$C: rib-awwyiss-bit.
$C: Thanks I needed this video in my life <3
$C: I love this. He turns around like, “this? for me?”
$C: He owns you now. And he knows it too.
$C: “Thanks man!”
$C: Omg first time ive seen a frog do that so calmly and knowingly. It KNEW you were offering to help it, looked straight up at you and took a chance. This is honestly amazing. And good on you for taking the time out of your day to offer aid to a small critter, clearly it appreciated it. Aaaa this is just so adorable and amazing and ahdjfjkf always makes me wonder what is going through some animals’ heads, like especially for such a tiny frog which are normally skittish.
Speaking of frogs, this just made me think of my own [frog story](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/90cn2u/full_story_in_comments_a_very_cold_tree_frog_i/?st=JJTG05I7&sh=e36dedee) 
$C: Your small kindness made a big difference to that little guy.
$C: Everyday can be Wednesday when you're this kind 
$C: MAH HEART
$C: That's fuckin' adorable.
$C: Thirsty guy
$C: This makes me want to go give that rattlesnake in my backyard some water ❤️
$C: "This is my home now"
$C: Those little tree frogs can make a lotta noise!!
$C: Awwww how kunieee :3
$C: Seeing things like this really makes me love Reddit. 
$C: This made my day
$C: Awwwww on behalf of the little frogger thank you!
$C: Good humans. 
$C: The little butt wiggle really made this even more adorable.
$C: Adorable !!!!
$C: What is "heat index"?

EDIT:  "a quantity expressing the discomfort felt as a result of the combined effects of the temperature and humidity of the air."

Google search. 
$C: Do you know what kind of tree frog he is? Hes really cute, you probably gave him such a comfy bath.
$C: I love how he doubles down and almost goes “ahhhh yes yes this is perfect, thank you”
$C: This is so pure.
$C: So adorable! Both of you!
$C: “I live here now. Get off my property.”
$C: I love the his further nuzzle into the water! 
$C: That's cool as shit
$C: If I remember my highschool Biology correctly, frogs die when their skin loses moisture. 
$C: Texas?
$C: My mum always left a bowl of water out for frogs.
$C: “ok human, now put me in some shade.”
$C: Aww yiss
$C: Love it!

We had to get one of those animal bridges for frogs and ducks to get out of our in ground pool. We had a baby duck go for a cool off with mom and get stuck. Once we got him out we figured it was a good idea. It has also turned into the entrance/exit/sunspot for various lizards. 
$C: He seems too cute to not be poisonous. 
$C: When I was a kid my grandma put my pet frogs in the sun because they looked cold :(
$C: Sitting like a prince on his throne. 
$C: Awwwwww. I get a shit ton of those frogs coming out of my unused pool each year. They’re sooo cute
$C: goes. Must have found you absolutely ribbeting 
$C: Precious. I love this thirsty boi
$C: “I am yours now.”
$C: He decided this human was a friend pretty quickly lol

$C: Thank for this! Made my day!
$C: Great. Now he's gay.
$C: How do I upvote this more than once?
$C: "I am greatful for this, human. My people will hear of your good deeds for I am the Frog King."
$C: Texas?
$C: its spa day my dudes
$C: I want to be able to drink through my skin as well
$C: Saved his little froggie-life

$C: You’re a good dude
$C: Accidental awesome. The best.
$C: Haha pretty cute
$C: Sick frog

$C: Now you may kiss the frog!
$C: that makes more sense.  hes/shes not a dog.  his/her skin has special protective properties so maintaining a hydrated skin is a survival tactic.  
$C: This silly behavior is why I love frogs and toads. They're so chill, and I really feel like they understand humans better than most other creatures- at least when it comes to our intentions with acts of kindness like this.

I've never met a scared or nervous frog/toad.
$C: This made my night. I love seeing my fellow humans helping a more vulnerable species.

$C: That little frog prince purified himself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka.
$C: If I fits, I sits.
$C: That was quite an act of trust.  Also, you must have good water where you live.
$C: My niece has discovered a few little tiny skinks living around a rock wall in her backyard.  She's upset that it is so hot outside so I promised her I'd help her make them a little minipond this weekend so they can "Netflix and chill" (her words...yes we are positive that she has no idea what this means and is just repeating things she's heard on TV.  Yes we lol about this).  So what do?  I was thinking of using this old white dogfood dish the previous tennants left in the garage.  Throw a few rocks in there, fill with water and tuck it into a shady corner of the wall.  Will that be beneficial?  Will they even care?  
$C: That’s how they drink. They drink through their skin.

$C: This wins the Internet.
$C: He looks so happy!!
$C: Lil ribbet needs the wet

$C: This is that cute shit
$C: Cool do you know what species? Looks like either a tiny Hylid or a metamorph hylid.
$C: I can only imagine how fucking hot it would have to be for me to surrender my body to a 700 foot tall giant holding a me sized pool in its claws.
$C: this is the kind of thing that makes me wonder if animals can recognize human intention.

$C: Hurley, you might not want to tell Sawyer you found the tree frog in this time.
$C: Watched it multple times to see him snuggle in the water! 
$C: God this is so wholesome❤️
$C: Now I'm depressed about the frogs that didn't get the luxury of a water bath.
$C: Gud
$C: GOLD
$C: Nicely done. I find these frogs dead all the time in the city. Usually appears like they roasted on pavement. That’d be a bad way to go 
$C: Soup time
$C: I have a serious phobia of frogs, but this was cute as shit.
$C: You are an amazing human 
$C: “Get my balls cold!” - My husband 
$C: Fun fact: r/frogs is a thing that exists, and they would enjoy this.

$C: Weird name for an animal.
$C: imagine a giant alien 1000 times your size and weight approached you with a tub of water, would you just jump in it? 🤔
$C: We must be gods to them. 
$C: Same.
$C: Very cute! When 
we were kids my bro n a cousin n myself, we used to go to a creek that ran thru our small town. We would catch little frogs n 
some other creature n take them to our little clubhouse in our backyard. The guys would dissect them n I guess threw them away. (I was 8 then n didn't understand why they did that) I was excited to be able to hang out with the guys!
$C: This is just the cutest darn thing I've seen
$C: AWWWWWW YISSSS

$C: I wonder how much of our planet's biodiversity will die off due to rich people paying our politicians to ignore climate change. I wonder if it will imperil our own safety. 

I wonder how future generations will judge us.
$C: Rate pepe

$C: Am I the only one who cant stop staring at that piece of hair stuck on him
$C: Frogs are chill

$C: What did you do with him afterwards?
$C: Clip ends before the morsel is popped into the mouth and enjoyed.
$C: "The thousand-meter tall Sky Colossus is offering me a jacuzzi!  
...eh, it's hot #YOLO.  
Ahhh, better."
$C: Loved him in the Budweiser commercials 
$C: Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't frogs absorb water through their skin. So technically hes "drinking ", right?
$C: It's not easy being green
$C: Yes, because frogs drink through their skin. Good thing he knows that sort of thing. Cute little guy, and so nice of you to cool him off! More people should be nice to animals. :)
$C: Jumpo doggo water sit
$C: PROTECT HIM AT ALL COSTS
$C: And as an European person, i thought you"d make steamed food. Damn Führerheits.

$C: Bless your heart!
$C: What kind of frog and where is this?
$C: Hahaha great one 
$C: ELI5: heat index?


  Too lazy and a little drunk. Heard it many times before. Combined heat and humidity? What do?
$C: If I fits I sits 
$C: Wow small frogs 
$C: Very cute

$C: Omg omg omg!!!!! 
$C: Now kiss it and see what appears 
$C: Are you in Texas?

$C: +1 faith in humanity 
$C: That readjustment is absurdly cute.
$C: This is the single greatest frog-related thing I have ever seen.
$C: Did you try kissing it? 
$C: Is the heat index an accurate measure frogs? Wouldn't humid heat be less of a problem for them? I'm not trying to be clever, just genuinely curious.
$C: This is the best thing I’ve seen all week. Ty! 
$C: Should xpost to /r/humansbeingbros
$C: How about some shade along with that sweet life giving nectar.
$C: I Wonder when Lil pool’s gonna start throwing down mad hops. 
$C: This guy knows how to frog.
$C: r/humansbeingbros
$C: r/deepthroat
$C: th...thanks
$C: One of the pro's of being tiny. You don't need much water to get soaked. ;)
$C: You probably saved that little guy's life.  
$C: That is cool, but the chlorine in tap water is bad for amphibians. 

Not as bad as dehydration, though.
$C: What happened after ? Did you take it in and keep it ? I HAVE QUESTIONS ! 
$C: Wtf..... Welcome to the top post of r/aww. Congrats man! And very cute frog lol
$C: I kill flies and ants (if they get inside my house) but go out of my way to save any type of bee where ever they are.... balanced? 
$C: Why would anyone downvote this lmao
$C: Good deed doer.
$C: This is nice quality video, what phone did you use?
$C: Where's Toad?
$C: This made me very happy 
$C: -2°C over here
$C: And they say small plastic caps are better for the environment.
$C: This is one of the cutest “giving an animal water” videos so far. Ahhh so cute

$C: I would want to have kept him!!!
$C: He’s so cute
$C: That little wiggle tho

$C: What a friendly frog 
$C: Such a bro
$C: Such a bro
$C: He fits perfectly! 
$C: Frogs are amazing and I love them. 
$C: Does any1 know the species? Because he is beautiful.
$C: This is too cute .
$C: Smol
$C: Don’t judge him for drinking up the butt.
$C: Gave him a little swimming pool lol
$C: Amphibians, in particular frogs, absorb water and oxygen through their skin. The drinking patch is located under their belly and thighs, which explain the “full body soak” in the gif.
$C: You from OK?
$C: I love these friggin creatures
$C: It is wetnessday my dudes!
$C: That’s how they drink: they absorb it through their skin.
$C: Doing things like this is under appreciated. 
$C: It is hot out there, my dudes.
$C: This summer, I've been seeing an unusual number of dried up, tiny dead frogs on the concrete paths that circuit the park I take my dog to for his walks. So seeing this is timely.   (\^\^)ｂ
$C: Nice so cool frog

$C: Dat boi

$C: Lol...Thats funny
$C: r/humansbeingbros
$C: "Mmm... Yes.... This will do nicely, human."
$C: Now go and tell the frog he has 136k upvotes on reddit.
$C: EVOLUTIONARY CRIME! SELECTION INTERFERENCE! SELECTION INTERFERENCE! 
$C: Why don’t you carry the frog to the nearest body of fresh water and put him in? How does a frog get so far from water anyway?
$C: he’s so skinny 
$C: Nice save
$C: Ribbeting stuff
$C: This baby can take temperatures up to 10,000 degrees!
$C: I found an injured, and probably dying crow on my front steps on July 4th. I knew there was nothing I could do to help the poor fella, so I let him be on the front steps (the alternative would have probably been to forcefully get him off the stairs). I also gave him a bowl of water. 

That crow might not have been able to get off the step, but he sure enjoyed crawling into the water. 

The next morning he was gone. In my mind's narrative, he got better and flew away. In reality, he probably died during the night and got carried away by a raccoon or cat or something.
$C: You in texas?
$C: So cute 
$C: Plot twist: actually a full size frog. 
$C: Kiss the frog!
$C: Don't they drink through their skin?

$C: I can't believe there are frogs that tiny!  It's good of you to offer some water.
$C: Most interesting proposal ever.
$C: OP your fingernail game is on point 🖐👌
$C: Frogs need to keep their skin hydrated so they can breathe, you know.
$C: Two posts beneath this one is an awwducational link about how frogs drink through their skin. So he's just taking you up on your offer of a drink.

$C: Frog bandicoot starting a bonus round 
$C: r/perfectfit
$C: It’s so cute how he gets in it and realizes that he enjoys it so he adjusts his body and gets comfortable
$C: Any frog above ground at 110f here is a crisp in 5 minutes. The concrete is searing hot to touch. 
Is it really 110 there? Birds sit in the shade with wings half open and mouths agape. Most people stay inside. 
$C: Do you have a permit for that?
$C: That’s awesome dude. Thanks for sharing. I’d say it made your day and his

$C: Nice little bath for the cute frog!

I'm somewhat disappointed that it didn't jump straight at the camera though. Almost /r/gifsthatendtoosoon/ material I'd say
$C: This is why we are on this earth.
$C: This is really cool though!
$C: Good human beeing 👍
$C: It's got electrolytes.  It's got what frogs crave.
$C: The reason reddit is awesome!!!

I wondered where he'd been. 
$C: Good people in the world 
$C: Those things are so cool, I used to own a couple of them. I remember when I was young me and a friend looked everyday for the entire summer because we knew you could just go out and find them instead of buying them from the pet store and we found like one silver treefrog late august. was totally worth just buying them for 7 dollars lol

$C: You signed the pact with the Toads from Mount Myoboku

Keep being awesome, friends
$C: Love this xo
$C:  *waterboy voice* "H20!" 
$C: Do animals that don't sweat care what the heat index is? 
$C: V5x2A

$C: "thank you human, ribbit" ...

this makes me feel bad for stepping on his relative (ACCIDENTALLY) the other day.

$C: w
$C: so cute
$C: This is because frogs drink thru their skin, not with their tongues...tongues are for catching bugs.
$C: I really want to know what happened after
$C: That is like a giant offering a kiddie pool to a human to drink from
$C: ....Okay, and then what happened?!
$C: Hi there! I'm a producer for the syndicated talk show, Daily Blast Live. I came across this adorable video and wanted to see if we had permission to use during our show? This would be of our digital and broadcast platforms. Thank you!

$C: u/a_the_cheat
$C: I've done this 
$C: Hello person who sorted by top of all time, whaddup?
$C: They drink through there skin
$C: Frogs drink through their skin though, so not sure what else they were expecting 

&#x200B;
$C: Why did you replace the word “it” with “heat index” 
$C: THIS IS THE COOLEST SHIT EVER AND IF YOU SONT THINK SO YOU CAN JUST FUCK OFF. 
$C: But it was shot **VERTICALLY.**
$C: Its a amphibian, its like saying oohh look the dumb fish is trying to get in the water instead of drinking.
$C: Oh shit waddup!  Is this one of them gay frogs?
$C: He? Whey would you assume it’s “He”? 


This is so sexist, can we hit 69 up votes

$C: Only 188k upvotes?
$C: If i fits i sits. 
No longer just a cat phrase.
$C: are you filipino? I've only ever known that thumbnail shape to be filipino
$C: Wasnt this on reddit litterally two weeks ago?  This is how i learned that frogs absorb water through their skin and thus why he sat in the water.
$C: “Thanks for tha bath Hooman”
$C: 110 degrees?! That’s above boiling D:
$C: How are you not burning alive at the moment? Wood sets on fire at 100 degrees. Oh wait you are using the ancient temparature system that makes no sense
$C: Well no shit that's how frogs take in water
$C: Saw a small lizard on my porch mat yesterday. He scurried away to under my boot I left outside to dry. Lifted the boot and saw it was crushed underneath. I would have liked to give it some water like the frog.
$C: 110 DEGREES ???? How is the water not boiling ?
$C: What the fuck is head index? 
$C: the water was later brought to a boil
$C: In Soviet Russia, frog bathe you.
$C: I actually said "awww."
$C: Bud is wiserah!!! So cool and nice of u can't believe it accepted your offer figured if a giant offered me a Jacuzzi I would be cautious but prolly die in 110° heat
$C: Love that realisation moment. 

Nah I’m good thanks...

$C: How can you be alive at 110.C ????
$C: [removed]
$C: put a heater under the cap.... snack time... (just... ignore this comment i guess?)
$C: 110 Celsius, how are you not burning
$C: Celsius or fake American degree? Because 110° C would be lethal.

$C: dude what's wrong with your hands
$C: 这是什么小动物
$C: So.. Why wasn't the water boiling
$C: 127k uploads how possible? 
$C: Heat index is rather misleading.  You don't mention if it's humid and cooler or hotter and dry out.  
$C: Yeahhhh... Gonna have to call fake on this... You'd probably die in 110 C
$C: Nobody mentioning how clear this video is?! What did you use to shoot this?
$C: Did the frog turn into Prince Charming after the dip?
$C: Fuck gotta go plane mode I have to see this later :(
$C: Frogs drink through their skin
Also, seems legit this repost gets 4 golds when the original gets upvotes
$C: Dont understand most of the comments but I love this little guy!
$C: 5 golds for a repost? 

So I can get a free tank of gas every time I repeat someone?
$C: KILL ALL FROGS
$C: Now heat up the water slowly..
$C: Aborbs water?? Havent looked at all 1.8k comments so pardon me

$C: You should be glad to be alive, this specie is Uber poisonous...
$C: [deleted]
$C: What’s a heat index? 
$C: 110 degrees would almost kill everything. Even 20 degrees is hot. 
$C: That's amazing. Small animals like that seem to disappear when I get near. Somehow they seem to end up between my molars and through the gullet.
$C: when did people get so pretentious theyre calling the temperature the "heat index"?
$C: Temperature, it's called the fucking temperature
$C: WE DID IT!!!!!!
$C: You meant 43 degrees Celsius
$C: Please don’t touch wild animals. You are disturbing the food chain and natural selection. If you can’t take the heat then get out of the fucking oven!!! 
$C: [removed]
$C: Did OP just assumed its gender?
$C: I think he was mostly desperate lol. Frogs don't normally stick around when a human approaches.
$C: Nah he was like "If I get in the bottle cap, the human might kill me.  On the other hand, if I don't get in the bottle cap, the heat will kill me.  I might as well take my chances and be comfy before I die."
$C: He gave the situation the occular assessment. 
$C: To be fair, if a being bigger than me by two orders of magnitude held up a full bathtub to me I would be cautious as well.
$C: "FROG SHOTS!"
$C: I'm saying I did an ocular assessment of the situation, garnered that he was not a security risk and I cleared him for passage.
$C: It’s called an ocular patdown. 
$C: And now he will repay you years later by sitting outside your house, silently reducing any mosquitos that come around your place.
$C: They definitely did I think!! It’s an important lesson for us all to remember to help take care of any animals that we can as we share this planet with them. That one act of kindness from OP very well may saved that frog, like you said!!
$C: Unfortunately, the rest of his species isn't so lucky:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_in_amphibian_populations

"The decline in amphibian populations is an ongoing mass extinction of amphibian species worldwide. Since the 1980s, decreases in amphibian populations, including population crashes and mass localized extinctions, have been observed in locations all over the world."

And yes, if you're first guess is climate change, it's a overriding factor for many of the potential causes of the extinction, not just a separate cause. 
$C: Interesting that OP used the [Heat Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_index) as opposed to the actual temperature which means it could have been moderately warm + very humid, in which case the frog would have been fine with or without the water. It looks like a tree frog of some kind which means it is adapted to do alright without constantly being immersed in water - a humid environment will do. 

So yeah, I doubt it was on the verge of desiccating but it's the thought that counts. I fucking love frogs.
$C: Almost certainly.  Keep it up! 
$C: He may have taken away the Darwin Award from him too. 
$C: He would have croaked
$C: Jjyu
$C: It puts the lotions in the bottle cap. 
$C: Cassandra? Is that you?
$C: Found the whovian
$C: r/unexpecteddoctorwho
$C: Sweet relief 
$C: Yes, Lady Cassandra.  **spritzes**
$C: He *does* have a bit of a nose...
$C: they absorb a lot of water through their skin so i am sure he needed this little bath. 

i feel so bad for much of the wild life when this sort of massive heat hits, so many of them can't escape!

$C: Why *sip* sugar when you can **soak** in it..
$C: Fun fact: water on skin left to evaporate, ie, not sealant, no oil, dehyrates skin after stepping out. This is why you should moisturise straight after a shower

$C: r/unexpectedchrischann
$C: He hunkers right in. 
$C: I didn't notice that until the 2nd time I watched the clip but when I did, an audible "awwww" followed after.
$C: "Yes, it's a mysterious flying saucer of water that showed up in front of me, but it's too hot out here to care."
$C: And the contended eye close. 
$C: Awwwww yiissss
$C: Happy froggy
$C: What about the happy face pouchy puffs?
$C: I didn't think froggos had the capacity to be happy. I was wrong.
$C: Seriously. It’s too cute for words 
$C: seeing that after his slight hesitation before going in is so heartwarming
$C: Yeah... I'm gonna need someone to go ahead and isolate the mini froggo butt wiggle so I can loop it forever 
$C: My lizards do that when they get all comfy, especially when they're getting cozy with their kitties. Yes, the cats love our lizards and vise vera.

$C: moments later; frog bites, hand falls off, person croaks. see what I did there?
$C: I love the way he just settles into the little pool of water. It’s the perfect size. 
$C: We're lucky humans can't drink through their skin. Imagine public swimming pools..
$C: Thanks for the frog fact. You inspired me and I searched for more.

Fact No. 2 Frogs use their eyeballs to swallow. Frogs eat their prey whole and their eyeballs actually sink down into their mouth and push the food down into their throat.

$C: This! Frog bro checked him out before deciding he trusted him. Such a sweetie
$C: Froggo is not doggo but froggo is friendo. 
$C: I learned this when I had to read Tuck Everlasting for school
$C: Above that, frogs do most of their breathing through their skin, and can only do so if their skin is moist. You most likely saved your froggy friend.
$C: Way to go human bro too. 
$C: Exactly this. Little frog actually went for a drink there ;)
$C: So Quiet wasn't so farfetchd after all. 
$C: TIL
$C: Thank you for this info.  The gif is so awesome and adding this info makes it priceless. The two of you deserves gold for this.  
$C: Frog Bros are also dedicated to a higher purpose. They are fighters for truth, justice, and the American Way. 
$C: I was going to say “lil dude can probably drink through his skin.” I was guessing so seeing this as the first comment made me smile. Way to go frog bro! 🐸 
$C: I knew frogs could BREATHE through their skin, but I wasn’t aware that was also how they drank! TIL. 
$C: r/humansbeingbros
$C: I read a story about some dude in India that doesn't have to eat or drink because he has a mutation where he absorbs water through his skin like a frog. Apparently he hasn't ate a meal in more than 10 years or something. Trippy. Tried to find the link but couldn't. The story is out there somewhere, could be bullshit. 
$C: DRINK FROGTUS JUICE, IT'LL QUENCH YA! IT'S THE QUENCHIEST!
$C: Not all frogs are capable of this. Frogs primarily drink like any other vertebrate.
$C: Osmosis FTFW!
$C: Quenched and drenched
$C: Nice Lost Boys Reference!
$C: You literally answered the question I came here to ask, and you were the first post too. I like when things work out like that.
$C: Can we get OP a Frog Bro flair, mods?
$C: It kinda ridiculous that the lower species that drink unfiltered water through their mouth! 
$C: Oh is that why toads are so god dam nasty looking 
$C: THAT IS SO COOL
$C: Why do I see so many dead dried out frogs during the summer. Do they get overheated easily or something?
$C: I believe tree frogs also release toxins back into the water they sit in 
$C: i thought they drink from their ass

Or was that nature documentary i watched when i was 6 lying

It's Friday




My dudes
$C: The way he settles in there all snug lol
$C: I only know this because of Tuck Everlasting.
$C: This needs more upvotes.
$C: Another funny frog fact:

They can't differ between male and female themselves, so it happens that a male attempts to hump another male quite often.

The humped male will then do a special "Whoah I'm a dude bro" scream to signal the mate initiatior to look for a "real female".

$C: That's pretty cool. Sweat glands all over our skin separate humans from the rest, it's cool to see frogs evolve the opposite feature. Not bad for being cold-blooded bastards.

$C: I confirm. I'm French Canadian, from the province of Québec.
$C: TIL! Plus he’s so tiny and squeeeee! How the OP even noticed him! 
$C: Also why it's really important not to touch amphibians with dry hands. You taking the moisture from their skin is a bit like a burning sensation for them.
$C: YesterdayILearned !
$C: Plus frogs can’t breathe if their skin isn’t moist.
$C: *Saving frogs is a hobby*
$C: More frog facts please
$C: I was wondering that. Thanks Science Reddit!
$C: Specifically in a spot located on their belly! They absorb oxygen through their skin, which is why they need to keep moist. He definitely needed some help. 

Some other cool frog facts: 

Frogs push their eyes down to assist in pushing whatever it preys on, down it's throat. This is why frogs 'blink' after catching prey. 

I don't remember the benefits for it, but I'm pretty sure frogs' eardrums are connected to their lungs.

When a Female and Male Darwin Frog reproduce, the eggs are swallowed by the Male and kept in his vocal sack until the baby frogs are able to leave.  

Frogs shed their skin and eat it. 

Although you may find a frog with it's eyes closed, no one is sure if frogs sleep or not.

$C: *Most infuriating frog ever....*
$C: You joke, but when I was a kid we caught a green tree frog in my grandmothers back yard and brought him home in an empty Sprite bottle that we punched holes in, added a little bit of water to, and a big stick that barely fit in the hole.  

That frog chilled out in the bottle for a 9 hour car ride, and when we got home we set up a 20 gallon habitat for him and fed him crickets.  

Had that bastard for like 5 more years, ended up adding another green tree frog shortly after getting him (this one from a pet store), and it was pretty awesome.  I loved it.

$C: Any feminists get offended on that thread?

$C: "I cannot cure your cancer, kind sir, but I can promise you that you will not leave our Earth alone." Snuggles into your bedside water. 
$C: I was 16, with a group of other teens out in the boundary waters of Minnesota for a month. It was an ascent program for bad kids. In the middle of this trek, the leaders split us up for 3 days. We had a bag of food consisting of sweet grains and a few pieces of candy, approximately 800 calories. We had unlimited drinking water, 1 bottle and fluoride tabs. We were given a sheet of plastic and 10 feet of twine. We had to setup our own camps and survive alone for 3 days. The first day was frantic, setting a base, making my shelter, ridding insects and clutter to keep away bugs and things that bite. As dusk arises, so does the anxiety. The wildlife is in full roar, to the point that you can't hear your thoughts over the wild birds singing their songs. As the night progressed, and the temperatures dropped, so did the songs of the birds. As it seemed, suddenly the woods were black, pitch black, and nothing could be heard. You could only hear your own heartbeat. I longed for family, comfort. I feel asleep thinking I'd never wake again. SNAP! I'm sitting up, still, holding my breath. SNAP! My eyes are wide, trying to visualize what's near and might possibly be my demise. SNAP! I jump and grab the thing closest to me, a boot. Great. I'm shaking and hysterical. I want to shit. Snap.. the breaking branches are getting softer, its moving away.  It goes quiet. I have a headlamp, batteries so far gone all I get is a dim glow. I decide to turn it on to check the time on my cheap casio. I'm laying down again and I turn my lamp on. FUCKING FROG IN MY FACE! I screamed like girl in a cheap horror movie. The frog stayed in place. Hes sitting out of the weather in my other boot that was tipped over. This frog came back to my boot for the next 2 nights, and slept in my boot right next to my face.  My protector.

$C: "Hey! It's that frog!"
$C: You are crossing the street while looking at your phone. The frog senses danger and jumps out of a nearby puddle. You are hit by a truck and die instantly. The frog leaves.
$C: You race down the alley. It was stupid, you're smarter than this, but you figured you'd save some money on a cab walking home.

"You can run fa**ot but we're gonna get you!" they yell, echoing off the brick walls, thundering in your ears.

When the first one hit you, you'd sprinted. I mean you work out, you're fit...you thought you could outrun them.

They'd first just wanted money but when they saw the stamp from LockJaw, a well known gay club, that's when their tone got even darker. 

This was a good state. You'd moved here to get away from this shit. How could this be happening to you...

And then you tripped. Face first, skidding, it was only seconds before they surrounded you and started kicking. One hit your ear and it was like the world exploded and everything started ringing. You couldn't see...is this how you're going to die. 

Then one of them startes screaming. "There's something in my eye! Eagh fuck it stabbed my fucking eye!"

You couldn't even see what was happening, just a small green flash in the dark. Zipping back and forth, the attackers went down one by one. It wasn't even thirty seconds before the alley was silent except for the gurgles of choked breathing.

You laid there for you're not sure how long...it felt like hours but was probably only minutes. When you got up your attackers we're sprawled around you. Blood pooled by their throats, just small red lines encircleing their necks ... like a small knife.

You turned to look, trying to figure out who had saved you. In the alley entrance there was a shadow. Bathed in a glow from the incandescent street lamps there was just...a small frog. 

You remember...saving a small frog the other day. Offering it some water.

A passing car baths the alley in light and pushes the shadow up on the wall. Instead of a frog though you see a man, tall broad holding a narrow sword like you'd expect in fencing. 

You walk up...gently picking up the frog looking at it. It's just a frog....a cute frog but really just a frog.
Still unsure what happened you hold it up, peering closer. It leaps and you feel in mild disgust despite what's happened as it's skin brushes your lips....

There's a flash...

And a man stands before you. You're frozen in confusion as he smiles.

$C: The Story of the Fisher King.

  The fool, not seeing a King close to death, only saw a man suffering.  "what ails you friend?" Asked The Fool. "I am thirsty" replied The King. "I need a drink of water." So the Fool reached for cup sitting on the bedstand, filled it with water and gave it to the King. The King drank and as he did he felt his wound heal and his strength return. In his hands was The Holy Grail. The King exclaimed "How could you, a simple Fool find what my bravest and wisest could not?"  The Fool shrugged, not knowing the answer. "All I knew," he said. "was that you were thirsty."

We can all do something to help make the world a better place. Even if it's as simple as pushing in a chair someone left pulled out or being the one who shows understanding in a long queue or puts a single item that was knocked down in a store back on the shelf.

$C: When my girlfriend goes on walks on a hot day or just after it rains, she stops to scoop worms up off the pavement and then places them into the grass. She even covers them with leaves so birds don’t see them.

$C: Happy cake day!
$C: Isn't this r/tinyanimalsonfingers
$C: I'm not sure about this. Hitler and Goering really liked animal welfare and would send animal abusers to concentration camps. Also everyone else they didn't like.

No thanks.

Frogs are annoying.

Go google some youtube frog noise.  Then listen to it for an hour.  Then go find a rock and kill some frogs.
$C: As long as the frog is here legally.

Do I need to put /s. I really don't know anymore 
$C: Compassion for small cute things is just a sign of anything. 

You could kill in the name of compassion no problem. 
$C: Unless OP has “Only4Karma” tattooed on their forehead.
$C: How does this make the world a better place? Did they solve world hunger or something? That's a bit of a stretch.
$C: But if you do this for pigs, you get [charged by the police](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/04/canada-anita-krajnc-pigs-water-case-dismissed). Go figure.
$C: [There are giant ones too](https://taronga.org.au/animal/white-lipped-tree-frog).
$C: My local zoo has a Herpaquarium and inside they have some poison dart frogs. They're super adorable. 
$C: If you go outside just after a rain in certain places in the spring (in the low canopy of a magnolia is where I used to do my looking), you can see all kinds of teeny tiny baby frogs!
$C: I seen tree frogs this morning.

I seen four the other day.

I would just make sure you get some spring water from either the grocery store or pet store. That way your little friend can have chem-free water! Maybe you already do, but I figured I'd put that out there.

$C: They “drink” through their skin :)
$C: TIL
$C: Sun drools.
$C: Exactly, you can literally watch the frogs thought process and see how quickly it chooses water over big creature


$C: “Ahhh, that’s what my green needed” reminded me of John Mulaney’s story about the old rich guy. “One feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet!”

$C: r/amphibianfacts
$C: I guess it could potentially affect them because humidity usually has an inverse relationship with temperature fluctuations doesn’t it?
$C: Aww. We have geckos all over my porch! Thanks for the awesome idea to help them. They keep coming inside my house to cool off and my indoor only cats keep leaving their gnawed on corpses around. Hopefully they will go for the water instead.
$C: I think you are correct in your assessment of dehydration lol.
$C: Heh, the mom needs a sense of humor. You were just trying to save an animal and it was clearly an honest mistake.
$C: Just happened to be standing in the right place at the right time drinking a bottle of water. To be honest I kind of expected maybe he’d use his tongue to lap up some water. I didn’t realize they drink through their skin until someone posted that. 
$C: There really aren't that many bottle cap sizes.
$C: He’s not drinking, he’s breathing.

$C: Omo ! Sho cute
$C: REVLON
$C: they do. they have drinking patches under their stomachs.
$C: Heat index is what the temp feels like combined with humidity. So the actual temperature could be like 90 but with humidity it feels like 110.
$C: This is why i love reddit, every day i learn something new.

$C: Just outside Tulsa, OK actually. 
$C: Next thing you know he'll want just a little lick.  Before you know it you wake up down by the creek face down in the mud after a night of frog licking.

Today when I woke up this post was the first one I saw and it had like 150k updoots. Usually I never sort post comments, but today I thought why not. Your comment was the first one I saw, and it was from Idiocracy. Man.

No1 will probably read this but yeah, just had to write it off my mind.
$C: Brawndo!
$C: Because Reddit is very broken. Happens all the time.
$C: I ask my self the same question when I see a post with thousands of likes.
$C: What i was thinking!
$C: Nah not enough bright colors on it... this is just a standard green tree frog 
$C: No, the heat index is the temperature your body feels when the actual air temperature combines with the humidity in the area.
$C: they have those sticky feets!  of course they climb walls!
$C: Yeah, I think some do, and aren’t there also lizards who drink with their feet? 
$C: yes, they do.  frogger was having a sip and cooling off simultaneously.

and probably peeing to boot.  this is why if you have pet frogs, you change their water daily.  :)
$C: Big facts 😤👌

$C: Wood doesn't burn at 100 degrees with any system. It's around 450F, 232C, or 505 kelvin, give or take a bit.
$C: Imagine being this guy

All day

All the time
$C: OP is referencing the temp/heat index in fahrenheit, not celsius.  Water boils at 212° F (100°C).
$C: Heat?!
$C: Imagine you were in a middle of a desert with no water around you at all. I would personally take my chances with the giant since I'd be dying of dehydration and heatstroke anyway if I refused his offer. At least I'd be comfortable if he decided to kill me
$C: That’s interesting since it only happened two weeks ago

$C: Terrible comments will have downvotes. If you don’t want downvotes don’t ask to “ignore” but think more critical on what is actually funny in what situations
$C: If OP lives in the U.S. or any other country that doesn't normally use Celsius, they're referring to 110º Fahrenheit.
$C: then i guess you answered your own question now didn't you?
$C: Kelvin or fake Celsius degree? Because 110°K would be lethal.

$C: IDK, I had a toad stalking me for about a week a few years ago. Little bastard would sit on my deck and stare into the house, night after night. It would even hop towards me in a rather menacing fashion if I was sitting out there. 
$C: henmen
$C: He was just worried because of all those stories about humans putting chemicals in the water to make the frogs gay
$C: Given his brain is probably smaller than the a grain of rice I'd say it was more "BIG THING.   RUN?.   NO, WATER.   HOT.  WATER.  MOVE LEGS."  
$C: Patted him down 
$C: Silently my ass. The tree frogs around me lose their minds for 2 days everytime it rains. Those little bastards are loud when it's sexytime.

Better than cicadas though.

Edit: Of course my highest rated comment ever is about frog sex...
$C: Whilst partially true, I would challenge you on the 'silent' part.

We let our pool go green and now frogs and plants live in it.

It is VERY noisy.
$C: One summer I relocated about a hundred tree frogs from a pool before my neighbor shocked them to death and i swear for years after a little tree frog would be on my door handle every night when I came home. 
$C: Mosquitoes have virtually zero nutritional content. They're almost entirely composed of evil dust. It's part of a defense mechanism against predation - offer absolutely no food to your predators whatsoever.

I'm not even kidding. Many species of spiders recognise that it takes more energy to eat a mosquito than it's actually worth, so they cut the mosquitoes out of their webs and let them fall to the ground. Nobody likes those things, and they're generally accepted by the scientific community as a species that could go extinct tomorrow, and nobody would be worse off.
$C: Love this about frogs. Especially living in humid Florida. I rarely ever get bit around my house thanks to my moist bois
$C: Always love a wholesome story coming full circle!
$C: living in Texas i'd pay a good amount for mosquito reduction so that effort is worth even a 1 percent reduction
$C: He could be maitreya, the future Light Buddha
$C: I got like 4 nearby and I treaty them like royalty
$C: That's a children's book just waiting to be written.
$C: "reducing" ...
$C: Wait so can I buy a small population of frogs to combat my mosquito problem?
$C: It's like the plot of "ghost dog: way of the samurai" but with less samurai and more frogs
$C: And, if they released them back in the garden in the background, they'll help by (maybe) eating some of the pest-insects.

Frogs can be very beneficial to a garden.
$C: >  It’s an important lesson for us all to remember to help take care of any animals that we can as we share this planet with them

Or not idiotically disturb the course of nature because we project our own needs and desires on animals? If everyone did this sort of shit, it could disturb the ecosystem.

$C: Humans are so incredibly cute! Seeing a random little creature in the wild, surmising that he must be suffering in the heat because the human also doesn't like the heat, deciding to do something to ease his suffering. Filming it to preserve the moment because it makes the human happy to see the creature happy. Posting it online to share the happiness with other humans.

*And all these other humans are extra happy because the creature appeared to be super happy about being in the cap water*

Like, how extra are we??? So ridiculous. So cute

$C: Public chlorine poisoning centers 
$C: You can actually absorb for example alcohol through your skin, it is however, very dangerous to take booze-baths since you may very quickly overdose without knowing it
$C: Quiet!
$C: We kind of can. Go get some nicotine suspended in Propylene Glycol on your skin... You will wake up in the ER or not at all.
$C: I bet if I really wanted to I could drink through my skin. 
$C: One swimming pool of coke please
$C: Imagine bars
$C: I knew a guy who claimed to have gone swimming up in a water tower after he climbed it. 
$C: I'm not going to, urinesane
$C: Humans can. Well kind of. Water and things like salt which are in the water still get through you skin and enter your body.

If you would take a bath in ethanol, depending on for how long, you either get drunk or die due to alcohol poisoning.
$C: Butt chugging is kind of like drinking through your skin
$C: Ew
$C: We can and do drink through our skin, get some cotton wool and soak it in vodka, place vodka wool in your armpits, rinse and repeat until desired affect is achieved.
$C: I mean... Steve-o showed us all wecan drink through our butt. 
$C: How about the gay bath spa?
$C: Plot twist: the frog had to pee
$C: You uh. Your not supposed to drink that stuff? brb

$C: Milkshakes would be a real hassle.
$C: "Hey guys let's build public water pools and get in them with strangers so that we can drink each others feces and urine."
$C: Bearded dragons drink from their combo ass/urethra (cloaca). They also love to poop while in the water. Priorities.
$C: Golden showers got way more gross.
$C: We’d be drinking piss for days lol 

Technically your skin does absorb what chemicals it comes in contact with but a moot point 
$C: Too bad frogs have to put up w all the bs we dump in the water

$C: ... My sister once said that we could. That her kids didn't need to drink that much since they were soaking in a small pool all day.

(Doesn't mean she didn't give them enough drinks, there was no dehydration. Just a bit of reminder that she failed biology..)
$C: This is why most amphibians are endangered. Those super populated and heavily chlorinated pools would be a death sentence. 
$C: This is one of my fears is public restrooms and public pools. They are one in the same to me.
$C: Gross
$C: Gross...
$C: Imagine hugs.
$C: I just imagine Quiet from MGS V
$C: Well, we do, in a way. Our skin does that osmosis thing pretty efficiently. Probably more efficiently than we give it credit for, and therefor get a little half-hazard about what we put on our skin. 
$C: I coach swimming and the number of times I have to tell the kids not to drink the pool water.
$C: Does none of it diffuse through somehow?
$C: Imagine sweating. Ugh. 
$C: Technically we can. Well from certain areas of skin. Have a google for alcohol poisoning from vodka tampons! Alcohol being absorbed straight into the body! 
$C: "If the river was whiskey, I'd be a diving duck."

$C: More urine makes everything better. 
$C: Or toilet seats. 
$C: Actually humans do drink through their skin. The amoun isn't much though.
$C: All that sweat and grime
and baby feces too
All of them combine
To make neighborhood stew
$C: Pour up. Drank.
$C: Golden showers might see a resurgence
$C: I knew a woman who breathes through her skin. She didn't talk much but she loved taking outdoor showers. 
$C: I clean pools for a living and they're  full of dead frogs all the time :(
$C: We can though. It's special skin that's only in a few spots, but you can absorb liquids into your skin.

That said, your intestines are one of these types of skin.
$C: Gee thanks 
$C: But you breath through skin. So if you stay in water for ling time time or cover yourself with something you will eventually suffocate.
$C: I went to concert
$C: We wouldn't pee in them. That's sure. And well. Id like to think the pores are also a waterfilter

$C: > Here in Washington State, we have the tailed frog, which is actually the only frog that has an external sex organ and only the males have these misnamed ‘tails.’
$C: It's more just that their whole head compresses to swallow things, I think. Salamanders and other amphibians do the same.
$C: Another funny frog fact: 

They can't differ between male and female themselves, so it happens that a male attempts to hump another male quite often. 

The humped male will then do a special "Whoah I'm a dude bro" scream to signal the mate initiatior to look for a "real female".

$C: > Their eardrum works like a regular eardrum with one very special adaptation…it is actually connected to their lungs... This allows frogs to make really loud sounds without hurting their own eardrums!

I think my neighbours have this same adaption.
$C: That's really interesting! I always noticed my frog doing this when he swallowed but i never realized why he was doing it. 
$C: ... I want magic eyeballs to do this so I can eat more 
$C: So dining out with frogs sounds REALLY off-putting. 
$C: Can confirm. Get weird looks at public restaurants.
$C: They also use the eyeballs to do a wee bit of mastication.
$C: I legit thought this was a joke until reading your link.  Ha.
$C: I thought you were fibbing so I took a look. Wow I never knew, and there's a lot of good information there. Thanks for sharing! 
$C: Other people are freaking out. But what I've learned is that Frogs are very space efficient.
$C: 1 frog 1 drinking cup
$C: Came here to ask this
$C: Came here to croak about it
$C: Thank you r/evanstravers, very cool!
$C: Type*
$C: /r/whyweretheyfilming
$C: Frogs primarily breathe through their nares like reptiles and mammals do, though by a process called buccal pumping. They are secondarily able to obtain oxygen when atmospheric oxygen is not present by absorbing it through their skin. This is much less efficient than their lungs and is not a permanent option, especially for larger species.
$C: TIL
$C: They supplement their intake of oxygen and water in this way. They primarily drink through their mouths, and breathe through their noses.
$C: “Awww yissss”
$C: How long did he soak?
$C: "ribbaaaaahhhhh"
$C: You should set him up with a little like...froggy umbrella near a flower, and a lot of froggy water. and some froggy flies 
$C: This is so sweet, can we get a bigger lid so I can move in too? 
$C: They breathe partially through their skin, and that can only happen if it's still moist. They do got lungs though...

So it was more like "uuuugh oxygen huff huff"
$C: How nice of you to help a tiny animal!
$C: That's exactly how I felt when I saw the little guy dipped right in
$C: That’s one way a frog drinks. 
$C: It’s how they drink, through their skin
$C: Sure. But why are you piggybacking off of /u/Catrionthecat with this? This has nothing to do with what his comment said.
$C: Stop licking the toad

$C: >Unknown to you, the frog pledges a life debt to you. In your darkest hour, the frog arrives.

There's a Tlingit (PNW natives) story about how the guy who discovered the gold that kicked off the Klondike Gold Rush (Skookum Jim) saved a frog that was struggling to climb out of some water. After he saved the frog, he had a dream where the frog showed him the mountain where he was going to find his 'luck.'

The next day, he went out with his buddy, got pretty far from home, and the day after that he recognized the mountain that the frog showed him and found a shitload of gold there.

There's a bunch of versions of this story, but [here's one of them](https://skagwaynews.com/2016/08/18/klondike-gold-discovery-came-in-a-dream-tlingit-storyteller/).

Also, if you hate Donald Trump, just know his family got rich off of the Klondike Gold Rush. So it's technically all a frog's fault.

$C: This makes me feel good. Recently my son received one of those butterfly kits, where you grow caterpillars and they hatch into butterflies. Well all of them pupated, except one chrysalis fell to the bottom of the cup, then when I transferred them my daughter got just overwhelmed with excitement and grabbed the habitat, and the wonky chrysalis got jostled around a bit too much.


When they hatched, one of the butterflies was...special. I called him buttertard strugglefly. He had one totally crinkled wing, a crooked foot, and an eye that wasn’t QUITE right. Couldn’t walk super well but was able to crawl a bit, and definitely couldn’t fly. So when we released them I was like, “fuck. I can’t just leave this special needs butterfly out here to die...”


So I brought him inside, and for TWO WEEK I kept that damn thing alive. I made him a wee perch to compensate for his wobbly leg, and carefully hand fucking fed him fresh cherries every day (couldn’t leave them in there because he would get stuck and flip over on his back and uselessly flail until I righted him.) so I’d carefully put the cherry in front of him, use a toothpick to help him unroll his probiscus, and place it in the cherry juice so he could eat.


I felt SO SILLY. But I also felt really bad like, it’s just seemed awful not to take care of him. After two weeks, which is about the adult life span of this particular breed, he started to deteriorated — literally — a wing fell off, his antennae drooped, he didn’t seem to eat anymore — so I looked it up and found that people who routinely raise monarch butterflies (this was a different species but I imagined it still held true) would place diseased or struggling butterflies in the freezer as a hopefully humane way of euthanization.



Y’all, I cried. Over. That. Butterfly!

$C: I'm up in Montreal, around my parents place in the country where I grew up you can sit there on humid evenings in the summer and literally call them out on your phone, just grab a youtube sound clip of a greys tree frog. Thats typically the species we'll see up here in the north as far as tree frogs go. 

EDIT:
Something like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bzotS1ow0Q
Now forewarning, you can't just go out there on any hot night and expect to get a response. But on evenings when ya hear them calling a bit, start playing the track on your phone pretty loudly - with breaks here or there and you hear get a call back or two. Do that a few times and you can literally hone in on their location. 
$C: > I always assumed they were tropical, I didn't think they live up here.

$C: I miss the post rains worm rescue missions 
$C: It's unfortunate to see someone say this. It's like, when did being kind start not being just expected behavior?
$C: They tend to go hand in hand
$C: This is at least the second time in the same thread you have posted this link. The case was dismissed; it says so in the very article you linked. You can be charged for a lot of reasons, but convictions are what prove whether you are guilty. Yes, it's a pain in the ass to go to court, and doing so from feeding water to pigs seems absurd, but she was also told by the driver to stop and yet continued to ignore him, which is why it ended up going legal.

Maybe not the best example, and this can depend on specific details of the situation, but if some random stranger came up to my dog and I with water and started insisting my dog drink it, at the very least I would be suspicious, and their persistence may increase my mistrust of them to the point where I would refuse to let my dog drink their water, and depending on the interaction, reporting that person to the police is certainly a possibility.

Now in the pig case, I suspect the driver informed the police because of the potentially compromised condition of the pigs, not necessarily that he cares about the pigs themselves, but something like that could get him fired for not reporting due to the possibility of the insistent person having malicious intent (e.g. contaminated/poisoned water). Judging by your comment history, I suspect your interest in veganism is why you are so passionate about this subject, but that also appears to be a personal bias that's preventing you from seeing the whole picture here.

$C: That's a sweet thought, but it isn't how taxonomy works.
$C: Your pun made me croak
$C: Don’t do it. Just don’t. I don’t want the feelings!
$C: Brb, finding shark
$C: Kinda like a small, swimmy toader.
$C: Green doggo
$C: The 'RIP' posts on there are so sad.
$C: Cute sub
$C: Yeah. They just don’t feel the heat index. A hot, humid day will have a high heat index. Unless an animal sweats to regulate body temp they don’t perceive humidity to make it feel hotter than it is. They only feel the air temp. 
$C: Made you look
$C: Go on.
$C: I don’t quite follow. You’re saying the dew point decreases as air temp increases and vice versa? I don’t know if they’re correlated.  
I just wanted to point out the frog doesn’t feel the heat index, only the air temperature. 
$C: Felt awful for the guy. This Texas heat is ruining everything 
$C: She looked so mean, she just stood on her porch staring at me and when I explained she went “Alright. Ok. Yep. Bye.” really coldly. I don’t understand people who are rude to strangers. Ah well !!
$C: Looks like a copes gray tree frog! Are you from the states?? I’ve encountered these numerous times in the wild and owned a couple throughout the years from pet stores. Such cute little bros & sisters!
$C: I don’t generally get my facts while having butt sex in Europe. Thanks anyway! ;)
$C: No u
$C: I had the same thought. We will get through this one, guys. Stay cool! Find a swimmin' hole!
$C: Hello fellow Sooner! I'm in OKC and was wondering if you too were in OK. Thanks to the "air you can wear", it's still in the 90s at 2am here!
$C: I’ve watche it 3 times now. Really cute. 
$C: I love democracy.
$C: 3rd highest post of all time
$C: Oh shit! This ones got a chance then!
$C: i just checked your post history.  apparently you have made a habit of saving lil animal boos!

you for president, 2020!
$C: you're a good person, OP.  it did indeed bring me joy, and i appreciate the positive wishes! i hope you have a wonderful weekend!
$C: Well they were number 8 at the time, so in case they got even more upvotes I would be as accurate as possible, was my thinking.
$C: Yeah, it's called marriage. 
$C: r/woooosh ?
$C: He's talking about 110 degrees. Most of the earth uses celsius, so it's confusing as to why you'd not say fahrenheit
$C: Celsius 
$C: Sure, if you live in Mercury.

$C: Welcome to Reddit.  I upvote you.

$C: Hay man what did you do with him afterwards
$C: For the internet this is a really weird reaction... Umm... Unless you watch this on a phone with the same aspect ratio, you get black bars on the sides.

$C: i know

$C: yes. it would be a waste looks tasty frog.
$C: Ya like seriously. Is everyone in this vid dead? Then I think you know what it is.
$C: Yes
$C: It'd actually just be 110K, not 110°K. The unit is Kelvin, not degrees Kelvin.
$C: ✓
$C: [deleted]
$C: rly makes u think 🤔
$C: Superior? LOL!
$C: I’m not rich or French.
$C: So why not called it the temp rather than heat index lol? Never heard anyone say “my god, the heat index is high today” only “my god it’s warm/hot today”
$C: I know. Im just messing with people. And also people getting triggered and downvoting xd.
$C: and what are the units of this?
$C: hell if i know i just looked it up
$C: Well there ya go. Now I look like an idiot. 
$C: Knew a cane toad once that would do that. He was such an ass-hole, no idea what made him that aggressive but if you got to close he would attach your feet, the dog, shadows. He was the best grumpy animal I ever knew.
$C: I'd like to see how a frog hops menacingly 
$C: He was already gay, nothing to be worried about. 
$C: Gotta make those freaking frogs gay

$C: With his eyes!
$C: I find the sound of cicadas relaxing, and I hate bugs. 
$C: I actually really love the sound of cicadas. 
$C: One of the things I miss the most about living in the Midwest is the way spring peepers just take the fuck over once the spring rains kick in. So relaxing sitting next to a campfire and listening to a chorus of tiny frogs screaming “FUCK ME!! FUCK ME PLEASE!!”
$C: Don't lie. If you could get laid by repeatedly screaming into the night you'd do it 
$C: We have the frogs that sound like sheep outside. 
$C: But cicadas are awesome... So relaxing.
$C: Fuck cicadas, especially the one that landed on my helmet's chin strap while I standing in front of an airplane.  I hope it was one of the charred up carcasses that ran into the engines exhaust.
$C: I love the sound of cicadas and frogs. Though, I wouldn't want to live in an area where the latter is an invasive species, that would be loud...
$C: I love the cicadas song! 
$C: Sexytime
$C: I like the sound of tree frogs. I used to live at my uncle's house that basically had a small fenced-in forest in his backyard, it was awesome, and sitting out on the deck listening to the tree frogs all night was super relaxing. 
$C: Eh who isn’t loud during sexy time
$C: You can actually hear an american tree frog croak from a mile away on a still night. 
$C: Had my first experience with cicadas this past June in Houston. 

Worst thing ever. 
$C: yes the tiny green American tree frog is the second or perhaps the third loudest frog in the world if I'm not mistaken I read somewhere where they hit either a hundred or a hundred and five DB I do know this they are magnificent creatures
$C: Frogs have been dying off like bees so hooray frogs!
$C: Ugh. I hate cicadas. Especially when they decide to chill by your window. 
$C: The sound of frogs and bugs replaces my fan when I hear it. Such good sleep. 
$C: Can confirm, sauce, just been to Rome.
$C: I live in Houston, and after Harvey it sounded like a rainforest outside; they were so loud and there were so many, I have never heard anything like it! 
$C: He can be as loud as he wants as long as he's taking care of the skeeters, as far as I'm concerned. But I also like cicadas so who knows 
$C: I mean if you could only have sex when it rains, wouldn't you be screaming in delight? Lmao 
$C: > Silently my ass.  
  
I farted too
$C: RIP Tree frog that Sawyer killed in the show LOST.
$C: I love that sound!
$C: Tree frogs are very relaxing imo
$C: How can someone not enjoy the songs of frogs and cicadas? I don’t think I could live somewhere that didn’t have those beautiful summer afternoon/evening serenades. But maybe I’m just too much of a southern boy. 
$C: Cringe edit lol, are people not self aware
$C: You're not kidding.  We got one of these little guys in a head of lettuce from the grocery store (I think same species from the looks of him) and ... yes.  So.  Loud.  
$C: Right, at least frogs don't dive at your head when you go outside.  
$C: Have you saved any of their lives derawin07? Maybe that's why they are yelling at you. Get some caps of water and get out there!
$C: I am curious,  do you have a mosquito problem?
$C: Why would you want your pool green?
$C: Goddammit animals are amazing.
$C: Well I learned something new today. Thank you. 
$C: It's all about the dragon flies.    


$C: Why not try? What do you have to lose (except for money and time)?
$C: Well, it was on a building, so it was already an unnatural situation to begin with. I'm glad that little guy was saved ☺
$C: OP is part of nature, so what he did is cool, right?
$C: We already destroyed and disturbed the course of nature with that big ass house in middle of his ancestral homeland.

$C: I am going to Egypt
$C: Hit enter twice.
$C: Weeping angels. All my nope.
$C: They move when you aren’t looking at them which means yes, they move when you blink and in darkness 
$C: Blink is one of my favorite episodes.
$C: If you liked the creepyness of those, try Water on Mars and ermm... The library? Man that dumb girls last words after they get her... "I.. I love, I love, i..ice cream... Ice cream" " shut it off!"
$C: The weeping angles they are called. They turn into stone when you look at them. If you get caught by them they zap you back in time and feed off the residual energy (its fucking scifi. I know it makes no sense). One of the companions died this way. They got trapped in a time that the doctor couldn't go get them in. So they lived out the rest of their lives in the past. The angles are one of the greatest villians i have ever seen in any series in my opinion.
$C: Those are two staples of the series. I don't watch them much either but my ex did. Lotsa people talk about the Weeping Angels
$C: Same here. I've only watched a few episodes, and that is the only one that I remember. 
$C: Weeping Angels. Basically, they can only move when no living being is looking at them (including each other).
$C: If you enjoyed what you saw I HIGHLY recommend finding a way to watch the Dr. Who revival series. It isn't the most consistent show ever (and the 1st season takes a bit to get going) but man when that show is at it's best it is some of the best TV around IMO.
$C: if you want another great episode and dont mind spoilers check out heaven sent s09e11 . its hands down my favorite episode its phenomenal.
$C: Blink
$C: Doctor Who fan, like a more British version of a Trekkie
$C: its bigger on the inside
$C: I had no idea it existed either. but you're welcome
$C: Because much like Overwatch, Dr Who's fandom is so invasive it's never unexpected.
$C: *Waves hands mysteriously*

Because Doctor Who is and always has been a horrible franchise oooOooOOOOoooOOoo
$C: Close, but no cigar.
$C: I haven't thought about this song in *years*

Happy Friday Boys and Girls. 
$C: That head tilt and side eye was fucking adorable.  You could almost hear his thoughts -- "Ahhh fuck it, I'm turning into a green raisin. Need water."
$C: I really like the idea of humans being described in the 3rd person like this. 
$C: This made my day, never thought about it that way
$C: Someone please gild this faith in humanity
$C: Meanwhile I ran over one with a lawnmower and cried into the grass. It makes me feel physically sick if I think about it. 
$C: Sincere thanks for standing well apart from the usual choir of "humans are a blight! We deserve nothing!"-self flagellation we tend to get on reddit.


$C: And then we slaughter billions of animals on a yearly basis. How cute we humans are!
$C: Now, if we could treat all animals this way. ;(
$C: Kinda sounds like you're going out of your way to convince everyone you're human..
$C: Then you start thinking about the fact that 43% of all amphibians are threatened with extinction.
$C: This comment made me smile, thanks. Have an updoot. :)
$C: It really is happiness all around ☺️
$C: HA HA HA YES US HUMANS ARE CUTE. THANK YOU FOR NOTICING FELLOW HUMAN.

$C: Could you imagine a vat of vodka? Wouldn’t know which is which till it was too late
$C: In the Big rock candy mountain
$C: Can't alcohol absorb through skin? I feel like I read that somewhere

$C: Now open your mind and then listen me, Kendrick.
$C: Didn’t Houdini almost die doing something like this?
$C: My uncle drowned in a vat of Scotch whisky. It took four hours, but he fought his rescuers off bravely.
$C: We may not be able to drink water through skin but we can most definitely do that with alcohol though. Don’t recommend it though I can certainly guarantee your death 
$C: I used to do drugs.  I still do, but I used to too

edit: Mitch, love u man RIP
$C: Pour a bottle of vodka in a hot tub, you will get smashed quickly.  


edit: Nvm, did some research and It doesn't work... I must have already been hammered.
$C: Apparently it only takes half a bottle of wine to kill you if you do an enema. So that's always an option.
$C: Define vat. 
$C: 1 drum of grape jelly please. 
$C: Oh wow. I actually feel like alcohol would have more restrictions on it. You could get people drunk by accidentally spilling it on them.
$C: 😍
$C: And you’re dead.
$C: Alcohol is absorbed through the skin....
$C: 1. you can enema whisky, it works but you might die
$C: People would get too drunk and pass out in there
$C: My mannnn
$C: VAT69
$C: Is an [aquarium](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--JSselINa--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,q_80,w_1200/18lqfsw1av7cbjpg.jpg) enough? 
$C: A finger of rye would mean something completely different and yet exactly the same.
$C: Wouldn't you die of intoxication though? 
$C: With a side of dingleberries
$C: Pisskey.
$C: “*Man dies today at distillery after falling into vat of whisky. He succumb to alcohol poisoning within minutes, his last request was some Taco Bell and water.”*  
$C: No but think how easy it would be to drink at work. Just soak a cloth or something in alcohol then tape it anywhere on your body.
$C: Want some urine on it too? It comes free when you order the whiskey.
$C: One bathtub full of lsd please.
$C: indeed
$C: Hot tub bars would be a thing 
$C: Owwwwww
$C: I vaguely remember one of those science shows trying that. It could have been Mythbusters or Brainiac. They filled a bath tub with beer or something and tried to get drunk if I remember correctly. It didn't work.

Edit: Oh it was Brainiac. And it worked. Wow. 
$C: I read this in Bender’s voice

$C: I met a group of foreseeable felons in this program. These kids were fortunate enough to have rich parents. They could have gone to jail or be sent out in this program. One of the kids in my group was a child of the CEO of Seattles Best Coffee.  I learned a lot in this adventure. I learned of a lot of bad things from the kids, but tenfold in tools to build my life to what it is today.  It in a sense, it awakened my skills of who I am. I learned how to be a leader and a guide. I learned how time and being timely can effect everything. I hated the whole ordeal, a month without a toilet or a shower. We bathed in the waters. We ran out of deet half way through the program. But I tell you, that shower, albeit they only give you 5 minutes when the program ended, was the best thing in my life. I would do it again. Even though I was mocked and preyed upon by the other kids. I learned to manage and grow above it. I learned how to earn their respect and trust.  I learned about peoples' skills and weaknesses, and learned how to be a leader. I learned how to find what people are good at and keep them there, happy.  We learned how to navigate without a compass and conquer our fears.  That program gave me tools to use. I hope the other kids used them too.
$C: I was going to ask that as well. I don’t think fluoride would be very useful unless you’re worried about tooth enamel decay over a 3-day period for some reason. LOL.

A source of unreduced *fluorine* would be quite effective, but probably also against whatever you put the water in (including you). So I’m going to assume that OP was referring to tablets containing bleach or another source of chlorine.

PS/pet peeve: this is also why fluoride isn’t poisonous or “turns into hydrofluoric acid in your body”, as conspiracy theorists would have you believe. The chemical properties of an atom are defined by the configuration of the electrons in the hull. Elemental fluorine is dangerous because it’s an oxidiser. So are chlorine and iodine, but less so. Fluorides are *salts*. They’re the *product* of fluorine oxidising stuff, like CO2 is the product of oxygen oxidising carbon. You don’t look at a pile of dry ice and panic because it might explode. On the contrary, the fact that the reaction is so violent in one direction means the reverse (turning CO2 into carbon, or fluoride back into fluorine) is almost impossible to happen spontaneously.

Sodium fluoride has as much to do with fluorine or hydrofluoric acid as table salt has with chlorine or hydrochloric acid. Obviously you can poison yourself with an overdose of salt (or fluorides) as well, but not because of scary fluorine or chlorine, but because you’re upsetting the balance of different ions in your body.
$C: Probably iodine. Very common for water purification in a wilderness setting.
$C: Yeah, sorry, iodine.
$C: It wasn't a good place, I had jungle rot and the boots were drenched. But it was out of the breeze 
and rain. 
$C: They wanted to show us we don't need much to survive. If you dont move around, you really dont need much food.  One kid found my camp on the 2nd day and I gave him half of my food because he said he was starving. He said a squirrel destroyed his shit and ate his bag of food when he was exploring. A different kid decided it was a good idea to setup camp under a beehive. He destroyed the hive and was stung 10 or 12 times. We all could hear his screams.  Another kid was a choir boy, we could hear his echoes singing brittany spears every night.  We all hated it the first 2 days, but welcomed it the last. 
$C: So... it's completely unique?
$C: There's one about a spider too. Where someone who had been saving spiders their whole life is suddenly saved by them
$C: Holy shit. People like writing ✍️ 

Those posts are hella popular
$C: That subreddit only likes fantasy writing prompts.  You rarely ever see any prompts that are grounded much in reality because they only seem to be interested in ridiculous prompts.  I wish people would also find interest in more realistic scenarios

$C: It makes me so happy that Chrono Trigger is as popular as it is. Abba Zabbas, beef jerky, coffee (tea for me), and creamsicles aplenty as my grandpa and I took turns watching eachother play through it every night. Those were hands down the best memories I have of my childhood.
$C: https://youtu.be/IRQO5OKJjhM
$C: r/cronotriggered
$C: CCCYYYYRRRRRUUUUUUSSSSSSSS!
$C: Until I started actually reading about it I did not realize how Chrono cross and Chrono Trigger are so intricately interwoven. There is way more between the two then you might first think even if you play both games
$C: I forgot about that guy. 
$C: Nah, the two are mutually exclusive. You're cool. 
$C: Every time I think I’m just a giant piece of shit, I remember that I save bugs and love animals, so I can’t be *that* bad. Like I’m a sarcastic asshole, but at my core, I’m a good person. Or at least I try to be.
$C: Preach.  I'm a pretty lazy accountant, in fact I'm at work right now, but bah gawd if I see a critter I will either make it my friend, help it, or at least appreciate it.  

Hell, I saw a spider in a web on my front porch today, and it was blocking my usual path to my car.  And it even had another bug caught in it, so the spider had food lined up and everything.  

I walked/climbed around the web, because I didn't want to interrupt him or mess up his house.  

One day I'm going to work at an animal shelter or a zoo or SOMETHING.  That day just hasn't happened yet.  
$C: Are . . . Are you saving them for something sinister?
$C: like [this?](https://imgur.com/a/2IwnNi8) :)
$C: I saw a bumble bee in the middle of the side walk it was just lying there it couldn't fly away. I wanted to move it so it wouldn't get crushed when I went to move it, it stung my finger :(
$C: That's because those are wasps, jackass.
$C: You're good in my book.
$C: I totally understand. I do something kind for other humans almost everyday and somehow I'm still a selfish bitch. 
$C: One small step for man
$C: Perhaps if you sought it out just to destroy it, since that, like this, would require keen effort in pursuit of the moral goal.
$C: No, but it's an indicator for future terrible acts just like helping a small animal is an indicator for future kind acts. 
$C: What? I slay millions of sperm cells everyday. No one has said anything yet. 
$C: I don't think so. Killing a small creature is mostly inconsequential. Which is why *helping* a small creature is so grand: you have nothing to gain from it, you just do it because you want to help. 
$C: >If such a small act of kindness is considered to be the best type of kindness

I think your premise is wrong. Small acts of kindness are not necessarily the best, but perhaps they are the most telling. 

According to this theory that I just invented, if you could order all acts of kindness from smallest to biggest, doing any act of kindness X would guarantee that you would also do any act of kindness bigger than X. However, doing an act of kindness Y (where Y>X) doesn't necessarily mean you would also do X.

So in a way small acts of kindness are so precious because they show just how small your tolerance for other's suffering is. If this guy goes out of his way to help a frog, you just know he's a helper.

Of course this model is extremely simple and human behavior is way more complex than this, but simplifications have their uses.

Just my 0.02.

$C: Gates is hellbent on murdering every last mosquito there is, and sometimes I wonder if he doesn't wish he could do it with his bare hands.  Can't really say I think less of him for it, though 
$C: [deleted]
$C: This reminds me of a story told by (I think) Jack Kornfield, who has done a lot to communicate Buddhist concepts to the Western world.

A bunch of Tibetan monks found their monastery was completely overrun by roaches. They were in the food, in the beds, it was super gross. They went to the Master and said "Look, we know we're not supposed to take life, but these roaches are genuinely getting in the way of us doing our good works in the community, can we please kill them?"

The Master says "Nope, I'm not going to give you permission to kill them. Maybe you do need to, but I'm not going to sanction it. You have to decide that for yourselves." And the point of the story is that maybe sometimes you do need to kill the bugs, but you don't get any absolution-from-on-high. You have to decide for yourself that it's worth it, and live with it.

Personally, I try not to kill gnats and fruit flies and spiders. Mosquitos and roaches are fair game (by which I mean DIE, FUCKERS, DIE!!!). I once killed a rat in a rat trap and TBH I have felt horrible about it ever since.

TL;DR: No, killing a bug is not one of the worst acts you can commit, but you'll have to reckon with your own conscience on that one.
$C: The opposite would be killing something huge.
$C: Yes. Some heartless assholes actually swerve to try and hit squirrels and chipmunks.
$C: Jainism bruh
$C: I kill a lot of moths/flys/bugs in my house. Should I be worried? /s
$C: According to the bhagavad gita, all acts are essentially irrelevant because one cannot be killed nor ever manage to kill; only those that see themselves incorrectly as mortals are fooled by this illusion, and what really matters is the intent behind one's actions:


"The Supreme Lord said: While you speak words of wisdom, you are mourning for that which is not worthy of grief. The wise lament neither for the living nor for the dead.

Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be.


Just as the embodied soul continuously passes from childhood to youth to old age, similarly, at the time of death, the soul passes into another body. The wise are not deluded by this.


O son of Kunti, the contact between the senses and the sense objects gives rise to fleeting perceptions of happiness and distress. These are non-permanent, and come and go like the winter and summer seasons. O descendent of Bharat, one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.


O Arjun, noblest amongst men, that person who is not affected by happiness and distress, and remains steady in both, becomes eligible for liberation.


Of the transient there is no endurance, and of the eternal there is no cessation. This has verily been observed by the seers of the truth, after studying the nature of both.


That which pervades the entire body, know it to be indestructible. No one can cause the destruction of the imperishable soul.


Only the material body is perishable; the embodied soul within is indestructible, immeasurable, and eternal. Therefore, fight, O descendent of Bharat.


Neither of them is in knowledge—the one who thinks the soul can slay and the one who thinks the soul can be slain. For truly, the soul neither kills nor can it be killed.


The soul is neither born, nor does it ever die; nor having once existed, does it ever cease to be. The soul is without birth, eternal, immortal, and ageless. It is not destroyed when the body is destroyed.


O Parth, how can one who knows the soul to be imperishable, eternal, unborn, and immutable kill anyone or cause anyone to kill?


As a person sheds worn-out garments and wears new ones, likewise, at the time of death, the soul casts off its worn-out body and enters a new one.


Weapons cannot shred the soul, nor can fire burn it. Water cannot wet it, nor can the wind dry it.


The soul is unbreakable and incombustible; it can neither be dampened nor dried. It is everlasting, in all places, unalterable, immutable, and primordial.


The soul is spoken of as invisible, inconceivable, and unchangeable. Knowing this, you should not grieve for the body.


If, however, you think that the self is subject to constant birth and death, O mighty-armed Arjun, even then you should not grieve like this.


Death is certain for one who has been born, and rebirth is inevitable for one who has died. Therefore, you should not lament over the inevitable.


O scion of Bharat, all created beings are unmanifest before birth, manifest in life, and again unmanifest on death. So why grieve?"




Zen Buddhism holds basically the same view.
$C: I suppose it's an act of such incredible mindless cruelty that it gives a window into what you may do on a far grander scale.

$C: When I went to visit some remote communities in Australia, the kids were throwing giant tree frogs around. It was really sad to see and they just laughed at me when I asked them to stop it.
$C: And the biggest tragedy in life was finding a dead baby bird that had fallen from the nest :(

I will never forget feeling like my dad was superman when a nest of baby birds fell from a tree. He put it back it all in a plastic bowl and placed them back into the tree in it. 

Man, now I wanna be six years old again!
$C: Dad- "Here, put them in this Cool Whip container so they don't die. I even put some dirt in there for 'em."

Me- "Here's another one! It's still moving!"

Dad- "Good job. Throw it in here or it'll die on the sidewalk!"

Rousted out of bed the next morning to go fishing. Those worms weren't really rescued.

$C: > The case was dismissed; it says so in the very article you linked.

I'm aware of that, but I didn't say she was convicted, so I'm not sure what you're getting at.

> she was also told by the driver to stop and yet continued to ignore him, which is why it ended up going legal.

I understand perfectly why it went legal. What I'm calling out is the absurdity in that giving water to a thirsty exhausted animal in one setting is praised, while in another it is seen as  "wrong" by some.

> if some random stranger came up to my dog and I with water and started insisting my dog drink it, at the very least I would be suspicious

If your dog had been crammed into the back of a truck for hours on a sweltering day with nothing to drink, then I would think you would be grateful.

You're right, it is not the best analogy.


> their persistence may increase my mistrust of them to the point where I would refuse to let my dog drink their water, and depending on the interaction, reporting that person to the police is certainly a possibility.

In this case the intent was clearly to just provide a moment of relief for the pig. 

>but something like that could get him fired for not reporting due to the possibility of the insistent person having malicious intent (e.g. contaminated/poisoned water). 

That's fair, but it's also kind of pointless considering the pigs were literally on their way to be slaughtered. You seem desparate to find a reason to fault the woman. This is exactly the absurdity that I'm trying to highlight.

>Judging by your comment history, I suspect your interest in veganism is why you are so passionate about this subject

You've got it backwards. My interest in veganism isn't what makes me passionate about helping animals; my passion for helping other animals is what makes me interested in veganism.


>but that also appears to be a personal bias that's preventing you from seeing the whole picture here.


I disagree. My veganism is a result of decades of exercises in reasoning, questioning the status-quo, and adjusting for my biases.

You might as well say that carnism is your personal bias that is preventing you from seeing the big picture.

$C: My mom noticed him and thought it was a leaf. She touched him and he barely moved like he was lethargic. That’s what made me think maybe he needed some water. 
$C: Many tree frogs trust that their natural camouflage is enough to stay hidden, even on a painted fence post. Of all the frog varieties, I find tree frogs the easiest to capture; toads being a close second place.

It should be noted that alongside absorbing water through their skin, they also absorb a ton of other chemicals. The oils produced by human skin, plus any other things you may be carrying can be very harmful to them. *If* you need to handle any amphibian, it’s best practice to wear gloves, or at the very least wash your hands and keep them wet with water that isn’t from the tap.  This is (in almost all cases) for the animal’s safety, not your own. 
$C: It was probably somewhat used to human presence, and way too hot.
$C: We have them everywhere where I live (American South) if you spot one you can usually get within inches of it and as long as you dont touch it it won't move much or at all, it'll just watch you watching it. If you touch it though it will launch itself pretty much in any direction, up to and including your face.
$C: I’ve found tree Frogs to be pretty chill, we used to have a huge tree frog that lived at our house, we would frequently see her around and she never really cared that we were nearby. We did something similar during a 10year drought for her but sadly the heat was too much as she disappeared.  We lost a lot of our tree frogs after that drought.
$C: Well frogs aren't lizards so there is that. 
$C: Tree frogs don’t hop away like pond frogs. They’re pretty lazy. 
$C: But he loved the full bowl... Who doesn't! 
$C: Yes.
$C: But these aren't "frikin frogs"...
$C: Is that a question or a statement? Because it definitely depends where you live. I live in a city with some of the worst water in the US and it's definitely not healthy to drink; not fatal, just nowhere near purified water.
$C: Yeah, it does. And there's also other chems like calcium and stuff, which doesn't seem bad, but the calcium levels in our tap is different than the levels they might expect to find in the wild.

Thanks for the clarification though! I was very curious. Because I have definitely seen a dead frog in my yard that looked like it got caught out in the sun and kinda just dried up and died. Honestly got cooked was a more apt description.. so seeing this made me quite happy on the bright side! Lol.

I was just sorted by controversial and every comment was someone being a dick about Fahrenheit vs Celsius and which one is the "real" units and terms and your comment was mixed in with them.

$C: I love cicadas until one of those monsters falls out of a tree and you see how terrifying they are
$C: You must not have the same breed of cicadas that lived outside my house growing up... 

I don't mind then as much now that the woods aren't right up to the house and i have AC and can have the window closed while I'm trying to sleep.
$C: Me too, it reminds me of home. My cat and I were watching The Sinner and in one of the scenes they had cicadas going pretty loud and she immediately peeled up and stared intently at the screen. No cicadas in LA
$C: Do U hear them every day for months on end? 
End up yearning for silence. 
$C: Fuck cicadas.
$C: It's a wonderful sound. Reminds me of being a kid and playing outside in the summer.
$C: The best day of my vacation in Greece was when the noise from the cicadas or whatever loud insect it was because background noise. God bless habituation. 
$C: > I find the sound of cicadas relaxing

[Ever been to Japan?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ifu_kWqx38)

They have [many different types of cicada.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFOaGPNT55U) There are different onomatopoeia for the [different sounds they make.](https://metropolisjapan.com/the-screaming-insects-of-summer/) There are even toy noisemakers [that are supposed to sound like cicada (miiiiiiiin-miiiiiiiin)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKbjTExE3go). Though in this video, there's also a frog one and they kind of sound the same. 

[This video does a better job with the toy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh4mJdHyrMU), but wasn't as cute. 

[This one is just weird.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM03rJM5IC4)
$C: Cicadas or katydids? I find the sound of katydids to be relaxing; Associate it with summer and being outside.
$C: Cicadas make me think of summer, which was most welcome when I lived in the frigid North.
$C: When I'm going to sleep, noises like that actually help.

I don't have tinnitus, but there's something relaxing about hearing natural noises from your window.

One thing I like about where I live is the owls hooting and screeching.
$C: I like the noise too. Not sure it's just cicadas or frogs or what. Just a skreet-skreet-skreet. The jungle that is my backyard has a stream running through it. I love just sitting on a hot night listening to the cacophony.
$C: Bet you hate when they all spawn and cover the walkways. Every 7 years this happens in Princeton NJ. Then about 3 years later, the cidada-killer wasps spawn. Wasps. The size of cicadas. Yeah. Try to sleep now with that image in your head.
$C: I grew up calling them "locusts"
$C: I found the sound of cicadas like the background noise in nearly every anime
$C: Wait until you see them
$C: Same. I used to hate them as a kid, but the sound grew on me. 
$C: Odd. Any idea what species? I don't know that I've ever heard that kind of frog.

$C: It's a pool.... 

Like, 5 billions caps worth of water. And that's probably an under estimation, to say the least.
$C: No, but we didn't beforehand either. It's not super swampy in my suburb.

Mosquitoes don't like water deeper than 3Ocm.
$C: Because we never swam in it and it's expensive to maintain when no one swims in it.

The local councils around here run [pool to pond programs](http://www.kmc.nsw.gov.au/Current_projects_priorities/Key_priorities/Environment_sustainability/Our_community_programs/WildThings/Pool_to_Pond), to create native pools to create a new landscape in your backyard and foster biodiversity. This is in Australia.
$C: Uncommon defense strategies against predation is one of my favourite things to read about in fuzzy animal biology.

My favourite example are certain species of horses... If they detect that one of their number is aging or wounded, they will gang up against that one horse, kill, and eat them.

In doing so, they prevent those nutrients from being passed on to predators who would otherwise pick them off later. They deny those resources to their enemies in a way that few animals can stomach.

$C: Frog bro.
$C: I had to say it - it's a great comment! I like that you wrote in present tense, it really brought me into the moment.
$C: hah, that's wild. good story, thanks a lot for sharing it. you were a bad kid, are you a good adult now?
$C: Let's not jump to conclusions 
$C: Just like any Disney movie that asks, "what if we gave *blank* feelings???"
$C: On reddit? Nah
$C: Nope, you're going to have to give partial writing credit to the indebted squirrel authors.
$C: Yes, there are no varying degrees of uniqueness. However, being unique does not disqualify similarities.
$C: Spiderbro?
$C: I don’t know why, but I appreciate your superfluous emoji.
$C: I googled "reddit writing prompts life debt" and these were the top three results.

Amazing game. I love chrome cross as well- I dream of a badass remake one day
$C: I beat my wife every day but I also volunteer at an animal shelter.

Am I good?
$C: Maybe that's how Hitler justified it too.
$C: Just call me Oprah
$C: Exactly like that.
$C: Poor little guy was probably really spooked :/
$C: If you smash a spider, could the intention be anything other than immoral?  For example, self-defense?
$C: I refuse to stop killing mosquitoes, ticks, and wasps.
$C: Thank you.  My conscience was at unease.  
$C: I used to feel a tad guilty for killing flies, but my cat does the dirty work for me now. 
$C: If we save 1 for every other we kill.

That makes our morality perfectly balanced would it not?
$C: Look, the spider is cool when I can see it. It's when I look away, then look back and he's gone..

I can't trust him. He has to die.
$C: Now this just jumps into the lab rat debate doesn't it. Finding cures for diseases and whatnot.
$C: Then that means all humans are on the path to evil, as we all kill insects, intentionally or not.
$C: Sweet Jain.
$C: Your karma is building.  And your future self is frowning at you, in shame.  
$C: Right...But if you kill, even when you have nothing to gain from it, you are displaying the most negative use of force imaginable, on a small scale.  Either helping a small creature is inconsequential, or it's grand....
$C: People didn't like Jesus, either.  
$C: Thank you for this quote.  I haven't heard too many quotes about small acts of kindness, now that I think about it...Maybe one or two...
$C: Thank you for the reply.  I took note from the Buddhist story.

But you are considering the act itself.  Killing a bug is way less severe than killing a person for moral, legal, and consequential reasons...That much is obvious.  But the *nature* of the act is the same (perhaps).  
$C: That is a slippery slope of thinking.  You are devaluing their existence, and making them easier to kill, morally.  Unless they are pests, I wouldn't consider bugs, or amphibians, as any less of a being than I. 
$C: Crazy glue behaves in uncharacteristic ways... cuz it’s crazy.

$C: yo
$C: yes, it's a sinking feeling when they start up at 6am

You know it's gonna be a scorcher
$C: Oof. I moved from a cool climate to a very, very warm one. As soon as I hear the first cicada of the season, I know I'm in for a miserable six-to-nine-months.

It should never be 100 degrees in either March or October, god damn it!
$C: They make me think of anime summers of years past.
$C: They make me think of cliched anime
$C: ptsd waking up for marching band in Texas with cicadas and that one owl 🦉 fuckin hoooooo hoo hoo hooooooooo hoo hoo hooooooo
$C: They are the sound of heat on a Summer day.  
$C: I feel like it’s an extra five degrees hotter when I hear cicadas.
$C: They make me think of summer in any anime ever.
$C: I have never even heard of cicadas before.  Youtube did not disappoint, they do sound terrifying. 
$C: They aren't too bad.  They don't bite.

If you ride a motorcycle without a full face helmet you will absolutely hate them though.
$C: I guess maybe it’s a toad? A quick google search showed [this one](http://www.wec.ufl.edu/extension/wildlife_info/frogstoads/gastrophryne_carolinensis_carolinensis.php) and the [Sheep Frog](http://www.californiaherps.com/noncal/misc/miscfrogs/pages/h.variolosus.sounds.html) . I’m very close to Florida, so it may be the first one. The calls are the same so idk. 
$C: Definitely not always true - I've been with two women who have been quite loud and not because they wanted to be 

Although sometimes right around orgasm they get quiet 
$C: That’s true. I was in Meridian, MS when the 17-year cicadas were out and they were so loud, it was impossible to carry a conversation outside. It was impressive, but trying to sleep through that would be hell. 
$C: The hell, you've let your pool go so long it has become an ecosystem that attracts herons? 
$C: Eventually it will figure out that the crocs aren't real. You should have released giant snakes.
$C: It’s okay to have herons there actually, they help keep up good genes in the frogs by weeding out injured ones. 

They’re also quite beautiful birds which are fun to watch, perhaps you could invite him over again. I love frogs (I have two as pets and rescue any that I find stranded away from ponds), but herons deserve some love too! 
But good one you for going green. 
$C: #heronlivesmatter
$C: Somebody smarter then me needs to do the math. 
$C: People pee in pools. You don't see anyone peeing in bottle caps unless.
$C: You might be surprised just how much a billion is
$C: I'm not happy about using a capital "o" for a zero but you had some really unique information so we cool.
$C: I feel like turning a pool into a pond might resukt in costly damages to pipes and such
$C: Betrayal of the Fittest.
$C: Your logic isn't quite sound. Perhaps if there was no house in that place, there would instead be a tree there, or a pond, or a rock with a tiny frog shaped overhang that projects a frog shaped shadow in just the perfect way for this little fella to spend his afternoon cold chillin'.
$C: Quit being miserable 
$C: So you're telling me that mother nature made that building?
$C: Humans aren't natural now? Interesting to hear your thoughts on Beaver Dams and other animal structures
$C: It was a beautiful triple combo of references.
$C: Doctor Who -  "*Moisturize me"* 

Silence of the Lambs (sort of) -  "It puts the lotions in the bottle cap"  
Zoolander - "Moisture is the essence of wetness. Wetness is the essence of beauty."  


Keep up ;)
$C: The Silence were certainly fantastic!
$C: And fiction.... But dont let that get in the way.   Lol.   

My favorite was "Angles take Manhattan" and i was in tears at the end of the 2nd part... 

I miss my Ponds.
$C: Just DONT BLINK
$C: [deleted]
$C: It is kind of fitting that you get your chronology confused when talking about Doctor Who.
$C: Boos in Mario beat it by 20 years
$C: Which was fantastic in Blink since they never moved on screen even if nobody was looking at them...

But then they fucked that up
$C: The Girl in the Fireplace too.

And The Empty Child for the fear factor
$C: Did we ever get to see the monster for "Midnight"

^ormaybeitwasbecausethepeoplewerethemonstersinthatepisooooddeee 
$C: Listen is also a great episode. And the Where's My Mummy episode (I forget the title)
$C: I loved all of those. Although I'd replace silence in the library with the waters of mars for my top 3.
$C: If I might add a couple of other recent ones.

I'd add Mummy on the Orient Express and Flatline to that list of really interesting creature designs/backgrounds
$C: The funny thing is that the showrunners didn't have much expectation for Blink and it turned out to be one of the most loved episodes of the entire series.
$C: The Silence in the library 2 parter was what got me hooked. 
$C: Flcl? Fooly coolie? 
$C: I think the justification they used for that was that they were very deteriorated, and was healing by soaking in the energy of the crashed ship. That episode was still cracking thou; the whole 'An image of an angel is an angel' thing is fucking terrifying.
$C: Biggest problem with the Weeping Angels, Blink literally did them perfectly, so it was hard to ever make more episodes and innovate with them because it was just impossible to match Blink

Not to say other Angels episodes weren't good, it's just... not as good as Blink, but very few episodes in the entire history of the show can compare
$C: Best comment ever. EVER!
$C: It would be great if it seemed like an unused abandoned sub until you subscribed, and then it was a huge active one.

Sounds unfeasible in a few ways, though. :)
$C: What if the sub is so small because the franchise is so bad? Hmmm 

No I'm just joshin ya bro.
$C: Eh. LMFAO had their shot. They were as much comedy as music, and with rare exception (weird Al), those bands don't last forever. 
$C: I feel like it fit with the time, if anything. I remember it was somewhat cool to talk ish on techno/electronic music as just for brain dead candy ravers, then the late 2000s hit, and it's all the rave pop-wise and infused on nearly everything on the radio.
$C: I mean, they found commercial success after working for five whole years as a group.  Obviously they had been doing it for far too long and needed to stop.
$C: I was a senior in high school when this song came out so now I feel old. 
$C: Pornography. This is the internet.
$C: After all are we humans? Or are we dancers
$C: It really humanizes the humans
$C: r/puns
$C: This interaction was the fucking Internet in a nutshell. Literally nothing but memes. 
$C: And yet, they can still like it for its wholesomeness. 
$C: But we don't have to 
$C: Like a cross between "tubular" and "on fleek". I get it now. Thanks.

Is it true that your specie is made out of meat?


$C: Yeah, water stinks.
$C: No, because we also now smell through our skin.
$C: Not with my anosmia
$C: Vodka. Good Vodka has little smell. On other hand I wish I could adsorb water so I didn't need to drink it to stay alive.
$C: Hmm, this vat smells like Uncle Joe.
$C: Good vodka does not smell
$C: Vodka has no smell. That's why alcoholics drink it
$C: Plus evolution would've probably played a role in giving us a better feel for what we're submerged in. Also evolved livers for the vodka and whiskey pools! Beer would still just be a drink, gross pube foam all over the place hahah way too graphic in my mind!! 
$C: Good vodka doesn't smell
$C: I'm gonna need a source on that second one.
$C: Whiskey can be vodka or moonshine but vodka can never be whiskey. 
$C: Iirc one of the highst BACs recorded was in a woman that filled her bath with vodka.
$C: It's not really quick, topical absorption is the slowest out of any method and it has to get through 7 layers of skin, amongst other things. The quickest way, other than injecting it, is ass funneling.
$C: Also nicotine, gotta be careful if you get into making your own juice for vaping 
$C: Im right in the pocket ran bears
$C: Yes.




Same thing.
$C: Holy shit. 
$C: I... don't think that's right... 
$C: Not takka. 
$C: Wholesale prices from a large distillery we’re looking at about $1 per litre so even then, yeah it’s gonna be pricey. Vodka hot tub might be manageable. 
$C: I’ve seen some pretty salty people before....
$C: And the little streams of alcohol come trickling down the rocks
$C: They mythbusted it once too and confirmed it 
$C: He probably got a little rectal absorption honestly.
$C: What beer did he use? Asking for a science friend.
$C: I thought you were talking about the superman villain, and was like I need to read this now, then it clicked you meant the show
$C: could also be the vapor. 
$C: Wonder if inhaling the evaporation from the bath might have an effect on that.
$C: Is it not from inhaling the alcohol evaporating off? I’d imagine that would be more effective than through our skin
$C: I mean, I could blow over the limit given half an hour just by drinking beer. Just gotta chug. Or drink high ABV beer. 
$C: I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
$C: Yeah that’s what I thought but I couldn’t find anything on it
$C: no
$C: Yes, that is how he ultimately died, but the person above said he ALMOST died in a beer cask. That’s also true. Houdini almost died a number of times.
$C: Actually he had appendicitis, which the punches in his stomach are believed to have confused the pain, it is likely that if he didn’t get punched he would have been able to realize something else was causing the extreme pain he was in. There is no known link between getting stomach punched and appendicitis. I read the entire Wikipedia on Houdini last night randomly, that’s how I know this lol.
$C: Oh I'm stealing that :)
$C: Well just like anything cool it starts with your butthole. 
$C: Science! This article does a really good job explaining it:

$C: Ya my friend told me it was a good idea back in my early 20's and when I did it I was already drunk... So I swear it works!
$C: Im a geologist and everyone knows this. What's wrong with you man? Next thing you'll be telling me that pee isnt stored in the balls.
$C: It must be gneiss to be a geologist.
$C: I am no geologist, but I do like whiskey on the rocks.
$C: go on....
$C: Thank-you. You now have a 2018 subscription to frog facts and will receive hourly updates.


Did you know, frogs eat their own skin? To not waste all the nutritious protein found in their skin. Frogs shed their skin periodically like most animals, but they do not slough it off and leave it behind. Frogs actually push the shedding skin into their mouth and eat it. This is the ultimate way to recycle all the components they used to produce their skin.
$C: Lepidobatrachus laevis, widely known as Budgett's frog, is a species of frog in the family Ceratophryidae, discovered by John Samuel Budgett. The wide-mouth frog is well adapted to its environment, notably the harsh winter. During this time it will remain inactive underground in a cocoon of dead skin. 
$C: My dude.
$C: Some frogs can jump over 20 times their own body length; that is like a human jumping 30m!

$C: Yeah! Chrono Cross never got quite the hype but I loved it. I never finished it though because my 1st disc would freeze right at the point that you needed to switch discs. I tried like 20 times and gave up.

$C: Karma is collected over many lifetimes; who's to say?
$C: I think I’m okay as long as I just keep making acerbic or morbid jokes and not trying to wipe an entire race of people off the planet.
$C: Apathy, at best. Spiders can be non-fatally removed with great ease
$C: I had a vegan roommate who got pissed if anyone killed most bugs, especially spiders. 

She went out of her way to kill cockroaches and mosquitoes. She said she made an exception for those because they didn’t deserve to live. I don’t know if she was being morally consistent, but I didn’t disagree with her.
$C: Those animals pose a threat to you. Most other animals we kill on a regular basis do not.
$C: I'd say that's almost self defense. 


I'm sure you'd agree that someone who does let mosquitoes, ticks and wasps go could do some real good in the world though. 

There's an argument that killing those pests stops other life from being killed or hurt, but that's a dangerous line to walk. 
$C: I try to be kind towards most walks of life, but mosquitos can fuck right off. 
$C: Why wasps?
$C: What about fleas?
$C: Theres a difference between pest control, and harming social animals like cats, dogs, rabbits, or squirrels. 
$C: May I suggest you look at a bugassault? It may make for a good time, just not with the wasps. I would suggest gasoline or wasp spray for those.
$C: I dont kill wasps unless its in self defence, same goes for mosquitoes. 

But ill fucking destroy any ticks I come across.
$C: Man, _fuck_ mosquitoes! It's one of the only species humans are actively considering eradicating, and when considering the ecological impact even the experts are like, ["Eh, it'll be fine!"](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/kill-all-mosquitos-180959069/)

Plus, we literally named one specific species "useless." This is how much we value mosquitoes.
$C: Can we add cockroaches 
$C: It depends on where you live, but there are very few spiders that can actually seriously hurt you. Usually the ones that can aren't aggressive. /r/spiderbro


$C: I beleive motivation is key. 

I just linked this for another comment while talking about Buddhism, but it seems like it fits here. 

>“skillful means” (upaya kausalya).  Under certain circumstances one may violate precepts when one’s motivation is wholesome.

While killing rats is wrong, the motivation is to prevent future deaths so it's somewhat justifiable even if you consider all life to be equal. If you also believe that humans are more important than rats it seems like a very clear answer. 

$C: Nope, it's just an indicator and really only matters in terms of judging morality when you make a conscious decision. 
$C: I've never heard that saying. What are you saying? 
$C: You kinda have something to gain from killing a mosquito in your room. It won't bite you if it's dead.
$C: Staying true to your username. I see you Satan’s son
$C: I agree, killing a bug is way less severe than killing a person, for lots and lots of very good reasons :-)
$C: That’s literally how they operate, you should read about ants. 
$C: *Maaaan*
$C: Well, it's a solubulized cyanoacrylate in a rapidly vaporizing solvent.... pretty sure it would dry faster. 
$C: zack snyder's hardcore uncut version of avril lavigne's signature song
$C: Where is this from? Sounds like an interesting read.
$C: I had forgotten that was a thing. 
$C: I was really proud of myself for it. 
$C: A lot of people would be amazed about what kinds of other wildlife they have in their area if they did some research. Most of the "cool" species are usually never seen because they are either in very specific locations (not occupied by humans) or nocturnal. Not that I thought it was tropical, but I was amazed when I found out that we have Hell Benders here in Ohio.
$C: No, that's not it at all. I actually am able to change my mind. In fact, I did so when I went vegan.

Your response is such a cop-out.
$C: :D

Frogs are pretty cool, I love them! We have a great variety in Australia.

$C: Moral: If you see a little pool ocer a ledge jump in it. Even when havinf hallucinations. They are always real.
$C: “Don’t let your dreams be dreams” - this frog probably.
$C: The 'drier' amphibians are slightly less susceptible, for what that's worth.  Though it's still not a reason to handle them willy-nilly.
$C: Same here 🙁
$C: The instinct is still there, albeit their camouflage isn't strictly color "matching", but appearing as non-prey objects like leaves, clumps of fungus or piles of bird poop.  In fact, I believe the frog in the video is a young Gray Tree Frog.  They lose that green coloration as they mature, and their bird poop coloration/pattern becomes more apparent.  The green coloration as a young animal helps them blend in with small leaves on foliage near the ponds where they metamorphose, and later the lichens on the trees where they spend most of their lives.
$C: Thankfully not *that* bad!
$C: No, it doesn't. And that's because it's a small amount of chlorine. Just enough to keep away any bacteria/algae/etc while the water sits stagnant in our pipes. But the small amount of chlorine that we can't pick up is enough to really mess up an amphibians skin.
$C: Agreed. They're a tad polarizing.
$C: I googled 'frog puns'.

It's not work time for everyone, Mister.
$C: There's not one way to prepare escargot either. It's a dish with snails. It's fine if you don't know what it is, but your "I'm not rich or French" quip is really stupid, you have to admit.
$C: I will do as you please master
$C: Years before I even knew what a cicada was, I knew that noise meant "it's fucking hot."
$C: Can confirm.  Cicadas going strong at 6:30am in Dallas, Tx high today expected to be 109
$C: ['Nother scorcher? You better call Sears.](https://youtu.be/4rqZZgVxnCk)
$C: lol here in Japan they start at like 4:30
$C: It means it’s gonna be a great day.
$C: Come to Wisconsin. It's still snowing in May
$C: It's Florida. You're in Florida, arentcha?
$C: AZ?
$C: This last winter in San Antonio it was only cold for 4 weeks, after that back to the 80s/90s and 100s from June to November. We live in summer here, that's it. 
$C: Look up their life cycle, it’s not pretty. They live in the ground for twelve years, dig out with massive gross claws, climb up a tall tree, shed their shell and lose their claws in exchange for giant gross wings, make tons of noise, mate, and die.
$C: They come out during mating season in huge swarms... And then die.
$C: My fear of bugs is not logical. Doesn't matter if they bite I'm still running away and screaming like a toddler.
$C: It sounds like what a cartoon sheep sounds like 
$C: It's almost certainly the narrowmouth toads. I grew up in Florida and the only good part about summer was the constant chorus of robot sheep impressions coming from these little bastards.
$C: If you follow my link down further, it was a conscious effort to create a natural pond.
$C: My parents fish pond is completely clean and filtered and that attracts Herons too. 
Herons just want to eat fish, they don't care what the pond looks like.
$C: And tons of mosquitoes...
$C: Well he hasn't been back.
$C: Needs to be sent over to r/theydidthemonstermath
$C: You would be correct. The folks at r/theydidthemonstermath showed I was way over
$C: I really don't understand why people care so much about the capital O :P My zero key is broken.
$C: Which pipes?
$C: Whether or not you agree with what he's saying is a different story, but he's talking about natural selection. The frogs that don't die from heat in this situation are either smarter or more resistant to heat, and as they breed they will make respectively smarter or more resistant offspring. The weaker ones will die in the heat and their genes won't be passed on. This is the basis of evolution and we should all strive for it. Helping wild animals disturbs this process.

But yeah, this is /r/aww and probably not the best situation to bring that up. I doubt this one small act of helping this frog caused trouble
$C: I hate when people say this. Look up the definition of natural. 

Is a computer natural? 
$C: Happy cake day!!

$C: What if i just sit your ass in it in the bath..some will get up there at least
$C: There is a reason why we have the phrase "blowing smoke up someone's ass." It used to be a method of resuscitation and involved blowing tobacco smoke up a person's rectum.

$C: It's stored in the dresser.

Obviously I know urine is held in the bladder. Yes, I vaguely know where the bladder is in the human body. Yes, I realise women don’t have testicles. 

But god damn, I don’t know why my eyes bulged so much when I realised that the balls don’t hold pee.

$C: Hey it accidentally happens sometimes, try not to think of it too much if it does.
$C: Most house spiders can’t survive outside though. So either way you’re signing their death warrant. In reality, anyone who brings a spider outside is unintentionally being much more cruel than those who kill them immediately.
$C: Those are the worst bugs. 

Spiders kill other bugs. 

Enemy of my enemy idea, I think it passes. 
$C: I've never been vegan but I went through a phase where I started thinking that spiders have a role to play, such as killing random bugs, so I'd let them live.
Ants, as long as there weren't too many, were sort of a clean up crew for crumbs, so I let them live.

But cockroaches? Flat out serve no purpose. Mosquitos? Worse than serving no purpose they serve a negative purpose. 
$C: Spiders do so much good, but many people go straight for the death sentence for them.  They really help control the fruit fly situation in my apartment when I bring home bananas.  Plus some of them are like miniature doggos with cute little fuzzy paws and bright inquisitive eyes<3  Most of them don't want to hurt anyone, but I do agree with killing venomous spiders when they're invading your home.

Cockroaches and mosquitoes and ticks on the other hand..  They spread disease.  But then again botflies don't spread disease.
$C: i’m a very strict veg and i’ll leave any insect alone until it bites me or stings me. i won’t hurt anything until it hurts me. every organism deserves to live (except poachers), but if an organism decides to attack or feed on me then i act in self-defense, it’s the circle of life.
$C: Mosquitoes are mean, and cockroaches breed out of control. I have sympathy for predatory bugs and pollinators though. 
$C: What do roaches do besides be gross? And honestly, a squished one is more disgusting than a live 'un.
$C: I went to home
$C: I have seen mosquito experts talk about not having a solid ecological reason to have them around short of being a food source for some animals. So if they can die as food they can die as pests.
$C: The spiders will give me a heart attack.  The spiders pose a threat.  The spiders must die...
$C: r/spiderbro
$C: Are you killing animals on a regular basis?
$C: go vegan 
$C: Everything is the way it's supposed to be.

There is no other way it could be.

A unique and unbreakable causal chain leads to every single moment.

Nothing you do is your own action, but rather the whole of reality contriving to use you as a puppet.

In this sense, there are no bad decisions or actions, and no dangerous lines to walk. 

You will do exactly as reality intended you to do.
$C: I let wasps go. Make sure they can't nest too close through vigilance and taking any startup nests down. I'm not one to get scared by wasps and bees since I know they don't seek to harm us unless in defense.

Fuck mosquitoes and ticks though. Sorry but whatever you believe in made those lil fuckers our eternal enemies.
$C: Refusal to accept that line is anti intellectual.  It's like batman costing gotham dozens of lives by allowing the joker to kill them again and again.
$C: There's an extremely relevant story about a man that's wants so badly to become buddha-like:

Asanga spent five years  in the monastery learning thousands of verses of dharma and understanding them. Asanga was very much inspired by the qualities of Maitreya Buddha. He went to the 'bird mountain' to live there meditating on the Maitreya. He meditated there for 3 years. Even after three years of hard penance Asanga couldn't recognize any significant changes inside him, Asanga got discouraged and started walking away thinking of quitting.

On his way he sees a crow flying into its nest, which on its way had created marks on the rocks by the friction of its wings with the rocks (as there was only a small hole through the rock to its nest). Asanga thinks 'I must not give up very easily, the crow must have been flying to and fro from the nest for a long time for the marks to be that big'. He goes back to the cave to continue his meditation for 3 more years.

After three years he was still unhappy about his progress and again thought of quitting his practice once and for all, on his way down the hill he heard 'tip tip' sounds of water drops falling on the rock. There he saw deep holes on the surface of the rock, and he thought 'something as soft as water has made holes in this hard rock, I must carry on my penance if I want to see significant changes in me'. 

So he went back to the cave and continued his meditation, japa and other spiritual practices for another three years, with much more effort than previous years. It was painful but he endured it with patience, after three years once again he felt discouraged, he had lost his patience, when he was walking in the nearby village he saw an old man making needles from iron pieces by rubbing the surface of pieces with smooth cotton cloth, 'I'm just finishing this one, look I have already made all those over there' he said.

'If it is possible to put such an effort on something as trivial as this, then I must put great effort on something as great as Enlightenment' thought Asanga, and went back to the cave to meditate for 3 more years.

It was 12 years now from the time Asanga first started. He was still unhappy with his progress, once while walking in the village he heard a dog cry in pain. He looked for the dog around and found it, the dog was infested with maggots, its body was so rotten that it only had front legs and some more part left, it was in serious pain.

Asanga felt the pain of the dog. He rushed with a stick to remove the maggots from the wound, as the stick touched the wound the dog gave a cry of pain, so now Asanga tried to remove the worms with his fingers, but still the dog felt the pain when his fingers touched the wound.

Now Asanga thought 'I should use my tongue, it is softer' and as he removed the worms from the wound the dog transformed into the 'light body' of Maitreya (the future Buddha) which glowed even in daylight with beautiful light rays shooting out of him in every direction.

Asanga was thrilled to see Maitreya, but the pain he had to endure for this moment was great. so he asked the Maitreya 'O great one, I had to go through so much pain, you did not come to me when I wanted to see you, but you are here when I have no more desires'

Maitreya replied 'Dear, I was always near you, but you were unable to see me, now that your compassion for the helpless dog has removed the cloud of your Karma, you are able to see me. If you don't believe me, you can test my words, carry me on your shoulder and check if anyone else sees me'

Asanga carried Maitreya on his shoulders and walked into a town crying out loudly 'Do you see what I'm carrying on my shoulders? please tell me what am I carrying?' most people laughed at him thinking he was a fool for they saw nothing on his shoulder.

An old woman, who must have been a kind person saw a dead dog on his shoulder 'you are carrying a dead dog' she replied. Another person who was a good slave to his master saw the feet of Maitreya, 'you are carrying somebody on your shoulder' he said (stories say he achieved a higher state on realization for being able to see even his feet). 

Now Asanga was sure that nobody could saw Maitreya because of their Karma. Maitreya asked Asanga 'What is your wish now? what do you want to do?'

Asanga replied 'I want to spread the teachings of the great enlightened one (Gautama Buddha)'

'Then come with me' said the Maitreya and started ascending into a higher realm of existence (Tushita heaven), Asanga held an end of Maitreya's robe and it enabled him to raise with him. In that realm Asanga studied the teachings for 50 years, when he was fully ready to spread the words of the Buddha he came back to the earth. Asanga lived till the ripe age of 120 teaching the knowledge of enlightenment.


There's another version of this story where asanga cuts  his leg open to allow the maggots to feast on his flesh so they will not perish. This extreme Act of compassion removes asanga from the cycle of rebirth by breaking his karmaticdebt, and reveals the Buddha to Asanga, and it is revealed that the dog is asanga's reincarnated father
$C: Same
$C: Because some species (of which my experience is all with yellow jackets) are unpredictable and aggressive, so if those types land on me or build a nest too close to somewhere I use, they sign their death warrants.

Harmless wasps, on the other hand, are fine.
$C: Best killed by regular bathing, since any other method is more trouble than it's worth. In which case they're more incidental casualties than anything else.
$C: Oh yeah I know they're harmless for the most part, although I do live in an area where Brown Recluse are found pretty commonly. I just start to itch all over once I lose sight of it and it drives me crazy, so squish it is.
$C: I agree that killing animals with malice is an indicator, but the threshold is not usually placed at insects.

$C: Ants operate by "That is a slippery slope of thinking.  You are devaluing their existence, and making them easier to kill, morally.  Unless they are pests, I wouldn't consider bugs, or amphibians, as any less of a being than I."?  What do you mean?
$C: If it WAS Krazy glue, then OP would have a permanently bonded frog and plastic cap stuck to their fingers and would serve as just rewards. Krazy glue instantly bonds to skin.

$C: Man im pretty sure Newfoundland has like 1 species of frog and the rest is just american toads
$C: I grew up northern nsw and we got green tree frogs and I loved them. Loud but very cool. 
$C: I just chill to the max, when I sits in my cap of water to relax
$C: When I was younger specially I liked catching toads because they're so easy to catch! But then they look scared, with their toad winces, so you feel bad.  


Sometimes it was so they stopped being lost in the basement, though.
$C: You win this thread. 
$C: henen
$C: Confirmed. 109° in San Antonio and cicadas are screaming their fucking heads off. I hate each and every one.
$C: Can confirm, Cicadas going strong in Dallas. Fuck this heat. 
$C: From mansfield here, can confirm
$C: Thankfully we don't have that store, which wastes so much paper on dockets, in Australia.
$C: I did not grow up in Wisconsin specifically, but I grew up in a similar climate. I thought I would never miss the 6 months of winter every year. I was so, so wrong.

Also, a dear friend of mine lives in Wisconsin, and I've visited several times. Your state is gorgeous, and I hope you take the opportunity to appreciate your state parks as much as possible. Wyalusing, in particular, has given me many great memories! The whole Driftless Area is just so pretty. 
$C: It's May in Wisconsin? Buddy, we're in July. Get with the times!
$C: Grew up in Wisconsin, and moved down south 15 years ago. Thought I would never miss the weather. But you know what's just as bad as grey gloomy 6 month winters? 90+ degree, humid 6 month summers followed by freezing wet windy, albeit not as cold, winters with almost no fall or spring. It's taken nearly half my life but I am finally considering moving somewhere where it's not absolutely miserable outside 90% of the year. 
$C: Yeah but your summers are amazing. Visited Madison...nearly told my wife to pack our shit and get ready to move. Then my buddy, who lives there, reminded me of the snow situation. Nooooo thanks. 
$C: I mean in PA,not even in the mountains, a couple years ago it was 75° one week and the next week we got 31 inches of snow. Two weeks later back to low 80s.
$C: What if I could offer you the worst of both worlds? Come on down to Colorado, where you can have a snowstorm and 100+ degree weather within 2 months of each other
$C: I grew up on Lac Du Flambaeu, my sister is still there. Last May, it snowed so much they couldn't get the tractor out and work because they got 5 or more feet of snow (I can't remember how much exactly) 
$C: Dude, I was just there and I think I'm in love with your state. And I'm definitely in love with your cheeses. 
$C: It’s been 108 in TX all week 🙃
$C: Same in Utah. Although we didn’t see snow until January where I’m at
$C: Come to Nebraska. We once had snow in mid-April, then 100 degrees the next week where I live.
$C: May is the middle of spring, of course it's still going to snow... now if you had said it's still snowing in July, then that would be extreme
$C: Nope! And thank god for that. Florida sounds like the absolute worst experience of America ever. 
$C: Nope. Not trying to give out my specific location, but I will say we're both hot and humid for most of the year.
$C: Hey I'm not seeing your link but I'm super interested and would really appreciate a pm!
$C: You can actually go out and get little minnows called [mosquito](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquitofish) fish. They kinda look like gray guppies. They are AMAZING at killing of mosquito larvae and even adults that aren't careful when laying their eggs.

I just get them from a nearby river and acclimate them into my koi pond, but there are also pest control companies that will dump loads of them into ponds, creeks, and other bodies of water on your property. 

If they aren't native to your area, you can also opt for other minnows that are native, but mosquito fish are hardy and very good at what they do. 

Edit: also, consider adding some vegetation for them to hide in and reproduce and you can have a self-sustaining population

$C: Hey, I'm here from the [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemonstermath/comments/90ct0n/how_many_bottle_caps_of_water_would_it_take_to/) over at r/theydidthemonstermath. 

TL;DR 167,355,047 caps.
$C: Like a pool that's built into the ground. Some have pipes if I'm not mistaken. And filtration systems
$C: I agree with most everything you're saying except that I think you're picking and choosing the variables that go into natural selection in this case. Maybe the gene or learned behavior that facilitates social interaction with humans will prove ultimately beneficial to this species. Many animals have been observed tolerating humans giving them water in times of dire need. Just recall the picture of the koala bear in Australia that barely survived the massive forest fires and uncharacteristically approached the firefighters for water. 

If this interaction proves negative for this little fellow, or his offspring, they won't survive very many generations. Humans can't stop natural selection, since humans are part of nature. We do what we do. To assume otherwise is to believe we're Gods.
$C: Sure, definitionally I'm wrong. But then what's the dividing line? Are simple tools made by apes considered natural? Are beaver dams considered natural? What about the predecessors to homo sapiens? When did they go from doing natural things to unnatural things? 

I'm not arguing that humans should just go and do whatever they want and pillage the environment. However, I do believe that ultimately how we treat the environment is simply reacting to our own best interests, as is everything else we do. 

No, a computer does not meet the dictionary definition of natural, but at its base, it's another tool used to help humans gain an advantage at (acquiring money to) provide food, shelter and protection. I don't think that is wildly different than adaptive traita or simple tools used by other species. 
$C: Thank you! :D
$C: If you were replying to just the OP, why did you reply to anotherusernamelol's comment?

See, it seems to me like you're just trying to save face now, after realising your mistake ;)

$C: He ruined them with each subsequent appearance though.
$C: Yeah, ok. For one thing, it’s absolutely possible the idea was not taken from there, simply that Moffat had 5e same idea independently. For another, it’s not like that’s the only thing. The angels are very different to that SCP, you know. Transformative work was done.
$C: Are you my mummy?
$C: I never thought it was scary, just really sad. :(
$C: I love that they reference it throughout the series too. There was some episode where someone put a gas mask on David Tennant and he asked, "Are you my mummy"? Them like 5-ish seasons later, Peter Capaldi asks the same thing of the mummy in the episode Mummy on the Orient Express.
$C: You might even say the band didn't last forever. 
$C: Oh word? That's friggin sweet as heck.
$C: I was a senior VP at Conglomo
$C: Actually, I'm humans
$C: It's a reason but not a necessity. I don't think any cruelty, harm, etc. happened for no reason, the question is, whether the reason actually justifies the act. Moreover, animal agricultural is harming our planet. So I don't think it's truly irrelevant.

$C: That is the joke, yes
$C: as all things should be
$C: Like the pea soup drinking vegetarian monster he was. 
$C: This is true. One time I repeatedly and deliberately ran over a bunch of ants on the sidewalk. Killed several dozen. I was Ant Hitler of that concrete square.

I felt awful about it later and I still remember it 15 years later.
$C: Lmao 
$C: That's why you leave those in the corner, because none of them can hurt you, and you only remove the actually dangerous ones, which can all survive outside. Note that the original query was in regard to self defense.
$C: So you let bugs live inside your house?
$C: Spiders are chill except the spiders that aren't chill. Black Widows are scary
$C: I'm actually glad to have a few spiders around, especially in the summer. My apartment is on the ground floor by the garden so when it's hot and the windows are open a bunch of these annoying green flies and mosquitoes come in. Anything to help get rid of some is a bonus. 

A spider that goes too close to my bed, sofa or desk however will be escorted out. I only squish blood suckers and pests.
$C: Cockroaches are eaten by mice, rats and birds. Mice and rats are important major sources of food for foxes, weasels, coyotes and even wolves. Roaches might be at bottom of eco system, but are important. Every single thing has a purpose in nature.
$C: I was listening to a radiolab where they talk about a mutant mosquito factory in Brazil that releases mosquitos with a fatal gene into the wild and it pretty much wipes out the native mosquito population.   

Anyway, the one good thing they said about mosquitos is without them, we would probably have effed up all the rainforests a long time ago.   We largely left them alone because it wasn't worth the trouble of them terrible bugs. 
$C: I mean, ants are definitely spreading germs and cockroaches a lot more germs.
$C: /r/spiderbro/top/
$C: Says the person who's house was invaded by spiders,  jk!
$C: I feel like that vinegar/soap/water in a bowl trick is preferable to having spiderwebs in my apartment though
$C: So you are saying if you had a termite infestation and they began to destroy part of your house you would just let them be as long as they don't bite you?
$C: I have literally never had a spider bite me. Mosquitos have bitten me too many times to count. Spiders eat mosquitos. I love spiders. 
$C: Enjoy all your flies and mosquitoes then
$C: See, I cry and panic. But always attempt to rehouse them outside. I made the mistake of using a glass cup to escort a particularly large spider outside once. It keep running up the cup towards my face. It was a 30 minute ordeal. I had to stop and cry because I was panicking a lot. But I finally got him back outside. 
$C: Some orb weavers set up webs on my porch at night; they're pretty chill.

$C: Mosquitoes and ticks suck (heh), but the real problem is what they carry. 
$C: Yeah, wasps don't usually harm anyone that isn't already harming them.


$C: I agree, but it's good to look for other solutions that avoid killing if they're reasonable.A lot of people go straight to killing as their first option. 


Batman does do a lot of good though, even if he doesn't kill anyone for the greater good. Maybe that even has large benefits that are hard to see that actually creates the most life to actually be spared. It's hard to tell sometimes.  
$C: That's an interesting story, but I'm not sure how relevant it is. He didn't kill the maggots or save them. He saved the dog. It wasn't a moral dilemma either since killing the maggots wouldn't save the dog. 
$C: Right! So far we don’t have yellow jackets here (Australia) - I don’t like the large ones here that grotesquely inhabit spiders, (see last par)

$C: Yeah, I can understand that even though I don't necessarily think it's the first action you should take. 
$C: That depends on where you're from, but many people use flies as an example.  


Insects can be annoying or even dangerous, but there are usually other solutions to handle something than to kill it. 
$C: Interesting. I haven't heard that song before and wouldn't have guessed that's what it's talking about. 
$C: lol what? Pick up a book on how ants work.
$C: Uhhhhhh... hmmmm.... OHH!

$C: In Michigan here, my parents get them by their pool. They make a ton of noise at night but stop when you get close. My trick to catching them is use a tree frog sounds app on my phone. 
$C: Yeah, I am going to say we are lucky that the humidity isn't high.  I have been in Key West or Miami when the temp was 90 degrees and 90% humidity where it felt like you were melting and suffocating under the weight of a1000 pound blanket made of hot dog breath.  Yesterday was hot but it was dry heat which I find more tolerable.

Our pool wasn't heated and it was a salt water pool though.

$C: Beauty and the Beast?
$C: Just making sure
$C: My rule is: if I’m outside, I’m in your land, and I leave you be. 

If I’m inside, i allow you to exist if I do not see you. I will leave your webs be. But if I see you, and especially if you’re in attacking distance, you’re going to die. 

And those rules go for spiders as well. 
$C: Black widows only bite if you try to squish them.
$C: Widows are pretty chill, they generally only bite when threatened. I'm not suggesting you keep them in your house or let your kids play with them though.
$C: I have a regal jumping spider who's been living in my apartment since last winter. I noticed she was near the door one day so I cracked it for a few hours to give her the opportunity to leave; she sat in the crack for a while but decided to come back inside.
$C: Keyword nature. I'm not damaging an ecosystem by murdering cockroaches in my home... And even if I am, good. I don't want mice or rats in my house either. Foxes and weasels are bitey and wolves are scary.
$C: So as long as I keep my house roach free I won't have any wolves spawn in my living room? Gotcha.
$C: What about mosquitoes? 
$C: I welcome the jumping spider invasion:) 
$C: of course not, they’re biting my house!
$C: Do you pick weird fights for the challenge? They clearly said self defense was their murder motive. Fucking up ones dwelling is plenty of motive.
$C: tru dat
$C: Same! 

Teaching my toddler how to handle various bugs. I've taught her to wave to spiders and say, "hi spider!" 

The other day her aunt smooshed a spider right in front of her. *While the toddler was talking to it!*
$C: I'm pretty sure the spiders I co-exist with are the source of the tiny bites I sometimes find. They're about 1/1000th as annoying as a mosquito bite, and about 1/100th as annoying as a bad pimple. They itch a little bit and then I forget about them.

I've known a few people who needed to go to the ER over really bad mosquito bites, but I don't personally know anyone who had a spider bite like that. Sure, it happens, but it's rare. At least in my area.

I also know that if a spider did bite me, it was only doing it out of self-defense. I probably rolled onto it when I didn't know it was there. Spiders only bite when threatened. They'd prefer to stay away from us, just like we'd prefer to stay away from them. They don't seek us out to feed on us like mosquitoes.

Even the spiders with more dangerous bites still don't bite unless threatened. I'm not saying that I'd let a brown recluse hang out in my room, because I could accidentally threaten it. But if I see what I think is a dangerous spider outdoors,  I'm just going to stay away from it and let it keep eating mosquitoes and other gross bugs.

I think I have a mild phobia of bugs, but I've still managed to talk myself into seeing spiders this way. It took awhile, but I'm glad I got here. Mostly I just think about how they eat the super gross bugs (which shall remain nameless).
$C: I would if they would stay out of sight, I don't like looking at them, but if they live outside I will reward them with red ants and wasps, two FUCKERS of nature.
$C: I just scoop the spiders up in my hands and carry them outside, unless they're a redback. The redbacks die swiftly.
$C: Fixed thx!
$C: Oh those, thought you were getting serialkillery in here
$C: At least I don’t put him in a burrito
$C: My cats breath smells like cat food.
$C: Free action isn't necessary for meaning to exist.

I submit to the fact that I have little if any control over my situation and that's a huge relief.

I'm just here for the ride, and it's a damn good one.
$C: But they do have a nasty habit of finding some tiny hole to sneak into my house, and then buzzing around a room bumping into everything and generally being noisy while also failing horribly at leaving the way it came in.

Not gonna be easy to remove it without getting stung/bit either, they rarely(from personal experience) sit still in reachable spots to catch em.

Should one still try to remove it without killing it? Or just go for a quicker/easier kill?
$C: I'd have to agree with you as well. 
$C: > No yellow jackets in Australia

Well, that's another reason to look at grad school there, then.
$C: I've never heard of using flies as an example.

I'm Australians...flies warm here. It's a joke that we don't enunciate very much in order to prevent us from swallowing flies. Every house has a fly swat.

I always take insects outside myself though.
$C: Glad I could help.
$C: You said "that's literally how ants works".  I literally quoted myself l, and it doesn't make sense.  I don't think you actually know how ants work.  
$C: As a toad, I'm  outraged
$C: take it back
$C: Yeah I went to Disney world for July 4th a few years back and it was miserable. The humidity was suffocating. We bought multiple fan misters and still stopped at various shops every 30 minutes or so to get some AC
$C: I highly suggest taking advantage of your state parks. They're gorgeous, well-maintained, and have great options for day-hikes or for camping. And they're affordable. I forget what exactly I paid for a week's worth of camping at Wyalusing, but it was way less than what I expected based on my camping experiences in other state's parks. If camping isn't your thing, I get it, but there are a ton of great hiking trails, there's great fishing in that area if you like that, and there are so many great spots for photos. I only brought my cell phone with me, and I really regretted I didn't bring my good camera because there was so much beauty to photograph all around me. On the other hand, the camera bag would have been a bitch to lug around on some of the trails - the various lenses can be heavy - so maybe it's a good thing I only brought my phone haha.
$C: It's a region of Southwest Wisconsin (and adjoining parts of Iowa and Minnesota) that was unglaciated in the last ice age. It means no glaciers slid over that land, flattening it out like they did elsewhere. So it has really cool topography with ancient rock formations, bluffs, valleys and such. Makes for great hiking, great motorcycling, fantastic views, and small- scale organic farming. It's a really special little part of the upper Midwest that not a lot of people know about.
$C: They are. I had a few in an omelette before work this morning. My best find was a bandage wrapped Cabot Gouda. We get Cabot down here but nothing on that quality range.
$C: No, but I do have some very close friends in GA. They have it even worse than I do, I think. Though they're moving into the mountains, where it'll be a bit cooler, soon so maybe they'll have it better than me come September.

Really, most of the American South is just miserably hot and humid for far too much of the year. And it's only getting worse as time goes on.
$C: My money is on Missouri. 
$C: Oh that is such a good policy! Thanks for the link!
$C: Well in that case, cheers to the environment!
$C: The plants will naturally help filter water. I am curious though how the algae build up is? Does the council pay for filtration system? Most home ponds in the US have a skimmer and biomass filters to my knowledge which help keep the water clear for viewing purposes as well as keeping the water cycle (Ammonia, Nitrite, Nitrates) in check. Austrailia also has some very cool turtle species that would probably love your pool pond if you wanted to add a couple extra guests! There might be some eaten fishies though if they can fit in the turtle's mouth.
$C: Right, what is your point other than you know the definition from the dictionary? How does that affect the analysis of the concept? 
$C: I mean Moffat’s not exactly the most popular guy with a lot of Doctor Who fans anymore. General idea is that he’s a great writer for individual stories, but he was lousy at trying to put together a series.

In general though, the Weeping Angels are one of the most popular Who villains, likely the most popular of New Who, so someone saying “oh, it’s been stolen from here” (I know that’s not what you said, and not what you meant, but unfortunately it’s kind of what it looks like) isn’t going to go down well. It’s a good point, I had wondered which came first when I saw that SCP for the first time.
$C: Donna Noble has left the library. Donna Noble has been saved.

$C: You don't need meat to get sufficient amounts of protein or iron. There have been plenty of studies stating the health benefits of a fully plant-based diet but it does seem like you can be almost as healthy if you consume a mostly plant-based diet with small amounts of animal products, I'm gonna give you that. But bottom line is, you don't need to eat meat. Legumes have plenty of (complete) proteins and iron in them. So just have some with Vitamin C rich vegetables for increased absorption and you're sorted. There are of course some very rare cases in which people are allergic to all legumes and grains - for those I can see the necessity, but otherwise not.

$C: yeah I just moved to a new house and my water is way worse than my last house ): And I'm apparently the only one with a good/acute sense of smell because I'm the only one in my family that thinks that. It also tastes terrible too. Both out of the sink's faucet and in the shower. I hate it so much. My last house had nasty 'wet-dog' smelling tap water in the kitchen, but at least the bathroom and the shower were just fine. Like, you could drink from the last two. At my new house, I wouldn't even THINK of doing that >~< So, basically I have to really use a bunch of nice smelling body wash, plus scented lotion and "fragrance mist". Otherwise I probably wouldn't smell so great. I can't put my finger on what the water of my new house smells/tastes like, but it's not 100% clean, I know that. WATER IS NOT SUPPOSED TO SMELL!

$C: Oh, shit!
$C: In addition to this rule, I have the "i tried to kill you once and failed, now I must help you outside for it was meant to be" code
$C: I once had an agreement with the spiders in my garage, as long as I didn't get attacked (especially while driving) I was cool with them.

Then one bit me & I got blood poisoning, we weren't friends anymore after the skin on my hand turned black. Now all spiders must die. 
$C: That’s a good rule
$C: If they're just chilling in their web, I don't bother them. And jumping spiders are really cute and hide a lot so I don't bother them
$C: You could do that accidentally though. Maybe they are in your shoe or bed sheets. I had a spider hiding in a bath towel. 
$C: Aww, those are cute!
$C: You are going to concert
$C: Bats eat mosquitoes. Bats are pretty cool. 


$C: Small birds eat mosquitoes. Wrens and other birds like wrens will fly fast, with their beaks slightly open, catching numerous mosquitoes, then clamp their beaks shut and bring them back to distribute among their babies. If the mosquitoes go, the small birds go. If the small birds go...and on, and on and on...impact is almost always UP the foodchain when you stop to think about it.
$C: If you can establish an understanding with the ants they will keep fleas away. Thats how it works in my yard. Dont come past this line and i wont nuke your ant hill. Also, no fireant hills where my dog can get into them. In exchange, all you can eat yard buffet. My dog hasnt had fleas in 2 years. It is my understanding that they like to eat the flea eggs.

Growing up my moms house had a tendency to get piss ants annually. I let a couple of spiders set up shop in my room in areas i wouldnt be in (upper corner at the ceiling for example). My room was one of the few you would never see an ant in and it shared a wall with the kitchen.

https://www.existentialbuddhist.com/2010/09/on-not-killing/


>And what of harmful pests: bed bugs, fleas, flies, mosquitoes, cockroaches, fire ants, and rodents?  Is one permitted to rid one’s home and neighborhood of them, or must one endure them, even when they are unsanitary or serve as a vector for serious infectious disease?

>And what about bacteria and internal parasites?  Is one permitted to use antibiotics?

>And what about the autoimmune system? Doesn’t the autoimmune system kill foreign living organisms all the time?

>And what about killing in self-defense or to protect one’s family, neighbors or countrymen?

>To complicate matters further, Mahayana Buddhism introduces the concept of “skillful means” (upaya kausalya).  Under certain circumstances one may violate precepts when one’s motivation is wholesome.

I look at it that it's okay if it's necessary, but if you can reasonably find a way to fix the solution without killing a living thing you probably should. This is obviously not a settled debate and I'm not exactly sure where I stand on it. 

$C: Chemical signals that are often compared to how packets work on a network. Like I said , pick up a book on ants instead of looking like an asshole.
$C: Sorry, but you're all horny.
$C: We need a longer thread about frog sex.
$C: I will definitely have to check Wyalusing
$C: Check out Sartori cheese. Some of the best fine cheese you'll ever have. They have two plants, one in my hometown. They export world wide
$C: WOO the ENVIRONMENT!!!

Luckily we have a creek nearby and some amount of remnant bush, so the neighbours can't really complain.

It's a nice peaceful sound, a combination of wood blocks and sliding noises and pluckings...hard to describe. So it's fairly loud, but it's natural and blends in.
$C: Bacteria and plants should do a fine job of keeping parameters in check so long as its appropriately stocked. If you planned to swim in it still though I'd want some water movement just to break the protein on the surface and make it more inviting. 
$C: > Most home ponds in the US have a skimmer and biomass filters

Huh, never encountered any of these. We constructed a few ponds (father ran a landscaping business) including a natural greywater treatment system.
$C: > General idea is that he’s a great writer for individual stories, but he was lousy at trying to put together a series.

Add in that he has a lot of bad tropes he always leans on and an annoying tendency to write really good first parts of two-parters with disappointing second parts.

I'd still take him over RTD's fanfiction writing in a lot of cases though

$C: Where... do you guys get your tap water from then? Oh god. 
$C: Sounds like maybe nasty buildup in the waterlines? Also, you probably shouldnt drink water that goes to the hotwater tank first (if youre drinking it in the shower? Depending on how old the pipes are.) Bad shit mang. 
$C: why you babysitting only 2 or 3 shots, I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch. First you get a swimmin pool fulla liquor then you *diiive* in it. Pool fulla liquor then you dive in it

$C: Small birds don't eat mosquitos exclusively. I'm fairly certain they'd be fine.
$C: Possums eat them too.

Edit: Never mind. They eat ticks.
$C: It’s certainly an excuse to forgive others and myself for doing shitty things. 

I don’t have any ill will towards any other human being and I would very much have to be in an altered state of consciousness or experience a traumatic paradigm shift to intentionally hurt someone else.

Aside from harming someone else, the list of objectively shitty things is pretty short. 
$C: Spiders are bros, and even dangerous ones are usually not going to go out of their way to bite. Yellow jackets aren't bad because of their appearance or toxicity, they're bad because those stripy lunatics sometimes sting with little to no provocation.
$C: ...I was referring to your statement about ants being lesser than other species, but whatever 
$C: Absolutely will do!
$C: if the pond had a waterfall in it, that would have helped with protein buildup by circulating the water a little better. it could still get a layer on top, but with the surface being broken it would be less obvious
$C: Maybe I’m just biased cos RTD was my first exposure to Doctor Who, but I liked his style. For the most part. Yeah ok, there was still a lot of crap, wasn’t there?
$C: I was in 5th grade when THAT song came out.

$C: yeah I doubt they care, but I'll see if they can try to get them cleaned somehow... But yeah I was drinking the cold water at my old place, is that still bad? I never got sick or anything from it and it was only rarely and also not a lot at a time when I did. I mostly did it if it was early in the morning and I was super thirsty or had just got home after doing tiring, dehydrating things

All the girls wanna play Baywatch

I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they diiiiiiiive in it

Pool full of liquor I'mma diiiiiiive in it
$C: Here I go again.
$C: If I was judging people in some kind of an afterlife I'd agree with you, but here damaging actions have to be met with a reaction to make things better even if no one is truly morally at fault. 


Looking at it that way the focus should be on rehabilitation and stopping further harm instead of revenge or punishment. You should never just let things go though. 
$C: Comparing the processing capabilities, I don’t think anyone’s going to argue that ants can process complex thought or emotion. They are really one of the most interesting creatures and how they operate almost exactly like a network. 
$C: Please let me know what you think!
$C: I was a longtime fan of Classic Who prior to 2005.

I think part of my frustration comes with a lot of people who love RTD era Doctor Who and only RTD era Doctor Who. He has a style of his own, and it's not really terrible, but it's nowhere near the perfection that his fans make it out to be.

I don't begrudge fans for liking it, I just get frustrated that so many people act like it's the best and definitive Doctor Who, when in reality it's from an era of utter ridiculousness half the time, it rips canon to shreds especially with very poorly attempts to entirely recreate established characters (like the Master, who RTD never wrote. He wrote a giggling hybrid of the Riddler and Skeletor who only shared the name of The Master), a lot of the characters are often written as total assholes with a whole bunch of moral dissonance, especially the 10th Doctor. And most frustrating of all is how much of the best of the RTD era came from other sources. The best Dalek episode of New Who, Dalek? An adaption of the pre-existing 6th Doctor story 'Jubilee'. The Age of Steel two parter? A worse adaption of the 5th Doctor's 'Spare Parts' story. Human Nature, not even really an adaption, but rather just remaking a 7th Doctor story with the 10th Doctor, even has the same name. The Judoon? A lazy rip off of Ogrons. The Ood? Lazy rip off of Sensorites. Slitheen? Lazy rip off of Foamasi. The Beast? Lazy rip off of Sutekh (even had the same voice actor).

It just bugs me that the RTD era is held up to such high esteem, and RTD gets so much credit for an era that has so many glaring problems, and where much of the credit for the best work belongs with other people, yet other eras of Doctor Who get absolutely lambasted for the same stuff.

I'd also just note, I'm not going to even start with my inevitable rant about RTD and his bitchy whining about 'the wrong kind of fans' in 'Love and Monsters'

But yeah, there's my obnoxiously long rant because frankly I care way too much about this and I'm a sad loser with no life.
$C: I was 15. 
$C: Meh.  I feel like you can watch the opening sequence and pretty much get the gist.  The humor is otherwise a bit broad for my tastes.
$C: Christ!! Is all of America a fucking garbage fire?! That's awful.  No money for infrastructure to help working people and all the money for corporate handouts. Maaann
:(
$C: One could, and I would, argue that the ability to process complex emotion and thought are not how we measure value of life.  
$C: No worries. I do get your complaints, and honestly I’ve found a lot of complaints from Classic Who fans are because of the way the Doctor’s personality and canon have been changed.

I didn’t know about all those episodes being rip-offs, though I did vaguely know that the Master used to be a lot more foreboding and subtle.

In fairness to RTD, he brought Doctor Who back. Part of that was his writing, warts and all. It was silly, and ridiculous, but for me at least, that’s part of the fun of it. And at least he could do decent series storylines.

And Jesus, Love and Monsters. Not only does it have that problem, but the monster at the end is just ridiculous. I know why it’s like that, but I still think it should never have happened.
$C: My water comes from the local lake. It's not super pure or anything, you can still taste the "lakey" minerals, but it's totally fine.
$C: Whose valuing life? What’s wrong with you? 

If you kill an ant it’s not going to have a sustained effect on anyone, they exist as workers to search out food and bring it back. When one goes down another comes looking to better understand what’s out there for the entire unit, which is why you shouldn’t kill them and throw them in a trash can if you want to keep them out of your house. You shouldn’t feel bad about killing insects, slippery slope fallacies are fallacies.  They will be just fine, long after we kill ourselves. I don’t know what your lesser or greater nonsense is about, they are just simply a different organism , you can’t worry about the deaths of insects anymore than the death of a protozoa.

There’s more ants in the world than people, and there’s a lot of us..

When it comes to ticks and mosquitos, kill them all.
$C: This is true. I may have a ton of complaints, but RTD did bring Doctor Who back, and without him we wouldn't have all the great stuff we've had in the last thirteen years. Be it the parts of his era that genuinely deserve credit like Blink or Midnight, or stuff from the Moffat era like the entire Capaldi Doctor, World Enough and Time and episodes like Flatline and Mummy on the Orient Express that are up there among my favourites ever

And he could definitely do decent series storylines, and it's not like he's terrible and all other showrunners were fantastic, I could rant about Moffat or John Nathan-Turner for just as long, just neither of them gets quite as deified as RTD by certain subsets of fans.

I also wanna note that I do really like RTD as a writer on other non-Doctor Who projects, I think when he's more restrained by the setting he does better work, and when he doesn't have this strange mindset that Doctor Who has to be a certain way or it will fail.

Plus he did give us The Sarah Jane Adventures which is by far the best Doctor Who spinoff ever (Torchwood on the other hand.... well...)
