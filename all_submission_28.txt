Tower: "No, Eiffel"
$C: Go home, Eiffel Tower. You're drunk.
$C: It must be really hot there

$C: "Ooooh bitch, hold my earrings!" Is how I'm viewing this picture lol
$C: The panorama setting includes some computer vision code, I'm assuming it looks for vertical and horizontal lines and tries to keep them that way when knitting the image. I guess the angle is close enough in the middle, but then as it gets higher the code decides that the lines aren't actually vertical. There could be a whole class of cool images here: try the big electrical pilons.

One day some of his relatives plan to visit their city, so his mother advised him that whenever she tells him to "close the Eiffel Tower", it means that he has to close his zipper.
His relatives arrive, and after some time, the boy asked his aunti, "Aunti, why did you come here?"
His aunti answered, "Dear boy, we came here to see the Eiffel Tower."
The boy said in great excitement, pointing towards his zipper, "But aunti, the Eiffel Tower is closed."
Aunti replied, "My boy, that is the small Eiffel Tower. I came here to see big one."
The boy answered politely, "Aunti, then I will have to call my dad!‚Äù

$C: Ah shit my neck you fuckin motherfuckin bastard
$C: Man even the eiffel tower is getting in on the harlem shake now.
$C: ***Erffel Terwer***
$C: Can anyone explain how/why this turned out the way it did? I'm so confused. A panaromic shot I thought was a collection of multiple shots to create a panorama, why does the tower look completely connected and yet all bendy
$C: I would visit Paris if it looked like this... j/s nice pic

$C: OMG!
$C: How bad is the migrant situation in Paris right now? Have you noticed
$C: Those fences are to keep migrants out
$C: Eiffel tower gettin' sassy. Ah oui oui
$C: The French government would like to have a word with you. In court. 
  
They own the rights to the Eiffel Tower, including all images, reproductions, and pictures
$C: Wait is this Paris ? Cuz I'm pretty sure there is no grass under the tower... 
$C: *Bonjour* everyone! Don't worry. Everything is *bon*! We stopped the terrorists.
$C: That‚Äôs super cool!
$C: This is not a war joke is it, How easily they folded? 
$C: Perfectly represents the condition of France ever since the refugees started pouring in
$C: This made me realize that we need a Escher filter for cameras!
$C: You know, when you said we were gonna make "the wobbly Eiffel tower" this wasn't what I had in mind. 
$C: This is the dancing tower they used to sell at Spencer‚Äôs!
$C: Who pissed off Magneto?

$C: He's been trying to get ahold of it alot for awhile now.
$C: Looks like it‚Äôs about to go Whomping Willow all up in this bitch
$C: Not enough clocks
$C: You could say that about a lot of content in r/AccidentalSurrealism 
$C: Or Magneto. 
$C: Either that, or the tower has been hanging out with the Burning Giraffe too much.
$C: Now someone make a panoramic of a Dali painting.
$C: You forgot to say "haha only art history majors will get this"
$C: Or Dr Seuss 
$C: Or Tim Burton.

$C: Or Magneto, possibly.
$C: It looks like the iron giant grabbed it. 
$C: Or Frank Gehry
$C: Having just gone to the Dali museum this weekend, that's pretty much the first thing I said to my husband when I saw this. Then I came to the comments and this was the top one. Great minds...üòâ
$C: Or it turned into a robot
$C: Global warming is hitting it hard.
$C: Creative Photoshopping!

&#x200B;
$C: Looks like ISIS got ahold of it 
$C: More like Willy Vandersteen in the Suske en Wiske album De Sputterende Spuiter. Looks exactly like the Eiffel Tower coming to life in the comic.

I'm bashing my head in because I can't find a picture online and the comic is at my parents' house.
$C: My exact thiughts
$C: It looks fed up and about to walk away
$C: He‚Äôll probably call it something like, ‚ÄúTower of Eiffel from that dream I had not to long ago but still scarcely  remember...‚Äù
$C: Was looking for this 
$C: Agreed.

$C: Sweet D would copy those moves.

$C: My dick...
$C: I gave it a quick try https://i.imgur.com/ZVJlRUS.jpg
$C: [I tried to fix it](https://i.imgur.com/9ITQVsC.jpg)
$C: It'd probably be easier to recreate it with a better quality original image that hasn't been distorted. Or to get a 3D model of the tower (I'm sure there's some super realistic one floating around) and to do it that way.
$C: [i gave it a try, hope u like :D](https://i.imgur.com/2NMD7sB.jpg)
$C: It wasn't easy but I think [it came out pretty good](https://i.imgur.com/Yep1grR.jpg).
$C: [Here.](https://i.imgur.com/LQ3qURx.jpg)

This is 95% me going to town with the smudge tool, still I believe it came out pretty nice. I went extra from what you originally asked, but since you said it had the potential to resemble art, plus one other dude above mentioned Dali, I decided to go that way.

To be honest just smoothing out the edges wouldn't really make much of a difference.
$C: I'll do it tommorow
$C: I gottchu. Give me a couple of days. 
$C: [Sorry it took so long, I spent about 2 hours smoothing out all the rough edges from the panoramic. ](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) 
$C: i started to do this but then i started drinking and forgot. maybe i will share in the morning. i couldn‚Äôt figure out the bottom left. 
$C: Done! I did a few thousand variations so you can pick your favorite. Just Google image search "Eiffel Tower" to see!
$C: [Took a while, but here is my best shot](https://i.imgur.com/R390EId.jpg)
$C: RemindMe! 2 days
$C: I want to see someone make it into an Eiffel Tower monster 
$C: Right? I feel like this could be worth something

Could totally see this in a surrealist exhibit. 
$C: Can we get a photoshop wizard to make it straight again?
$C: https://imgur.com/gallery/t8QIlRj
$C: I have been called.
$C: I can do it! Gonna need a couples months though 
$C: What do you mean when you say ‚Äúsmooth out‚Äù? Like the lower legs, there‚Äôs a lot of random lines etc, so I assume you want that cleaned up? Lines straightened too? 

I‚Äôm afraid that whatever I‚Äôd do to this photo to ‚Äúsmooth it out‚Äù would only detract from the artistic quality created by the glitch

‚ÄúFixing/smoothing‚Äù this piece kinda feels like being presented with a pollock and being asked to smooth that out, I mean, you could and it would probably look presentable, but you killed something in the proces, imo


Ignore this, that‚Äôs just what my lazy ass tells myself as an excuse to not even get started with it
$C: Louvre it! A real Triomphe.

$C: I went looking for this comment. I did not leave disappointed.
$C: It really is. Can confirm. I am currently here on what we thought was our autumn Honeymoon but it is full on summer here this week. No complaints, it is fantastic!

$C: Checkmate, global warming skeptics!
$C: r/subsyoufellfor
$C: Can confirm, I was just there last week and it was not green, and most of it wasn't even grass.
$C: Also, isnt there the big ugly metal sheet wall around it now?
$C: Shenanigans!
$C: Exactly my thought. When I went there I was suprised how fucked up the ground is there. 
$C: Came here to say this, got engaged here very recently and the ground is just dirt. This isn't a recent picture. 
$C: Also not one single rat in the picture. 
$C: Also, there‚Äôs not grass under it. It‚Äôs concrete.
$C: Also, the way the tower is twisted, it seems almost intentionally made that way, because how hard is it to tilt your phone up slowly?
$C: this was actually taken at the Paris hotels and casino at Las Vegas
$C: I don't know what to believe

$C: Where's the proof? 
$C: Agreed. And no lines waiting to take the elevators/lifts. Kind of ruins it. 
$C: This same image was posted a few days ago also

$C: Really I say on some beautiful green grass and it all looked great last time I was there a year ago
$C: French gov: ‚ÄúYo NASA, we need your help to redirect a meteor to hit the Eiffel Tower. You in?‚Äù

NASA: ‚Äúwe‚Äôre on it‚Äù
$C: Easy. We just attach a chain to the top and convince OP's mom to swing from it.
$C: oh sure
$C: Just melt them a little with some jet fuel.
$C: No, but we can figuratively do it.
$C: reminds me of Soaring over the World at Disney.  I always assumed it was the fishbowl screen making the Eiffel bend, Disney ahead of the game.

$C: You're hired! 
$C: Ah yes, The Bent Tower of Pisa. My favorite landmark!
$C: Yeah he had to tilt the screen pretty much while camera was taking shots I doubt anyone would do that if wanted to take normal panorama
$C: There's nothing in the title to imply it wasn't deliberate. He even said it went surprisingly well. I take that to mean he wasn't sure if his attempt at a curvy panorama would work out, and was pleased when he got the result he was looking for.
$C: Have I misunderstood what panoramic meant my whole life?!?
$C: Nah, he just took the picture on accident
$C: Tilt phone while moving it
$C: He never said he didn't meant to do this, he even said it went surprisingly well. 
$C: It‚Äôd be kind of neat to see other landmarks in this style!
$C: Let‚Äôs do it Reddit (I don‚Äôt have fb)
$C: yeah as if this was not done on purpose...
$C: Global warming sure is a bitch
$C: 24¬∞C in October is weird
$C: if yours flaccid look like this, mate you need to see a doctor üò∑

$C: Eh. I used it for a big tree. 
$C: Username checks out

$C: Obviously that's why it didn't work properly. Garsh.
$C: Lmao
$C: They turned the camera so that the shot was deliberately messed up. 
$C: Lmao. Life here in Paris is exactly as it ever was.
$C: Yawn. Is that all you robots are programmed to say?
$C: Hence the fence.
$C: France lost 1.4 million soldiers during WWI, with one in twenty of the entire population dying. More than 4.3 million were wounded. When WW2 came around and they were again on the front lines, they had some hard choices to make.

So, kindly piss off with that ignorant swill about the French surrendering. 
$C: The French have kicked a whole lot of ass over the centuries. This ignorant shit just makes you look dumb.
$C: No one expected German to revolutionize warfare in the manner they did. When they rolled out in WWII with modernized tanks, planes , machie guns, and submarines, many countries were still using flipping horses and thinking trench warfare was viable. Also Hitler just drove around the French defensive line thru a forest that most thought impassable. 

France however has been around for longer than most nations on Earth. They held their own for a very long time.

This video shows how long France held it's borders when the whole of Europe changed hands countless times.

$C: I like all the other reply. "Cant be done" "shouldn't be don't" "pollock" etc. While you are here with it looking perfect after "a quick try". Good job.

$C: Yes I fell for her, she is beautiful beyond compare, lovely lady and sexy beyond imagination. Nothing else will do or nothing can compare. So I'm stuck in deep thought
$C: Don't forget people in picnic mats and lots of vendors!
$C: One euro?
$C: Wall nothing. Some asshole took this perfectly good lawn and put a giant fucking erector set on it!
$C: This isnt directly under it. Look at the perspective again.
$C: Congratulations on your engagement!
$C: This was taken from the southeastern face of the tower, on the Champ de Mars. Due to perspective, it appears as though the grass is underneath the tower, but if you look closely you can see the perimeter fence and security checkpoints. 
$C: NASA: "We've been planning for this day since our inception. All of mankind's science and space efforts have lead us to this moment.".

$C: Saudi Arabia could crash a plane into it, they could really use the brownie points right now.

...I‚Äôm so, so sorry.
$C: Why not skip the third party and just have the ESA do it?
$C: ‚ÄúSay no more fam‚Äù
$C: ‚ÄúThe Eiffel Tower‚Äôs been that way since it was created, you‚Äôre just seeing it now because the TARDIS bypassed the perception filter. It‚Äôs built in such a way that it catches just the right frequencies, and distributes them at just the right angle to...‚Äù

(Sonic buzzing, portal appears in the arch at the base of the tower)

‚ÄúRip open a huge quantum tunnel! But, you see, if you built something this strange in the middle of Paris, people would start asking questions, start poking around. And they can‚Äôt have that, so they pop on a perception filter, and boom, Eiffel Tower.   
‚ÄúBut a tunnel this big, this distance... what could possibly want to travel through here?‚Äù

(Sorry, I know no one asked for this, but it seemed like fun)
$C: \>Episode of Doctor Who.

\>Set on Earth but not in Britain.

Not Bloody Likely!


$C: Actually the Tower is not built upon a straight leaning line but on a series of segments of similar but not equal slopes

$C: Is this how you'd replicate this? I'd love to try it myself
$C: Could have tripped maybe? Either way, I like it. 
$C: Well panorama has a definition and i dont think this picture fits that definition. But yeah maybe he just clicked the panorama button so in that sense yes i suppose its still an accurate statement. Maybe thats what he meant.

$C: He said he ‚Äútried to take a panoramic picture‚Äù, the results suggest otherwise.

$C: Make it even better :p
$C: Make it look like it‚Äôs fighting Godzilla

i did it on my phone so it‚Äôs a bit bad
$C: I totally agree! Smoothing it out on a pic that is clearly taken with a phone would look much better and more surreal than a professional photo taken with a camera. The look is really distinct imo
$C: I mean, it is... He photoshopped it.
$C: Yo tower's so fat it makes the earth buckle.

$C: Duuuude I scared the shit out of my wife this summer at the Eiffel tower. We were having a picnic and I went to use the restroom, and when I came back I snuck up on her and got real close and said "One euro?" Right in her ear. Scared her half to death. 
$C: *waves around disco laser pointer while taking drag of cigarette*
$C: I didn't say it was directly under it, but the grass area pictured, is, at the moment pounded into oblivion, so unless the grass has miraculously recovered, this isn't recent. Theres also a ton of metal iron grates up round it, due to the terror level in france, these dont appear in the photo. 
$C: Thanks!! :D 
$C: Yep, based on the bushes to the right it looks like [the photographer was standing right about where the marker is in this map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/48%C2%B051'26.9%22N+2%C2%B017'44.6%22E/@48.857474,2.2948749,234m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m13!1m6!3m5!1s0x47e66e2964e34e2d:0x8ddca9ee380ef7e0!2sEiffel+Tower!8m2!3d48.8583701!4d2.2944813!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d48.8574743!4d2.2957305).


$C: Yeah, it definitely looks like the grass ends at or near the end of the closer tower legs, but is not directly over it

Edit: Just looked it up on Google Maps too, looks like there's plenty of [grass surrounding it] (https://maps.google.com/?cid=10222232094831998944)
$C: SPACE FORCE GO!
$C: I imagined Doctor 10 saying this, Good Times.
$C: But if there was an episode set in France, there is a 90% chance it would involve either the Eiffel Tower or the Louvre.
$C: I *think* it's more likely a result of the stitching software getting confused. Panorama software looks for consistent elements like edges, straight lines, similar shades etc upon which to stitch the images together - and the Tower is simply filled with confounding elements - lines that are not 100% straight. Edges and lines that look like reasonable matches all over the place - it's a very confusing image for stitching software to have to work out on the fly.

Then toss in a little unaccounted for camera twist (mostly this is already measured by your phone's gyros so as to not be a big deal) and voila - crazy image like this one.
$C: My phone will absolutely do this if I pan "wrong," but it takes some effort to get it to turn out this smooth.
$C: I'm pretty sure that's exactly what he meant, and you just wanted to find a problem
$C: Maybe he tripped?

"I think your data is out of date.  Here's blah blah' university's current guidelines."

"This is . . . .  Can I keep this?"

$C: "...Many men wake up with a powerful, proud erection, the intensity of which also acts as a first anchor to the world during the transition from sleep to wakefulness.

They don‚Äôt have that gentle Charon to mark out the road from one world to the other."

Some are sexual, some occur during

But there's a mysterious third kind

$C: Charon? 
$C: Oh, that would have been good.
$C: same in French but Mort de rire
$C: It also means morte de rire (dead of laughter) in French, so it was a 50/50 shot
$C: It has the same meaning in french MDR : "Mort de Rire". That's part of why the Esperanto is pretty easy to learn!
$C: /r/unexpectedtheoffice
$C: In Roman mythology, Charon is the boatman who takes you to the underworld on the river Styx after you die. So he's like a guide between different worlds.
$C: It's not the same meaning. Multoj is "many"
$C: Translation is an art. The aim is to translate the idea, not a construction of words !

But yes, Multoj is many/a lot ^^
