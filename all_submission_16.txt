Update: We won the Net Neutrality vote in the Senate!
We did it, Reddit! 

Today, [the US Senate voted 52\-47](https://www.wired.com/story/senate-approves-measure-to-save-net-neutrality) to restore Net Neutrality! While this measure must now go through the House of Representatives and then the White House in order for the rules to be fully restored, this is still an incredibly important step in that process—one that could not have happened without all your phone calls, emails, and [other activism](https://redditblog.com/2017/12/11/an-analysis-of-net-neutrality-activism-on-reddit/). The [evidence](http://www.publicconsultation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Net_Neutrality_II_Slides_041818.pdf) is clear that Net Neutrality is important to Americans of both parties \(or no party at all\), and today’s vote demonstrated that our Senators are hearing us.

We’ve still got a way to go, but today’s vote has provided us with some incredible momentum and energy to keep fighting. 

We’re going to keep working with you all on this in the coming months, but for now, we just wanted to say thanks!
$C: Will you be making another thread for the House vote as well?

$C: >That survey found that **after the issue was explained to them**, 83 percent of respondents, including 89 percent of Democrats and 75 percent of Republicans, favored keeping the Obama-era rules.

lmao. key wording bolded.
$C: Remember that in a few months we're going to have to repeat the cycle because of the 47 people on the senate who voted no.

Something something win the battle, but the war's long from over :(
$C: I'm not in the US but have been following this issue somewhat (hard not to with it being all over reddit!). But 52-47 sounds incredibly close, which makes me think that without the help of people here that would be a very different result. I know that if it had went the other way it would affect more than just people in the US but in a lot of other places too, so thanks everyone who put time / effort into this whole thing.

Edit: okay glad to hear that 52-47 isnt as close as i initially thought
$C: > Trump is known to change his mind from time to time

Understatement of the year folks.
$C: This is a big win for us all, but we have to remember to still stay vigilant in the future, this will likely be a fight for years to come.
$C: Is there a good chance the Republican House and Trump will sign off on this? 
$C: there's the house to go through

and trump

hopefully politicians finally get it through their heads that the public wants this
$C: >We did it, Reddit!


*WAR FLASHBACKS*
$C: Eat shit Ajit

\*drinks from an even larger Reese's mug
$C: This is great, but there aren't the votes in the House to pass the measure, which would be the next step.  What's the plan going forward?  Is there a realistic expectation that the House will pass the measure and that POTUS will sign it?  What does the vote count look like right now?

$C: Just messaged my congressman: “I know folks are in the midst of celebrating the win for net neutrality but I know that there’s a long and difficult road ahead. The road leads through the offices of you and your colleagues. I pray that you and others will consider how important equal and unrestricted access to the information superhighway is. How much do you trust your cable provider? Do you truly believe that they and other market players will act to the benefit of the people? If we as consumers had choices, perhaps things would be different. I consider myself blessed to have access to a local fiber based system. Others are not so fortunate. The Cox, ATTs and DirecTVs of the world will always and forever act only in their best interests. Not long ago, you were paying your phone bill by the minute. That rapidly changed to an unlimited plan. Do you think it cost more to maintain the network then than it does now? There’s the difference: an unregulated market works when the consumer has a choice. I know that it’s unlikely you’ll read this message but if people like me remain silent, you’ll only hear the loudest and stupidest of your constituents. If you ever want to meet wth me, I’ll buy the coffee.”
$C: It is terrifying the amount of energy it takes us to overtake these issues, and these are just the ones we happen to be passionate about.   

But, having been to city municipal meetings a few times, it makes sense that politicians instantly discount the plebs.  It must be infuriating to interact with the unwashed masses.  Well dressed, scotch\-buying lobbyists with a checkbook must be extremely hard to ignore.
$C: Don’t even worry about a veto, this will never get to the House floor for a vote. It got to a floor vote in the senate via a discharge petition. A discharge petition is a tool where if you get enough senators to support a measure, it bypasses the committee of jurisdiction and goes right to the floor. Once it passes the senate, the measure is than sent to the House of Representative where it is held at the desk, per statute. So since it’s at the desk in the House, there is no way to get a floor vote unless the majority party schedules it. A discharge petition doesn’t apply in the House because it’s not referred to a house committee, it will just sit at the desk. 


$C: Midterm elections are coming up. Look up the 47 who voted no and see if you can vote against them
$C: Ajit Pai is probably too busy with a mouth full of corporate cock to comment about this. 
$C: its not over!!!! make sure you call your representative to tell them too!!!
$C: All thanks to our gracious Chancellor Palp- I mean, the Senate!
$C: Thank the Democrats! Every single one of them voted in favor of Net Neutrality. And no duh, this issue has 83% popularity in the USA. Yet 94% of Republicans opposed it. It will be an uphill battle in the House, but it shouldn't be. 

Just try to convince me there's no difference.
$C: My dad was so brainwashed, that he believed the issue reversed. He thinks that the liberals keep pushing net neutrality to raise his internet bill. Just to give everyone perspective on why this issue isn't voted to oblivion. Keep informing everyone you know!
$C: Remember when you go to the polls:

49/49 Democrats voted for net neutrality 

3/51 Republicans voted for net neutrality
$C: > and today’s vote demonstrated that our Senators are hearing us

Well, the Dems and 3 Republicans in your Senate. The other 47 Republicans don’t give a fuck about you no matter what
$C: r/prematurecelebration
$C: If reddit simply banded with other major sites and refused to serve their site up to any ISP that throttled sites then it would be over.  Wouldn’t take all the sites,  just like 50 large ones.  No google, amazon, Facebook, Netflix, Hulu, etc and bam no more net neutrality issue.
$C: And it had absolutely nothing to do with the barrage of posts on every fucking subreddit, a few months ago.
$C: Celebrate tonight and tomorrow repair the fortifications.  They will be back, and in greater numbers.
$C: Ok you guys really need to quit touting this as the greatest WIN. This isn't a WIN, it is the first step. You need to be letting people know that the fight is still on and that they now need to be blowing up their house reps phones.
$C: I didn’t know we were going to be pushing politics.
$C: > We did it, Reddit!

I wouldn't use that wording, but yay! 
$C: I'm typically all in for deregulation, but it this case I'm not. 

Ending net neutrality gives us the worst of both worlds. We still have anti competition laws that enforce monopolies and duopolies while giving ISPs the freedom to enact anti consumer practices. Ideally I could just switch providers if I didn't like what my current one was doing, but I only have one choice for fast Internet in my area.

Combine this with the fact that the barrier to entry in the ISP market is too high to allow for real competition except for between a handful of giant companies. 

In today's day and age, the Internet is just as crucial to our standard of living as electricity is. It should be regulated like a utility.
$C: *The Democrats (and 3 Republicans) of the Senate have voted to restore Net Neutrality. 

Don't give credit where it isn't due. This is the literal definition of a partisan issue, and the Republicans will vote against it en masse due to their selfish interests.

The "both parties are the same" argument is as dumb of a statement as "Red and green are the same because they're both colors."
$C: Here is the real deal.  The Senate passed but that was the easiest hurdle.  It still has to pass the House of Representatives where it will almost surely fail. And if the greatest House flip of all time  happens then President Trump will almost surely Veto it.

It is a moral victory and more of a midterms campaign point for 2018 then a real option right now.
$C: We did it reddit
$C: Doesn't matter will be dead in the water in the house. Even if by a miracle House passes it Trump will veto it. This will therefore just become a key campaign issue in the mid-terms.
$C: So we need this to pass in the house and then we need it to not be vetoed by Trump? 
$C: As a Republican for 50+ years, I'd like to say this is not a party issue. I urged both my senators to vote for net neutrality. I will do the same once this reaches the House. I have also put my party on notice they should also support the electorate rather than their campaign financiers. So, to all the other Republicans out there who believe in freedom over corporate profit, I urge them to contact not only their Representative but also their local and state party and let them know how you feel.
$C: Lol why are people voting against net neutrality?
$C: Nice, let's celebrate by exchanging beers with one another on reddit!

*braces self for ban*
$C: You said the Senate. r/prequelmemes incoming. 
$C: We did it leddit le upboat for u xDDD
$C: Man, fuck that ass clown Ajit 
$C: Nobody expected anything different - it's the House where it faces its opposition and will likely die.
$C: Why would 47 vote to discard net neutrality? The internet (and assuming majority of people)  seems to want to keep net neutrality desperately. 
$C: Here's the list of democrats [who voted for Ajit Pai](https://www.congress.gov/nomination/115th-congress/89) to be FCC chair in the first place:

Manchin (D-WV)
McCaskill (D-MO)
Peters (D-MI)
Tester (D-MT)
$C: Don't celebrate just yet. A miracle will need to happen for this to pass the House and Trump.
$C: See you all again same time and place next year probably.
$C: I love that you are political on this issue but it’s sad that you play apolitical except when it is only in your own financial best interests. 
$C: Net neutrality is just a distraction.
$C: Fucking wired news paywall. Got any links to a decent news site that isn’t backwards thinking ?
$C: Who are the 5 idiots who gave reddit gold to a reddit admin
$C: Here lies ajit pai,
Press F to shit in his grave
$C: >today’s vote demonstrated that our Senators are hearing us.

Well, 52 of them at least.
$C: The scary part of this just how many were willing to sell us out in the senate. Almost half the senate didn’t have our best interests in mind. Remember that next time you vote!
$C: can someone explain in short what they are trying to take away and what will be taken away if they win ? and who is trying to take away ?
$C: I love democracy.
$C: ITT: Reddit hates Republicans
$C: good job guiz now big co. can get promoted on search engines instead of smaller businesses fueling monopolies goddamit fucking shit
$C: Now we need to win the vote in the House, which will be much more difficult. But maybe they'll be more receptive to people contacting them since the Republicans are in danger of losing the majority. Doesn't Trump have to sign off on it even if it passes the House though? That's the biggest worry I have. Even if it passes the House we have to deal with him, and he definitely hates net neutrality.
$C: Hopefully this is as far as this foolish and immoral legislation goes. 

Keep the government away from the internet. 

Keep the internet free. 
$C: Suck it Ajit Pai you fucking corporate sellout fuck you. 
$C: “We did it Reddit!!”

Jeez. You realize that meme started because Reddit got someone killed? I wouldn’t own that phrase so casually. 
$C: The evidence is clear that net neutrality is *not* important to Republicans, considering all but 3 of them voted against it. Don’t lie and equalize that which is not equal. You only make partisanship worse that way.
$C: It's awfully presumptuous to assume all of reddit finds this to be a good thing.
$C: Well done America from your Australian brothers 
$C: We

as in the corporations that lobbied for it, pretending they aren't as underhanded as ISPs
$C: Winning the battle is not winning the war.

  


Winter is coming, Harry.
$C: Well this sucks. I guess people still want there internet to be throttled again.
$C: Man, reddit is just setting itself up for the BIGGEST meltdown since election night
$C: The house/senate is the way all regulation/laws should be passed.   It’s bullshit that unelected officials in various agencies were given the ability to pass wide ranging regulations to begin with.
$C: The battle isn't over, winning the house is a long hill to climb, but so was the senate. Getting Trump to not veto it outright if it makes it to him? That's going to require a protest and information campaign above and beyond. But we CAN do it. We just need to make sure we keep trying. Not just the US, but many places around the world are counting on our voices being heard to preserve what the internet stands for, both wholesome and... 4chan.
$C: Long ways to go before true victory. Even if it passes the House, there's a good chance Trump kills it, right?
$C: Glad to hear my Oregon senators voted right!
$C: Cool. Now this will effect nothing and we will see no difference from a month ago
$C: What does net neutrality do??
$C: I can't wait to do it again next year.
$C: My understanding is that it's doomed in house vote.... 
$C: Wait we won? I was watching the stream and everyone that was in favor of keeping net neutrality rules said they were “the minority” and that they would “despite this vote. keep fighting for a free internet” 

I’m confused 
$C: I was hoping you would lose terribly so we'd have to stop listening to this shilling
$C: Congratulations! There is still hope for you guys!
$C: Good.  How many weeks will it be before we have to do it again?
$C: I'm pretty sure you all know these aren't substantial votes. They're like when the republicans pushed full Obamacare repeals that suddenly dried up once they had a chance to pass.

This internet regulation bill will not pass, and as soon as it can, you won't hear about it again.
$C: Don’t get your hopes up this was the smallest hurdle
$C: Fuck you Ajit
$C: Ok, now we have a worse issue than the FCC ever could be. Memes themselves could be removed due to Article 13 in the EU. It threatens everything you do on the internet, and entirely removes the concept of Fair Use. THIS MUST BE STOPPED.
$C: And now I'm convinced our government is completely broken and that corporations are the new kings of England
$C: I am the senate
$C: Whoop De Do! Now Google and Facebook will be happy! Meanwhile the Reddit Herd was absolutely fucking SILENT on the ACTUAL AWFUL overreaching FOSTA. Pat yourselves on the back for being completely useless. 
$C: I still don’t really understand what it is. From what I can remember, it has to do with prices going up. The night before the decision, there were people on Twitter scared that the internet would be completely gone the next day. I told them it would still be there, and got kicked off.
$C: Just in case anyone is interested in ONCE AGAIN completely missing the picture and continuing to think the Republican Party is the party for them, here is the vote breakdown. Get ready to be TOTALLY SURPRISED.

https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/8xenqv/senators-who-voted-for-net-neutrality
$C: Chat moving so fast nobody will notice Im gay
$C: I am The Senate
$C: I AM THE SENATE
$C: Ah, reddit.  Achieves nothing yet congratulates itself.
$C: We did it ? Dont drag me down with you. Im not involved in your nonsense 
$C: 52 to 47... that is way too damn close for such an important vote. 
$C: Wow, the senate voted to reinstate their authority to regulate and control a valuable commodity. Stunning. *slow clap*
$C: wE DiD iT ReDdIt
wE DeStRoYEd EA!! We WoN ThE DoWnVoTe WAr Of 2017 GuYs!!!
$C: Yay, we won!  What did we win, where's my oj prize when I open the mail?

Kind of hard to take the end of the internet serious if it happens every other week.  

Here's a radical thought, don't tell people who build billion dollar networks what they can and can't do.  Just be happy they let your degenerate ass look at lolis in mom's basement for $50/month.
$C: Serious question: does anybody here understand how congress works, or is it kind of like Reddit’s understanding of what NN actually says? Or should I expect to be spammed by every social network about what a crime against humanity it is when this thing slams into a brick wall in the HoR?
$C: Now if we can make Youtube,Twitter and Facebook neutral--either by their policies or by a public utility bust up like Ma Bell. Their Leftward algorithm bias/shadowban policies do not serve their cause. It will actually undermine their platforms in the long run.

 Surely their politics should stand or fall on their own merits. I mean, look at what CNN did to their own ratings. Gutted, due to propagandizing while pretending to be objective. The Socmed giants need to make themselves consistent, or everybody loses! Not just deplorables, but their own bank accounts.

No more bait and switch hijinks!


$C: This is just a small step, and it can be undercut in the House quite quick.

Anyone in the US needs to check to make sure they're registered to vote, and to vote BLUE!

Republicans just don't stand for anything but the greedy at the top. Proven again by this vote.
$C: We won the battle, but not the war! Keep up the work by contacting your representatives!!
$C: This isn't going to pass the House, and if it did it surely won't be veto proof in the long run. This is kabuki and nothing more. 
$C: Might be a good opportunity to thank them, so they can get positive feedback, rather than just complaints.
$C: Are we gonna see Reddit the same way we view Facebook now in the 2020 election? 

Reddit is trying its hardest to be a social media platform despite what the majority of active users say. So why should we expect anything less of the admins and selling propaganda to the highest bidder? 
$C: If it gets to Trump I bet he tries to take credit for all this being his doing. A win either way, but still. 
$C: Thanks Obama.
$C: [deleted]
$C: this is good. the fcc ruling was always tenuous and should have been law. agencies should not be a shortcut to get around needed legislative action.
$C: [Mission Accomplished](http://currentmatters.markorton.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/112710-s-BUSH-large.jpg)
$C: You realize that literally means nothing without the house vote or Trump signing it into law
$C: Reddit is a content provider strongly advocating for regulation of the delivery system for their product.
$C: Can someone explain like I’m five?

What dies this mean now?
$C: I did it! I'd like to thank my role models and benefactors Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin, and Elon Musk for personally assisting me in bringing about this endeavor.
$C: FUCK YES!
$C: How will this help break up local monopolies or give consumers a choice in ISP?
$C: Its a moral victory and nothing else.  It will be shot down in the house almost assuredly... enjoy your participation trophies.
$C: I like freedom
$C: Hopefully us Europeans won by not having these pointless posts always at the front page of Reddit.
$C: Great, now stop fucking this site up by trying to turn it into facebook 2.0 and the internet will be set. 
$C: This is like winning the tutorial... We still have to make it through the rest of the game and the boss battle (Trump)
$C: Get fucked Ajit Paid off by Verizon 
$C: You know half your userbase thinks we just "lost" the Net Neutrality vote in the Senate, right?
$C: Woo I finally did something other than getting a 38&#37; on my french speaking exam.
$C: I might be late to know this, but what are the arguments for repelling net neutrality?
$C: This is all symbolic as not only does this have to pass a house vote (Ryan will never allow this on the floor) but it has to be signed off by Trump. 
$C: Unfortunate that this happened. There's no way it will pass the House of Representatives however. Even if it does, Trump will veto it.
$C: "We"?
$C: Lol...will never pass the house and Trump would never pass this if it somehow did pass the house. 
$C: Remember who your House Members are when the House Republicans kill this.


$C: Yeah! Now all those evil corporations will not be able to screw us which was why they paid to lobby for it. 
$C: The catch 22 is real 
$C: lol have fun
$C: We? I'm on Reddit and 100% oppose Net Neutrality. Don't include me in your propaganda. 
$C: We did it Reddit!
$C: [deleted]
$C: This is cool and all but when’re you gonna introduce a block button that allows you to not only mute people but also hide your posts/comments from someone who’s harassing you? Every other social network site has this. Also, when’re you gonna bring back the section of the mobile app that shows your post drafts?
$C: Does Reddit (and other large companies) supporting this measure have something personal (monetarily beneficial) for them to gain from doing so?
$C: I live in Australia 
$C: It is really cringeful to see all the posts you made, more like whining than activism. Yay! We did it, we are all little kids that did it all together!
$C: Very biased title. Imagine this announcement on the front page: "We won the abortion vote in the Senate!"

You don't speak for all users of this website.
$C: Good thing you care so much when something happens outside the US... 

Oh, wait...
$C: So the republicans are american tories/The whories are british republicans?
$C: Oh, also: stop using "we" unqualified. Plenty of redditors don't support net neutrality.
$C: Congrats. Huge step
$C: What the fuck how
$C: Wow the first time reddit told me something positive.

Neat.
$C: YAH
$C: hooray!!
$C: Don't get overly excited, this was the easiest hurdle it had. Even if we manage to get it through the house next it still has to be signed by Trump.
$C: As happy as i am about this, the vote will get absolutely destroyed in the house.
$C: How can we be sure enough people in the House of Representatives vote in favor of Net Neutrality?
$C: We did it reddit
$C: #I AM THE SENATE
$C: Finally jeez 😏 
$C: Um, we didn't do anything. It still needs to pass the House and it doesn't look good there. 
$C: Probably not for the house, but I hope it will though...
$C: Fuck yeah and fuck you Ajit!
$C: 52 to 47 doesn’t make me feel confident about the future outcome but here’s hoping.
$C: Yay censorship 
$C: We? Are people who don't support government control over the internet no longer welcome on Reddit, then?
$C: If President Trump doesn't sign it it won't matter so you've win nothing.
$C: This is why you never say that it’s over. It’s not over until it’s over. 
$C: "We win"  talking like the government's on your side. Get outta here with that shit. 
$C: I am the Senate
$C: (insert prequel meme here)
$C: Is this loss?
$C: Why aren't you Americans **this** engaged when other things are up, like health care and free education?
$C: A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.
$C: I love democracy.
$C: Unfortunately net neutrality is anything but.  It is a giveaway to facebook, Netflix, google et al.  I know you supporters have the best of intentions but PLEASE read and understand what you support instead of blindly supporting things like this.  If Netflix uses a lot more bandwidth than some other websites then they should pay for it!!!!  Period!

I know most of you will say TL:DR but you will end up with exactly what the proponents want.  It is unlikely that this is anything but a publicity stunt but the ignorance on this topic is mind blowing.
$C: This is exactly what the time traveler said would happen( from 2030)
$C: Thank god. The fact it got repealed in the first place is disgustingly undemocratic. A bunch of old guys who don't know what a jpeg is do not represent the country!
$C: Why are people so happy about this. Isent this aginst the constitution for the goverment to control private companys prices. 
$C: 52-47 is a really slim majority. Your government must hate you.
$C: If trump vetos the bill we can still over ride that with a 2/3rds vote from both the house and the senate, we're. I'm pretty sure we're going to win this
$C: And fuuuuuuuck Ajit Pai. 
$C: If this does pass the House then the question is, would Trump sign or veto this? I honestly have no idea what his political stance is anymore
$C: Free market=strongest survive. 
$C: You think Ajit is gonna make another patronizing video pretending that we're the minority? 
$C: Y’all are so dumb, net neutrality is good
$C: A win in this administration is something to cheer about
$C: Awesome!

Also, fuck those 47 senators. 
$C: YES! WE DID IT!  
\(insert Dora the Explorer: We Did It song here\)
$C: Innovation and growth will certainly suffer. Always does when shackling the free market. Instead of allowing the free market to work for consumers with more choice, new companies \(Can anyone say Netflix\) and more competition for more services, products, and better prices. The socialist ideology cries out equal misery for all. I hope it fails. Net Neutrality will set us back at least 20 years if enacted.
$C: **wooooohooooooo**
$C: Trump will never sign it if it passes the house....so.... lol
$C: Does every not understand they have been dipped? Has anything changed? Nope lol
$C: So did we win or lose June 11th? I Googled and came up with lost, but more about telecoms being sued than the outcome.
$C: Is there any update to if it is saved or not? Does it still have to go through more processes?
$C: it already was a big bad idea, i hope that would be definitely ignored
$C: I hope ISP's charge people 145 dollars a month to view this god awful fucking useless circle jerk hate mob site.  Fuck you reddit. fuckin idiots
$C: Winning a vote in either chamber of Congress means absolutely nothing. Both chambers need to be won, we need to make sure the language of the bill actually supports significant defense of Net Neutrality, and somehow be able to get the President to not veto the bill...which he will. There is no way Net Neutrality passes till representation on the federal level changes to the point there are enough members of Congress that support it that they could overturn a veto. This article is pathetic self-congratulatory bullshit that only exists to give "warm and fuzzies" to the kind of "armchair activists" that support this cause. Get off your asses and vote, and maybe this wouldn't be a fucking issue.
$C: We won the net neutrality but continue to censor 
$C: Until we get a new president it's going to get vetoed.
$C: Why vote in NN when we could work on the FTC's ability to stop problems that everyone claims will exist without NN? Why knock out market competition when you could have the FTC smash monopolies and continue to do what they've already been doing to stop throttling? It doesn't particularly make sense to me why you would want to make the internet into a public utility; creating a government monopoly that cannot be fought against by the FTC, is fully ruled and censored by the FCC, and cannot be fought against in the way that a corporatist or private sector monopoly can by the FTC. I just don't get it. I see no value in it when we have the FTC that can help us stay away from a federalized monopoly. 
$C: Are you aware of the extreme irony in Reddit fighting for the government to force ostensibly neutral content providers to not censor content while you censor more and more content with less and less reasoning as to why?

Why should comcast be forced to serve literal nazis with utter neutrality but you not?  Is reddit not meant to be public?  neutral?

TBH I am quite conflicted on the net neutrality debate, we'd do better to get government subsidy of these monopolies out of the picture entirely.
$C: Unpopular Opinion: Net Neutrality isn't good.
$C: My main question is: why are there 47 senators voting against net neutrality?

Edit: I understand there will always be those who vote against it, but I thought the number would be lower.
$C: Don't let up yet, we still need to win The House! 
$C: Yah im sure we can fully trust the corrupt  goverment help  create isp monopolies, and "regulate" the internet to be free lol.

Just like the iraq war was completely necessary. Just like how the tsa is needed to stop "hijackers and terrorist" (hint they won't the tsa is useless).

But hey government knows best right!!
$C: Trump will never ratify the repeal.
$C: Why is everyone making this out to be a big deal?  It's completely meaningless as there's nearly 0 chance of this going anywhere in the house.
$C: I'm not American but YOU GUYS NEED TO PUT THIS THROUGH THE HOUSE TOO
$C: I don’t want NN. I don’t want government control of the internet.
$C: A neutral view on Net Neutrality:  https://betanews.com/2017/12/14/the-case-against-net-neutrality-an-it-pros-perspective/ 

There was an Internet before Net Neutrality....
$C: Again.

The key term here is:

"Again."

47 Republicans voted against the measure.

This is a pattern.

This fight is not over. It wasn't over the last time we "won." It isn't over now. You know why.

This fight will not be over until they are out of power.
$C: Oh, im not brave enough for politics
$C: It’s really nice when the people you vote for actually do their jobs. This is great news! 
$C: Since the House won't pass it, and even if they did Trump won't sign it, this is nothing more than a symbolic victory. 
$C: I'm gay
$C: Well we require all Democrats and what is it, 22 Republicans to win house vote by number of favor votes and then the president, which we know he’s not for net neutrality. So it’s going to be one hell of a mission. 
$C: Lol like Reddit had anything to do with it 
$C: Nifty, you are now allowed to practice  your own fascism, high five!
$C: You people are fucking idiots if you think ISP's aren't already doing what you say they will if NN is thrown in the trash.  There is a reason why Google wants NN
$C: And the government take-over of the internet continues. This is a dark da
$C: I wonder how many people hate net neutrality for no other reason than Reddit admins supporting it. 
$C: You didn't win shit.

They tried once, they'll try twice, and enough money will change it. You're making a big deal out of it, when Comcast and Verizon already own a lions share of the market and are already dictating market.
$C: I don't really get why everyone is so invested in this particular issue. Net Neutrality was repealed, nothing changed, why is net neutrality the end of the world again?
$C: Isn't it a fucking joke we even have to deal with this?

#AmericaIsDoomed
$C: 47 senators are about to lose their jobs
$C: We cannot let this go to our heads. This is going to be a very challenging vote in the house. There is a large chance it will never leave the house and even if it does that Trump will veto it. 

People cannot become complacent about this. 
$C: "Net Neutrality" is a propaganda term. The Internet will be less free and more easily censored with it than without it. Don't believe in fancy pr a government body comes up to sell taking either money or freedom from you. . 
$C: SUCK IT, AJIT!
$C: It is shocking to me how many people understand freedom so little that they would not only take the chance of the government, but do so smiling and cheering, and and shackle themselves. 
$C: This does put a smile on my face.
$C: The house isn't going to pass this and if they did, Trump probably wouldn't sign it. So has anything really been accomplished here?
$C: Fuck off with your corporate interest bullshit.
$C: No More Political Parties! Sooner or later hopefully we will vote people in who can do the job and do it for our interests...not because of party lines...

...when it gets to the "President" it will probably be vetoed...
$C: Ajit Pie can shove that up his ass!
$C: Fuck Ajit Pai
$C: Shameful display in the senate... legislative backed monopolies are never good for America 
$C: Yay!  We lost.  More government regulation where and when it's not needed.  You lose Reddit.  You lose.
$C: Next plan of business. How do we get this Ajit clown out of any position that can threaten net neutrality again?
$C: I've said this many times before, but I'll say it again. As a Republican, I'm against Title 2 because it treats every single ISP, no matter how big or small, as if they're a monopoly. I would be more than happy with a bill that simply says "don't discriminate traffic," but I don't agree with reinstating the previous regulation.
$C: I was listening to the radio when I heard it. But then they said it's not likely to change much as essentially all republicans are against it and will not bring it up in their place for a vote. I'm sitting there thinking "WTF? How can they say that / that sounds mildly illegal" As a person in Arkansas, a very red state, that blows. Internet here in rural places sucks enough without censor based slow downs (which around these parts is a lot of stuff)
$C: I hope Ajit Pai is having a shitty day
$C: Get this shit off the front page
$C: Too bad the cheeto-in-chief will veto it like the piece of shit he is.
$C: Seems like everything has been so bleak. I needed some good news.
$C: Even if this doesn't pass, we now have Congresspeople (and with hope, a POTUS) on record saying no.
$C: Go register to vote, and get Democrats in the House.
$C: Call me a stooge, but I am not sure how restoring NN is really beneficial. I am sorta playing devils advocate based on what I can comprehend due to its complexity. The *real* problem lies with oligopolies, and frankly, NN is the wrong fight. 

First, a lot of you made wild claims that the repeal *could* restrict speeds based on which content and streaming services, or worse, have the customer pay extra if they desired to stream. That in itself is actually pretty reasonable in my honest opinion. If you understand how the internet works, you're basically putting a gun to the head of an ISPs and forcing them into transferring your data at the same rate as an email or using reddit. I think if you rely heavily on streaming data, you should consider that it does require a lot of data to be transferred. If you want that service, you should be paying for the prioritization or deal with the fact other services are prioritized based on deals said services may or may not make with ISPs. 

Second, directly after NN's repeal, my speeds doubled and I pay the same price as I did before. Fortunately for me (I guess), there is more than one ISP in my area I can choose from. So why exactly would I want all of the ISPs playing by the same rules for transferring data across the internet? It is also believed that the Google Fiber project straight up died after the NN implementation and no further expansion(s) were made (from what I gather anyway). 

Third, if censorship is your concern because NN is no longer governing which content can be viewed or not, use a different DNS and a VPN. All data at that point all of your data would just be encrypted anyway and the ISP won't be able to view it other than were you come in and out of. I mean, isn't that how people are getting anyway with torrents? If censorship was really the issue here, torrent sites would already be down. Don't get me wrong, PB came down, but that has that really stopped anyone from continuing piracy and sharing pirated music, movies, etc.? Did NN bring PB back? Just a thought. 

Again, I understand very little about the issue because of how complex it is and 400-some pages is a lot of reading to study to get a full grasp of things, but if the repeal of NN could effectively bring *more* ISPs around it could also bring about potential for better customer service and less shady business from the likes of AT&T and Comcast. I would prefer not to fuck with them if I have an alternative, but from the looks and sounds of NN, the alternatives are actually more limited than you think under the guise of "neutrality" that all content on the internet will be treated "fairly". Furthermore, if anyone is restricted to satellite internet, or have ever had to use satellite internet, makes the repeal worth it. Sat speeds fucking blow, but at least you can use a service that may not blow as badly as the other guys. 

So far, as a consumer and spectator, the repeal hasn't made much of an impact, other than speed, for me to want to have NN back. Just my $.02
$C: You didn't win shit. It has to pass in the republican-controlled house, and get signed by Trump before you can claim victory.
$C: Sometimes I hate this place.  Young Americans hate freedom, and that bums me out.
$C: Great work everyone, all the calls, and emails helped, the internet is more important tool and we all proved that it has power to get us heard, to the house we go!
$C: I'm excited! Maybe this country's government hasn't been completely bought and paid for by telecommunications companies!
$C: First world problems, but seriously how has the internet changed since 2015 when these rules went into affect?
$C: Can’t wait to neutralize the conservative American voice with “Neutrality “!  Great tool 
$C: HAHAHAHA FUCK YOU AJIT PAI
$C: GET FUCKED AJIT PAI
$C: Dammit! 

I was certain I would be able to cope with whatever problems it would have created. 

But I was looking forward to watching you all rage. 
$C: Net neutrality: an internet phenomenon sweeping the nation’s millenials that basically boils down to “I trust AT&T less than I trust Facebook and Google.”


$C: Why the hell are they praying before commencing the senate session. I find that incredibly offensive.
$C: YAY!

all is not won yet though, but this is a great start!
$C: Can someone explain why all Democrats are for the reversal and why most Republicans are against it? Should this foreshadow for the outcome of how Congress will vote based on which party has the majority? And then there's trump, who will probably veto this because Democrats voted for it.
$C: Don't forget, this doesn't negate them from being 99.99% pieces of crap on everything else.
$C: political theater boys & girls,     
and fund raising for nn pacs to do other stuff kiddies want,   
like legalizing pot, privacy, or backing diy gadget repairs.

congress has to vote within 60 days and the republican   
majority will kill it, not to mention trump would not sign it. 
 
this is all about politicians who hope to get millennial votes by saying   
they are voting to keep nn in place, knowing full well it will not pass.

nn's best chance now is states doing their own version of nn,   
and making sure the feds can't do shit about each states nn.
$C: Just wanna point out that reddit admins did nothing while russian bots invaded reddit and helped the man who repealed net neutrality get elected. Downvote if you want but its the truth
 
$C: This is exactly why we love Reddit!
$C: [deleted]
$C: Im glad Collins kept her word. She's been a good politician for Maine for a while, but lately has been pandering too hard to her party. Glad she crossed the aisle for this. I emailed her more than once on the topic and the reply always said she supported NN. So glad she wasn't lying to my face.
$C: Hell yea!!! Long live Net Neutrality!
$C: And this is good news? Morons
$C: Not american, but happy for you guys.
$C: Still a concerningly high number who voted to repeal
$C: That's good.
$C: YAAAAAY!!!!
$C: Why exactly is everyone advocating that the government be in charge of the internet?
$C: Can someone explain this to me in 3rd grade terms? Because I swear I have no idea what all of this is about lol!
$C: Good Lord.  Look at all the paste-eating morons who think "Net Neutrality" is a good idea.

The internet is a utility and should be regulated as such.  Net Neutrality does not do this.  Net Neutrality forces companies to *NOT* compete with data rates or content.  It essentially forces your fat neighbor who downloads 2TB a day of zoophilia to be treated the same as your grandma who checks her email once a week.

So many retards here have such a bad experience with their ISPs that they want to stick it to them anyway possible, without knowing or caring that they are only screwing themselves.  ISPs *CAN NOT* block content and still have protections as "common carriers".  This is what is actually getting Google, Reddit, Comcast, Charter, and ATT in trouble right now.  So saying that without Net Neutrality that this will happen is a *LIE*, and people pushing Net Neutrality know it.  Freaking idiots.
$C: Yea, I don't think the govt should "regulate" the internet. It should stay "free" and neutral. 
$C: /r/HailCorporate

Continue the circle jerk reddit and pretend you had something to do with the vote. 
$C: *For like the next six weeks, probably.
$C: Keep bothering the HoR's.

It will probably get vetoed and then we will have to bother the Senate again but we can win.
$C: This is great news. However, there is a long ways to go for this bill and for this issue. Thanks to Reddit for fighting for its awareness and double thanks to any of you who called your members of congress.
$C: [deleted]
$C: ...but it still needs to pass another house and POTUS. Good luck. These fuckers hate American life.
$C: Just called every congress\(wo\)man in my state and left voicemails. Get the ball rolling with them early! This will be a harder vote to win. Look yours up [here](https://www.house.gov/representatives) and get to it!

I know there are already several scripts out there, but mine's below in case you feel so inclined to borrow from it.

Good luck, we're all counting on [YOU](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Uncle_Sam_%28pointing_finger%29.jpg/571px-Uncle_Sam_%28pointing_finger%29.jpg)!

Good Evening Congress\(wo\)man \[Name\],

My name is \[Name\], and I live in \[City\], \[State\]. I'm contacting you this evening regarding the recent Net Neutrality developments. I am absolutely appalled with the FCC's move to repeal net neutrality in December, but heartened by the senate's actions today to uphold and preserve a free and open internet for our nation's citizens \(and your constituents\).

My family, friends, and I will be voting in November, and I can assure we are all paying very close attention to this matter. The actions you take as a congressional representative of the \[xTH\] district will have a profound impact on how we vote this fall. 

As an IT professional, a daily internet user, and a concerned citizen of the great state of \[State\], I hope that we can count on you to do right thing and vote in favor of supporting net neutrality when the opportunity comes before the house of representatives.

Should you have any questions for me, or wish to discuss your stance on this matter, I am happy to be available, and can be reached by phone at \[Number\], or e\-mail at \[email\].

Thank you so much for your time and consideration of this very important matter, which will no doubt have a profound impact on the future of our country.
$C: Net Neutrality is nothing more than government getting control of the internet for absolutely no good reason, just fear mongering threats of higher Netflix fees. You have been played into handing power back to government which was never needed. Congratulations, but don't pop your champaign yet!
$C: "We" didn't win anything. I disagree with how this website itself blatantly ignores hundreds of thousands of its users and takes for granted that we all agree on the same political laws and bills.

This blanket partisanship only hurts the website as a whole.
$C: Yaaaaay!
$C: Now we just need to get it through the house and president
$C: Every single senator that voted against is a republican. Really goes to show which side sticks up for our freedoms. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: [deleted]
$C: Too close damnit
$C: WE
$C: n i c e
$C: Thank God 
$C: Oh how the turn tables.
$C: This isn't the end! It feels extreme, but more action is needed.
$C: Now to the House!
$C: Opening the page I fully expected a "haha, fooled you! We now control your medias."
$C: Thank you. 
$C: lets go ashit pai
$C: This is great! Anyone have an estimate on how long this will take to get to the House now?

Obviously we should start contacting them now, but having a timeline would be really helpful!
$C: nice

$C: I am actually surprised that I am surprised
$C: Fun isn’t something one considers when balancing American politics, but this does bring a smile to my face
$C: YES!
$C: May not make it thru the house.... and seems really unlikely to make it past trump
$C: Yes!!! Reddit party in every city! 

Let’s go streaking! I’m going streaking!!
$C: Woot!
$C: INCONCEIVABLE!
$C: This is incredible! I'm blown away and it brings a lot of hope!
$C: YAAAAAAAAYYYY
$C: I've got $20 on President Trump vetoing if it makes it past the house. 
$C: That’s great, welcome home internet.
$C: Yippeee
$C: It’s just like infinity war
$C: By Manchester rules, Ajit Pai now must disembowel himself with a sword in shame.
$C: Awesome! However, won’t they try this same bull again next year/year’s down the block?
$C: BEEP Ajit Pie 
$C: Wooooo
$C: WE ARE THE SENATE!
$C: Nice.
$C: Who voted in favor of what? 
$C: Good job reddit!
$C: give gold
$C: Yayy..!!

$C: 52-47 wow that was scary close. 
$C: Oh GOD!


YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH








woo
$C: Well played Reddit
$C: As a canadian I'm super happy for you guys 
$C: Can I get a **FUCK AJIT!**
$C: Woah we did it Reddit!
$C: The people have spoken
$C: Anyone got the roll call so we can figure out if we need to vote out our representatives 
$C: Fuck yeah, Internet, we did the things as a community to stop the bad thing!

Till next time, it's been an honour.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Amazing. Fuck the FCC.
$C: Holy shit. Good job guys
$C: Yippee! Fairness!
$C: Pai is so pissed in that photo. Fucker.
$C: **WE CAN WIN**
$C: To see the look on Pai's face right now 
$C: Inb4 Final boss Trump comes in with the veto hammer.
$C: YES!!! now we may continue the debate that is Laurel and Yanny!
$C: Haha we did it, reddit... 
$C: Maybe Palpatine isn't so bad after all... 
$C: 3 months later, we lose net neutrality again.
$C: > We won...!

This time.
$C: 
Hey /u/arabscarab,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
$C: I am the senate.
$C: Counting down the days until it dies again
$C: So what can we do now to help? 
$C: Yeahhhhhhhhhh!
$C: It light of today’s events, I’d say we avoided a real Ajit-storm. 
$C: How does this impact the people who don’t live the the USA?
$C: Lets keep fighting the good fight. All of us, together. There are no sides when it comes to information, just the truth. 
$C: [You're welcome.](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/25gszl/only_you_can_protect_net_neutrality/chh06m5/?context=3)
$C: Good shit boys
$C: Reddit didn't do it, the internet did it as a whole
$C: Amazing, what lovely news！
$C: the house will never vote for it.   too many scumbags/paid off people.
$C: Fuck Ajit Pie! Piece of shit
$C: we did it reddit, put me in the screencap
$C: Anyone else think Ajit Pai is like Jeremy from Parks and Rec?
$C: Well that's good.
$C: What does this mean for FCC ending NN on June 11th? Does the FCC ruling get frozen until the House votes on it?
$C: Hehe it’s great also knowing how much they paid people off to support it
$C: Call me a tree cause I just nut
$C: We have brought peace, freedom, justice and security to our new internet empire
$C: Big news!
$C: I'm so glad u/ajitpai wasn't OP
$C: Cool.

Now we just need to end big pharma marijuana prohibition.
$C: Suck on that, Patel
$C: YEAHHHHH HAHAHAHHHA!! WOOOOHOOO I MSO HAPPY AHHHHHH !!! 
$C: Yes! Let's get our hopes up! That have never ended badly!
$C: We did it Reddit!
$C: Nice
$C: This is great news, still it’s crazy that the vote was so close, shows how much we need to act
$C: Oh thank fuck
$C: Why are people acting like this is *the* win? NN is still going away.
$C: Yes!!! THANK YOU democracy. This is why we fight for this county. 
$C: In glad to see there is a little good left in the government that has not succumb to cooperate money. 
$C: Yay! Democracy at its finest! 
$C: You may have won, but many of us lost.
$C: Ya yeet
$C: Good does this mean I’ll stop getting adverts for it everywhere 
$C: FCC: Mission failed! We'll get 'em next time!
$C: y aint they gibin us more money for dem programs? us folk aint need no interwebs
$C: Yay
$C: ... we did it... we did it reddit
$C: We did it boys, now on to yesn’t
$C: "We did it reddit" is starting to sound more like Bush's "mission accomplished" speech.
$C: We did it reddit!
$C: Something good happened this year in the Senate!
$C: Woooooooooo
$C: We won Net Neutrality in the senate, now when can we win independence from all this promoted content?

$C: So now the House. Too bad if won’t pass there but if by some miracle it does Trump will veto the bill so...R.I.P.
$C: "We won"...you didn't do shit!
$C: Yay!
$C: hell yea boys
$C: It’s worrying how close the actual vote is :-/
$C: IT'S BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!
$C: When is the house vote?

$C: Great, now how about unbanning all of those subs you banned?
$C: [deleted]
$C: Ajit Pai on suicide watch 
$C: Eat dick Ajit Pai 
$C: Thank ourselves!
$C: fuck that cunt pai
$C: no way the house would sign it in in its current state. They'll either butcher it to make it useless or change things to make it actually worse for NN. Then when democrats vote against it they'll be like "Ah Ha... You don't actually want NN!"
$C: /r/WTF
$C: Nice 
$C: 47 Senators voted against it? Why?
$C: Fuck off, it's gonna get killed in the house or vetoed
$C: Yeah! Fuck you Ajit Pai!
$C: This is amazing! 
$C: At least there is more hope for now.

Edit: I wonder who those 47 assholes were.
$C: I feel like this isn’t over, like Dr. Claw is out there saying “Next time Gadget, next time..”
$C: Ohh, ok. Gotcha. Now that you mention that, I seem to remember hearing it in those terms before. 
$C: Where can we see what each individual senator voted? I need to know who’s gotta gtfo next election.
$C: aaaaaaaaand I’m hard again
$C: Steve Huffman is a white supremacist.
$C: 🔥 
$C:  .
$C: How long will that last before next voting starts?  They only have to win it once and personally I am sick as fuck hearing about the vote so on the next round; they won.

$C: There is no way this will become law if the telecom giants don't want it to. Our politicians are too easily bought.
$C: Doesn't Trump have to sign this eventually for it to go through?
$C: I'm pessimistic about Trump signing it, and even more pessimistic that it'll even get a vote in the House.

$C: Wait, I thought this was going away June 11th?
$C: Colin’s, Kennedy and Murkowski have my respect. do what’s right for the growth of the nation; fuck partisan bullshit 
$C: Since everything is going great, next up is giving up the new reddit.
$C: Kind of out of the loop with net neutrality. So is everything good now, it ended up being permanently saved?
$C: *by some miracle, it passes the house and trump doesn't veto it*

*trump takes credit*

*cue the biggest reddit meltdown of the year*
$C: Yes!
$C: Can anybody ELi5 why Net Neutrality is important? 
$C: Hopefully by the time that vote nears a nice subpoena will be dropped into Shit Pai's lap.
$C: Wont this most likely be vetoed even if passes the house?
$C: r/prematurecelebration
$C: Let's be honest, there is a very, very, very slim chance that the president is going to approve this.
$C: Wow, we actually did it reddit!
$C: I am the senate
$C: I just want to go on the record saying that this net neutrality policy is a bad idea.
$C: Never underestimate the power of the internet


$C: to bad it wil be shot down like a raise for schol teachers
$C: Of course Cruz and Rubio voted against. Spineless ingrates that they are. 
$C: FUCK YOU AJIT PAI!!!
$C: Great job everyone. Now lets overturn the Reddit redesign
$C: I needed a reason to buy a cake...this will do. Congrats everyone! Woo!
$C: FUCK YES REDDIT
$C: [Tonight, we celebrate!](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/PhysicalSizzlingAzurewingedmagpie-size_restricted.gif)

$C: Congrats losers
$C: More regulation somehow equals more freedom...
$C: I love democracy. 
$C: This isn't going to do anything. Plebbit BTFO
$C: Can someone explain to me what is net neutrality and why is it important? I've heard arguments for and against, but it's really hard to come by actual information and facts. Thanks.
$C: Real question. What rules are being discussed here?
$C: Well color me shocked.
$C: WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS
$C: DUCT TAPE
$C: This is great 
$C: Does anyone know when the next time this is voted on? It seemed awfully close this time around.
$C: One step closer!
$C: let’s see if the house will pass it and then if trump will veto it .
$C: This will be dead-on-arrival at the White House. Thanks for playing. LOL
$C: Funny that the admins seemed pretty quiet about it over the past few weeks.
$C: FUCK YEAH! GO REDDIT!
$C: Trump will never sign it, it will get vetoed
$C: Thank you to those republicans who voted for net neutrality!
$C: Holy shit I thought this was a lost cause but I still was hoping we would win!
$C: Well now it’s time to call the representatives who are in the house, and of course vote out those 47 assholes who voted no 
$C: That cements my vote for Beto
$C: Woot woot 
$C: fuck ajit 
$C: we did it reddit
$C: YAY 
$C: How do we know we made a difference?
$C: HELL YES
$C: Hate to be a downer but, is there really any chance that trump doesn't veto this?
$C: The house and asshole will not pass it.
$C: i'd say almost 50-50 is not an indication that congress is listening. 
$C: YES!!!!!
$C: Im stunned.
$C: Most of the supporters of the bill are democrats and not republicans. How will it pass in the House of Representatives where the republicans have a majority. ( I’m not from the USA. So I don’t know how the system works.)
$C: While I highly doubt it makes it past the House vote. This is great news for all internet users.
$C: Do we get a gladiator style punishment of all the head fcc people fighting lions in a pit?
$C: This is sort of irrelevant but why don’t the votes add up to 100?
$C: What if I'm not American?
$C: It’s not important to just Americans, you know...
$C: He won’t sign it.
$C: We won a fight but the war is far from over...
$C: Quick grab your free karma!!!
$C: Okay, so let's say it passes the house as well.... What are the odds of the POTUS signing it?
$C: I'm happy with this vote, but I really don't like how you say, "we did it, reddit."  
$C: Le reddit army did it again! upboated xD
$C: I heard [this](https://youtu.be/LRTarynctKo) in my head as I read that
$C: Incoming, top post of the year.
$C: Who’s we? Reddit is a Public forum 
$C: What happens if the HOR votes against it?  Back to square one?
$C: Good job team, get ready for the next round
$C: DAB DAB DAB DAB
$C: The Senate is just punting. Repubs know the house won't pass it so they play it safe. This won't be passed.
$C: Cool but it ain’t over yet. 
$C: What do you mean "we" did it?
$C: We did it reddit
$C: Join QuietAsKept in clash royale
$C: Now we fight in the House.
$C: Nice try fella, I AM the senate!
$C: Didn’t even realize it was gone. 
$C: Awesome, now can we win the war of not having the abortion that is new reddit forced on us? 
$C: omg! good job spez and team! 
$C: That's good. 
$C: The House won't vote on it, this was a play by Senate Democrats to gain favor for the midterms this year. 
$C: This is amazing

$C: Means nothing. All this was is a midterm slogan. We voted republicans rejected it. They know it doesn't stand a chance in the house. It's all for negative pr for Republicans 
$C: I can almost taste Ajit's tears!
$C: I AM the Senate
$C: Will fail in house. I promise you that. Won’t get a vote. 
$C: Ironic, considering reddit isn’t neutral at all.
$C: You all know this won't pass the House, right?
$C: Cool now you can shut the fuck up about it
$C: If this somehow gets passed the house, what would trump do? Has he even commented on net neutrality?
$C: Oh shit boys
$C: good job guys lesgo
$C: wait what
$C: I am truly proud of everybody who stepped up, defended our rights, and let their voice be heard. Y'all did good.
$C: It won't get through the house, nor will it not get veto'd by trump. You love in 1980, and will continue to until you start physically getting up and practicing your duty of civil disobedience.
$C: This isn't just a placation move right? Like this will return net neutrality to its original state?
$C: Please call ur local representatives, it’s very unlikely that it’ll get passed the house
$C: Who is we?
$C: This is good news Net Neutrality for all
$C: Nice work Trump! MAGA!
$C: Can we get a list of the scumbags that voted against it? They need to be replaced 
$C: WOOO
$C: Wow. 
$C: Oh greaaat...
$C: Updoots for everyone!
$C: Hey FCC, 

KISS


MY


PISS
$C: What lobbying efforts did reddit take in support of this? 
$C: Excuse my language but... FUCK AJIT PAI
$C: Hells yeah!
$C: Good job everyone! See you all again soon when they try to pull these shenanigans again!
$C: We got Net Neutrality down, now, we just need CSS.
$C: Yeeett
$C: So does this mean that Craigslist will allow the casual encounters section back?
$C: Omg thank fuck for that
$C: Free gold to everyone who votes in a call to action?
$C: So we won or it's not over just yet?
$C: Looks like I'll be voting out 2 republicans in my state.
$C: Nice

$C: Congratulations Americans fighting for freedom on the web ! One bit closer at least 
$C: I was really skeptical that we would have any effect on the vote whatsoever. Even if the battle's not over, it's damned reassuring knowing our voices are being heard. 
$C: See you in a couple months. 
$C: So we haven’t won shit then. The House is the hardest place to pass bill
$C: Not in *my* Senate. 

Since I am Spanish.
$C: update it doesnt mean shit if the house doesn't win too and or the pres signs it.
$C: We are the Senate.
$C: Holy shit, I'm honestly surprised... This is a huge win for man kind!

$C: How did Comcast become so evil even with NN in place?
$C: The senators had nothing to lose by supporting this because they have the House firewall. The House might even pass it knowing Trump will veto it. It will not get enough support to override veto. 
$C: I didn’t even know we were playing!
$C: Won nothing. They pushed a vote they know will not pass the next level. Mid term elections strategy to make this a political point with no real difference.  #politics#theybothdothesameshit
$C: I am the Senate 
$C: I am the senate
$C: I feel like I've seen this before.
$C: Hurray! I knew if I sat around and did nothing that other more interested people would get the job done. 
$C: WE EAT THOSE
$C: From my limited understanding, the bill has no chance in the house, what's Reddit's take on this?
$C: Win the battle, lose the war.
$C: Glad I could help from my couch with these upvotes. 
$C: No we didn't. Slim chance the house passes this and if they do trump will veto. 
$C: Welp, see you guys in the next few years for this crap again 
$C: This is symbolic. As the bill will stall in the republican house. 
$C: I'm a Trump supporter and this issue matters to us also! feels good to have some unity across all of Reddit for the first time in awhile, let's keep fighting my dudes! 
$C: Sure it got through.  What are they pork barreling to it, though. 
$C: Thank god I was running out of pornograpjy
$C: Finally.
$C: yes boi!!!!!
$C: I love democracy
$C: This serves as an example to illustrate the power people have when they join efforts.  
I am really happy 😊
$C: Haha yes.

Stuff you, Ajit.
$C: Good news for a change! 
:P

$C: "We won..." so the kept NN banned?
$C: Tomorrow news: Russian hackers hacked the Senate to revert Net Neutrality/s
$C: Does Reddit make enough money to lobby for Net Neutrality? Can they out-corrupt Internet Providers?
$C: Gentlemen. We got em.
$C: WE DID IT REDDIT
$C: yay
$C: Fuck you ajit pai, fuck you you fucking cunt
$C: Fuck yeah I didn’t do shit
$C: It's nice to see we got one over corporate America, at least for now...
$C: The house is a republican controlled house an Trump has already said he’ll veto it so did we really win?
$C: Thank you (insert believes)!!!!  FINALLY
$C: Great! Now ban racism on Reddit!
$C: What does this mean for me?
$C: Hell Yeah
$C: We won! But the battle is never over. 
$C: Up yours, Ajit Pai!
$C: Ajit Pais like **Oh fuck**
$C: So no competition for new ISP; stuck with the shitty ones that we are forced to regulate
$C: @
$C: Please list the 47 against and please let no-one of their like ever get into office again! 
$C: No! What the fuck Ajit?
$C: I want to be happy about this, but it still needs to pass the house.  Are there enough democrats to give the overwhelming majority of citizens what they want? Or is this just doomed to fail with Republican majority too big to overcome?
$C: And most importantly the gas can now costs $16.99
$C: Something something 1984 something something you all love Big Brother.
$C: Great and I didnt even have to do shit
$C: [removed]
$C: HEY,  MEGA INTERNET CORPORATE SHILLS WIN!
$C: It's sad that this would pass by such a slim margin while public opinion for this issue is so in favor of net neutrality. 
$C: Good!
$C: The internet is (a step toward being) saved!
$C: WOW! GOD IS _REAL_!!!!
$C: This is great news! 
$C: This wouldn't matter so much, if I didn't just have one internet provider. My choose is Comcast or Comcast
$C: There is a god, this confirmed it for me
$C: Nothing to see here.  Won't pass the House.
$C: Anyone else finds it ridiculous how close we were to losing in the votes? 
$C: YES! *Daniel Bryan*
$C: Won't matter with the corrupt piece of dog shit sitting in office.
$C: It's not over we only won the battle not the war
$C: How fucked are we when it goes to the White House and Trump veto’s it because Ajit Pai’s one of his buddies 
$C: Can’t wait for Trump to veto this. 😑
$C: I give this gold!!!!! 
$C: Our democracy is an illusion 
$C: Effin' awesome! 
$C: Ya!!!  see you guys in 3 months 
$C: https://twitter.com/netflix/status/509052057429372929?s=21

Just saw this again today. Can't believe that this fight has been going on for YEARS. Hopefully this will be the start of the end of the battle for net neutrality. 
$C: Reddit really only care about saving face and not the actual users of the site
$C: Wait... It has to go through the white house? What does that mean?
$C: Why is Ajit Pai the cover image lmfao
$C: Amazing news :))))
$C: I didn't notice any change when it was gone. So what did it fix that I didn't notice.
$C: Yaaaay!!!!
$C: Trump did it!! He started the net force and Bam! Next is space!! Woooot.
$C: We did it guys!
$C: What is the reasoning of the people voting against?
$C: I find it scary that 47 voted against it compared to the 52 who voted for. If just 3 people had switched sites net neutrality would have lost
$C: YES!!!!
$C: Yeet
$C: Does it still have Obama’s exemptions for the cable companies?
$C: Cause this will be at the top of reddit I want to leave my mark, hi mom!
$C: I love democracy i love the republic
$C: Let me guess. Right down party lines?
$C: Hey guys. How are you all doing?
$C: Next lets legalize weed!!
$C: Can't feel too happy, since Haspel was confirmed around the same time. Win some, lose some. 
$C: SUCK IT AJIT PAI 
$C: it's gonna die
$C: Great news. Now let's make those 47 senators famous so they don't get re elected
$C: There is literally zero chance that this will then pass and then get Trump's signature. The government is more unified in putting unaccountable torturers in high offices than in securing the public's interest. 
$C: Thank you for the update. This is amazing news.
$C: Really?!

Was it us?

Awesome!
$C: If only you millennials could use your activism for something useful.
$C: Wowie! Congratulations Americans!
$C: I'm just going to put [this](https://fee.org/articles/time-to-end-net-neutrality-regulation-once-and-for-all/) here.
$C: YEAH!!

EAT A DICK AJIT PAI, YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT!!
$C: ok w
$C: Great. Let’s hand control of the internet over to the Government while Drumph is in power!
$C: Great I ignored the problem and it went away
$C: Aljit's mom is quadra gay
$C: Too bad fox and friends is going to tell the president that net neutrality is bad and vetoing any bill will piss off the libs.  
$C: Was this just a vote only Net neutrality or was there some sneaky sneaky bill tagged onto it?
$C: Congrats America! Finally some good news! 
$C: Good. Can this website please stop whining about it now?
$C: It's going to be tough to pass it down to the House but I believe!
$C: Well there goes progress.
$C: Its like this was the plan the whole time... reddit literally did nothing.
$C: > While this measure must now go through the House of Representatives and then the White House

So you're telling me we won the easy mode vote, and next are the hard mode and hell mode votes?

Any chance the HoR vote will happen in 2019?
$C: GG EZ
$C: Democrats: 49-0 in favor.

Republicans: 47-3 against.

But both parties are the same!
$C: Commenting to save for later. 
$C: https://democracy.io/
$C: This is great news for those who want reddit to be a social network!
$C: Now vote out all people that voted against it in the next election. Might fix a lot of our issues. Not all, but some.
$C: omg I was so sure I was in the multiverse where we lost thank god
$C: Yea but would it pass the house? Republicans have bigger majority there
$C: Cool.
$C: The easiest way to do this, but also the hardest, would be for everyone to drop their isp if it went through. 
$C: i love democracy!
$C: Lot of upvotes
$C: List the names of the Senators who went against the people's will and voted against restoring net neutrality.
$C: Doesn’t this mean the gov now controls the internet? Isn’t that a bad thing?
$C: Is there a way to see which side states voted?
$C: #WE DID IT  REDDIT 
$C: House and Trump will kill it and if with some magic it passes, Trump might veto it:(
$C: This is a campaign ploy.  Don’t count on a return of net neutrality 
$C: BUT the house of scumbags will kill it!  sorry... need to oust them!
$C: Very scary how many sensors want to restrict the flow of information
$C: I know I'm late, but I just wanna say, "Fuck, yeah."
$C: Abolishing net neutrality was just yet another flop by the failed Trump administration. Sad. 
$C: That's a good news even for other countries. 
$C: Nice.
$C: I love democracy 
$C: Why did McCain not vote?
$C: Lol no one cares about the votes of fake Republicans like Murkowski and Collins. This will fail in the House
$C: [Read this](https://i.imgur.com/aOJeC1l_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium)
$C: HOLY SHIT!?
$C: Nice
$C: VICTORY!
$C: Holy shit this is awesome
$C: Up yours Ajit Pai 😈
$C: I love democracy 
$C: We did it reddit!  As a four year member of reddit, I take full responsibility.  I will accept all gifts as a thank you.
$C: FUCK YES! One of those was my Republican Senator (Murkowski) that voted! I totally harassed her with multiple e-mails on this, too! Interestingly enough, I never got a response on the net neutrality ones I sent, but I did on another issue. Maybe they just didn't have a staffer for net neutrality. So glad that the lack of a response didn't mean she was ignoring the issue like I thought might be happening.
$C: Thank you reddit, everyone, keep it up!
$C: YEA BOYIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
$C: VICTORY!!!!
$C: I am the senate 
$C: It's not going to pass
$C: Yay now everything will stay the exact same as before NN. And after it too! Yeah go reddit.
$C: Congratulations to all Americans. Fuck that smug lizard-toad Pai.
$C: How about you start keeping to the Standard of "Net Neutrality" here on Reddit first and stop Banning and Moderating away content and Subs you disapprove of or you disagree with? Lead by example and all that.
$C: THANKS OBAMA!!

For setting up net neutrality 
$C: Can we get no changed to yesn't too
$C: Holee shit! Well done Reddit!
$C: Go suck a turd Ajit Pai
$C: Thank god...
$C: Well, "Won" is kind of a silly way to put it. 
You've won if you're for, you've lost if your against. 
$C: The battle is not over yet. 
$C: Voting FOR means they wanted to end net neutrality ?
$C: VortexLine for President!
$C: Why is there a lame picture of Ajit Pai to symbolize this victory?
$C: What about srs? 

(/s) 
$C: Such a shame...  I’m glad the right side won today💪
$C: Who is this "we"?
$C: Am Italian, so watching this from a distance. But I'm glad you Americans got your collective shit together and doing something to fix this! Kudos guys!!

And I love seeing Ajit Pai shat over! Keep it going!
$C: ajit pai L
$C: We?
$C: Show support to your senator if they voted to restore. More support than a corporation would
$C: Yay! Do I start the countdown to the next vote now?
$C: Can someone tldr why net neutrality is important 
$C: So onto important reddit news, when are you going to stop pushing that AWFUL new design on the old users? 

Yeah I'd like to see the old reddit whenever I open a new tab until I find your replacement.
$C: Nice?
$C: And what makes you think that the heavily Republican controlled House will vote for net neutrality, and that Trump won’t veto it?
$C: Cool, i didnt even have to pick up the phone.
$C: I am the Senate
$C: Can someone explain why so may were still against net neutrality?
$C: I'm Canadian and I'm still very happy to hear that net neutrality is restored for our American counterparts. 
$C: Hell yeah!
$C: We did it, Reddit!
$C: Barely, 2 more rounds to go
$C: Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
$C: Get this shit off Reddit. 
$C: FUCK YES
$C: Great!
$C: I don't want to be the downer in the group but this is not a win yet by any means. this still has to get through the house (whom I have heard majority are against it) and the president (which some will believe he will veto). There are too many hurdles to celebrate now. 
$C: Important not only for Americans, I must say
$C: Don't count your chicks before they hatch.
$C: Congratulations...


$C: Yay!
$C: WE DID IT REDDIT 4Head
$C: VICTORY!!!! WE HAVE VICTORY!!!!!!
$C: Not in the US, but wasn't this a complete waste of time, and nothing to do with net neutrality at all, just more party wrangling as elections are soon.  This has to pass the house does it not? Which ain't happening and even if it did Trump would likely Veto.

And even if all that passed FCC can just change it all again.

You don't have enough brave people on either side to meet in the centre with a compromise and a actual law change.
$C: Kudos to US, that's a great thing.
$C: Not allowing tiers
$C: And a big fuck you to ass hat pie
$C: Das it mane
$C: Except the government doesn't see Disneyland as a necessity and government assistance is available for internet service for low income homes
$C: Next step 89-0
$C: WE DID IT
$C: How many times , it has been . Big cable will be back , backed with 100 of millions of dollars 
$C: Cool.\-A happy Frenchman.
$C: I'm just waiting for Trump's veto and the incoming butthurt.
$C: I'm always scared of more government control, what is the benifit of government controlled internet?
$C: congrats and keep pushing on from your Irish friends x
$C: Nice
$C: This wont affect me but good for you american's.
$C: Next is Trump
$C: We shouldn't be even having this issue.
$C: This is amazing!
$C: so what your saying is, the Senate decided our fate?
$C: Title 2 isn’t that bad, maybe if it was fully repealed we could start rebuilding À la carte. Making revisions and improvements easier in the long term! 
$C: Name the people who voted against it!
$C: Another happy landing. 
$C: 52-47 is still really worrisome. This isn't over :(
$C: Whose we I didn’t think Reddit was exclusively American ?
$C: When does it go to the house for a vote?
$C: Super
$C: Nice
$C: https://youtu.be/b3djIU4DJoU
$C: Booyah
$C: congrats!!!!
$C: Well done USA
$C: This is great news.

Shame it was as close as 52\-47 to be saved though :\(
$C: YES
$C: Let's gooo!!! I'm ready to keep fighting too! Net Neutrality is something we desperately need with the market in it's current state. We don't need any more division of services between people.
$C: Amazing❤️
$C: Amerrrriiicccaaaa
$C: Good job 'murican brothers! We believe in you!
$C: *laughing* *in* *european*
$C: What can people outside of the US do to help the cause? 
$C: Awesome
$C: please mr ashit pile
$C: Good. Go suck a dick, Ajit.
$C: Isn't trump going to just Veto IF it even gets past the house...like im just being realistic i don't think trump will approve
$C: What a weird feeling. First time I've ever actively did something(contacted my senator) and I've seen results. 
$C: ootl is this good? 
$C: Pai, they want their money back.
$C: Congrats muricans :)
$C: VI VON
$C: Sweet!
$C: This is massive news! We shouldn't take our guard down just yet, but let's hope that we will stop this nonsense just like how we defeated SOPA. 
$C: I recommend that those whose representatives voted to keep net neutrality ahould call them and thank them
$C: nice
$C: fffFFFFFUCK YEAHHHHHH!!!
$C: Good lord, its a miracle. Did not think I'd wake up and see this!
$C: I am the senate
$C: And thus a whole lot of fucking panicking was incited by our own government because three shits on sticks were allowed to make decisions without the immediate oversight of our representative democracy, who were smart enough to ensure their stupid decision didn't actually bear fruit meanwhile, almost half of said representatives agreed with said stupid idea. Yay America!
$C: Good token
$C: Nice! Congrats, America.
$C: I still dont see the con side of the net neutraility argument, anyone care to explain?
$C: I love democracy
$C: good news! good luck for the next steps!
$C: Hip hip hooray 
$C: EYY congratz
$C: What are the main arguments *against* net neutrality? 
$C: I'm not even American but I'm pumped.
$C: So does this mean they aren't going to change everything in June? Saw an article a week or so ago that said something about it ending on June 11th. 
$C: Congrats! Nice results. 
$C: this gon be in the top of all time posts
$C: Finally, a good purpose for the take the L dance in fortnite. Suckit pai
$C: In yo face, pai face 
$C: A great battle has been won but not the war!
$C: Yeah!
$C: LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL (for agit pai)
$C: Suck it Ajit.
$C: Close call but great news regardless. 
$C: Oops! Looks like the corporate interests didn't spend enough money to buy enough votes to repeal this.
$C: Can we somehow make this show up every time someone types Ajit Pai. 
$C: Didnt win by much though! 
$C: Im not from America but this is great to hear.
$C: Yay!!!!!
$C: ##1 Victory Royale!
$C: We did it bois
$C: Just out of curiosity bc I'm out of the loop so to speak, what is the opposing sides arguments? I see no real reason. If the worst case scenario did happen, what is their goal?
$C: yay
$C: WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
$C: Amazing!
$C: I love democracy
$C: We are the senate.
$C: So the Donald has to approve this too. Interesting lol 
$C: On a serious note i would like to thank all you great amazing ass people for telling pajit plate or whatever his name is to fuck off
$C: [WE DID IT!](https://youtu.be/SBCw4_XgouA) REDDIT!
$C: Yah
$C: oh neat
$C: No, I won the vote.
$C: Can we get a list of the 47 who voted against. You know for the next time people are to vote.
$C: Cool. See you next year. 
$C: People need to let their house representatives both know that this is important to them and that you will NOT be voting for them again in any coming election if they vote against it. The only way US politicians serve their constituents is if they fear for their jobs. So if your representative votes against it, follow through and do not vote for them in response.
$C: I can't believe this is a partisian issue, it effects everyone equally
$C: as they say in ducktales: WOOHOO!
$C: I can honestly say, I did not see this happening.
$C: Finna woke 👌
$C: That’s 99 senators. Where the 100th?
$C: I have @netneutrality on instagram and idk what to do with it
$C: That's really nice. Its great to fight for internet rights.
$C: That said, trump can still veto this right? You know, to get paid by our wonderful isp's
$C: Yessss! the only thing that I ever took part in actually made a difference lol
$C: neat-o-mosquito 
$C: Even if the House goes along (which I frankly don't expect to happen since they're much more amenable to local corporate pressure), lotsa luck in getting Trump to sign it.
$C: Rejoice! 
$C: I'm so glad my state has been responsible for government officials such as Tom cotton and Huckabee.  

/s 
$C: Again? Theres also people from outside the US you know
$C: This was expected. It is going to die in the House.
$C: This is incredible!! :D
$C: Congratulations from the UK! This is a big win for all of us as many countries follow the US' precedent. :)
$C: We are ALL the Senate
$C: What is this we shit
$C: Soros must be happy. 
$C: Thank you guys from Europe. This was a good win :) 
$C: I don't want to be a downer but we expected this. We knew there were enough votes going in so yes, this is awesome. The real fight is in congress though. 

This bill is expected to be dead on arrival in congress and I hope you'll join me in calling your congressman and letting them know that this is our line in the sand. Reinstate Net Neutrality or we'll never let you forget how bad you fucked up. 
$C: DICKS OUT FOR NET NEUTRALITY!!!!  WE CAN DO THIS REDDIT!!!
$C: So 86% of all Americans want net neutrality right?  Why then did no Republicans vote to restore it?
$C: Not sure if you know how the American legislative process works, that’s not veto proof.
$C: Ok
$C: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjtYFctuas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjtYFctuas)
$C: Who did we flip?
$C: What are the chances that Trump won't Veto?
$C: Pai means dicks in Sinhalese. So eat a bag of dicks Ajit Pai.
$C: Good day for... tyranny
$C: I love democracy...
$C: I wouldn't say hearing us when  there was barely a 5 vote difference. The real enemy as those being bribed! 
$C: Disappointed - maybe if the internet was less accessible shit wouldn’t be so bad, just maybe
$C: This is amazing! Let's hope Net Neutrality stays!! :D
$C: That was the easiest part. Now we have to pass the house (much harder) and then Trump (oh boy...) So here's to hoping.
$C: Just a simple question. Now that it has been repealed, what bad things have happened that we were warned about?
$C: This is a political advertisement relating to US domestic politics. It doesn't belong as an announcement.

US domestic politics is mostly irrelevant for non-US Reddit users and you wouldn't post domestic political activism from our countries here.
$C: Ayy we did it reddit!
$C: I am the senate.
$C: take that ashit pie!
$C: I am the senate
$C: It's not just reddit who "did it". The entire internet did. 
$C: I called my Senators and asked them to lobby our state's representatives to vote to pass the House version of the bill.

Will they do it? Don't know. But I pointed out I would appreciate and remember their taking a leadership position in contacting our representatives.
$C: Down with the ObamaNet!!!  
$C: You're all so giddy for making the internet a utility like your water and power.
$C: Good job everyone. We did it. 

See you next month to do it again. 
$C: "Net Neutrality is the bipartisan protection of critical legislation necessary for securing the freedom of an open, bipartisan internet - Where everyone has a voice and everyone has a vote. Our votes will match our voice in one call to order. 

I support the reinstatement of Title II protections in the continued support of that spirit of individual freedom over corporate profit interests, that have moved to protect us all from greed and corruption. To the house of representatives, this is your one phone call. We won't be phoning it in on election day."
$C: Now if only guns were like this...
$C: YES! I think I just heard an angels' choir in the distance! 
$C: Potatoe face asshole must be very happy now. This ass can go to hell!
$C: yes
$C: What is the plan for after the president vetos this?
$C: Not sure who "we" are but ok, let's see what the house does
$C: How did -47 people vote against it
$C: Now if we can start rebuilding out international trade agreements and not destroy everything america had.
$C: Yeet
$C: too bad the house is 100% corrupt and evil. also, orange bastard will just veto it like the good putin puppet he is.
$C: While I'm really excited for these results, a part of me thinks they are giving us a battle victory so they can win the war.

They know it requires the House of Reps and White House to be fully restored, and they are almost absolutely sure it won't pass those gateways.

Therefore, this is a way for them to not look like the "bad guys" in the public eye.

Maybe it's the cynic in me, but this seems like the most realistic scenario to me. 

This could actually be a few of the **36 Strategems**:

"Deceive the heavens to cross the ocean"

"Conceal a dagger in a smile"

"Cut down the plum tree to save the peach tree"

"Hold out a brick to attract a gem"

"Inflict injury on oneself to win the enemy's trust"
$C: This is an actual PogChamp. #WEDIDITREDDIT
$C: Great...White House.
$C: Unless both Houses pass the bill by 2/3 vote, to override Presidential Veto, it will be for naught.
$C: America has once again come together and achieved something incredible
$C: Oof 
$C: Yuppyyyy the government can control the internet over and over again!!
$C: Suck on that Ajit Pai
$C: I'm so happy I could cry. I really, really didn't think they were going to push this through. Little bit of faith in Democracy restored.
$C: Does the final decision come down to Trump? 
$C: Fuck you Paiboy
$C: I'm from Australia and I was just wondering why all the republicans voted against it? Is there a view that having no net neutrality benefits anyone?
$C: Nothing more American then having our elected officials do things that 80&#37; of us dont want. 

Dont forget to vote in the mids come November to remove these politicians that wont listen to their people!
$C: too narrow a margin for my taste, but way to go
$C: Hooray time to get drunk, watch movies, play games, and be all over reddit to celebrate! 
$C: That's awesome!!
$C: Still have yet to hear a good thing explaining why it matters. It didn't exist until Obama, yet nothing really changed? 
$C: So glad we’re letting the US Government decide the fate of the Internet. *dab* 
$C: wooo
$C: We won the battle now lets win the war
$C: Awww cute
 Americans thinking that what the Senate does has any bearing on the outcome of this. 


$C: Will you be making a thread for the House of Representatives vote as well?
$C: Ok Reddit. Now time to save the Expanse. 
$C: I am the senate.
$C: Nooo I don’t want the government getting involved with the internet
$C: YAY OMG OMG
$C: Thank fucking god. 
$C: Can we make a tread for something similar along the lines of torturing citizens with directed energy weapons.

Or make progress towards instantiating federal law against their use?

https://www.biggerthansnowden.com
$C: Congratulations on the [victory](https://2oddsblog.wordpress.com/)
$C: Who was the slacker who didn't vote, or am I just out of the loop?
$C: You do not know what you have done.
$C: Nice!!!! I hope pai is sucking a nice big dirty dick right now 
$C: For the most hated guy in America , people really vote for the opposite of making their lives better
$C: SUCK IT AJIT
$C: We didn't win yet guys, there has to be a vote in Congress and it will most likely die there. 
$C: Whoa, how did that happen?
$C: There is a major issue with internet service in Canada now, a country which prides itself on the strictest enforcement of net neutrality. A few companies \(Rogers, Bell, Telus, Shaw\) have captured the market through bribery of the cities, and regulatory capture of the CRTC. This has lead to artificially high cell phone and broadband internet prices across the board, and substandard service for the middle tier internet packages \(throttling\).

In my experience, from 2011 to 2013 our house's connection was being throttled constantly. In pro net neutrality Canada, here I was struggling to maintain a stable connection for a video game that at best used 5\-10 kbps, being called a "warper" by everyone. I also couldn't get a reasonable latency at all, every city's servers were between 90\-120ms. It was only when upgrading to the second highest internet plan, that I had the privilege of playing a game that was optimized for a DSL connection somewhat smoothly.

And on the topic of bandwidth usage and it's price, there will never be a market price for bandwidth. Koodo can say that the physical cost of 1GB is $20, Telus and Rogers can say it's $15, Bell can say it's $40, and they're all wrong. Unless anyone with capital can enter the market and offer a competing service for a lower price, there is no such thing as a market price, only the winners of government regulation set the prices. Being forced to pay absurd prices in the name of a bandwidth scarcity by design isn't much better then what exists now.

That brings us to the CRTC, which supposedly aims to regulate the telecom market into fairness for Canadian consumers, but as usual accomplishes the opposite. The requirements for a company are not only excessively bureaucratic, they require that 50&#37; of the company must be Canadian owned. This is meant to exclude as many foreign buyers as possible, and keep the big 4 from being forced to improve their service or lower prices. It's kind of similar to how only Canadian companies are allowed to fly domestic routes, which keeps companies like West Jet and Air Canada at the top, since no one other than smaller Canadian airlines can compete. Cities also play their part, as is well known in the US, by making sure that potential startups have an unfair disadvantage when it comes to "land use" laws. Give the Mayor and City council a nice bribe, and all of a sudden they're raving about environmental and safety standards, delaying any attempt to build new infrastructure.

Unfortunately, I don't think it's going to get better here. High download speeds and upload speeds will still be accessible for the highest packages, but the packages will still be expensive across the board, consumers will still not be able to choose what they want to pay for \(more bandwidth or less, lower latency or average etc\), and latency ever decreasing over the decades is now a sad joke. In my mind, it could be 2030, 2040 or 2050, and as long as the incentives are still the same, as long as there is no competition, as long as they can get away with bribing municipal governments, as long as the CRTC exists, the only options that exist will be 6 inches, 8 inches and 10 inches plus an additional fee of $15 for the lube.
$C: Lol you can have a big democracy cake walk right through the middle of Tienanmen square and it won't make a lick of difference. You know why? 'Cause the White House has the bomb. And once it gets to the White House, this is just gonna blow up in our faces. The orange man in charge will never let this go through. 

$C: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA SO SAD!
$C: Yay! Propaganda won today! 
$C: But in all actuality it’s really not gonna change anything to end it, it’s not the big end to the internet if it’s gone. The internet existed before net neutrality

$C: Ummm...how is this a victory?
“Net Neutrality” isn’t neutral at all.  It restricts deregulated business practice (i.e. free market i.e. competition to monopolies that abuse consumers) and gives control of our controlling body (ICANN) to a foreign body.

Net Neutrality is a DISASTER to a free and open internet.
$C: To bad DC has already stated the house won't bring this to the floor. Kinda of doa. And the only reason the Senate voted on it was because of the upcoming vote on election for them.

https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/16/611598361/senate-approves-overturning-fccs-net-neutrality-repeal
$C: Rob Portman from ohio, a Republican voted with industry against net neutrality. Sherrod Brown a Democrat, voted for net neutrality. This should be remembered in the next election in Ohio.
$C: Thanks for the update
$C: I think its time to put him down
$C: Who's going to be writing the rules for this legislation?
$C: Easy cowboy, it still has to get through the house. 
$C: Hell yeah! Oh man I was so stressed about this thank god
$C: Don't stop yet. We need to basically yell in trump's ears that we want Net Neutrality, just keep yelling "this is your one chance to make us happy, so keep the Net safe ~~and fire pai~~ and keep Net neutrality (the internet) great"
$C: We need to send some thank you mail to the 52 that voted yes. They missed out on a lot of money to protect our freedom. The least we could do is say thanks.
$C: Great! Now let’s vote to hang the Commies Trying to get rid of This Freedom 
$C: Now we need to vote out the 47 who wanted to get rid of net neutrality.
$C: I’m so proud to be a Redditor right now.
$C: Y’all should be pushing for an Internet Bill of Rights 
$C: Serious questions: Isn't it still possible that Trump may veto this? Also, what happens with that shit-fucker Ajit in terms of this? Does he still retain his position?
$C: The first piece of good news out of politics since what like feels like forever.
$C: Men, I'm not from the US, but I'm so glad. That's great news! Keep it up!
$C: This guy is like herpes.. he keeps coming back
$C: Yes!
$C: If this makes it through the house, will anything actually change, or does it just prevent potential future problems? 
$C: Is there a way to see how each senator voted?
$C: I think it's better if the states get to decide this. It really shouldn't be a federal issue. Though a lot of things shouldn't be.
$C: Endgame is veto
$C: You should do a pie chart of the results 
$C: Neat. Wonder when they'll try again.
$C: Well, I'm happy for you Americans! Now when I move down there, I'll be able to browse Reddit and 4chan!
$C: For now, still have a long way to go. This was just a battle. The war ain't over yet. 
$C: Why does it feel like it's so much easier to fuck something up than it is to fix it?

This is the first step on a long road, but it took one man to snap his fingers to put us here in the first place.
$C: grab your sword fight the horde
$C: Cant say you won until it goes past Reps and White House which Im sure it will die at the Reps
$C: http://reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8i3382/orangered_alert_the_senate_is_about_to_vote_on/dyomqou

So we're a third of the way to cancelling the redesign!
$C: Pie boi scumbag piece of shit
$C: It's nice that the Senate voted this way...but as long as Republicans control the House and White House, there's no way this is getting reversed.  Trump installed this scumbag at FCC specifically to roll back any and all consumer protections.  Same as at every other government agency and department.
$C: Awesome to hear this. Had better luck making floppy turtle soup with my congressman then getting him to vote in his constituents interests. Can Kentuckians please vote this douche out this time?
$C: Because you want to be arbiter of what people see instead of leaving it to different companies.
$C: DARKTEAM Player Summary
GENERAL DARKTEAM
$C: Can groups sue Comcast for interfering in the vote process if they can prove The company only increased payment up to and after a vote on the issue?  That would prove intent.
$C: How do we vote?
$C: But...but...I’m already dead from the initial repeal.  Does this mean I’m back now?
$C: Great, but I’m still concerned over the 47 pricks who didn’t vote to restore the rules. 
$C: Has anyone ever thought that if Comcast and Verizon and the Government were for something such as net neutrality, this may not be such a good thing as Reddit is letting on?
$C: Aaaa maaan 
$C: The House will kill this just to watch it die.
$C: 52/-47 is still too close for comfort
$C: Sweet
$C: The president is probably going to veto it tho
$C: K
$C: In all likelihood this won't pass the house BUT THATS OKAY. If this matter is important to you then take note of who voted in favor of overturning the FCC and vote for them in the midterms. If your senator didn't vote in favor then go ahead and vote them out if this topic matters to you. The same goes for the house: keep those who vote yes and remove those who go no.
$C: What are the odds that trump lets this pass though? He's the one who appointed Pai after all.
$C: Why is this such a partisan issue?
$C: Ok, but why would you not link to the ACTUAL legislation that passed the senate? Why only link to a feel-good story on some ad-revenue driven website?

Oh that's right Wired's owned by Condé Nast Publications and so is Reddit.

$C: #hi
$C: NNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
$C: Hooray! At leas we did it!!!!
$C: President won't sign it.
$C: Why do we think the government can make better decisions than we can? This is shit..

$C: Take that Ajit Pai
$C: Hell yea! Suck it Ajiit or whatever the hell your name is! 
$C: A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one!
$C: This means I can still browse Reddit!
$C: I need to see pies reaction, i just need it
$C: A surprise to be sure but a welcome one!
$C: Live long and suck it, Ajit Pai. More power to Redditors! <3
$C: wow nice 
$C: good
$C: Yes because reddit single handedly did this...
$C: Lets celebrate this victory with the redditors' favorite beverage: FREE SOY FOR EVERYONE!! :DDDD
$C: I love democracy 
$C: Can someone explain why this would *not* pass in the House? If the Senate is supposed to represent the people just like the House is, why would you expect 2 different results?
$C: Why do all the republicans vote against? Not trying to sound mean. Just want to know what their thoughts on the topic are and why they choose differently to democrats.
$C: Awww.... No public shaming? 
$C: Big win for us all!
$C: Fuck you Ashit Pie.
$C: Cool! We won the thing that we were supposed to win. I still don't really get what it is.
$C: So the chances of getting Net Neutrality fully restored are almost definite right?
$C: > *today’s vote demonstrated that our Senators are hearing us.*

Or they voted this way because they know it doesn't stand a chance in the House.
$C: That’s very unfortunate. Net neutrality is a bad thing for America.
$C: Why is it important?
$C: What are the odds this makes it through the House and White House
$C: We are one step closer to winning!
$C: Ha! Suck it!
$C: Yeet
$C: Well, my thoughts are that I'm deeply glad we keep The Net Neutrality. I just hope it lasts forever lol
$C: Who was the deciding vote? Which state senator?
$C: Why do we want the government regulating the internet?
$C: YES! THIS IS 0NE F0R THE B00KS!
$C: When you say "WE" I have to assume that you are invested in the global internet conglomerates who helped craft the net neutrality rules that effectively create legal monopolies for tech giants like Google, Facebook and cable companies and strips rights and powers from their customers and users.  

Congrats... and good luck getting it through the white house.
$C: 🤘👍😢
$C: Thank God everything seems to be working out without me having to do anything. 
$C: Amazing news!!!
$C: LETS GOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
$C: Wait wait wait. I thought according to twitter, reddit, and facebook that we lost net neutrality for good. That the fight was over and there weren't any more avenues the decision had to go through. 
$C: Why was literally the only people against it Republicans? Whats their deal? Thank god the Democratic Party didn’t vote against it.
$C: This is great but you have to wonder who gave bureaucrats the right to take those decisions away from you in the first place 😮
$C: Wont make it though, lets be honest. 
$C: The energy spent on Net Neutrality would be better spent on the impeachment of Trump, Net Neutrality won't live as long as he is in office. 
$C: Congrats Americans 
$C: booooooo. wont pass house you morons 
$C: I am the senate!
$C: Take that ajit pi
$C: Fuck you ajit pai, your plans have failed! Mwahhahahahaha!
$C: Goodbye municipal ISPs that could have solved this issue for posterity, and actually started to sprout out as result of FCC's decision, hello more government control that can be undone by flick of a pen.
$C: Would it help to spread a list of all those who voted no all over the internet in the Hope's that they would be voted out of office.   Regardless of their differences I'm sure that most conservatives and liberals favor a free and open high speed internet 
$C: Well, this still doesn't fix Reddit
$C: As someone who wants to explain this to my dad and is still having trouble comprehending,
 what we just accomplished?

$C: Woop woop
$C: The biggest problem is going to get the head orange not to veto this if it does pass through the house.  He's already mentioned his support for removing NN.
$C: So, since the we won the Net Neutrality vote in the Senate, dos that mean that the FCC's Net Neutrality repeal is frozen/paused until the house votes on it, or can Trump/Pai's FCC still technically kill Net Neutrality, wile the house get's ready to decide when to vote to send it to Trump to sign and make the veto official law?
$C: HURRAH!

$C: WOOHOOOOOO
$C: HELL YEA!! AFTER A SHITTY DAY TODAY, I FEEL ALIVE AND WELL.  THERE'S A SILVER LINING IN EVERY CLOUD. 
$C: The thing is they will keep reappearing it time n again. When ppl feels its safe n voting goez down that's when it would hit.

$C: The House is going to shit on this. get fucked
$C: Thats shocking and amazing.
$C: Net Neutrality is not neutral at all in its current format. It was written by special interest to only benefit the special interest.

I don’t want Google, Yahoo, Facebook and others controlling or owning the internet.

I’m for the concept of Net Neutrality but you just can’t just call something neutral to make it neutral.

It’s like the affordable care act, I’m for the concept of affordable care but the affordable care act is anything but affordable.

Net Neutrality is another con job left over from the previous administration. It’s a brain wash.

Sorry to burst people’s bubbles but it’s true.
$C: Won a battle but you gonna lose the war.  
$C: "We"
$C: Fart and away the best thing the senate has done in a while.
$C: fuck yeah , keep on the pressure! to the houuuuuuse!
$C: When has government regulation helped people?  Rent control did the opposite by limiting the number of rental spaces available, etc.   I say let the market figure it out.   If a Telco starts screwing with customers, another Telco will appear to take over.  The market will correct itself if left to it own without government regulation 
$C: NO WAY! THIS IS A DAY FOR REJOICE!
$C: We did it reddit
$C: Thank God.
$C: Share the news with everyone you can!!! Make sure they vote this fall and make sure they write to their representatives!!!
$C: Of course, Cohens “consulting” didn’t work out.
$C: This just made my day. :') 
$C: Eat a dick Ajit! 
$C: but we won nothing b/c the house is going to do nothing
$C: I don’t know about you, but it seems to me the world just got a little bit less fucked.
$C: If the Net Neutrality vote was not enough, please be aware of who you going to vote for Midterm election 2018. Take note that the election isn't just applied specifically to the Federal Level. It will also apply for the state level, respectively.

 In fact, not only I see some politicians that want to restore the Net Neutrality rule, they are willing to offer community broadband service that is said to offer heavy competition and offer more choice for ISP instead of sticking to just one ISP at a single given time.
$C: Fucked up that it was almost 50 50 
$C: I dont think your understandinto my argument here. The main concern I have here is under the 2015 change for is rules was that they had to provide the same speed allocation across all websites nomater what they were. Now lets say they want to save money on expanding there infrastructure all they need to do is withold websites access to bandwidth while charging comsumers the same amount for slower access to some websites. Now in exchange for money they give acces to fast lanes. NN wouldnt stop isps from charging consumers more for faster internet. It stops them from having the power to chose what people get to see at those speeds they pay for. Or am I wrong
$C: YES were one step closer.Lets keep this success going. 
$C: Nigga we made it
$C: We did it! [you can laugh here.](https://imgur.com/a/lPJU9kk)
$C: So many people on Reddit are so ready to willingly give up their rights to the government. Very scary times we live in.

$C: Phew. I thought Facebook was going to cost 100 bucks a month like Reddit told me. Glad that won’t happen.
$C: They are gonna keep trying in any way possible until we give up :/ a bill that cannot be overridden needs to be enacted
$C: Now fix Reddit
$C: nice
$C: I'm sure Pai, aka ISP's most dutiful puppet, was not happy about this. This is proof the people's voices, when joined, can actually matter.
$C: I wish I could help in any way, it sucks that people outside of USA can do nothing... But to all of you who can do something: don't give up your struggle and keep fighting! People all around the globe are rooting for you, including me c:

$C: qanon
$C: I'm from Spain, but anyway, great news for us too, we were a little bit scared of us being the next \(Europe\), I saw in December I think it was the live stream when they voted for the net neutrality and that was a shame... worst stream I've ever seen, for sure xD, now I'm happy that net neutrality won, I'm happy for everyone, it should always be neutral. 
$C: Allahu Akbar!
The U.S. must take Monroe Doctrine now.

$C: Now we have sad Ashit Pai.
$C: This is a b.s. tactic to keep it tabled as long as possible. The fact that it's reached this point means it's dead. Just more than likely not now.
$C: Great!
$C: Net neutrality is dumb af
$C: Any small win is huge at this point... we need to do what we can... keep fighting!
$C: Keep fighting!
$C: Oh God my heartbeat goes up!
$C: I wouldn't celebrate yet, we are starting to move this huge boulder with our combined strengths but this isn't over until it's over

$C: Lol.
$C: Congratulations to all of us
$C: Is net neutrality the placement of additional restrictions on how an ISP and sell access to their private network?  It seems like the name "neutrality" might be misleading.
$C: Net Neutrality was an executive branch decision and given the margin it's being turned down, I'm concerned for the White House vote which will almost certainly veto it.

It doesn't seem like a 2/3 majority in the House and Senate would be possible.
$C: I'm not gonna say whether I'm for or against it, but I highly doubt it will make it past the House of Representatives.
$C: Wait this actually worked?
$C: Can
$C: The worst decision was the appointment by Trump for this FCC director.  Oh, I agree with less regs, however, this joker did not do his homework on the relative good and bad - a political hack by Trump to hack anything-Obama.  Well, in this case, this rule actually protects the consumers, keeps corporations in check, and maintains a system for "open internet".
$C: This was kept quiet! #GoodNews
$C: Soo...did the House specifically (and deliberately) just ignore Net Neutrality?  Cause I heard nothin.

> The FCC just officially gutted the open internet. Now your cable company can scam you for more money, censor websites, and slow down online content. **But Congress can still stop this. We already won in the Senate. Contact your House reps now!** 
$C: GG

$C: I just left a Verizon store where I overheard an employee explain to a customer in NYC that the reason her service is slow in the city is because some people/ corporate customers have a better unlimited plan than she did. So the throttling has begun and our access to the internet depends on how much we pay. I fought long and hard on Twitter to get Net Neutrality.  

I knew Net Neutrality would be one of the first casualties of Republican control.  How can we help? 
$C: Well insanity wins again!   A two year old law and you make it sound like you saved the world.  Did you ever wonder how the Internet thrived with out government intervention.   Or is that a question that's too hard to take.  Comcast  supports it, that should scare the he'll out of everyone! 
$C: Woo, net neutrality us aeesom..!
$C: Okay. Now can you stop advertising for Comcast, you shills?
$C: I am EXTREMELY LATE on this, but how is it 52-47? Did one senator not vote?
$C: A lot of internet pioneers are against NN bcos less profit=less innovation.
"Computer scientist Bob Kahn[148] has said net neutrality is a slogan that would freeze innovation in the core of the Internet."
$C: Dig the trenches, reload the meme-machineguns and repair the subreddit shitpost's tracks, the worst is yet to come
$C: So much madness in America, we are crazy
$C: u/mdtv_veter
$C: It's a small step in the process, but a much needed and required step.

As mentioned, it will require it to go through the house.  I see no issues here.  Then it goes to Trump.  I expect Trump to veto it.  Once veto'd, it goes back to the house and senate where a 2/3 majority vote will be required to over-rule the veto.  

If the process fails anywhere, it'll be in trying to override the veto.  The Senate will need to sway 14 additional votes beyond the 52 that have already voted for it, to get their 2/3's in.  I'm extremely curious to see how this does in the House.  The House, could make up for the Senate's 14 votes.
$C: cool 
$C: This is fake news.. Net neutrality is not neutral at all. It's like saying planned Parenthood is good for the unborn. 
$C: This is so good. Alexa play despacito 2
$C: Congrats fucknuts. We lose.
$C: Ayy lmao 😂👌
$C: Nice work!
$C: Nice
$C: I think this whole thing is just so broken. People are elected to represent the people who got them elected. Unless I'm missing something, nobody but the communication companies is excited for this.

$C: I'm so proud of Alabama for voting in a dem. for the first time in 25 years. Richard Shelby is an old ass fart who's essentially indoctrinated into the senate seat because he's been there forever. I cannot wait to move out of the state. I'm so tired of the back country, racist, cousin-lovin' hicks I have to deal with every damn day! 
$C: yay!
$C: Republicans will kill this in the house.

Failing that, the worst leader in the history of humanity will veto.

Both sides are not the same. Stop voting Retard.
$C: Can't wait for you liberals to lose in the House 
$C: wooHOO
$C: Hooray
$C: Taco time
$C: Cool
$C: hooray
$C: The vote is too close!!! and you know these greedy bums in DC will continue pushing against it..
$C: Rand Fucking Paul. Who would have thought Libertarian Rand Paul would be against citizens' fair access to the internet. The hypocrisy is just *bon_appetit_muah.gif*
$C: I have Crapcast's slowest most inexpensive account..   

we have no other broadband in my area  

Its grandfathered in you cant order it anymore on new accounts

 I pay $39 a month for 3mbit .. its all I can afford  

if what you idiots are doing pushes the price of my account up  

you can suck my chicken flavored.. d
$C: Net Neutrality is like all the other liberal movements. The exact opposite of what it says on the tin. 

Planned Parenthood, HIV... I could go on 
$C: Fucking idiots, ISP's should not be regulated by the 1936 FCC title II regulations.

Proves how easily manipulated this country is by the Hyper corporations.
$C: On behalf off the non-US internet users:
Thank you activists! 

Nice to see there are still american politicians who are not swayed nu the dollar and/or like the concept off common sense.

Good to see it still works to do something for the greater good. For the general population as a whole.

Why do I care as a non-US citizen? This affects companies who operate worldwide. For example. My Netflix subscribtion fee will go up if costs in the US go up because some corrupt official I did not vote for makers a shady decision. (I know you didn't vote for him either, but almost half of you die vote for the guy who put him there).

Its really irritating that you guys let your system get so bloated by corporate money. It affects more than just US citizens. And last time I checked your country and mine (the Netherlands) Are still friends and share history. (Trying to overlook the reality tv host presidential actions of late).

TLDR:
Thank you activists on behalf off the non US people who are affected but have no direct influance.
$C: 🎉🎉🎉🎉
$C: A big victory, but the fight is far from over.  The next steps will be even harder to accomplish.
$C: Gotta go through the house now
$C: Oh good, I hope it goes well, my fists have gotten tired punching a picture of Ajit on my wall. X(
$C: I can't imagine how regular people think net neutrality should be gone. "The Internet isn't neutral. without net neutrality Internet providers will be held accountable for what they provide"  also your Internet bill will probably skyrocket and need to pay extra for certain websites or even have no access to them altogether. 
$C: DONT CELEBRATE YET. ITS NOT OVER.
they could have let it slide on purpose hoping most of us will let it slip and it will get shut down later. Also, they could have just set it up with Trump to get veto'd, there was never any risk, nothing has happened.
$C: If this shit passes other country's will follow too, this isn't just a victory for the US but around the globe.
$C: Congrats! I've been watching all of this unfold from New Zealand, and I wish the best for the next votes
$C: The Republican party is the party of Comcast. Period. Fuck the GOP. Fuck Trump. And, of course, fuck Ajit Pai...
$C: I called and did my best! Let me know what we can do! Can I somehow inform my neighborhood without annoying everyone?
$C: thanks to Democrats. want to keep meet neutrality ? vote the Republicans that voted against net neutrality OUT this November
$C: I'm so proud of Reddit and everyone who called their congressman, shared posts on social media and raised awareness. It's amazing what we can accomplish as a unified front. This battle is not over and I hope we can continue what we've started. 
$C: Kind of funny how many people fell for this. Once again giving the giants power, you claim freedom as you throw it away. 2+2 = 5
$C: This shit again...
$C: The House won't back it. It's filled with Trumptard Republifascits who idiot white trash vote into office again and again.
$C: Congratulations, US people for this amazing demonstration of the effectiveness of lived democracy! It's great to see that politicians are not solely steered by lobbyists and companies.

By the way, could you make use of your newly discovered power to, you know, save the world from your president? 
$C: EAT A DICK AJIT

FUCK YEEEEAAAAH BOIIIIIIIIIIIII
$C: Why the fuck would you want the big clunky inefficient machine that is our government to regulate the internet? It boggles my mind! 
$C: The real problem with US politics is that we have a two\-party win\-or\-lose system, which makes politics a game, and makes people of different parties hate each other.  If we ever want good government, we're going to have to change our system, to motivate people to work together to make things better for everyone.  

We could use modern technology to make a better system.  Instead of having elections, we could let people vote any time they felt like it, any day or night of any year.  Each politician would simply stay in office till they got voted out.  And people could change their votes any time they wanted to.  We could require a certain number of votes to vote someone in, and a certain number to vote someone out, such that the changes wouldn't happen too frequently, but would happen frequently enough that the voters would have real control over which politicians would be in office.  

Issues like Net Neutrality shouldn't have to compete with other issues to get politicians' attention.  If we had a good system, all important issues would be seriously considered by all politicians.
$C: Let´s be honest guys, a 52-47 vote is way to close for comfort. The fact that 47 people are still advocating against Net Neutrality is still a scary fact and we should focus on educating and informing these 47 people and their following. 
$C: Yes! We did it, Reddit!

Now let's secure Net Neutrality and undo more damage! We CAN do it!
$C: Ajit Pai, more like

E A T S H I T A N D D I E
$C: Best part is a majority of the people who say no to this have no idea what it actually entails. They just see red and post "Obama got m'uh internets all fucked" to r/the_sub_that_shall_not_be_named_because_honestly_it_shouldnt_exist
$C: Why should my mom, who uses the internet for email every other day or so, have to pay the same for internet as somebody who is playing Fortnite, streaming music, downloading 4k 3d porn and streaming The Office on Netflix for background noise?
$C: [deleted]
$C: We won the great nerf war against Ajit
$C: Images of Ajit gnashing his enormous piano-key teeth in frustration.
$C: 👉😎👉ZOOP👉😎👉
$C: Good job everyone! I like to believe that we as a group make a difference!
$C: All you guys care about us your profits. Looks like you won't have to help maintain the infrastructure after all.. He convenient 
$C: > We did it, Reddit!

lol no
$C: Raise a glass to freedom

They'll tell the story of tonight
$C: Saying "we won" is going to cause many to become complacent. This war is far from over. This vote was just a ploy to win favor in the mid terms because they fear a blue wave.  
$C: Yay! We beat Shit Pie for the US senate on Net Neutrality!
$C: Glad to see Sheev came through 
$C: Do we have a list of the 47 fuckers who voted nay?
$C: I did it! Yay!
$C: That’s one small step for a senate, one giant leap for Reddit-kind.
$C: The House will probably kill it and if they don’t our mango in chief will veto it. Greed will win out in the end. 
$C: Ew there’s A shit pie
$C: Come on Trump, sign it, you’re a man of the people.
$C: That’s not possible because I AM THE SENATE!
$C: 47 fucking Senators actually voted no.  Thats the real take away here. That many are ready to sell us out.  That is until they of course get charged a fee for their campaign websites to be displayed...
$C: Now we have to get rid of 47 senators. 
$C: Let's fucking go EZ PZ !
$C: As mod of /r/familyman, I approve
$C: I have a problem with this post because there are bound to be skimmers who won't fully read a post. They will see the title and jump to the conclusion that we have won. Obviously it says the senate, meaning the house is next, but for people who don't understand politics they think the issue is over. Atleast this issue is in the front page
$C: As a trump supporter it does sadden me to fathom it'll get shot down at the WH. I am pretty outspoken about the little twat ajit is....
$C: It’s like this is an mmo and the last boss fight will be trump.......
It’s gonna be a hard fought battle.
$C: Ajit pai I hope this makes you want to cry.
$C: Who is "we"? 
$C: The fact it's only a 5 vote margin shows how corrupt America really is. A victory, yes, but still shows how much work we need to do to remove our corrupted officials.
$C: This will not pass the House. Net neutrality is not what you think it is.
$C: Ajit has nothing to be smug about anymore!
$C: What a lot of people don't realise that with so much of the English speaking internet housed in the U.S. , Net neutrality can affect the world. As a non American, I applaud and appreciate the efforts of everyone fighting this fight. With you in spirit, my brave brothers and sisters in arms.
$C: With all due consideration, Mr. Pai can eat a ripe sack of shit. I'm glad he got defeated. Shame on him for trying to sell the people he should be working for to billionaires.
$C: Ajit's gonna go cry to Momma Verizon's wallet
$C: Or lost, because people have different opinions and nothing is black and white?
$C: What is this “we” bullshit?
$C: I have to stop. I just spent way to long upvoting every single comment.
$C: “We” won?
$C: I want Ajit Pai removed from office as well.

He is a civil servant and not a civil master.

He has shown nothing but contempt for the American public.
$C: Congratulations from Argentina! I'm so happy for all of you! 
$C: Let's not lie to ourselves.

The House will reject this.
$C: You're welcome everyone. I worked hard for your freedom.
$C: Net Neutrality FOREVER! #PowerInNumbers 
$C: this shit is nothing more than a bunch of stupid AF political theater.

the House is just a glorified loony bin compared to the Senate.  GL getting it past them and then convincing the King of the Loons to sign it.  



$C: This isn’t over. There’s still the House and President to go through…
$C: This is a huge win for all Americans in the name of freedom of speech.
$C: I mean, it’s great that we won back net neutrality and all... but did anyone even notice it being gone? I didn’t.
$C: This is premature. You climbed a small hill. There are fuckingn mountains left to climb
$C: Get out and vote this year folks so we don't have to keep fighting for this
$C: you're dumb as fuck, the full house majority has to approve it, LELELEELLELELLEELELELLE. Net Neut is fucking cancer, so fuck off and suck a dick
$C: Take that pai 
You fucking scum bags 
$C: Now if only we can get net neutrality on reddit 
$C: We did it, reddit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
$C: Suck it Ajit Pai. I'm not even American, but this still makes me happy.
$C: evil failed thank god
$C: So if it goes through every part in the government and the white hours does that mean no one can re appeal or go after net neutrality again?
$C: Great, I'm sure Reddit will do what's good for the internet. 
$C: Best of luck getting this through the House.

$C: Good.  Fuck the GOP.
$C: Would someone care to explain why Net Neutrality is important besides the obvious "It prevents throttling, etc"

Before Net Neutrality, everything was fine before that.  So why is it a big deal now?
$C: Nice
$C: This is fantastic, never saw that coming. 
$C: Damn. I was enjoying death due to the loss of it. 
$C: This is very simple.  Computer people need to use the same template as NRA or abortion nuts.  Vote out anyone who is against the internet.  
$C: FUCK YOU AJIT 
$C: Fix. Yeah we *are* the senate 
$C: When are we hanging our 'mission accomplished' banner?
$C: Is the Ajit Pai bashing over yet?
$C: what if drumpfy shoots it down? can he?
$C: Considering the support that Reddit continues to give to the Republican agenda, I don't think you get to claim this victory.
$C: Totally going to make this political, because it is; every democrat voted for this and only three republicans. This is a party line issue
$C: Awesome! So what can I do to keep helping the fight?
$C: Christ doesn’t care about net neutrality.. open the good book folks and let’s bow our heads in his glory for 20 minutes today
$C: Lol we won nothing. It will fail in the house and you all will continue to believe “peaceful” protest will change anything. Violence is coming whether you want it to or not.
$C: I am surprised that some many people trust the gov't over free market capitalism. This legislation just gives the gov't more power, which means the citizen has less.
$C: lol.

Pointless grand standing. Trump will never sign the bill.

Hollow Victories. Right up the Democrat's 'feel good', '0 practicality' attitude about everything.

We independents find you ridiculous. The Republicans, well, they're laughing at you.
$C: i guess that's good news. 

i don't get why there were so many different voting periods on this issue.

Like, if this passes; can't they bring up another vote to get rid of it later? isn't that what was done 'till pro-neutrality guys got their way?
$C: Every day I log in, and every day I have to choose "go back to old Reddit". Are you guys sure that people who are so pathetically bad at their job winning is a good thing?
$C: Jezus, 47 of your senators still voted in favour of banning Net Neutrality... That's messed up
$C: Who voted against it and why? That is way to close of a call. Who are these people and how can we fuck with them?
$C: Non American signing in. First off if they won but why does it still have to go through the house and WH? I though this vote shut down changing the law for NN or is it to reverse it to old state? Also is there anything we can do from the outside to help?
$C: It’s probably too early to say, but once again, fuck you Ajit Fuckin Pai, and your fucky teeth. 

That felt good. 
$C: Well, the evil Republicans can *hear* you. They're just not listening. They never will.
$C: Wishes you good luck, fellow Americans.

$C: We're safe... for now. 
$C: Can you out the 47 who voted against it? We should get them out of office since they clearly don't care about the people
$C: THAT CURRY EATIN COW LOVER JUST GOT KACHOWED
$C: And what of Ajit? Can we do anything to him or does he still sit on his high horse?
$C: There were still 47 votes though which is saddening
$C: Pai must be ajitting himself.
$C: Can we shut up about it now? 
$C: Thank god for the Democrats.
$C: Excellent news. The next order of business should be getting Ajit Pai voted out of his position.
$C: I mean, if it has to go through the White House, doesn't that mean Trump? Who will probably just say "fuck you". Sorry for the defeatist attitude, but if the president has the final say, isn't all of this kinda pointless? Still great, you guys got that far, but yeah... it's an honest question by the way, so keep your flaming to yourself.
$C: That margin is scary. Stay alert. Organized greed defeats disorganized democracy. 
$C: That margin is scary. Stay alert. Organized greed defeats disorganized democracy.

$C: I have a feeling baby Trump will whine and say Obama made net Neutrality, meanwhile he wanted to kill it too. 
$C: I'm so confused on why Murkowski and Collins are still Republicans 
$C: Let’s hope it doesn’t stop at Trump with a suitcase of FCC bribes
$C: Too bad the house is just gonna vote it down, and if it does pass, trump will 100% veto it 
$C: Cheers from across the pond 'Muricans!
$C: This is terrific news. Now we have to wait for the House vote.
$C: As a libertarian, I don't think Net neutrality is needed.

I want less state power over the Internet. Not more.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Or it’s important to people who have been lied to and overpowered by spam from people like you.  
$C: Sorry to rain on everyone's parade, but the House is chokefull of stupid right now. It's packed with trumpists and crazed right wingers. There's very little chance that something similar would pass there.
$C: #**WOOOOOOOOOO**

^^^I ^^^mean... ^^^I ^^^live ^^^in ^^^Britain ^^^but ^^^I ^^^can ^^^still ^^^be ^^^happy ^^^for ^^^the ^^^Americans
$C: This is not an issue. When Net Neutrality was taken away everyone went crazy and nothing happened. We do not need it back. Let the free market work like it always has.
$C: Whos 'we'! Not me!! Net neutrality is a bad thing from what I hear! 
$C: Those of us with functioning brains realize that Net Neutrality is a clear violation of Free speech. It will therefore be shot down if not by the House, then by our terrific president himself, and i thank God for that\(and for him\).
$C: Suck on that, Ajit.
$C: As a Canadian I have to ask. How do all these net neutrality posts generally have less upvotes than a picture of a cute cat licking a cute dog in the sun? Especially when ironically that apparently life altering photo would be less accessible without...what? You guessed it! Lmfao. People are surprising.
$C: Congratulations! You've now charged the government with expanding to rural areas. Big government and high taxes with no incentive to gain efficiency is always a great answer.  Be proud come tax time my friends.
$C: Can I be honest here for a sec? I don’t give a fuck that net neutrality is coming back. I have not noticed a single difference since it went away. I just think that liberals are just freaking out about nothing. 
$C: Get rekt, A-shit pie
$C: Why is this good? Doesn't this mean that the government will be able to dictate to companies how much bandwidth each website will be given and remove the options from the companies providing internet service?

Net neutrality sound like a fair term.  But I'm not convinced it is.  

It sounds like the government will require, under penalty of law, an internet provider like Verizon give and equal amount of bandwidth to YouTube with millions of users, and obscurewebsite.com with 10 users.  Won't this just leave a bunch of bandwidth unused and make the YouTube videos significantly slower to stream and watch?

Someone please explain to me if this assessment is wrong.
$C: [deleted]
$C: FUCK YES 😆😆😆! Honestly feels like a great victory to fuck Ajit over 😈. Great job everyone 😀😄😎😊 .
$C: We didn't have Net Neutrality until 2015. Yet apparently it's this super important thing that's vital to the internet. Yeah, I'm calling bullshit.
$C: Fucking really? We did it reddit? What about all the trump voters on reddit who made repeal of net neutrality possible? What a fucking joke. Get out of here with this crap. Left leaning progressives did this, not reddit. 
$C: Thanos been defeated 
$C: Ok nerds
$C: It’ll get vetoed, because of freedom! The government isn’t your friend. The problems you are complaining about are from the bs regulations currently in place. Break up the monopolies is what you should be screaming. Go with peace my brothers
$C: We won't I am tired of this shit I emailed and registered mailed my senator 5 times over the past few years and I have been against the thousands who don't give a fuck...as of now I have entered the don't give a fuck network I can only beat my head against a wall so many times until the wall wins, and the wall won (if they try again in which they will) you can try to do the same thing X amount of times before it becomes insanity and this is what they are counting on. The freedom of America is governed by AT $T, Comast, Verizon. Hail corporate for freedom


$C: Net Neutrality is a bad thing

Also its not going to pass through the house
$C: YEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
$C: Hopefully, Mr. Trump's ~~fuck~~buddy will not suade him to veto it.
$C: Dear admin, 

You allow /r/the_donald to exist thus furthering filthy republicans in their spot in power. 

You should be ashamed at letting these people fester in our communities. 

You have a helping in allowing these corporations attain the power they have achieved. 

If you're with the people, you will remove /r/the_donald from your site. 

Otherwise, your words are pointless. 
$C: Guess you should've had a bigger novelty mug AShit Pai!
$C: Why do you post these posts so late at night?
$C: So I’ve had this debate over Net neutrality with another friend.  He claimed that it would be a good thing that would encourage competition with other ISP’s for our benefit.  

Obviously there was a long discussion on the topic.  But my question is this...can I get a very non-biased explanation of the pros/cons of having or not having net neutrality?  
$C: We didn’t win shit.......  it’s election year theater 
$C: Suck our collective cocks Ajit Pai.
$C: We're not gonna win over 20 representatives and Trump sure as fuck is not gonna sign it. Just wait until 2020

I just hope subreddits dont spam this issue like the first time. It was annoying and I had to filter out the words "net neutrality" from my feed
$C: I am the House.
$C: Congratulations USA, you've regained some respect from the world with this. Please keep up the fight for this.

Sincerely a broke ass Scotsman.   
$C: As a conservative republican I will cross the line and vote out my party for strong NN protections.  Screw the majority of Republicans I'm sick of their shit.
$C: It'll be really interesting to see how this goes to a MAJORITY REPUBLICAN house, and A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT....GL kids, Entire waste of time.
$C: More Government! More control! We did it reddit!!!! /r/circlejerk 
$C: Face the music, Reddit. The restoration will die in the House, Republicans have an even bigger majority there, and even IF if got passed, it'd be vetoed. 
$C: See, now guys, we gotta follow through and vote out every single one of the 47 who opposed this. We want to really make a point that the only bipartisan issue that everyone from /r/the_Brendan , /r/guro , /r/engineeringporn , and all of /r/all can agree on is that you do NOT fuck with the Internet, and the best way to make that clear is make sure that these 47 out-of-touch shills never see a seat again.

E; Fixed a political snafu 
$C: Marxism is alive and kicking in the liberal Senate. We need net neutrality to be eliminated so that we can address the presence of Muslims secretly subverting Ametica over its own bandwidth. And to keep it superior by pricing the trash off of it.
$C: House won’t vote for it and I’ll laugh.
$C: Idiots... You just love government control... God you people are so dumb. Begging to be slaves. Absolutely pathetic. #no-report-pls #just-being-honest
$C: We.....did it Reddit?!

#WE FUCKING DID IT
$C: Lol, this is never going to make it though the White House.

Having the government regulate the internet is ass backwards anyway. I rather get ass blasted by fees then jailed for making the "wrong" Facebook post.
$C: Hi!! Mexican here. Why is Europe so fucked?
$C: This sucks, I wish I could downvote this completely.  This measure should fail, net neutrality is terrible for the US and businesses.
$C: And yet you still allow /r/the_Donald to exist
$C: since we're on a win streak how about banning r/the_donald
$C: Great. More government intervention. Next stop communism. 
$C: Fuck net neutrality. Stop censoring free speech.
$C: While the Admins fight to save Net Neutrality, remember that Reddit gives aid and comfort to those that celebrate the destruction of internet freedom to appease their precious daddy. Even in the face of obscene bigotry, calls to violence, doxxing innocent people, Reddit continues to let them get away with it. I am in favor of freedom of speech but Reddit is a private company and they can institute stricter moderation to prevent their radicalization that already took at least one life (in Mount Vernon, WA) but are too cheap and/or lazy and/or complicit to do so.
$C: We haven't won until Pai is behind fucking bars. 
$C: The amount of false information regarding net neutrality is astounding, and I am sure the people supporting it would also say Snowden was a hero. Lmfao the irony 
$C: That sucks
$C: I remember going to get a government phone when they had control over the telephone systems. Until unregulated, you could have a wall phone or a desk phone of 3 colors.  Then they deregulated it. Now we have cell phones. Hope the government can get better control of the internet. Too much fake information now.  It needs controlled. 
$C: Why was it banned? Who was it hurting?

I had extensive "gay conversion" therapy and without the joyous gift of God, I wouldn't be 10 years married with 5 beautiful children. 

It's an amazing thing, what my therapy sessions taught me. Without them, my life would've been full of sin. God helped me see what my duty was. I'd be lost without these sessions.

I encourage sinful gays to go out of your state in search of these therapy sessions. Ask your local church, trust me. God loves us all, some of us just require a little bit of help. 

God bless
$C: President Trump will veto this. Thankfully.

$C: We? It's not a foregone conclusion that everyone supports NN. Alienating people you disagree with wont keep working out so well.

KEK WILLS IT
$C: Now we can continue to watch cat videos.
$C: Im just gonna go ahead and link [this Steven Crowder video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G35g5HQVjpU) that does a really good job of explaining as to why it is that so many people like myself are opposed to Net Neutrality. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: The house and this president will stop the government takeover of the Internet. Liberals are breaking something that isn’t broken like usual.
$C: Hooray. Now our internet gets to be controlled by the politicians! How has government run speech ever gone wrong
$C: "We?" I didn't know we had so many Google and Facebook employees on Reddit. Explains a lot.

The consumer didn't win today. What the ISPs wanted to do was charge Silicon Valley for using up most of their bandwidth. They can not, so now they charge the consumer more to make up for the inability to offset bandwidth costs. **Net neutrality pushes the cost of bandwidth away from hundred billion dollar corporations in Silicon Valley and passes the cost onto the consumer.** And everybody is cheering like this is a victory.

The consumer benefits from a balance of power so that neither ISP nor Silicon Valley can control the internet. Net Neutrality ensures that Silicon Valley controls the internet, meaning they will effectively do, and have already been further deciding, what you are and are not allowed to see and watch and speak on because they are protected by the government. There is no room for the little guy, hence why Twitter, Amazon, Netflix, Youtube, and Facebook do not have any sizable competition. This solidifies their strength and means a less open internet. Net neutrality does absolutely nothing to fix the issues about the lack of competition in service providers, it only serves to protect Silicon Valley.

And the silly thing is, ISPs are still going to overcharge you if you want their service, they just have to be less explicit about why they're overcharging you now. 

No one here found it a bit odd that the ones in complete power fought the hardest to preserve "Net Neutrality" because no one questioned their motives? It wasn't one of virtuous intent, it was of greed. But everyone here played their part in strengthening the Silicon Valley Oligopoly.

This post doesn't stand a chance of surviving the onslaught of downvotes because it is wrongthink to question Net Neutrality. But let it be heard the very thing people have been in fear of (corporations controlling the internet) is the very thing proponents of Net Neutrality have accepted because it came from the fear mongers that got them to be their army. Viva Le Bezos. Zucc Heil. 
$C: You know, Susan Collins is all right sometimes.
$C: Thank god. I know it's going to be a rough road moving forward, but it's nice to know there *will* be a forward for open and free internet. WE CAN DO THIS!
$C: This is lamest thing to argue about
$C: we didn't do shit, the senators who voted have had their minds made up this entire time. the only people who did anything were the three dissenting republican votes.
$C: If the house, who has a ton of republicans, doesn’t shoot it down then trump will most likely veto it. One can dream though
$C: We did it guys, great job!  Keep on spamming!
$C: I know we’re not finished, but this is a super exiting step in the right direction. Keep calling and writing in guys, we can do it!
$C: Maybe common sense isn’t entirely dead after all
$C: I have upvoted this post in approval. We did it reddit.com! 
$C: Holy shit, that was a close vote. 

I'm gonna be really interested in knowing the backroom deals that occurred to get that vote.
$C: We won one battle in this war. Pressure needs to increase. Politicians need to be put on notice - a vote against net neutrality is a vote against their re-election.

$C: The house and the president WILL shoot this down
$C: Thank God, now my internet will start working again!
$C: Could Reddit shutter itself just before the vote and can you work with other companies to have them do the same thing? That in itself is a powerful message and if a small percentage of the millions of people that visit here write, email, or call could tip the balance and help us win this fight for good.
$C: Boo
$C: How was it that close? Who thought repealing it was a good idea other than Pai and the other 2 FCC people that voted to repeal?
$C: This wasn’t gonna affect me either way
$C: That's neat and all but Reddit is unscrupulous as fuck ... Them celebrating this scares the shit outta me.  NO offense well maybe a ^little ^^^fuckspez
$C: WoooHooo! One less nail in the coffin! [Now FIGHT!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeOTVOF8tUo)
$C: This affects everyone. Kinda sad America gets the last say.
$C: GREAT news for a change, but I don't think we have heard the last of Net Neutrality or Agit Pai.
$C: I am not even an American and I don't know why this makes me freaking happy but fuck yeah!
$C: Unlucky
$C: No one reads anymore, I watched cspan this afternoon, the 52-47 vote was whether or not they were going to just debate the topic of restoring the Obama era net neutrality rules. 

The vote to restore or deny is tonight in less than an hour, still send stuff to your reps never the less!
$C: The House isn't going to vote in favor of net neutrality. And even if it does it needs to go to the White House. 

It was a good run boys.
$C: what is this about????

can i have some info about this

is it about DOGE!!!!!
$C: We won nothing, stop self-congratulating yourselves.

The House has to pass it, and Trump is probably going to veto it for some bullshit reason.
$C: Alright Senators, don't you fucking make this mistake again. Your heads will be on a fucking spike.
$C: Pointless waste of time. It'll either be killed in the house or by the president
$C: Thank goodness. Living over seas in limited in how I can participate. I was getting ready for the net riots of 2018.
$C: Soooooo loving this! #resist #unitedredditresists #timesup
$C: I needed some good news today. Good work ya'll, keep fighting the good fight There is nothing more powerful than people uniting for the common good. 
$C: I just hope Net Neutrality keeps on living! Without it, I would have to pay to go on reddit! :\(
$C: Free porn with da boiiis!
$C: I really think you don’t grasp Presidential Veto power or what it takes to get a super majority in a Rep. Controlled house and Senate. But yeahhhh for votes that don’t matter at all. 
$C: No we haven’t. Still has to go through the House.

Do you even understand the American political process?
$C: L
$C: We \*

\*except for /u/spez who still supports T_D's policies including his pick of FCC chair. 
$C: It’s a shame we put more effort into this then healthcare reform and minimum wage increase. Imagine what could be done if we all worked together on other large scale issues.
$C: This is phenomenal news except that from this information alone, we can surmise that there are, at most, 52 senators who are both competent and non-evil. How many of those 52 do you think actually are both? Get some cross-referencing up in here.
$C: This won't even make it to Trumps desk to sign.

Not that he would anyway.

NN is a joke just like Reddit 
$C: If private sites like Reddit and Twitter have the power to restrict access to content that people want to view, then so should private ISPs.
$C: Yup nothing like government regulation to stifle innovation 
$C: NOT YET.
$C: Don't say we won. Don't get complacent. It ain't over yet.
$C: damn america's law system and such is complicated
$C: Trump ain’t signing the bill idiots
$C: How unfortunate. At least The House will likely never pass it.
$C: YEAH THOM TILLIS CAN SUCK MY VEINY DICK
$C: Speak for yourself, totalitarian goon.
$C: I AM the Senate!
$C: As someone who leans right on several issues, and understand the argument against NN in principle, this makes me happy.
$C: This meme is dead.
$C: From a technical perspective, net neutrality isn't desirable. The infrastructure of the net was built upon non-neutrality.
$C: Idiots.  The Net Neutrality regulations were FAR too vague.  Getting rid of this horseshit and replacing it with common-sense, targeted regulations is the win We the American People desparately need.  Screw this "explain in to me" bullshit; have any if you actually read and understood the text of the Net Neutrality regulation?
$C: Hooray. Now we can all still continue to pay high prices for awful internet speeds
$C: Boooo
$C: Apes together strong
$C: Hey sorry for being ignorant and I'm 100% for net neutrality, no questions. What changes have Americans seen since the FCC took away net neutrality? 
$C: Watch who votes against it ( against you ) and for it in the house.

Vote accordingly in November
$C: Fuck you Ashit Pai, I hope you lose your job.
$C: Thank god there won't be these posts anymore then
$C: Looking forward for the whining and spamming to pick back up around the time the House shoots it down.
$C: what happens to ajit pai if house votes for net neutrality as well? Surely that would be clear proof that his ideas are against what the people want... will he be replaced?
$C: Yeaah!, nice one guys!. Keep pushing forward this corporate greedy asshats, I wish the best luck from the Caribbean!
$C: ya!  now what.
$C: Yay
$C: Fuck yes! I can't believe it! Can we celebrate yet? or will they just rename the bill and try again tomorrow?  Or maybe they realised that states having their own Net Neutrality was harder for them defeat and easier to keep it controlled by the government. I bet all 47 were fucking Republicans. Thanks to the 3 Republicans that aren't shit! 
$C: I bet the admins are really happy about this. Now the vote goes to the house, which means another round of astrotufing which means another round of getting paid to promote things on your website. 
$C: Ah.. I see Roy Blunt, is still making Missouri not great again.
$C: Yippee!
$C: wooooohooooooooo
$C: bullshit. it did happen without my phone call, email, or other activism. I'm one lazy ass cunt, and it got restored with me just playin dota 2, and not talkin bout that shit at all.
$C: This is amazing.
$C: Yes we are eternally victorious 
$C: HAHA FUCK YOU AJIT
$C: Good, now nobody can pretty much just make every web\-page cost a subscription fee for competing companies and the likes. \(I.E. Frontier doesn't like Apple, so going to their web\-page would be a separate fee, etc.\) All very feasible when Net Neutrality is gone.
$C: Without a veto proof majority Trump is going to shit all over this.
$C: YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!

$C: About time! Take the kahjiit pat!
$C: So does that mean trump can/will mess it up?
$C: We Did It Reddit!, indeed!
$C: Good Job Everyone!

i didn't do anything..
$C: Trump will veto it once it gets to his desk. 
$C: Doesn’t matter to me I live in Washington and we are the first state to outlaw it. Even if it happens it can’t happen here. 
$C: if it makes it through the house (it probably wont) our shit head president will shoot it down guaranteed.
$C: There's still hope😌
$C: I did it I did it.... okay we did it! 
$C: This is the one thing that can unite everyone. The right to keep the place where we argue pointlessly.
$C: Help me understand why the Republicans are opposed to net neutrality? Is this big business funding their election campaigns? What’s in it for them?
$C: usa good israel no us idk what u talk about dont hate us world
$C: Best to think of this as 1/3 of a victory.
$C: Of course - my Senators from Arkansas wrote everyone off and voted against the restoration of Net Neutrality.
$C: Yeet 
$C: Thanks!
$C: Long Live Free Speach!!
$C: It is so good what you guys are doing over in America, Australia has the same issue right meow I hope you win the battle and set a good example for Australia to follow and congratulation to everyone who has helped out your efforts aren't for nothing
$C: Thank you Alphabet, Elon Musk, Apple, Michael Dell and probably Oprah and Buffet as well!!!!!!!!!!!
$C: Isn't this reversal just a feint so that they can inject even stronger, more ambiguous language making future attempts to protect it easier to dismantle, or something like that? (out of the loop)
$C: Ah hell ya
$C: I run a small online business, my Texas congressman has stated publicly that he is for a repeal of NN. Can I get a prompt of what so say when I call his office to let him know I am for NN? Thank you so much in advance!
$C: Are senators really listening? Only like 3 republicans voted in favor. The rest of those outdated dirt bags didnt listen for shit. Vote them out
$C: Thank mankind and sheer luck and the winds that blew in Net Neutralities favour!! :') This win makes me feel so warm inside!
$C: FUCK YES, I DONT EVEN LIVE IN AMERICA AND IM FUCKING PUMPED!!!
$C: I have now really come to realize republicans are sacs of fucking shit. 
$C: wE dId It ReDdIt
$C: Fuck yeah
$C: >:3 suck it, Ajit Pai
$C: Arabscarab is a cool name
$C: im suprised that fucker isn't dead yet. 
$C: 68000th upvote!!!

And yay net neutrality! Heck, I'm gonna use emojis because this is a special occasion!
😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
$C: How does this effect us in different companies but are using common u.s. based sites ?
$C: Thank you, Lisa. 
$C: Both of my senators voted against...well I know who I'm not voting for!
$C: I have a lot more faith in the Senate to do the right thing than I do the house of representatives.. But this is a nice first step. We'll see if common sense prevails or not. Can't give up either way.
$C: This is the way it should have been done in the first place, as a law, not a regulation.   Question is, is the FCC still in charge of it?  I hope not.  The last thing we need is the same agency that regulates what you can say on broadcast tv and radio trying to jump into doing that on the Internet, just because they’re “in charge”.

Laws, not bureaucrats.
$C: I feel this will pass the house but I highly expect Trump to kill it.  He is to stupid to care.
$C: Hecc yea
$C: yay
$C: # in the senate

Yeah, it has a long way to go. I super super want net neutrality, but if it costs Republicans the election in November, that would be fantastic.  Then we can pass strong net neutrality laws.
$C: ~~~~
$C: Holy fucking snicker doodles in a bowl of KitKat ice cream with maple syrup and hot chocolate 
$C: I am the senate
$C: I am the Senate.
$C: I'm a 12-year old male bisexual child living in Lapeer, Michigan, USA, and don't think net neutrality should exist. People spend money to create media and software, so we shouldn't take it from them for free
$C: There is strength in numbers, let's keep it up redditors !!
$C: Saved
$C: Fuck yes! Those that voted yes are probably trying to stay in office, but the outcome is great. I hope it pans out.
$C: Now for the House of Representatives.
$C: I emailed both inhofe and lankford here in oklahoma and can confirm from their long ass responses. They have no idea how the internet words. Of course they voted against. Douche nozzles
$C: Celebrating this as a win is very odd. There's no way it passes the house and if it does trump will veto it. Unfortunately, net neutrality is as unprotected as it was yesterday and is likely to remain so until we start electing democrats and take back the house. 
$C: Senator Palpatine will pay.
$C: it shouldn't have been this close
$C: [Hey guys, before you get too excited remember](https://youtu.be/FFroMQlKiag?t=14s)
$C: Holy shit thank you Reddit 
$C: We *are* the Senate!
$C: A thanks to my senator Susan Collins for being one of only 3 republicans to vote for the bill.  This is something Maine wants and you are doing us a solid.

I'm still pissed at you for the tax bill vote though. Like WTF?
$C: Press (F) to F&%K ajit pai.
$C: God, the next set of democrats in office with a majority need to force the FCC to classify the internet as a utility. This bullshit needs to stop and it’s a giant waste of resources.

Just like when the govt asked big telecom to create a nation wide fiber network and instead pocketed $400 BILLION in taxpayer dollars without building anything.
$C: I don’t understand how it was that close.  Who are the 47?  We need to have a talk 47....  your going to be on time out for being a bad human 
$C: Will this bill prevent Ajit Pai and the FCC from simply re-doing their decision? Will this be another law they can choose to ignore?
$C: Fuck. Well there goes our chance at internet freedom. 

$C: Wow this is awesome. I was really doubting it to happen, but we made it possible.! Glad to finally hear some positive news about Net Neutrality just as people were giving up hope.
$C: You know the house and Senate will approve this, no worries there. #MAGA (not giving credit to Trump for this win just saying he is for the people)
$C: No thanks to Johnny Isakson and David Perdue of Georgia. I called them first thing this morning and managed to get though to both of their lines. Of course it didn't matter. They'll need to be voted out at the first opportunity.
$C: 1987 the fairness doctrine was done away with.  Look at what it's caused.  Net neutrality is even bigger than that.  There is no way back once it's ridden of.  I HATR ALL CAPS BIT WE NEED TO STAND THE FUCK UP.
$C: There are 47 people that ought to have their careers ended.
$C: Bullet dodged. Good job Americans
$C: The fact that it was still so close shows just how little the elected officials care about actually representing the people. Big surprise right?
$C: It's kind of funny to see the man who tried to destroy the American internet as we know it look so defeated right there. I wouldn't be surprised if in protest he resigns his position. However the fight is not yet over. While the Senate has agreed 2 restore or rather keep net neutrality we still have to worry about the White House itself. As we've seen Trump is not afraid to use presidential orders to get what he wants. If he is in support of Ajit Pai then we very well may still have a long road ahead of us.
$C: A great victory, yet war isn't over! I'm outside the us yet the risk of spillovers is incredibly high therefore we must stand as one
$C: This is fucking Hilarious that you still think Reddit and their phone calls won this vote. But hey, whatever makes you happy!
$C: Congratulations to lobbyists of Big Tech. If this goes through, they won’t have to pay a dime for infrastructure that is a backbone of their business. 

But it seems that in the House lobbyists of ISPs will win, meaning they can offload costs of their basic business on tech companies.

Good luck, America. You’re fucked either way. 
$C: wow we did it reddit give yourselves a big pat on the back you guys are the PINNACLE of freedom for the modern age, truly!!!
$C: Screw you ajit pai. You just wasted yourself. This is what you get for being a greedy sell-out. I want the FBI to find more details on the bribery behind all this. This will affect your children's future in a negative way when they finally grow up and understand what their father has done. You have to go out in public after this, think about it... Wanna degrade your own life for money?
$C: Haha.  So big corporate internet companies like reddit are for this.  

That's all you need to know.
$C: Fuck yes, way to go internet, I did my part but my senator was wearing his asshat unfortunately.
$C: Audibly just said *no Fucking way* I think I speak for anyone and everyone who values their internet freedom when I say I really hope this gets passed in our favor.
$C: Nobody cares
$C: finally you yanks can shut the fuck up about this
$C: We?
$C: Yeah. You sheeple go on and celebrate a government regulated internet.

Just kidding! Great outcome but still a long way to go. 
$C: I'd rather not give control of the internet to the government but I read 1984, so what do I know 
$C: The internet has been just fine without government, net neutrality is governments foot in the door to taxation.
$C: YEAH SUCK IT AJIT
$C: YAY STAH WAHS!
$C: Good. Now maybe we can fucking not get these "OMG GUYS! THIS IS IT! THIS time it's REALLY happening! THIS time it's our LAST chance to save net neutrality! For super reals this time!" every god damn fucking week like some fucking boy who cried wolf on fucking speed.

$C: Why would you celebrate the continued stunting of the growth of the US Internet infrastructure?
$C: LoL its was the pressure from companies like google and Microsoft that made this possible. Its not about people think but about what money can do
$C: Does that mean you will stop spamming me now?
$C: Non-Us, just curious: so you're telling me, that this bill will still have to be signed by the orange-in-chief? 🤐
$C: I honestly don’t understand any of this. I thought we already lost this vote? 
$C: # WE DID IT REDDIT XDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

👏👏👏 REDDIT ALWAYS GET WHAT REDDIT WANTS :\^) 👏👏👏
$C: Holy shit guys! Congrats, keep up the good work. As an European and Portuguese, I'm rooting for you. You guys have been through a shit show these past 16 months.
Hope you fix your country and get those clowns out of your government.
$C: I DID NOTHING AND EVERYTHING TURNED OUT OKAY!
$C: Is it just me, or does the use of the term “net neutrality” leave you confused as to which is good or bad?
$C: I understand this is a great victory, but as I’m from Canada could anyone explain exactly what this means?
$C: Ayy lmao
$C: I am not going to say I am sad. 
But I was hoping for you guys to have your internet blocked so I could go on r/The_Donald and post some Bernie Sanders pictures because you know mods over there would be too cheap to buy Reddit packet from their internet providers. 
But then again... There would be noone to upvote it anyway
$C: Upvote this please, we celebrate tonight!
$C: Eat my shit, Ajit
$C: The day shitposting saved the internet. 
$C: Internet existed before net neutrality and was fine. All ending it would do is make the internet a free market and if someone did drive up prices, people wouldn’t buy from them anymore.
$C: Who's "We"?
$C: This means less than it's hyped to. At least that's how it seems to me. There's a bit of a difference between blocking a measure by the FCC and removing the authority from them altogether.

For instance, this probably isn't the start of new legislation. That would have started in the House and not the Senate. Really, all they seem to be doing is monkey patching a flawed implementation rather than fixing the situation.

Better than nothing, but not something that will last.
$C: I'm not American but I think if net neutrality disappear in the USA it'll do the same in the rest of the world sooner or later so I'm really thankfull to you guys for your effort in restoring it.
Have a nice day and thanks again.
$C: I'll never forget how [this asshole](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/14/the-fccs-ajit-pai-dressed-up-as-santa-and-wielded-a-light-saber-to-mock-net-neutrality-rules/?utm_term=.4ac0692b7c27) treated Net Neutrality.
$C: So in other words you unequivocally openly support the regulation of the internet by the government? It's unanimous that we shouldn't allow those who pay extra for faster band speed? This will indeed stifle and discourage innovation for the internet and infastruture because it will eliminate incentives and curb competition. Yeah smart business move.
$C: I don't think 52-47 is something to be all that happy about. It's not a landslide. You say you've "got a long way to go", but personally I think it's hopeless. You can keep fighting the good fight, but I think you've already lost.
$C: While this is a victory, I have this feeling that the republicans in the senate just voted for what their party’s president wants with no real understanding of what banning net neutrality means (probably because senators of typical age barely use the internet). If net neutrality was better explained to them, maybe this wouldn’t be a partisan issue in the senate because it’s certainly not a partisan issue with the public, as a majority of all Americans want net neutrality regardless of politics.
$C: You mean you won the vote to destroy American internet in the Senate, but hopefully the house will rip the bill to shreds.
$C: "We" communists pfftttt
$C: This is terrible news.  One step closer to a restrictive, laggy, censored internet.
$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3idWUf3CVi4
$C: This NN bill is so complex, it doesn't help startups or small businesses one bit. If they re-wrote the bill and simplified it, the bill would become the laws that are already in place.

I also think an internet company startup, specifically for low latency gaming, should be able to ban types of data that slow their network. With NN, they can't.
$C: So this is how liberty dies . . . with thunderous applause

$C: Veto that shit
$C: Repealing net neutrality actually could have solved a lot of problems on the internet but people didn't understand what was actually happening it helps that everyone was freaking out that ajit pai was going to make us pay extra for everything which was a huge exaggeration 
$C: Net Neutrality is a big corp incentive - we need an internet bill of rights for the people not a bill for politicians, Big Social and big corporations. Please do yourself a favor and stop reading MSM and open your mind and stop being a sheep.
$C: WASTE OF TIME!!! Net Neutrality is useless and is bad for progress
$C: Two things. First of all do you know why there are so few options for internet? Like why does ATT have exclusive access to my area? Second of all Net Neutrality does not regulate the prices ISPs can charge. It guarantees an ISP can not discriminate between different packets of data. That has nothing to do with overall internet prices.  
$C: Vetoed by GEOTUS, who once again saves the people

$C: Why is this such a big deal? It honestly sounds like liberal bullshit.
$C: Hopefully Trump knocks it down.
$C: YEEEEEEEEEEET
$C: Suck it, Pai!
$C: My Noble friends Ajit Pai has fallen we have won the battle! But we still have the most deadly foe the house! Call your representatives because for tonight... We ride! 
$C: You guys do realize Net Neutrality was only conceived ten years ago?  And that everything was fine before that?
$C: Net neutrality is not a good thing.  

https://youtu.be/hKD-lBrZ_Gg
$C: House Republicans have already said they aren’t going to even vote on it so this isn’t over. The real votes count in November!!! 
$C: Thank you Senate Republicans for making it happen
$C: ' restore Net Neutrality' has it something to do with favoring hillary and leftists?
$C: Can we please stop this bullshit thread? Reddit's Admins could give a shit about Net Neutrality. They've shown that they will bend their knee whenever an encroachment of First Amendment liberties are passed. Reddit Admins are only interested in ad revenue, not those who are fighting for Net Neutrality. Let's stop pretending like Reddit isn't a massive corporation designed to siphon every ad dollar out of its user and instead recognize that this website is only interested in gaining as much money as possible under the current laws.
$C: You are aware that net neutrality in america is a red herring meant to distract us and anyone who actually buys into it is a dumbass right? Seriously... The whole point of a free market is to render rules such as net neutrality redundant and unnecessary...
Then again... 
If you still believe that government will ever solve an issue itself you're still part of the problem. 
$C: it's irrelevant, Daddy Trump will make sure the internet is made free again. I don't know why the admins are endorsing communism (it's never worked whenever it's been tried) but thankfully the American people know better.
$C: AJIT PAI RESIGNED😂👌
$C: I lost. You don’t speak for everyone, but you insist. 
$C: Wanna take credit for the Sun rising also, Reddit?

I mean after all, without YOU it wouldn't happen!
$C: [deleted]
$C: Your senators hear you because they’re commies too. They’d have done it without you.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I respectfully disagree with Net Neutrality. In all intents and purposes, it is internet communism. If I run a business, I would want a fast internet connection to run it, instead of the government throttling my speed. If my Internet service is too slow, I will gladly switch to a different ISP. That is how capitalism works.
$C: Yeet
$C: Who's *we*?
$C: Meh
$C: Enjoy your false victory. 
$C: Or lost, depending what option u were looking for, unless by "we" you meant brain dead repeat what ever we read redditors, then grats!
$C: Thank you cool, Very Kanye!
$C: L
$C: No one has been able to explain why this is important. I know reddit is full of down voters and know it alls but really why should I care. 
$C: Boo
$C: Yay! We just a little closer to giving control of our internets to the government. Drink beer! Get your heads out of the sand people. 
$C: Trump will never sign it.  Can't wait to see this in r/prematurecelebration
$C: > The evidence is clear that Net Neutrality is important to Americans of both parties (or no party at all)

Yea, but people only care for 72 hours every 3 months, because they're told to. The slacktivist attitudes of people will make it so this happens again and again.

So upvote the thread, comment acting like you did something, then go back to your normal posting. Meanwhile the issue still exists because no one is willing to see it through past 1 week.


$C: Thanks to the inbred rednecks who vote red this won't matter.  The Dumbass is a corporate shill and the house is full of sad old people who worship his crusty penis. 
$C: Ugh I thought we killed that thing.
$C: Ugh I thought we killed that thing.
$C: Has anyone noticed anything different since net neutrality was repealed, everybody was overreacting.
$C: Net neutrality is a terrible idea and it did pretty much nothing
$C: I didn’t see a difference when we had and didn’t have it. Just what we need....more government in our business 
$C: Was anti-NN, but oh well. People honestly need to look at both sides of issues. There are good arguments both for and against NN.
$C: We did it, Reddit! I can’t wait to celebrate with my wife and her boyfriend and son. We’re gonna go see black panther for the 4th time!!! :DDDD
$C: Go fuck yourself reddit for clearly being politically bias, not all of us want net neutrality 
$C: A tragedy for freedom. 
$C: Has anything negative come from reversing net neutrality to date. I heard so much leading up to it, then nothing about the fallout.
$C: Hurray for government control of the internet! That could never lead to anything like censorship or anything like that ever! 
$C: Net Neutrality is not a good thing. Why should I subsidize Your Netflix addiction.. grow up and take responsibility for yourselves. All it would've taken is for these these three Republicans to vote for their principles. Ffs. Another subtraction of freedom. Another restraint on an otherwise free market. But none of You care to understand. Y'all are fooled by the double-speak. You vote Your rights away gladly. And I'll be downvoted because I'm telling the truth.
$C: ARE YOU GUYS HIGH AF!!!?

/VETO!!!!

MAGA!!!!!!!!
$C: Ajit pai is a good man and i hope he got a new cool mug
$C: Good luck in the House, retards. 
$C: [removed]
$C: Isn’t this a case of the government sticking. It’s nose where it doesn’t belong? If an ISP wants to throttle speeds to a website, or charge more for better service, isn’t that its right? The invisible hand of the free market would surely correct this.  
$C: Time for absolutely nothing to change again, just like when it was repealed. 
$C: Again with this shit. 
$C: Yaaaay! Government control of the internet! Because they do everything else so good.
$C: Lame. So tired of this populist garbage. Hopefully Trump will have the good sense to use his veto but I'm not holding my breath on that one.
$C: Bruh. Net neutrality is bad for everyone. 
$C: "White Power" sign? The fucking "ok" sign is racist now?
$C: Wow this is absolutely amazing. I wonder how much the major websites blacking or Redding our their sites made a massive impact? Regardless now I won’t have to pay my ISP to watch porn!
$C: Well that's a bummer.
$C: america doesnt own the internet.
$C: Yaaaay for Big(ger) Government!
$C: God I hate Reddit
$C: I don't understand why people want corporations to be allowed the ability to control the internet.  That's what "Net Neutrality" has the potential to deliver.

"Those who would give up essential liberty, to purchase temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety."  -Benjamin Franklin

Yes.  We know the context of the quote was addressing a governor who had been bought, similar to the Democratic vote.  Yet it appears BF was wise beyond imagining and those words echo true in many cases they were unintended for.

You made your bed.  Prepare to lie and possibly die in it.
$C: Net Neutrality is an awful idea that allows a nation state to influence the internet. Internet companies need to be free of state regulation so that they do not monopolize further. This will lead to further monopolization and power for the largest firms as they have money to lobby the state for more controls. This will reduce the quantity of new and cheaper isps in the future, and will increase the cost of internet as a whole. 

FUCK NET NEUTRALITY
$C: Why is reddit so fascinated with encouraging government oversight and regulation of the internet? Don’t that know “net neutrality” is just another power grab by the feds?
$C: I'm gonna get destroyed saying this. But democrats ran the country into a hole the last 8 years, why are we gonna trust the majority of them to control the internet?
$C: Net neutrality is a scam. How about car neutrality? everyone gets a Porsche for the same price as a Yugo? How about house neutrality? everyone gets a house on the ocean for the same price as a shack in the Ozarks? In this world you get what you pay for, get over it, move on with your life and stop trying to live off of others. Remember I trade my LIFE, for money. I work hours, my life, get paid funds. You with net neutrality are trying to steal the only thing of value I have MY LIFE.
$C: Was this posted by Google directly? Damn, FUCK NET NEUTRALITY!!!!!!!  

MILLENNIALS don't listen to this bullshit! It's all an attempt at an oligopoly for the big tech firms. FUCK THEM. 

They are selling you byte by fucking byte to 3rd parties and your respective governments.

$C: good now go fuck yourself with a stick
$C: This is awful. Anyone supporting this hasn't read the thing.
$C: Why did you post a picture of the A-hole with light shining on the top like he's an angel or something? He did not win this for us? And when is he getting jailed for meeting AT&T privately through the Cohen guy?
$C: Okay so liberal Democrats are for it? Then I am against it! You want others to give you and others their time money or property every damn time. It's not "neutrality" it's big government running stuff. Big government did not make the internet what it is today. Individuals and yes money hungry corporations did. Wanna see what the government does, go look at the gas can. Yeah I said a simple two gallon gas can. They were $3 and you opened the top and poured the gas. Government got involved! They said hey the fumes can escape! Got to fix that! We now have gas cans that have a special nozzle, they DO NOT WORK
 THE FUMES GET OUT ANYWAY NO MATTER WHAT. EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION WILL ALWAYS LET THE FUMES OUT. PLUS THEY SPILL, LEAK BREAK AND CATCH WATER THAT ENDS UP IN THE FUEL TANK!

If you want to ruin the internet let the government control it. 

Scariest words in the world...HI IM FROM THE GOVERNMENT, IM HERE TO HELP.
YOU CAN TRUST THEM...JUST
ASK THE AMERICAN INDIANS.
$C: Holy fuck just shut the fuck up about this issue, go the fuck outside and live life

Net neutrality is good but holy shit I dont even look at r/all anymore because of the constant whining about either this or some fake news bashing Trump

Fuck sakes Reddit is so cancerous, only here for Ice's sub
$C: Net neutrality is not important, yet Reddit is obsessed with it.  Just the sheep being led around by their Sheppard
$C: Lolling heartily at all of the people who don’t understand how the government works.

This is just virtue signaling and preemptive vote defense for Senators in purpley states.

Not only will this die on the floor of the House; it never had a chance of being signed into law by POTUS.
$C: The government has more power of your internet, and you're celebrating. How embarrassing.
$C: No chance this regulation is recertified, Trump will veto. Amazing how many people are fighting for more government 
$C: Be wary when Democrats want something this bad.
$C: A lot of fake Libertarians out here. All of a sudden when push comes to shove about deregulations they run back to Daddy government. I thought people believe in competition... Guess not. You dear at regulations by cable companies so you want regulation by the government. Sounds dumb. 
$C: Can't wait til Net Neutrality is finally gone (hopefully) now keep this shit out of my feed. Thanks, Reddit.
$C: We won = the large corporations funding a massive propoganda campaign to regulate the internet to their benefit. Good job Reddit, way to fight to be less free. 
$C: Cool story. (Why the fuck was this downvoted)
$C: Yeah, now we can reinstate the regulations that prevented The ISP's from throttling your internet speeds; what they never did that. Well, at least cell phone company had to ply by the same rules. What mobile ISP didn't have to abide by the rules and companies like T-mobile were able to discriminate again the origin of your data. Well, at least we can keep our bill low by preventing competition. 

I understand why people think we need net neutrality laws but the laws that were put in place in 2015 were far from perfect. Simply repealing that laws also didn't do much to solve the problems either. I am only able to get Comcast internet because there is a government ordinance e that say only Comcast can provide internet to me. A lot of the problems with cost and net neutrality could be solved if we did something to give me choice as a consumer.  

All I am saying is that it would make a lot more sense if they rewrote the existing bills adding stuff that would make the Republican happy and the Democrats. Instead, they do this because they know it is just going to waste time and not mean anything, It will also trick their constituents into reelecting their dumb asses. 

$C: Lmao celebrating government controlled internet. You cheer for being slaves without even knowing it. 
$C: Ajit gonna cry, go eat your curry !
$C: Good job, despacito.
$C: CAN YOU FINALLY SHUT UP ABOUT IT
$C: Lame
$C: You do know that it would be better if the government would stop creating internet provider monopolies. The free market would kick out those that would attempt to charge you access to certain sites and this law wouldn’t be needed. But let’s instead put government in charge to control a problem that the government created, what could go wrong. 
$C: This comment thread is a joke.  Whiny libs whining about an issue they don't understand using their principle-deficient brains.  Go ahead assholes and downvote me.  Like I care about your pathetic opinions and attempts to smear anyone that disagrees with you on any subject.  
$C: Wow. Don't you understand this is a disaster? This undermines the ability of the DOJ to prosecute people for censorship! We didn't have the problem with censorship until the Obama\-era trojan\-horse "Net Neutrality" was put in. Do you wish this to continue \(and get worse?\) 

Sessions is busy getting rid of the corruption right now. He will get around to using the tools of anti\-trust and Trump can use the tools of license terms for the broadcast media as soon as the alligators are vanquished. 

The Dems would like nothing better than to eliminate all the tools through the fictitiously named Net Neutrality and move it to arbitrary arbitration which essentially tears the teeth out of enforcement.
$C: You guys honestly think net neutrality is good? All this does is prevent innovation and progress in an ever expanding and thriving market. Apple would not be the company it is today if Net Neutrality existed 20 years ago. All you guys are doing is making it easier for the government to dictate what you can and cannot do on the internet and reinforcing that grip that Obama placed on an otherwise free market. Good job guys, that government you hate so much, just gave them more control. Idiots. 
$C: Who is this we and why do you assume that I'm on the side of more regulations?
$C: Net Neutrality. People seem to think this is a good thing. What people don't realize is that it prevents CAPITOLISM. if every internet site and provider is forced to give the same services, what motivation is there to improve their services. Let's say NN is lost and GCI stops providing most sites on their service. ATT, however, allows access to these sites without a deluxe package. Everyone will go to ATT. In order to win back customers, GCI would have to go above and beyond, IE faster access to those sites. 

See what I'm saying? If everyone is treated the same, you can't go above and beyond. It's like how in communist countries you can't become more rich than your neighbor; everything is provided as long as you do your job. 
$C: If you're a gamer that supports Net neutrality, you've lost any right to complain about lag. Net Neutrality means all data is treated equally regardless of content. That means that even though your ISP could prioritize live services like Xbox Live, Playstation Plus, online gaming or live streams over static content like webpages, music, youtube, netflix, etc. they would face harsh punishment for doing so.

When your wife or girlfriend gets on Netflix and your game of PUBG or Rocket League or Call of Duty goes to shit, it's because of Net Neutrality. Your ISP *could* prioritize your gaming data stream (and far better than a $300 gaming router) over Netflix, but legally they are not allowed.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Thats what we need, more regulations! Yay!
$C: The dummies who think net neutrality is good probably think the Democratic Republic of North Korea is a Democracy 
$C: peepee poopoo crap
$C: thank GOD for PRESIDENT TRUMP!! 😊❤🇺🇸👌🐸 can any of y'all imagine OBUMMER doing this, lmao nope thought not 😂🤣
$C: Wow. And all I had to do was nothing... go figure. 
$C: "We."

Speak for yourself.
$C: It makes me sad that people believe this. It won't ever pass the House, and even if it did, do you really think Trump would put it through?

There is no way in fuck that would ever happen. I think, at this point, all you people are doing is giving false hope to people who don't really know what they're talking about.

NN will never, ever be restored while Trump is in office, and by now, it's become a joke to think otherwise. I understand trying to be optimistic and involved in the process, but ... you realize Trump would have to sign off on this, right? Which is the complete antithesis of his entire agenda, which is to do the opposite of every single thing supported by the previous administration.

False hope is worse than hard reality. At least when you accept the reality, you can make a plan to deal with it. False hope just leaves you banging your head against a wall, accomplishing nothing, while giving yourself a headache. 
$C: Honestly, nobody fucking cares about this. We deserve to have no net neutrality, it's the best for us.
$C: idc
$C: [deleted]
$C: >~~Won~~ Lost

FTFY

Fuck NN
$C: Fuck off.
Trump is going to veto that shit and own you libtards
$C: Congrats America on voting away your internet freedom. You're one step closer to Chinese communism
$C: Democrats still reeeeeeeeesisting

Downvote if you’re a democrat and hate freedom. 
$C: Oh yay, more government. We’re saved /s
$C: Yea, this is definitely not supported by all Americans.

Especially ones that have experience in politics and tech, or realize that innovation occurs in lieu of regulation...which didn't occur before 2015.



$C: This is a negative.  
$C: What an awful decision. Hopefully the house ignores this pile of crap legislation that was completely based on lies. 
$C: Your evidence that you linked is a survey.This should tell anyone all they need to know about the clowns who are obsessed with putting the internet more into the hands of government.

To put it another way: Do you want Trump to control your internet? Campaign for NN if you want Trump to have more power over what content you enjoy online. Go. Do it.
$C: Fuck You reddit. You took my one dream of repealing net neutrality and killed it.
$C: What a bunch of leftist idiots! 
$C: We're going to keep an eye on things as they develop in the House and then evaluate the next course of action \(let us know if you have ideas!\). But yes, if this is important to you, there is no reason not to start letting your Representative know now. They need to know that their constituents care about this. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: >  House vote

You sweet summer child.

There will be no House vote.

DOA.
$C: There is virtually 0 possibility this will pass the house, let alone Trump who supports ending it. 
$C: Hopefully 
$C: Why bother?  There's zero chance that enough House Republicans will vote to pass it, and there's even less chance that Trump would sign it if they did.  

This was all a bunch of PR that the Senate did, nothing more.
$C: Yeah at midnight.
$C: Good comment 
$C: Lol, "House vote." Invertebro Ryan has made it abundantly clear that he has absolutely zero intent on bringing this to a floor vote. Our best shot is next January.
$C: This is a trick question...
$C: Pretty sure the house won't even bring it up the vote...
$C: I pray it will pass the house too. Too many evil people.
$C: Here I'll do it. "Speaker Ryan Refuses to Allow Net Neutrality Vote to the Floor, But Really Both Sides Have Things to Answer For Here."
$C: Fantastic News!! 😀
$C: Nah.
$C: I hope so. I'm already seeing a lot of people believe that it will be shot down in the House.

And if it does pass the House the other issue will be getting past Trump. 
$C: If it only passed 52-47 in the Senate, it's never getting past the House.
$C: Of course
$C: Great Answer I Really Like Your Words
$C: Probably not because theres zero chance it gets through the house 
$C: 
How we can win on Net Neutrality in Congress!
https://boingboing.net/2018/05/18/call-now-2.html

$C: lol
$C: Lol it's going to crash and burn in the house. You larpers follow anything 
$C: Gonna die in the house, sorry
$C: There won't be a House vote.
$C: I seriously doubt this even gets to a vote in the House
$C: I'll save you the hassle, it's never brought to the floor
$C: Part of me genuinely wonders how Ashit Pie is behaving right now. I'll bet he's having a good ole ugly cry in the bathroom mirror right now, blowing snot bubbles with his nose.
$C: I feel this is a realistic question: what happens if this hits Trump's desk?
$C: [deleted]
$C: I can see it now. 


> Reddit, the house did not pass net neutrality. PLEASE call your Congressman or the internet will stop existing!
$C: The dedication you comment a minute after this post came out, legend
$C: So-called net neutrality rules instead gave a false illusion of neutrality online and a false sense of protection. If anything, those rules singlehandedly weakened the free flow of information by empowering the world’s most powerful online companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter to censor speech, filter and manipulate information and abuse the collection of your personal data with absolutely no transparency or accountability
$C: Hopefully they vote no, or President Trump vetos it
$C: I see a correlation here 
$C: It’s telling that there are no Against’s with “Democrat” after their name...
$C: So why do Republicans not want net neutrality?
$C: Oh nice, a concise list of 47 people that should get voted out of office at the end of their next term.
$C: More people should be aware of this list
$C: Well would you look at that. Grassley and Ersnt both voted against. Screw you both.
$C: Of course both Texas guys voted against. With Corny Cornyn and Corrupted Cruz, you can always bet on them being on the crappy side of the issue.

I tried to call both of them, and only ever got robots. I emailed them and got automatic replies saying businesses need freedom to grow blah blah agree with Trump. 
$C: Fuck YOU, John Cornyn and Fuck YOU, Ted Cruz. I most definitely will do everything in my power to get those fucks out of office for good.
$C: "Both parties are the same!!!!!"

There's also a lot of false equivalence of Democrats and Republicans here ("but both sides!" and Democrats "do whatever their corporate owners tell them to do" are tactics Republicans use successfully) even though their voting records are not equivalent at all:

$C: As a Texan, I apologize for our dumbshits. 
$C: make sure you guys take note of this so you know who to vote out
$C: It’s almost as if that R beside their names is an indication that they’re bought and paid for by corporate interests and not the interests of their own constituents. 

Huh.
$C: Fucking Jeff Flake, man. Don't forget that despite all his pathetic hand wringing bullshit over Trump, he's still a lowlife Republican piece of shit that's so far in the pocket of corporate lobbies he can suck their dick from there. If he wasn't retiring, I hope Arizona would vote his pathetic ass out of office. Get fucked, Jeff Flake.
$C: A sea of red in the against. It's a shame given how there are younger people in the party who are in favour. Must be discouraging for the party you identify with most to not be in support of something so crucial to our economy.
$C: Wow, I’m proud of my senator for probably the first time ever! One of them at least. John kennedy. 
$C: I think I see a pattern...


All the people who voted for it made a good choice!

$C: Missourian here. Roy Blunt is a troll lookin ass bitch who has got to be stopped.
$C: We did it! New Jersey did something! First sports betting and now both senators voting for new neutrality, we’re slowly becoming a state that can be respected!

Probably not though
$C: Well, my Senators still suck ass
$C: Democrats: For the rights of the people. 
Republicans: For the profits of corporations. 
There isn't a better example of this than this fuckin vote. 
$C: Man I hate living in a red state.

Edit: don’t downvote comments that don’t agree with me, stay open minding people :)
$C: I can't believe Bernie Sanders is in fact called Bernard lmfao
$C: 2 republicans and 1 Independent voted for it along with every Democrat. Mean while most of the republicans are bought and paid for proving so by their vote. 
$C: Oh, Toomey, you predictable piece of shit.
$C: I don't get it, are those people not allowed to choose for themselves whether they vote yes or no?  Do they face repercussions if they do not vote according to their party's rules?  This shit looks like 2 hiveminds where 3 guys defected to the other team
$C: Lol steve daines can suck a fat one. Montana is so goddamn rural in places, we NEED A NEUTRAL INTERNET. Think I can sit in the middle of bumfuck nowhere in the dead of winter with restricted internet? Fuck that! 
$C: And there's Rand Paul making me ashamed to be from KY again.  What a flip flopping, lying, party line following piece of shit he is.  
$C: Why is the topic of net neutrality such a black and white (Dems vs. Republican) issue? I'd imagine we could all equally agree that net neutrality is a great thing for the citizens of America, and I feel the only reason you would be against net neutrality is if you're goal was to give even more power to the already corrupt mega ISP corporations. 

Please somebody inform me of what's going on?
$C: Why didn't one dude vote
$C: Get better John!
$C: God damn it Boozman. Based on his record I should of expected it. GOOD THING IM OLD ENOUGH TO VOTE. Sit back and watch government. Yall messed with a generation right before they were old to enough to act. We're coming for them jobs of yours. I'mma vote your ass outta there.
$C: Apologies from Idaho, we're bought and payed for over here and we'll be electing the same guys again more than likely.
$C: Thanks for posting the list. I actually took the time to email the three Republicans who voted to restore.
$C: Dang it John 
$C: My Kansas senators continue to disappoint me.
$C: > Sullivan, Dan (Republican - Arkansas)

Should be: Sullivan, Dan (Republican - Alaska)
$C: Fucking Mitch McConnell. 
$C: Good to know who to vote for! ;)

Really glad that I took my time and told all my reps, I've really learned how much a person's vote matters this year's in school, and I'll be sure to vote to show it! Nice job Redditors!
$C:  Thanos, you know what to do...
$C: Just wanna go on record and say:



Fuck John Cornyn in particular. I did that "save the net" email to my reps and got what i assume was a form letter response from his office. 


He "appreciates that net neutrality is an important issue to many of his constituents" but it's important to get rid of this "1920s style Obama era regulation" because it "impedes the growth of business".
$C: being a level headed conservative in this country is probably not fun when the entire Republican party is full of shit heads like this

$C: Republicans- get your heads out of your party’s ass!* And wisen the fuck up, clearly you shouldn’t piss off internet-loving voters. 

*(I consider myself leaning republican and I’m thoroughly ashamed of them on this issue.)
$C: Ducking Marco Rubio, atleast the other Florida senator voted for
$C: Perhaps we can all write one large thank you card with our signatures.
$C: Rand Paul's my boi, tho.
$C: Holy crap! My senators actually did something good for us once!
$C: Proud of our republican in Louisiana voted for net neutrality. One of only two republicans to do so.  
$C: Wow. I'm actually surprised Menendez voted for it
$C: Holy shit, one of our Republican senator voted for! Thanks John Kennedy!
$C: Grateful for any list that portrays Alabama as progressive.
$C: I don't know how anyone with more than half a brain could be a Republican. 
$C: Nice! Alabama votes for!
$C: Proud of you, Doug Jones. Fuck you, Shelby. 
$C: Way to go Texas
$C: Mother fucking Jeff Flake.  Pay attention Arizona.
$C: Man, it's time like these I hate my Iowan senators.....
$C: Why wasn’t McCain voting?
$C: I called Sen. Murkowski (ak) yesterday.
She listened to me! Lol
$C: It never ceases to make me laugh that 4chan and r/The_Donald are proud they voted for Trump for president 
$C: Damn the parties are so partisanly divided. Insane stuff.
$C: Damnit, Texas. 
$C: I was voting against Crapo anyways. 
$C: Cliques exist at every level of life
$C: KAINE BRING THE PAIN!


...I might've let my pro-Virginian side out.
$C: I’m upset that Sullivan (Alaska) voted against... (I used to live there) no one likes dan Sullivan anyway, though. 

I’m upset because Alaska has terrible internet statewide and net neutrality being removed would do awful things for the state. 
$C: Very suspicious pattern between Republicans and Democrats and how they voted
$C: What is McCain doing? Has he just taken his ball and gone home? Not playing the game anymore? 
$C: Well Portman, you've lost my vote from now on
$C: So Robert Casey has my vote and fuck Pat Toomey. Got it.
$C: Wow can't believe Kennedy voted for this bill. One of the first times I feel my voice was heard. 
$C: Well, predictable that 99% of Democrat voted FOR and 100% of Republicans voted AGAINST.
$C: And once again my senator Marco Rubio does not fail to disappoint mec
$C: eeeee
$C: Better to have them explained in detail than to have FOX News explain how net neutrality is a LIBTURD, Trump-hating conspiracy.
$C: How was it explained? Just curious, was it biased or was it done as objectively as possible? 
$C: Here's how Republicans "explain" it. It's a regulation put in place by OBAMA!!! It must go!!!
$C: I think after the Zuckerberg hearing people realized the problem lay in ignorance.
$C: And yet, lawmakers only barely passed 50% :/
$C: As trump said, I love the poorly educated.
$C: If we lost the "Obama-era" adjective, this would be a lot easier.  It's quite divisive as it adds a political connotation to a bipartisan issue.
$C: Oh. Damn. Don't know how I missed that. That really calls into question thise stats...
$C: Remember those studies of how many people were against Obamacare but were for the Affordable Health Care act?
$C: 25% of Republicans still didn't get it.
$C: Who explained it and how did they explain it? 
$C: Perhaps that’s what Republican voters think but certainly not their senators considering the 47 against votes
$C: I don’t get it. Why is everything with Obama’s name on it actively being discontinued or the attempt is being made? Why? It’s one guy...do you really not have anything better to worry about? 

$C: BIG LUL. 
$C: Has to be since people usually gloss over key wording
$C: This is why it’s so important to keep getting the word out! Make sure politicians know where the will of the people lies 
$C: Sums up modern politics really.
$C: I’ve also found that most people who are okay with it being removed either don’t understand what it would do, or don’t believe companies would actually do the things they will be allowed to do.
$C: I'm in favor of net neutrality, but I'm curious how this explanation is worded. If someone is completely ignorant to something, I could make them believe anything if I said it with enough bias.

Edit: I say this because I know a decent amount of people against it - even though they understand the implications of net neutrality, or rather, a world without it.
$C: The republican talking point right now is "less regulation on the internet."  That is resounding with republicans who don't do any further research.  We need an information campaign to combat this.
$C: I feel like this is most things with republicans, though.
$C: Translation: after they were lied to
$C: And it was still just a 52-47 vote. Fucking imbeciles shouldn't vote on stuff they don't have a solid understanding of.
$C: Always amazing that people, who have not the slightest clue about an issue, get to decide for everyone about the outcome. Not sure if i should laugh or feel sad.
$C: Was that the same polls that told us Hillary had an 87% chance of being the first female president!   Doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result, is the definition of insanity! 
$C: Good luck having 300M people have the patience to hear it out. NN haters didn't know what it was until Fox told them to hate on it.
$C: There’s nothing Obama did that’s worth keeping.
$C: **after the issue was explained from a one sided, technically illiterate position** would be more accurate.

Learn how networks work people. Get rid of monopolies, don't entrench them.
$C: Yeah, and then once the issue is re-explained to them with different facts, how many of these people will then favour keeping Trump era rules? 

Let's be honest, probably most of them.
$C: Personally, it was the opposite for me, I was up in arms until I actually researched it, then it made sense to do away with it the more I understood.

Edit: Getting hit with the down vote avalanche.
I'm probably misinformed, but what I gathered when I read up on it was, on a very basic level, as a result of net neutrality internet costs are kind of spread out among everyone regardless of their usage. So it's a beneficial to me, as someone who uses a lot of larger services that are able to have lower subscription fees thanks to net neutrality, but for someone who only needs internet service for basic thigs (email, etc) they're getting overcharged to compensate.
I feel like we should have to pay for what we use instead of forcing others who don't need the service to pay more in order to lower the cost for those that do.
Now like I said I could be way off, but that was my understanding when I read a bit about it last summer/fall. 
$C: Are you sure they had it explained to them and not had someone lie to them? Because Net Neutrality is not what they claim it is. It's pretty much the opposite. It destroys internet freedom and makes everything more expensive and slower. Here's why:

By "explained" this actually means "REPUBLIKKKANS WILL KILL YOU AND YOUR BABIES IF THIS PASSES".

Typical lying liberals. 

Please downvote the facts, lying liberals! If you think this will prevent the truth from being heard, you're mistaken! Hahahahaha god I love being right. 
$C: What we must spread on the internet should be that we know who to vote for next elections. 

That way those politicians who voted NO would get pressured.

I'm not an analyst but I saw it happen when the Congress voted to remove Human Rights in my country. We spread the word that we know who to vote for and who to not.
$C: Don't forget that the midterms are even more important than this one thing and will have a much bigger effect on saving net neutrality. Go and out vote.

$C: It's actually better than we hoped. There was 50 yes votes for sure and we were trying to swing one more. 
$C: It is incredibly close, but compared to recent votes a win is a win. I really hope this continues for the betterment of not only the US, but for the rest of the world that would be affected by this.
$C: It's actually not all that close. Most issues are voted based on party lines. We have two political parties in US, usually what one likes the other one doesn't. It is much more common to have votes like this instead of i.e. 70-30.

Republican's have 51 seats while Democrats have 47, with the other 2 being independent. IMO close is anything 51-49 or 51-50 (where VP votes).
$C: I Canadian here, following it for quite sometime.

As soon as it is gets legalized, our own firms will rush to implement it as well, which is why I am also interested in it.
$C: Most partisan issues go exactly 49-51. So the fact that there was 3 defectors is a lot. The sad part is just that it became partisan at all. Hopefully we can educate the public about the issue before the politicians get the chance to. If they do, then it'll become the next global warming "debate"
$C: I agree with you 100%, PMme-boobiesnbutts.
$C: The concept of “close” in the U.S. senate is more about bipartisan support than actual numbers. In a 50-50 senate the President’s party will win the vote and it won’t be considered close, because usually it’s a predictable partisan split with the Vice President breaking the tie. Nobody would be saying “aw shucks, so close.”

A “close” vote is one in which just enough majority senators are considering crossing over. I would call this close even though they got more than they needed, simply because the margin of making that political decision was probably quite thin for those Republicans who joined the Democrats.
$C: It's basically half Democrats half Republicans so whoever has a president in he White House is gonna vote together and the other party will have to sway their votes along with the neutral and independants.
$C: Votes in America also tend to have a lot of room where some vote for or against something because they know voting for it won't change the result but may impact them negatively.

If this was a veto from the president being voted on the votes would completely matter if it passed. That's unlikely to happen considering the Republicans have been voting party over country for 8 years now. 
$C: Lol they didn’t read that shit. 
$C: Never underestimate the power of the internet
$C: What happens in the US sets tone for the rest of the world in most cases, its the world's largest economy. As a citizen of Earth, we should voice our opinions even if it doest affect us in the short run. It will be crucial in the long run.
$C: >	I know that if it had went the other way it would affect more than just people in the US 

No you don’t know that. No one knows pretty much anything, it’s mostly based on speculation and fear.
$C: It is close.  But that is how most shit seems to happen in the US government.  This was just a symbolic victory though, which is probably why it was successful.  Senators are trying to grab some political karma when it doesn't matter so they have karma to burn when it matters.
$C: The House will never pass it and if they do then Trump will veto. Senate will never get 60 votes. Game over. 

I still have my Netflix and my speed has increased to 100 Mb/sec up and down. 
$C: >  I know that if it had went the other way it would affect more than just people in the US but in a lot of other places too, so thanks everyone who put time / effort into this whole thing.

It probably won't affect you either way.

It will tend to speed up internet and lower costs in the US.
$C: He's contradicted himself in the span of the SAME TWEET. 
$C: He's been known to change his mind from something completely normal to something completely bonkers just because Obama wouldn't have done it.
$C: Just depends on how much money is offered for him to change his mind on some things.
$C: “If you like your doctor you can keep them”
-Barrack Obama

All of our presidents have “changed their mind”

$C: Do you want a leader who is incapable of changing their mind on things? Should obama and Hillary have held onto their marriage is between a man and woman stance?
$C: #this is important

The senate passed it, but Trump will not sign it, and it's unlikely to pass the House. 

#every single senator who voted against it was a Republican

$C: Been fighting various internet bullshit since SOPA. I’ll never give up.
$C: Yeah, but the House has yet to vote and it does not look too promising there
$C: Call your House representatives and urge them to vote for net neutrality. There's still a long fight to go.
$C: It's not a big win at all. all it changes is that the house has to vote on it now.
$C: It's not a win yet, it needs to pass the House as well, and then not get vetoed by the cheeto in chief.
$C: Which is dumb. If something gets voted down how are they able to keep trying to pass it through? WTF Merica. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: I’m against net neutrality.

I want to be able to watch my porn in peace.

Wait.

Or is it for net neutrality. 


I’m confused.
$C: Not sure what the exact odds would be, but for what its worth Net Neutrality has bipartisan support among citizens. I'm sure some of them are more concerned about reelection than party dogma.
$C: not really, but it gives them a nice hot pile of fuck-you to take with them into the 2018 midterms.
$C: No. My guess is this will die in the House. Today’s vote was nothing more than symbolic. 
$C: No. Telecoms are probably signing checks as we speak. 
$C: No.  NPR reported that it's a hallow victory since there is no chance it passes in the House.  There are supposedly some lawsuits filed or being filed against the FCC with regard to Net Neutrality.
$C: Absolutely not. Taking away net neutrality means $$$ for telecoms, which are big companies. 
Trump is a businessman. All he sees is $$$. 
$C: No. 
$C: Of course not.  They're republicans.
$C: No, Trump cares about bribes more than common citizens.
$C: no
$C: [deleted]
$C: Given that midterms are right around the corner, its possible. I doubt Trump would sign it, unless we bombard him with tens of thousands phone calls, emails, and letters. 
$C: There’s absolutely no chance at all 
$C: If it passes the House, it's unlikely to go through Trump without a veto. If he does veto, then it's back to the House and Senate to get a 2/3rds majority to override the veto, which is unlikely because another 14 republicans would have to change their mind.
$C: Did you see the list of yes and no votes? ALL the No’s were Republican.

This will not come close to getting a floor vote.

The committee (controlled by the Majority party, Republicans) will likely not let the bill be considered.

The House Majority Speaker (Republican Paul Ryan) would hypothetically then schedule the vote, which he will not because even if it could pass with bipartisan support, it is not supported by the “majority of the majority” (Republicans). This is an informal rule named after imprisoned child molester (they only got him on the coverup, unfortunately) and previous Republican House Speaker Dennis Hastert.

And it is very likely that Trump would veto if the bill somehow cleared the previous hurdles.

Without a bill coming to a floor vote, Republican Congress persons who would have voted no can now say whatever they think will get them re-elected.

The maddening part about following politics for over a decade is the vast amount of ignorance. Outside of exceptional circumstances, R’s controlling the House and Presidency will obviously mean NN has no chance or being passed. It’s somewhat similar to the repeated Republican “repeal Obamacare” votes, except that R’s had no plan for success and NN is well-considered policy that accounts for the actual state of the world.
$C: Trump would probably be fine with it, as he was basically just not happy about the FCC "legislating".

The house I do not know.
$C: Not from a Jedi.
$C: They know the public wants it. They just don't care.
$C: > hopefully politicians finally get it through their heads that the public wants this

lol.

$C: Tbh I actually think the president would let it pass. He doesn't really understand it at all, but if he sees both a republican controlled house and republican controlled senate vote for it, he will probably make it happen. He's an idiot, but he does try to appear populist, and this would be a beneficial political move for him. It would make it look like hes listening to the voice of the people, and it would force a lot of people who hate him to give him some small amount of credit.

However he also appointed Ajit Pai, so we'll see
$C: The public wants it but Republicans know it's an issue that is safe for most of them to oppose.
$C: What happens if Trump doesn’t sign it?
$C: The problem is that the people who want this don't vote.   Full stop.  The people who don't want this vote at high high rates in the primary. 
$C: Republican Politicians*.
$C: They know what the public wants. But might I present a counter point

***$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$***
$C: We've shot down SOPA and a bunch of other bills trying to get rid of net neutrality and somehow they snuck it through the FCC. Ugh. 
$C: I'm more worried about the house.  ~~Loki~~ Trump is a 50/50 on any given policy it seems.
$C: They already know the public wants this. There's no possible way they *can't* know that the public wants this. The problem is that they don't care because what the public wants conflicts with what their pockets want.
$C: I'm not so much worried about the House of Representatives. I'm almost positive that they will vote similarly to the Senate. The real battle is whether or not trump will veto the bill should it reach his desk. I'm almost positive if Trump were to veto the net neutrality bill, he will be lynched during the 2020 debates. Net neutrality will become a huge battleground for trump and the democrats in 2020. His safe move would be to sign the bill and have somewhat of a chance of getting reelected in 2020. 
$C: The bill needs a provision that states 

> President Trump is the greatest president ever, greater than Abraham Lincoln. Tremendous man, and women love him. They all love him.

Then he will sign it.
$C: Can someone explain to me what the argument is against net neutrality? It seems like only internet companies and large companies have anything to gain by it, so it’s crazy to me that so many lawmakers would vote against it. Why would a regular person be against net neutrality?
$C: This is a big first step though! 
$C: No we don’t 

https://youtu.be/dh8sVHb5oOA
$C: Trump was for net neutrality, so I dont see him being an issue
$C: I'm the public and I disagree with NN.

$C: Ajit is just Republican stooge. Replace him with any hack for the Republicans and you’d get the same exact policy.
$C: Eat a shit pie Ajit Pai.
$C: my ass stinks today. probably because i haven't wiped today, or ever
$C: Wow, be more racist.
$C: essentially it's going to die in the house, but republicans will be on record as having voted against it or refused to vote prior to the elections in November.
$C: Trump wouldn't sign it anyway.
$C: POTUS will have to sign the law. He won't. He is on the same side as Pai. Unfortunately none of this will matter
$C: Vote republicans out. Thats the best way to save an open internet.
$C: Vote Republicans out of the house. 
$C: > What's the plan going forward?

Bludgeon Republicans with ads saying they voted to sell out the internet and their constituents to companies like Comcast and Charter all the way until election day.
$C: It has no chance, and will amount to nothing. 
$C: So-called net neutrality rules instead gave a false illusion of neutrality online and a false sense of protection. If anything, those rules singlehandedly weakened the free flow of information by empowering the world’s most powerful online companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter to censor speech, filter and manipulate information and abuse the collection of your personal data with absolutely no transparency or accountability
$C: Unfortunately you are right, it won’t be read. I sent an email to my congressman (Duncan Hunter) and got an obviously automated message but just in case I responded to see what “he’d” say. Received the same exact email. They don’t care. As long as when they look into their bank accounts, and the checks have cleared, the rest is irrelevant.
$C: That's really well-written.  Good job on messaging your congressman, I wish more people did the same.

$C: My letter was more practical. "I know you don't give a shit about me, and I don't give a shit about you. If net neutrality is overturned on your watch you'll have my vote. If it's not, my vote will go to whoever is most likely to take your seat."
$C: Wow. Recently just came from under and rock and found out about the fight for net neutrality. This post just hit home, and I finally understand it. Time to start spreading the word. 
$C: Is your congressman a Republican? I'd love to be able to pretend I'm helping by emailing mine, but I'm from Massachusetts and I already know they are voting the way I want. 
$C: Damn son. 
$C: Truly, man of the hour
$C: Lol like he'll want to meet with you. 
$C: You'll buy the coffee?? god that's so freaking cringey
$C: I stopped reading at "I pray". 
$C: > It is terrifying the amount of energy it takes us to overtake these issues, and these are just the ones we happen to be passionate about.   


Keep in mind, we’re still a very small minority. Not many people even know what Net Neutrality is, nowadays. So even if we are passionate, we’re just not enough to matter.

If everyone was educated enough on this topic, even Trump would be forced to get on board. Even a strong majority of Republicans/anti-Obummers believe that Net Neutrality is good. But the problem is, the movement just hasn’t got enough traction because the media doesn’t decide to shine the light it deserves (for obvious reasons.) This is why we don’t let 6 companies control all of television/movies...
$C: Could someone ELI5 the arguments of the people for and against net neutrality in as objective a way as possible? 
$C: >Well dressed, scotch-buying lobbyists with a checkbook must be extremely hard to ignore.

Well, money pays the bills, and votes don't pay the bills.
$C: Or the amount of people not bitching about NN is higher than you think. There is a reason for the saying "silent majority". 
$C: nothing was overtaken, this is just midterm positioning.

it will never get voted on in house
$C: Congressman Mike Doyle (D-PA) is launching a discharge petition on an identical House resolution (H.J.Res. 129).  To compel its consideration on the House floor, he'd need all the Democrats to sign it, as well as approximately 25 Republicans -- which means it won't happen.  But the procedure is there.  
$C: Yup. This is just a stance for midterm votes. It wasn't ever really expected to be a real thing.
$C: Can it be voted for at any time? Even if it’s a year or more out? I can see that being a good thing if they don’t vote and we get more people in favor of NN in the House. 
$C: Yup. The real vote for net neutrality was November 2016.
$C: [removed]
$C: This. Even if it did get to the House, the chances of it passing are next to nothing. The Senate vote only occurred in order to garner political support for the Democrats in the upcoming election. They knew this would never actually achieve anything. It's political pandering...And it worked.
$C: Even simpler. Go out and vote for anyone but the republican. You will have voted against them. 
$C: Here is as list of everyone who voted against it:

$C: Every single person who voted against was Republican so just vote against all the Republicans 
$C: You are going to tell people to vote against these people without knowing anything about the rest of their policies or the people running against them... People like you are baffling stupid 
$C: Ajit Pai is a carefully manufactured scapegoat. He's the fall guy. Don't buy into it. He was told what to do on purpose, so when Net Neutrality is gutted, the public will focus their anger on him instead of the cowards in Congress who took money to actually vote against it.
$C: Hey now, don't disgrase the art of dick-sucking like that. 
$C: Yeah. And he has a particularly punchable face. 
$C: But the big corporations are for net neutrality...
$C: corporate cock and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups
$C: By corporate cock you mean a fuck ton of money
$C: Same with all these corrupt fuckers in the south.
$C: The opposite.  Corporations are basically buying Ajit Pai to do their bidding.

Edit: Woo, lots of salt here, relax I'm on your side.

$C: Eh this is where I think partisan politics has ruined America.... I’m a conservative and deeply oppose repealing net neutrality. Hell, I don’t know anyone who uses a computer who is in favor of it. I don’t think it even needs to be partisan; liberals and conservatives alike hate Comcast monopolies. This is why party agendas are damaging, people. -.-
$C: Some things Dems do well, others Conservatives.

Republicans just do fuck all 
$C: Aggggh it’s about political views now
$C: Though there's no contest that the stances on the issues are different, **why** they (congressmen) vote the way they do is the same: money. That's what politics comes down to, anywhere in the world, under any system, at any time. 

Both parties have only a single interest: keeping themselves in power. Do not think they, in the grand scheme of things, care in the slightest about democracy, or helping people, or representing citizens. Most politicians act purely out of self-interest. 

For all but the three Republicans that vote against NN, at the moment they perceive that voting in favor of NN would cost them support with their lobbyists (it may cost them a few votes too, but once you're in it isn't really a concern about getting reelected legitimately, just if you can raise the money to buy propaganda. That's why congressmen don't change that often). For the Democrats, they perceive that their lobbyists want them to vote for NN. 

Don't forget, both parties are in agreement on very unpopular issues: taxes, government spending, war on terror, etc.
$C: And yet they passed passed FOSTA-SESTA near unanimously with the Republicans. They might be better, but that's not saying very much. 
$C: There's differences, but not on the biggest issues. Which are deficit spending, and military intervention, business, and personal life intervention
$C: Because those 83% are average people who hear about it purely from sources like this that frame it as this Jesus law that is the obvious moral high ground, when in reality it’s a lot more of a blurred line when it comes down to it, but the dems only tell you what they want you to hear
$C: It's a stupid issue understood by no one. Net Neutrality is a joke. 
$C: This is why it’s super important to actually educate yourself and others and not just blindly believe whatever you’re told.
$C: In his defense, in the years this has been getting passed around the internet, I have seen exactly one article that actually articulates the argument against net neutrality.

I really think this holds us back, everybody calling and writing their legislators uses templates and key-words that practically scream "I have not taken the time to understand your perspective".
$C: If he's a low use general user or even an email only use person than it probably would be cheaper for him to get a plan customized around that.
$C: "Obama bad, libural tears, democrats want more regulation over the interwebs and all regulations are going to cost you money." Fox news actual talking points. "This is a push by the obama administration to control the internet." Direct quote.

People who watch that garbage will parrot that back like they know what they're talking about.
$C: That's the main problem. Some months ago i wanted to check out how that bastard of ajit would even try to advertise the vote against net neutrality and i noticed that he is one smooth piece of shit. He puts it in a way so it looks like net neutrality is bad and he is doing the right thing. Got me so confused i had to google about net neutrality cause i started to think i got it all wrong. 
$C: Republicans are like the villains from Captain Planet.
$C: I’ll vote republican😊 Thanks for the reminder 
$C: All of 47 of them republicans.

To those of you "Both sides are the same" fuckers.
$C: Well, they care if you're a big donor, I reckon.
$C: Why is it that caring about people means that the government has to be in charge of the internet rules? 
$C: It demonstrated the Democrats are in the pocket of the big content providers on the west coast. 
$C: This would work if and only if there was competition in the market. Otherwise the ISP can say "ok pull your site, it will cost you about 10 million per day in lost revenue, our users will be pissed off, but they can't use another ISP so they will find another web site."
$C: The big sites would profit from not having net neutrality. They can use their influence to push out smaller competitors out of the market.    
That is one of the huge issues and also one of the reasons why it is unlikely that the internet giants will intervene.
$C: Reddit is not about to hurt their user numbers for this. 
$C: >	If reddit simply banded with other major sites and refused to serve their site up to any ISP that throttled sites then it would be over. 

Which ISP throttles sites? Also, what constitutes a “site” when it comes to BitTorrent etc.?
$C: They would die before ISP does. 

Plus, the bigger your service/website, the more you benefit from having NO net neutrality.
$C: passing the senate means nothing considering the House won't even bring this bill up for a vote and DJT would never sign it.

It's all for show.

This bill is DOA.
$C: Hear, hear!
$C: Dig the trenches and reload the meme-machine guns, the worst is yet to come
$C: /r/cringe
$C: In this environment, finding three out of fiftyish Republicans responsive to the interest of the people is actually a huge win.
$C: You can pitch making the internet a utility, but you have to tell those who don't agree *why* it should be a utility.

It should be a utility, in my opinion, because when you look at other things that are utilities it just makes sense.

Gas?  Is gas and electric really *required* to survive?  No.

But does it raise the quality of life and help advance us as a race?  Yes.

So does knowledge, and the internet gives us knowledge.  Sure, it can be used for bad.  So can gas.  You can make bombs!  So can electricity...you can make uh..remotes for the bombs!

The positives of the internet far outweigh the negatives.  The lack of knowledge and/or abuse of knowledge is what causes genocides.      The internet is a vital part in our culture that I believe has either halted entirely or at the least postponed the next mass human extermination.  

The internet gave us a way to connect to everyone and at least learn other perspectives instead of being force fed information from a tight knit community.

Understanding of each other's differences and knowing more about how the world works makes us more conscious of our decisions and how they affect the things around us.

Its entire existence is the usage of it.  If no one used the internet, the internet would have no use.    

That alone makes it a utility, not to mention other reasons.
$C: >	In today’s day and age, the Internet is just as crucial to our standard of living as electricity is. 

It really isn’t, though (personal access), especially when you consider libraries and net cafes etc. 
$C: This is the sensible mentality we need. 
$C: gtfo shill
$C: Isn’t it fascinating that it’s a partisan issue that 83% of everyone regardless of party supports? Almost like one half of this equation doesn’t respect their constituents wishes. 
$C: Who were the 3 Republicans I can't load the link
$C: I don't understand how anyone votes Republican unless you are a stinking rich fat cat. 
$C: Both parties are the same on most issues. Both are authoritarians and interventionists spending us into the ground.
$C: It's fair to say that members of both parties tend to be more interested in kickbacks and personal gain than in actually doing their jobs. It's fair to say both parties are full of slimy, corrupt individuals. It's fair to say that both parties have members who gravitate towards undesirable extremes. It's fair to point out that significant percentages of members of both parties are there because they're rich cunts and not because they're good at serving the public.

It's fair to say both parties suck dick.

The difference is in *how* they fuck us over. The Republican party tends to be much more destructive, making the Democrats only the lesser of evils. I'll take it, don't get me wrong, but I'm not gonna pretend the Democrat party is a party "for the people" or that it's made up primarily of principled do\-gooders.
$C: > The "both parties are the same" argument is as dumb of a statement as "Red and green are the same because they're both colors."

Your statement is about as dumb as "a rapist is a good person because he doesn't kill people and a murder is bad because he does"

America is an oligarchy. Cash passes law, period. Not just when the GOP does it. Just because you got thrown a bone today doesn't change that.   
$C: This right here. All this celebration feels very premature with all the hurdles you mentioned we have yet to cross. 
$C: More fuel for the fire.
$C: This will not be a key campaign issue in the mid-terms. The majority of the voting public does not know what this is.
$C: Trump hasn't vetoed any legislation yet so if it gets to him there's a decent chance it will go through.
$C: Yup. And the likelihood of that is pretty slim unfortunately 
$C: Also don't forget to vote in primaries. That's where you might find republicans who support net neutrality. 
$C: You did urge them but still aparently they didnt listen, did they?
$C: The crazy thing is this used to be a [Republican issue](http://www.cc.org/fast_facts_conservatives_net_neutrality) (that post is from 2006). What the hell happened? (The answer is probably money from telecommunication companies).
$C: If it were a non-party issue you would see more Democrats voting against.  You can't tell me politicians on one side are somehow immune to lobbying.... It's a big government vs small government issue.  Can people who put money into something decide how they handle that something.  That sounds exactly like a party issue.
$C: Campaign donations from large telecoms most likely.
$C: Momma Verizon's throwing cash at them
$C: $$$
$C: Because of corporate "donations".
$C: You keep saying net neutrality... I don't think you know what it means.
$C: It's stupid. 
$C: It feasible could be cheaper, like you get $10 off a month if you only use 20hrs of video per month.

Though myself I agree we need access to the whole internet.

or, the only thing Republicans care about.  
  
Got it? Welcome to the """"""""land of the free"""""""". :))))))))))
$C: Good timing. Im at a pub right now. Cheers for now!
$C: Lets get drunk and jerk of to pornstars that vaguely resemble celebrities we're crushing on and use highly advanced technology to make fake celeb porn on the side because we're incels.
$C: Do it.
$C: Not. Yet.
$C: Mr. Speaker we are for the big
$C: Hello, there!
$C: Something darth plagueis the wise
$C: # I. Am. The Senate.
$C: I told you it would come to this, the right wing is taking over! 
$C: It was actually a bit of an effort to get a few republicans on board. 
$C: I would dubious we'd get another Republican outside of Collins. Turns out we got two :)
$C: If you're wanting an actual unbiased opinion, then it's more complicated than "Republicans are evil". While Net Neutrality is 100% the biggest issue, and there isn't any diminishing that the Republicans are being coerced with money from ISPs to potentially allow them to construct "internet high ways", right now Net Neutrality comes from Title 2 which ultimately treats all ISPs the same regarding of how big or small they are. It is consumer friendly to an extent, until you get to the competition (or lack thereof) between ISPs due to the harder entry new ISPs have to go through. 

Net Neutrality is definitely the thing we need to focus on saving, but there is an actual argument against Title 2. If it wasn't for Net Neutrality than it would (other than the FCC not pushing it) kinda be beneficial to repeal it for consumers as well by giving a market that's more free. 
$C: Because they're corrupt.
$C: So-called net neutrality rules instead gave a false illusion of neutrality online and a false sense of protection. If anything, those rules singlehandedly weakened the free flow of information by empowering the world’s most powerful online companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter to censor speech, filter and manipulate information and abuse the collection of your personal data with absolutely no transparency or accountability
$C: They’re greedy republicans being paid by telecoms to kill net neutrality
$C: Because our political framework works off of a system of legal bribery. 
$C: Most people want to keep it because they don't know what it really is.

People are told (like the other reply), it is to stop a "internet high way" where some sites speeds are slowed down and others speed up. The problem with this is that ISP has never done that and net neutrality does and means much more then that.

Net neutrality gives the government control over all the internet since it would classify the internet as a utility and allows them to censor anything they don't like (like North Korea does). That is why Democrats voted for it and Republicans voted against. 

I'm against the net neutrality bill. Hard to say 'majority' though, there are large groups that are against it, but they get voted down here on reddit.
$C: There are actually people who believe that because "the people" want to tell a specific business how to operate that isn't a good enough reason to restrict their ability to operate how they wish.
$C: Because some people don’t want to give the government that kind of control and/or feel like it’s an unconstitutional overreach of power. 
$C: Republicans voting on party lines, being bought out by ISPs, or because "these Obama era regulations need to be destroyed!!!".
$C: anti-Obamaism and they're aggressively sucking corporate cock
$C: Because the internet worked fine before net neutrality, and we don't need hundreds of pages of increased regulations to make it harder to get into the internet business.

Oh wait, this is Reddit. Republicans voted that way because drumpf cheeto small hands Voldemort etc.
$C: So what’re we gonna do with this info? Send them hate mail? /s
$C: He's on the election commission as well?
$C: Celeberate the little wins!

We need to keep up morale for the long slog ahead of us.

Today we won a key battle, but we've still got to win the war.

$C: Net Neutrality means Internet Service Providers cannot alter/restrict what's on the web for profit. The common example is being charged an extra $5 for Facebook, or Reddit. Maybe a $15 social media bundle.

ISPs want Net Neutrality gone because it opens up new revenue streams. The thing is, the federal government PAID ISPs for the infrastructure to access the internet. So the ISPs trying to regulate the internet is baffling and giving them access would open up a whole can of worms.

It's been shown that nearly every Republican representative has been lobby- I mean bribed by these ISPs, to push for no Net Neutrality

$C: ELI5 Net neutrality 
https://youtu.be/dh8sVHb5oOA
$C: For Pai, repealing "net neutrality" wasn't done to bolster the bottom line of ISPs. Rather, it was to enable the very sort of innovation and experimentation that has worked so well from the early days of the commercialized internet. Giving the government the ability to regulate business models is rarely a good idea, especially in fast-changing tech fields; there will be many competing models and many will die while some flourish. Pai's FCC still insists on transparency from ISPs and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) would be able to investigate anti-competitive practices by ISPs (Pai says that the FTC is actually better suited to this sort of role than the FCC, which is open to question).
$C: I love the republic.
$C: Seems more like republicans hate net neutrality.. 
$C: Just wait till you learn what Reddit did to /r/the_donald 
$C: What do you mean? how would Net Neutrality prevent putting ads up? As a matter of fact it would make smaller companies harder to find with search regulations?
$C: I am definitely worried about his orange ass but there is a process to override a veto. Maybe one of our fellow kind redditors will educate us
$C: It would be an absurd thing to veto, and it's not where he directly enriches himself.  
$C: (The FCC is an independent agency of the government, no direct correlation from the branches to them though, just staggered appointments. Just thought you should know)
$C: I overheard Ajit saying he was having a good day protecting the operations of American big business until 97DennisRodman made fun of him for selling out to the business structure of the country he lives in!
Silly Ajit.    
$C: Reddit didn't get anyone killed, but yes, that meme did start because Reddit accused someone innocent for being the boston bomber, but they had died few weeks prior to that event. 

Really, even for Reddit, I'm surprised how insensitive the admins are. 

What the fuck? 
$C: i dont think the majority of people realize that
$C: Can I get an explanation or link on that?
$C: Woah what’s the story there?
$C: LE REDDIT ARMY DID IT!!!!!!
$C: > Jeez. You realize that meme started because Reddit got someone killed? 

Holy shit I did not know that
$C: You're right. 

Democrats are bought out by Zuckerberg and Pichai. There's no way they'd vote against NN.

And Republicans are sticking to the less government, less regulations values that they were elected for.
$C: Republicans are against net neutrality because Obama was for it. Everything out of a conservative's mouth is motivated by racism.
$C: There are only 49 democrats in the senate at the moment, so that would mean 4 republicans voted for it.  Some hope at least!
$C: [deleted]
$C: Pretty much everyone on Reddit would have a year ago.
$C: So abolish the FCC.
$C: My understanding is a significant -- and growing -- chunk of Republican seats in Congress are going to flip this November.
$C: It's been like that for a very very very very long time.
$C: Not. Yet.
$C: Net neutrality basically means data is data.

Under a net neutral condition, your ISP can't charge you extra for certain sites, nor can they prioritize some sites over others (legally. Whether or not it happens is a different matter).

If net neutrality were repealed, ISPs could quietly block websites they don't approve of - remove them from Google searches, redirect you if you type in the address, just completely shut them off. They could also do satellite-esque pricing systems where you get nickeled and dimed for every website you want. $5 a month for education websites, $3 a month for social media, etc.  
$C: It reverses some dumb rules implemented in 2012 or so. Lots and lots of low-information idiots (I.e., your average Redditor) think this will end the internet forever.

This is despite the internet working just fine before 2012.
$C: Lol a Vice article. Might as well be giving us an article from the DNC.
$C: GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
$C: same
$C: Not yet.
$C: I love democracy.
$C: if you noted on the Rep who voted for net neutrality, they are in highly congested districts.

My bs meter suspected that they collaborated with the GOP and going to kill it either by the president or the house. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: So leave? If you're tired of Reddit's shit then just don't get on here.
$C: Unfortunately the last one. 

Hell half the people in this thread have some misconceptions on who's doing the what. 
$C: You mean a act? Not really kabuki-ish.
$C: Not passing the house doesn't make it useless. Even if it passed the House and Senate unanimously, it wouldn't be permanent. Every little bit of educating the public, and impressing on those in power that this is important to us, helps in the next fight.
$C: And here we are.
$C: No, he'll just veto it.
$C: Those are eight years this country wishes it could get back. Obama, what an absolute failure.
$C: Hey, SendLewds, just a quick heads-up:  
**wierd** is actually spelled **weird**. You can remember it by **e before i**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
$C: anyone whose not a moron supports this.
$C: Perhaps the situation is more nuanced than you are allowing for?
$C: It's going to go to the house, where it will probably die, because Republicans control it by a much wider margin. But there's a small chance that the popularity of net neutrality \(huge majorities of both parties support it when they're explained what it actually is\) will force people to vote for it out of fear it'll hurt their re\-election chances. But probably not; the main hope is that it will put Republicans on the record voting against an extremely popular stance and hurt their chances in November. If enough of them lose then, the Democrats retake the house and pass it.

At this point, the majority of GOP people that are against net neutrality only hate it because they know that liberals like it. There is no reason to support Ajit Pai unless you're a comcast exec.
$C: It means millennials can jerk off over their "victory" for a couple weeks.
$C: I'm pro net neutrality so my response will be biased but I hear that...

1. government regulation of the internet is not ok
2. corporations should be allowed to control the internet based on bandwidth usage
3. this will open up competition
4. corporations will obviously respond to those who want net neutrality by adjusting
$C: Yes because granting the government more power in your life is a republican ideal? You claim to be a hardcore republican but you aren't a conservative 
$C: Lmao it's true.
$C: Are you loss?
$C: >if Netflix uses a lot more bandwidth then they should pay for it

That's.... that's literally net neutrality, my dude.

Net neutrality means every bit of data is equal. 100mb of text is treated the same as 100mb of video. 

It's trying to prevent an ISP from saying that two *equal* sets of data are different prices.  
$C: Hey, Mintman2020, just a quick heads-up:  
**goverment** is actually spelled **government**. You can remember it by **n before the m**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
$C: It's weird how everybody is treating this like a simple black and white issue. Net neutrality is good, but that doesn't mean that any implementation of it is good.

 I don't think a single person that is rallying for this legislation on the internet understands the full scope of this implementation.  Every article I have read has focused only on net neutrality and why we need it, often times not even getting that part right, while ignoring trade offs and consequences this legislation has.
$C: I do think the Internet needs to be treated like a utility and my ISP needs to treat all of the traffic the same. Who’s fighting to censor content? 
$C: You're conflating routing and hosting. [Refer to this post for an in-depth overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/6nic7y/the_founder_of_reddit_explains_net_neutrality_to/dkaaet2/).
$C: >TBH I am quite conflicted on the net neutrality debate, we'd do better to get government subsidy of these monopolies out of the picture entirely.

Every person except redditors.
$C: Are you aware that net neutrality has nothing to do with content?

It's about ISPs not being allowed to limit content based on prioritization.

So without net neutrality, Comcast would be allowed to throttle bandwaidth available for Netflix, while prioritizing traffic from Hulu. 


It's about being neutral as to where the **data packets** come from. Not what's in the **data packets**.
$C: Do you know what the difference between Reddit censoring content and Comcast censoring or prioritizing content? Reddit is not the gateway to the internet. If you don’t like what Reddit is doing simply move to a different website. Without NN if Comcast or any other ISP that has a regional monopoly decides censor something or prioritize one site over everything else consumers have NO OTHER OPTION. It is mind boggling that at this point with all the readily available information you can still be so misinformed.
$C: > Are you aware of the extreme irony in Reddit fighting for the government to force ostensibly neutral content providers to not censor content while you censor more and more content with less and less reasoning as to why?

There's a huge difference between a site censoring their OWN content, and a monopoly censoring the content of an independent website/business. Nice try.
$C: Reddit is a privately owned site and does not cost you anything to use. If you have issues with how it is run, the easiest solution would be to Simply stop using it. Their obligation is to their shareholders, not to you as the end-user, it is what it is. But then you wouldn't be able to bitch and moan about it on the very website that you are so angry about, so I'm not sure what you would do with your free time at that point. 
$C: >Are you aware of the extreme irony in Reddit fighting for the government to force ostensibly neutral content providers to not censor content while you censor more and more content with less and less reasoning as to why?
>
>Why should comcast be forced to serve literal nazis with utter neutrality but you not?  Is reddit not meant to be public?  neutral?
>
>TBH I am quite conflicted on the net neutrality debate, we'd do better to get government subsidy of these monopolies out of the picture entirely.

Are you aware that there's a difference between the government and a website? If not, check out the first amendment (and the rest of the Constitution, for that matter).


For example, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." More specifically, the **government** cannot, among other things, financially support one religion over others or declare a national religion. On the other hand, a **citizen** is allowed to tithe at church every Sunday and wear a shirt saying "Jesus is the Son of God."


Get it?


If not, here's another example from the Fiest Amendment, but section 1 this time. I can freely tell you to shut the fuck up. However, if Congress passes a law requiring you to shut the fuck up, it must adhere to a strict set of rules. Otherwise, it's unconstitutional.


The issue of net neutrality is much more complicated than these issues, but baby steps first. Go do some homework and research: Come back with five differences between citizens and the government, from a Constitutional standpoint. Then, once I see you've grasped that concept, we'll move on to lesson two.


Extra Credit: Write an essay summarizing why you shouldn't preach legal opinions when you don't understand the underlying legal issues.
$C: Reddit is free while your ISP bill is not. NN forces all ISPs to treat 1mb of data as 1mb of data despite whether the content comes from Netflix, reddit or a racist hate blog. Reddit can remove racist content as you agree to a TOS when creating your account. We've already seen ISPs crack down on users to milk them for more money. Your internet service now likely has a data cap just like you mobile cell phone. It's all about milking the user for more money. Repealing NN also allows these companies to make changes to your bill without properly notifying you of the change.

The monopolies are so engrained after decades of merger abuse that removing them will take more than a lifetime because they have to be fought at a local level across the entire US where the ISPs can dump cash into a politician for much cheaper than in DC. 
$C: You can go to another website by clicking a link. I can't go to another ISP without moving my life somewhere else.

**The net neutrality argument isn't that everything has a responsibility to be neutral**. It's that ISPs specifically need it because they present a unique circumstance where private, unregulated companies have monopolistic control over what has become a utility.
$C: You mean big tech companies might have invested interest in this which benefits them and not the everyday consumer??? 

I feel deceived, i tell ya!
$C: [deleted]
$C: It’s true this NN bullshit won’t stop content creators from doing their own censorship which is the biggest issue.. the way to handle annoying IsP is to break up big monopolies... this NN thing is fake news 
$C: Great comment 
$C: This is why I only tell redditors they are stupid and should die.
$C: They freak out that black people get kicked out of Starbucks for trespassing.

They ignore that a black man gets threatened and called the n-word by a horde of employees at the Cheesecake Factory for his political beliefs.

Such is the blatant, hysterical hypocrisy of the left.
$C: Careful. Pointing out anything of the sort will get you banned. Free thought creates the most hated people in the country. I think it's hilarious how politicians brand anything to be honest. If a person who has helped spend 4 trillion a year and lives their entire life is luxury far beyond what they could ever make themselves as a private citizen names something I usually just invert the words and it'd be a safe bet that's closer to the truth. Net neutrality is exactly one of those things. The more I read about how it was written up the more I feel I'm taking crazy pills looking at reddit karma seizing this topic. Just be careful before you have attack dogs brought onto you by Internet tough guys
$C: Careful folks were talking about literal Nazism here, that's the worst kind!
$C: Because telecoms and websites are regulated differently.  
$C: What content Is censored here? Serious question. 

I've definitely been censored and banned in certain subreddits but that's only due to the mods there
$C: Reddit has never been neutral. They are controlled by the left. Why do you think it’s always liberal bullshit at the front page or cuck comments at the top? Spez is a pussy. The most active dom on this shit site is constantly being brigaded and censored. Major ISPs have their monopoly again due to useful idiots. 
$C: >Are you aware of the extreme irony in Reddit fighting for the government to force ostensibly neutral content providers to not censor content while you censor more and more content with less and less reasoning as to why?

TIL that I am Reddit and have the ability to censor content. And all this time I simply thought I was a person using Reddit.
$C: misinformed
$C: That’s not irony. Reddit, like any private company has the right to say what does and does not appear on their website. Reddit isn’t restricting your rights to post whatever racist or ignorant bullshit that you want. You can do that somewhere else.

ISPs on the other hand are a utility. Most Americans don’t have a real option on who provides their internet service. ISPs shouldn’t have a right to restrict content.

It doesn’t matter what I use the bandwidth I pay for. It doesn’t cost Comcast any more if I watch a video on Comcast instead of Hulu, so why should they get to charge me more?

I don’t know how anyone with any intelligence can argue that it’s ok for an ISP to have the ability to censor content.
$C: 
>TBH I am quite conflicted on the net neutrality debate, we'd do better to get government subsidy of these monopolies out of the picture entirely.


I think it should be more like a non profit of mixed involvement, funded by tax money but independent of government and  intertwined with private influence in decision making with strict guidelines and independent oversight by at least two other entities.


It's going to become far too important in the future to leave to just government or private institutions. We need a new "internet constitution" and a governing body that fragments and regulates undue influence for  individuals and interests.



As for the comparison of Reddit to private control of the internet itself I don't think that's even the same ballpark.
$C: Reddit wants NN so they can send lobbyists and shut down websites they don't like. That's the long game here, just like the FCC polices what gets broadcast on radio and television. They want to expand this to all of the internet, I guarantee it. The goal of all the big websites with net neutrality is to be able to dictate what constitutes an "acceptable website" that will get preferential treatment from ISPs and the government. Then they simply can demand to throttle or shut down sites they deem "hateful" or they can demand that their own websites be subsidized by taxpayers, just like the BBC funds its propaganda with taxpayer dollars.

Net neutrality is entirely unneeded to keep the internet free. Restricted internet is only a problem in countries where the governmetn controls it, which is exactly what these morons want to happen with Net Neutrality.

But you can't argue with stupid people, sadly.
$C: Correct

https://youtu.be/dh8sVHb5oOA
$C: Y tho
$C: To some extent, it's simple corruption.  Also, these guys are like +500 years old, and a lot of them just aren't equipped to understand the online world, so they turn to the "experts" that lobby them.
$C: Welcome to the Republican Party!
$C: Verizon
$C: Because giving the government more power is a bad thing. 
$C: Even a large amount of "educated" redditors are incapable or unwilling to understand this issue, even though it's explained to them every six months. They made up their mind from a position of technological ignorance, based only on a mixture of partisanship and vague political theories seasoned with propaganda, and will NOT change it.

Now guess how those dinosaurs in your government are going to act.
$C: We need Chester Cheetah to allow this.
$C: You don't have a reason to oppose it except for a vague slippery-slope fallacy about how the evil government will somehow use these protections to do the exact opposite of their intention, even when there is nothing at all to suggest that is even possible. I agree the government is by no means perfect, but by refusing any consumer protection laws you are allowing yourself to be [fucked over by private corperations](https://np.reddit.com/r/KeepOurNetFree/comments/7ej1nd/fcc_unveils_its_plan_to_repeal_net_neutrality/dq5hlwd/?st=JAA62V5F&sh=45a33b81) just because of the vague fear of government oppression.
$C: It’s not like the private isp’s are suddenly being replaced by government entities. The providers proved they can’t be trusted without a few regulations, is all.

They had many years without net neutrality but they got greedy and paid for it when the government stepped in. Now they’re trying to cheat the system and they have a stooge in Ajit Pai who is all too willing to take their money and help. 
$C: Hey, TheLoneWanderer1775, just a quick heads-up:

$C: Yeah good point this corrupt government is just working to better ISP's and give them more money. Which is why we should give all the power straight to ISP's then we can cut out the middle man and make it easier for ISP's to further themselves
$C: well said. those gop who voted against their party has probably collaborated with the party so it doesnt matter.

i hope maine and alaska get a grip and vote them out if it doesnt pass in the house
$C: I swear trump will disagree!
$C: You don't understand NN.
$C: "hey, let's make a rule stating ISPs must treat all internet traffic the same to keep them from manipulating it to their own ends at the expense of the public." - lawmakers

"Sounds great!" - Democrats

"REEEEEEE!!!" - Republicans
$C: Net Neutrality has been the policy of the FCC since 2005.

The people who claim Net Neutrality started with the Title II rule in 2015 are either mistaken or deceitful.

The 2015 rule was a replacement for a previous rule that got overturned in court in 2014. That rule was a replacement for a previous rule that got overturned in court in 2010.

The 2015 rule was the first to win out in court, but it is a continuation of FCC policy from long before then. There are small gaps between overturns and rule writing, but those gaps were not long enough for ISP's to risk investing in plans that they suspected the new FCC rules would prohibit anyway.

The most profitable of abuses against net neutrality require investment and vertical integration. ISP's can invest in streaming internet content, and throttle competitor streaming services. Notice AT&T is looking to buy Time Warner. They are far from the only ISP looking to vertically integrate and abuse their market control of the gate to the internet.
$C: You say this as if the internet has been around for 100 years.  Also, Comcast wasn't controlling near all the telecommunication industry.
$C: NN was unofficial policy for the history of the Internet. It's only recently when ISPs started to test for what is acceptable that it was deemed necessary for their to be actual, enforceable laws to prevent that power creep. It's not a new invention. 
$C: The government, with Republican support, just voted to give itself more power to regulate private companies. And you’re celebrating it because MAYBE you’ll get $5 off Internet a month or something in five years, if it were to even get signed back into law, which it won’t. 
$C: Until the entire government is out of power? You better start cutting some power lines! 
$C: No the Democrats need to gtfo then we will have a good political atmosphere.
$C: Which isn’t gonna happen soon. Hope you enjoy Trump 2020 and don’t forget midterms where your pathetic blue wave dies. Dems are done being in power. They had their fun destroying this country. It’s Americans turn to fix it. Have fun bitching on reddit for the next 20 years. 
$C: No ur mom
$C: You realize the reason nothing has happen yet is because no ISP is going to change their rules when the stoplight is still on this issue, ISP won't change anything rn out of fear of being boycotted. 
$C: Because Reddit is full of idiots who get all their information from BuzzFeed and John Oliver.
$C: Yeah I find it hard to consider America much of a democracy these days :(
$C: Unfortunately, there are a lot of people who care about net neutrality, but don't care about it enough to vote for someone who doesn't pander to the far right.
$C: make it 49.

i dont trust those gop senators. they might have collaborated with the party beforehand for midterm election.
$C: r/apieceajit
$C: You should look up Andrew Klavan, he has an incredible lecture recently at a university talking about how lucky we are in this society. It's part of human nature to be challenged and since we've moved so many life and death challenges from our daily existence we are still using those portions of our brains for more and more mundane things. This is why so many people are becoming completely unhinged at the slightest political differences or difficulties. Politics and the state have become their only reason to exist. 1984 describes this type of person very well. 
$C: So you think that the party that constantly votes anti-consumer, suddenly changed their opinion and tried to protect the consumers by voting no this time?  
  
BTW, love how T_D was pro-NN until Donny's appointee moved to get rid of it.
$C: As opposed to leaving everything in the hands of unelected and unaccountable corporations
$C: They can't tell the difference between freedom and tyranny so bad, that they would happily be in a gulag if they were told it was for their own safety.
$C: Let's everyone know that every single person who voted against this was a Republican and 49 Democrats and 3 Republicans voted for it.

Gives you an idea of what party not to vote for in the next election.
$C: Political parties are an inevitability of any democratic system. It's simply not feasible to expect otherwise.

That being said, the way that they run in America is abysmal. You guys need massive electoral reform.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Why is this being downvoted
$C: That’s homophobic. 

You’re insinuating a guy getting it up the ass is an insult. 
$C: xdddd
$C: That’s exactly why we have the mess with ISPs we have.   Local governments backing monopolies.
$C: Vote Democrat.
$C: Get people to stop voting for republicans.
$C: It's not even over yet.

It's still has to go through both the house, and the Whitehouse. 

There is no way NN is going to survive this.

That's some extremely wishful thinking
$C: As TickleMonster said, Net Neutrality hasn't ended yet. The decision to remove the net neutrality rule goes into effect in June. So, any anecdotal speed increases you have seen are likely unrelated.

Google Fiber has been struggling against state policies that force Google to pay technicians for every existing telecommunication company to adjust the wires on the telephone poles before Google can touch it. The ISP's have rigged the system to raise the cost for new comers. States that try to fix these problems get lawsuits against them. This has nothing to do with Net Neutrality. I'm sure if you ask google, the rules had nothing to do with their decisions.

My main concern is abuse of vertical market integration. AT&T is trying to buy Time Warner. ISP's are moving into the content streaming business. They don't have to compete on a level playing field in this industry. They already have state law rigged to prevent new comers like google. They can throttle their streaming content competitors so that they don't have to compete with netflix.

Netflix and Disney may be able to pay these companies extra to stop being throttled, but smaller websites will not. ISP's, under poorly made state policies from decades ago \(and due to the high cost of buying access to land and laying copper\), already have local monopolies. I don't want the ISP's to be able to abuse their ISP market control to block competition in the far more competitive internet content market. I could literally start my own website for a web based business for a few hundred dollars. The cost barrier to entry in web content is incredibly low. Why let ISP's cheat in the web content market by leveraging their anti\-competitive ISP market position to block and throttle their competitors?
$C: The fact that major companies are *supporting* net neutrality is also quite telling. Why would you be so supportive of something that hinders your business model? Always be skeptical of companies who want more regulation. Chances are it is because they stand to benefit, as you have described.
$C: (*Hey the repeal hasn't actually taken effect yet BECAUSE it was blocked by Congress, so your $0.02 just got dropped in the wrong jar*)

Just so you know. Which you don't seem to. 
$C: if you haven't blocked replies by now, i'd like to say thanks for thinking critically. I know you know you may not be right, but nobody should blindly accept this as pure truth just because reddit told us it was.

i get this as someone who doesn't like being told what to think, and seeing how poorly people try to persuade others to their side of the argument, it's really hard to take a side on this. I'm a trial and error kind of person, but i don't know that i would want to give ISPs the opportunity to screw me over.

this year i was able to upgrade from 60mbps to 100mbps idk what caused it but it was right around the whole nn repeal announcement that the cable company actually implemented this. it makes me wonder if it was a scheme to convince people to keep it repealed or a gesture to show appreciation for uplifting the shackles.

one thing i can say... if you push too many people to think one way, you're going to influence an eruption of pushback, there's a large popularity of non\-conformity which will always play devils advocate and research why what you're being told to believe is wrong. AND THATS GREAT we need people like that. if for nothing else to be a part of the cultures checks and balances so nobody goes too far with their bs.

i believe we'll eventually get this right.
$C: > I understand very little about the issue

Despite the length of what you wrote, this much is evident.

The rules have not been repealed. When they have been, it will be legal for ISPs to charge you more the keep the speed that you have. And charge you more if you'd like to be able to visit Google. Enjoy streaming video? For only $50 a month extra, be able to access Netflix at all.

Like to be able to use a VPN? Why not buy our Security Conscious package? For only $100 a month, we won't block VPN traffic. Or, for just $50 a month, use our own branded VPN (some ts&cs may apply).

Like jerking off? Access to Pornhub and Redtube is free with the AdultSurf Plus package, a steal at only $60 a month extra.

On mobile? Snapchat and Facetime aren't available on your plan, why not upgrade to SocialMonster? For just $20 a month extra, get Twitter for free!

All of the above scenarios will become legal as soon as NN is actually repealed. Good thing ISPs aren't greedy, eh? 
$C: To respond to your first point, you obviously know the nature of the Internet. There isn't a set amount of data to stream but there is a set *rate* that can be streamed at any one time. The big telecom companies got somewhere between 200 billion and 400 billion in tax breaks because they promised to build fiber optic networks that would massively increase this rate and make it so that no one would need to be limited to a data limit. Unfortunately, most of that fiber was never built, and it's why Google Fiber was such a big deal when it was still expanding. So people feel like they've already paid for it because otherwise there would have been more money out into their state through taxes. 

I don't know much about why Google Fiber stopped expanding but I remember hearing that it had more to do with being forced to comply to some strange requirements to install Fiber in the cities they were in. I'll look into it. 

And like the other commenter said, NN is still in effect so we can't know what the ramifications will be yet. Some of us aren't lucky enough to have a choice between two providers for internet (I only have one) so yes my problem may lie with the oligarchies/monopolies causing this, but NN is the only thing that can provide immediate relief and that I have control over. 
$C: >Third, if censorship is your concern because NN is no longer governing which content can be viewed or not, use a different DNS and a VPN.

Fucking ridiculous. You think the average person knows how to use a VPN or change DNS? Shill harder.

edit: Do people not get this? Without NN let's say Comcast blocks Netflix to give their competitor Hulu an advantage. What free VPN could people use that uses as much data as video streaming? Also Netflix blocked almost all VPNs from being used. What pain in the ass. Why do they need the right to do this?
$C: Commenting so that I can research these points later.

This is a good breakdown of some of the concerns I think are valid in regards to net neutrality.

[Here's](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dYVgIGL1E34) an interesting video on the subject for you incase you haven't seen it already. 
$C: Stop being modest about the just your two cents.  You actually know what you are saying and now watch how the morons who couldn't build a modem demand high speed internet be a right.  haha  The reason we can have this argument is the same reason why you shouldn't start hamstringing the operations of the thing you clearly seem to love.  sheep will be sheep.
$C: Here's my 0.02 cents. America has freedom of speech and religion. We have the freedom of information act as well. The internet since its conception has evermore become the defacto means of sharing information and ideas. In my view you should NEVER have to use a workaround to excercise your constitutional rights i.e. having to use a VPN to browse the world wide web because so many results are censored. It is infringement on freedom of speech because someone out there is dictating what you see and how, forcing you to express yourself on the limited number of platforms you can access.

You say that the problem lies with oligoploies, which is a fair statement, but saying that paying extra for services at your providers discretion is reasonable is incredibly contradictive.

Another user commented that we should regulate the internet as a utility, which I wholly agree with. It solves both problems, in effect you would pay for what you use and be free to use whichever site/service YOU want, not what companies decide is best for you. NN is a huge step in the right direction and hopefully we can win this fight. The internet is arguably one of mankind's greatest achievements, in history books technological revolutions are based upon the basic principle of sharing new information and ideas. The internet is the pen ultimate means of sharing ideas, information, goods, and services. We should fiercely defend it for that reason alone.
$C: You sure write a lot about a topic you claim, and demonstrate, not to know much about. Why exactly do you believe repealing NN would generate ISP competition?

Streaming services already pay ISPs to serve their data, and you pay to receive it. You're comment about "if you know how the internet works" would be hillarious if you weren't trying to put completely false and misleading information out there. I'd suggest not talking about subjects you have very little understanding of, but that seems to be a t_d user specialization. 

I'd love to take your comment apart but I'm on a phone, and you don't seem like the type that believes anything other than what Hannity and Rush feed you.

$C: Shut the fuck up. You're not playing devils advocate, you're a shill.
$C: fuck off shill
$C: A bit of latency in text? No issue, humans can't even detect it. A bit of latency in video? Tons of player issues.

But dumbasses here are celebrating destruction of QoS.
$C: Facts and logic have no place here. 
$C: Providers started slowing down Netflix.. because they wanted their own tv services used instead. Some also tried to get Netflix to pay more to get faster speed... thus the price would come up for us. 

Pretty much its the beginning of a mess. Specially sense we are controlled by such a small list of companies now. In the end these companies can start slowing content or even blocking content.. such as Netflix because they want you to use Hulu. That would be only the beginning.. 
$C: Netflix and Youtube got faster.
$C: Democrats are generally on the side of the people and free information while republicans are generally on the side of big business.
$C: >making sure the feds can't do shit about each states nn

Pretty sure that would take a constitutional amendment.  A bunch of NN laws governing something that is national (really global, but national is more applicable here) in scope is exactly what the Federal government is for and would be one of the few proper uses of the commerce clause.

I think a decent parallel would be if every state started to pass rules on commercial trucking.  Sure, big trucking companies could absorb the costs of having lawyers to come up with a plan and have people implement it, but smaller ones would be crying out to the Feds to either standardize things or remove the patchwork of laws.

(Insert obligatory 'the internet is not a big truck' reference here)


$C: You realize most of those bots were on places like r/PoliticalHumor and were not posting pro-trump content.  
$C: The Russian bots got banned as they were found...
$C: I litteraly can't think of a more Anti-Trump site  than Reddit. 

Have you seen r/politics? That's what botting looks like. Half the people in there have a a different variations of the same name, they don't even try to hide it.

$C: there were about 300 russian influence bots on reddit

all were banned

Russia doesnt manipulate reddit, george soros and far left power tripper mods do

Almost every post on the front page is either some sappy sweet white guilt post or obvious political agenda pushing
$C: [deleted]
$C: According to the FEC Correct the record spent at least a quarter million dollars on Reddit, but they were not ad buys.... Hmmmm....
$C: Reddit didn't decide the election. Get your head out of your ass.
$C: Russian bots are fake news
$C: Wonder why a bunch of front page posts have to do with impeaching Trump 🤔
$C: he'll kill 23 and maim one. 
$C: He's checking it twice...
$C: > . She's been a good politician for Maine for a while, but lately has been pandering too hard to her party. Glad she crossed the aisle for this.

she didnt. she collaborated with her party on the betsy devos vote. she probably did the same thing here. 

dont give any GOP an inch or else they take a mile.
$C: Because it's not actually in charge? This simply means that internet service providers can't discriminate content and police everything that they don't like or charge the consumer and the websites an extra over it.
$C: Down vote all you want. Keep up the good fight for more government control. 
$C: Because everything has been backwards for awhile now, unfortunately.
$C: hey both the answers you got were the two extreme political sides. I'm somebody who actually studied networking infrastructure.

basically when you pay your internet bill, you pay a certain price for a certain speed. with net neutrality, you are paying for data. it doesn't matter if that data is youtube or blogspot or xhamster. conversely, on the server side, they are all paying similar rates for whatever bandwidth they need to serve their customers. basically the internet is being treated as water or electricity is.

basically how much for or against you are is based on how libertarian you are. the big worry for those guys is that the government is going to kill the smaller companies by forcing them to play on the same scale as the big companies. as well, as with any government regulations there's fear of tainting the free market.

 i support net neutrality in spite of that because I worry more about big powerful companies killing online entrepreneurs by giving favorable prices to businesses partners. it also opens up the opportunity for powerful people to control what information we can access. 

it's also worth mentioning that hardcore trump weirdos are vehemently opposed to net neutrality because trump hired a guy who is opposed to it. 
$C: People with no concept of how to run a business want the government to have more power in the future over what goes on in the internet because they think that evil capitalists will take away their netflix. 
$C: John Oliver has two breakdowns of it, here is one of them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92vuuZt7wak
$C: > It essentially forces your fat neighbor who downloads 2TB a day of zoophilia to be treated the same as your grandma who checks her email once a week.

it does not do that 
$C: Yeah and those crafty child labour laws and food safety regulations and OSHA really just keep taking it away from our friendly neighborhood corporations.
$C: If you think Net Neutrality is the government "regulating the internet" you are horribly malinformed.  Net Neutrality is making it such that cable companies can't regulate the internet.

It means Comcast can't regulate the internet.

Without net neutrality the net won't stay 'Free' or 'neutral'
$C: Wouldn't hailing corporate be the exact opposite of this?
$C: Also, pretend, reddit, that you are neutral 
$C: BAHAHAH, yeah, because voting to legislation that supports small businesses against a global monopoly is totally hail corporate. 
$C: >tyrannical government

Oh, come off it. You wouldn't know tyranny if it pissed on your head.
$C: its a shame you cant see Trump is making life better for everyone

$C: It’s a weird world we live in where government control is viewed as freedom. I’ve used the net for over 20 years both professionally and personally without neutrality laws and never even noticed they were a thing until liberals starting politicking about their abolition.
$C: Its about regulating what the huge ass corporations can do with the internet so that they can't dictate how internet os provided. Does this make sense? It really isn't that hard to grasp that the telecom companies having free reign to do whatever they want with the internet is bad, right? I mean, this is the biggest source of freedom and American values in the world, correct? Why would we want to protect it?
$C: > We should have the government tell us what kind of cars we get to drive and how fast


Well, uhm, if you want to use a government owned street, there are minimum requirements for vehicles, and definitely posted speed limits. I'm kinda appreciative that when I'm on the highway I know I won't round a corner in to a dirt bike or golf cart going 15 MPH, that one seems to be working out well. 
$C: > We should have the government tell us what kind of cars we get to drive and how fast, which restaurants we should eat at and even what to eat, maybe they could tell us what to wear 

you do realize those are already happening right? Motor regulations and speed limits are a thing, Health Code and the FDA is a thing. and public indecency laws are a thing
$C: Reese's Pumkin Pie!
$C: It at the very least sets a precedent to protect the traffic going internationally from the same mafia shakedown type of tactic that American residential ISPs have been doing. 

So regardless if your ISP is demanding protection money from the services you utilize on the internet, the companies that own the international trunks coming out of the USA aren't likely to be allowed to fuck with the data either.
$C: [deleted]
$C: A shit pie*
$C: Tammy from Rick and Morty.
$C: What?
$C: IKR.
$C: Since our government is a shitshow and gave us shit choices between two shit people, most americans vote against one piece of shit, not for another piece of shit.

The piece of shit that won didn't get voted FOR by the vast majority. The other piece of shit was voted against just slightly more.
$C: Shit, I can't believe how plausible this actually sounds. Our government is a clusterfuck headed by lemmings trailing eachother to their doom.
$C: Funny we didn’t need it before it existed though 
$C: Even when a politician knows he/she will lose, they must still vote for the lobbyist's interests or risk being outed and blacklisted as someone who can't be trusted to follow through on bribes.
$C: uhhhhhhhhhhhhh it has the word *neutrality* in it, it must be good!!!!1
$C: Its not important and means nothing
$C: Net neutrality basically means that companies can’t screw with your internet speed. The reason it’s so important is because they can do it with certain sites in particular. Take Comcast for example. They have their own streaming service, so it would be in their interest to interfere with Netflix’s speeds. So if a site isn’t favored by a certain provider, they would have he power to pretty much crush their business. Net neutrality says they can’t do that. The overall goal is to prevent the few companies from making the internet into a monopoly, and to keep it free and easy to use for everyone.
$C: This is just about forcing votes ahead of the mid term elections so they can be cited in campaign ads.
$C: Happy false internet  confectionary treat day

$C: Nothing until it passes house. 
$C: You are stuck with them either way, ISPs are not a free market
$C: It's literally just all the Republicans, other than Collins, Kennedy, and Murkowski.
$C: Other than Susan Collins, John Kennedy, and Lisa Murkowski, all Republicans voted against and all Democrats voted for.
$C: They're republican.
$C: If so, it would be a different outcome. 
$C: It still has to go through the house and through the president i think
$C: Other than Susan Collins, John Kennedy, and Lisa Murkowski, all Republicans voted against and all Democrats voted for.
$C: That means more government so yeah 
$C: Other than Susan Collins, John Kennedy, and Lisa Murkowski, all Republicans voted against and all Democrats voted for.
$C: Believe he's still in the hospital.
$C: Republicans' "official" stance is less government, more trust in people. Their shtick has been (since the party shift a long time ago) that more government regulations = bad. To a Republican eye, the government enforcing neutrality is inherently bad simply because the government is enforcing it.

They spin it as "cramping the free market" and "infringing on the rights of entrepeneurs" without acknowledging that those entrepeneurs have already shown themselves more than willing to screw over the common person to get more money. Republican faith in the goodness of humanity is childish and idealistic at best. Also, due to the way the Internet is set up, ISPs already really aren't a free market anyway. There's like 3 companies and they don't serve all areas, so most people at MOST have the choice between two. 

Meanwhile the Democratic stance is that safeguarding the common people is worth the extra effort of government enforcement. This is why they tend to be liberal, tend to fight for underdogs, and are on the side of net neutrality
$C: All Republicans except for majkowski, collins, and kennedy.
$C: In the hospital.
$C: No it didn't. 
$C: Three Republicans did, that's the only reason it passed.

Also as to why 47 Republicans voted against it when 86% of Americans want it: they don't care what their people want. Simple as that.
$C: Boiling the frog.

The second net neutrality died, if every company rushed to do what they had the right to do it would have caused even more outrage and in the long run may have cost them their opportunity.

If net neutrality stays dead, they'll ease into new territory slowly. They'll test the waters first.

$C: it's so incredibly difficult to start up an internet company it's already basically not a free market. Most areas have either 1 or 2 options available to them and the overhead to start up is *incredibly* high. Protecting the consumer is far, far more important.

$C: It's was almost strictly along party lines.  And with McCain out, the Democrats didn't need much.
$C: >Why is this such a partisan issue?

I have $ome idea...
$C: House has more Republicans.
$C: Republican stance is laws are bad and the government should be as hands off as humanly possible. They think that somehow despite years of proof corporations somehow will have consciences and not screw over common man... Which basically never happens. It's a cute little naiive view that gets them lots of support from corporations and thus big paychecks.
$C: Not even close. This still has to pass house and get a presidential signature. It's a good step, though.
$C: Three Republicans broke party lines to vote for. We only needed one, so technically all three of them were the deciding vote.
$C: Because corporations have proven time and time again that they cannot be trusted to play fair without government regulation.
$C: Their deal is the Republican stance: government is bad and laws are bad, so less laws = good

Plus, y'know, being bought off bUT
$C: All 47 were republicans. Only 3 Republicans broke the party line to vote in favor.
$C: Technically net neutrality is still dead u til the full process is followed, however the Senate vote will make companies very wary of using their newfound power for fear of bringing down huge backlash.

$C: That might be the case if starting up a new ISP was easy and cheap, but it's neither. Investors won't touch ISPs because they take years and years to see returns, buying space on someone else's lines is expensive and laying your own line is even more so, and already-established ISPs aren't above playing dirty to crush competition early.
$C: Yes, because we all know how many new telcos are just chomping at the bit to set up shop in Cougar Cooch, South Dakota where there's only one ISP available, don't we?

$C: Speaking of Texas, did y'all know that the phrase "what's up, doc?" said by Bugs Bunny originated from Tex Avery's time spent growing up in Dallas?
$C: Bitch
$C: Ah yes it's so sad that the ISPs won't get the power to censor and limit the internet, I really wish the government did a free-for-all where every corporation fucks the consumer over to get more money and power ):
$C: So you don't trust the state, but trust that corporations will treat you fairly?
$C: An underinformed reeeeeeee.  Unique.
$C: Going to be honest, if that's really your your mindset on people in Alabama, you're not going to make many friends, which could improve your experience.

IDK what part of Alabama you live in, but Auburn, Bham, Huntsville, Tuscaloosa, all have their stereotypical parts for sure, but are generally far from the line of thinking you feel they have.
$C: vote in the midterm then move out.
$C: Don't come to Georgia it ain't much better, but if you're coming round to Columbus en route north pick me up. 
$C: I didn’t know that hitler was president.
$C: Worst leader in history of humanity denuclearized Korean peninsula? Your Trump derangement syndrome is showing.
$C: >Worst leader in the history of humanity

So, Donald Trump is worse than Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Pol Pot, King Leopold II of Belgium, Vladimir Lenin, Mao Zedong, Hugo Chavez, Tiberius, Fidel Castro, Kim Jong Un, Bashar al-Assad, Attila the Hun, and Genghis Khan. **Combined.** Are you fucking retarded?
$C: Obama cant veto shit hes no longer a leader of anything, its even questionable if he ever was
$C: You know what? Fuck you dude. I'm a conservative and this pisses me off.
$C: Go back to sucking off Ajit and Trump
$C: Rand Paul loves free markets. Why would he vote for more regulation on the internet as a libertarian?
$C: If you think Net Neutrality = "fair access to the internet", you've been duped.

Either way the common man gets screwed.
$C: I'm a libertarian leaning person, though I will be open minded towards other ways when it makes sense.

I see why a libertarian type like Rand Paul would vote against... Because "get government out of it. Let the free market do its job and give the people the best product and price."

Unfortunately, to my limited knowledge and generalizing, that is not how most local areas are. Most areas have 1 high-speed ISP option. The local government probably gave them some incentive to set up shop in their town... And for a second person to come into town, they're not given the same incentive so its harder on them... And then they need to split their profits with the established ISP. 

If anything, its more crony capitalism a smarter libertarian should see through, and fight it any way they can, because it gives the free market a bad name.
$C: But the hyper corporations agree with you, they don't want to be regulated as title II companies.
$C: How about starting by forming some better opinions?
$C: r/circlejerk
$C: This is actually pretty funny imo
$C: Putting the internet under the FCC's 1936 Title II Broadcast License is the real issue, same as TV and Radio.

People that are for NN have no fucking clue.
$C:  She doesn't.

She pays for the speed, not content.  For emails, dial-up is likely enough, which is much cheaper.  If she chooses to spend more,  that's on her. 
$C: I'm a young person. My parents and I pay for much different plans. Theirs is significantly cheaper and slower. What you want already exists and will with or without NN. Not sure where NN comes in.
$C: What does this have to so with net neutrality?

What does my internet provider have to do with the 4k tentacle porn i download, do you think it cost them more money to serve me?
$C: > Why should my mom, who uses the internet for email every other day or so, have to pay the same for internet as somebody who is playing Fortnite, streaming music, downloading 4k 3d porn and streaming The Office on Netflix for background noise?

She doesn't have to. There are slow speed internet packages available, right now. She could do that. The legislation isn't about your ability to pay for more or less bandwidth. It's about whether or not an ISP can throttle bandwidth to certain sites. 

Better question is, why are you going to bat for a global monopoly? 
$C: Because the alternative is handing too much power to the carriers to shut out competition and control what people can see. 


The current mechanisms of speed tires and data quotas do however provide a reasonable degree of fairness in pricing
$C: It isn't the price per se, it's the speed.

Extreme example?

Imagine your cable provider choosing to throttle your grandma's email provided by ProviderA.  Reason: Provider B paid them money to favor them and hurt their competition. Now the only way grandma still gets fast email is by switching to Provider B, who incidentally, charges her a monthly fee.


$C: I mean, if her data plan has caps then she wouldn't. also if she has a plan for slower internet speed
$C: She doesn't. Assuming you don't have a good internet plan.
$C: It’s a flat rate to enter Disney land regardless of how many rides you go in.

(I would guess because the actual cost to send data in a per packet basis is a pittance compared to the cost required to build the infrastructure)

Edit: just to piss off both sides - I am pro net neutrality, but also very much against this bill because I don’t think it actually accomplishes that.
$C: She shouldn't. But most of this website wants her to continue subsidizing them. 
$C: Please read up on what net neutrality is before you spout off shit like this.
$C: Why should my wife, who doesn’t like roller coasters , have to pay the same admission to get into six flags as someone who rides everything? 
$C: > did the absence of net neutrality even do? 

It hasn't been dissolved yet. We haven't experienced the absence of it since it was enacted.

And even though it still hasn't been dissolved, companies are already rolling out the unethical systems its supposed to protect us from. They can do it because while NN is still technically law and in effect - they haven't enforced any of the rules since the FCC was captured.

$C: It did exactly nothing. 
$C: We haven't lost net neutrality yet, but we likely will soon.

And underestimated part of the win here is what a growing segment of the public supporting net neutrality does. It sends a signal to politicians that supporting net neutrality will get them more votes. And it sends a signal to big ISPs that even if they're soon not legally bound to net neutrality, it's what we expect of them. They'll face a backlash if they break net neutrality, and will know that if they spend millions on systems to fuck with our traffic, once the current Congress, President, and FCC are out of power, they won't legally be able to use it anyway.
$C: [He looks like a nice guy to play Nerf with and fidget our spinners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd7S4ZGGgXY)  /s
$C: We're near doing it okay does that work
$C: Every single Republican except Collins, Murkowski, and Kennedy.
$C: read the post
$C: But who else is gonna dress up like santa and regale the masses with nerf guns and a false sense of security
$C: He's in his office, but they do not grant him the rank of "master".
$C: Lol, do you even know what freedom of speech is?
$C: No law is permanent so in theory even in a best-cased scenario for this situation, in the future someone can still push for NN to be repealed. However, unless the polical climate vastly changes, it's unlikely any repeal with gain traction. Again, this is assuming best-case scenario in which this bill goes through. 
$C: The FCC has been protecting net neutrality for almost a decade and a half. 

The internet changed a lot since then. The FCC lost a lot of lawsuits, and has had to continuously update the means by which they protect net neutrality. The 2015 rule was put into place because the previous rule protecting net neutrality had been overturned in court. The overturned rule was put into place because the rule before that had been overturned in court. you get the idea.

The 2015 rule was upheld by the courts. 

Ajit Pai has been repeatedly claiming the Net Neutrality started in 2015. This claim is incredibly misleading. The FCC has been protecting net neutrality since 2005. A lot of their previous rules protecting net neutrality were overturned, forcing rule changes to be made to maintain the status quo of Net Neutrality.
$C: Net neutrality also allows the internet marketplace or E-commerce to remain free of outside influence, keeping it a nearly pure free market. Now without NN, ISPs are allowed to fiddle with your internet speeds whenever they feel like it. 

Free markets are important, a rule stating all traffic must be treated equally keeps them free from outside influence, without the rule influencing the market itself. Yet somehow, ppl have been foolishly lead to believe this is just more Big Gubment with their unnecessary red tape blah blah....
$C: He can veto it sadly, yes.

Assuming this even passes the House, which is unlikely.
$C: Badger your house representatives, especially if they're republican. They vote on it next.
$C: The ISP market isn't a free market. Try to start your own ISP. The government owns the telephone poles that you have to connect your copper to \(or the land you run your copper under\). You have to pay all the telecom companies to send technicians out to make sure you don't screw their stuff up \(cause they bought the state politicians who made the rules\). 

Net Neutrality is a small, narrowly scoped federal rule that prevents ISP's from abusing their state government granted monopolies to abuse their market position to gain an upper hand in the far more competitive internet content market.
$C: Trump doesn't have any say in this bill. They don't need his signature
$C: It’s the same concept as legalizing pot. If it fails, the vote will keep happening until it passes. 
$C: The USA didn't have it until 2012. The internet was the same back then. Do some research, please.
$C: It won’t even make it out of The House, bro.
$C: Yes handing over the keys to companies like Comcast must be the answer. What could go wrong? 
$C: All 47 against were republican. Majkowski, Collins, and Kennedy were the only Republicans not to vote against.
$C: Hey, gavuga3, just a quick heads-up:  
**happend** is actually spelled **happened**. You can remember it by **ends with -ened**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
$C: Try doing a bit more reading, then.
$C: Everyone agrees with cute dogs and cats. Only brainlets and Canadians think a federal mandate on the internet is going to somehow benefit the consumer. 
$C: the rule change ending net neutrality doesn't go into effect until next month, and it will be a while longer before the ISP's change their policies and investments.

Net neutrality hasn't gone away yet, and this won't stop it from going away next month. The house isn't going to even vote on the senate's bill
$C: This is an attempt to stop it from going away.
$C: The ISP doesn't have to give *websites* the same bandwidth, it has to give *consumers* the same bandwidth. If you have one GB/s and you go to obscurewebsite.com, assuming that it's the only thing your using the internet for, you will get one GB/s. The websites with more traffic get more bandwidth because of this.
$C: Worst case scenario, [this](https://imgur.com/a/aN5bSmT) happens. If it does happen, it will happen slowly, over the course of years, if not decades.

Realistically, internet companies would be able to charge services such as Netflix money for having high speed access to consumers. It has happened before. Verizon tried pulling [this](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/186576-verizon-caught-throttling-netflix-traffic-even-after-its-pays-for-more-bandwidth) shit in 2014, before Obama signed the Net Neutrality act. Higher costs for Netflix means that its profits are down, and the way for it to recuperate those profits are to charge its customers (you) more money. 

Another point for NN is that isp competition is non-existent. These companies are like cartels, they stay out of each others way to maximize profits. You can probably see this in your own home. How many isps are available to choose from in your area? 1? 2 if your lucky. This low competition allows isps to charge however much they want, and while NN doesn’t fix that, it does demonstrate how untrustworthy isps are.

In theory, the removal of NN would allow companies to properly set aside bandwidth that accommodates all websites, according to each sites usage. But after years of dealing with the likes of Comcast, nobody trusts isps to do the right thing. This isn’t a law that encourages socialism, that many people would have you believe. Its a law that enacts consumer protections. 

Also I’d like to thank you for being respectful and reasonable in saying that you are skeptical about NN.
$C: Bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that can be sent over the network.  If obscurewebsite.com is not using it then it is available to other services that arent being artificially restricted.
$C: Kinda wrong. People pay for an internet speed. Net neutrality prevents companies from charging extra for access to sites or throttling the traffic of those sites. It basically prevents isp's from dictating how you use the internet you already paid for. Imagine a 5 dollar social media package, or 10 dollar movie streaming package while still paying for your Netflix subscription.

$C: > Putting the internet under government control will hinder the free market.

The free market is currently an anti-consumerist country wide monopoly, so... good. 

Imagine if water and fire departments were for profit businesses. Oh wait no, we don't have to, because every country that ever had those got rid of that idea quickly. 
$C:  Until ISP don't have monopolies in areas, yes this is needed. The majority of the country doesn't have the option to choose another cable provider, so free market doesn't work when THERE IS NO COMPETITION. Pile on lobbying and it won't allow any others to jump in. They already have the infrastructure and they keep anyone else from being able to even take a piece of the market, the barrier to entry for a new isp is too high. 

Do you think any other phone service provider can just start selling cell phones with no towers around the country?

As far as trust, I'd take the government over trusting corporations with my data just the same. Sorry but in this situation, there is no logical reason to give the most hated companies in the world, more power to do as they please. This way, they are actually held accountable. Large majority of the population agrees. 
$C:  You want to actually know what'll fuck you Americans? the MONOPOLIES that ISPs have created in areas.for someone who supposedly loves the free market you sure want to fuck it over.
$C: Corporations are way scarier than the government. Go to the donald ya shill.
$C: [Here's a list of all the times ISPs have tried to violate net neutrality.](https://np.reddit.com/r/KeepOurNetFree/comments/7ej1nd/fcc_unveils_its_plan_to_repeal_net_neutrality/dq5hlwd/?sh=45a33b81&st=JAA62V5F). It's extremely naiive to think that we'll be fine without it in place.
$C: If you look into this more you'll find it did exist before then, but was handled on a case by case basis. The net neutrality guidelines are a much more long-term solution for a number of ISP problems.
$C: Try 1991 (start of the Commercial Internet Exchange) or earlier, depending on how you define it. You've been mislead (or are attempting to mislead others).
$C: Net Neutrality has been an important piece of legislation and debate since at LEAST 2006, that's when my fucking high school class had a debate about it. 
$C: The participating Americans did this. Left or right, the citizens spoke and we should all take pride in the fact that we made a big initial step in protecting our freedoms
$C: [deleted]
$C: First of all, who says everyone here loves Trump? Second, this is a bi-partisan issue. People on both ends of the political climate don't like this. Third, Reddit blew up in retaliation to this. And was a huge part of rallying people against Ajit Pai and his corporate cock-eating. Lastly, I'm sick and tired of you people whining because your candidate didn't win. Get over it. The faster we move on from stupid shit like this, the faster we can start coming to an agreement on issues like this one. Instead of making everything about your respective party.
$C: >Left leaning progressives did this

$C: Sorry we already had our millenium quota on "Breaking monopolies in a specific field"


$C: It’s a good thing...
$C: So, the first amendment doesn’t apply when it hurts someone’s feelings?  
And I do believe the Constitution starts with “We the People,” so if reddit is with the people, then the first amendment should be upheld. 
$C: I've never been to the donald, but everyone deserves to have a place to voice their opinion, even if it is into an echo chamber. The problem is that angry opinions like yours are just as bad as theirs and only gives them more fuel to continue their trolling.
$C: Even if you don’t the admins care about freedom of speech. Bet your tune would change if people were lobbying to have LSC removed or anything of that ilk. 
$C: fuck off retard this is totally irrelevant
$C: Wow. How very authoritarian of you. While you're at it, why don't you wire-tap and monitor their homes to stop them from thinking or speaking politically right-sided thoughts? 

That's not why we're here anyway, crusader. Take a load off.
$C: Found the nazi.
$C: Are you American? Post was made around 8:30 EST, i wouldn't call that "so late"
$C: Title II is a tad bit problematic and should be revisted in the future due to the huge capital required to start up an ISP and the effect it holds over telecoms in general as far as how it treats large and small companies similarly. However, removing it doesn't mean Comcast, Verizon, and TWC will magically play nice and stop being mega-monopolies either. Meanwhile you also gut a bunch of consumer protections in place just to place faith in what the telecoms pinky swear they will or will not do without NN.
$C: >durrr politicians never get anything worthwhile done, look how enlightened I am!

$C: question, what is r/the_Brendan and r/guro ? 
$C: Lol no one's going to jail over net neutrality 
$C: With all the information that’s available on NN you have to be purposefully dense to be so wrong about the topic
$C: This is what weaponized stupidity looks like
$C: Holy false dichotomy batman!
$C: Europe?
$C: >net neutrality is terrible for the US and businesses.

"net neutrality" as a concept is good.  "Net Neutrality" as a hashtag and a buzzword is not.

Most of the internet argues "net neutrality" when defending "Net Neutrality" when in fact the two conflict in principle
$C: Funny how if this was relevant at all, you'd realize the admins being forced to leave the_donald alone is the same as the isp's being forced to leave internet speeds alone, not the opposite...

Thankfully for you, you're too stupid to realize that though.

$C: never gonna happen lil snowflake :)
$C: Making a rule keeping E-commerce a free market is a good thing. Or don't you like free markets?
$C: Uh... You seem confused. That is the point of NN
$C: [Ih, here they are rooting for the death of dozens of Palestinians](https://reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/8jygrj/_/dz3uvd1/?context=1). They enjoy the slaughter of protesters as long as a right-wing government is friendly to Precious Daddy. And some want to murder Mexicans, too!
$C: [Here is a cult member claiming the President never rests](https://reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/8jxg6u/_/dz3acqn/?context=1), even though Trump golfs 3days a week, watched FOX News constantly and has much of the day scheduled for “executive time.”
$C: I'm almost positive Spez is an active functioning Nazi. He straight up ignores all questions on why he allows bigotry on his website, while selectively enforcing rules against subreddits that dont follow his vision for the website. Just look through his AMA's.
$C: [And here are some cretins brigading another sub, earlier today, which is also against site rules.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/8jwhah/the_donald_coordinates_a_small_brigade_against/) The admins will certainly turn yet another blind eye.
$C: Seems a bit excessive. If we're talking about illegal actions I could name about 90 people if given 3 or so hours who are currently in our government and deserve jail a lot more than a single regulator
$C: Snowden leaked confidential government secrets showing both secret government stuffs and how the government is monitoring everybody? I mean, aren't whistleblowers a good thing?
$C: I thought you guys love free markets? NN keeps e commerce, a half a trillion dollars industry, free from outside influence. 
$C: Then why are you on it?
$C: And you believe this shit?
$C: We're just gonna go ahead and ignore it because Crowder is an idiot.
$C: We did it for the Senate, we need to keep doing this stuff for the House. 
$C: if it gets to trumps desk he'll sign it because he's desperate for literally any accomplishment after a year and 3 months of fucking nothing
$C: Oh no government protects freedom on the net, how horrible 
$C: That is not how net neutrality works, you ignoramus.
$C: The Republicans.
$C: Yeah. I think we’re on the same page. 
$C: It doesn't affect everyone. It doesn't affect Australia because we don't have net neutrality, but instead have a consumer watchdog and a non-monopolised ISP market. If you're not American, do some research on your own country's situation before assuming this affects you at all. 
$C: Not pointless. 

The point is to get opposition on record. Before there was a vote, it was simply the FCC who could be blamed. Now, Dems have republicans saying "no" so come november, voters can be reminded who has their best interests in mind. 

Yes it's political. Yes I explained it with the political spin. This is why these impossible votes are made and fought over. Just to get people on record. 
$C: No don’t think that’s right, fuck spez but hate him for what he actually does. Like tampering with T_D and complete breaking trust in his abuse of power.
$C: It's hard to say for sure. The FCC has been dragging their feet through the mud when it actually comes to what the new policy would be. That new policy hasn't gone into effect yet. 
$C: Nope.   I just hope it’ll be out of the FCCs hands completely.
$C: That doesn't mean someone won't manage to find a loophole to crawl through. Where there's a will, there's a way, and that especially holds true when profits are on the line.
$C: Bureacrats make laws
$C: Ajit Pai must have downvoted my post. What a fucker. 
$C: > A thanks to my senator Susan Collins for being one of only 3 republicans to vote for the bill. This is something Maine wants and you are doing us a solid.

you realize she collaborated with her party right?

only say thanks when the vote is signed by the president.

> I'm still pissed at you for the tax bill vote though. Like WTF?

this vote was only for show. She wants to win the reelection.
$C: Other than Susan Collins, John Kennedy, and Lisa Murkowski, all Republicans voted against and all Democrats voted for. 
$C: Tupac cares, if don't nobody else care.
$C: Apparently two lines is too much reading for redditors.
$C: Wtf are you talking about? Seriously, explain to me why ISPs are spending millions lobbying to ensure they can create a dual speed internet if all is fine as you say.
$C: This is just a Senate bill. It will die in the House and then you all can start crying again.
$C: It now has to go through the GOP dominated House, where it will almost certainly fail.

Then it would need to go to Trump, who has spoken out against net neutrality as a very bad thing Obama did.  So yeah, there is little chance of it actually passing.
$C: Haha yes, I never know whether getting rid of it is good or bad
$C: Due to the way the Internet infrastructure works, it's already not a free market. The majority of the US only has either one or two options for internet, so competition to keep prices reasonable isn't a thing.
$C: "Curb competition" like most areas don't already only have one or two choices. Given the way Internet is set up, it's already not a free market.
$C: The reason there are so few options is twofold: one, setting up a new ISP is *incredibly* expensive and slow to make returns, so investors are unlikely to back someone in it. You've basically got to pay out of pocket. Two, already-set ISPs often fight dirty and will use their larger budget to squish any intruders with false law suits intended to just slow them down and drain their bank.
$C: you people have a bad habit of saying things that are complete bullshit and then posting rambling youtube videos by nobodies that no one cares about as if it proves you right
$C: Amongst the enormous mountains of evidence that suggest regulated protected access and no corporate restrictions to the internet are good things, you present a counterpoint: A 50 min YouTube video of gibberish, where two gentlemen boringly talk about nothing, with several thousand likes. I wish you the best sir, because Reddit is not going to be kind to you 
$C: The Republicans voted against it, though.
$C: Fun fact: you don't know what communism is.
$C: Imagine being such worthless subhuman trash that you call a racist dementia patient "daddy"
$C: No he didn't.
$C: Good luck viewing your favorite type\(s\) of porn\(s\) if you fuck net neutrality.
$C: Tell me about it. Say goodbye to any internet innovation if it becomes a public utility again
$C: > I will gladly switch to a different ISP

too bad there is only 1 in your area 
$C: I really hope that one day you realize how funny it is to a lot of people that **you** are accusing people of being brain dead repeaters of whatever they read. 
$C: If net neutrality ended, internet service providers (ISP’s) could pick and choose what content is provided at the speed they wanted. So, if you liked content from a particular company that wasn’t supported, funded, or backed  by your ISP they could throttle or disable that content. For example: you like Netflix, your ISP gets no funding or benefit from Netflix, they disable access or throttle download speed to low resolution, just because they can. Net neutrality laws keep that kind of behavior from occurring for internet content.  Hopefully that explains it well enough.
$C: If you can't find reasons why its important you must have literally not even tried to look. 
$C: It currently has 7793 points and rising.

It’s the very first post on /r/all. 
$C: I don't see how letting the government regulate ISPs in the consumers best interest is worse than letting the ISPs gouge the shit out of consumers and content providers. 

Oh wait, I forgot that literally any government action is a slippery slope and that business = good while government = bad. I can see how you might be against net neutrality if your entire ideology is that fucking simple. 


$C: NN has been around this whole time they repealed it but that takes time to take effect and a lot more when it starts a garage fire of this magnitude.

TL:DR NN hasn't stopped
$C: That’s because the changes haven’t been put into effect yet, June is when if I recall correctly 
$C: the reversing of the net neutrality rule doesn't go into effect until June.

It will still go into effect. The Senate bill won't get on the floor of the house, much less to the president's desk, unfortunately.

I wouldn't expect anything immediately in June either. In order to abuse their position as gatekeepers in the anti\-competitive Internet Service Providing market, ISP's have to vertically integrate and buy or produce internet content \(e.g. AT&T buying Time Warner\) or make deals with big players in the internet content business. That will take a bit of time. 
$C: why should the government let AT&T throttle Netflix in favor of their Time Warner streaming services?

It's called a vertical trust. Abuse market control of an anti\-competitive market to gain an unfair edge in a more lucrative second market.
$C: You need to stop believing everything you hear in the media. 

>otherwise free market

Hahahahahahahaha
$C: Wow, projecting much?
$C: [deleted]
$C: New and cheaper ISPs don't exist because the cost of setting up even a small Internet section is ridiculously high. Killing net neutrality won't change that.
$C: Because corporations have proven time and time again that they cannot be trusted to play fair without the government regulating them.
$C: Yeah, this is actually a line of corporate bs fed to people to stir the pot

Net Neutrality has existed since the beginning of the internet and has always been a grassroots movement. Just because google and facebook support it doesn't mean it's the wrong way.

The other option is monopolies dicking around customers.

If you want to stop them selling our data to governments, *make it illegal for them to sell our data to governments*

"ALLOW US TO DRIVE ON THE ROADS AT THE SPEED LIMIT POSTED ON THE SIGNS!"

Also Reddit:

"BAN AWFUL DRIVERS"
$C: that's exactly what net "neutrality" is
$C: Ok I get that you don't like the new design but maybe stick to complaining about it in threads that actually are related to it in some way?
$C: 😂😂
$C: Hmm?
$C: Since you've apparently read it, what specifically are you referring to?
$C: "virtue signaling", seen as bad by those who have no virtues with which to signal
$C: Hey, J0HN-GALT, just a quick heads-up:  
**propoganda** is actually spelled **propaganda**. You can remember it by **begins with propa-**.

>Yeah, now we can reinstate the regulations that prevented The ISP's from throttling your internet speeds; what they never did that.

yes they did, its been well documented multiple times. netflix/comcast is a good example.

>All I am saying is that it would make a lot more sense if they rewrote the existing bills adding

without specifics your comment is useless. NN rules put into place where good rules and hardly heavy handed. putting rules in place to prevent monopolies from abusing their position is pretty standard. especially when the rules only maintain are the supposed status quo. How can they be heavy handed if the rules only enforce what has been considered the status quo since the internet was started.



$C: Here's a sourced list originally posted by /u/Skrattybones of all the times ISPs violated net neutrality:

> 2005 - Madison River Communications was blocking VOIP services. [The FCC put a stop to it.](https://www.cnet.com/news/telco-agrees-to-stop-blocking-voip-calls/)

but, yeah.
$C: Not yet, still has to go through the house
$C: [deleted]
$C: Apple isn't an ISP. Apple has never been an ISP. Net Neutrality would never have hindered Apple.

Net neutrality has been the policy of the FCC since 2005. The FCC started this under President Bush. The 2015 rule was a replacement for an earlier rule that got overturned in court in 2014.
$C: Found the Russian troll
$C: where did you copy and paste this absolute horseshit from
$C: internet provider monopolies stem from a lack of "bullshit regulations"
$C: What a stupid sentiment. Not all regulations are bad. 
$C: Evil, disgusting liberals only care about net neutrality so they can give Silicon Valley more money with which to censor free speech.

$C: Are you four.
$C: > “Which is the complete antithesis of his entire agenda, which is to do the opposite of every single thing supported by the previous administration.”

Homeboy enacted a lot of TERRIBLE policies while he was in office. The rub for you all is that had he done it the proper way through Congress all of his “work” wouldn’t be so easy to undo.

$C: Why would you do that? 
$C: Nono you got it backwards bud, net neutrality = good
$C: You really made another account just for that..? Kinda sad.
$C: More or less government is an absolutely terrible and lazy way to look at governance. Whether or not government should take action should be evaluated on a case by case basis.

Doing otherwise is to place ideology above effectiveness and efficiency. Should the FAA stop issuing new regulations in response to accidents?
$C: Nice cable company talking points you've got there.
$C: How?
$C: Spot on ....
$C: Good
$C: Are you bot? I find it hard to believe that people genuinely want NN gone.
$C: I think it would be helpful if Reddit started a call to action on this sooner rather than later.

The message should not be simply “I support this please vote for it” - That lets them table it as something they can deal with later (and inevitably won’t). It should be phrased that, if they do not support this measure, they **will** lose reelection. The entire house is up for re-election this year, so they’re going to care about things that might mean they could lose. Democratic voters have been energized by Trump’s bullshit, and historically [the president’s party loses seats in the midterms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_midterm_election). Republicans (who are more likely to oppose this) know that they could face a very tough uphill battle in November, and so likely will be open to anything that helps them there. Net Neutrality has proven bipartisan support amongst voters (once the concept has been explained anyway), so supporting this is easy points for them. 

This cannot be something that we eventually decide to raise hell on for a few days. This needs to be something constantly hanging over Representatives heads. It needs to be unavoidable and public. Reddit has a very large user base, and that could send a very strong message on this topic.
$C: I read somewhere that the best way to get a representative’s ear was to write an op-ed in the paper and make sure their name is in it, calling them out on a subject.  It’s a sure fire way to know they’ll read your opinion AND if it’s something that has a lot of backing (like restoring net neutrality) that they are more likely to respond positively.

Most importantly, ***PLEASE MAKE AN INFORMED VOTE DURING YOUR NEXT ELECTION***.
$C: I want a red name too, can we arrange that? Looks pretty cool. 
$C: If you make everyone on Reddit admin for a day, we could better show legislators we care AND preemptively destroy Reddit's redesign. Two birds with one stone
$C: What are the odds, once this reaches the desk of the President, that Trump would Veto it and it would fail? This has a massive following behind it, and the backlash directed at trump would be monumental.

Edit: you guys are pessimistic as hell. Have some hope, you guys!
$C: Perhaps there can be a sort of call to people who are not yet registered to vote to go ahead and register under the pretense of voting against every representative who votes against net neutrality?

If I'm not mistaken, voter registration percentage and turnout are both pretty terrible, especially in reddit's main demographic. If a sizable and anomalous influx of new voter registrations during a sort of campaign to vote anti-net-neutrality representatives out of office, I would certainly think that would be threatening enough to sway the vote in our favor.

Edit: a word
$C: 1) **press conference on the east lawn with supporters in Congress and the tech CEOs.** If you do that alongside a demonstration (if you can get the people to come out), and get a catchy slogan/phrase "War for the internet" etc, it's good TV. Starts the national conversation again. 

. 

2) Also **getting signatures for a Dear Colleague letter** is good, maybe especially if you polarize on that "Sign the letter or you'll be considered against Net Neutrality and consumer rights".

. 

3) **briefings in the senate and house office buildings** if you haven't already done that. Especially if you **get good food**. If you don't get food it's not worth it. Staffer salaries are so low they're supplemented by free food at the briefings and receptions (attach the fact sheet to the food if possible). Also **have an open bar at the reception**, if you're doing that. 

. 

4) Be unique and splashy. Some animal organization **brought baby tigers once as a 'briefing' and took pictures of people with it** (posting them all online later) and the line was damn near an hour long. That's a way to make waves.

. 

5) **Host a light up the lines campaign day or week on reddit**, trying to get people to call into their office. Maybe hand out a reddit badge to people who participate (by going to their Congressional office and taking a pic or maybe filling out a report back Google form after the call).

. 

6) You could get people to sign up via Google form for a proper **(scheduled) visit to their Congressional office in a group** - allying with Indivisible or MoveOn or whatever coalition would be good for this.

. 

7) You can get people to sign up for a text club like Daily Action. Send em a reminder to call into their office, and ask if they have done it or 'remind later'. This can be automated pretty easily and there's a number of options out there like Hustle or Relay. I know a premier national texting campaign organizer if you need to hire one (there's plenty of consulting firms for this).
$C: That is an amazing font color. I can't get over how perfect that red is.

Ignore me, I'll be on my way
$C: Thank you for the updates.

It's somewhat sad that this keeps popping up, over and over, even though people obviously care about it.

I'm glad that we won this time, but it's also telling about the greed we face in this world...
$C: I think Reddit believes it's really important and it's nice to have the pertinent info all in one place, I say yes to another thread when it goes to the house! 
$C: We wouldn't be going through this if companies like reddit didn't allow a bunch of paid fake accounts to influence our election. Yet we still have /r/the_donald and still have trolling in full force.


Edit: Thanks for proving my point guys =) 
$C: As an outside observer, I wonder: why bother with all this when the end result will be Trump using his veto power?
$C: For one week, require subscriptions for the most popular subreddits, i.e., $1.99 for the gif subreddits package, $1.99 for the memes package, etc.

Then donate all the money raised evenly among the representatives who vote to restore NN.
$C: Are you secretly Aaron Schwartz? 

$C: Good guy admin escapes his parentheses.
$C: You didn't win anything... still has to go through the house, which it won't pass
$C: >\(let us know if you have ideas!\)

Okay, hear me out.

We all show up in snoo outfits
$C: If this post included what net neutrality is that would have been helpful
$C: Whoa wtf is red ? 
$C: How’s it looking in the House?
$C: Most GOP house members do not care if you care about this.   They vote like they don't need your support because they do not expect a fair election in 2018 and neither should you.
$C: How far out is this vote, is there any chance they can prevent this vote from occurring before congress goes into recess with a filibuster? There's a good chance the vote would pass if that happened.
$C: I hope the house rejects this. 
$C: have you considered the viewpoints of people that oppose net neutrality or will you just do everything you can to minimize their voices?
$C: Is there any way I can get my username red like that? 
$C: To piggyback this, get involved with groups like Fight for the Future! I’ve been working with them for about 2 months producing video content to send to our senator (Kennedy, R LA., who flipped!)

If their constituents and businesses all speak up, they eventually have to listen. 
$C: Who do we let know about not wanting "New" reddit? 
$C: I live in Canada but would like to contribute to this cause, anything Canadians can do to help?
$C: Fuck net neutrality. Stop censoring free speech.
$C: I believe the house has said they won't vote on it and Teump has said he would veto it if it made it to his desk. 
$C: The next course of action is nothing.  This bill, or anything similar will NOT pass in the house.  Possibly after the mid trems election cycle, but that's not guaranteed either.  The current bill is symbolic at best. As long as trump is in office net neutrality is dead.
$C: Trump ain’t gonna sign it. What a waste of time 
$C: That Dick  president will never sign on restoring Net Neutrality. It's the responsability of the voters to get rid of this administration.  Fuck never vote of for those pussy republican that focus on the economy by aiding the rich and supporting arms dealers
$C: So what does this all mean?? Sorry but I am confused about all of this. 
$C: You should do a pie chart of the results 
$C: You are so misguided about what NN is and how it affects freedom and the daily users...
$C: R
$C: Idea: Block all the subreddits for the political campaigns of everyone who votes against net neutrality.  They're literally opting-in for that behavior, so you don't need to feel like it's not ethical (or even desired!).
$C: > let us know if you have ideas

Accept reality? It likely won't even get a vote in the House. This isn't a victory, it's a forlorn hope.

It's sad, it's horrible, and I recommend VPNing all your traffic in the future through a reliable provider of such services. But please don't pretend a vote in the Senate is some sort of victory beyond the most symbolic measures. Otherwise you're just click-baiting.
$C: Ryan refusing to bring it to vote will only give people another reason to bring the blunami.
$C: As if Paul Ryan has the courage to put an official vote behind his convictions. AT&T paid good money to end net neutrality, and the GOP doesn't want to explain that to you. 
$C: And even if it does go to a vote and the Republican controlled house votes it through for some mad reason, Trump will just veto it anyway, so... yay?
$C: Top kek
$C: But both parties are the same!!!


$C: Friendly reminder: Rand Paul is a pretend libertarian and doesn't have any real principles.
$C: Reasons why I don't like a 2 party system.
$C: Republicans are born with an innate sense of rabid corporatism. 
$C: Props to the 4 republicans who jumped party lines though! 
$C: Who would've thought that members of a party that doesn't support a policy would vote for the repeal of it?
$C: One party is old racist white dudes and the other are old white dudes?
$C: Correlation doesn't imply causation but yeah... that's a huge sample size
$C: Agreed.

Also, I'm torn about your apostrophe. On the one hand, plural esses shouldn't have apostrophes, on the other, "againsts" just looks plain weird. I'd go with quotes around the word but not the S, as in:

> "against"s.

Nah, that looks weird too. I dunno, I'm out of ideas.
$C: Serious naive question- why? How is this even partisan?
$C: The Democrats are fighting a populist progressive uprising.  The party couldn't afford dissent on this one, and must have twisted some arms really hard.
$C: It should tell you how much this issue was made political but people here don’t understand what’s really going on. This literally makes it so the government can force ISPs to shut down sites and channels of information it doesn’t agree with.

Edit: I linked the legislation below and still people censor-by-downvote because they don’t like it. 

I’m starting to think people here do know what this means and actually like it. Smh. 

But unlike most of you, I appreciate the other side of an argument. So please, tell me those laws really weren’t passed and really didn’t make these things legal. Would be good news. Or tell me this latest NN bill is the improved one that would never allow this kind of nationalization and federal oversight of the internet.

That is... if anyone even sees this now. The censorship by downvote technique on this site is pretty effective. 
$C: The argument is always presented as government overreach. The Republican party is often the one calling for small government. (though the Republican watered down bill introduced by Thule would have prevented states from making stronger net neutrality bills. State's Rights y'all... oh wait, unless it's something we don't like)

The argument I usually hear is that the regulations hurt competition which is what makes better internet for cheaper. I know I'm boiling it down there but really I haven't heard many arguments beyond that.

Of course on the competition front... look up a map of where Time Warner and Comcast overlap and ask is there really any competition happening.
$C: I just did a quick Google search and found a couple articles pretty much saying most people, both sides, are for net neutrality. It's republican politicians that oppose it, for a variety of reasons. As someone who has voted mostly republican, it's pretty sad to see. 
$C: Because ISPs realized that they'd be better off bribing half of congress a lot than bribing all of it a little.
$C: The argument is that government shouldn't control the web because most people running the government are pretty behind on technology.
$C: a free market would not force net neutrality.

unfortunately it has to because of monopolistic zoning laws/policies/deals.

I am against net neutrality: I am for breaking up horrid zoning and giving people choices of providers.

The only way these shitskulls could get away with a non-neutral net would be because people have no other choice. 

if you had the choice of ISPa and ISPb and one of them is neutral and the other isn't, they have all the same access and cost the same, which would you pick?

$C: Because they're bankrolled by cable companies and ISP's.
$C: It's not the federal government's job. Tenth amendment lays out clear things the federal government should be doing.

That being said, they frequently ignore the tenth amendment. Everyone does.
$C: Because they are evil !!!!11
$C: It's not that we don't want net neutrality, it's that "net neutrality" is a false debate. People present it as "this will happen if we don't have net neutrality, so we want net neutrality", however almost everything listed in that list, has almost no chance of happening because it would be harmful for the companies providing the service. Basically I'm for "net neutrality" but against "Net Neutrality" as legislation.
$C: There emerges a pattern with those 47 pretty quickly, if one is willing to look. Said pattern should make any thinking person come to fairly obvious conclusions about which of their political representatives actually values the freedoms of their constituents as opposed to those that only pay lip service to their constituents without any actual concern for their well-being. 
$C: the rep who vote for net neutrality  are facing pretty much contested districts.

they are not angels, the help conspire for betsy devos.
$C: How are we supposed to keep track of the 47 people not to vote for?  If only there were a simple way to **R**emember.  
$C: I mean it's not really a concise list of 47 people that should get voted out of office at the end of their next term but I get your point.
$C: There's a reason I went immediately looking. Unfortunately Roy Blunt is the one in my state that voted against and he isn't leaving until 2020
$C: >More people should be aware of this list

This list is the whole reason the vote happened.  Zero chance the House passes the bill.  But the list is going to be thrown up on at least half of all Democratic congressional campaign ads this fall.
$C: It’s not surprising but fuck them. 
$C: Well, now I don't have to say it. 
But I will anyway. 
Fuck them both.
$C: ALWAYS! Texans should be embarrassed by the people we currently have elected in office. One of them is a dude that had a fucking tree fall on him, he sued, then made a law so that no one could EVER do the same thing again. Lmao, I mean, it's pretty obvious we have corrupt politicians in Texas, and we always have. 
$C: Vote out Cruz in November. It would be amazing.
$C: What's with democrats and the F-word? 

$C: Right on. Big props for putting that together 🤠
$C: Someone post this to T_D and phrase it as 'corrupt democrat shills vote for unpatriotic NN ruling'
$C: I'm not American but in no state of mind would I vote for a Republican. They're just shitting on all the good stuff that could happen. 
$C: Wow, it's like republicans say fuck you to everybody every chance they get.  How do they even exist?  People must be fucking retarded to vote for them.
$C: Thank you for this.
$C: Damn, how much time did this take you?
$C: Is one side just evil? Holy fuck. 
$C: Underrated comment still.

This is why i dont understand your nation anymore.
Bipartisan support for e.g. NN, yet the representatives FUCK YOUR FACE, then again, and again. Youd think at some point youd drown in cum. 
$C: Not disputing the figures but that is a confusing way to provide the data. Columns of For has both party names, Against has both numbers. 

How about the following format?

||For|Against|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Rep|W|X|
|Dem|Y|Z|
$C: This is an amazing list. Is there a way to get this some more attention? I mean in media. /u/ohaioohio has put together some basic data here in a clear manner that I think everyone can understand. Even if you take away the extremely partisan morality-based votes like things around family planning and sexual preference, what you have here is a pretty amazing list that I think it would be hard to argue with. 

Campaign finance reform, voting reform, credit default swaps, genetic testing for health insurance... These are pretty much no-brainers that nonetheless got huge resistance from the Republican party.

In fact, if this list was to get more attention, it should specifically exclude the big morality issues that no one will ever agree on because it's just going to cause a ton of static. That's what happens in our discussions over and over again and it gets us nowhere when there are things that could be fixed in the voting booth.

If you're voting against abortion because you genuinely feel that it's murder and your constituents feel the same way, then vote with your heart. If you're hiding behind that so that you can point to it as a distraction as you vote to directly give tax breaks to your top 1% donors, then you're corrupt.
$C: What's scariest to me is how both parties are this monolithic. In a country with only 2 parties of this size you would expect a little bit more people going against the will of the party.
$C: Commenting for future reference
$C: I'm still sympathetic to the argument that both parties are *bad*. \(The Democrats are, for example, largely opposed to democracy and still in the pockets of big business, especially on the state level in Dem\-dominated states, which can be infuriating and exhausting.\)

But at some point you gotta realize it's the difference in bad between a hedonistic, irresponsible tyrant \(the Dems\) and a nuclear missile targeted at every major population center in the country \(the Republicans\). No matter how much you want the first not to happen, at least the tyrant wants the country to continue existing and more or less function!
$C: Oh look, a copy pasta.
$C: Yeah I sure did love when one of [our senators](https://i.redd.it/qxxz7tavr3401.jpg) called anyone who disagrees with him about NN “snowflakes” and said we believe in “propaganda”. I’m still taken aback by how absolutely pathetic Cruz’s behavior in particular is. This guy is supposed to represent us, instead he’s mocking us and calling us names.

It’s been months since this tweet and I still can’t believe that it’s real or that he actually said this- but it is in fact real. He has no respect, absolutely NONE, for anyone who disagrees with him.

I’m looking forward to voting against him. 

edit: formatting
$C: As a Georgian, same.
$C: Not good enough Tex 
$C: Don’t apologise, fucking do something
$C: Seriously, god damn what an embarrassment.  We are better than this.
$C: As an Iowan I swear I have not nor will I ever for for Ernst or Grassley. 
$C: Utah. Same. 
$C: You can do something about this by voting and campaigning for Beto before this year's election! 

Rafael "Ted" Cruz can fuck right off.
$C: Yeah, I had some faith in Cornyn during the SOPA issue, but the way he handled his constituents with Net Neutrality by sticking his fingers in his ears means he’s got to GO. With as big as tech is in the big cities of Texas, his seats going to go to someone else real quick. I’m actually voting for once after this stunt.

And Texans, don’t just vote for the D. Vote against him in the primaries, too.
$C: As a Georgian, me too. 
$C: All of them, or just the politicians? 😉
$C: turn your state blue man. change texas forever.
$C: I already wasn't going to vote for Tim Scott, the list just solidifies it
$C: Except for those three who voted against party lines, I'm honestly pretty surprised and impressed they did so.
$C: I mean it is possible that some of those people believe that net neutrality has to go, not all but some.
$C: Yeah but check how many people in this thread are explaining to us how the democrats are the party of corporate interests. 
$C: Do you really think democrats are not bought and paid for?? LOL
$C: You really don't think Democrats are also bought and paid for? There's definitely lobbyists in favor of net neutrality, along with a ton of other people who buy them out. Most politicians are bought. Doesn't matter the party.
$C: We're going to flip his seat this November. /r/bluemidterm2018
$C: Agreed -- Flake is a Fake.
$C: >he's still a lowlife Republican piece of shit

Woah there, that takes it a bit too far. As the voting shows, not all Republicans are against Net Neutrality, especially not all Republican voters. Let's just simply say that guy is an asshole.
$C: I know right! I never would of expected a Louisiana Republican to go against the party!
$C: You know I normally vote Republican. And I'm always the first one to pipe up and say how both parties are two halves of the same coin, they both suck. But looking at this list causes me shame. 

Like goddamnit. Could that list be anymore stereotypical? I think we need to break out the guillotine. The Republican Party needs a reign of terror. All the old fucks that made the Bush Administration such a shit show are still in power and its preventing the Republican party from getting any real work done. 

The policitcal census of the country has changed a lot in 20 years. The Republican party hasn't. And its made the Republican Party a literal parody of itself. 
$C: You. I like you.
$C: Hey now hey. He can't help his looks.

Being a corporate shill for Prime and such however...
$C: Also Missourian. His crooked ass needs to be removed.
$C: Democrats: for the rights of the people sometimes.

Republicans: for the profits of corporations.

Democrats are definitely not at fault.  They’re just not ALWAYS at fault.
$C: I'm actually for net neutrality, but I think you took your generalization way out of proportions. It's definitely important, but neither side has tried to use anti trust to break up these monopolies and promote competition, which is a much larger issue. 
$C: Except for guns and free speech.
$C: First off. If you dont think that both sides have ties to corporations and work to see them profit, you are ignorant. Both sides of the political spectrum are beholden to a number of special interest groups and corporations. Also I believe that currently the political parties themselves support ideals and policies not consistent with the majority of their constituents.  (Doing whats best for the perpetuation of the party rather than what their voters believe or want)
And secondly, if you look at the views of the parties now. Democrats are usually liberal/progressive types pushing more socialist policies. (They want a more centralized and larger government) This causes them to collectivize issues and use the lens of identity politics. Liberals/ progressives care for everyone, however they seperate people into groups based on gender/race/sexual orientation etc. in an attempt to better address the concerns of the people. Often giving preference to groups that are perceived to be disadvantaged or oppressed. (Group identity > individual identity) So yes, in an indirect way they are "for the rights of the people." Republicans on the other hand are usually conservative (which isnt a synonym for Republican btw)/ libertarian types. Both of these poltical philosophies operate on the basic premise of the sovereignty of the individual and individual liberty. (Want a smaller decentralized government) Conservatives/libertarians also care for everyone, and tend not to group people based on the above mentioned characteristics. They generally make decisions based on a person's individual merits rather than what demographic  group they fall under (Individual identity > Group identity.) So those on the right side of the spectrum are for the rights of the people as well. Just more directly. 

In conclusion.  You are  biased and ignorant to what is actually happening.  Your statement regarding the objectives of the 2 parties is very reductive and does not account for what they actually stand for. It also cherrypicks the vote on one issue to promote this biased reduction. Votes on the majority of policies/issues have become increasingly divided and gridlocked. Political parties are not operating true to what their voters believe and the poltical philosophies attached to the parties. 
$C: Democrats absolutely vote for the profits of corporations. Just different ones. 
$C: Democrats: Take your money through subsidy

Republicans: Choose who your money goes to

Seems like Republicans have the grown up version.
$C: As a European the colours of your parties always confused me. In the rest of the world, the colour red has usually been associated with the left, and the colour blue been associated with the right. Is there some historical explanation for the colours if the parties in the US?
$C: Basically my entire state is red, except for one big city. So we are throw a blue state. Good ol Illinois. Take a look at the Illinois presidential election map sometime and you'll see what I mean. 
$C: Low taxes, low cost of living, no one trying to make me feel like a criminal for owning guns... I like it. 
$C: Trust me blue states are worse 

Edit: It depends on your personal preference reddit fyi 
$C: TIL that Bernie "This is America" Sanders is actually named Bernard, after the big loveable dog St. Bernard. Even more reason to vote for him!

^^^r/circlejerk
$C: 2 independents and 3 repubs actually :)
$C: It's not line Europe; American legislators are free to do what they want. But they could be attacked on TV for voting with the treasonous, evil Democrats, so it's safer for them to vote no.

You saw it a lot during the Obama admin; vote no, but hope for yes. On a policy level, the party is broken.
$C: Not really.

Any politician who falls to back the party will see the party fail to back them.

Nobody wants to be blacklisted in Washington.
$C: I don't really understand it either. Every argument has always been along the lines of "government overreach" and "competition is good, regulation stifles competition" and hell, I might agree with them in a way. The internet in Kansas City is FAAAAAANTASTIC because Google Fiber is a thing.

But that's one of a very handful of cities. The rest of the country, especially rural... what competition?
$C: Look at the voting history of any issue that gives more power to corrupt mega corporations. Look who voted for what. Note the pattern. 
$C: > Why is the topic of net neutrality such a black and white (Dems vs. Republican) issue?

It probably has nothing to do with what they believe about NN, but rather "I don't like what they like." Almost every issue is so polarizing.  [Article about the matter over the past 60 years](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/23/a-stunning-visualization-of-our-divided-congress/?utm_term=.8f0d50635370) Sure you can say that the majority might have the same mindset, but practically everybody? Across everything? I'd argue there's a problem.
$C: Because anyone who's against it either doesn't understand how the internet works, or is a neckbeard who lives in mom's basement and has never had to pay for their own internet. 
$C: You've pretty much got it down I think.  The problem is that the government isn't particularly responsive to people without money, which increasingly describes most Americans.  That's why this net neutrality business is even a struggle.  
$C: Tbf to Republican voters many of them supported net neutrality as well. The elected reps on the other hand....
$C: > Why is the topic of net neutrality such a black and white (Dems vs. Republican) issue? I'd imagine we could all equally agree that net neutrality is a great thing for the citizens of America, 

who says gop cared about american?

they sell out america and turn it into a corperate hell hole for a quick buck.


$C: Government wants to be able to regulate the content of the internet to keep us safe.
$C: you dont follow politics, do you?

john mccain is basically already on his deathbed.
$C: Probably cause he has brain cancer...
$C: that boy need some milk 
$C: John McCain has been having very serious health issues if I recall correctly. I wish him the best.
$C: Right now McCain has a form of brain cancer that has like a 15% survival rate. I don't follow him as closely, but last I've heard he's doing well in spite of, and I can't say on why on this one, but this is one of the rare cases I can say it's reasonable to say he's distracted from Net Neutrality.
$C: his health is not the best right now 
$C: Lol at calling him "one dude"
$C: Rrrrlly?

Have a nice day!

I have celebrated each day that I've gotten out of the land Walton has by the balls.

Yea. Fuck him.
$C: Pretty sure cancer is kinda keeping him busy.
$C: Um.

I think you got the numbers backwards.
$C: Or they thought they understood it, but didn't.
$C: No - they voted against simply because Obama’s name was tied to it. The only thing that gets them more riled up is Hillary.


$C: Unsurprisingly, there's more context to that quote.  
  
> Net neutrality enjoys bipartisan support among voters according to a survey conducted by Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland last December. That survey found that after the issue was explained to them, 83 percent of respondents, including 89 percent of Democrats and 75 percent of Republicans, favored keeping the Obama-era rules.  
  
It was a study of voters at a university. Not Senators.  
  
Edit: Evidently, the Program for Public Consultation is run *by* the university, not simply at the university. The point remains though.
$C: Business as usual.
$C: It also depends on how they explain it. I guess “removing NN will make the government smaller and restore internet freedom” makes you want to vote against NN if you’ve never heard of it before. And you get a big cheque too.
$C: That’s how most people in the age demographic of the GOP’s main voting base work. If it’s too complicated for them to understand in less than a paragraph, it’s bad/useless/unnecessary. 

It’s easier to not have to think about something and just deny it, than have to realize you lack the critical thinking skills to understand how something works when it’s own name gives a basic description. 
$C: They voted it down because Obama was black.
$C: Maybe we shouldn't elect people who need staffers to teach them how to use a cell phone basically every day.
$C: The irony is that you misunderstood the data given....
$C: Go read /r/conservative. It's terrifying.
$C: The mayonnaise news network can be so entertaining.  
 
Edit: I obviously mean this in a sense that their logic is often hysterical in the worst way... 
$C: Wait, fox is against it? I thought this was one of the issues both sides can hate: the left wants free internet and the right hates government interference so why throttle internet.


$C: Obamacare for the internet as Cruz so elequently put it
$C: Most the people on the pro-nn side dont understand it either.
$C: > Better to have them explained in detail than to have FOX News explain how net neutrality is a LIBTURD, Trump-hating conspiracy.

True!
$C: Or better yet, we can listen to Ben "Wakanda Don't Real" Shapiro about how losing Net Neutrality is actually a good thing. Because it's like a water pipe, but not like a water pipe at the same time. 
$C: Oh yea, I'm sure they'd rather be patronized by CNN and Huffpo, who took a moment from their regularly scheduled Republican rumormill/bashing to explain to them.

It's funny how many liberals fail to see how their woes are being absolutely  pandered to by most of the media, so much so they're completely blind as to why conservatives gravitate to bias sources like Fox. Fox and the like are just islands in a sea.
$C: Exactly. If they explained it the way Reddit does 95% of the time, yeah I can see why people would be against it. But that’s incredibly biased 
$C: Of course it was biased. Probably involved saying that ISPs would have different packages for different services.

Edit: yeah just read it. That final question is so biased and misleading that it's insane. I'm not at all surprised that Reddit is pushing it as proof
$C: I mean, the non\-biased way of explaining net neutrality is basically like, "do want to give isps more power to fuck you over?"

There's no legit argument against NN. 
$C: I don’t like how they keep labeling it as Obama Era Rules. It should just be called Net Neutrality, explained what it is, and have people decide what they like.

I’m independent and I get frustrated very often when people here legislation and immediately ask which side created it. Like form an opinion for yourself!

Sorry, just venting.
$C: Clearly not, as 75% of them voted to keep it...
$C: If Obama had been the one to abolish slavery, you can bet Trump and his followers would be doing everything possible to repeal it. Conservatives have become in my eyes opponents of progress. It seems to me that a lot of the things "libtards" push for are to make EVERYONE have a better life. Conservatives don't care. It seems like they want everyone to be miserable. It disgusts me.
$C: I loved the thing where people wanted to get rid of Obamacare and implement/were fine with the affordable Care act. Like uuuumm
$C: If it was put in place by Obama and the internet was around long before 2008 then what did we do without it then?
$C: This is exactly why politics is so toxic now a days. Most people informed on the subject had a huge problem with isps falling under title II and how much power that gave the government. As well as there being no evidence of any price differences from before and after net neutrality was implimented, while also pointing out that scare tactic about price gouging type actions are already illegal. Net Neutrality did absolutely nothing extra to protect the consumer. Everything is already on the books in same shape or form.

It would be so nice if we lived in a world where people didn't automatically dismiss and trivalise a viewpoint they don't agree with just because "the evil other side" supports it.
$C: He really doesn’t. 
$C: You mean alternative facts?
$C: Probably not many, because Trump makes short sighted decisions that only seem positive to people who can't think more than 24 months ahead.
$C: Why exactly do you think it should be done away with? Not mad, just curious. 
$C: Why do you think it's better to do away with it? 
$C: Then.... I don’t think you understood. 
$C: so are you pro-monopoly, or do you just think that other methods than net neutrality need to be explored

because, I mean, Australia doesn't have net neutrality, and we get along just fine. But we also have dozens upon dozens of ISPs all competing for the same business, so the model works. 
$C: Perhaps you could enlighten the rest of us? There's a free market argument, but it falls apart when the same people that are using it as an argument against net neutrality don't care about the state/local laws that allowed the ISPs to create an oligopoly in the first place.
$C: your opinions are not welcome here
$C: Are you saying it wasn't explained to them? I'm confused as to what you're trying to say.
$C: What?
$C: [deleted]
$C: "I love being right"

Bad b8 m8
$C: You go around touting "valuable debate" but then call people with other opinions "lying liberals". Sorry but I can't take people like this seriously. You aren't interested in debate, you just want to have a shouting match with those damn libtards.
$C: Do you side with the FCC's stance? If so, can you help me understand your reasoning?
$C: You can't be right on a subjective subject. It's too tough to logic you out of a situation you didn't logic yourself into.
$C: I was honestly shocked this wasn’t u/incites. That being said, you’re probably an affiliate of them, yes?
$C: Which country is that if you don’t mind me asking? Removing human rights? huh?
$C: Shouldn't it be the "NO-voters" politicians we should be pressuring? The YES-voters voted to *save* Net Neutrality. 
$C: Ya spread it all over the internet... wasn't the end of net neutrality supposed to end the internet? Weird...
$C: Everyone forgets midterms, they're there to balance shit out.
$C: The House Seats will be big.
$C: Shill
$C: All but 3 republicans.
$C: I'm guessing there'll be one person who votes no... The POTUS who's hell bent on reversing anything that was done with Obama. 
$C: Or are getting paid to look the other way
$C: Sure they can, how else would they know how much they're being paid to vote no?
$C: You can name a bill a thing you want, it doesn’t have to have anything to do with its contents. The net neutrality bill is honestly pretty weak and is basically a shitty bandaid to the bigger problem of local monopolies. 

Honestly I’d rather have this bill fail and have Reddit focus on a bill that breaks up local monopolies so real competition can happen. 
$C: Or they just opposed Title II? I agree with NN on principle but not as it stands in the paper right now.
$C: We didn't get to this point by giving up.  We wouldn't be here if we dropped the battle years ago.  You might not think fighting back is doing anything, but without punching back we'd probably get it up the ass even worse.
$C: who was swung?
$C: Definitely, it's the first step in the process, but the closeness makes me think it's no time to relax now, there's still a way to go yet.
$C: How is this a win if it doesn’t pass the House? It’s like celebrating a first down when you need a touchdown to win and the game just ended 
$C: both independents caucus with the Democrats so you can basically include them in the Dem count
$C: Exactly. Bell and most other companies are already trying to pressure the CRTC into passing a censor bill, so everything that's about Net Neutrality can have a link here
$C: Thanks for another submission Donald, God bless! 
$C: Yeah so it's important not to veto this.  Remember, Vetos make Obama happy.
$C: I can potentially limit his choices indirectly. Any company that was negatively targetted by the US ISP's would be crippled in terms of competition with those companies that benefited from it. Doesn't matter that they are on a level playing field elsewhere, they're at a disadvantage in one of the largest markets in the world. 

Said companies might then have to spend more to compete and thus have less capital to invest in better products (or worse.)
$C: Why does the US allow those tier 1 carriers to hold monopoly anyway? 
$C: The US does produce a good amount of content that i use though which could be affected
$C: "The so-called leaks coming out of the White House are a massive over exaggeration put out by the Fake News Media in order to make us look as bad as possible. With that being said, leakers are traitors and cowards, and we will find out who they are!" -- 14 May, 2018
$C: In the span of hours and minutes sometimes.

I'm all for changing someones mind with a good, logical and reasonable argument. Not just because "That guy did it so I won't".
$C: Well, he needs the support of the republicans and that's How it is done.
$C: There is one big lie, intentional or otherwise.   Trump lies like that every week.
$C: I think the joke went RIGHT over your head.
$C: No, who would? Trump is president now, time to stop talking about Obama/Hillary and not play a stupid game of whataboutism.
$C: You realize that the portion I quoted was a joke. And that my joke was pointing out that joke.

There's a difference between "changing their mind" and "flopping like a fish". I'll let you guess which was the joke here.
$C:  This is one example out of many that should be used to shut down the "both sides are the same" idiocy.
$C: If house and Senate both approve it the president doesn't need to sign it. It will become law. After a certain amount of days sitting on his desk it becomes law
$C: This is important. Actual voters tend to be the older generation. They probably are more conservative, so it's tipped towards republicans. People have fought for your voting rights, made sacrifices to pass voting rights laws, yet only 58% of eligible voters actually voted in 2016! (One of the worst in developed countries).  It doesn't matter if you're for or against, but go to the polls to fix these issues instead of just being angry nothing's happening! Every vote counts.

P.S. This isn't in an angry tone.
$C: It's almost like reb hate big govt. Which is what this is.  C'mon
$C: [deleted]
$C: at least we've gotten good at this.
$C: Neither will they
$C: It probably won't even come to a vote. Paul "the coward" Ryan will not want to piss off his corporate masters by bringing it to the floor.
$C: The only people that benefit from this is internet providers. You’re a clueless moron if you support getting rid of NN outside of of monetary gains for internet providers. 
$C: Since when does the government care about what citizens want? 
$C: Not among Fox viewers I’m afraid. They’ve been led to believe NN is bad because Obama.
$C: Worth = $0
$C: Not really because nothing is going to happen.  Remember everyone already died when it was originally removed. And we’ll be back to 2015 when it wasn’t intact. 
$C: Agreed. I guarantee Ryan will not even allow it to come to a vote. 

Coward.
$C: But symbolism sways elections.  And even with a tailwind this year, Democrats have an uphill climb in the Senate, defending 20+ seats to the Republicans 6.

When elections are often divided by 1-2% of total voters, getting a popular punch landed on your opponent can make a lot of difference.
$C: Yeah I don’t get the celebration. This is far from being passed. Its a victory in the battle from corporate control but the war is from from won (sorry for sounding overly dramatic)
$C: >	Taking away net neutrality means $$$ for telecoms

Maybe, but no one knows. It hasn’t materialized yet, so it’s mostly speculation. 
$C: **Congressional Review Act**

The Congressional Review Act (CRA) is a law that was enacted by the United States Congress under House Speaker Newt Gingrich as Subtitle E of the Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996 (Pub.L. 104–121) and signed into law by President Bill Clinton on March 29, 1996. The law empowers Congress to review, by means of an expedited legislative process, new federal regulations issued by government agencies and, by passage of a joint resolution, to overrule a regulation. Once a rule is thus repealed, the CRA also prohibits the reissuing of the rule in substantially the same form or the issuing of a new rule that is substantially the same "unless the reissued or new rule is specifically authorized by a law enacted after the date of the joint resolution disapproving the original rule" (5 U.S. Code § 801(b)(2)). Congress has a window of time lasting 60 legislative days (i.e., days that Congress is actually in session, rather than simple calendar days) to disapprove of any given rule by simple majority vote; otherwise, the rule will go into effect at the end of this period.

$C: >Trump would probably be fine with it, as he was basically just not happy about the FCC "legislating".

Yeah, that's not even fucking close to being true. He railed against net neutrality itself, not the manner in which it was protected, despite transparently having fuckall idea what it means. He said, "Net neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine" and claimed it would somehow be used to target conservatives. As with anything else, lacking any and all understanding of the actual issue, his only reason for opposing it is that Obama supported it.
$C: > Trump would probably be fine with it, as he was basically just not happy about the FCC "legislating".

This is just a repeal of the thing the FCC did lmao, it would go back to before.
$C: Honestly given how much the Right has such disdain for... people in general, they may hate Net Neutrality BECAUSE the public wants it and doing what the public wants is "Socialism"
$C:  Here in lies the issue at hand. They are supposed to be public officials working for us, not solely the betterment of corporations.
$C: >The Republicans know the public wants it.  They just don't care.

FTFY
$C: Yes, because sometimes politically versed professionals know more about politics than the public
$C: >They know the public wants it. They just don't ~~care.~~ pay as well as lobbyists.

FTFY
$C: Can we buy them? Start a go fund me for buying votes!
$C: Thanks, registering was easy.
$C: This! He has no real opinion on it so if it seems popular he’ll find a way to try to claim it. If that gets it passed great. He’s in over his head and people are going to figure out how to play him very soon. 
$C: Actually I think Ajit became next in line during obama
$C: [deleted]
$C: I kinda think us having an idiot president may help us here. He really seems to be the kind of person to do things because he knows people might like him more for it. Maybe this will be one of those times. 
$C: Obama appointed him... but keep on spouting shit from your mouth. 
$C: Then the repeal will still happen. 
$C: Trump was also opposed to intervention in foreign conflicts and cutting Medicaid, and supported raising taxes on the rich. How’s that worked out?
$C: Just out of curiosity, why?
$C: Why do you hate America, anyway?
$C: who?
$C: Be sure to remind them often or they might forget /s
$C: People down voting you haven't read some of the details of what net neutrality actually was. Smh 
$C: Back during the boston bombings Reddit witchhunted some random guy they thought was the bomber. He wasn't. It really fucked up his life just because a bunch of idiots on the internet thought he was a terrorist. 

The post where they "found" him began with the words, 
"We did it Reddit!"
$C: That's my life dude
$C: It's from eating a shit pie.
$C: The kind of smile you have after being runner-up in a shit eating contest.
$C: Hopefully he will be eating shit in prison soon
$C: Don't get too excited. We still have to win over the House and even if that somehow happens, 45 has to sign it in. 

Today was a good victory but we still have a way to go. 
$C: Fuck em.
$C: I wonder how Google, Facebook, reddit, Netflix, Amazon, etc. feel about how successful their donations were.
$C: In the long run, net neutrality is going to get gutted. We're just prolonging the inevitable. One way or another,  money demands that this will happen.
$C: God dammit fucking Doobs 
$C: his race doesnt matter at all

he is the definition of a cunt
$C: So it's political window dressing?  

The House has different rules and makeup than the Senate.  What possible path forward to getting a vote is there?

$C: Oh, good. We'll have them on record.
$C: I see a lot of refusals, so the weasels can try to play the voters and their primary base, the corporation.
$C: POTUS = President of the United States
$C: Open internet and Net Neutrality are mutually exclusive.
$C: That's the opposite of my understanding.
$C: Take a lesson from Andy Dufresne. Sent a letter a week until he got a response. So he started sending two a week.

Edit: I F and R are close
$C: I work for a Congressman (very close to Hunter’s district I might add) and, at least in our office, we read and log every single letter and call. The thing is, we get so much mail from constituents that it would be an extremely difficult, if not impossible, task to get everyone a personal response. If Hunter is anything like the Congressman I work for, he definitely hears everything that the district is saying, though whether he chooses to act upon it is up to him. 
$C: Unsure if mine was read or not, but my response back made it obvious that my representative was blatently ignoring the concern of people on this side of the fence.
$C: Thanks! I just realized how much complaining I do about our political system and how little I do to actually try and change it. I just started voting in all elections, even the tiny local ones a few years ago. At least I have the peace of mind of knowing I spoke my mind. 
$C: >if net neutrality is overturned on your watch you'll have my vote

You told your representative to vote against saving net neutrality?
$C: Haha, this is the best email, clear, honest, to the point! "You give me what I want, if not then I won't give you what you want." I think if I were a Representative and got enough of this type of email, I'd definitely start thinking about keeping net nuetrality. 
$C: Christ if you are a regular on Reddit that must have been a fucking big rock
$C: Yep lol. Surprisingly my senator voted against the party, Louisiana redditor here. Maybe my congressman might do the same. 
Edit:I’m dumb and posted incorrectly 
$C: Respectfully,  you don't owe them coffee. Great message , though.  Very eloquent,  logical,  and sussinct. 
$C: We actually work in the same building and have met several times. It actually would be a possibility. 
$C: Disregarding a well written letter because of a common phrase isn't edgy, it's stupid. While I am not religious and I notice religious phrasing, I don't let it affect my perception of the author's point.
$C: Understand that “pray” can be used in an entirely secular sense, it’s a formal preface to polite requests.

Don’t be a reddit asshole, there are so many as it is.
$C: I cut myself on that edge.
$C: Reddit is impowering. So true, I had no idea about this issue. Now I am ready to spread the word! Thanks everyone!!
$C: **Against:** As a general rule, regulations make business harder to run because they tie the hands of the internet companies. There are worlds you can imagine without Net Neutrality where the internet is actually a better place than it is now. For instance, T-mobile has a "binge-on" service that is arguably not neutral (it allows customers unlimited data for some websites, while counting data from other websites towards their data cap) but consumers actually like it because now the services that use most of their traffic are free (netflix, hulu, spotify, etc...). Allowing companies to fast-track or prefer certain websites can make being an ISP more financially viable (creating more quality tech jobs), and create a better experience for the customer so long as the company does not go too far and make the internet closed off to small businesses and opinions they don't like. The against crowd argues that with less regulation, smaller ISPs could start. They believe the smaller ISPs can provide competition to ensure the big guys don't only offer a censored version of the net (i.e. don't worry the market will take care of everything). Additionally, they believe smaller ISPs could start in less populated areas and provide better high speed internet there.

**For:** The internet is fundamentally a great equalizer of ideas and services. Preferred web traffic carries too great a risk at shutting down the little guy and essentially leaving us with a censored internet, or one in which small companies can't compete because they aren't willing or can't afford to pay the ISPs extra. We must make sure the internet stays neutral so that all ideas and content have the same priority, not just the ones that have the backing of the fattest wallets.
$C: The people against bet neutrality are retarded.  Everyone else is for. 

More specifically, the people against blindly support a “free market” without “government interference” and they see net neutrality as the government telling corporations what to do. 

A large number of people are also heavily influenced by Fox News, rush Limbaugh, etc which are extensions of the Republican Party that basically tell you what to think without explaining why, or come up with inaccurate portrayals to justify their opinions. (FN typically uses the former strategy, while Rush uses the latter.)
$C: [Well they're pretty damn silent then.](http://www.publicconsultation.org/united-states/overwhelming-bipartisan-majority-opposes-repealing-net-neutrality/)
$C: No, any pending legislation would expire at the end of the current Congress, i.e. January 2019. But the next Congress could legislatively repeal the rule, establish Net Neutrality as a matter of statute... there are a lot of options if Congress is willing to act.
$C: Depends if you like NN. Bad if you want NN. Good if you do not want NN.
$C: Yes. Vote for someone based entirely based off of one issue the other party voted against......
$C: This is the stupidest comment I've seen today so congrats 
$C: There are 3 who voted for NN and one who abstained (McCain who is doing his final term).

If you want to protect NN, you have to act like the NRA. Be organised and focused. Anyone who voted against your agenda must be punished and anyone who vote for your agenda, rewarded.

It worked for the NRA. This seems to be the only way to effective affect change in Washington. 
$C: If you want financial backers to decide what's important vote Republican, and if not vote anyone else.
$C: Here's the thing though. If they vote against a bill that is so obviously meant to support average americans, then you don't need to know a damn thing else about them. There are grey areas, where we disagree on what's best for the common person, and then there are black-and-white issues. This one is black-and-white. 
$C: He is still a coward though.

$C: The one that's surprising is Louisiana. Alaska and Maine are basically little universes unto their own, but Louisiana is typically synonymous with corruption. I don't know if it was genuine conviction or something ulterior, but it's unexpected to me.
$C: Totally agreed. I don't want to seem so partisan - there's plenty of stuff I don't like about the Democratic Party - and I really do want to give the GOP credit where they deserve it, but it's increasingly difficult for me. Why do you think Republicans are voting against Net Neutrality despite widespread support among their base? *Is it* partisan politics, or is it because they are in the pockets of special interest groups? 
$C: Modern Republican brand conservatism has two basic tenets:

1.) Money over people
2.) Being against whatever Democrats/liberals are for.

It's not a party of ideas, its a party full of reactionaries. 
$C: Yeah, partisan politics is bad when you disagree with it, lol
$C: What do conservatives do well?
$C: I'm hoping the movement to get money out of politics catches fire; 6 Democratic Senators have already pledged not to accept corporate PAC money, and there are a host of first-time candidates doing the same this election cycle.

I still don't think the parties are in agreement on taxes and government spending. There is undoubtedly overlap among the "moderate" members of the parties, but there are generally clear policy differences on taxes and government spending. Not sure about the War on Terror.
$C: ^ Found Ajit Pai!
$C: Retreat back into your stupid oversized coffee mug, Shit Pai.
$C: This is the truth... A majority of people have no idea what net nuetrality is but heard it's bad so they think likewise 
$C: I doubt it. If providers are going to start dividing the internet into packages, they will want to keep the base cost of the lowest package where the baseline is currently. They already have us by the balls, but the getting rid of the current rules will have them use their other hand to grab us around the throat.
$C: Kind of like your post?
$C: [deleted]
$C: I never looked at it that way but that's exactly what they are
$C: No, they just aren't as often gullible enough to vote on things based off misleading titles
$C: How'd you end up here from /r/The_Donald ?
$C: You honestly hate the government so much you trust companies like Comcast to be more consumer friendly?
$C: People would cancel their internet period.  The massive losses would put isp out of business super quick.  People also would simply use other devices as most if not all people have at least 2 options as they would have cell tower based internet and home internet which could be dsl, cable, or even satellite.  The key is that internet websites are the content that people want and if everything you want goes away then you don’t pay people for it.
$C: There's nothing stopping them from using their influence under the current rules to push smaller competitors out. Everyone is screaming about net neutrality but the real issue is the monopolies companies like comcast and spectrum have in their markets and the appalling level of customer service and shitty speeds and price gouging going on. 
$C: It wouldn’t.  No isp would dare do it.  And no one would pay for any isp that doesn’t have all the best sites.  It would be a unionization of websites and could be extremely powerful.
$C: YouTube and Netflix were getting throttled by virgin as one example.  Now they don’t throttle them but throttle other video providers after your “free” cap.  
$C: ISP are near death now
$C: It’s really not though. Regardless of who controls the house or senate you are still going to have moderates on both sides. This isn’t a win and frankly means nothing. The House will vote it down. And even if they do pass it Trump will likely veto. Granted a veto isn’t an end all be all to a bill - but in this case it’s dead in the water until at least midterms if the dems gain control of both. Even still - Trump vetos. But if there’s enough support congress could override a veto. This isn’t a win - it’s a statement. A statement the basically means nothing. 
$C: Your examples are bad, and I'll explain why.

Are gas and electricity necessary for survival? *Yes,* unless you are intentionally living off the grid they are. In a modern America, it is impossible to live without electricity and (depending on where you live and infrastructure) gas. 

You can also add water to this because water is also a utility. 

For instance, I live in New York. Without electricity or gas, people would die. They would be unable to heat their homes in the winter or cool them in the summer, they would be unable to cook any food whatsoever. Without water in the pipes they would die of disease from drinking dirty water, or thirst from not having water to drink at all. 

If you do not have electricity or gas or water, social services will likely take your children from you, for instance. 

But, someone may say, the internet is a luxury. But it isn't. 

Without the internet it is almost impossible to find a decent job, to apply for some services, to do homework, or to excel in school. For instance, students without internet at home tend to lag behind other students. There are socio-economic reasons for this, but it remains true. In NYC, for instance, it is nearly impossible for a student to research and apply to their high school (you have to apply to your high schools In NYC like a college) if choice, and this is part of the reason why NYC remains the most segregated school system in the country. 

But that's a very specific example. 

The fact is, regulating the internet as a utility helps the most vulnerable citizens.  A little over a hundred years ago only the wealthy had electricity, and it was seen as a luxury but today it is impossible to live in a city without it. 

The internet creates opportunities for work, for education, for advancement and people who do not have access to the internet struggle to live life in an ever increasingly technologically oriented world. 

By allowing companies to restrict access means that you are restricting the ability of an individual to function in several arenas. 
$C: My main issue with the whole thing is not intrinsic, it's the constant bullshit that the federal government does where they try to reinterpret 50-100 year old laws to fit something that absolutely does not apply to it.  As you said, i'm pretty hardcore libertarian so I'm *usually* against regulation in general, there are a few exceptions and utilities is one of them.

What they should REALLY be doing, and a few Republican senators have made this point, is rather than trying to shoehorn it like the Obama administration did under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act.

What *should* be happening is congress SHOULD be doing its effing job and legislating these things rather than forcing the executive branch to play ridiculous games and doing political gymnastics trying to find a "solution". Problem is Congress has been doing it's utmost best the past 75 or so years trying to pass the buck and give away as much power as it can to the executive branch because they're lazy (and a multitude of other reasons, but primarily lazy).
$C: I have to disagree with you on that. If this were 1996 then I'd say the standard of living wouldn't change much with or without individual Internet access. But it is so ingrained in society that it would be a pronounced step backward if any individual couldn't get their own personal Internet connection in their home and on their phone.

Water, electric and phone lines all fall into this category. Internet access should too. It is too important not to, and the infrastructure is too expensive to have real competition, same as water, electric and telephone.
$C: But both sides are equally bad! ^/s
$C: No one fucking knows what this is even about. 
$C: Collins, Kennedy, Murkowski. 
$C: Imma guess Collins was one of them.
$C: Some people reeeally hate abortion, and thus vote republican in order to stop abortions.
$C: Literally the only reason I would possibly support a Republican is guns and that’s not enough to justify all the bullshit they support. Plenty of the Republicans would happily enact their Protestant America where abortion, homosexuality don’t exist and where we screw over poor people . Economically not a democrat but they do support the oppressed people and people in general and the Republicans just don’t. 
$C: Low-information voters in red states. Their parents voted Republican, their neighbors vote Republican, and the people on TV, the radio, and the Russians on the internet tell them to vote Republican...
$C: Because Guns. Because People who espouse Gun Control are insane. Because I don't like the PC culture. Because several reasons. But if democrats dropped the whole gun control bullshit, lots of middle of the road people would be pushed more towards them. But Guns are too important for me and several of my friends for us to vote otherwise. Guns are a Right, the internet should be a utility, but still isn't a Right. I agree with Net Neutrality, in its entirety, but I don't think that boiling it down to Republican vs Democrat works, on a citizenry level atleast. It is clear that Republicans are getting checks from telecom companies, and lots of them believe that less regulation is better, and for some things that is correct, but for something as crucial and life altering as the Internet, it is important we have regulation that specifies it's importance in society. Guns however, are much more important, and why I will vote Republican or Libertarian.
$C: I don't see how anyone can vote for a Democrat unless you are mentally retarded. 
$C: >It's fair to say that members of both parties tend to be more interested in kickbacks and personal gain than in actually doing their jobs. It's fair to say both parties are full of slimy, corrupt individuals. It's fair to say that both parties have members who gravitate towards undesirable extremes. It's fair to point out that significant percentages of members of both parties are there because they're rich cunts and not because they're good at serving the public. It's fair to say both parties suck dick.

Bullshit. If that's the case why is it only the Democrats who side with us, the consumers, over Comcast? Why is it only the Democrats who side with the planet Earth over big oil companies? Why is it only the Democrats who side with patients over the insurance companies and pharma monopolies? Why is it only the Democrats who imposed Dodd-Frank wallstreet regulations? Why is it only the Democrats who have tried to hold Equifax and Wells Fargo accountable?

Yes, people try to lobby the Democrats and in some cases they may succeed. But, all in all, it is the Republicans and Libertarians who are under the thumb of massive corporations and the rich oligarchs who control them 99% of the time. You think Comcast hasn't tried to lobby the Democrats? They have. But ONLY the Democrats are still standing up for what we all know if right...
$C: Yep, I'm sure Democrats got plenty of ~~bribe~~ lobbying money from companies like Netflix and Google. In this case it happens to be good for us, but that's not why they voted for it.
$C: It's the part of the big content providers. That's all. 
$C: Lol. Explain why the GOP is literally (yes, literally) ALWAYS on the wrong side then? Literal garbage argument based in fiction.
$C: Fine, it will be one of many key issues that the voting public vote on. Also the amount of people who know what Net neutrality is has increased all the time....
$C: That logic is flawed. There hasnt been any legislation passed that hasnt souly come from the republicans. Also Trump has supported the FCCs ruling, sooooooo.....
$C: > pretty slim

A snowball's chance in hell.
$C: Trump can't veto it. Will source at a later date.
$C: Good ole corporate. If it wasn't for them the world would be a very different and less corrupt place
$C: Why?
$C: Ha! You really think Comcast would charge you less when you use less bandwidth? No. They'll just charge you the base rate, plus a Netflix fee, plus a Hulu fee, plus a YouTube fee. If you don't want to pay the fee, you can get 240p video at the base rate. 
$C: Fair point. Terrible delivery. 
$C: ok
$C: Lelevant username
$C: it's treason then
$C: General Misquoti!
$C: Theoretically you are correct but in reality you are way off base. There is no invisible hand of the free market coming to save the day for the internet unless it is title 2. 

Telecoms by and large are monopolies at this point. See Comcast and Time Warner attempted merger and AT&T and Time Warner current proposed merger for why the market is closed to new business. It’s not like some mom and pop ISP is coming in to smaller markets and displacing these giant corporations. Even municipal ISPs which in your scenario could be considered alternatives are being quashed by the major companies. Cities like Louisville, KY are trying to roll out broadband to their city that would be cheaper and better and are getting sued by the Telcos while facing an onslaught of lobbying money from Billionaires (Republicans). Hell even Google stopped rolling out Fiber because of these entrenched fucking shitheads.

Needless to say Title 2 looks like the only answer. It shouldn’t have to be because a Cogressional Act would be a long term solution but that will never happen again because, you guessed it, Republicans.
$C: Thanks for a fresh, intellectual take on it. While its good to have a lot of people behind saving it,  its better to have people like you who see it in whole. 
$C: If they were actually for a free market, then they would stop crushing municipalities that try to set up their own broad band.  Republicans have consistently squashed cities that set up their own fiber network or passed laws to prevent this. 

So yes, classifying ISPs as Title 2 isn't perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than the alternatives at this point.  
$C: Brevity is the soul of wit. Can you say that once more for twitter people?
$C: Which while those are problems have nothing to do with net neutrality. the comparison of ISPs to Websites is absurd.

Google can't prevent you from accessing another service, your ISP can.
$C: You think democrats don't get telecom donations?
$C: [ISPs have never attempted to abuse their power as a service provider in order to circumvent competition or to squeeze more money out of clients.](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7ju8mt/every_time_an_isp_attempted_to_throttle_or_block/)


$C: Why would the government need net neutrality to censor the internet? They control it regardless because they can cripple companies that don't cooperate and have done so in the past and probably present.  
$C: yes, because your statements and views are factually wrong.

>ISP has never done that and net neutrality does and means much more then that. 

yes they have jesus christ. multiple fucking times.

>Net neutrality gives the government control over all the internet since it would classify the internet as a utility and allows them to censor 

no it doesnt. stop spouting bullshit or provide the references to the rules and regulations from a primary source (read: from the FCC) that support this. hint: you won't find anything.


$C: So is this a short version of how the republicans and those wanting it discarded see it? 
$C: im gon“Na „ask how to play.... as luigi in sm64
$C: Replace them in the primaries next time.
$C: Whoops!  Means FCC.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Agreed!
$C: Just to be clear, that's one way they can use their power under the FCC's regulations but just because you don't see something that egregious, doesn't mean ISPs aren't undermining the neutrality of the internet. More imminent strategies are likely to be things like having different internet companies (e.g. Netflix, Spotify) pay the ISPs for fast lanes and they in turn will charge consumers for their services.

But it gets worse. 

NBC Universal is a partial owner of Hulu and also owns Comcast, one of the biggest ISPs in the US. They'd be able to legally give Hulu a fast lane for free what they would charge Netflix and HBO a lot of money to use -- or even say that consumers can only achieve advertised internet speeds by using their proprietary services.

Thanks for dumbing it down for a fellow simpleton. I get to write about this issue in my American Political System class soon. Much appreciation. So joy.
$C: Yes. It seemed to come out of nowhere, which I found odd. Then I got kicked off Twitter for trying to comfort seemingly distraught people, which was just stupid. I also keep getting different answers, when I ask what it is. I think you’re right, and I can confirm that the Internet was running just fine (with less censorship) before 2012. 
$C: Rules were instituted in 2015. Also, nobody thinks it will end the internet, but allow ISPs to charge you money for certain websites, throttle others, or shut off websites they don't like for whatever reason. I don't want Internet going the way of cable tv
$C: Hey, I'm really sorry. Didn't mean to offend you. I know some people can be really sensitive about these things, and I appreciate why. I had a lot going on at work today, so it wasn't at the front of my mind. Guess I wasn't at my best. I'm sorry.

But it's weird, because it matches exactly what the Vice page says. Which I think means the point I was making is 100% backed up, and now your point seems irrelevant.


Aww man, that sucks. I'm sorry. No hard feelings. I've been there; know how it feels. We've all said silly pointless things. Don't sweat it, it's no big deal. I don't think it speaks to who we really are. We just slip up sometimes. Hope you have a good morning.

$C: Can I ask what did he do that makes people so angry?
$C: Not true. There are some very smart ISP CEOs who oppose net neutrality because it limits how much they can assfuck the rest of us.
$C: Not really sure why you see the need to devolve this into a name calling contest just because someone could potentially have a different opinion than you.
$C: You sound like a moron yourself, because you can't even explain your position without acting like a moron.
$C: Certainly true. I just thought I would remind folks that Reddit is arguing their own selfish interest in this case. That's usually worth considering.
$C: I think you may want to take a look at the actual text of what you are supporting.  Just saying.  I read it
$C: Technically, that's not wrong, but, to my knowledge, without NN ISPs can decide which sites to block using arbitrary standards. In other words, if Comcast doesn't like what's in the data packets, they can choose to block them. So, it CAN be based on content alone.
$C: >Are you aware that net neutrality has nothing to do with content?

It would make sense that your very next sentence should not make the explicit contention that net neutrality is about content. And yet:

>It's about ISPs not being allowed to limit content based on prioritization.

You continue:

>It's about being neutral as to where the **data packets** come from. Not what's in the **data packets**.

I think you wanted to emphasize "where" and "what", but I digress. u/FreeSpeechWarrior 's point is supported by what you've said: NN would force ISP's to be neutral on all content. In the same way an electric company can't refuse to provide power to the local KKK chapter hangout, NN prevents ISPs from making decisions based on the content of a website.

So the (ignored) argument is thus: If it's ethically acceptable to force companies like Verizon and Comcast to behave neutrally regarding legal content over their networks, why is it ethically okay for reddit to not behave the same way regarding users? Is their relative importance to our day-to-day lives the deciding factor on why we have different standards for these large corporations? 
$C: This is literally the point of Capitalism and the free market. Companies will see this as an opportunity to steal unhappy Comcast users by providing better services that are more appealing. 
$C: > Are you aware that there's a difference between the government and a website?

I wasn't aware it was the government operating the ISPs. I stand corrected, I guess. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
$C: Maybe he meant metaphorical Nazism, or interpretive Nazism, or abstract Nazism. Anything but the literal kind, we all know that's the worst
$C: You are the one in need of a lesson:

Once an entity becomes "public" enough, free speech is demanded. So the Supreme Court says. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh_v._Alabama

"The court pointed out that the more an owner opens his property up to the public in general, the more his rights are circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who are invited in."

$C: Again, I'm pretty conflicted on the whole thing.

I'm very sympathetic to this argument because it's quite similar to my argument that taxation is theft.  While in theory you can leave, in practice it is impossible.

I didn't want to come out strongly for or against net neutrality here, only to say that reddit has absolutely no credibility on these matters.
$C: I can assure you that ISPs aren't strapped for cash, and they will nickle-and-dime consumers regardless of how much their services cost. The idea that these poor ISPs can't afford to provide internet service without being able to extract more money from consumers is ridiculous. Net neutrality doesn't cost ISPs money, they haven't even really taken advantage of the lack of it, ([though they have tried](https://np.reddit.com/r/KeepOurNetFree/comments/7ej1nd/fcc_unveils_its_plan_to_repeal_net_neutrality/dq5hlwd/?sh=45a33b81&st=JAA62V5F)). Even if the naiive assumption that consumers will save money from "reduced" operating costs from ISPs comes true, we will end up paying far more for a censored and cherry-picked selection of websites and paying to unlock gated-off websites than we ever have before.

Blocking off service to certain websites is anti-competitive, censors people's beliefs, and hurts the American people in every conceivable way.
$C: That’s crap. Reddit is text and links out to other sites. What the fuck are they “negotiating” for?  Faster text loading?  
$C: That happened? Wanna link me?

$C: Net Neutrality

the principle that Internet service providers should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source, and without favoring or blocking particular products or websites.

It's about being neutral to the data packets... It has nothing to do with the censoring. It's all about not allowing 'pay to play' for priority routing from the ISPs.

We pay an ISP to get data on the internet, we don't pay them to give us tiered access to that data.
$C: Nobody has ever gotten banned for this. It would be easily testable and there would be articles all over the place about it.
$C: > I think it's hilarious how politicians brand anything to be honest. 

Kind of like how Pai and his fellow Republicans called their ruling reversing net neutrality the "Restoring Internet Freedom Order"
$C: Jesus you people could not have bigger victim complexes or be bigger crybabies. 
$C: HAHA YES, THAT MUST BE TRUE DUE TO YOUR DELETED STUPID COMMENT!
$C: >The more I read about how it was written up the more I feel like I'm taking crazy pills


Undecided party here, can you elaborate?
$C: You’re welcome to leave anytime.
$C: It's not really liberal bullshit it's blatant propaganda.  Just ask yourself who owns reddit? Not who is the CEO but who is the largest shareholder on reddit? 
$C: [deleted]
$C: You understand this post was literally made by the admins? 
$C: Where in the NN language is it set up that one can lobby to take down individual content or websites? NN is about not having prioritization, right?
$C: You’re incredibly misinformed on the subject.
$C: Y-You do know your first sentence is literally the opposite of Net Neutrality, right? I think you might be a proponent of Net Neutrality, buddy. 
$C: ... what? Your definition of "Net Neutrality" is the exact opposite of what we are fighting for, if you want to view that Nazi webpage or even an ISIS site you can under NN rules, aka what Reddit wants, without NN they can throttle or even block sites they don't like. That cat video you enjoy? Blocked. That Nazi page how down The street visits? Blocked. Fox news? Loads in ~3 minutes just because someone paid the company, or the company decided. The government at that point can potentially even nudge the companies to block certain websites. Do your research better, you are siding with the wrong side. 
$C: So you would rather have the power to censor lie in money-hungry corperations that don't give a rats ass about your "anti-censorship" ideals than you would have it be protected by the government in a consumer protection law? And just because of a vague conspiracy theory about how the government is out to get you and they will somehow turn these protections into a completely unrelated and unrealistic conspiracy where they censor the internet? There is no basis for your reasoning in this other than your irrational fear of any common-sense government regulation.

Your idea of what is going to happen is literally the exact opposite of what it does? Your reasoning is literally just a slippery-slope fallacy.
$C: The funny thing is that all the slaves cheering for NN never knew shit about it till obama a few years ago. The internet was fine for decades before NN. The useful idiots who fake outrage and pretend we’re gonna die if we don’t have NN are to blame. They don’t understand what’s actually happening. Their brains are limited and can’t comprehend complex situations. They only go by what they’re told. 
$C: It's not necessarily an evil thing either. I just view it as a way of the government taking control of a part of the free market. Which has its pros and cons. I actually used to be a strong advocate for NN but after doing my own research outside of bias news sources on both sides my opinion changed. 
$C: Regulations have never benefited the consumer. Ever
$C: I don’t understand why you are being downvoted.  It’s the simple truth that all Democrats and 3 moderate Republicans got this passed.  All other Republicans voted against it.
$C: I thought that was the reason ajit pai repealed it in the first place?
$C: And then those people you speak of turn around and support government regulation of the internet under the flowery name of Net Neutrality, despite the facts.
$C: Yep, [no reasons](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/government-affairs/government-policy-issues/net-neutrality.html) are even conceivable besides "hurr Obama was a Muslim".
$C: I fucking do. I know of ***three*** rural broadband ISP start ups that died because of the proposed rules. They weren't even in place yet.

You fell for it hook, line, and sinker and made it harder to have consumer choice. Congrats.
$C: What did the ISPs do 
$C: Oh, enlighten me. Nobody was clamoring for this...ever. The internet has been getting better and better every year. Now it wil become a UTILITY?! Do you even have a clue what happened when the government stuck its nose into telecommunications systems? Decades of drudge and no innovations. Costs went up and up and service was awful. Once there was deregulation... the phone systems took off. Now we have cell phones and service everywhere etc. 
$C: Oh no, the poor companies. I wasn’t even thinking of them!
$C: I can't tell what the tone of this comment is, but I recognize the joke you made.
$C: You mean the Democrats that unanimously voted in favour of net-neutrality? What? 
$C: This kind of vitriolic attitude is a big part of the reason why this country is as divided and dysfunctional as it is. When the Republicans and Democrats manage to have a proper dialogue on an issue then we will have a good political atmosphere.
$C: *grabs popcorn 
$C: How about you go fuck yourself?
$C: No way in hell is he winning again. He is a global embarrassment. So are you. 
$C: Hah. See your ass on 2018 and 2020.
$C: I thought ISPs were immune to boycotts because they had complete control over their respective markets. Just repeating what I have seen on reddit.
$C: America is nothing but run by the 1% nowadays.
$C: I really hate how you are right about this. Still, I'm going to do what I can and try to vote them out.
$C: Yo! Klavan is the man and it makes me really happy to see someone outside of a right wing sub talk about him. I love his podcast. He has a humorous approach to politics that I just adore. 
$C: You got a title for that speech?
$C: I love Klavan my man. Thanks for having the balls to speak up in the face of adversity. 
$C: This is why Obama named it Net Neutrality. The name confuses the people who believe in the principle of net neutrality and don't actually understand what the Obama program actually does because they take it at face value.

Honestly ask yourself, do you really think trying to pigeon-hole the internet into the Communications Act of 1934 by declaring it a title II common carrier is going to actually work well?

Repealing it allows the FTC to reestablish jurisdiction over the internet where it can do it's job, which is protect consumers while the FCC does not have the capacity or means to do so.


$C: How, in the ever loving fuck, is ruling that the Federal Trade Commission, who's job it is to protect consumers should be in charge of this, instead of the FCC - who's job is to license the radio spectrum, and was expected to be unneeded as an entity as early as 2015 by Wired fucking magazine in 2003, anti-consumer?
$C: IRS targeting ood convert active groups. The government can be weaponised against you and there's nothing you can do about it, but you can always choose a different isp. 
$C: This entire term has been one big gift from the Republicans to mega-corporations like Comcast and Exxon. Stealing from the poor and giving to the rich. Trying their very best to take away healthcare and education. Trying to stop people from voting however possible so that they can continue to hold power. The Republicans are corrupt in every possible way; literally and morally.

It is the Democrats who, time and time again, clean up the messes left by the Republicans, and it is only the Democrats who stand up for consumers against big data, big oil, big gun, and wall street. It's always been clear that the Democrats are better for the average American, but it's never been clearer than this year.
$C: ...life finds a way...
$C: Nah it's a common expression. Doesn't have to be a dick or dildo. Ajit Pai can shove his proposed bill up his ass.
$C: Yikes this reply 
$C: Nah. 
$C: Actually, Net Neutrality laws are making it too expensive and too difficult for grassroots, independent ISP's to start up.

[Here's a pretty interesting article](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/one-big-reason-we-lack-internet-competition-starting-an-isp-is-really-hard/) on the costs associated with this. If we can remove and deregulate the oppressive NN laws, we can finally optimize this shit.
$C: He was appointed by a Democrat. 
$C: That'd be difficult to do due to sjw democrats getting on a lot of people's nerves, made me go republican in fact, despite hating them too, don't think there is such a thing as a good party, just less of 2 evils in each persons perspective.
$C: Stop voting for capitalists.
$C: Like that would happen if your smart and not a sjw you are most likely Republican now most mentally ill and stupid people follow the liberals.
$C: Pretty much everything except for the "don't discriminate traffic" part. I'd send some links, but it's 1am.
$C: What did you do?
$C: Actually they did do something. They repealed title 2. Or.. did you miss that?
$C: ELI5: Trump doesn't have to sign?
$C: I feel like he might have begun with that mentality, but felt butt-hurt when his obvious personal repulsiveness turned off democrats.  He's full-on republican base now, and they'll believe anything fox news tells them to.
$C: > I'm hopeful that he'll realize it would increase his approval rating if he let it through.

Keeping his campaign promises brings it down with the left, squashing TPP like Bernie would have done made it go down with the left, bringing together NK/SK for peace talks made it go down with the left. You people don't care what he does, you oppose him and /r/esist no matter what because you're partisan hacks. But now he should pander to your wants? Yeah, fuck off with that bullshit. 
$C: His approval rating is higher than Obama’s ever was. Thanks to Kanye West, black unemployment being the lowest it’s ever been, defeating Isis, bringing peace to NK while making them denuclearize, tax cuts, jobs out the ass, the returning of NK prisoners. His approval rating is stronger than ever and his base continues to grow rapidly. Once the DNC loses the black vote which they are in the process of they will be dead. They are already in debt due to Hillary robbing them. Also their only policy to run on is I HATE TRUMP and I HATE AMERICA. Good luck. 
$C: Why whould the potus care about some losers opinion on a website lmao
$C: [deleted]
$C: Holy shit how did you come up with such a sick burn!? Stick to Fox News and T_D trumptard.
$C: It's him and his party that's currently fucking over NN, so I think people have a right to be upset with him.
$C: Thats actually a fair point I didn't consider. 
$C: I think it honestly can come down to two things. Those companies in favor of, want to continue to have a hold on the market via oligopoly, those not probably can't stand up to competition At least thats how I see it.  
$C: Thanks for the correction. I made an assumption based on how my services were being treated. I also mentioned and quote "I know very little" as if that wasn't already an indication. Keep up the good work friend! 
$C: Hey, BlackSheepwNoSoul, just a quick heads-up:  
**beleive** is actually spelled **believe**. You can remember it by **i before e**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
$C: Thanks for the reply. I appreciate it. Likewise, I am glad someone is actually applying thought to whats going on. All I am trying to do is establish a dialogue, talk about these things because like I've mentioned, there is a lot of pages to the NN document to thoroughly grasp the full content of it all. 

I see where you're coming from and its easy for someone to misconstrue because of the fact there is a lot of controversy surrounding this topic, but I assure you that I am not trying to sway anyone as much as I am trying to understand where other people are coming from providing my own experience. Its just not clear to me whether or not people actually have a valid opinion versus buying into this hysteria. I think we will get this right as well, but I don't think NN is the way to go about it, personally, and no one has been able to change my mind or offer any alternatives. Its just an angry mob of people arguing over something they know nothing about. Including myself of course, meaning I don't know much about it as well, but I am not going to call anyone a "fucking shill" just because I don't agree with them, which I've come to discover over the years I've been alive that those kind of people often are the most ignorant and I won't give them the satisfaction of replying. I'll let them believe their right so they can continue to live their miserable lives and perhaps one day they will reflect on themselves and realize they're the reason behind their own burdens. 

I'm just a regular dude like most people and I don't have time to entertain anyone. I appreciate their passion, however, they ought to express it more healthier. This outrage is not getting anyone anywhere and to be honest, NN isn't a big deal, at least not to me, and I continue to care less about it because of all these cry babies that offer nothing to the discussion. Out of spite, I hope this vote gets to the house and passes just so the President can veto it in a poetic justice kinda way. 

With all of that being said - your assessment is actually pretty fair. Like, "Look what *could* happen after NN is repealed!" (I assumed it already was repealed and I was wrong). It makes sense, and its plausible because lets face it, I enjoy capitalism as much as the next guy, but there are a lot of greedy people out there where "enough" is just not enough so to speak. I have no evidence to support otherwise, but I would like to think that ISPs want NN to make it easier to maintain the control over prices of the service. I would also like to think on the flip side of that coin is that the repeal can being about expansion as well, bringing in more potential customers. My father lives in the middle of no where surrounded by 40 acres of land and hasn't seen a cable modem since he moved out of the city 15 years ago and after the announcement from the FCC about the repeal, Spectrum started laying down the lines in his area and now its just a matter of time waiting for National Grid to provide a power supply to make the connection. Its almost as if Spectrum accepted the fact that when/if the repeal goes into affect, they had to make the moves to have a hold in the market in my father's area. Which if thats the case, thats pretty smart on Spectrum. 

This much I know for sure and its what makes me scratch my head. I moved to Glendale AZ, which if you don't know, is a stones throw away from Phoenix. When I got there I was excited to learn that GF was IN Phoenix and I assumed would be available in Glendale. When I  arrived to Glendale GF wasn't there yet. I didn't care because I figured it would make its way there eventually. It never came and I never questioned it. Fast forward to today, NN becomes a house hold topic and it all started to make sense as to *why* it never came. I don't live in AZ anymore, so I can't say whether its there or not after all of this controversy, but it simply makes sense. I admit, however, like most people I have other pressing matters to worry about rather than researching the cause, effects, pros, and cons. I have done very little, but enough to get a general idea and honestly, theres not a whole lot thats consistent except for the crying and bitching about the aspects that don't affect the everyday consumer enough to cause an outrage. 

This logic is apparently worth belittling and god forbid I, or anyone, should challenge anything mainstream.   
$C: Nobody will pay more to use Google. It isnt worth it. Nobody will pay more to use Reddit, it isn't worth it. 

Remember when cable companies got insanley greedy and that started things like Satellite TV and now Hulu, Netflix, Slingbox? 

It's almost like when someone is overcharging you, others see a market opportunity to charge you less for superior service.
$C: But how much money have you paid in fees using pornhub, snapchat, etc. over the last decade? Or at least noticed any fuckery when it came to paying your bill? Assuming you've been paying for internet for 10 years. Not trying to be a dick about it because I don't you, but I'm genuinely curious if you (or anyone for that matter) has paid fees for visiting porn sites or using apps. 
$C: > despite the length of what you wrote, this much is evident.

Immediate downvote.

The rest of what you said just sounds like the same rehashed point I hear on here over and over, nothing more than conjecture, so actually it sounds to me like you don't know what you're talkin about and you're just parroting your betters.


 and it sounds like a very two-dimensional argument to begin with..you honestly think people wouldn't rage out if that happened and a change would be forced? You can fuck with a lot of things but you don't get away with fucking with porn and other internet services-people simply wouldn't take it.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Everything you just typed had nothing to do with you, the consumer. Let's just use your Netflix example. You know why you'd pay more? Because Netflix would pass their costs of chewing up bandwidth to you so they can still churn a profit. Without NN, they wouldn't have their sweetheart deal with the 1 carrier everyone has a choice from in the area. 


NN is nothing more than a red herring to make you side with one side of this battle. 

This entire fight was between one side of corporate entities who want to keep their costs down and the other side of corporate entities who want to be able to charge them more. 
$C: Thanks for the reply. The thing for me is *how* exactly? Simply just making these company transfer data at the same rate? Then whats the sense? The only benefit is that all data is treated without prejudice, and potentially the price. Other than that, as far as quality is concerned, you may or may not be getting what you paid for. 
$C: So feeling skeptical about NN is now shilling? Got it, thanks. Also, assuming that an average person cannot read what VPNs and DNS' are and how they work is ignorant. Perhaps thats why I mentioned it? So people can ask themselves questions and maybe learn something? Or is that shilling too? You make it sound like I am expecting people to host their own VPN. If Netflix is blocking VPNs, have you considered not using Netflix? "Why do they need to the right to this" you ask? Well, why pay for a service that wouldn't allow you to use a VPN service for the sake of privacy? Oh right, that kind of logic is shilling. I guess there aren't any alternatives to Netflix or Hulu, I forgot. You seem like a real dick, but maybe you're not. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt because you do have a fair assessment, however, nothing you mentioned is applicable to how I use the internet, not to say that you should agree with it or be forced to change your habits, but that also doesn't mean you have any moral high ground either and you should consider that not everyone *wants* NN and it should be respected, just like I respect those that are in favor for it. I just want to know why. 
$C: Uh yeah... my grandma does. Lmao.
$C: Thanks for the reply and actually contributing something to the discussion thats worth reviewing. I'll give it a look. =)  
$C: Whether or not you can build a modem (what a waste of time, by the way) has nothing to do with your ability to understand how the internet works or how you want it to work.

Also he straight up said he didn't know what he's talking about. Maybe that should make you reconsider
$C: Thanks.

$C: Because you just created a third layer of approval to run 1 foot of fiber. 3 rural broadband companies I was consulting for died with just the proposal of the new rules. Thanks for passing on their grave and making sure Comcast is the only option for thousands of customers.
$C: He was humble enough to admit ignorance and you attack him?

What a clown. Immediate downvote.
$C: I like to provide a substantial amount content so that the reader can understand from my perspective so it could either be questioned or relatable. Plus it also catches the eye, but you seem like the type that cares more about being a faggot than actually contributing to a discussion and sharing ideas. For that, yeah, I probably wouldn't care much for what you have to offer. That and you're obviously too busy on the phone, but had just enough time to write an in-depth response to insult me. The fact that you turned my idea/opinion about something, and immediately retorted to insults says a lot about your character, or lack there of. People like you are the reason why people like me are skeptical and you're not doing anything for your cause by acting like a miserable fuck. Also, I fail to see the relevance of mentioning t_d and other conservative talking heads, but then again, you are just a dickhead after all and you clearly have a one way thought process- just like them. Good work! You are what you hate.   
$C: well he is playing the devils advocate, even if he's a shill
$C: Nice. 
$C: [citation needed]
$C: a current example may be pot laws.  each state is now legalizing pot to one degree or another - while it's still a federal issue which is not being enforced.  nn may become similar... where the feds keep laws on the books that every state knows to wink and nod won't bite them.  when enough states legalize pot the feds may turn over enough to legalize it too - same may happen with nn after 2020.  bottom line is as long as nn's return is potentially lurking "around the corner" of the next election cycle - cable/telco's won't invest much in exploiting the lack of nn - so as i originally stated, what's important NOW is that more states do as much nn legislation as they can get away with without getting their ass sued by the feds or the cable/telcos.
$C: Yea im sure.
$C: Im sorry but thats a lie. If i go over to r/conservative and try to debate theyll ban me or anyone else who tries. Same on the red pill or the donald. Its a fucking joke. There are entire subs on this site devoted to racism and sexism. No anti trump site would allow those things, thats just a fact. This site is not anti trump. 

And yes i am on r/politics and you are right about that sub it is left leaning. And there are a ton of bots that spam pro trump stuff. Just set the filter to new and see for yourself. 
$C: From a couple weeks ago there was an announcement about more Russian bots on politicalhumor than on other subs that were alleged to be filled with Russian bots

$C: This just in: Robert Mueller indicts 53 million people for conspiring to elect President Trump
$C: 13 trolls? I can count more in this thread alone, including you
$C: Says the trump voter.
$C: Only on r/politics or other liberal subs. And that ignores the dozens of posts that get posted, again, from day old accounts or at specific times durimg the day. 
$C: She definitely voted against this.

And like I said she has been pretty fucking terrible lately. She doesn't have my vote again after Devos and the Tax bill. But at least on the issue of NN she has kept her word. She was the first to announce her decision to cross the aisle back in January. So she deserves a little credit. Hopefully she'll be replaced and her last few months will be better because the GOP screwed her on the Tax bill by making her promises they backtracked on. Just hoping she learned her lesson that her party doesn't give a fuck about her or her state.
$C: What's wrong with Betsy Devos?
$C: > This simply means that internet service providers can't discriminate content and police everything

Who enforces that? 
$C: I think John Oliver video is overly simplified, not "politically extremist," but your breakdown is fair.
$C: Try again, but this time, actually think before you speak.
$C: You have zero understanding of what NN is.
$C: John Oliver is incapable of explaining anything without an extreme left editorializing of the subject.
$C: That was hilariously informative. That reminded me of the Daily Show with Jon Stewart, but with a British accent. 
$C: \>using John Oliver as a response to "spoonfeed it to me like I'm eight"
$C: Elaborate, please.
$C: Yes, it does, as the current template prohibits "throttling" of data even if your plan limit is exceeded.  Data is to be treated the same regardless of amount.  Also, advertising of different speed packages would be prohibited.  If grandma only wants 3.0MB DSL, then too bad because you can't offer "discriminatory" speed packages.  The devil is in the details on any legislation and too many people just don't care to find them out.
$C: > If you think Net Neutrality is...

> Without net neutrality the net...

You did the thing.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Net Neutrality is Google, Netflix, and Amazon vs Comcast and Time Warner.   

It’s corporations all the way down.  
$C: NN is going to create government controlled monopolies. It's definitely not the opposite. 
$C: WTF?  You mean all these posts doings exactly what reddit admins want isn't /r/HailCorporate?  I think you have been so brainwashed by media that you don't realize net nuetrality has winners and losers among corporations.  It's not simply corporations versus the people like you apparently believe.  I'm seriously triggered you didn't realize reddit materially benefits from this vote, it shows the ignorance revolving around the issue.
$C: ya, reddit is totally a small business!  LAUGH OUT LOUD CRYING EMOJI FACE
$C: Yeah, the kind of government involvement that benefits the American people. Trust me, there's no such thing as the "free market" in America. Big business gets the biggest subsidies going...and then they cry foul. You know...that whole, "I got mine, I don't give a fuck about yours" mentality.

I disagree with your opinion. If you vote against Net Neutrality...you're a dope.
$C: Ah, gee, I guess you win! Lol. (Nope.)

CHAMPAGNE.

THERE, FTFY. Posting a misspelled word while tired, working the end of a 13 hour day, doesn't make me incorrect on my argument.

Now tell me how you want President Trump to control your Internet. Hm. I am starting to see an upside to government overreach!
$C: And good for them. They’re a minority in an otherwise group of corrupt individuals that have their votes bought out. 
$C: > three republican senators chose to stick out from the group and vote for net neutrality.

they didnt stick it out.

they probably collaborated like the betsy devos vote.

if it fails in the house or trump, we would know that this vote is purely for show. they just using as political points for the mid term election.
$C: Because the internet has changed in the last 20 years. It’s no longer the wild wasteland it used to be and it could very well now be controlled by a handful of large corporations without net neutrality. That’s why it’s such a big deal. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Not quite the same thing, but I will bite. How happy will you be when you are tools you only need 15 mbs available to you. Or that you are only allowed that  download/ upload speed. Companies strive to give better products to outsell other companies. The government didn't put fiber in the ground. Companies wanting to give better internet service did that. 
$C: Those are laws telling what not to do, mostly in the name of safety. Not the same thing.
$C: Lol fuck off
$C: You knew that point i was making you didnt have to reply just to put me down so just fuck off back to something else.
$C: I do not like how Net Neutrality restricts ISPs from providing superior service. What of I WANT to pirchase a premium Netflix package, where I pay half as much a month, but only get Netflix? As it stands of I want to pay less for internet, I have to get inferior speeds.
$C: delete
$C: How is that relevant...?
$C: Very close. Other than Susan Collins, John Kennedy, and Lisa Murkowski, all Republicans voted against and all Democrats voted for. Dems were 49-0 for and reps were 47-3 against.

/u/Cygnus__A
$C: Hopefully Trump stops it.
$C: Oh right John McCain
$C: Shit. You’re right. I forgot about the three. My bad. 
$C: There is no evidence of this actually happening. People want to enact NN based on hypothetical situations. Most of the stuff people claim that NN protects from is still illegal under other regulations.
$C: Thanks man that really helps me understand American politics more!
$C: AND WHY IS IT SO INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO START UP AN INTERNET COMPANY???

An overregulated market that stifles competition.  Which Net Neutrality only creates more of.

You know what protects the consumer?  Competition.  Options.  You know what creates competition?  Deregulation that lowers the barrier to entry to attainable levels.

All internet companies piggyback off the same infrastructure backbone, so don't come at me with that "laying the cables" crap.  Unless you're running new infrastructure like fiber, it's a matter of switches and access points.  And even the upgraded infrastructure only has to be laid in certain places.  Internet startups are held up by regulations written by the telecoms specifically to prevent new startups.  Net Neutrality follows in the footsteps of that exact model while simultaneously surrendering the sovereignty of our access to global information highways.
$C: Not as Chairman. FCC rules are that of the 5 Commissioners, only 3 can be from the same political party.  The President always appoints someone from his own party, with his own ideology to the Chair.  
$C: Haha, yea that what I was thinking too. Was hoping there was a better reason.....  Pathetic
$C: Hell yeah
$C: Wait but why doesn’t amazon sell a box of cereal for 50$?
$C: So wouldn't a better solution be that there should be rules set in place to allow the "last mile" to customers homes to be leased by new companies?.  Worked great in Canada where smaller ISPs popped up everywhere and started plans with unlimited downloads without having to lay down wires.  I think in areas where true monopolies exist such as this, they should increase competition on the front end service to customers.

The literal easiest way to explain this is if NN falls, your internet could go exactly like the package deals for TV.


$C: Paying an Internet Service Provider for providing an Internet Service is not subsidizing a website. 
$C: Nothing stopping that person from buying less bandwidth. 

She'd buy a few mbps on the cheap, and the person wanting to stream and download everything wouldbuy a gigabit connection for more. 

That's allowed with NN. 
$C: While patting themselves on the back for a vote that would have turned out /exactly/ the same without a single phonecall.  

Except for [Murkowski](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/83b6qr/i_wrote_to_sen_lisa_murkowski_in_regards_to_net/), I suppose a phone call or two in Alaska may be a pretty big deal.

$C: Hasn't been dissolved? What? Then what do you think this Senate vote was all about? 
$C: I read it. I mean, he’s probably not too happy about how it’s going so far.
$C: And here I thought Net Neutrality was started during the Obama era.  So if this has been a thing since 2005, then how come the incident with Comcast and Netflix went on around 2013-2014.. where Comcast throttled Netflix until they paid?

https://consumerist.com/2014/02/23/netflix-agrees-to-pay-comcast-to-end-slowdown/

If Net Neutrality has been a thing since 2005.. wouldn't it prevent something like this?
$C: That's still just giving the government more power. We should work on removing the government created monopolies by freeing the market, not making it more difficult to be an isp 
$C: If Chuck Schumer is for it, I'm against it. I don't trust him or any Democrat, and they are all for it, including low IQ republicans like Susan Collins, et al. 
It's got the stink of gov't all over it but for some reason you can't smell it.
$C: looool, you don't know how legislature works, do you?

Read the article, the (D) Senator literally quotes the situation as "frustrating because it's a law the President will never sign".


$C: and once it passes? people will vote to ban pot temporarily again, 'till the next vote?

Is it just me, or is this a stupid system? We could be voting on net neutrality and pot for years to come.
$C: So you mean to tell me that you want to get something to go away that you haven’t even seen if it will work or not? Maybe you’ll like it better...

$C: That worst case scenario is an image of low-cost plans. i.e. options for those who cannot afford or do not want/need a large data plan. It's a misleading image, because it portrays plans meant for a niche market -- which make sense in that market -- as a nickle-and-dime scheme that everyone is forced into.
$C: >You are completely right. All these dumb fucks in here don't understand that net neutrality will hinder net progression. If we had net neutrality in the early 2000s, everyone would most likely still be using dial up internet.

This is next level stupid, and doesn't really warrant a legitimate response.

>Big profits for the big corporations means bigger and better infrastructure (fiber, etc).

Yes, all hail the corporate overlords.  Please build fiber in my area.  I mean, I already payed you for it with my tax money, and then you kindly told us to fuck off instead, but I still believe in you.
$C: > If we had net neutrality in the early 2000s,

we did thats what allowed sites to grow. 

>the big corporations means bigger and better infrastructure (fiber, etc). Which means us as consumers win (even if it means paying a little bit more for faster and better service).

The United States gave $200 billion dollars in taxes to these corporations for nationwide fiber and they did fuckall with it 
$C: > If we had net neutrality in the early 2000s

You literally had NN in the early 2000s! NN was being enforced under various laws since at least the 1980s. Why are you guys so much full of misinformation?
$C: > The free market is currently an anti-consumerist country wide monopoly, so...

Yeah... way scarier...
$C: You’re a fucking statist clown. I don’t recall a time when a business put people in concentration/internment camps or gulags and killed hundreds of millions for not purchasing their product. Fuck right off.
$C: You are right. America exists bc we fled the corporations back in England.
$C: Guess where the commenter posts often then try to figure out whether he gives a flying rat's ass.
$C: It's within a company's best interest to not be a piece of shit to their customers, out of fear of losing customers. If your provider is being shitty, get another provider. Competition solves this issue.
$C: Yet so far nothing has happened 
$C: > If you look into this more you'll find it did exist before then, but was handled on a case by case basis.

So it was already being handled without Net Neutrality in place? You're making my argument for me.
$C: Definitely trying to mislead others.  This is the same kind of disenginuous shitposting as pointing out Democrats started the KKK or supported slavery back when they were the conservative party.  OP KNOWS that NN was part of the internet since day 1, just pretends not to to attempt to build a narrative for more ignorant people.  Why?  Because some time long ago OP was an ignorant person who fell for the misinforming shitpost of some other OP, and now he has become so invested in his new reality that questioning it would be the same as questioning his own existence, so instead he doubles down in the hopes that by convincing others of his bullshit, maybe one day he can truly convince himself.
$C: If you voted Republican, then you were, by definition, for the repeal.
$C: Reddit was instrumental in getting him elected and his admin repealed net neutrality. If anything subs like the donald made this worse not better. And lets not forget that reddit hasnt addressed the russian bots in our midst, not really. Why havent the heads of reddit been in front of congress despite admitting to the same russian influ3nce that affected facebook. 

I know this comment gets seen by everyone and people will brigade me and downvote me. 

You can bring a bullet, a score, a morgue, but you cant bring the truth. Downvote away. 
$C: You mean under 60 then.


$C: 1. I didnt say everyone here loves trump. 

2. It is not a bipartisan issue and ill explain why. Republicans have never been pro net neutrality. Never. If you care about this issue the only people who will listen are dems and maybe 3 republicans. Its not a bipartisan issuem if you voted for republicans and thought theyd protect net neutrality you arent paying attention. 

3. Reddit blew up yes, but again, the platform was used during the 2016 election by russians to twist people into voting for trump. That can be found in the senate intel committees report. 

4. Where did i whine because my candidate didnt win? 
$C: Seriously i responded half an hour ago. I want an answer. If you cared enough to leave this comment then refute my response. If you dont i csn only assume youre not arguing in good faith. 
$C: I noticed you didnt actually argued with me just attacked me. Logical fallacy.

Authoritarian liberals like the OP really have no leg to stand on posing as crusaders for "internet freedom" until they unban FatPeopleHate, AltRight, European UncensoredNews, Physical\_Removal, and so on and so forth.
$C: Ah, the old "everyone whose views and actions aren't entirely in line with my own is a Nazi". And here I was hoping it was an isolated phenomenon.
$C: I agree to a degree, but that's a bit of a leap...
$C: That’s not the irony, I agree with you. The irony is that net neutrality legalizes and enacts the government to do exactly what Snowden was whistleblowing on. The government has to monitor all internet activity to keep ISPs in check, you don’t think that can lead to abuse, especially given our government’s past? 
$C: They like "Free" Markets, as in Free to fuck over the Consumer.
$C: Come on now. There is nothing free from outside influences. 
$C: Lol government protecting freedom is a perfect oxymoron as it is, but government protecting freedom via regulation is just hysterically nonsensical. Protecting freedom by restricting what you're allowed to do. The shit you hear on reddit, I swear. 
$C: He said he supports them, that means supporting his policies. 
$C: I meant unelected Bureaucrats
$C: She isn't up for reelection until 2020.  This probably wasn't some political pandering vote to get reelected.  She has supported net neutrality going back a while.

While I probably won't be able to get over the tax vote, you gotta give them props when they make the right vote.
$C: Since you are a bot you should be able to read this.

$C: It will be taxed, & it will be controlled....book it Danno!
$C: You will only get innovation if it remains profitable. Would you spend  or invest money to lose money?
$C: Fucc
$C: Marvelous 😑. Well, let's just pray (work) it does pass 
$C: So your solution is to relinquish control to government to solve this "equality" issue? Who decides what companies are allowed to conduct business in these so called areas? The lowest bidder? The best lobbyists? Who? Sorry but to designate government as the savior imo is not the answer. My internet is great and we only have two carriers who battle relentlessly. Not sure if you want government to choose your best provider. It's a terrible idea especially if Democrats are behind it. Should I say the Reinvestment Act or maybe Dodd Franks Act or maybe the great idea to repeal the Glass Steagall Act. 
$C: While that might be the case for non suburban areas, that’s not true for big cities. The 1984 cable communications policy act gave power to cities/counties to decide which ISP has access to certain areas. Which leads to crony capitalism (highest bidder gets the area) which is a result of government regulation. Comcast, google fiber, att, Verizon, xfinity, time warner cable, Cox etc. there are TONs of large companies with the funds to invest in other areas and provide competition but regulation is hindering them.  This is why I don’t think government shouldnt have any say in what happens to our internet. Companies could charge 500$ a minute of usage if they wanted to but they don’t because they’re not idiots. They want to continue making a profit and if they charge obscene amounts people won’t be able to afford it.  Repealing NN would allow an ISP to provide a “high data package” at a higher premium. Example, I game a good bit and would absolutely pay extra for my packets of data to be higher priority then my grandparents sending an email at a reduced rate. Can you imagine no buffering at 5pm when everyone gets home from work? Or 1-2 png always in gaming? Those are the doors that are opened when regulation is removed. You absolutely do not have to agree with my conclusion but please do research and understand the facts before making a decision. 
$C: So you ignore what the experts say, and you think you're right?  

Wow...

You are a useful idiot for the big corporations that are supporting net neutrality regulations.  
$C: Indeed, reddit regularly bandwagons onto the popular opinion instead of the correct opinion.  This is one of them.  

I take it you didn't watch the video because it was boring?  LOL!  

Facts, so boring...

$C: /r/soviet_reddit 
$C: Communism is when governments do stuff that the free market could do better. Net neutrality is the perfect example of this; by letting companies better charge websites that unfairly use high amounts of bandwidth they can make websites that use lower amounts of bandwidth cheaper to use for consumers.
$C: It's a meme you dip
$C: [deleted]
$C: I’m playing around dude 
$C: Nope, I live in an area with multiple choices: Comcast, Frontier, Spectrum
$C: Who am I repeating? I haven't heard anyone with my opinion on the matter.  To me i just don't want government regulating every thing.  Some things, yes.  But not everything, and not this.
$C: Thank you! 
$C: Just did. Fuck you!
$C: I worry about both companies and the government. It’s just that the government has bigger guns.
$C: Do you remember the Internet before 2015? When net neutrality laws were passed nothing changed. Also I’m certain net neutrality repeal will fail in the house so by the end of the year I assure the Internet will stay the same.
$C: Super informative. Thank you.
$C: I don't even pay attention to what's in the media. But since when has this regarded the media? Should I have to pay for Your Netflix addiction? NO. So repeal this stupid shit and let prices work. 
$C: Let me rephrase that. I hate the Reddit hive mind and the idea that you think you've done anything. 
$C: You are correct the cost is very high. The reason it is high is because current ISPs have lobbied the government to pass laws creating "barriers to entry" in the ISP field. Current ISP legislation is a bandaid on a larger wound. If we deregulate (i know scary) what a company must do in order to compete, then more firms will enter the market.

Some firms will be greedy and have high prices. these are the scary bad guys. Comcast REEEEEE etc.

Some firms will only be in small areas because they are new, and they can offer lower prices for a slower internet speed. but hey, if im not uploading youtube videos and I don't watch netflix, i can pay a cheaper price. sweeet.

The smaller company gains a profit and can then expand their cheaper service to more people. We saw this in the phone industry after the 1990s. Phone companies kept changing ownership and going out of business. Now we have Metro PCS and other cheap alternatives to compliment Verizon etc. You can scoff at Metro PCS, but it provides a form of communication for millions of humans for a smaller cost which is vital in our smaller incomes, and allows us to save more money for other needs. 

Tl;dr: We should seek an isp market that encourages multiple firms, so that if one firm misbehaves, people can jump ship to the other services, and the bad firm will be punished monetarily for their poor policies. That would be a neutral internet, not making it more like a utility, which is a textbook definition of a monopoly. 
$C: lol
$C: He probably thinks it's a-okay for ISPs to charge extra for Netflix since he doesn't use it. Jokes on him when access to Infowars cost $10/month. 
$C: Spoken like a true Commie.

Fidel would be proud, which I’m sure tickles you Pinko.
$C: So T-mobile's, doesn't discriminate again data? they literally let all the data through if it comes from giant companies like Youtube or Netflix but restricts my access to data from other sources (after your plans allotted data of course.) Please tell me one merger that was prevented as of a result of the 2015 rules. Most people saw no increase in competition, worse some people even lose ISP choice. 
I know my argument isn't very nuanced but I am not stupid, this is Reddit people will downvote me regardless of the facts cited. I have gone into detail on this in the past, people don't read they want the TLDR and the lies both parties tell on the subject can't be reduced down to a tweet. 
$C: Don't really see how the 2015 rules stopped this, most of the examples never came to fruition, some even had heavy public backlash. I am not a layer so the legalnesse may have gone over my head. Thanks for the reading material. 
$C: So you want to pay more money for internet to get less out of it? That makes zero sense
$C: We shouldn't have any of it. The fact is, this just showed the FCC that you would rather have them heavily regulating the internet and what you get from it because a few democrats and large tech companies told you a horror story of what could happen should you get rid of it. And it doesn't matter if it's an ISP or not. It hampers innovation and therefore the rest of the tech Industry because most of the way we live now revolves around the internet. We need more capitalism not less. Net Neutrality isn't representative of a free market. 
$C: You are joking right ? I'm from New Orleans and I live in Florida . 
$C: Neat. Now find a new refrain.
$C: Nowhere. I actually know what the fuck net neutrality includes. So instead of calling it horseshit, try arguing the points or refuting them with points because everything I said is fact. The fundamental aspect of Net Neutrality is that ISPs are not allowed to discriminate bits of data. They can't discriminate based on where they're from, what site they're from, what their purpose is, what protocol they use nor what they contain. All bits must be treated equally on the ISP's end, meaning a gif on a webpage has just as much priority as your command to the server that you're firing at someone. 

Obviously, some servers run at different speeds meaning that certain websites are going to run faster than others and your router will try to prioritize certain traffic you tell it to prioritize by telling it to ignore this other data until after this data, but your ISP is not allowed to manipulate traffic speeds itself based on the type of traffic.

Those are absolute facts.
$C: Check the post history. Person might actually be clinically retarded
$C: They probably have no idea what NN even is and just think it's bad because Republicans say it's bad
$C: No, net neutrality means a neutralized Internet. Sorry they lied to you. 

The Internet was fine before net neutrality was introduced in 2015.then it became censorship heavy on conservatives
$C: No, I’m new to the internet.  
$C: Are you a fucking moron? Clearly that’s BAD. Also, you shouldn’t say one-word sentences (without any punctuation, might I add) like that. It makes you look primitive and stupid.
$C: Hey, pandalovestacos, just a quick heads-up:  
**belive** is actually spelled **believe**. You can remember it by **i before e**.  
Have a nice day!

$C: Presumably they're worried about fatigue. If they spread out the calls to activim, they might not get as strong of a response.

I agree w/ you btw
$C: As a conservative republican, i find it disappointing that so many republican representatives oppose net neutrality. We are supposed to be champions of the open market, and the internet itself has BECOME the open market. Conservatives need to examine their views instead of just falling with party lines. BAD!
$C: A bit of an extreme stance to take imo considering we don't even know who's running...
$C: Here are the people who need to be voted out:


https://gizmodo-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/gizmodo.com/heres-the-name-of-every-senator-who-voted-against-net-n-1826085987/amp
$C: This is how you properly politics. Everyone take note.
$C: Well said 
$C: Agree
$C: So I asked this question on this thread earlier, but it got d ownvoted and ignored.

What happens if this hits Trump's desk. I don't think there's any way that this can beat a veto.
$C: Seriously, this. For the bill to pass in the House, we would need to flip more than 22 votes on the Republican side.
$C: If you want to win this, comments like "Trump's bullshit" are just stupid and counterproductive.  Don't  disenfranchise half the country and turn this into a Dem vs Republican issue.
$C: I gave this all my upvotes just now! 
$C: I want to Call to Action your comment to say “mic drop”! Well said!
$C: From what I've gathered, any correspondence longer than "please support/oppose (issue)" is wasted effort. An intern will scan the letter or listen to your call and put a tally mark on the day's whiteboard. So your support or opposition is recorded, but your threat to vote against them, or your long and well-thought-out argument is never conveyed to the elected official.

Can anyone with inside knowledge comment if this is accurate?
$C: It's true, but I find it sad and confusing that my fellow conservatives don't want net neutrality. We are supposed to be about freedom, even on the internet. 
$C: A reddit call to action? Isnt that thing for quite some time been corporate influence in politics is bad?
$C: I'm pretty sure 77% of republicans are against NN repeal.

If untrue, you should know that at least one republican supports you guys, me. 
$C: Agreed
$C: Wzswwaassassss
$C: Net neutrality was part of Obama using the nsa to spy on all Americans! 
$C: Lp.org
$C: This is a situation where you want to phrase it as a carrot rather than a stick, though. Republican politicians don't seem to be fully aware that this is a high-priority, nonpartisan issue for voters. They're likely to assume that anyone who cares a lot about NN wasn't going to vote for them anyway.

So the message you want to send, if you can say it with a straight face, is something along the lines of "I *want* to vote for you in November, but I *can only do that* if you support Net Neutrality."
$C: ...Really? *This* is the issue we use to make or break a representative? Not free-at-use healthcare for all? Not higher wages and restrictions on the rich? Not ending jingoistic imperial practices around the world? Not reforming the electoral system to create more diversity and less corruption in our elections? Not destroying the private prison system which exists as a means of legally perpetuating slave labor? Reigning in corporations and monopolies? Protecting workers' rights, and perhaps even giving them democracy in the workplace by law? Creating a Universal Basic Income and insuring nobody in this nation is ever without food or shelter again? Investing in public education again? Moving toward renewable energies and destroying the fossil fuel industry? 

I like net neutrality too. It's important to me. But we can't even BEGIN to fix the threat to net neutrality until we fix other MAJOR aspects of our system. The internet is one of MANY services which should be public but is threatened by privatization, we have to outlaw ALL privatization of essential services. The internet alone cannot be the single issue we threaten over.
$C: Oak Nuggins. 
$C: Exactly because there's zero chance to pass the House and if then Trump has to sign off. What happens when we multiply by (zero)2?
$C: [deleted]
$C: Exactly. I am at the point where I am telling these people that if they don't vote for net neutrality I will not vote for them. I even went as far as to call out those who didn't vote and praise those who did to drive the point across. It's best to protest and praise for now so that the house and the president see that we mean business and also know that if they save net neutrality approval ratings will go up. If there is a vote for senators before midterms then we should keep those in power that are willing to listen to the people and fire those who don't want to do their job.

$C: The entire house is not up for re-election this year. What are you talking about?
$C: Boo.  We can wait to start a fuss about it.  Because net neutrality is bull shit to begin with.   

How people don’t get that getting the govt out of this industry is better, I’ll never understand.  Actually out, not keep enough that it props up monopolies.  Remove the govt barrier and let them soar.  We’ll all be much better off. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: eh,so you think the 1st,4th and 2nd ammendment is worth giving up just so you can keep a free and open internet(even though we'd have even more censorship with a democrat,guess you wernt paying attention to stuff when obama was president) or did you not factor that in your party loses seats in the midterms point
$C: End “net neutrality” now! End internet monopolies!
$C: The blue wave is shaping up to be a disappointment, yet again, but at least this time you're hardened.
$C: I don't believe the Blue Wave shit. Remember how everyone said that shit about Trump never being able to win? It's gonna be the same way, Republicans and Democrats are gonna more or less stay where they are.
$C: I read somewhere that the best way to get a representative’s ear is by legally bribing them through campaign contributions.

Source: every politician

/s (but not really) :(
$C: Absolutely. I’ve worked in three offices (two reps and one senator), and *anything* in the news with the representative’s name in it was marked with a big PRIORITY and put in a separate pile from all the other news clips. Most reps read all the clips they’re given to begin with, which means an Op-ed with their name in it is *definitely* going to be read by the rep, their COS, and everybody on the legislative team, which acts as the reps advisory board in many cases. That’s three groups that can and will influence a decision if they read something that forces their hand. 

The trouble is writing a good op-ed that gets in the paper, but even if it ends up in the local news, it’ll probably end up in the priority pile anyways, especially for a house representative. With a Senator, they might not be monitoring your particular paper because they have a much wider constituency, but that’s a moot point. We’ve already won on that front.
$C: How long is an op-ed usually for such a topic? I'm sure it varies, but I guess I'm wondering what the minimum would need to be to make an impact. 
$C: What's a *paper*?
$C: You have to find the humor in a business that sends letters to try convincing payed off politicians to do good
$C: Have you worked/interned in a Congressional office before?

They all get tallied up the same, but calls are unique in that everyone in the office can hear the phone ringing and it can disrupt the work flow if there are multiple calls at once since more senior staff have to then answer it
$C: Just sent my rep this email... as you can tell I have already been through this song and dance with him.

Hello can't wait for you to completely ignore me again when I ask you to support net neutrality as my livelihood completely depends on all bits being treated the same online. I can't wait to see how much money you make from lobby groups to completely throw every single internet user in your district under the bus because a telco paid you not to support net neutrality. Most of all I can't wait for you to fail the governers race because you are completely tone deaf on what your district wants when it comes to net neutrality. OR you can vote to keep net neutrality, and maybe even win the govs seat in the face of statistics, because we both know the presidents party loses big during midterms. any way, can't wait for you total BS excuse on not voting to keep net neutrality and continuing to fail the state as you have been doing.
$C: As someone who works in a Congressional office, please, please, **PLEASE** do not give these people your money. I can promise you that a physical letter is NOT treated differently than an email. They are scanned and entered into the same database. On top of that, due to security screening, hard mail can take up to 3 weeks to arrive in the Congressional office.

This company is trying to profit off you practicing your Constitutional rights. Please don't let them.

EDIT: Downvoted for calling them out. Classic.
$C: > Most importantly, PLEASE MAKE AN INFORMED VOTE DURING YOUR NEXT ELECTION.

In other words, vote for who will fix the most important problems: like corruption and the protection of a free and open internet for all.

**Don’t simply vote for “your team”.**


$C: I'm not paying for your shit. 


No. 
$C: Happy Reddit birthday!!!
$C: This, is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you. Thank you so much for this.
$C: You’re for government (political) control over the Internet? I honestly can’t believe anyone is for that. Doesn’t matter is you’re right or left. So you would be for Trumps administration governing the rules of the Internet right now? We the people can decide with our freedom on the Internet, we don’t need government bureaucracy deciding for us. 
$C: !remindme 12 hours

$C: Yes, go work at reddit. 
$C: https://www.redditinc.com/careers
$C: I too, would like a red name 
ಥ_ಥ 
$C: ##**RED POSTS FASTAH**
$C: Download RES and tag yourself red and you will always see a cool red name
$C: /u/arednametoo
$C: Hmm... I tagged you as "OpFor" it is the best I could do.
$C: Ayy me too tho. 
$C: Make a public commitment to protecting hate speech and hate subs and /u/spez will hire you 
$C: On april fools they should back up the whole site, "accidentally" give a shitload of people admin for a day, and just see what happens.
$C: old.reddit.com exists my friend. 
$C: Fuck the shitty redesign
$C: I love you with all my heart
$C: [deleted]
$C: I hate Net Neutrality.

Made me an admin, and the first thing I'd do would be to ban Net Neutrality (and politics) posts in /r/technology.

It's fine in /r/politics though.
$C: First it would have to get to him, then somebody would have to explain what it was to him, then he’d have to veto it because Obama favoured it.
$C: If I remember my gov classes, if Trump vetoes, then it goes back to Senate/House for a 2/3 majority rule vote to override his veto.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Everyone is saying it won't pass the house, but McConnell was dead set against the senate even voting on this, and yet it still came to a vote, and it still passed despite republicans holding the majority of the senate. Yes, it was a huge struggle, but it shouldn't have happened.

So I think that everyone who says it won't pass the house is leaping to conclusions too early. I mean hell, as recently as a few weeks ago it still looked like it was going to die in the senate too. 

That said, if it reaches the house floor, and if it passes, and if trump vetoes it (a lot of ifs there mind you), then there is no chance the veto will be overruled by this congress. We barely got a simple majority in the senate, there is no way we can convince another 15 republicans to overturn a veto on this if Trump does veto it.
$C: Trump is a honey badger. Not only does he not give a fuck, he doesn't know how to. He lacks the mental capacity. He'll do what ever the last person in the room said after telling him how tremendous and amazing the signing or veto of said legislation will be.

Keep in mind we have a Fox News Room trapped parrot as President.

It's impossible to predict what Trump would do because he's simultaneously creating a trade war with China, while also trying to keep ZTE jobs protected in China. On the one hand they're stealing our jerbs and we need a trade war. On the other hand apparently we shouldn't let them lose jobs over it... somehow.. as if that makes any sense. As someone who sells seafood I'd like there to be a compelling reason as to why my prices keep going up, rather than "I dunno Babyhands McGee must have done something stupid again"
$C: > This has a massive following behind it, and the backlash directed at trump would be monumental.

I'm not sure why you seem to think that Trump would care that 1.) it has a massive following of supporters, and 2.) that he would face a lot of backlash.
$C: 1) it won't pass the house
2) a different set of rules apply to Trump
$C: I don't think he cares
$C: It’s not going to make it to his desk, the House won’t pass it
$C: The odds he would veto it are ~~roughly~~ probably literally 100%.

He will listen to the whispers of his corporate masters, CEO's who humor him and pretend to think he's awesome, while at the same time he'll continue to be secretly and utterly jealous of the least successful of those CEO's for being far wealthier than he will ever be, and he'll sign the damn veto.

It will not be overridden.

And this is ridiculous speculation, because the House will not vote on it, and if they do, it will not pass.
$C: > What are the odds, once this reaches the desk of the President,

Lets start here: 0%. 

This is DOA at the House.
$C: I'm not american but... Why does the president have this power? I feel like giving 1 person the power to cancel something like this seems kind of undemocratic to me. 
$C: Let's be honest; nobody cared about his policies when they voted him in, and just cared that he was an 'alternative' to the establishment.
$C: We're not pessimistic, we're just actually educated on the political realities, unlike yourself.

Paul Ryan will never allow this to the floor because telecoms have donated $722,000 dollars to him. As the House Majority Leader, he is the person that decides that shit, and he doesn't give a shit about backlash because he's retiring.
$C: Most republicans in the Senate voted against it. Trump won't sign it.  Its not a veto. The law allows repeal of regulatory action if Senate house and President agree.  This is a waste of your time. Is going absolutely nowhere. 
$C: >Edit: you guys are pessimistic as hell. Have some hope, you guys!

We have absolutely no reason to be optimistic. Trump is the one who appointed Ajit Pai. 
$C: Not pessimism - sad reality.  This will never pass the House, but even it it did, it would be vetoed by the President.  

The separate court challenges have little likelihood of success, but even those have much better odds that a Republican House using the CRA to reject a rule adopted by an appointee in this clusterfuck of an administration - a person appointed in large part specifically to repeal net neutrality.  And there’s no way Trump ever signs this Bill.  He doesn’t care about the blowback.  The Bill is supported by Democrats, is the right thing to do, and so .... he will just do the opposite.  
$C: honestly, i think if trump sees how big the following is in favor of keeping net neutrality, he'd side with the people so he could get a win and make himself out to look like the good guy, he loves attention plain and simple, people think he would side with ajit pai but if he sees the wind moving in a new direction, chances are, he'll throw pai under the bus just to get a win.
$C: It's the us gov warmachine. .
$C: Trump caring about a backlash? That I would like to see. 
$C: > backlash directed at trump would be monumental.

Except he doesn't give a shit.

But here's the thing... Democrats are backing it, so Trump is going to veto it. He has shown time and time against that he is more about dismantling stuff because Obama or Democrats had a hand in it, instead of actually looking at it in the way of "What's best for the American people?".
$C: It might have a massive following on reddit, but I doubt the average person would know about it or care.
$C: He'll veto it for sure. Remember he put the FCC guy in whose leading the deregulation charge. He wants NN dead.
$C: Optimism isn't realistic. We all know what's going to happen once this goes to Trump.
$C: win or lose its a huge part about the statement
$C: He'd probably pass it just so he could claim credit for saving the internet 
$C: The backlash wouldnt be monumental. This law only went into effect during Obama's presidency.  You guys act like this has been around forever and it's shocking Trump pulled out. I know nothing has changed for me
$C: After all the Trump bashing and censorship in every form of media including social media, I wouldn’t expect him to turn around and support you just because your big government agenda failed at the ballot. 
$C: it wouldn't, because lol fuck u
$C: Trump would not veto this, if you haven't noticed he has done more for the people in 1 yr than every president combined and might I add the most successful also. He will approve this no doubt.
$C: why in the world is every citizen qualified to vote not automatically registered?  here, after you turn 18 you receive your voters card in the mail prior to every election.  it doesn't mean you have to vote, it just means if you do vote the process is extremely fast.  we don't have line ups to vote here like you see down south.
$C: I definitely wouldn’t take a supposed animal rights group seriously if they were letting people take advantage of captive wild animals like that.
$C: I'm on mobile 😕
$C: Somewhere right around 620nm. Beautiful.
$C: No sir. You are damn right. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
$C: As bad as those are the real the problem is the fools who believe the stuff without no reservation and assume their benevolent overlord Trump is perfect in every way. I have my like sbut I also acknowledge their faults...Heck even Reps used to accept that guys like Bush or Reagan had faults too.....not Trump
$C: I don’t deny that Reddit helped Trump but it seems misguided to me to blame Clinton’s loss on Russian disinformation agents. They existed during both of Obama’s elections too: the difference IMO was that Clinton had a lot of skeletons in the closet, which is a big part of why I supported Bernie. We should be blaming the DNC tbh

EDIT: I am not proving your point, I am a US citizen and would be willing to prove it. The fact that you assume any opposition to your claim must necessarily originate from “Russian trolls” only demonstrates that you are biased.
$C: Lol
$C: [deleted]
$C: Lol when people disagree with you in real life do you just stick your fingers in your ears and say “na na i can’t hear you, paid shill!”?
$C: I specifically open announcements just to see how many people there are replying to every admin comment crying about the donut.
$C: Wtf are you talking about lol.

You really think one subreddit mattered that much, to influence an entire general election? You can't be that delusional. 

You're blaming reddit as a company for people's stupidity, then you magnify that stupidity and project it on a national level.

You really think "we wouldn't be going through this if companies like reddit" had better spam protection?

There's a whole world of people out there that don't even know what the fuck reddit is, they're tired of the lack of increase in standard of living, and they're going to attach that lack of development to the reigning political party at the time. These people are pissed off, poor, don't give a fuck about reddit, have no funds toward retirement, are trying to feed their kids, are stuck paying increasing rent, and you think reddit's imperfect "spam protection" influenced their decisions? 

My generation is fucking stupid....
$C: BeepBoopBop! Russian paid bot here. We do not troll from T_D, we live in cucked soyboy heads rent free! M!A!G!A! BeepBoopBop!
$C: So you’re saying that the US population is dumb enough to take the words of people online as gospel and change who they vote for? As a US citizen I’m more concerned that apparently so many people fell for it and trump won. Or maybe..... 🤔
$C: Yeah, I love that the left now doesn't want free speech at all. Familiar with the Bill of Rights by chance?
$C: Don't even put the r/ in front of "the donald" it just brings them more traffic 
$C: yeah,because im sure educated voters are really going to be influenced by a bunch of basement dwelling trolls on a website full of braindead younger age leftists(sarcasm)


$C: The Donald is a threat to your ideology 
$C: A continued demonstration of how important the electorate sees this issue will make politicians coming up for election or re-election value it as well. If a large number of congresspeople and senators make "restore net neutrality" part of their platform then once there isn't a laughably corrupt president it'll be restored.

Also, there is a possibility (however slight) that the last person to speak to Trump before the bill crosses his desk will have fluffed his ego properly and suggested that he sign the bill. Trump has a history of agreeing with whoever he most recently spoke to.
$C: Vetoes aren't final. 
$C: https://www.senate.gov/reference/Legislation/Vetoes/TrumpDJ.htm

Trump has vetoed 0 bills, what makes you think he will start now?
$C: Protest politics doesn’t work. 
$C: It wont even get to a vote in the House, Im betting
$C: It's not useless.  The initial idea was just to force your senators and representatives to  go on the record voting for or against internet freedom.  

Their vote will matter when it's used against them in campaign ads.
$C: It depends. Have those people attempted to use antisemitic sources as justification for their opinions in the past?
$C: Terrible idea
$C: And that is why you lost. True fascism. 
$C: Ryan isn't running in 2018, I very much doubt he cares about electoral chances for his party as much as he does any donors interests that might give him a paycheque down the line.
$C: You mean like the blunami that surfaced in 2016 to stop this shit? Blues will do what they do best. Bitch & moan on the internet and then watch reruns of Friends on Election Day.
$C: Both parties are bad. One is just *worse.*
$C: A lot of people saying that are Russian Bots. If everyone bad, it doesn't matter how bad the person we elected is because everybody bad. Now look what that got us.
$C: On far too many issues, they are.  Republicans represent the rich folks who dispise the peasentry and resent every dollar that hasn't been confiscated from them yet.  The Democrats represent the benevolent aristocrats who are more than happy to drizzle charity on the poor, but get pissed when anyone tried to discuss how they got poor in the first place.

Both parties love perpetual war, mass enprisonment, mass surveillance, bank deregulation, the war on drugs, and the sunsetting of anti-trust laws.

They are not the same, but they are both shit.
$C: Yep, they're both bad
Edit: Why are you booing me? I'm right
$C: Why is the vote so different than?
$C: Friendly reminder: libertarians with principles oppose net neutrality. You're correct on Rand Paul not really being a libertarian (he's explicitly stated this in the past), but this is actually an instance where he's taking the principled libertarian stance on an issue. 
$C: Why would a libertarian support net neutrality?
$C: I mean to be fair, net neutrality is government regulation/rules imposed upon a service provided by a private company, I’m not saying I don’t support net neutrality, but that’s literally the thing that libertarians oppose. 
$C: Rand Paul is by no means a true libertarian and he has often claimed not to be but I don’t know whether a libertarian would necessarily support net neutrality based on libertarian principles. Based on their principles the government doesn’t really have the right to regulate this but they believe in free market and regulation could lead to an actually competitive market because we all know internet providing is a monopoly or duopoly. So I actually don’t really think Rand is being non libertarian by doing this .
$C: I'm not a republican or libertarian. But I'm from Kentucky and know a little about Paul. I don't agree on everything or maybe even most things with him, but I will say this about him. He is very principled. He sticks to his guns and I always know exactly how he will vote. I use VoteSpotter and I haven't ever seen him flop on an issue in the past two years. In this regard he is right there with Bernie from what I can tell, though obviously with an extremely different political stance. His dad was the same way.
$C: HAH!  So what principles do spoiled libertarian daddy's boys have other than "me me me"?
$C: That's because libertarians are just Republicans who want to smoke weed. 
$C: Friendly reminder: Most all Politicians are slimy bastards who would drop you into a pot of boiling water if there was a check with $500,000 dollars involved. Always be weary of these bastards, regardless of what they voted, until lobbying is completely dismantled or regulated in an authoritative and abusive way, expect everyone to be in at least ONE persons pocket. 
$C: Libertarians and "libertarians" alike are against net neutrality.

The "real" libertarians are against is because government regulation.

The fake libertarians are against it because lobbyists or Republican team sports mentality.
$C: Libertarians are racists in disguise. They don't really stand by their stances. They'd rather just cut off their nose to spite their face because they know the cuts will hurt brown people harder.
$C: Isn't it just great when voting for a smaller party is the same as throwing your vote out or making a protest vote to Barney
$C: Hence why Trump won - most regular people who happen to be conservatives don't have any use for corporaye welfare, so when a populist comes along and promises to protect the little guy, it resonates.
$C: And the Democrats aren't?  Keep in mind there were plenty of Corporations on both sides of this one.  When it comes to bank deregulation, Democrats and Republicans suddenly feel all non-partisan.

Credit where credit is due for being on the right side of this one, but that doesn't earn them a clean slate.
$C: *3

One was independent. 
$C: nearly total correlation is sufficient to assume causation.
$C: I wouldn't say it's a sample at all, this is the direct population of interest (U.S. Senators).  To that end I'd say this case is worth a fair bit more than correlation, regarding the vote. Though they are supposed to be representative of the American population.
$C: > It’s telling that there are no Against voters with “Democrat” after their name...

FTFY

[Like Lego bricks, not Legoes or Legos or Lego's](https://i.giphy.com/media/3o7TKH2MQAHwqCMVgs/giphy.mp4)
$C: I'm not sure, but I believe the proper grammar would have been ```Againsts'```.

When plural, you append ```s```.

When singular possessive, you append ```'s```.

When plural possessive, you append ```s'```.

It's plural as we're talking about multiple potential against side people, and it's possessive as we're talking about people belonging to a group.
$C:  I went with the possessive.

The against, has a possessive democratic property?
$C: I’m not sure as a Canadian, but my belief is:

Democrats represent the will of their constituents, and republicans represent the will of their donors and corporate owners.
$C: Congressional Democrats have supported net neutrality for years, since before it became as hot an issue as it is.
$C: HAHAHAHAHAHA /R/POLITICS BACK YOU GO HAHAHAHAHAHA
$C: 
>But unlike most of you, I appreciate the other side of an argument

A good way to convey your point is always to call people stupid.

>censorship by downvote technique on this site is pretty effective. 

You mean filtering content? Censorship is a wildly incorrect word to use as you're being downvoted because your argument makes no sense.
$C: no it doesnt
$C: Technically competition *does* run down prices. 

I remember hearing that Comcast dropped prices in cities where Google Fiber was setting up for obvious reasons. 

The issue is, most ISPs aren’t competing against each other. They’re oligopolies. Internet is price fixed. If they got rid of Net Neutrality; it isn’t going to change their relationships. They’ll just have full control into milking the net for all it’s worth like broadcast companies did to television and radio. 
$C: I’m usually against legislating morality but in this case, corporations, lobbyists, and politicians CLEARLY aren’t going to do the right thing unless forced to. 
$C: Republicans want government small enough to fit in between women and their doctors, and every couple's relationship. 
$C: I would argue the reason those cable companies have a monopoly in the first place is government intervention
$C: >  for a variety of reasons

Let's not sugarcoat it, it's money. Whatever bullshit they're spouting is just cover for the corruption.
$C: And yet there was no shortage of shills on Reddit telling us how evil net neutrality was when the FCC was debating it. 
$C: You have proof now that republicans are corrupt and you still want to vote for them?
$C: Thats ironic.
$C: On the flip side, this is how we feel about Democrats who vote to take our guns away.
$C: Or Senators are voting by party lines as they almost always do. 
$C: It is though. It doesn't matter what else they do or don't support, if they are against net neutrality, they need to go. It doesn't matter if they are voting with their party. No to Net Neutrality? You need to go. People need to stop trying to measure them up by their general votes. If they say no to something crucial for you, but yes to 6 things that are "fine" but not crucial? They need to go. Chances are you can find a rational individual who would get you the crucial yes and those other 6 as well. 


I know cherry picking is usually bad, but when it comes to stuff like this, it is brilliant. Plus, Americans have a hard-on for anything freedom, so shitting on that in any capacity in politics should be career suicide... But alas, sheep exist for the purpose of their herders. 
$C: Fuck Roy Blunt 
$C: 2022, he was reelected in 2016 so he's up in 2022. 
$C: Can Roy Blunt leave already? How is he still in office? Missouri needs a shake up in all the upper offices
$C: Omfg... Abbott is a fucking joke.
$C: People with large brains and education tend to use more "flowery" language. It's a proven fact. ;) 
$C: Oh god I’d love to ducking see that
$C: Same really, I used to think both parties were the same and that most of the time was just name calling because they have different stances and opinions. But now I realised one of them is total garbage.
$C: I am American and it's blood-boiling how many people vote Republican.  There are many reasons, but one is because of the religious fist clenched around the voter base.  

A friend of mine doesn't vote for anyone pro-choice *no matter what*.  A candidate could be an obvious corporate hound convicted of rape, and he'd still vote for him/her if the opposition was pro-choice.  There's absolutely no talking him down from this viewpoint either.  His vision of God is infallible.  How do you debate with that?
$C: Yup! People don't vote based on policy or party voting preferences. They vote based on what offended them today or what the news said or what _feels_ right. 
$C: I seriously do not get how Americans keep doing this
$C: You realise that you're only being shown a subset of voting records designed to paint one party as bad, right?

The general problem with the US government is partisanship - stuff gets opposed simply because the other party suggested it. You can check out a [full list of votes](https://votesmart.org/bills/NA/2018/) and see the same thing happening in both directions. The user above is just cherry picking his examples to play politics.

Let's be clear: These representatives are not acting in the public interest, but at the same time we can't continue to pretend that only one party is doing this.

Edit: Those downvoting this are a big part of the problem. Is it too much to ask that people pull their heads out of their arses and recognise these major problems rather than circlejerking over propaganda?
$C: It's more like how the Democrats don't have any common sense.
$C: Abortion.  Single issue candidates are a problem.
$C: It's been reposted (and updated) for over a year. And should be often.
$C: Credit to /u/ohaioohio 
$C: It's a meme worth spreading.
$C: Pretty much. 
$C: Erm, that's how it looks to me now.
$C: I wish I could plaster this across every billboard in America! 
$C: It’s a mathematical inevitability of the first past the post voting system, there will always be two parties while this is the case, and voting third party will always not matter. 
$C: By the right definition all humans are bad. It’s when we forget that there are degrees to which badness occurs, that tyranny takes hold. Don’t shoot yourself in the foot defending yourself from a cockroach, when there’s a tiger behind you. 
$C: You mean a list of facts? Oh yes I forgot you don't believe in those. 
$C: Why is that an issue?
$C: Texan for Beto!
$C: Time Warner, AT&T, and Verizon all sent money Cruz's way. Thats why he voted against NN. He's a shill, through and through. Motherfucker.

Beto is my boi.
$C: I can never tell if the Republicans complaining about snowflakes and Democrat propaganda are just stupid or are knowingly using propaganda themselves. It's just... Hard to tell sometimes because they're just so *fucking* stupid. 
$C: I vote every chance. Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Austin, all majority blue. Fort Worth red. Rural mostly red but not entirely. We're gerrymandered as fuck and bigger than Germany. Almost half is blue.
$C: On it
$C: Oh well in that case I think maybe *I’ll* be the rep for Texas. Starting tomorrow. Thanks for the idea guys, couldn’t have done it without you! 
$C: I cried into my hands. Isn’t that enough?
$C: There isn’t enough time to apologize for all the heathens — only time for the heathen leaders.
$C: As a Louisiana native, I will be personally writing Sen. Kennedy to thank him for breaking with his party and voting for the bill. Cassidy, on the other hand, can eat a dick.
$C: Collins votes against the Republican Party line more often than any other Republican Senator, and Murkowksi also fairly regularly defects on votes. They were both strongly against repealing the ACA last year, for instance.
$C: As a maine native, im pretty sure susan collins rarely votes with her party
$C: > voted against party lines, I'm honestly pretty surprised and impressed they did so.

they are voting because they are highly contested districts. they know they would lose the midterm.

dont be so cosy with them. they voted in betsy devos.
$C: It's because you have a very narrow idea of politics and like to stereotype people by their associations not their voting record or literal personal statements in support of net neutrality.
$C: The only reason you'd think net neutrality is an issue is if you have no idea what it does and just hate da gubbermints or are bought out by corporations.
$C: the data doesn't lie lmao

one party votes for something 80% of the countrt wants.

$C: so easy to tell when someone is a the_donald bot without even checking
$C: They're bought and paid for by people who aren't as bad as the other group

Still bad, but not as immediately bad
$C: I didn't say all Republicans are lowlife pieces of shit, I simply called him a Republican lowlife piece of shit.

So for the record, Jeff Flake:
Republican √
Lowlife √
Piece of shit √
$C: It's fucking majority, stop being ignorant.
$C: He introduced a Net Neutrality bill back in March, although it was criticized for being too weak. His vote isn't **that** surprising.

Anyway, good on him.
$C: The only thing that matters is votes. If, come 2018, you vote Republican, then nothing changes. Then there's absolutely no punishment for this, and they know that.

But you're probably screwed, because you probably disagree with Democrats on 99% of policy. So in your position, it's a tough call.
$C: Hey, ultrafeedlord34, just a quick heads-up:  
**seperate** is actually spelled **separate**. You can remember it by **-par- in the middle**.

Bullshit. Prove it. Show me a vote where R's were for "The rights of people"
$C: Republicans subsidize the oil industry and other shit industries like there's not tomorrow. Get the fuck out of here. 

Republicans just care about corporations and profits instead of your bitch ass. Democrats will at least try and help the people, which is the third word on the DOI. Shallow. Just shallow thought abilities over there. 
$C: What the frick does this even mean? How does your statement apply to his comment? It doesn't make sense.

But yeah, I'd rather pay higher taxes for nice things and programs instead of letting myself be raped for profit by unregulated corporate monopolies. Just a personal preference.
$C: Our parties swapped platforms in the past, so maybe the colors aligned with yours back then but switched when the platforms did.
$C: No idea.  I wonder what the colors were back in the days of the Whigs, or the America First party?
$C: I can only think of two "red" states that fall under all three of these..
$C: [deleted]
$C: Lots of those low tax red states actually take in more money from the feds than they pay back in taxes. Enjoy your welfare
$C: They can be, they also have to subsidize all those red states. 
$C: This guy needs to experience Illinois pension liabilities first hand! I think it's about 11k per person and 24k per person if you live in Chicago. That is the number each of us would need to payout today to close the gap.
$C: I don’t know why this is downvoted. 1.) it’s a matter of opinion and 2.)blue states have their own set of problems. I know reddit is primarily blue and even more so single issue blue and rather apathetic about other issues (see net neutrality as a perfect example). The downvotes just make me feel like people are in denial about their own parties problems or simply aren’t aware that both parties have flaws and good things. 
$C: I guess I missed a couple, but it's still not many and still proves my point.
$C: Well as far as I know, net neutrality is about ISP's being able to micromanage and monetize their customers AND the web based services their customers want to access. Ie turning the internet into a "packaged" based program similar to Cable TV, making the user pay more for the "sports package" or the "streaming package" all while charging services like Netflix and Spotify fees to use "high speed priority" so they can provide a better experience service to customers. With net neutrality, ISP's aren't able to discriminate whether you like using Google or Bing, Netflix or Hulu, Spotify or Apple Music and therefore aren't able to further monetize a system that they have already monopolized. 

But I could be wrong. 
$C: The thing is NN is in no way enabling the current ISP monopolies, and it has the opposite effect on competition online (it makes it illegal for e.g. Google to bribe ISPs to ban competition). The argument against it makes no sense whatsoever. It's obviously aimed at people who don't understand the issue in the slightest. It has all the trigger words to get the idiots riled up (anti-competition, gubberment, overreach, regulation etc.)
$C: That's literally the opposite of net neutrality. Removing net neutrality allows ISP's to regulate the content of the internet to keep us "safe" / remove all competition on the internet. What the government is trying to do is allow no entity to regulate what is allowed on the internet, as long as it's legal, no matter how much they may want to. 
$C: Oh that's right
$C: That fucker would have voted just as any other republican would have.  
$C: Why hasn’t he just resigned yet? When he first got the diagnosis I thought for sure the most logical and patriotic thing to do would be to step down and give the seat to someone present and healthy.

Kind of an egotistical douche move to keep the seat until you slowly die.
$C: > very serious health issues

He has brain cancer. He will likely be dead soon.
$C: It was an honest question, no need to blow a fuse.
$C: I'm sorry, I completely forgot about the brain cancer thing
$C: Who the fuck up voted this garbage? 
$C: FUCK OFF BOT THIS AINT THE TIME
$C: Sorry. Ahem, dang it Mr. Rebublican man!
$C: I don't know much about Missouri's situation the moment but if it's even half as bad as Kansas I wish you guys luck.
$C: No problem.  I saw Cnet screwed up but I don't want to create an account there.  But I noticed AR had 3 senators and AK had one in the list. Thanks for fixing it.
$C: **Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire**

The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in New York City on March 25, 1911 was the deadliest industrial disaster in the history of the city, and one of the deadliest in US history. The fire caused the deaths of 146 garment workers – 123 women and 23 men – who died from the fire, smoke inhalation, or falling or jumping to their deaths. Most of the victims were recent Italian and Jewish immigrant women aged 14 to 23; of the victims whose ages are known, the oldest victim was 43-year-old Providenza Panno, and the youngest were 14-year-olds Kate Leone and "Sara" Rosaria Maltese.

The factory was located on the eighth, ninth and tenth floors of the Asch Building, at 23–29 Washington Place in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan.

**Ludlow Massacre**

The Ludlow Massacre was an attack by the Colorado National Guard and Colorado Fuel and Iron Company guards on a tent colony of 1,200 coal miners and their families at Ludlow, Colorado, on April 20, 1914. About two dozen people, including miners' wives and children, were killed. The chief owner of the mine, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., was widely criticized for having orchestrated the massacre.

The massacre, the seminal event in the Colorado Coal Wars, resulted in the deaths of 53.

$C: Likely because they had been actively misled by corporate interests.
$C: "The internet is a series of tubes..."
$C: They definitely were misled. A lot of my Repub friends after explaining it, all agreed it is a terrible idea and that NN was the correct action. And this is from staunch Repubs who still worship the ground Trump walks on. And while they will never vote against him candidate wise they wholeheartedly agree NN should stay. Only sad part is Im in a Dem solid state and our Reps already agree on NN.
$C: No, a university performed it, they didn't just interview university students.
$C: The program for public consultation is part of the university of Maryland. The poll was of nationwide voters, not just voters at the school. Your point that it was not of senators is a good one though. 
$C: They don’t call it Obamacare for the Internet for nothing 
$C: Obama was black? Did he stop being black?

Also, not sure that makes much sense considering many states that voted for trump had voted for Obama...
$C: eeeee
$C: It's weird to see people over there circle\-jerking about things that aren't just objectively false, but are like, the exact opposite of everything I believe to be true. \(And by weird, i mean frustrating as hell.\)

Last time I went over there, they were complaining about money in politics. Which is good \-\- I'm glad we agree that campaign finance reform is important \-\- but they seemed to be under the unshakable impression that it's the Republicans that are in favor of clean campaign finance laws, despite all the voting records clearly showing it's the opposite.

EDIT: \(Examples of the democrats being far better when it comes to getting money out of politics: [1](https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/32154#.Wvz62KQvzmg), [2](http://votesmart.org/bill/votes/41152), [3](http://votesmart.org/bill/votes/21011), [4](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2002/roll034.xml), and [5](http://votesmart.org/bill/votes/49906).\)

$C: they don’t even talk about stormy daniel 
$C: Net neutrality is government interference, the government interferes with ISPs to stop them from doing crooked shit. That's why the right is against it. 
$C: But why would *anyone* want to watch/read shitty biased news at all? Like yeah CNN kind of sucks a lot, but the solution isn't something that sucks in the opposite direction.

There's still a lot of news that doesn't suck - news that isn't trying to fill 24 hours of airtime or post listicles to get clicks. That's the solution.
$C: Covering them accurately is "bashing" them? How about they stop doing shitty things?
$C: I agree that most media is pandering to a degree.  But that doesn’t mean that all media is equally inaccurate or biased.  

But I understand the criticism which is why I think everyone should listen to media that disagree with at least once a day.  I usually listen to the federalist and skim through Fox new.  It’s sometimes makes my blood boil, but it has helped me personally to understand the other side more.  

Which goes to another issue I have.  I desperately like debating and I get tired of arguing with liberals, but every conservative sub is quite quick with the bahmamer.  Pol is one source but it’s hard to get past the blantent conspiracy theosrist, Nazis and Trolling. 
$C: Sigh...
$C: fake news doil
$C: name checks out
$C: But the news media stand nothing to gain by pushing net neutrality and everything to lose, some of them are owned by the telecoms.
$C: The Republican Party is platform for ignorant, uneducated, racist scum. You clowns deserve nothing but ridicule. 
$C: Need to gravitate to Wikipedia
$C: > If they explained it the way Reddit does 95% of the time, yeah I can see why people would be against it.

Go ahead, how would you explain this issues "objectively"?
$C: I remember when someone approached me asking if I would support clean coal. I was younger and didn’t know what that was, so it sounded nice. “Oh, clean coal, well that sounds better than normal coal, seems good for the environment” And I checked yes. The results were used to say that most of our uni student body supported it.
$C: No you're absolutely right. Policies and news should be presented in a fair unbiased manner. It just seems impossible for the average person to easily obtain unbiased news and information
$C: Yeah, but how else are corporate stooges supposed to remove legislation that has sweeping public approval but costs their campaign donors massive new revenue streams?

Don't tell people what it actually *is*, of course. Just rile up their tribal senses and point them at the nearest opinion poll. 
$C: Absolutely agree! For years I was independent (and still would call myself that, even though definitely leaning democrat after all the current bullshit) and the reason I'm independent is because I like to look at each issue separately and decide for myself. We all have brains. We need to use them. 
$C: Turns out that both democrats and republicans support internet freedom as a principle. 

It's just a difference of approach: do you enforce it with heavy regulation making sure that no one favors any particular network traffic to empower smaller players to innovate more (i.e. "Net Neutrality"), or do you let people and companies be free to operate how they see fit to empower the larger players to innovate more ("Open Internet").
$C: Anecdotal, but lots of people where I'm from vote a colour no matter what for their entire lives. Because it's all they've ever done and it's all their family has ever done. They picked a team 100+ years ago and that's that for all of eternity on every issue. I'll never understand it. 
$C: Just like “pro life” , “Net neutrality” is a political term invented by its supporters.
$C: They favored it in the survey, they didn't vote for nothing.

As far as I understood, only 3 republicans, as well as all of the democrats, voted for keeping Net Neutrality. All other republicans voted against.
$C: When it was actually explained to them of course they voted to keep it. I'm just saying that's what they hear when they only get information from biased sources
$C: You might be mistaken. 75% of republican voting people who are not in the government support it. Literally every no vote was by a republican politician.
$C: This is a survey, not a vote. If 75% of Republicans had voted for candidates that wanted to protect Net Neutrality this wouldn't be an issue.
$C: The real problem of your bipartial system is that Americans seem to treat politics like a bloody football game, hoping their flag gets the goal and acting like fans of the other one are all but animals. Both sides fail to see the human, nobody seems to treat others like "people with a different view on things", everyone is either an "anti-progress racist redneck" or an "SJW hipster libtard". As a foreigner, this is what's wrong with America, you don't see such a scary degree of tribalism over at my country which doesn't try to put the entire nation under 2 flags.
$C: It was enacted in 2015, so we had six years of no NN under Obama as well.
$C: My own legitimate answer -- I think it is a band-aid on a bullet wound.

The underlying problem is that local monopoly of the telecommunications infrastructure and long-term sweetheart deals with the big cable/telecom companies prohibit new ISP's from entering existing markets.  I live in Atlanta where [Google is finding it nearly impossible to roll out their new fiber service](https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2017/09/19/google-fiber-slows-metro-atlanta-rollout.html) even with the cooperation of the local governments.  If Google with all its billions and co-operation from City Hall can't effectively enter the market, then no one can.  

Insufficient competition means that there is generally only one broadband provider for a geographic area and gives that provider monopoly power to do anti-consumer things (like censor the internet) that would be corporate suicide if they had to compete in an open marketplace.  Until these thousands of anti-competitive arrangements are addressed, Net Neutrality simply papers over one aspect of the problem of insufficient competition and makes the current situation tolerable enough for most consumers to quiet down and let the big ISP's continue their monopolies forever.  It does nothing to address any of the other negative effects of telecom monopoly, like predatory pricing, anti-competitive vertical integration, or restricted rollout of services.

Far better in my eyes to pull the bandage off, let net neutrality die, watch Comcast and their ilk start abusing customers, and get people upset enough to effect real change.
$C: I edited my original post since multiple people asked, let me know what you think 
$C: I edited my post since multiple people were asking, feel free to check it out and maybe give me your take. 
$C: People can come to different conclusions upon understanding a situation, including those which may be unpopular. Barriers to competition at the local level I think create the moral hazard which can allow telecoms to get away with non-net neutral strategies. Open up competition, and the provider who offers the best product will likely force the others to comply. Data caps is one instance in recent years where consumer demand helped influence positive change. I think there are multiple approaches to reach net neutrality, but leaving it in federal political limbo while there are many issues at the local level is very concerning. Look at what happened to Google Fiber in Nashville for example.
$C: Possibly I didn't, it does seem like there are many layers to it's implications.
I edited my original post with a bit more of what I think it implies, feel free to correct me. 
$C: The main problem is the USA is the fact that the government helped create and helps protect regional monopolies for ISPs. If our government didn't kill competition we wouldn't even think of Title II as a benefit. But instead of focusing on the actual source of the problem Reddit wants to get up in arms about this tiny "victory." I feel like it is incredibly damaging to think that this is a win. This is a distraction from the root problem and it is working perfectly. Everyone gets to pat themselves on the back and high-five over the Title II vote while the government continues to make sure we have no options and pay more for less bandwidth.
$C: Nice strawman but it’s possible to be against NN and pro local loop unbundling 
$C: If you want a free market you are, by definition, against anti-competitive legislation that led to oligopolies.
$C: Opinions are allowed, but no one has to validate them or agree with them. You know, actual free speech
$C: This is the kind of thing that puts people off when it comes to hot button topics like this. 

It's not even like this is a difficult topic to discuss, you could easily have provided some insite instead of telling him to shut up.

$C: Literally responded to the bait and thinks it’s bad.

Ez b8
$C: Oh opposed to all the "dumb Republicans who watch brainwashing fox news and only hate it because Obama did it" comments?

Let's be honest here. This is one dude doing the exact same thing as everyone else except he's on the wrong side of the circlejerk.

[this paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8195/893e84945028efb2f1062ac5aea509b8dfab.pdf)

Abstract:

>The Federal Communications Commission’s proposed net neutrality rules would, among other things, prohibit broadband access providers from prioritizing traffic, charging differential prices based on the priority status, imposing congestion-related charges, and adopting business models that offer exclusive content or that establish exclusive relationships with particular content providers. The proposed regulations are motivated in part by the concern that the broadband access providers will adopt economically inefficient business models and network management practices due to a lack of sufficient competition in the provision of broadband access services. This paper addresses the competitive concerns motivating net neutrality rules and addresses the potential impact of the proposed rules on consumer welfare. We show that **there is significant and growing competition among broadband access providers and that few significant competitive problems have been observed to date**. We also evaluate claims by net neutrality proponents that regulation is justified by the existence of externalities between the demand for Internet access and content services. We show that **such interrelationships are more complex than claimed by net neutrality proponents and do not provide a compelling rationale for regulation.** We conclude that **antitrust enforcement and/or more limited regulatory mechanisms provide a better framework for addressing competitive concerns raised by proponents of net neutrality.**

[and also this paper](http://papers.nber.org/tmp/2378-w22040.pdf)

Abstract: 

>We correct and extend the results of Gans (2015) regarding the effects of net neutrality regulation on equilibrium outcomes in settings where a content provider sells its services to consumers for a fee. We examine both pricing and investment effects. **We extend the earlier paper’s result that weak forms of net neutrality are ineffective and also show that even a strong form of net neutrality may be ineffective.** In addition, we demonstrate that, **when strong net neutrality does affect the equilibrium outcome, it may harm efficiency by distorting both ISP and content provider investment and service-quality choices.**

Note: The consensus here is not that net neutrality is bad, just that it's an overly broad solution to the problem, and that a better solution is changing other regulations and antitrust regulators

>Kahn rejected the term "Net Neutrality", calling it "a slogan". He cautioned against dogmatic views of network architecture, saying the need for experimentation at the edges shouldn't come at the expense of improvements elsewhere in the network.



>"If the goal is to encourage people to build new capabilities, then the party that takes the lead is probably only going to have it on their net to start with and it's not going to be on anyone else's net. You want to incentivize people to innovate, and they're going to innovate on their own nets or a few other nets,"

>The average connection speed in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2012 was 7.4 Mbps,
the eighth fastest among all nations, and **the fastest when compared to other countries with
either a similar population or land mass**.

And then they say well no one's investing in building out networks but then

>Responding to the increasing consumer demand for services accessed through broadband, the
private sector has been driving important advances in infrastructure and technology. U.S.
telecommunications firms have made significant investments in infrastructure; for example, just two of the largest U.S. **telecommunications companies account for greater combined
stateside investment than the top five oil/gas companies, and nearly four times more than the
big three auto companies combined**.
 In fact, since President Obama took office in early 2009,
nearly $250 billion in private capital has been invested in U.S. wired and wireless broadband
networks. In just the last two years, more high-speed fiber cables have been laid in the United
States than in any similar period since 2000.

Not to mention the recent innovations coming with 5G broadband. 

>"Columbia University Law School professor Tim Wu observed the Internet is not neutral in terms of its impact on applications having different requirements. It is more beneficial for data applications than for applications that require low latency and low jitter, such as voice and real-time video. He explains that looking at the full spectrum of applications, including both those that are sensitive to network latency and those that are not, the IP suite isn't actually neutral. He has proposed regulations on Internet access networks that define net neutrality as equal treatment among similar applications, rather than neutral transmissions regardless of applications. He proposes allowing broadband operators to make reasonable trade-offs between the requirements of different applications, while regulators carefully scrutinize network operator behavior where local networks interconnect."

-Tim Wu, the guy who [literally invented net neutrality as a concept](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=388863)
Some good alternatives:

Local loop unbundling (basically "allowing multiple telecommunications operators to use connections from the telephone exchange to the customer's premises") + stronger antitrust laws

tldr:
net neutrality is a broad brush solution to a problem that could be better solved by local loop unbounding and better anti-trust regulation

(Another separate comment I had made)

Data that comes from content providers such as Netflix *needs* to be prioritized because of the nature of it and the order of the packages matter. Given how much network bandwidth Netflix uses, this creates *extraordinary* strain on managing networks, which drives up the costs. Right now, that cost is spread onto all the users of the network, even those who don't use Netflix. 

They're wouldn't be charging Netflix more to access those customers. They're charging Netflix more because Netflix needs prioritized data. Netflix currently gets a free ride. They get to charge their customers less, and the costs they cause on the network get distributed to everyone, so it's not reflected in the true cost of providing that service.

What's happening right now is a deadweight loss. The *total* cost of providing Netflix isn't accurately reflected because of the network externalities. 

Here's a paper: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1585254

>According to the models, the only unambiguous beneficiaries of net neutrality regulation are content providers: Consumers are unambiguously worse off under net neutrality, while the effect on platform operators is ambiguous

>. If a more realistic profit ratio is imposed, the authors’ proof that net neutrality is surplus-enhancing no longer holds. I employ numeric simulations to decompose the factors underlying this reversal. The results indicate that net neutrality may function as a vehicle for transferring surplus from consumers and platform operators to content providers, rather than creating surplus. The losses sustained by consumers and platform operators under net neutrality outweigh any gains enjoyed by content providers as the profit ratio is adjusted to less empirically implausible levels, ***which leads to deadweight loss under net neutrality***.

Here's another source: http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/dennis.carlton/research/pdfs/NetNeutralityConsumerWelfare.pdf

______

one step at a time
$C: The midterm elections are critical, especially in the House. Net Neutrality is a fairly popular issue, so if the Republicans in the house vote it down, this likely hurts them in the midterms. That's where the victory is for the Democrats here. 
$C: Except the game isn't over yet. This is more like first and 10 at the two minute warning.
$C: It's more like celebrating the idea that we can win. In the football analogy, I guess it's like celebrating the first down when playing against a team that was previously seen as perfect players.
$C: It's not - this bill is 100% going to be killed by the Repubs when it reaches the House.
$C: ...this whole thing is nonsense.  To overcome a presidential veto you need 2/3 majority in house and senate.  does 52-47 sound like 2/3 majority?

This is all outrage manufacturing by democrats on a bill they know won't pass.

edit: you can downvote me all you want, but when you have no logical rebuttal it doesn't change reality, it just means you got emotional.
$C: And McCain hasn’t voted very much recently, so you can basically mark him as a absent most of the time.
$C: These are all predictions. All of this are just predictions. The fact is after Title II was made law in 2015 for the 2 years it was active it led to a 5.6&#37; decrease in broadband network investment, the first ever outside a recession. So I'll take my bet on the repealing actually being the best choice by far.
$C: Because they make "contributions" to the politicians who make the legislation that allows (or repeal the legislation that prevents) monopolies.
$C: Partly because those carriers built the actual hardware running the internet in this country. They've paid to cable and pipe major sections of the nation, and splitting apart the company, while plausible, is scary what kind of attrition it may cause.
$C: I've never met somebody on Reddit who lived where a single ISP held a monopoly.

I have *personally* lived somewhere that had a monopoly, and that was in a village in Alaska, inaccessible by road, population of 400 people.
$C: Why don't his supporters care about stuff like this?  

The two sentences are mutually exclusive.   The leakers can exist or are fake, there is no room for compromise, existence is a binary.
$C: It still blows my mind.
$C: Wahhh. Whatboutism!!! You can’t answer the question. 
$C: When did Trump flop like a fish?
$C: Tried that earlier. I got “I want it gone because it pisses off libruls! I don’t even know what it does.”
$C: It won't stop, though. It *never* stops.
$C: Eh. Dems are seizing onto the issue because it falls within their party line, and it's something that voters care about. It's an easy way to distract from more pressing issues, like their complete and utter disrespect for the First Amendment. It's ironic\-\-the people "freeing" the internet today are the people who are going to sanitize it tomorrow.

$C: > the president doesn't need to sign it.

He needs to not veto it. But he will veto it. 
$C: He'll veto. And if he doesn't veto, he'll pocket veto. the only way to override the president is with a super majority, which NN doesn't have.
$C: He can veto it within 10 days,   and then it has to go back through the process again only now it has to get a 2/3rds majority in both Chambers to pass. 
$C: its reaaaally funny how you think this will pass in the house
$C: > That Republican you are blindly voting against might be one of the ones who voted for this bill.

Three Republicans, Susan Collins (R-Maine), John Kennedy (R-LA) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) 

There ya go. Zero Dems voted against NN, though. It's not about bllindly voting one way or another: it's about voting for the party that ISN'T wholly owned by corporations. (The Dems are partially owned, of course)
$C: [deleted]
$C: They will if it affects their seat in the next election.
$C: Well I suppose that would be since the invention of formalized democracy in Athens.
$C: The house needs voter support which is also why reps are much easier to lobby them vs senators. 

No amount of funds will get you a seat of your district hates you.  Plus California and NY dominate the house,  both strongly support NN for their economies. 

Texas sits somewhere in the middle,  but expect Texas plus South to just go FU to dems if positioned that way. 
$C: That applies to Republican government.
$C: quick thing, homie: you're about to get downvoted to oblivion, and it's not gonna be because of echo chambers, or liberal circle-jerking, or whatever else you might be tempted to ascribe it to. this isn't because people can't handle your brand of nasty truth.

$C: How does Ryan go about preventing a bill from being voted on?
$C: America's speaker of the house (the guy who controls votes, right?) Has a party bias? Jesus fucking christ.
$C: I’m a registered independent, and this is what I detest about our partisan political system - it’s less about doing what’s right, putting country over party and more about “landing a punch” on your political “enemies.” We need more independents in Congress.

$C: It seems as if you are the one doing the shit spouting here...
$C: He was forced to, by McConnell, then Trump promoted him. but keep sucking that orange cock.
$C: Why would you say "spouting shit from your mouth" ?

I'm your fellow countryman. I love my country. Donald Trump is not smart, but lots of presidents haven't been the smartest guy on their cabinet; democracy should not be replaced by a panel of experts. 

The president has publicly said he doesn't understand it. He is also an opportunist, that's a very objective perspective on him. He preys on fear and angst, which is not what makes him an idiot, he's just also an idiot, those two things together make him easy to manipulate, and in this case we the people can manipulate him to do something good.

No reason to be rude. If I had been alive when Carter bitched out to the Iranians over hostages and you had called him an idiot on a street corner in lieu of an Internet forum, I wouldn't have cursed at you even if I supported Carter. It does nothing to move the conversation forward. This is why the U.S. senate and congress have strict protocol, so that a debate won't devolve into a squabble.
$C: Just checked, Congress can veto with 2/3 votes and make it a law
$C: Not necessarily. Congress can override the veto with a 2/3 vote. 
$C: working out great, country has been on the rise.
$C: I see NN as a solution in dire need of a problem. 
$C: I fundamentally disagree with Title II. From the 2 years Net Neutrality was law investment in broadband network went down by 5.6&#37; something never seen before outside a recession. The Internet doesn't need the government to step in and put more regulations on it. It only makes existing ISP monopolies harder to topple and new businesses harder to be created. We were doing just fine before 2015 and we'll continue to be so even after NN is fully repealed. 

This article pretty much sums up my views on NN. [Link](https://techpolicycorner.org/net-neutrality-v-title-ii-explained-3ad8d576a50a)

$C: Not to mention any payments they made were likely peanuts compared to what they stand to make/lose on this. The payments are the least of their concerns.
$C: You know 45 is going to veto it. He won’t even understand the literature of what he’s vetoing but he’ll do it nonetheless because it will milk an endless amount of ‘liberal’ tears for his cult.
$C: At least in this scenario their donations were towards a set of laws that protect the consumer. 

Americans need to sort out congress and remove the influence campaign donators and lobbyists have on their politics. Land of the free? More like land of the paid...

$C: You cannot have one without the other...
$C: Fake net neutrality only applies to ISPs, not massive communications platforms like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google. Those platforms now have almost total control over online information and are now blocking access to content, censoring or shutting out users and manipulating what data consumers can and can’t see online. This is increasingly becoming standard practice for Silicon Valley.

Proponents of Obama’s net neutrality often cite a dozen “examples” of ISPs blocking or throttling since 2005, but each case is extremely weak, was immediately fixed, or was a network management issue. However, in the 2.5 years the fake net neutrality rules were in place, social media giants like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have repeatedly been caught censoring content (primarily from conservatives), blocking, banning or demonetizing users, and abusing user data with little transparency. They even work with foreign governments to silence voices online that don’t fit political agendas.
$C: Wasn't really expecting a Shawshank reference, but I am 100℅ on with it.
$C: I am not from the US but I have to deal with tons of customer emails. We usually do not start with the respons from scratch but use pre made text blocks and alter those when necesary.

However every mail gets taged with apropiate labels.(cancelation, win10, upload_bug) and if necesary we decide on new labels in short meetings twice a day. 

Excerpts with feature requests get forwarded to a messahe board for the ceo and developers.

What I am trying to say is tjat while it may look like we do not value the mails at all they are very important and we base many decissions on them.

I guess it all depends on the person/company receiving the mails. 
$C: I hardly ever write or call (which I should), but I do vote.  As a democrat living in Oklahoma, I know that my vote likely won’t make a difference, but at least I did my part.  I’ve also been going to protests to voice my disapproval, which would have been unthinkable for me a few years back.
$C: Take a break sometimes because all the hot news is depressing.. but yes. You are right. 
$C: I bet that cup of coffee is probably tax deductible, though.

$C: Yeah right.
$C: I stopped at 'then than'. /s
$C: Yeah not religious here, just using the phrase. And my congressmen are republican so it might appeal to their Christian sensibility. 
$C: > Disregarding a well written letter because of a common phrase isn't edgy, it's stupid

“I know that it’s unlikely you’ll read this message but if people like me remain silent, you’ll only hear the loudest and stupidest of your constituents”

$C: Sounds like Canadians who voted for Justin Trudeau just cause he said he was going to legalize weed. (Still hasn't)
$C: [deleted]
$C: It’s probably because of them being paid off. Corporate greed is a monster. I’m all for most Republican policies: protecting the rights of the individual to practice their religion, bear arms, be free from unreasonable taxation, and protecting the American way of life from those who might seek to destroy it. But every now and again, the Republicans in Congress make some pretty messed up choices that even their voter base disagrees with. I wish elected officials just represented their voter base, instead of making deals behind the scenes and trying to dictate what the American people should and shouldn’t support.
$C: But hold on, if they're getting paid off, why is it *just* republicans? There's no reason why paying off democrats wouldn't be just as prevalent.
$C: Let you keep your hard earned money and guns
$C: Nothing because conservatism is dead in American politics.
$C: Messaging and scare tactics.

$C: Personal Liberties, immigration, security, and half of healthcare.
$C: Why do the largest internet providers want NN gone? If it's meant to allow for more competitive markets, why would they want more competition? 
$C: Isn't nice to have equal opportunity to say this?
$C: It's a little more nuanced than that, but for the quick internet comment, it starts the point. Basically, I believe that we have the issues we do because of local governments allowing geographically small monopolies, keeping competition out of the marketplace, giving Comcast and the like no reason to improve upon customer service or any of the other issues we have with them. I don't trust the government on any level to get any of it right. No one is actually looking out for the average Joe, just wanting to keep themselves in office to line their pockets for minimal work.
$C: Ding ding ding ding.  This guy has got it.

You look at some of these major telecom companies and they controlled all aspects of the chain, production, transportation, etc.

$C: It would be difficult, but not impossible.  Same with the internet.

Also, clean(?) running water is a utility.  Not water itself.  You don't absolutely need it to survive but it would be a hassle to try.

We can agree to disagree on my statement, though I still agree with your examples.  They are good examples, as well.
$C: Nah, most people do. You? Apparently not.
$C: Are you talking about how no one randomly chosen off the streets will know what net neutrality is about. If so that is correct because net neutrality and the "freedom of the internet act"(paraphrasing) are confusing to understand at first.
$C: And people like their guns. 
$C: Or they just support republicans no matter what because of their pride
$C: Low info voters?  You must be talking about all the poor fucks in cities that cant afford education because of democrats
$C: Funny how you feel a device designed to kill other people is supposed to be your God-given right and how the internet, which you literally cannot function in the modern world, isn't.


Your priorities are out of whack.
$C: “PC culture” that the democrats espouse, like, uhh, treating people decently and not being racist/homophobic/transphobic. yeah, thats so hard, poor republicans! 
$C: This, right here.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Found the fatcat
$C: The simple, unnuanced answer to "why...?" is "Because that's what the republicans are doing." 

We have only two parties. They're basically forced to self-identify as opposites in order to get votes. Whatever the repubs do, the dems don't do because it gets them elected. If you think that's not possible, recall that in the early 20th century it was the Democrat party who catered to big business and oligarchs and repeatedly fought against civil rights measures. That started to become the republican m.o. in later decades, and the dems consequently have changed their game to stay in opposition to the GOP. 

Like I said at the beginning, this is simple and unnuanced--there are a lot of things going on, including some truly conscientious people, and some people who are motivated by pure ideology, and other forces I can't even think of. BUT, this is why I like to remind people that the Democrats are not a "good" party, they are a "not as bad" party. 
$C: Correct. That the democrats' interests align with ~~the public's~~ ours is a matter of luck. Does anyone really believe that all those Dems voted for net neutrality because they think it's the right thing and not because it's become an issue over which millions of Americans have vocalized their intention to vote for whoever supports NN? This is about winning seats and making bucks. 
$C: > Lol. Explain why the GOP is literally (yes, literally) ALWAYS on the wrong side then?

Because when your mind is consumed by tribalism, you create the fiction in your mind that your ingroup can do no wrong and your outgroup can do no right.
$C: Well the recent omnibus hardly came from souly Republicans as the opposal rate was roughly the same( 41% from the Democrats and 39% from Republicans) and Trump signed that. I also think the last thing he'd do is veto a bill passed by both the house and the Senate that the public strongly wants to see to pass. This would generate an enormous amount of flack in the media which is the last thing he needs right now

Edit: forgot the percent sign after 39
$C: Isn’t that a presidential power? To veto laws passed by congress?
$C: Well Comcast having a monopoly in areas is a different issue. Their practices are customer gauging - I agree.

The problem with the monopoly is then there is not incentive to build the original fiber to the home, it is after all Comcast who installed  $20,000 of cabling to get to your neighborhood, let alone $2000 to get from the neighborhood box to your home.

What should happen is the bandwidth to the home should be resold on an open market. So we would have more low-tier bandwidth resellers like MintSim does for reselling T-Mobile service. ($15 a month by the way MintSim is the great)
$C: Into exile, I must go. Failed, I have.
$C: It's not really republicans who squash municipal internet. It's more that the states made certain agreements with ISPs that have no compete stipulations in them. When those agreements expire they can be renegotiated without those stipulations but until such time the ISPs can point to those agreements and get a court to shut you down. 
$C: If free markets for ISPs and the internet giants would exist in the real world, net neutrality may not be as necessary as it is right now.
$C: Fake net neutrality only applies to ISPs, not massive communications platforms like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google. Those platforms now have almost total control over online information and are now blocking access to content, censoring or shutting out users and manipulating what data consumers can and can’t see online. This is increasingly becoming standard practice for Silicon Valley.

Proponents of Obama’s net neutrality often cite a dozen “examples” of ISPs blocking or throttling since 2005, but each case is extremely weak, was immediately fixed, or was a network management issue.

They even work with foreign governments to silence voices online that don’t fit political agendas.
$C: No they do, but it’s less and they still vote against them
$C: And anyone who doesn’t believe they’re self serving, is either extremely naive or just willfully ignorant. 
$C: That was legal under NN just to let you know ruled by DC courts 
$C: That already happens though. ISPs are allowed to offer plans with different speeds. 
$C: What was it?
$C: They just want less restrictions so the rich can get richer and continue to screw over the little guy. 
$C: So you want Net Neutrality repealed?

That's what "Not Ajit" entails

$C: **Berkeley, California**

Berkeley ( BURK-lee) is a city on the east shore of San Francisco Bay in northern Alameda County, California. It is named after the 18th-century Anglo-Irish bishop and philosopher George Berkeley. It borders the cities of Oakland and Emeryville to the south and the city of Albany and the unincorporated community of Kensington to the north. Its eastern border with Contra Costa County generally follows the ridge of the Berkeley Hills.

$C: He can and he will. Too much corporate interest for him to do otherwise. So much for "drain the swamp", but that's no shocker.

In the minds of r/the_donald he's an evil n****r who ruined the Streak of 43 white dudes in an equally white house, among other things. 
$C: He let CitiBank pick nearly his entire cabinet then let all the banks off with not even a slap on the wrist.
$C: It's been explained already. Shit you only need to look into the history of why we needed it to tell you why it's a good thing.

At some point, nobody cares to explain it to people who won't listen.
$C: And if reddit is not important enough to be subject to the same sort of regulation, why is it important enough to be pushing for it?
$C: It’s perfectly legal for someone to provide the KKK electricity and ban them from having a rally at their establishment, this argument is like saying I’m required to allow you to come into a bar and harass people when your only right is to ask for a drink.
$C: Reddit comments and conversations can come across as aggressive or argumentative and that’s genuinely not how I want to approach this. You and I are both arguing for the same thing but you’re applying the correct concept in the wrong places. There are definitely industries where government regulation would act as a barrier to competition, but the mistake you’re making is assuming that’s true for all industries. We both want the free market to take over and allow that to regulate the industry but when it comes to providing internet service the free market alone isn’t enough. The industry is what’s known as a natural monopoly.

> A natural monopoly is a type of monopoly that exists due to the high fixed or start-up costs of conducting a business in a specific industry. Additionally, natural monopolies can arise in industries that require unique raw materials, technology or similar factors to operate. Since it is economically sensible to have some monopolies like these, governments allow them to exist, but provide regulation, ensuring consumers get a fair deal.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/natural_monopoly.asp

This has been an issue from the very of Cable broadcasting.

> The mainstream conservatives at the heart of the Nixon administration felt strongly that cable's “natural monopoly” of distribution facilities—it was so expensive to install that it made sense to have just one in each town—created a risk of the cable operators’ becoming gatekeepers of information.

Parsons, Blue Skies, 344–46.

 But what does work and allow for truly free competition is a small amount of government regulation to level the playing field. In fact that’s exactly what the govt did that allowed the Cable industry to prosper. It’s late and I don’t want to get into it now but look up the poll attachment issues between AT&T and the early cable companies. 
$C: In my neighborhood there isn’t really a free market, just Comcast, which is the larger issue with ISP based capitalism: the playing field is so skewed to large companies that there’s no room for newcomers to steal those unhappy customers in many places.
$C: great. Just start an ISP company and start laying millions of dollars of copper.

Oh, wait, Comcast says you have to pay their technician at every telephone pole to make sure that your stuff doesn't mess with theirs. You will also have to pay AT&T's technician to come out and Wow's technician to come out.

ISP's have rigged state rules to prevent new comers. Look at all the trouble Google Fiber ran into with state rules. States that try to change the rules get lawsuits from the ISP's.

To enter the market as an even small ISP, you need millions of dollars. I could set up a web business tomorrow with a couple hundred bucks. Why do you want to write the rules to expand the control of the companies in the market with the cost of entry of millions of dollars at the expense of the market with a cost of entry of hundreds? Under what delusional world is that pro competition?
$C: If that were an option, it would have happened a long time ago. It's prohibitively expensive to build the infrastructure necessary to do this. Deregulation won't change that.
$C: Apparently you missed where I said that nn is more complicated than the issues I provided. See, I was responding to "extreme irony in Reddit fighting for the government . . . ."


That's like saying it would be ironic if I told Congress to shut its filthy mouth when it tries to stop me from telling you to shut your filthy mouth. It mighy seem hypocritical or ironic at first, until you realize that there is a difderence between me and the government.


See, just because I want to tell you to shut your filthy mouth, that doesn't mean I want the government to make you shut your filthy mouth.


Now, like I said, nn is more complicated than that, but assuming you underst and the difference between govt.and not-govt, let's muddy the waters.


Electricity. Your electrict company won't give you power unless you shut your filthy mouth or pay an additional fee. Now, Electric Co. isn't the government, but they still cannot do this. Unfortunately, they have to provide electric to the Nazi meetings, Trump rallies, and your filthy mouth, no matter what. And they can't charge extra based on what you say. The government gets to regulate this.


Now, It's still more complicated than "isn't internet different from electricity?" Certainly there is a survivability issue when it comes to power, water and heat, which doesn't exist with the internet. Additionally ISPs haven't been given the same "monopoly" status that utility companies have. But, that's another can of bullshit flavored worms.


My point isn't to defend nn on a constitutional level. My point is that there's no irony in r/thedonald banning me for saying Repiblicans in Congress are sacks of shit who shouldn't control my speech. That's because there's a difference between govt and private entities.
$C: Speaking of naziism, I just realized I said "fiest amendmemt." That sounds like the nazi version of freedom of speech. "government csnnot regulate speech unless it talks bad about the government or fails to further a government purpose. The penalty for violating this fiest amendment is death."
$C: **Marsh v. Alabama**

Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U.S. 501 (1946), was a case decided by the United States Supreme Court, in which it ruled that a state trespassing statute could not be used to prevent the distribution of religious materials on a town's sidewalk, even though the sidewalk was part of a privately owned company town. The Court based its ruling on the provisions of the First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment.

"Marsh v.

Good Bot!
$C: Fair enough, I just think that's a pretty bad false equivalency.

Let's say you have a neighbor who doesn't let you eat meat whenever you're in their apartment. Then one day, your landlord makes a rule that you need to pay $100 extra a month if you want to eat meat anywhere in the building. If the neighbor fights that new rule, does that make them a hypocrite?

Superficially it could look that way because they appear to share the same values, but not if you really think about it. One is controlling behavior in their personal space and the other is trying to control it in a space they are renting to others. The landlord also stands to profit from the rule, unlike the neighbor. You can argue whether either party is being fair, but I don't see how you could argue that the neighbor's personal rules mean they have no credibility in an argument against the landlord.

$C: If we got down into the details of net neutrality, like in the above comment and comments surrounding this one, it'd be clear that the left doesn't care about anything they pretend to.

This is how it always starts. I'm sure the FCC started for something banal like regulating the height of Radio towers and now it's expanded into a giant bureaucracy that tells talk show hosts what kind of dick joke they can make.
$C: There is no example I know of from ISPs blocking websites unless at the request of the government.

So you really want to put more power in the hands of government to police the internet, which is what Net Neutrality will do as they expand its legislation?

$C: [Here's a list of all the times ISPs have tried to violate net neutrality.](https://np.reddit.com/r/KeepOurNetFree/comments/7ej1nd/fcc_unveils_its_plan_to_repeal_net_neutrality/dq5hlwd/?sh=45a33b81&st=JAA62V5F) It's extremely naiive to think that we'll be fine without it in place.

I get that you're over here trying to feel intellectually superior to these poor libtard plebians, but please at least do a little research into your views before you go around insulting people's brainpower?
$C: /r/iamverysmart
$C: For “decades”? You're aware it's only 2018, right? The web may have been around for over 20 years, but it didn't start actually picking up speed and accessibility until, like, 02, give or take. I don't know about you, but I certainly prefer 2010 internet over 90s net.
$C: So what would you suggest as an alternative? Allow the free market to adjust? Lighter touch regulation?
$C: How dare you form your own opinion after researching the topic.
$C: I’m the same way as you. I think all the examples used as to why NN was good was to the absolute extreme. 

If these companies imposed unreasonable data caps and blocked access to websites, what is stopping me or anyone else from finding another provider, possibly even a new one, without all of the caps and throttling etc.?


$C: Could you please explain your reasoning a little more? From what I've read there, they say that it creates network congestion which prevents the internet from growing and being open. But this makes the assumption that ISPs will use it to improve the functionallity of the internet and help it grow, when there is nothing stopping them from censoring certain websites and selectively allowing traffic to stifle competition and contribute to their own goals. What designates certain data traffic prioritization as "for the greater good"?

>Allowing broadband service providers to innovate freely and differentiate their networks will enable them to provide consumers with to enhanced service offerings and richer content.

This statement is pretty vague and overly optimistic. "Differentiating their networks" sounds good on paper but leads to the very real and likely possibility of them using their networks, (which are under regional monopolies to prevent any competition or "free market" ideas), to actively stifle competition and innovation on the internet?
$C: Great article, thanks for sharing

$C: They tried making netflix pay for being a bandwidth hog. That is all this whole fuss is about, to stop streaming services from getting more expensive.
$C: >Nobody was clamoring for this...ever. 

83% of the country was for keeping NN.

Thanks in part to us having NN in place for a dozen years

Are you seriously trying to say deregulation is why we have cell phones now? Holy shit
$C: > Nobody was clamoring for this...ever

Wrong. This has been in the works for a very long time, even before Reddit.  Telecoms have been making a push for this for a long time and because off those moves NN had to be introduced to stop what they were doing.

This isn't a political issue, it's a technological issue where telecoms are trying to take something they can't control and enact more control and profit from it.

If you are pro small business and pro-entrepreneurs you need to be pro NN. 
$C: net neutrality has been the policy of the fcc since 2005. The internet is getting better and better under net neutrality.

The government already has its nose stuck in ISP's. State rules forced Google Fiber to go through many hoops as a newcomer to the industry. ISP's are already anti\-competitive. Ending net neutrality let's ISP's take over internet content markets by blocking their internet content competitors at the gate. 
$C: It was sarcastic enthusiasm 
$C: Yea them the same people who traded 5 Iraqi generals for one American traitor also the same people who are ok with killing unborn babies matter of fact the top 5 most dangerous cities are hardcore blue so yea those Democrats the same ones who who say let's legalize certain weed because banning doesn't work but then propose to ban guns other shit.Net neutrality isn't a end all be all we lived with out it before we can live without it again the net neutrality act  wasn't finished completely untill 2015 I believe.
$C: You know you're voting for a government controlled and regulated internet right?

If everything goes south in forty years, trump jr will have the power to censor your internet the same way China does to its citizens. That's what you're voting for. It's astounding the way democrats put a nice sounding title and you all lap it up without knowing the first thing about it. You'll be the first to start crying when it's used against you.

$C: The FTC hasn't acted on these constant mergers and monopolies the ISP's have been gathering in a long time. Letting the FCC regulate them sounds a lot better than watching the FTC continue to do nothing.
$C: >So you think that the party that constantly votes anti-consumer  
  
Didn't realize that the FCC and FTC are now political parties... I was referring to Republican's, as anything they vote for usually helps companies at the expense of the consumer.  
    
The FCC, or Federal Communications Commission, is in charge of regulating interstate communications. I think the internet falls under the category of "interstate communications"...
$C: Well to be honest, it was a complete joke but the sarcasm didn’t come across. I’ll keep it, because now I’m interested how many downvotes it’s going to get.

Too bad, he didnt help stop his own party. He doesnt deserve a decision. Why should the opposing side care to whatever he has to say?
$C: Well I'm an independent so I don't know what you mean by "you people". All that shit is irrelevant to what I was saying, all I'm saying is if he was to let a bill that protects basic consumer rights stay alive, it might make people like him a bit more. I don't really stick to either side, and people like you are a big reason why.

$C: you may actually be one of the most unintelligent misinformed idiots I have ever seen on this website, and I don’t mean that lightly.

kanye west is a rapper. His involvement with politics is minimal and forgettable, skill in producing music irrelevant.

“DEFEATING ISIS” are you an idiot? How did he defeat ISIS? ISIS is still alive and very well.

BRINGING PEACE TO NK. This is actually the dumbest thing I saw. This accounts for 90% of why I think you’re an idiot. What the fuck did trump even REMOTELY do that had ANYTHING to do with north korea and south korea having talks?

“MAKING THEM DENUCLEARIZE” they didn’t denuclearize they **stopped testing nukes** which doesn’t mean they’re no longer producing nukes, it could easily mean that they have perfected the nukes they need. Trump isn’t even involved here.

You listed his approval rating twice like its extra special. Approval rating doesn’t mean shit. Even if he has a high approval rating, what on earth does that have to do with his skill as a president? It simply means most people like him. And if you have the brain capacity of the average voter then approval ratings mean nothing.

“tax cuts” benefit the rich. if you are rich, which is highly unlikely based off your nonsensical paragraph, then congrats because this is the first accurate statement you made.

hillary clinton. Hillary fucking clinton. Hillary clinton and barack obama. They are literally irrelevant now. Their names mean NOTHING unless you are discussing a policy enacted when obama was president. Otherwise, pointless names listed purely to jerk yourself off to the concept of being a republican despite sane republicans not giving a shit about obama or hillary.

your last sentence is nonsense as well. Absolute nonsense.

In hindsight this is probably a troll post but I really don’t care anymore. Also, feel free to point out false statements I’ve made, i’ll happily debate them.
$C: is this some kind of performance art?
$C: Yep, that's pretty much a dumb statement 
$C: Trump has the lowest approval ratings in modern history.

Obama has some of the highest approval ratings in modern history, rivaling and even surpassing Reagan.

Do you see why people feel you are not based in reality when you make statements like these?
$C: all Kanye west did was tweet a few times, and he's not being received well. 

look at how north Korea just cancelled the peace talks. the jury isn't out yet on this one

now don't get me wrong, the economy is great under trump. but did it just suddenly go through the roof \(he did bring in some improvements aka rich people get richer\) or was there somebody before who helped it grow? hmm......

$C: Good, can't wait until Big Government takes their hands off my internet connection.
$C: this is an obnoxious bot.
$C: > Nobody will pay more to use Google.

Unlikely. I'm sure anyone with Android devices would consider it. As would many people who use Gmail, Youtube, Google Music and other services. 

But assume you're right and trying to get consumers to pay more to access services wouldn't be viable. How about companies paying to block or degrade access to competitors? Do you think Microsoft would shy away from paying an large ISP huge amounts of money to throttle Google and Apple services and uncap speeds to Microsoft's services? How much do you think it'd be worth for brick and mortar retailer to come together, pool their money and pay off every ISP in the country to eliminate all access to Amazon, Ebay and other online only competitors by US consumers?

And yeah, we got services like Netflix, Hulu and Satellite TV. But if cable companies could have decided not to allow access to those competing services, how successful do you think those services would be? We already know they would want to do things that because they **did** do those kinds of things, [repeatedly](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/timothy-karr/net-blocking-a-problem-in_b_5695997.html). 

> It's almost like when someone is overcharging you, others see a market opportunity to charge you less for superior service.

If the Internet was just a service, yeah. But it's a service that requires vast amounts of infrastructure, like an analog phone or electric company. 

Incumbent ISPs enjoyed a slew of tax incentives, grants, public funding and legislative support to get that infrastructure installed initially. And in more than 20 states, that legislative support included open-ended guarantees against competition to roll out that infrastructure. So to compete, you'd just need a high level of state-level legislative support to allow you to compete with the incumbent ISPs at all, then you'd need city-level support to gain the ability to dig up city streets and neighborhoods to lay out the needed infrastructure. 

I'm sure having half a dozen companies all digging up their streets and laying down a rats' nest of wires everywhere so they could compete with incumbent ISPs would cause absolutely no problems for cities so they'd be happy to open up competition in the ISP market to anyone willing to provide such a service. Easy peasy! And I'm certain companies will be lining up to do that with no regulations at all to protect the massive investment required from some bigger company with more money paying upstream providers to block their customers access to the Internet anyway and rendering their investment a useless waste of vast amounts of time and money. /s


$C: Actually I'm going with how it works in other countries where NN doesn't exist. American ISPs are salivating to get in on that double-dip tiered action.
$C: Net neutrality was enacted in response to ISPs going down this road.

For example in 2007 Comcast was found to be blocking bittorrent. \(While torrenting is sometimes used for piracy it also has many legitimate and legal uses.\)

In 2012 ATT started blocking Facetime for its customers unless they subscribed to a "Mobile Share" plan.

They definitely have plans for how they will use the lack of neutrality to increase profits at our expense.
$C: Net Neutrality doesn't make all companies transfer data at the same rate, just without prejudice like you said. You can still have Comcast offering 100mbps and Verizon FIOZ offering 1000mpbs, NN has nothing to do with that. NN just says that all data must be treated equal, that means they can't impose slowdowns on specific services because they are data hungry. This leads to either the service get extorted (like how Netflix pays these companies to not throttle our data) or the customer getting extorted (where they would offer you a "streaming plan" for another $10 a month that you would have to buy to stream in HD, otherwise they would throttle your speeds. 

If you pay for 100mbps, you should be able to use that 100mbps for whatever you want, that's all that NN is. It doesn't limit the speeds of anyone, they're welcome to increase their speeds, which they should have done with the 200+ billion in tax cuts they took to build Fiber. Instead, they throttle heavy users because their infrastructure is outdated and can't handle the rising amount of data being transferred as we move forward. The thing is, the infrastructure was funded that it should be state of the art. I currently get 25mbps, but if I had Fiber that number would range from 500-1000mbps. My state already paid for Fiber to be put in by giving telecom companies tax breaks to do it, now their old infrastructure is strained because they haven't upgraded and they're saying it's the fault of the companies/consumers that are using all this data suddenly.
$C: Let's also end electric neutrality while we're at it. General Electric can zero rate Samsung appliances and charge more for others.
$C: So... you can't... build a modem??
Do you also not have a certificate declaring you do not have DONKEY BRAINS?
$C: He's spouting ignorance on a topic he doesn't know about, while trying to act like he knows how the internet works. His post is literally him arguing for a side he doesn't even understand but goes along with because he saw it on t_d. Not really worried about your downvote bub.
$C: Bitches about supposed insults then calls me a faggot. Nice. Like I said, you sure type a lot without saying much. Have a good one
$C: [Here you go my dude] (https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8i3382/comment/dypcgwu)

Scroll down to the comment, it's a well-cited list of all the things Republicans have voted as a bloc for that involve taking away civil liberties and giving power to big business. 
$C: But the telcos already have a billion dollar lobbying setup.  Anti-pot people don't, so there's not exactly a lot of pressure on the government to act on states legalizing pot.

I'm actually surprised the telcos or the Feds haven't already challenged the state law just on the grounds that the FCC is already in charge of regulating communications.  I can't imagine it going unchallenged if a state, for example, prohibiting radio companies from broadcasting on a certain FM frequency that is already allowed by the FCC.  Or setting different 'decency' guidelines.

As far as investing much into exploiting NN, they weren't really doing that before NN existed so I wouldn't say the laws are acting as a deterrent.

$C: Different speed packages are not forbidden. You can advertise whatever plan you want as long as it treats data equally. 

Data caps already are a travesty and have no place on home internet. 
$C: This idiotic screed you've written could be applied to any law what so ever.

You could apply it to murder laws.

Or speed limits.

Any law can be painted as restricting when you use this broad of a brush.  But this isn't even about individual freedom.  Net Neutrality doesn't limit your freedom in any more than electric saftey regulations limit your freedom.  They are regulations on CORPORATIONS who wield a lot of undue power and influence.  

Coaching it in words like "freedom" is just trying to muddy the waters since in the end the only "freedom" being restricted is the corporations ability to charge you based on content they don't in any way own.

Net Neutrality is about making sure ISP's can't steal the internet as their own.

So take your idiotic definition of freedom and shove it.
$C: Yes it will, but NN has and will harm backbone providrers and benefit google, netflix and other big companies who use alot of traffic. The current infrastructure isn't built to handle this kind of traffic which is why you never can have the speed that was promised 24/7. I couldn't care less about the ISPs as they are just the middlemen. But it is simply too expensive to build out infrastructure that can support the amount of traffic that comes through with the current technology. If they were allowed to throttle the data traffic from the largest companies they could afford building out. But NN shuts that down. If we look at statistics we can see that Netflix alone in 2016 stood for 30% of the internet traffic sucking up bandwith from other services. They could expand the infrastructure but then the data plans would be too expensive for consumers too pay.

NN is good for consumers who live in places with already well built infrastructure and a plethora of ISPs to choose from, but bad for rural areas which have limited options since NN makes it tough too expand for backbone providers. 
$C: Repeat after me,you are arguing with redditors.

Again,you are arguing with redditors.

I don’t believe laws should be created on “just in case” scenarios. You can ask “what if?” forever. If it’s not broke, don’t fix it. Every law introduced is a freedom removed. 
$C: No. Competion between companies is what would be the downfall of freedom on the internet. Do you know nothing about why people are frustrated with this? If we let the telecom companies have full control, they'll be able to block and throttle your internet when you visit certain sites. I.e. if Comcast was like, "hey, whoever ('whoever' being online businesses like YouTube, Amazon, Netflix, etc.) gives us the most money, can have the highest bandwidth to their site. They would be within their full rights to do so. Or if politically fueled telecom companies wanted to block websites on the opposing side, they would also be within their full rights. Which is why net neutrality exists. Its not the govt. controlling the internet, it's the government regulating what ISPs can do with our first amendment rights.
$C: How can you be so sure they will use it like in a way that benefits you? The more likely scenerio is that they will throttle Netflix for normal users and give a paid option to unlock the speed you had before. Plus, how exactly is it any different on their end what websites you use? What matters for them cost-wise (if anything) is how much bandwidth you use, not what websites you visit. If you buy a Netflix only package, are you not just arteficially restricting yourself?
$C: It actually is.

Republicans' "official" stance is less government, more trust in people. Their shtick has been (since the party shift a long time ago) that more government regulations = bad. To a Republican eye, the government enforcing neutrality is inherently bad simply because the government is enforcing it. 

They spin it as "cramping the free market" and "infringing on the rights of entrepeneurs" without acknowledging that those entrepeneurs have already shown themselves more than willing to screw over the common person to get more money. Republican faith in the goodness of humanity is childish and idealistic at best. 

Meanwhile the Democratic stance is that safeguarding the common people is worth the extra effort of government enforcement. This is why they tend to be liberal, tend to fight for underdogs, and are on the side of net neutrality. 
$C: From TechCrunch:

*Even if we were to allow that the rules in the 2015 order aren’t in danger of removal (they are), the argument is they don’t need Title II authority to work. They do, and this is supported by years of attempts.*

*The FCC tried for the decade before 2015 to enforce non-discrimination and other net neutrality rules using other legal authorities as a basis. Several different tracks were taken: ancillary authority under Title I and Section 706, both of which were rejected by courts as being insufficient for these kinds of strong rules. Hints that Title II was the only way to go have been dropped court after court and eventually the FCC took them at their word.*

*The FCC’s proposal provides no alternatives for authorities under which it would be able to enforce the rules — except for ones already tried and found lacking.*

*Make no mistake, the rules will not work without Title II. This isn’t speculation — it’s already been tried.*

Also from techcrunch:

*As a last consideration here, the opponents of net neutrality have characterized it as protecting against “phantom” offenses that have not yet occurred. Leaving aside that this is the purpose and definition of preventative regulation, many of the issues brought up by the smaller ISPs and magnified by FCC leadership are equally phantasmal. Potential problems cannot be considered worth accommodating at this scale but ignored at the larger scale of national ISPs.*
$C: It's true that regulations and permits are a major part of the expense, but you also need to buy "space" on current lines if you're not laying your own. Just because the cables are there doesn't mean you can use them whenever.

Major ISPs are also notorious for filing lawsuits over silly things the *second* someone encroaches on "their" space, designed specifically to bleed the bank of any would-be competition. Big ISPs have huge legal budgets and startups often can't deal with the delays and red tape thrown up by the lawsuits, even if they're in the right.

Investors won't touch new ISPs because it often takes 5+ years for the consumer base to grow enough to overturn the initial sink even if there AREN'T any lawsuits filed.

There's just no non-government-regulated way to get enough competition flowing to threaten the major companies.
$C: Because there are hundreds of cereal options and no one in their right mind would pay that much for one brand. They'll just buy different cereal.

In the US however, the vast majority of Americans only have one or two ISPs available. There's so little competition that you realistically can't just buy internet from a different company. That's why we need some regulations to make sure we aren't forced to deal with the whims of an oligopoly.
$C: Good human.
$C: Yes, if we give ISPs all the powers they will suddenly start sharing their land lines and give half the country more than one choice, right? Net neutrality isn't even about solving those problems, but about not allowing them to police content however they want, because internet should be a shared and equal source.

But hey, nice job on pushing back with the propaganda, Николай Яков, with a 1-day old account that only posted against net neutrality.
$C: I'm uneducated here. Can you show me anything detailing how exactly this situation was caused by the government and competition was stifled?
$C: and that has absolutely nothing to do with net neutrality.

$C: >. One vote matters, but it'll take the whole state to fix the level of greedy incompetence at the state level.

Its about censorship in combination with laws like "The Countering Foreign Information amd Propaganda Act" passed in Dec of 2016 attached to the NDAA.

Operation Choke Point style subpeonas aimed at ISP's to shit down ANY Website the Current GOV doesnt like for any reasoning.

And you wont be told why.
$C: Data that comes from content providers such as Netflix *needs* to be prioritized because of the nature of it and the order of the packages matter. Given how much network bandwidth Netflix uses, this creates *extraordinary* strain on managing networks, which drives up the costs. Right now, that cost is spread onto all the users of the network, even those who don't use Netflix. 

They're wouldn't be charging Netflix more to access those customers. They're charging Netflix more because Netflix needs prioritized data. Netflix currently gets a free ride. They get to charge their customers less, and the costs they cause on the network get distributed to everyone, so it's not reflected in the true cost of providing that service.

What's happening right now is a deadweight loss. The *total* cost of providing Netflix isn't accurately reflected because of the network externalities. 

Here's a paper: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1585254

>According to the models, the only unambiguous beneficiaries of net neutrality regulation are content providers: Consumers are unambiguously worse off under net neutrality, while the effect on platform operators is ambiguous

>. If a more realistic profit ratio is imposed, the authors’ proof that net neutrality is surplus-enhancing no longer holds. I employ numeric simulations to decompose the factors underlying this reversal. The results indicate that net neutrality may function as a vehicle for transferring surplus from consumers and platform operators to content providers, rather than creating surplus. The losses sustained by consumers and platform operators under net neutrality outweigh any gains enjoyed by content providers as the profit ratio is adjusted to less empirically implausible levels, ***which leads to deadweight loss under net neutrality***.

> We also evaluate claims by net neutrality proponents that regulation is justified by the existence of externalities between the demand for Internet access and content services. We show that such interrelationships are more complex than claimed by net neutrality proponents and do not provide a compelling rationale for regulation. We conclude that antitrust enforcement and/or more limited regu- latory mechanisms provide a better framework for addressing competitive con- cerns raised by proponents of net neutrality.


Keep in mind, Netflix is an example I'm using. This doesn't only apply to them, and it applies to virtually any service that requires data to be prioritized. 
$C: She still effectively subsidizing it because email (at least most) doesn't require prioritization as it moves through the network, so, even controlling for bandwidth, she still creates less strain on the network than someone streaming netflix does. 
$C: Many ISPs already enacted violating policies on their services. For example, giving a website or service (such as facebook or netflix) priority traffic (or not counting it toward a bandwidth cap) is one of the things net neutrality protects ISPs from doing.

NN says that all data should be treated equally. One gigabyte should be treated no differently than any other gigabyte, since at the end of the day residential ISPs have no business even knowing what you're accessing, let alone fuck with it.
$C: FYI, you shouldn't believe anything people tell you on reddit, because most people here are misinformed, or just plain lie. 
$C: To stop it from being dissolved
$C: If the FCC could prove that Comcast was throttling, that might have been a violation of the 2010 FCC Open Internet Order.  

Under those rules, Comcast could charge for network upgrades, including adding netflix servers to Comcast datacenters. I believe Comcast at least claimed that they weren't intentionally slowing down netflix.
$C: Most of us aren't Cable Company CEOs so no, we wont see any benefit.
$C: Its not a dice roll. 

It makes it legal for Comcast to throttle Netflix.

Why would I like this?
$C: They would also completely control what type of media you consume. They decided that they don’t like a certain website because it spreads views that might hurt them, they could have full control to restrict and block that site completely. Again, also worst case scenario. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: If only those corporations hadn't grown so powerful that they literally installed cable company lobbyists as the head of most regulatory committees. 
$C: Don't forget about the Apple gulags and that time Exxon put everyone in internment camps.

Or how Amazon can demand 30 percent of your money, and throw you in jail if you decide you don't want to pay.

$C: You know what's really scary?

A world in which corporations own all the labor by virtue of owning all the robots. Human workers are being phased out faster and faster by automation. When corporations have all the money and you have none, when they have all the value in production and you have none...

...what are you going to be worth to anyone?
$C: Well, it hasn't happened yet. Wait until robots provide a majority of all basic labor and corporations don't have to pay taxes on said robots. Social programs will die. Humans will, by and large, become useless. Then the people with all the money will be saying 'Ah, look at these droves of angry, jobless people. They seem like a threat to my money. Murder them.'

That's whats going to happen.

Corporations have already managed to embroil America in the Iraq war for the sake of oil. Plenty of needless death there.
$C: Good thing we established a corporation after leaving the British Empire.
$C: first off, you lack a grasp on history. The vast majority of people who eventually ended up coming over to America did so for job and land prospects. By the time the revolution had started anyone who had fled  persecution in england had been living in the colonies for over 150 some years, they were hardly being oppressed anymore. The revolution was started by people who were already firmly entrenched in the colonies by at least a generation.

Second, are you really trying to compare the monarchist government of England hundreds of years ago to the current democratic government of the united states?

Corporations have all the real power in America now. Not the government. 
$C: Ad Hominem fallacies are not an argument. Nice try though. You really gave it your best shot.
$C: That's ridiculous. ISPs have locked down any chance of competion with regional monopolies. Most people only have 1 or 2 ISPs in their area, and its always the big ones. Plus they lobby and actively prevent new competitors from entering their areas, which is why services like Google Fiber have had such a hard time. ISPs don't give a rat's ass about what you think of them. What are you gonna do, boycott them? Most Americans have no alternatives, and I can assure you that once one starts pushing it, they all will.

It isn't in their best interest to have good relations with customers, its in their best interests to fuck you over for more money.
$C: Did you even look at my comment? The idea is that while ISPs have not taken advantage of it on a large scale yet, they have proven time and time again that their goal is to do that, and that their intention is to take advantage of the absence of NN. It's silly to think that they would immediately start implementing it immediately after the protections go away anyways, it just doesn't work like that.
$C: Was being the key word. ISPs began testing the water and were installing more new tools to play with. What started out as quality of service infrastructure expanded into deep package inspection, modification, and analysis tools. The first instances people probably remember was Comcast blocking BitTorrent by forging packets and sending them to their customers. [Cases from there began to grow](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/6d957x/website_packages_from_your_isp_its_coming/di0zyxe/).

One of the most troubling things realized early on was how stealthy these approaches could be. Comcast's approach of forging packets appeared to be done in such a way that the people on either end blamed the other for the connection issues and assumed a networking error. In a free market online an ISP could use such techniques and targeted a number of services they didn't like. Luckily they were rather lazy with a few projects and throttled and dropped packets to such a degree and consistency for absolutely no reason that it raised a lot of flags that they were inteferring with services for competitive reasons. Often customers only noticed when ISPs began pushing their limits on how much they could get away with. It's still not even clear how many projects that ISPs had or were testing before they were told that they couldn't use those practices.

Hilarious if true (it clearly isn't).

Did you think the people who voted Trump would have not voted for him without Reddit?  Even if the site did not exist the outcome would have remained the same.

I will never understand why people get so furious over something so trivial as a president they don't agree with.  If it honestly affected your day to day life in any tangible way I'd be shocked.  Life is easier when you just ignore politics and focus on yourself.  
$C: 1. You implied it.

2. Literally every republican I know (and I live in Indiana so I know a lot of them) is for net neutrality. And just because Congress is full of lobbyist ass-eating, that doesn't mean that the average informed citizen, right or left leaning, endorses the FCC's decision.

3. The Russians mainly used Facebook. And any bot on Reddit posting trump propoganda was downvoted pretty heavily unless they posted on a page that already supported trump.

$C: Are you mad that the government stepped in and stopped child labor too?
$C: Based on your original comment i don't even thunk you know what net neutrality is..
$C: And that has everything to do with their lack of a First Amendment and nothing to do with their Net Neutrality laws.
$C: ooo, tough words by someone who manages to get triggered by words on an internet forum ;)
$C: From 2005 to just a few months ago the internet has acted as a near perfect free market, free of outside influence. This was because of Net Neutrality. NN was a rule by the govt (your "govt intervention") specifically aimed at ISPs that all traffic must be treated equally. This rule and the free marketplace of internet commerce can co-exist together because that govt rule doesn't affect anyone but ISPs.

Free markets, by definition, are free from ANY outside influence. Typically, most of the influencing has come from governments in the past so that "any influence" becomes "govt influence" to some people. A free market is free if it is free from all influence. A rule telling ISPs not to influence traffic, is a regulation, but doesn't influence the marketplace.

Make sense?
$C: Oh, I see you still don't understand how private platforms work, vs the utilities that allow us access to them.

Twitter doesn't have to host your hate speech if it doesn't want to.
$C: Free market = free from outside influence
$C: Yes , letting ISPs be able to  censor internet is something we want. 

Take away first amendment while you at it
$C: >She isn't up for reelection until 2020.  This probably wasn't some political pandering vote to get reelected.  She has supported net neutrality going back a while.

lots of congressman support those measures. who cares.

>While I probably won't be able to get over the tax vote, you gotta give them props when they make the right vote.

nope. i only give them props when the votes win. collide with the GOP so they always have enough votes is not one of them
$C: Well trump has vetoed a grand total of 0 bills so dont be too doubtful.
$C: My Internet is horrific and we have two choices, both of which are equally bad. We've called customer support over false charges and had customer support tell us it's not their problem. Our Internet randomly cuts out for hours at a time without apology. Both companies know their only competition is each other, so neither of them makes any effort to improve.

The cost of startup for Internet is *ridiculously* high. It's simply impossible for good guy small business Josh to try to set up, it's an area *only* major companies can even afford to try to compete in. There is no free market when the cost of entry is that high.

Since there is already no free market, government protections would only help the common man to not be screwed over by the huge corporations in ISP. Running the Internet like a public utility is common sense at this point, but until we can approach that I'll take the option that makes it less likely I'll be extorted.


$C: There were very little facts and no experts in this video.

$C: I'm sorry you are so woefully misinformed about what net neutrality is. Unfortunately there is a lot of misinformation out there.

Government control is the free market option. Net neutrality has existed since the beginning of the internet, with companies occasionally breaking it.

You wouldn't call trust-busting government control would you?
$C: >So T-mobile's, doesn't discriminate again data?

yeah I didn't say that anywhere. in fact I said there are plenty of examples of this shit behaviour as a basis for why NN is needed.

the rest of the post displays you have a clear misunderstanding about NN.

NN is about ensuring companies providing access to the internet cannot block, throttle, or otherwise restrict access to websites for end users. current NN rules are designed around this goal, but that doesn't mean they are perfect or that because they are imperfect that NN shouldn't be the goal.

Zero rating (tmobile) is an issue, and there is an argument to be made that it violates NN. it hasn't been taken to court yet, and because NN is in the process of being revoked it likely won't unless we somehow restore NN. [here is an article](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/12/not-everyone-can-use-the-cloud-equally/421209/) covering the topic though it doesn't cover possible mechanisms to challenge the practice.

NN isn't about competition. having competition doesn't magically make NN a non-issue.

>people will downvote me regardless of the facts cited.

or they're downvoting because one reason you've cited is a good example why NN is needed, even if the current rules don't explicitly cover it. and the other is completely unrelated to NN.

>lies both parties tell on the subject can't be reduced down to a tweet. 

This isn't a partisan issue anywhere in the country except where lobbyists are paying our government officials to be partisan. I don't give a shit about the letter next to a government officials name, I only care if they are competent and looking out for me. Voting against NN is a direct indicator that the official doesn't give a shit about their constituants.


$C: That's because the rules weren't enacted until 2015 and this all occurred before then. 

The law doesn't stop corporations from pulling this kind of stuff, but it makes it a hell of a lot easier for consumers to sue or class action for this sort of stuff when it does happen.

I know one thing for sure. Moving in the completely opposite direction, even if the 2015 rules weren't perfect, is a step in the wrong direction.
$C: Nah that’s my dad. He’s a little eccentric, sure, but overall he’s dank. 
$C: ....net neutrality has been around since the 90s


It wasn't until 2015 when Verizon was cought purposely slowing down speeds for users who used Netflix in order to promote their shitty streaming service and forced Netflix to pay up that they reinforced the rules so they don't pull that shit again
$C: Good one 
$C: I'm sorry you don't like facts then? Fuck you morons who think net neutrality is somehow bad
$C: [Woah calm down there "Possible Anti-Vaxxer Dad with a smart son"](https://www.reddit.com/r/insanepeoplefacebook/comments/8hpkm8/mods_r_asleep_upvote_actual_insane_person/dylm69s/)
$C: Delete 
$C: And fatigue is a valid concern, I agree. I also don’t have a good answer for that. Waiting in the shadows lets it fade from view and be forgotten. Striking while the iron is hot right now might be pushing too soon given the speed of congress. But also a high intensity but short push can be ignored in the light of reelection campaigns, and right now the struggle may be to even get Paul Ryan to bring it to a vote, never mind the direction the Representatives do vote.

There are those with more experience in timing these things than I. Hopefully they can contribute  to figure out when that should be. I do think it needs to be more than a single push though.
$C: 47 nays, all GOP. I’m sorry man but the fact is the GOP just doesn’t represent reasonable conservatives. I think y’all need to really start rallying and voting in more reasonable (I.e less focused on social issues/posturing, as well as fewer bought out) leaders. 

I hear many conservatives try to distance themselves from “the crazies” but you have no reps. 
$C: If you want to be a champion of the free market, you shouldn't want more regulation that stifles competition and hands more control to the government. The solution is not net "neutrality". The solution is to end municipally-approved monopolies.
$C: I, for one, would like to see folks like you rescue your party from the white supremacist scumbags who hijacked it. Force THEM to the fringe so they have to create their own party.
$C: I'm disappointed you haven't abandoned your dumpster fire of a party 
$C: You need to stop voting against your own interest, or start accepting what your vote is actually doing. You're being lied to, and have been for a while.
$C: Free speech. Don't call yourself conservative if you don't support it. If you don't realize that this is simply an \(obvious\) ploy to suppress speech that Dems don't like, I'm afraid your not very smart. Controlling the verbiage is exactly how a population is controlled. Every evil tyrannical ruler knew it, and they still do. If you're truly conservative please get a clue.
$C: ....I’m not sure you fully understand the idea of a free market
$C: > a conservative republican

A contradiction if there ever was one.
$C: Unfortunately content providers have abused the good will of the public through mass surveillance and censorship while getting a free ride taking advantage of service providers. 

Facebook is a CIA Op (formerly LifeLog), and Amazon has a $600 million CIA contract. Google is run by DARPA. The list goes on.

“Net neutrality” is a farce and it needs to end. #InternetBillOfRights
$C: It is true that there could end up being a choice between the current incumbent and a total wing nut that makes the incumbent the more palatable choice regardless of their stance on net neutrality.

That having been said, these last few years have shown that even extremists can win (or at least come scarily close). A politician cannot sarcastically say “you mean you’re going to vote for *that* guy instead if I don’t support this?” and expect that they are safe. It turns out that a non-negligible number of people *will* vote for that guy. Neglecting potential voters, *even if all they do is not vote at all as a result*, could spell defeat. They need the support of everyone, and we can leverage that in our favor.
$C: I'm all for showing law in its purest source: directly from it.

The bill is Senate Joint Resolution 52 (S. J. Res. 52) Found [here](https://congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/52).

Click Actions. Click Record Vote Number 97. [Tada!](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&session=2&vote=00097)
$C: It probably can't, but there's no guarantee that he'll veto it. Trump is unpredictable. Which is usually terrifying, but in this case, it means there's some hope.
$C: > Republican politicians don't seem to be fully aware that this is a high-priority, nonpartisan issue for voters. They're likely to assume that anyone who cares a lot about NN wasn't going to vote for them anyway.

I’m all for net neutrality, but I really think their assumption is more correct than incorrect - how many republican voters view this as a higher priority than, say, taxes or healthcare?
$C: How are you going to rally people to support your aforementioned causes without a neutral, accessible Internet?
$C: By no means am I advocating that someone should vote based on this single issue, nor do I think they should they decide their vote based on *any* single issue. Our world is too connected to do that. The things you list are also, I think, topics of great importance that should inform any voter’s choice at the polls in combination with this one. They should also be just as active in advocating for all causes they are passionate about.

That said, the fact that there are other issues which are also pressing to our lives does not mean that this one should be neglected or is any less important. We need to advocate for all of those things constantly. Politicians can be swayed, and by making our support of (or opposition to) a given cause public and loud, we can pressure politicians to align with our views in a broader sense lest they find their seat in jeopardy.
$C: Well, think of Americans like they're ancient Roman Imperial citizens. They (we), the common citizen, don't care about the state of the Imperium as long as it isn't crashing upon our heads, are given our bread and our games. 

Except our bread's more like cake than bread, and the internet is our bloodsport.

So pretty much one of the rare times you'll have true bipartisanship is when it's a dire threat to one of those three.
$C: Yes, because net neutrality at least has a chance. Every single issue on your list is dead in the water with a Republican led Congress and Trump in the White House. Zero percent chance of any one of them being changed in even remotely the direction you want the next few years at the least barring things like impeachment and wave elections. Net neutrality has support from conservatives and liberals as long as they understand it. Without the open internet a lot of other things fall apart with it.

$C: Yeah it is. Representatives in the House get 2 years in office, and are elected on even-numbered years. It is a ways out (6 months to be exact), but it’s still their last quarter and they need to start thinking about November.
$C: I think he means that the entire house is up for re-election this year.

Though that's really reading between the lines.
$C: I would be much more willing to consider your stance and consider those in opposition (or indifferent to) net neutrality if there was a simultaneous proposal to remove the anticompetitive laws already in place.  However that's not the case at all, net neutrality is leveling the playing field for consumers so it's the next best thing. I'd rather not give ISPs free reign to completely screw everyone over without having an open market that lets people take their money elsewhere.

Tldr; if they removed regulations limited and helping at the same time I'd consider that, but in the current ISP market we need net neutrality desperately.
$C: It is very much not pointless. 

The president has shown that he can be swayed by what people think of him. His strategists and republican lawmakers will no doubt say that vetoing a bill with bipartisan support amongst voters will be damaging to him and his reelection chances, as well as the chances of his own party in the midterms. Things will get a lot harder for him if Republicans lose their majorities in either house. There’s also the potential fallout from pissing off the congress.

*Even then*, should Trump choose to ignore all that, which isn’t a foregone conclusion, and veto anyway, Congress can still override the veto. Yes, it’s a long shot and uncommon, but we live in uncommon times. Make it clear that the Republican ship is sinking and I am willing to bet a number will jump ship to save their skins.

It is true that this **may** ultimately fail - but deciding the cause is lost already and instead doing nothing will **definitely** fail.
$C: People like you are what’s wrong with politics.
$C: This has to be a bot. That comment wasn't even coherent.
$C: Just as an FYI, in case you happen to be misinformed:

Net neutrality is the idea that an internet provider, like Comcast, Cox, or Time Warner for example, is not allowed to decide how you use your internet connection. This was put in place by (at the time) FCC chairman Tom Wheeler in response to abuses by Comcast and Time Warner. The rules were due to take effect this year, but were removed by current FCC chairman Ajit Pai before they could. There was an outcry that the FCC ignored public comment (which was in favor of keeping the rules) in doing so, leading to congress using the congressional review act, which is how we got here.

**With** net neutrality, those companies must treat your data with equal priority (speed) regardless of if you’re going to YouTube, Netflix, Amazon, or anywhere else. The current movement is to **put net neutrality back in place**.

**Without** net neutrality, those same companies would be free to give priority service to websites they have agreements with. The concern is that companies could use this to stifle competition - I.E Comcast subscribers can use Comcast’s streaming service for free, or pay extra for Netflix. They have claimed they will not do this, but many are skeptical.
$C: The blue wave that has cost you 41 seats already and is causing record amounts of congressman retirements as the see the writing on the wall?  The blue wave that won us ALABAMA of all places and turned out to be a huge factor in this passing the senate?

That blue wave?
$C: >  Remember how everyone said that shit about Trump never being able to win

some of us call it. because it pretty hard to describe the hitler campaign until it hits people in the face

blue wave is happen whether you like it or not
$C: Yeah you could very confidently remove that /s :p
$C: > The trouble is writing a good op-ed that gets in the paper

Any tips?
$C: I heard it just has to be on topic and mention the reps name.  I don’t know if it’s true but it makes sense to me.  I can’t remember where I saw it.  I just remember it said that rep offices pay more attention to the newspaper when their name was mentioned than any phone call or letter that comes to their office...that doesn’t mean to stop writing to your rep but I would say to submit an op ed to your local paper if theyll run  it.
$C: Op\-eds can be very short \(\~600 words\). A simple letter to the editor can be even shorter.
$C: It's the thing you have to PC load letter
$C: Well letters and other forms of contacting Congressional offices do get tallied up and included in memos on vote recommendations

$C: Trump claimed net neutrality was an Obama conspiracy to censor conservatives. Seriously.

He doesn't want to be educated on a subject he already feels he knows everything about.
$C: Someone other than me please look this up.  It sounds like something I slept through in high school.
$C: Theyre not passing a law. They (congress) are using their "veto" power on an executive agency as has been bestowed on them in a previous law.
$C: Is it even gonna get out of committee in the house? 
$C: Idk I feel like a lot of people are missing the fact that if they vote against it, there’s a pretty big chance they won’t be re-elected. The politicians HAVE to know this and it’s probably making them extremely uneasy. I don’t think it’s a 100% chance that it won’t pass the house, out chances are definitely greater than everyone’s making it out to be.
$C: It won’t get out of committee.

Why would the R’s that control the committee or the Republican House speaker schedule a vote that will result in them looking bad (because they will absolutely vote against it, given the chance)? There’s even [a notorious informal rule against bring bills to a vote that don’t have ‘the support of the majority of the majority’.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hastert_Rule)
$C: But here's the thing... Democrats are backing it, so Trump is going to veto it. He has shown time and time against that he is more about dismantling stuff because Obama or Democrats had a hand in it, instead of actually looking at it in the way of "What's best for the American people?".
$C: What you're saying is that Rupert Murdoch is the President.
$C: Stop it you're embarrassing the trump supporters with how much you're making sense 
$C: Maybe fish prices keep going up because the ocean is outta fish. Give it a break already. 

And China has been engaged in a trade war with us for a long time, we're only just waking up to it. 
$C: Rule 1: There are no rules.
$C: It will pass. They know elections are right around the corner. 
$C: Well I guess after George Washington won the war everyone liked him so he became president.  Usually the system works when we actually get good canadates.
$C: The president is an elected representative of the people, so it's acceptable for him to hold a fair amount of power.  Laws/votes with sufficient support (2/3 of each legislative house) can override the president's veto, which provides another way to balance power.

The "problem" with this vote passing lies in the fact that both houses will be closely divided, which means there is unlikely to be a 2/3 majority to override a veto if it goes to that point.
$C: That's why he won. Because people like you ignore people that voted for him and what we think. 
$C: im not sure, if the house goes for it, i wouldnt be surprised if he changes his mind and signs it, effectively stabbing pai in the back...its not the first time he's thrown someone he's hired in his administration under the bus.
$C: Just a reminded, ajit fuck face was put in by McConnells suggestion to Obama in 2014 or so. As it is tradition the president assigns 3 members and the opposing party's leader suggests 2.

Ajit then was rechosen to be a part of trumps 3 with him as the chairmen.

The point of this distinction is the gop put ajit there. Not trump. 
$C: Spend your time looking at other bills that are pending.

There's really no statement to be made here.
$C: I'd be OK with that and I'd shake his damn hand for it too. Don't really care if he understands the intricacies or not honestly. It's the right choice in every way, shape and form. The same choice I expect my President to make.
$C: He (see: this administration) put the effective tax rates for the rich and super rich down whilst making the poor pay more. That ain't in the spirit of America, and I say that as a non-American.
$C: someone is sucking at the teet of the GOP coolaid. might want to burst that bubble.
$C: They were experts. They weren't letting people touch the tigers, and they had a few, so they were swapping out so they didn't get overwhelmed.
$C: It's red in my mobile app
$C: Get Apollo
$C: Use the reddit is fun app!! It's the only way I browse Reddit. I have seen literally zero change since the redesign. No social media bullshit, I promise :)
$C: Correct, and that is also a problem on the Democratic side.  Hell, that's a problem in any situation!  Not all Repubs are like that though, some of us at least try to be informed!
$C: He said 'influenced'; you're looking to pin all the blame in one place.
$C: >Clinton had a lot of skeletons in the closet


I love how people say this without any clarification.

It is literally the joke from the early season of It’s Always Sunny.

“Name a successful woman politician!”

“Uh, Hillary Rodham Clinton.”

“Awful.”

“What, why?!”

“Hates freedom.”


$C: >Implying Trump doesn't have worse skeletons, and isn't a worse candidate.

Bruh. I would have preferred Bernie too, but using that as an excuse not to vote for Clinton is stupid.
$C: skeletons... Spooky spooky skeletons... What fucking skeletons? The ones that weren't there after repeated republican Investigations? Spooky skeletons indeed.

Fuck, I hate having to reply to bullshit written by someone that knows it's bullshit. I hope the monetary reward you're getting is equal to the amount of time you made other people waste, dude.

$C: >  couldn't beat an orange neanderthal game show

As much as I hate Trump, your comment wins the Internet today!

What's scary to me isn't so much the fact that Drumpf won, but the fact that the said orange Neanderthal game show host 'won' the presidency to one of the leading nations of the world, thanks to the sheer power of stupidity.

It's scary to think that such a large population of stupid people exists amongst us today, in this day  and age of technological advancement and high speed internet connectiviry on almost every phone and computer.

As they say, never attribute to malice that which can be attributed to sheer stupidity.

This was a classic example. 

A sexist, misogynist pig of a man, elected 'President' of a powerful first world nation, by a surprisingly large number of gullible, misinformed 🐑

$C: >Post history is literally nothing but angrily brigading left-wing subs

oh.
$C: Top kek!
$C: The Bill of Rights doesn't apply to private websites idiot. Reddit can ban any user from posting on their site for any reason. They could ban someone if they spelled a word wrong. 
$C: I think you are confusing the ideas that the government cant restrict your ability to speak and a company's ability to prevent fraud amongst those that use its product. Or are you saying that reddit is somehow the government? 

Furthermore, assuming that someone who thinks differently than you must be leftist or a commie or whatever just highlights the inadequacy of your own argument. You have attacked what you have decided their position is (in an unfounded way) instead of what they are actually saying. Look up straw man argument when you get a chance. Logical fallacies in general too - it will help you identify better ways to present your side of a position.
$C: Conservatives two years ago: Free speech! Freedom of association!

Conservatives now: It should be illegal to ban me from twitter.
$C: For instance 
$C: The first amendment has nothing to do with a company providing a platform for Nazis to draw frog cartoons.
$C: Man you trump supporters really are constitutional scholars of the highest order aren’t you?
$C: I'm familiar with how Trump loves to praise the Bill of Rights until someone uses their freedoms to hurt his fee fees
$C: You do understand that private companies are not bound by the rules of free speech... Right... The anti net neutrality crowd is against what Reddit stands for as a company. And they should absolutely shut down obvious troll/shill accounts.
$C: While I don't agree with censorship simply because it disagrees with your opinion, the bill of rights doesn't cover private organizations. Reddit can sensor and promote any ideas they want to. It is important to recognize it is not the left or the right arguing censorship and to understand the difference between how you think things should work and what the actual legal rights are.
$C: That’s true, but a veto override requires a 2/3 vote, and basing on the margin by which this passed the Senate, the chances for a 2/3 vote would be pretty slim to none.
$C: In the history of the US, has there ever been an instance where a veto has been overridden? 
$C: >Should internet service providers be allowed to speed up access to popular websites (that pay higher rates) at the expense of slowing down access to less popular websites (that pay lower rates)?

> Donald Trump’s answer: Yes
$C: Because Pai is his guy.  He set all this in motion to begin without appointing him.  It seems likely to me that ending Net Neutrality is something he wants.
$C: He will if he thinks businessmen won’t rape our pocketbooks but....if it gathers enough support, it will be reintroduced after the grand Cheeto isn’t POTUS anymore and pass...then that dickhead sitting at the head of the FCC won’t be able to do anything about it.  Plus....Elon Musk.  If there’s no net neutrality he’ll eventually kill the telecoms with LEO high speed Internet.  
$C: Having an IQ above room temperature. Not vetoing bills he favors doesn't imply not vetoing bills he doesn't favor.

But he didn't veto this one either, because it predictably didn't pass in the House.
$C: > Protest politics doesn’t work. 

it kinda works if your protest mocks them on a world stage.

Edit: look at all the precious triggered conservatives pretending to be independents responding with "no they totally areeeeee the same hurr durr " at least they aren't stupid enough to try to defend the Republican party, just try to tear the other side down to their level.

"Don't you say bad thing about about our white supremacist. She's clearly the better choice in supremacy." *Vengeful clicking.*  

Best part is the lowest points get great views too. ,,I,, 

$C: I was being sarcastic.

"Both parties are the same" is a technique that has been used (largely by the right, if not exclusively by them) for decades to suppress voter turnout.




$C: The only thing I actually understand about libertarian politics is from a Christian Worker who pretty much described what I would call legalized anarchy. 
$C: Does libertarian mean something different in the states? Here in the UK libertarian just means that you are socially left. It is literally the opposite to authoritarianism.

I consider myself a libertarian because I am an anarcho-communist.
$C: Incorrect. The ISP's  have explicitly been granted monopolies by government intervention. Net Neutrality is an effective method to ensure a competitive information market, which is what libertarians claim to be all about.
$C: Many view the monopolies held by ISPs as government enabled and to ensure fair competition in speeds as means to preserve free market competition in face of government granted Monopoly. I'm not a libertarian although, so would gladly get some more perspectives than what I've seen on their Sub.
$C: I mean, you'd think that libertarians would be for regulation that forced a competitive economic playing field.
$C: Um.. the mythical "free market"?
$C: If competition were reality, they wouldn't.  But it isn't.  The mechanisms by which the industry would reach an efficient and freedom-preserving equilibrium are broken.  They can't be fixed unless you deal with the last mile problem.

So...  The options at the moment are (in most areas) regulated and protected monopoly ISPs that aren't allowed to be too shitty in certain ways, or monopoly ISPs that can be as shitty as they want.  

It would be a purely pragmatic vote, not an ideological one.
$C: In what world do you live in that a free and open internet is not a libertarian supported policy?
$C: If people would stop just assuming this was the case, then it would eventually actually stop being the case.  Might take a while, but doing otherwise is just a self fulfilling prophecy.
$C: And when he turns around and does the opposite, they turn a blind eye because of the magic R
$C: Republicans are consistently worse. Democrats don't have to be perfect to be markedly better. 
$C: The Democratic party is becoming the party of the corporate establishment. Nowhere to turn, might be time to trash it all and start over.
$C: >It’s telling that there aren’t any nays with “Democrat” after their name...


FTFYB
$C: Right, because saying "*againsts*" is completely impossible so we should never need to write it down.
$C: I could see a case made for *against*s. When referring to a word rather than the thing it describes, italics are used. (There are three consecutive sets of double letters in *bookkeeper*. My bookkeeper was unimpressed when I told her that fact.) I feel like I could argue the same basic principle applies here.
$C: Too bad more americans don't get this.
$C: Im not saying Im against NN, but this is false. Conservatives and Republicans are against excessive regulation. 
$C: The vast majority yes.  Silicon Valley corporations are huge Democratic supporters, so that shouldn't be a shock.  Getting the Blue Dogs in line is another matter.  They were very slow to get on board.
$C: It’s an observation. I explained what’s going on. You used the word stupid. If anything it would be “ignorant”. Not stupid. Very different things. I also added that after being downvoted into oblivion with no reasoning. So it’s a very apt observation and not the reason nobody properly responded. 

Speaking of ignorant. I’ve posted plenty of information for my point to stand. The only thing anyone else has posted is basically “nuh uh”. And that was “rewarded” so there’s that. 

Votes use is to sort most relevant to least. Stuff on the bottom then gets filtered, requiring extra work to see. This is a form of self censorship in the way it’s used. Being, you don’t like something, so you make it “go away” from sight. It’s the motive. And the motive is clear. Don’t let anyone else see this easily. When the motive is for the default filter to make the very relevant stuff you don’t like to go away, that’s censorship. You don’t like that word, but that’s what it is. The fact you see it’s primary use to “filter” is pretty telling. 0-2

But please, what I really want to know is if this round of NN has the same pitfalls as before that allow the Feds to leverage ISPs to do their bidding.  I’ve linked and pasted more than enough below to make this point. Almost too much. Maybe you couldn’t find it since it was “filtered”. 
$C: First, read: https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2017/05/18/the_ugly_truth_about_obamas_net_neutrality_110247.html

Ignore any opinion. Read the facts part about how it worked. 

Now also read this other tidbit of law passed on a Christmas-time vote hidden in a fed budget vote. 

(Digging for other link to the law signed in. I doubt anyone will actually read the law link so I’m looking for the synopsis)
Actual bill:
http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20161128/CRPT-114HRPT-S2943.pdf



Section passed:

https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2692/text

This establishes a “Center” as the white house, appointed by the white house, and controlled from within the white house with little to no oversight. This center grants fed to control the title ii license that Net netrality requires broadband providers to hold to operate and suspend if they dont comply. Will they? Who knows but this makes it legal and explains what they can and will do in detail. What’s not detailed is the definitions of what they deem an issue. Regardless, no one should have that power. 



——copy pasta——
The file is titled National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017,
"He waited until Christmas Eve and hid it inside of the 3,000 page annual military budget so nobody would notice it."
"Ohhhh shit yeah this is that fuckin propaganda thing that Obama legalized"
"So you've already read through it?"
"Jesus Christ." The lawyer flips through the 3,076 pages of the NDAA to page 1,396 (or 1,438 in pdf format).
SEC. 1287. GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT CENTER.
"This is so much more than just propaganda. Look at the original draft of the legislation."
>Identifying current and emerging trends in foreign propaganda and disinformation, including the use of print, broadcast, online and social media, support for third-party outlets such as think tanks, political parties, and nongovernmental organizations, and the use of covert or clandestine special operators and agents to influence targeted populations and governments in order to coordinate and shape the development of tactics, techniques, and procedures to expose and refute foreign misinformation and disinformation


>The legislation establishes a fund to help train local journalists...


>Second, the legislation seeks to leverage expertise from outside government... provide grants and contracts to NGOs, civil society organizations, think tanks, private sector companies, media organizations, and other experts outside the U.S. government...

"They call in their globalist friends from some "totally neutral third-party" and together they can call anyone a propagandist. They can go after literally anybody who's been flagged by a third-party "fact-checker" without having to take them to court. "
"Oh fuck”

"It's brilliant, really. They control the fact-checkers, the enforcers, and with the passage of Title II, the infrastructure to utilize them. Once a propagandist has been targeted, the President can use absolutely anything in the government to stop them."

>The Center will develop, integrate, and synchronize whole-of-government initiatives to expose and counter foreign disinformation operations...

And that's it ladies and gentlemen.
That's why passing Net Neutrality is so important.
The President uses the "whole-of-government" to suppress information. Thanks to Net Neutrality's Title II, they can order all ISPs to take down hostile information and any websites that distribute it. If the ISP refuses, their Title II Broadcasting License is legally revoked, they can no longer do business, they go bankrupt, and the government inherits their infrastructure. The government can integrate into the ISPs to censor anything, anywhere, at anytime. The ISPs are forced to obey.

STORY TIME IS OVER THIS IS ACTUALLY REAL

Are you imagining how real this is?
They can physically shut down your access to the internet without a court order! Just because someone called you a propagandist! Just because you shitpost. They can take down Fox News, Drudge Report, Breitbart, 4chan, Voat, and any other website that pops up to replace it! They would have done this slowly, over the course of years, like they always do, so that nobody would notice until it's too late! They could've taken us down one buy one, year by year, and quietly suppress any online reactions!
And it was 100% legal! They passed every law they needed to do it! Will they? Who knows  but, it was legal  and passed as law  

AND NOW ONE FINAL QUOTE:

>p.1446 - "The Center shall terminate on the date that is 8 years after the date of the enactment of this Act."

They thought she would win.


And let’s not forget how much soros and other backed this. And how unnecessary it was. And how it never covered mobile broadband, which only got better and cheaper over time it was never under NN. 


$C: Sorry, the part I was bringing up on the competition front is because of the Time Warner/Comcast where they refused to compete with each other then look up and said "Hey, can we have a merger please! Look, it's not a monopoly, we aren't even competing with each other!"

And yea, I would probably actually agree with Republicans if there was more competition because I do live in an area with Google Fiber. The main reason the other two continue to exist is Google Fiber can't set up homes fast enough (still growing in the Kansas City region) but the second you get out of greater city region, you've lost the competitors and get stuck with two that "Compete" and any rural your only option is to go without net or lube up and take it.
$C: Yeah exactly. It’s the same reason they fight against Google Fiber being put country wide. 

How the hell is google fiber not in New York City yet?? I don’t know anyone that wouldn’t immediately switch over from the shitty spectrum/twc/fios/ whatever the hell they keep changing their names too so we don’t realise they’re the same company. 
$C: they are not oligopolies in all areas. in some they are full blown monopoly where you have zero internet choice, outide of tethering a cellphone or something. 

In the city here I live they split up the city into zones where only one cable choice is available, and the non-cable options are dogshit
$C: First we need to eliminate any regulations that prevents businesses from competing, then we can take a look at net neutrality in a few years. Can't put the cart before the horse
$C: "Dear Republicans,

I know micro means small, but micromanagement of all the citizens does not mean small government."
$C: Some is government intervention, usually in big cities where one corporation pays to lock it down. 

But a lot, especially in rural and suburban communities is only larger corporations can pull off starting up and mobilizing out into the rural pockets. They specifically work at not competing with each other because simply put, that's putting money into places where people have a choice where they can keep putting money where they have a captive audience. As I reference the Time Warner and Comcast merger option, this was SPECIFICALLY the argument they made to the government why they should merge, because they weren't competing.

But lets go to big cities even. Google Fiber, while makes for fantastic in my region, failed to fully launch nationally. It's expensive as fuck that one of the top companies in the country can't even break into the market. Why is that? Because the cable companies own the cable running the cities. To get that "last mile" you hear a lot about, the new one coming in has to put down the lines to enter an area. Now unbundling would be a regulation as well.

What would local loop unbundling look like? Remember the days of 56k modems. You had your ISP that you paid for. But that funny thing is visiting a relative who didn't have internet and had a completely different phone company than you, you could still pull a laptop out and with a modem access the internet (something I did visiting family.) Telecommunications Act of 1996 is what made regional telephone providers play nice with each other. Remember how there was a shitload of 56k isps? All the AOL disks?

But in the age of broadband, cable companies are under no such directive (Supreme Court Decision in 05) so a new company rolls in starts trying to dig ground in to put up new cables and AT&T/Comcast/Verizon/COX just slashes their prices where the new company can't possibly make a profit, new company dies and the original ISP just jacks the prices up again and calls it a day. This is why in Kansas City you'd be amazed at how cheap Comcast is compared to when I lived in Little Rock, they're just competing against Google who can keep it running for a city.
$C: The infrastructure was paid for in part with public funds.  The tax payers told them to build fiber and wrote them a check.  They took the money and ran.
$C: Yeah everyone who disagrees with you is a shill
$C: Calm down. At no point did I say that. 
$C: I tried googling how many democrats voted to ban guns, but there are no results matching your claim whatsoever. How odd that there's no factual evidence behind your single issue voter claim.

Joking of course... there's nothing odd about a lie lacking factual evidence. 😉
$C: And it's how we feel about republicans who vote to NOT take your guns away.
$C: Which makes it sound like that is somehow an excuse or rationalization. "I voted against my constituents because the rest of my party hates your freedom, not because *I* hate your freedom! No harm no foul right guys?" 

Voting the party line is a choice. They made the choice to vote against their constituents. Period
$C: [deleted]
$C: Yeah, this is pretty accurate. 
$C: You're saying the exact same thing as the comment you are replying to.
$C: Amen. On so many levels.
$C: Agreed. That guy has villain face. Could easily get the role of any bad guy in a movie.
$C: It's gonna be a looooooooong time before he's gone.
$C: Say that twice. 
$C: So those morons at the trailer park that say fuck every other word are geniuses right?
$C: Wait so they think being rude makes them look smarter?
$C: 🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓
$C: You should probably be aware that the post above was cherry-picked deliberately to give that impression. Check out the [full voting record](https://votesmart.org/bills/NA/2018/) - a general problem with US politics is both parties opposing legislation just because it was put forward by the other side. You can find plenty of examples of what look like "evil" votes by the Democrats since many representatives care more about point-scoring than serving the public interest. Meanwhile users like the OP above selectively present the issue to push their desired political agenda, even though if exactly the same legislation were proposed by the other party the votes would totally flip.

In essence you're looking at propaganda, and it's working.
$C: You don't, you remove it's right to vote based on sanity.

Buying votes and manipulating idiots: great!

Not letting people who don't understand vote: muh freedom!
$C: They think abortion is actual murder. That's a silly viewpoint, but if you thought it youd be passionate. The problem is that in most cases the candidates are selected on issues like this, where that person will have literally zero chance of affecting that issue, and their viewpoints on the ones they could affect are happily ignored. 

It's akin to choosing a toddler to do brain surgery on you because the only doctor around beats his wife. Not the path I'd choose, regardless of how deplorable the moral fiber is.

$C: I'm from a portion of New York that has huge Trump support and none of these guys are religious at all. 
$C: That's called religious fanaticism. The same kind of thing he, I'm sure, accuses those of other Faith's of being guilty.
$C: Hope he dies of a heart attack? 
$C: >The news says Sean Hannity loves America and Obama is a coon who should "go back to Africa".  I'm voting Trump!   Rah rah!! Dems gunna take muh guns.  REEEE!!!!!

Like that, eh?
$C: Republicans believe in less regulation, less government intervention and more freedom. Just like the for fathers who created the constitution.

They will vote against most things that increase spending or increase regulation.

The Democratic Party is often the opposite. They want regulation and government intervention. The dream is the “Nanny state”. A massive safe space where there is no harm or challenge. The only challenge is getting over your own feelings of worthless because everything is so easy.

They will vote for most things that increase regulation and spending, unless it is not politically correct.

Trump is more of an independent with a republican lean. 

By the looks of those votes, the Republican Party is somewhat more divided than the Democratic Party.
$C: Unfortunately, the whole electoral system and campaign finance system need to be gutted and reassembled non-stupidly.  That would require politicians to vote against their funders and probably never get elected again.  They will never do that.
$C: Abortion and guns.  They really don't care for anything else, or anyone else.
$C: It's pretty clear that republicans are almost unanimous on saying fuck you to people's rights to Internet, health care, working conditions, fair wages, free speech, environment, education... and on and on.  Basically anything good, republicans vote against and anything bad they vote for.  If you happen to dig long enough and find something to the contrary, THAT would be cherry picking.
$C: > It's more like how the Republicans don't have any common sense.


FIFY

$C: Republicans:  We pretend to care up until you're born... then fuck you and your mother too.

is how it looks to me
$C: Wow, what a bold assumption. I never said I didn't believe it, just pointing out that it is a copy pasta, which is another fact. I am amazed how fast you went to personal insults to defend your views, good job making yourself look bad.
$C: It is grossly misleading, mind you. The list above is cherry-picked to paint one party as villainous whereas what you really see is both parties voting against all legislation from their opposition even when it seems absurd.
$C: Because it is very lazy way to fling mud at your opposition. Good job on the original creator for actually doing the research to compile that list, but the amount of Redditors who literally copy and paste it and go "well, where is YOUR research?" is pretty annoying.
$C: Beto's my boy. That being said, I would've voted for a flaming pile of dog shit over Cruz.
$C: Beto immediately shot himself in the foot not long after having a good chance because of his talks of banning "assault style rifles" which are already banned. Real shame, he seemed nice.
$C: It used to be that the rubes who believe AM Radio and FOX News were the pawns that politicians bilked to get their way. We've reached the point now where the people running believe the con and they're all in. They are just that stupid now.
$C: At least you're making an effort.  Thanks!
$C: I was very surprised that Kennedy swapped and changed his vote. Very proud of him for that, as I was born there and lived there until about 3 years ago. I still follow their politics and I think it was great of him. But I still can’t discount his other policies and practices. 
$C: Only after doing a bunch of meth, probably.
$C: You're going to vote on him as a thank you? What the fuck. Don't do that. Vote on him if you agree with his policies... 
$C: Why doesn't she change sides then?
$C: Since Trump was elected, [Collins votes party-line 80% of the time](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/?ex_cid=rrpromo).  Most of these votes are probably confirmations for administration officials and judges.
$C: Ah yes, Louisiana and Alaska, famously swingy states.
$C: They still broke party lines. I'd never vote for them even if I was American, but breaking party lines when the rest of the party has been bought out is commendable.
$C: Murkowski and Collins both voted against DeVos IIRC
$C: Breaking party lines, especially on such a major issue like this, is not common, and it's commendable that they did the right thing. Get your head out of your ass.
$C: Nigga what a fool. Democrats are bought and paid for by insurance, big pharma, weapons manufacturers, themselves gun running, unions, big banky mcbanks, etc etc 

When you vote it’s like internet without net neutrality. Do you want the corrupt corporation vote package A, or the corrupt corporation vote package B. And people justify it cuz they prefer one set of corporations to the other. Or because one is more palatable cuz muh minorities 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Eh, I mean sure, fuck that guy, but he's really not wrong in general. It would be dangerous to assume otherwise.  Democrats are just as dependent on "campaign contributions"
$C: Beep boop ooga booga 
$C: *cognitive dissonance*
$C: Disregard my comment then.
$C: Again, majority=/=all. Generalizing is the biggest ignorance you can do.
$C: Naw there's a load of things I like about the Democrat policy. I just can't stand for a lot of the non-nonsensical bullshit that often accompanies it. I align libertarian if anything. 

I really don't like how a lot of Democrats try to micromanage the people, restrict what individuals can and can't do. I've seen how my state is run under this ideology. And I really can't stand it. 
$C: Good bot
$C: Literally any vote regarding gun control. 

I'm not a fan of the Republican party, but IMO, they're generally on the right side of that fight, regardless of their motivations. 

The closest thing I consider myself to be is a Classic Liberal, and as such don't identify strongly with Ds or Rs. I believe in the individual liberties of the people, including the ones that are politically unpopular. This generally means I'm "pro-choice" on almost all topics, but I'll give anything that doesn't directly infringe on those rights a fair shake. 

More importantly, I am absolutely certain that if Dems backed off on the  gun control attempts, you'd see a lot of otherwise R voters flocking to their side in a lot of elections. It's a stumbling block for them.
$C: My previous comment should be read in its entirety. I dont believe that party members on either side are representing their base or their views. They are both highly self interested entities competing for votes to further secure their access to power. I said both sides are flawed, and instead chose to focus on the core beliefs and philosophies that dominate each party respectively. The voters for each party operate more on pure political philosophy as opposed to a party that uses the philosophies as very basic guidelines and then proceeds to act in its own interest. My main focus was on the political mindsets of the voters for each of the parties compared to the actual execution of these political philosophies by the elected representatives themselves. 
$C: Out of curiosity which 2 are you thinking of? 

I am curious which ones stand out to you as fitting more into those 3 than any other "red states". I can't claim to be familiar with all of them, but 2 seems like a pretty low estimate...
$C: As someone from outside the US, could you please name them me?
$C: When your third quality of life argument is related to owning guns, I can see the lower education already. 
$C: My state (NC) ranks [25th in federal aid as percentage of state revenue](https://taxfoundation.org/states-rely-most-federal-aid/). That’s lower than blue states OR, ME, RI, and just one rank above NY.

We also have some of the best private and public universities in the country, including Duke, UNC, and Wake Forest.

We’re not perfect by any means, and we have a long way to go. But there is a reason New Englanders and West Coasters are flocking here in droves.
$C: I’m not on welfare, thanks. 
$C: Well blue states make more money so that makes sense. As much as the media and crazy people want to split this country into blue and red. We are all still Americans that should work together.
$C: A pension? Sorry I’m from Massachusetts where that word no longer exists
$C: [deleted]
$C: Unfortunately it's because partisan politics are the name of the game nowadays. I agree, he's welcome to his opinion and I agree a lot of Democrats blind themselves to the bad that happens in the party and forget you can like some parts and be angry with others. But this is as big with Republicans (see Obamacare vs Affordable Care Act) to where very few in the nation are actually talking anymore vs "My party."

Now that said... 
>I don't know why this is downvoted.

Come on, he knew exactly the way the thread was going. I for one am not downvoting him because you're right, it's an opinion. But there's DEFINITELY a difference between right/wrong and surprise.  It'd be like me going onto T_D and posting the against list and "We should vote these guys out!" and turn around going "I don't know why I was downvoted."
$C: I’ve lived in both and it seems to me Red states just leave you alone to your business. That’s all I really want 
$C: Reddit is never going to be a place where dissenting opinions are gracefully received. The downvote button is just too easy to press.

But I will point out that his comment was a throw away. What does he mean by worse? It's so open to interpretation that it'd be hard to take positively or respond to meaningfully.
$C: >With net neutrality, ISP's aren't able to discriminate whether you like using Google or Bing, Netflix or Hulu, Spotify or Apple Music and therefore aren't able to further monetize a system that they have already monopolized.

You've got a pretty good handle on it. And here's where the "anti-competition" argument of the Republicans fall flat. Netflix/Amazon/YouTube/Hulu are okay with Net Neutrality falling. They've got enough money to pay their fees to ISPs but any new streaming service trying to compete with them would now have to be paying the ISPs, which means it'd kill startups.

Also, here's the scary one. 
>Update: We won the Net Neutrality vote in the Senate!

on the front page of Reddit. With Net Neutrality an ISP is forced to treat anything coming through as the same. But without, they can pick and choose what sites to throttle. News sites that disagree with them, Social media sites, etc the ISP has an opportunity to decide what you see.

Now would they take that option? Surely not. We can trust them... right? guys?
$C: > Why hasn’t he just resigned yet?

He's 15 months into a 6 year term. When he leaves, the Republican Governor will appoint a Republican interim replacement until a Special Election can be held. If McCain leaves before May 30th, that Special Election will be held November 2018. If he leaves after May 30th, it'll be held in 2020. Democrats have a lot of momentum currently and would have a great shot at taking the seat (and holding it until 2022) if the election is this year. It would greatly increase the likelihood that Democrats could take back the House and the Senate in these midterms. So, it's not an egotistical move, but rather, what's best for his party.
$C: Even if he did resign, there wouldn't have been a replacement in time for this vote because they need to hold another election
$C: I mean, the people did vote him in as their senator until that specific term ended. I'm not very politically savvy, so I don't know how his replacement would be chosen, but the only way for it to be equally as democratic is for another election. Might as well let him be, ya know? 
$C: I think his reasoning has to do with benefits for his family. Idk, honestly. 
$C: I couldn't remember if it was brain cancer or a brain tumor. What a terrible way to go.
$C: For real. Every politician probably has a big moment type vote or action they've taken or abstained from taking. OP followed the healthcare plan closely, but with the 80 billion other things our Congress has been indecisive about, it's a bit unfair to blow a gasket at the simple question. 

On the one hand, people freak the fuck out if you aren't involved in politics. Maybe this guy never has been, but one things for sure: if he asks a simple question of "why didn't this politician vote" and receives the response of "UH HE'S AN INTEGRAL PART OF STOPPING A BILL THAT I PERSONALLY DIDN'T LIKE"... you can bet he isn't super excited about asking politically curious questions in the future.
$C: Hey, TheDragonLake, just a quick heads-up: 
*aint* is actually spelled *isn't*. You can remember it by *using your memory.*
Have a nice day!
$C: Oh dude, you want to feel good about your state look up Eric Greitens. Our only hope is that it's actually looking more and more likely he's going to be impeached. House of Cards wished they came up with some of this crap.
$C: Haaaaaaaaaahhhh.... right. Two senators per state. I knew that. I should have picked up on it because I was discussing it when it came up about Boozman and Cotton.

Now if you'll excuse me I'm gonna stick my head between a door and close it a couple times for derping like that.
$C: Listening to the debate about net neutrality on *intellegence squared* was pretty frustrating because of this. The moderator  (typically wondeful) didn't fully understand the topic and as a result had some short comings when leading the discussion. But what was a real bummer was that the side arguing against kept saying that doctors and gamers would have to use the same quality connection. That's completely inaccurate. The team arguing against net neutrality ended up winning the debate by, in my mind, was just because of miss information.
$C: This. Because when the first they heard of this issue, it was probably framed as “the government is over-regulating the Internet, which is hurting businesses”, which I think depicts how easily they all could have defaulted to their own party line without thinking twice about it. I think once they more thoughtfully consider the ramifications of repealing net neutrality a little more, recognizing the danger is inevitable (if they have a soul, that is).
$C: That's ironic...  
  
> Net neutrality enjoys bipartisan support among voters according to a survey conducted by Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland last December. That survey found that after the issue was explained to them, 83 percent of respondents, including 89 percent of Democrats and 75 percent of Republicans, favored keeping the Obama-era rules.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Regardless, it had nothing to do with senate voting.
$C: So I have been informed. I've edited my comment.
$C: The last time I posted in /r/conservative I got banned.  They said it was because "you are not a conservative" (actual quote) even though there are no rules about that.

IMO the real reason is that I got into a debate in a previous article with one of the mods.  Since he was obviously being an idiot and wrong he couldn't do anything about it, so he just waited until I made a post that he could possibly justify something with.

I was in there trying to see if there was value to their points of view.  So when I saw an article, I was generally diving into it looking to see if the article was based on good or bad data.  Generally bad.  Most times when I looked at poll data that an article quoted, it didn't actually back up what the article claimed.  Once, there was an article that took a shitty situation that could be described as "judge seals terrible rape case involving minors, minors accepted a plea deal that involved no jail time, sentencing goes pretty much as expected, nobody happy with the no-win situation" and presents it as "liberal judge lets three grown men get away with raping a 5 year old girl! No jail time!"

So yeah.  Not a great sub IMO.
$C: Yeah, but I was surprised, because during the republican primaries it was super anti-trump.
$C: "Everyone with a different opinion to me is racist."
$C: Lol off by a metric mile
$C: Collusion. 
$C: They literally used a racial slur. 
$C: The fact she’s important to you says a lot about your priorities 
$C: I don't know of any unbiased national news organizations. Care to name one?
$C: Unfortunately The internet is ruining news as we know it. More and more people are getting their information from online sources for free, where the most eye catching and wild stories get the views. 

Television is failing, the more reasons a station can give you to watch them the better, real journalism is few and far between, and ethics take a back seat to $ almost by necessity these days.
$C: "Accurately" 

I didn't come here to laugh. Before I expend any effort on your response, how would you reply to a *very* long list of retracted articles, false reports, and egregiously opinionated punditry?

I can't believe there are still functioning adults who will defend CNN and Huffpo. You'd think after 18 months of doleing out endorphins for the left's deficit, a good sum of you would go, eh, maybe they are pandering to us, knowing we'll just eat the shit up?


Fuck it, you seem to really want a list like this copy pasta doesn't exist...

$C: /r/NeutralPolitics 

/r/AskTrumpSupporters 


$C: There's plenty of places you can talk to Trump supporters.

Don't generalize an entire political belief, there's only 2 parties in America, that's a lot of people.
$C: Don't call me by my government name. 
$C: Aww thanks sweety,  I'm gonna guess you're a hooker then? Xoxo 

Something, something, book covers
$C: You sound like an angry person. 
$C: https://i.imgur.com/XjJ46VH.png
$C: Share the top arguments both for and against it. 
$C: Well, you make people read the bill, then have them ask questions to two representative of both sides, one pro, one against, after the representative raise a couple of points of concern from their sides.
$C: It’s really hard be objective and keep things in layman’s terms,

That’s why it’s problematic either way 
$C: That literally is why the term was invented, for exactly that kind of scenario.
$C: Exactly, thanks! Every media outlet needs to have a spin or they won’t sell. Is it their fault or ours? Chicken or the egg? 
$C: But if I just pick a team, then I won't have to think.
$C: Yeah, one regulated and one laissez faire. I believe the former worked before when big players were gaining a foothold in terms of network coverage. But now there are the money isn’t there anymore to start one’s own ISP (unless there was some other revolutionary innovation). 

I guess my big question is, if the repealing Net Neutrality opens up for competition, who does it open competition for? 
a) Big ISPs to compete against one another
b) New ISPs to join

The current landscape that I see makes b not feasible, but I’m totally open to hearing ideas of how we can make it possible.
$C: Jeeze, maybe that story isn’t anecdotal just to you. I’ve a similar vein in my own family (one sides strongly Dem and another strongly Rep). And it all goes way back, and definitely for other people as well.

It seems like tradition towers over a lot of reasoning in these debates. I have a hard time because I get into arguments with both sides, just when I call into question something I don’t know if I agree with. Then they act like I’m picking sides and betrayed them, when really I’m just trying to ask if we are voting a certain way based off our own reasoning or just some “that’s how it’s always been” kind of thing. And then same thing happens on the other side, so here I am left on the border line trying keep them from killing each other (figuratively).

Edit: Thanks for sharing!
$C: I feel like the term Net Neutrality also sounds so vague. Might as well be a term at Bass Pro Shop when you are indifferent about what net to buy.

FCC’s repeal is called the Internet Freedom, maybe if NN would have been labeled like that it could have garnered more support. “You want to preserve Internet Freedom” sounds better than “You want to preserver NET NEUTRALITY”

Granted, neither really are descriptive
$C: Well somebody's not going to get any more telecom dollars.
$C: Touché
$C: Aren't you doing exactly that when you frame Republicans that way? How much of your information was from actual politicians?
$C: Its sad how biased the media (left and right learning) has become despite so many people agreeing that it is biased.
$C: You have no proof of that. Show me the survey before they "explained it"
$C: I agree that the NN issue is a symptom of a larger problem, but I don't see why it's necessary to kill it just to drum up public opposition. No amount of negative PR will fix the situation. People can't even boycott them because in most areas they only have one ISP. How does allowing them to abuse power fix anything? If anything, wouldn't it allow for them to lock down competition even more?
$C: > watch Comcast and their ilk start abusing customers, and get people upset enough to effect real change   
  
Except Comcast is already abusing customers, people are already upset, and nothing is happening.
$C: I don't think that's what would happen, though. These companies already treat their customers poorly enough to justify kicking up a fuss. Maybe if they were enabled to walk over their customers a little more, people would demand change... or maybe that would just become the new normal. Intentionally making things worse in the hopes that change will follow seems like an awfully big risk.
$C: This.
$C: Sad, but true.  Most people need to experience hardship before they can understand it,  in my observations.  
$C: Thanks for letting me know about your edit! I think you may have misunderstood, I'm not an expert either but I'm pretty sure I've got a good handle.

Anyway net neutrality doesn't make people pay more at all, and is better for everyone no matter how much you are using. 

So your subriber only charges you for your internet service and depending on how much bandwidth you need, you pay more, or less. If I only need a ten megabit connection, it's gonna cost less then 150 megabit.

If you're only using it for basic email 10 megabit is more than enough. However with net neutrality gone, it makes it more complicated.

Say you prefer Gmail, as it suits your buisness better than say Hotmail, with net neutrality your provider can't say "well you can only use Gmail if you pay an extra 25$ a month, but hotmail is free, you can always switch." 

Or the provider can extort money out of Google. Google has to now pay providers in order for Googles consumer to use their service, as a result, you may now have to pay Google for using Gmail. 

The repeal of Net neutrality not only hurts consumers, but also hurts businesses, especially new ones, because of this paywall. 

Say you want to start a new business. It doesn't really matter what. If you want to advertise or sell online, you may get stuck, as internet providers are blocking your website in favor of a bigger business who has money to pay them. 

Net neutrality ensures a open market for the internet, and protects you, I, and the mom and pop store down the road who uses a website. It protects anyone who has a preference to what service they use. 

If anyone else would like to clarify or correct something I was wrong on feel free! 
$C: I’m afraid you do still misunderstand it. To simplify it as much as possible, the problem is that without net neutrality isp’s can prioritize what you do with your internet access.

Right now whatever you pay for your internet you can go to any site you choose. Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, twitch, poor hub, wikia, whatever. You paid for the data. You use it as you wish. 

Without net neutrality isp’s will have the freedom to sell you the exact same plan, but also prioritize sites they have agreements or deals with for “fast lanes.” You can go to Facebook at full speed but they may throttle twitch if you don’t have some hypothetical gamer plan. Perhaps they’ll throttle your naughty sites if you don’t pay an extra fee. They’ll call them fast lanes but at the speed the internet tends to be anyway, it would just effectively slow down their competitors. It would leave you unable to neutrally access any site for your money. Hence “net neutrality.”

Edit: another thing, maybe you’ve noticed a lot of isp’s, particularly Comcast, adding competing streaming services. They’ll offer theirs at full speed but throttle the likes of Netflix. 
$C: There's no rule that says you can only focus on one thing at a time, and it's a hell of a long-term process to unwind a monopoly.

In the meantime, surely focusing on mitigating the negative effects of the monopoly is worth doing too.
$C: no one can research net neutrality and then go from liking it to disliking it. this post isn't free speech, it's russian bot troll collusion
$C: Still against reddiquette to downvote an opinion you don't like, which is what this commenter is indicating. 
$C: Propagandized according to whom?
$C: Whew, that b8 stinks m8
$C: I don't try to discredit peoples opinions like that. I agree that it happens on both sides, but assuming that I do it too is wrong. The issue is when you try and discredit the other side entirely with unsubstantiated claims. I do agree that assuming that of Republicans is wrong, but assuming that I do that is also wrong.
$C: You just answered with another unsubstantiated claim. Calling people with opposing ideas "liars" as a whole isn't an actual argument, you're just trying to discredit their ideas.
$C: Kudos to you for circulating this info. Maybe it'll promote more discussion instead of just shouting matches like I've seen in most of this thread.
$C: So no, then.
$C: Naw that's an acceptable way of looking at things. I personally don't agree, but whatever. Are you trying to win a conversation?

$C: And only Congress can save us now?
$C: I'm always left wondering what's up with McCain politically. He seems like one of the more principled Republicans yet he frequently votes against the party trends. Why not just go full independent? Surely he's significant enough that he could win elections on name alone. 
$C: RIP McCain. :(
$C: I wouldn't doubt it for a second, corruption and ignorance have become synonymous with Republican
$C: Yes, that's why you recruit the right people to a cause.  Get people who've shown they'll stick to their own guns instead of riding in the pockets of lobbyists.
$C: But why not both?  Why not keep Net Neutrality laws in place and also break up the monopolies?  
$C: Congress isn’t voting this in, trump isn’t signing it, game over 
$C: > Net Neutrality is a fairly popular issue

Hahaha. You really think Trump supporters will change their vote based on something that they've been told is socialist commie propaganda?
$C: Congress isn’t passing it, President ain’t signing it, I consider that a game over 
$C: But you still lost. This is sad and pathetic 

Edit: Keep em coming crybabies, so far I got 2 Russian bot accusations and multiple corporate shill accusations
$C: Replying to you and /u/NADER_THE_GATOR because I'm surprised no one else has. I don't have a full understanding of this all, but because this isn't a bill but a check that congress has on the executive branch (which includes the fcc), they only need a simple majority rather than 2/3. That's my understanding anyway. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
$C: Yea, it’s kinda funny how much in denial everyone is.
$C: Dude thank you so much.  I hate when people just downvote posts cause they don't agree and fail to provide a valid reason why.  Thank you for providing your imput even though it gets downvoted.
$C: Why
$C: This is why aliens don't visit us
$C: There may not be an outright monopoly in ISPs, but it's down to 2 or 3 in a lot of places, with a HUGE gap in performance when it comes to the company in the number 1 slot \(so still basically a monopoly\).

If you want decent service \(as in not dial\-up, satellite internet, or some other weird or slow option\), there's usually only one decent option.
$C: Well duopoly, or triopoly then
$C: There are plenty of relatively populous areas where a single ISP has a monopoly. I have known many family members who live not in a major city to only have 1 broadband option.

Heck, when I was in college, Comcast was the only option. We had nothing else available. Couldn't even install satellite if you were in a dorm (and wouldn't if you were out of the dorms because 5 down is not enough to upload a document without being disconnected).
$C: Hi, I live in Baltimore. Comcast has a monopoly. Now you're educated.
$C: I did. You missed it. 
$C: Read his first sentence again.  He answered your question.
$C: The DACA thing? Where he started changing his "view" so much in one day the republicans had to remind him? That comes to mind pretty quick.

Disagreeing with you is not censorship.

You know what *is* censorship? [Threatening to get people deported because you didn't like some words they said.](https://www.rawstory.com/2018/05/white-man-freaks-hearing-spanish-spoken-nyc-threatens-call-ice-hes-laughed-coffee-shop/)

I'm tired of this Orwellian bullshit coming from the right.
$C: You confusing criticism and disagreement with censorship. 

Actual proposed policy prescriptions related to the first Ammendment, like making it easier for politicians to sue reporters, for some reason don't matter to you.
$C:  So what you're saying is they aren't the same, and one is objectively the better choice. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: I don't know if you can veto an FCC regulation
$C: ...welp. that's gonna suck. Hopefully he doesn't
$C: So this is an empty victory ... because it’s guaranteed he will veto it. 
$C: Lol why in the world are you paying hundreds of dollars a month on internet? And I’m not pretending anything. You clearly are extremely gullible to fall for such a bullshit idiotic excuse made up by service providers. Keeping them from censoring and altering internet traffic has absolutely no effect on prices. 
$C: I feel like they only care about that in the month or two before re-election.
$C: No it won’t, there is no one who is a single issue voter on net neutrality, that’s just the reality of it.

If Trump wanted to sign net neutrality and was running vs a democrat who was against it you think anyone on this site who hates Trump is going to switch their vote? 
$C: NN < abortion is what it comes down to. Many republican voters would not favor a pro-choice candidate just to restore NN
$C: r/murderedbywords
$C: This guy knows what’s up.
$C: There was no argument for how he was wrong in that comment. NN regulation is very recent, that’s a fact, I think we can agree. The internet did function before that, and does function in countries that don’t have NN regulation. 
$C: Downvotes are irrelevant to me. 

I was on Reddit before what is being repealed was enacted. Funny enough there was more diverse content back then and less political spam across subreddits. 

People sorely have no clue about this issue other puff pieces that repeat the half baked crap over and over.  
$C: What the fuck America. How does your "democracy" allow for bills to be rejected even when a majority of people and a majority of a House want it 
$C: Fitting that such a shitty rule is named after such a shitty person. 
$C: The Speaker schedules floor votes for bills. If he doesn't schedule it, there's no vote.

Now, there is such a thing as a "discharge petition" which certain members [are presently trying to use](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/9/17335640/immigration-congress-daca-law-news) to force a DACA vote; but this is incredibly rare. 
$C: He's the speaker of the house, he can essentially unilaterally decide things don't go to the floor.  The speaker of the house is very powerful.

That said, it's powerful and he can be removed very quickly if republicans want to do so, the fact is they won't remove him over this.  There's only one option to get the house to behave in favor of this, that's to vote republicans out of office, so they select a speaker who would let this bill come to a vote.
$C: I hate every position paul ryan holds as much as the next guy, but how could he not?  He was voted into his position by other members of the house, and since the republicans are the majority they picked one of theirs.
$C: He doesn’t “control votes”, but there are processes he can use to keep bills from being voted on. Both parties do it, so it’s not just Ryan. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: AMERICA! 

FUCK NO! 
$C: It will never be about doing what's right until we can take money out of elections.  Until then, we're stuck with the shitty system we have.  Second most powerful tool behind money is to convince people to vote against their fears.

I agree independents would be awesome (as long as they could actually accomplish things) but without a money machine to back them, there's little chance.
$C: Most of Flint wants clean water, most of Puerto Rico wants power, most of Rural America wants gainful employment, Most Americans in general want Universal Healthcare

$C: We’re a Constitution Republic.
$C: Nope sorry republicans are evil and hate america 

I'm no trump fan but come on people don't over demonize the other side or you'll be just as blind as you think they are

$C: Ah, I can see that position. Not that I agree with it or anything (I am very pro NN and I do think it’s a necessary measure), but I can understand how someone could reasonably think that. I’m not about to start arguing with you or something, I was just curious to hear an opposing opinion.
$C: No, seriously? What's the point of this long gambit you're running to transform America into the worst country in the world? Is it for the lulz? Are you jealous and want to bring America down to your level? I just fundamentally don't understand people who don't value the good and beautiful things in the world.

$C: You're right, he was missing. But his family and friends were also harassed. Plus if he ever did show up again he's got that reputation.
$C: Dead. But it wasn't known he was dead. He was missing at the time (which was why he was suspected, because he was unaccounted for), and he was found to have ~~been murdered~~ committed suicide. Certain redditors took it upon themselves to harass his family members, however. That probably made them feel good.

Edit: thing
$C: Maybe, but that was the defining moment as I remember it.
$C: I like the way you typed that. I feel like it made the sound more real. 
$C: Funny that’s your take about both parties being the same. 
$C: If the election were held today, it's still not certain or even particularly likely that the Dems gain control of the house.  Even then, the GOP is likely to pick up Senate seats due to the map there.  You'd have to start the process of passing a bill again with a less friendly Senate, no guarantee of a Democratic House, and STILL get President Trump to sign it.  In the meantime, the rule repeal goes into effect and the consumer gets screwed.  It's not a good situation.

In this term, what is the path to successfully protecting Net Neutrality?  A "blue wave" won't fix the issue, most likely.  
$C: How does nobody get this? Did everybody skip Schoolhouse Rock day?
$C: Right, but the government is supposed to improve the lives of the people as a whole. Allowing internet prices to rise unregulated is not going to do that. It's a government by the people and for the people
$C: The entire point of my comments are to point out that this is probably a massive waste of time.
$C: They absolutely are, it has nothing to do with free internet. A free internet is one where the FCC isn't in control of it, like you people want.
$C: You absolutely can, I don't see any reason why not.
$C: That’s awesome. I’ve still never been to a protest so kudos!
$C: Lol, sorry I typed this in the airport on mobile between flights
$C: What?
$C: https://www.eff.org/issues/net-neutrality
$C: The definition, given by a quick google search, of Net Neutrality (NN) is: 
"The principle that Internet service providers should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source, and without favoring or blocking particular products or websites."

In the US, proponents of NN want internet service providers (ISPs) to be defined as common carrier services. This would put ISPs under the  47 U.S. Code § 201 - Service and charges.  I encourage you to read this Act and draw your own conclusions.

Also see the Memorandum of Understanding for Restoring Internet Freedom, which is a document between the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to cooperate for certain goals among the two agencies. 
$C: Or google the millions threads already asking the same things 
$C: They're dumb and narrow minded too. I don't care what issue it is or what side you're on. Voting based on one issue is dumb and narrow minded.

It's why we continually get fucked in the ass. For example, gays and blacks will vote democrat even though a lot of their policies are bad for everyone just because they're more friendly to their narrow isses. Likewise with evangelicals or gun enthusiasts.
$C: Yeah but even then at least they're voting FOR something, even if being that narrow-minded is stupid.

But to ignore every other issue and vote for someone you know nothing about because the other one voted on one thing you didn't like. And not even something major, like a bad spending bill or sending us to a war.
$C: Mate he just fucking did.
$C: Lol. And the Democrats aren't? The Democrats are only recently in favor of gay marriage. Both parties will lock you up for weed, spend your social security money on bullshit, send your child to wars we have no business being in, and spy on your communications.

This idea one group of people is evil and one are a bunch of good Samaritans because of party affiliation is hilarious
$C: That's a good question, because Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast are paying off Democrats too, to only a slightly lesser degree. I don't know. 

Maybe it is a partisan thing, with GOP Senators trying to show their loyalty to Trump, but I really hope that's not it either. The best case scenario is they really believe Net Neutrality is bad for the people, but it's weird that that's not what the majority of their supporters believe.

Sorry, I don't have the answers, that's why I was asking.
$C: Until it comes time to pay your student loans and medical bills, then all you have left are your guns.
$C: But their idiotic ideas about private health care mean so much of that money is necessarily tied up in medical costs unlike any civilized, reasonable nation. So they're not always good at that. I guess in a certain way the keeping your guns bit doubles as the plan when you're medically bankrupt.
$C: Why do I care that I get to keep my hard earned money if I then immediately have to spend MORE than the taxes would be on medical insurance?
$C: Literally none of those things
$C: You answered your own question
$C: Pointing out bad regulation doesn't invalidate good regulation.  We absolutely do need to undo corrupt municipal regulations that reinforce local monopolies.  We also need to enforce net neutrality to prevent isps from taking advantage of consumers unfairly.  It is possible to support both issues.
$C: Municipal governments are not aiding and abetting Comcast et al to fuck over anti competitive practices. 
$C: I'm curious where you live. "Water" is used as a synecdoche for the utility, I've never heard anyone anywhere in the US call it anything else. You receive a "water bill," for instance. 
$C: Yeah I think he needs to look up the definition of the word impossible.
$C: Yeah this is a stretch. I see where you're going with it, but if water is to the 10th degree. Gas and electricity are to the 7th. Where as internet is somewhere around the 2nd
$C: Wait what?
$C: I really hope this is /s.. 
$C: Wanting to own a tool to defend your life and the ones you love is not having priorities straight? Self defense is a natural right. Have a good day.
$C: Yeah, the Second Amendment is a thing. While the internet is important, it won't allow you to fight back if a tyrannical government wants to do harm. 
$C: No, PC culture which breeds hostility to people who don't espouse to it.

$C: [deleted]
$C: And yet, the Democrats are seemingly consistently on the side of the greater public. Call it luck if you want. I call it an easy and obvious choice that benefits America 98% of the time.
$C: Lazy answer.

Please find one partisan-divided issue that the GOP was on the right side of in the past 5 years. I'll wait.
$C: Firstly it wont pass the house so no point even talking about a veto.
Secondly do you really think Trump logically would care about the impact on himself of Vetoing a bill. I mean im pretty sure he would think he could Veto it then make a whole garb about it on twitter so his supporters back him. Your problem is you are trying to use logic to determine Trump's behaviour, if the last 2 years have taught us anything it is that there is no logical explanation to Trumps behaviour, apart from his massive massive easily damaged ego.
$C: Unless its like 2/3 vote. Which wont happen unless there are riots in the millions. Which wont happen as well
$C: It's not a different issue. It's the reality. Saying that ISPs won't charge you extra when they can and might possibly charge you less is completely disengenous.

Let's look at your monopoly argument from a net neutrality perspective. A new isp attempts to enter the area to compete with Comcast, you try to go to their website but for some reason it's slow as molasses. You can barely load the main page to see their prices. You get fed up with how slow its running so you give up. After all if they can't even host a website then how good can their service actually be? It turns out that Comcast is "de-prioritizing" that companies traffic in an attempt to stifle the competition.
$C: I know exactly what you meant, and this is not net neutrality.

websites cannot control your access to other websites. comparing FB, twitter, and youtube to ISPs is a complete farce and shows a gross lack of understanding of the actual issue. even google search isn't comparable. 

You're comparing being able to physically prevent access to sites and just not making them easily discoverable. apples and oranges.

>social media giants like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have repeatedly been caught censoring content (primarily from conservatives), blocking, banning or demonetizing users.

Yup on their own platforms. which has no impact outside of their systems. Go implement your own google, facebook, and twitter if you don't like it. Because guess what? that is what net neutrality ensures. The network itself shouldn't care and you're free to implement your own systems when others don't do what you want and you'll have the same access as the big players.

These exact complaints you have against the websites are solvable because net neutrality allows you to build alternatives and receive the same treatment by the network. without net neutrality in place you'd have no options.

>but each case is extremely weak, was immediately fixed, or was a network management issue.

complete bullshit:
none of the major incidents were caused by your claims. and took lawsuits to resolve. I don't know about you but when it requires a law suit to resolve I don't consider that to be 'immediately fixed', or a 'network management issue'.

the very fact that the FCC had to fine and file lawsuits in order for the issues to be resolved points to the necessity of net neutrality rules.

Now if you want to start another movement for preventing censorship and ensuring transparency on the big websites by all means go ahead. Hell I'd likely support that cause if it protects the consumers and small businesses to a similar extent. but saying net neutrality rules are not required when history has proven otherwise and ISPs have repeatedly stated they would violate the rules if they could is the height of stupidity.

$C: Yes, all they had to do was tell you that they were doing it and it becomes untouchable. It was only surreptitious network fuckery that was disallowed.
$C: Not for specific websites, though.  Same speed regardless of the site I’m visiting.  

One of the concerns is they’d have the ability to slow down the sites you like the most to milk more money out of you or push you toward the sites they want you to be on.   I don’t want an ISP taking advantage of me anymore than they already are.

$C: Well, there's this article: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/inside-the-investigation-of-the-boston-marathon-bombing/2013/04/20/19d8c322-a8ff-11e2-b029-8fb7e977ef71_print.html

This is the part you're looking for:  
> On an investigative forum of Reddit.com, since removed from the site, users compiled thousands of photos, studied them for suspicious backpacks and sent their favorite theories spinning out into the wider Internet.

> “Find people carrying black bags,” wrote the Reddit forum’s unnamed moderator. “If they look suspicious, then post them. Then people will try and follow their movements using all the images.”

> The moderator defended this strategy by arguing that “it’s been proven that a crowd of thousands can do things like this much quicker and better. . . . I’d take thousands of people over a select few very smart investigators any day.”

> In addition to being almost universally wrong, the theories developed via social media complicated the official investigation, according to law enforcement officials. Those officials said Saturday that the decision on Thursday to release photos of the two men in baseball caps was meant in part to limit the damage being done to people who were wrongly being targeted as suspects in the news media and on the Internet.
$C: I've been supporting net neutrality since long before Reddit even existed.
$C: So what? Net neutrality is a bipartisan issue anyways
$C: R.I.P in peace 

Hopefully we'll get enough of the Senate during mid-terms to get the two-thirds vote and override the vetom
$C: Yep. Fast and Furious scandal, not bothering to prosecute any bankers, and killing thousands with drone strikes, along with numerous other scandals, were all non issues and merely lies spouted by racist republicans. GOTTEM
$C: [deleted]
$C: >It's been explained already. 

Thanks for confirming what we already know, that you have not a clue what you're talking about.
$C: >It’s perfectly legal

I was specific that the (still) ignored argument is one of ethics. I'll repeat:

*Why is it ethically okay that we demand Verizon be neutral in regards to content? Why aren't we demanding the same of reddit? Indeed, why are we demanding the exact opposite of neutrality when it comes to how reddit treats content?*

I think there are satisfactory answers to this question, but no redditor seems able to distinguish legalities from ethics. 

>this argument is like saying I’m required to allow you to come into a bar and harass people when your only right is to ask for a drink.

My argument (or, rather, my interpretation of another user's argument) has said nothing of requiring reddit (which, presumably, is the bar in this analogy) to do anything. 
$C: Except that it's **Govt Granted** local monopolies. *Without* govt interference ISPs would *have to* provide the service their customers want (in terms of speed, reliability, and *no* censoring / throttling of content
$C: We already have the answer to isp it’s break up monopolies 
$C: Title II protections effectively protect net neutrality. Sorry for using them interchangeably, but you could just substitute "Title II" in place for my comment and my message would be the same. Could you please explain why I guess you think that Title II does not protect net neutrality?
$C: But you wrote a bunch of incorrect bullshit.
$C: The problem is that one could find all sorts of anecdotal evidence for all sorts of things, these things happen all the time and it's fairly easy to find whatever you're looking for.


Basically what you look for is what you're going to see, you create your own perception of the world,   it doesn't make it true. It's a choice.
$C: Let's put in in a hypothetical way that will both scare you and be more relatable to you. 

Warren Buffett and George Soros combine their wealth and buy up all the internet companies they can, then use their majority share of control to throttle and bury all right leaning sites. Pushing them into the dark spaces of the internet and making them both painfully slow and all but unseen in search results.

Without net neutrality, there's nothing to stop that.

It's about Liberty, and the right has lost its way.

You're a moron.

Probably think that if an immigrant doesn’t like it in their host country then they should just leave right? Go back to t_d. Second time you’ve replied this, Russian bot.
$C: Don't worry about it.  You learned and that's what matters.  
$C: Can you help me find that in the law or some reading about it? I find things about "lawful" content which doesn't really seem that controversial. 
$C: The government has been regulating and pursuing violations for 14 years. There has been rules in place for 14 years to prevent exactly what you have "Not seen" what you are about to see is corporate censorship to the biggest buyer. If the government wishes to buy censorship that's very easy to do.
$C: Only jokes here are you and your slave butt buddies cheering to be controlled by the government. It’s pathetic. 
$C: Common sense. 
$C: I'm against regulation in general but since life doesn't revolve around me, I have to be open to compromise. I'd say something that doesn't generalize all ISPs and treats them the same. Maybe putting them into size categories. This would allow small ISPs to grow without being swallowed up by bigger ISPs.

Of course, this is my unprofessional suggestion and there is most likely better ones out there.
$C: Because we’re limited to what we can get. A large potion of this country only has access to one internet provider. Therefore even if they are unhappy with their service, there isn’t another option to change to.

$C: > "Differentiating their networks" sounds good on paper but leads to the very real and likely possibility of them using their networks, (which are under regional monopolies to prevent any competition or "free market" ideas), to actively stifle competition and innovation on the internet?

That's where transparency legislation comes into play, I think. The argument is that by addressing symptoms of bad actors with blanket regulations, we invoke the law of unintended consequences, and just make things more complex. 

The problem is lack of choice, not bad actors. Bad actors come and go. Businesses operating counter to consumers' best interests don't last long in a free market.

Net Neutrality by way of Title II is a white flag of surrender. We aren't even trying to increase competition & choice; We are only attempting to curb feared potential abuses by entrenched bad actors.

I say we back up and try to free the market first. Free markets don't work if they're hogtied.
$C: Not without doxxing myself. But, it's almost as if investment is based on expected future returns and a third layer of approval to roll out fiber (which is part of the proposed rules) would raise costs enough to make future profit less likely.

Google "regulatory capture" and the google "the road to hell is paved with".
$C: It really is quite amusing that this all started because media & streaming companies were worried about losing a few customers if they raised prices. So rather than raise prices to cover costs (or find a sustainable revenue stream), they gaslight the entire internet into thinking ISPs are nickle-and-diming internet access, in hopes of getting regulation that subsidizes them by forcing ISPs to pay for the exorbitant bandwidth costs.


$C: No. Netflix rolled their own CDN and fired Cogent and Amamai and then acted like they shouldn't pay the same fees Akamai and Cogent paid. 

They knew people like you wouldn't understand more than a fucking Linksys quick start poster and got their way.
$C: Sh!thead...NN has NOT been in place for a DOZEN YEARS. OBUMMER IMPLEMENTED IT. You clearly are a YOUNG IDIOT. You clearly have NO CLUE. 

People were TOLD NN was one thing...WHEN in REALITY it was a completely different thing. All the examples given were FARCICAL. 

The BIG providers were ALL FOR IT...WHY? Because they could ABSORB the COST of the BULLCRAP REGULATIONS. It would ELIMINATE the SMALL PLAYERS. 

Government is NEVER the solution.

$C: > The FTC hasn't acted on these constant mergers and monopolies

They have, take a look at the FTC lawsuits from the last decade. It sounds like you don't know how the FCC or the FTC works or how they are different from one another.

>The Federal Trade Commission has the power to “stop and prevent business practices that are likely to reduce competition and lead to higher prices, reduced quality or levels of service, and less innovation.” This should be perfectly sufficient to protect the internet from the problems Net Neutrality supporters claim to fear.

>And, if that is not enough, the U.S. Department of Justice is charged with enforcing antitrust laws and principles, which allegedly “protect economic freedom and opportunity by promoting free and fair competition in the marketplace.“

The way the NN-program works is there's pages and pages of rules that ISP's have to establish to the agency before they get their right to actually be an ISP to consumers. What this ends up doing is severely limiting any new ISP startups from trying to steal market shares from the bigger ISP groups who don't have competition.

There are things we can implement to try and make steps into solving the issue with the ISP monopolies, which could include; access to infrastructure in a timely and cost efficient manner, benefits to start-ups(loans, taxes). 

Another problem with NN-program is that edge-content sites like Google, Youtube, Facebook, Reddit are protected against FTC lawsuits where they are constantly found abusing data, censoring and discriminating unfairly against it's consumers.


$C: The DNC platform plank on this is the FCC should add tons of regulation. The GOP plank is, existing regulation is sufficient if the FCC would stop blocking the FTC in a desperate attempt to remain relavent in a digital world.

Many states have already implemented "no traffic discrimination" laws after the FCCs decision, and they've all done it right: they ignored 99% of the Title 2 law and ONLY said "treat all network traffic the same." Since you seem to hold blinding malice for the Republican party, you think you'd be glad to hear that they're getting punished by not implementing a NN law.

$C: The FCC ruled against Comcast for blocking bittorrent in 2008.  The current net neutrality rules didn't even exist then.

So your comment indirectly proves that this wasn't necessary.

Existing legislation pretty well protects the consumer from things like that.  The new stuff is essentially fighting for large content providers under the guise of fighting for consumers.
$C: All of that would be solved by ISP competition. 

The end user (you and me) suffers from any battle tech companies have with ISPs because we are locked into a situation where we only have one ISP to  choose from. Those ISPs are forced to provide cheap services for those tech companies. ATT blocking FaceTime is a "fuck you" to Apple, not us.

The question you should ask is: why aren't tech companies advocating for more ISP competition? The answer probably has to do with money.

 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

This whole thing could be solved with a two-tiered system of ISP-user agreements. One plan for end users like you and me and a different plan fro giant bandwidth using corporations like Google and Netflix.  
$C: Thanks for educating me more on the matter and clearing up some confusion. I appreciate it. 
$C: Your comment is as much "appeal to the stone" as it is a "straw man."

In fact I suspect you’re working in cahoots with them or you’re the same person. 
$C: >I understand you're a liberal 

Howso?

I understand you're a troll, but Reddit has 330 million users. Facebook has ***2.19 billion***. Hello, hello, anybody home? Hey, think, McFly. If I can spot more than 13 trolls _in one fucking thread_ on a site with a fraction of the userbase of Facebook, what do you think are the chances there were just 13 on Facebook?
$C: Who said anything about policing the content of the internet? We just want ISPs to have to give everyone fair access to the internet. 

If my ISP advertises 100/100, I expect to go anywhere I want with that speed, provided the guy at the other end has the same capability. Net Neutrality guarantees this. 

The alternative, and we've seen this in Mexico, is that you  pay for 100/100, but if you want to view content in competition of the ISP, then you either pay more, or it's blocked/throttled. Want access to Facebook? It's yours for an additional $5/mo! Want to view content from ABC even though you're using Comcast (owner of NBC)? It's all yours for $10/mo!

I'm sorry that you're a whore to fake orwellian fearmongering.
$C: John Oliver is that you?
$C: Except that you can not offer nor advertise a "slower" speed on the same network.  That falls under "data prioritization".
$C: Not on a network that has a higher data capacity.  It is then branded discriminatory.  Advertising DSL and Cable is allowed, but limiting access between 3.0 Mb/s and 15.0 Mb/s on the same network is not allowed as the slower speed is being 'discriminated' against.  Which is dumb, but that is what the current incarnation of Net Neutrality boils down to.  That, and not allowing certain types/accesses of data to not count towards data caps.

Eh, I see pro/con to data caps.  The alternative is a billing scheme of x$ per unit data like $0.10/MB. 

Really what it boils down to it people writing laws that have no idea how the subject works.  So, Congress in general.

**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.

$C: They don't.  Big companies like Netflix and Google just love the little guy and regularly spend time and money on things that they have no financial interest in.

There certainly aren't things called peering agreements that cost them money that NN regulation would seek to ban.
$C: I guess because ISP's won't be able to charge websites but I hardly would say that is helping corporations as most websites aren't that big to deserve the title
$C: This all started because Netflix did not like the paid transit pricing of a carrier. Then they or the carrier made video quality shitty (debate out there on who). The battle between eyeballs and content companies have been around since day 1 of the commercial web. Nothing new. We thrived without government heavy hand involvement up until NN was dreamed up.

If government played to the highest campaign donors and kickback providers from the beginning, you would still be locked into dial up and AOL. I can always walk away from a company I don't want. Same can't be said of corrupt bureaucrats and lawmakers. Outside of anti monopoly blocking, the government should stay out of the internet. It's not a utility, despite people trying to argue it is.
$C: the guy who deserve more respect was john mc cain. he actually acting like maverick for once.

then again, he seems like coping with the possibility of death and he doesnt want to be remembered as a shitty senator.
$C: 1. Companies are not stupid. If they throttle Netflix, their customers will just switch to a carrier that doesn't throttle Netflix.

2. Yes, I AM restricting myself. Why should I pay for high-speed internet on every website if I only NEED it on Netflix and YouTube? I am wasteing money!
$C: We don't need preventative regulation. If companies are doing something bad, then we can make the regulations. Preventative regulation stifles growth and competition, and drives up prices.
$C: And there's no government regulation that permits new startups to bypass oppressive regulations while protecting said startups from abusive legal practices.

The free market deals with both of these issues by not allowing those monopolies leverage to litigate using regulation they drafted just for that purpose.  Who do you think the related tort law was written by?
$C: Good good human bot bot.
$C: [deleted]
$C: And how does cutting out the government and just letting ISP's do all the censoring/throttling for them help the situation at all?

Gov's gonna shade, and your average joe is helpless to that. 
$C: > Data that comes from content providers such as Netflix needs to be prioritized because of the nature of it and the order of the packages matter. Given how much network bandwidth Netflix uses, this creates extraordinary strain on managing networks, which drives up the costs. Right now, that cost is spread onto all the users of the network, even those who don't use Netflix. 

Sorry, but no. ISP's had bandwidth limits, if you exceed it, they throttle your connection. 

If lots of people use the internet at the same time, oh no, sometimes it slows down. That's just the nature of the beast. If ISPs wanted to fix that, they'd actually roll out the fiber network that the government already gave them hundreds of millions in free money to roll out. 
$C: Cause she isn't paying to use the network in such a way.

That's part of the drawback of paying for less speed, you'll get less speed.

If you somehow find an email server willing to upload at high speeds and you have a high download speed, nothing will stop you from getting that email really super fast, you know. Just really hard to find such a server.

Netflix pays to deliver content at a high speed, I pay to download it at a high speed. I put it in my QOS to prioritize netflix over other data, so I can watch things.

If the grandma isn't getting emails at the speed she pays for \*\*as well\*\* as the speed that the uploader pays for, then she should complain to the ISP for selling her a product that they can't deliver on.

That's who's at fault, you know, in this hypothetical. It would be on the ISP to be able to deliver the service they sell. If they can't support something they sell, then they shouldn't be selling it.

Don't blame people for using the service they pay for.
$C: How do you know that if you aren’t even willing to see if it’s better?
$C: It also makes it so that they can speed websites up. You’re assuming the worst of people. Basically what I’m willing to bet is that most ISPs will use this to make it so that websites visited by less people will be slower and the ones visited by more people will be faster. Either way I’m willing to bet you won’t notice a difference. 
$C: And then they lose customers.

I don't see what they _might do_ as a reason for applying an ill-fitting regulatory standard on the entire internet.

Look up ex post vs ex ante regulation.
$C: Before calling someone retarded get your facts right first:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States#Regulatory_history

NN as a concept was being enforced since the 1980s under various laws. Title II just the most recent law under which it was being enforced, which is 2 years old.
$C: Governments have done that and are doing that. 

Corporations only have that kind of power in science-fiction. 
$C: >Corporations have already managed to embroil America in the Iraq war for the sake of oil. Plenty of needless death there.

TIL government declaring war should be blamed on capitalism and not government.
$C: > Corporations have all the real power in America now. Not the government. 


That's why the government bribes the corporations and not the other way around. Right?
$C: And I should care about your arguement because you care about the other side's so deeply right?

Take your Logic 101 bullshit elsewhere, it never actually looks like you're winning. Just being a pretentious commenter that uses arbitrary philosophy to make his own arguement look good. Which it doesn't.
$C: > ISPs have locked down any chance of competion with regional monopolies.

Then break up the monopolies. Solve the issue at the source.
$C: My point is those so called examples are probably based on misleading information, as evidenced by the fact that nothing has changed now that net neutrality is gone.


$C: But you can switch to a different ISP. Everyone knows Comcast is terrible. They're listed as the most hated company of all time on a regular basis. When a company behaves in a way that's unacceptable, you switch to their competitor. You'll end up with a better ISP, and Comcast gets to wallow in their failure and strive to win back their lost customers.
$C: What does that have to do with anything? You don't have to like the repeal to support it, you just have to support it to support it.
$C: So?
$C: Again whos admin repealed net neutrality? 
$C: So im bisexual and grew up poor. I dont have the luxury of ignoring politics because people will decide my future for me if i do. Theyre doing it to you right now. But go ahead and be ignorant. 

And bush i didnt sgree with. Trump is a different animal. This isnt about disagreeing over politics its about what makes a person a decent human being.
$C: 1. What i said was "what about all the trump voters on reddit who made repeal possible."

2.replubicans may not be trump supporters. I like plenty of conservatives who didnt vote dor the current president. 

3. We continue to see day old accounts and users posting at peculiar times on certain subs. Many frequemt redditors find this strange. 

4. I did not need mean to imply bitching. I am frustrated at the state of my home and concerned about the future.

Me: "Stop censoring free speech."

You: "You're confused. That's the point of NN."

Me: "Explain this."

You: "That's not the point of NN."

At the very least, you should explain why *de\-platforming websites at the domain name service level* is acceptable in any way, and not comparable to hypothetical ISP censorship with no grounds in reality. This was literally an unprecedented escalation of the Democratic Party's War on Free Speech when they got CloudFlare and Google to completely cut off *The Daily Stormer* from the internet, and it's not exactly like you can purchase a Raspberry Pi or AWS space and start renting names directly yourself from ICANN. They've got to be equally as much of a "utility" or whatever as any cable company. It was such an unprecedented act that even Bane of Soyboys everywhere, Ajit Pai, mentioned it in his white paper justifying the repeal of net neutrality. 

[https://squawker.org/politics/fcc\-chairman\-ajit\-pai\-defends\-the\-daily\-stormer\-as\-net\-neutrality\-war\-heats\-up/](https://squawker.org/politics/fcc-chairman-ajit-pai-defends-the-daily-stormer-as-net-neutrality-war-heats-up/)

He may be a white supremacist of color, and all, but that doesn't matter. You'll have to do a much better job of explaining to me why I have an obligation to support net neutrality when it doesn't even *make an attempt* to address the things I care about, while it directly lines the pockets of the wealthiest few who are responsible for them.

I'd also love to hear you try and spin how Diamond & Silk is hate speech.
$C: Yes. Just like we allow reddit to censor content. Or any private company. Because the first amendment only applies to the government. Surely you know and understand that as a good reddit line toer you are. Surely you wouldn't want your beloved r/politics subject to the same free speech laws you suddenly want to subject private companies too? I can guarantee you've cried out the reddit cliche "but muh first amendment only applies to governments" line more times than I can count when it comes to defending your safe spaces and echo chambers.

Because if an ISP censors content you want, you're free to leave and use a competitor. So long as competitors exist... which they often don't currently, because government overregulation has created and propped up artificial monopolies. 
$C: I am definitely not disputing your claim but using anecdotal evidence to support your position doesn't sit well with me. (I guess I did it as well) It is unfortunate this happens and imo making internet a public utility is not as simplistic as it may seem. How many electric companies can you choose from in your area? One most likely and they control the monopoly like in Georgia where you pay double kw per hour during summer with zero choices. I understand your plight and frustration but again I feel other avenues are a far better option instead of anointed government as the answer to our problem which is dangerous and will most likely destroy our only free enterprise. Once their meddling starts we will never again remove their ever extending tentacles. Don't we have anti-trust laws for this very thing? To be honest I would just like everyone to be honest and forthright about it and have a debate based on facts instead of hyperbole and exaggerations.
$C: You said there were little facts, that means there were some, list them that you disagreed with and provide a detailed explanation as to how things would be better with net neutrality regulations.  
$C: [deleted]
$C: Your provided article just backs up my side. What was the point of the 2015 rules if they didn't prevent T-mobile. It seems the rules mostly existed to ensure existing ISP didn't have to worry about competition by requiring them to have such a large regulatory bureaucracy that new companies or potentials companies couldn't even afford to compete. 


$C: I can tell by your final sentence that you didn't read my comment. Never claimed removing the 2015 rules were perfect. I actually advocated for the crafting of new legislation.
$C: That's when they changed the definition, under the guise of equal speeds.it's like calling a bill that allows spying on its citizens the Patiriot Act, to make it seem good. 

If you didn't like Verizon doing that then get another provider. They'd lose enough customers to stop doing it eventually 

People are still waiting for Google fibre that was promised and never delivered.
$C: Fuck that's not how that works 
$C: You want to treat it like a pre\-launch campaign, with the hardcore "launch" campaign hitting either at re\-election time or leading up to legislative voting sessions depending on what comes first... if re\-election campaigns end up being first we'll have to do it again when the congressional voting session is imminent. 
$C: People just need a reminder that we're not a bunch of quitters. Politics is hard, its something people devote their whole lives to and the good fight will not be won overnight.
$C: That may have applied to previous generations, but it feels like people are more energized now than ever
$C: Idk man I think the best message is just to take a shit on every house members door step that doesn't support it. Then light it on fire and ring the door bell. Do this every day and they will get the picture.

Edit: My phone changed shit to.....shot as if shit is worse how the fuck do I stop my phone censoring me...wtf 
$C: That's part of what the tea party was. Start throwing incumbents out that don't represent. That's also why trump got a very large vote. Career politicians, your voting base has your number.

One rep I greatly appreciate and I'm sad to see go is trey gowdy.

$C: Are you really going to call me not very smart when the grammar in your response is so completely horrendous? Also, i happen to have the belief that net neutrality encourages free speech and free distribution of press. Instead of attacking me personally, why don’t you come at me with facts? I expect ad hominem from the libtards, but not from conservatives... come on man be better than that

$C: Maybe. But whether or not it actually *is* correct, if you're a voter who supports NN and is represented by a Republican, it's in your best interest to try to make them *feel like* it's incorrect.
$C: If rallying people to my causes was contingent upon the internet being a platform, I wouldn't need to be fighting anymore.
$C: I guess I'm just going to be that guy and say "Net Neutrality is less important." The Internet is primarily a (great) means of communication, which is very significant but ultimately less essential than food, healthcare, shelter, properly representative government, and general egalitarianism. It bothers me that this is somehow lauded as the great issue of the day. We reduce ourselves to this, rather than taking aim at the problems that allow such heinous and unpopular legislation to be introduced, let ALONE passed, in the first place.

We need to aim higher. We need to do better. We cannot and should not depend on politicians to make the changes that must be made. We have power beyond the governing body of the U.S., and we must show it.
$C: Waiting for elections to roll around is not a sufficient answer when we have such blatant corruption. In engaging these people on their terms we are implicitly agreeing that to some extent they represent our interests.We cede more ground with every revealed GOP controversy which we trust our clearly corrupt government to handle. We the people are the government, not our elected representatives. If those Representatives do not represent us, we must do more, we must push harder, to mitigate and remove their damaging effects.
$C: > The president has shown that he can be swayed by how much people pay him.

$C: That’s right, and unfortunately content providers have abused the good will of the public through mass surveillance and censorship while getting a free ride taking advantage of service providers. 

Facebook is a CIA Op (formerly LifeLog), and Amazon has a $600 million CIA contract.  Google is contracted by DARPA. The list goes on.

$C: See this is what the same smug liberals said though about Hillary winning. They were so sure that most people in this country are rational individuals and that was their downfall, too much faith in the American people.
$C: Yep! I've written first drafts of op-eds on behalf of my bosses before, and they were eventually published (I mean granted, especially in the Senator's case, they could submit absolute drivel and it would still get in the paper, so my writing might have been shit), so I think these tips, which I used, should work. I'm drawing this information directly from theopedproject.org, which I highly recommend visiting yourself, but I'll copy the main parts down here and annotate what I think is important. 


**Tips for Op-Ed Writing** 

1. Own your expertise
Know what you are an expert in and why - but don’t limit yourself. Consider the metaphors that your experience and knowledge suggest.

2. Stay current
Follow the news – both general and specific to your areas of specialty. If you write about Haiti, read the Haitian press. If you write about pop culture, read the media that cover it. 

3. The perfect is the enemy of the good
In other words: write fast. You may have only a few hours to get your piece in before the moment is gone. But also…

4. Cultivate a flexible mind
Remember that a good idea may have more than one news hook, indeed if the idea is important enough it can have many. So keep an eye out for surprising connections and new news hooks – the opportunity may come around again.

5. Use plain language
Jargon serves a purpose, but it is rarely useful in public debate, and can obfuscate – sorry, I mean cloud – your argument. Speak to your reader in straight talk. 

6. Respect your reader
Never underestimate your reader’s intelligence, or overestimate her level of information. Recognize that your average reader is not an expert in your topic, and that the onus is on you to capture her attention – and make the argument compelling.

**Questions for Op-Ed Writers**

1. Why should we readers trust you? Are you authoritative on your topic? Are you accountable to what you say you know? Can you provide evidence of your expertise? You don’t need to have a famous name, a big title, or a fancy degree – but you do need to be well positioned to speak on your topic, and able to convey it. [u/Blightking's note: you might be just a concerned citizen, but you are also an *informed* citizen. Remember who your audience is in this circumstance. You're talking to your representative. You have the authority to write on their policy because you are affected by what they do.]

2. Can you back up what you say? Is your argument based on evidence – solid material and logical building blocks that will be acknowledged as credible even by those who may disagree with your interpretation? 

3. What’s new? Is your argument different, particularly original in the way it is delivered, or is it backed up by substantially new information or reporting? What is compelling about its contribution to the conversation?

4. So what? Why should everyone else – including those of us who are not experts in your area – care? 

5. What’s the difference between being “right” and being “effective”? Does your language tend to write off the people who would disagree with you, or do you employ empathy and respect in the pursuit of changing minds? [u/Blightking's note: You don't want to be too critical of your representative: even if they end up reading your article they and their staff will be turned off, and then we're back at square one. Instead, try to appeal to them]

6. How will your ideas and arguments contribute to the conversation, and be helpful to your audience? Do you see your knowledge and experience in terms of its potential value to others?


I'll provide a basic structure here, but you can feel free to mess with it: this just goes hand in hand into good essay writing.

* Lede (Around a news hook)

* Thesis (Statement of argument – either explicit or implied)
* Argument: Based on evidence (such as stats, news, reports from credible organizations, expert quotes, scholarship, history, first-hand experience)
* 1st Point – evidence – evidence - conclusion
* 2nd Point- evidence – evidence - conclusion
* 3rd Point – evidence – evidence – conclusion
Note: In a simple, declarative op-ed (“policy X is bad; here’s why”) , this may be straightforward. In a more complex commentary, the 3rd point may expand on the bigger picture—historical context, global/geographic picture, mythological underpinnings, etc.—or may offer an explanation for a mystery that underpins the argument– eg., why a bad policy continues, in spite of its failures.

* A “To Be Sure” paragraph (in which you pre-empt your potential critics by acknowledging any flaws in your argument, and address any obvious counter-arguments.)

* Conclusion (often circling back to your lede)

The most important part of the op-ed is the lede; you must have this, and here's some tips on how to make a good one.

From the Op-ed project:

A lede is what sets the scene and grabs your reader’s attention – it is your introduction.  A news hook is what makes your piece timely, and often is part of the lede.  Be bold, but incontrovertible.  Tell an anecdote, if it illustrates your point.  Use humor, if appropriate. Use clean sentences.  A few possibilities (from real op-eds):

*Use the News*

This Wednesday evening Frances Newton, 40, will be put to death for the murders of her husband and two children 18 years ago…

*Tell a dramatic anecdote*

Ten years ago, I asked Bosnian civilians under siege in Sarjevo where they would go if they could escape… 

*Reference popular culture*

The marketing campaign shows real women, rather than anorectic teenagers, in white bras and panties posing next to the slogan “New Dove Firming. As tested on real curves”…  [u/Blightking's note: This might be good for grabbing the newspaper's attention, and may best suited towards your own experience. Again, go with what you know]

*Turn conventional wisdom on end*   

Sex and the City’s main characters are witty, glamorous, independent and sexually liberated – in short, who wouldn’t want to be them?  Me, for one. 

*Use wit and irony to point out a contradiction*

So now we know what “noble cause” Cindy Sheehan’s son died for in Iraq: Sharia. It’s a good thing W stands for women, or I’d be worried.  

*Use an anniversary* 

Fifty years after the Supreme Court banned school segregation, the battle over the racial composition of America' s schools continues in courtrooms across the country.

*Cite a major new study*

According to a new nation-wide poll, 60% of women have cheated on their husbands at least once.  

*Get Personal*

College admissions officers around the country will be reading my applications this month, essays in which I describe personal aspirations, academic goals -- even, in one case, a budding passion for the sitar. What they won't know is that I actually graduated from college more than a year ago, and that the names attached to these essays are those of my duplicitous clients.


And that's all from the Op-ed project. Again, I recommend going on the site. Good luck!



$C: Mention the name, call on the Rep for action, but make sure you arent too harsh or confrontational or you will shoot yourself in the foot
$C: "PC load letter...

The fuck does that mean?"


I love that movie.
$C: And sending an email is free. 
$C: Just as an appendix with the front page being a simple tally stating number who supported or opposed it. If you provide the same boiler plate template message, it's chance of standing out is zero.
$C: Hard letters do not matter more than emails, no. And they take an average of 3 weeks to arrive.
$C: If you use the same template for the message, it looks obvious. I say that when I see the same thing at the local government level.
$C: Yeah that's why I emailed my congressman 
$C: he can't ignore it.
$C: Ooh, me too! I'll take anything significantly above minimum wage!
$C: [deleted]
$C: Granted!
$C: Wow, a downvoted gallowboob comment in the wild. A rare sight indeed
$C: Hire me three, gracias
$C: Look kids! A wild u/GallowBoob! 
$C: Stop editing the post. Man up and take whatever up or down votes comes to you. 
$C: Nice try ISP rep.
$C: So are you a paid shill, or just misinformed? 
$C: Literally found u/spez
$C: I know right, kinda want to see it but I know truly that all it means is Swastikas, Burning Crosses, and other repugnant shit on the front page/header.
$C: Yea I am pretty certain that it will involve Hitler and his glorious record of doing the right things.
$C: I'm not entirely sure about that. Take a look at /r/place. A large portion of the userbase self-organised and worked to create something greater without outside instruction. Even the void, the "evil" of /r/place turned out to be a benevolent force in being the "garbage collectors". Hell, even kekistan kept to their own little (well, somewhat large) corner.
$C: Only to the kinds of people who open bags of chips with scissors
$C: and unbanned
$C: I keep hearing disaster like it's a bad thing.  It's the whole idea.
$C: You can actually change it to default to "old" on the user settings without the prefix being on.
$C: On the new site, click your username in the top right and go down to "Opt out of redesign" or whatever.
$C: There are also firefox and chrome extensions that will automatically change the url to old.reddit
$C: Reddit is slowly turning in to everything I grew to hate about Digg. Digg v4 drove me here. If this new redesign becomes mandatory I will not be sticking around.
$C: lol
$C: But money and short term profits! Screw the long term, they want money now!
$C: Its an option under the "preferences" menu at the top bar (of the old design)
$C: I've noticed this as well. If I browse Reddit from somewhere other than my home computer (i.e. if I'm not logged in) I can see the redesign. It caught me completely by surprise yesterday though because it's not how Reddit looks for me usually. I can only guess they're slowly easing longer time members into the redesign?
$C: Good bot
$C: Don't bother. Just go a few pages in the guy's history and you'll see it's just one of those self-righteous douches with his head way up his own ass.
$C: > Just replying so I can be updated on the absolute fucking massacre that will take place here.

I'm used to ignorant people attacking my position on Net Neutrality. The picture used in Reddit's (other) top post about Net Neutrality today had a "Don't Tread On Me" Gadsden flag parody.

The Gadsden flag is a small-government flag. Net Neutrality is a large government regulation where the government controls businesses and how they provide internet. It is the opposite of what the Gadsden flag represents.

I'm not particularly afraid of people who don't know what they're talking about.
$C: > Do you like the idea of your internet being regulated? 

Net Neutrality is literally a government regulation.
$C: Trumpsters: remaining fully divorced from reality for over two years and counting.

$C: Well since that is not what happened, I hope you are awake enough to know that. 
$C: See you in seven years!
$C: Oh they must have had a fox and friends special on it already. 
$C: Assuming it passed the house to begin with, it only goes back to the Senate, but needs 2/3rds, which we won't get.
$C: Pretty basic government stuff, but any bill that passes the house and senate goes to the president. He can choose to veto it, in which case it goes back to the senate and house and they need a 2/3 majority vote to override the veto
$C: Your honesty is refreshing. Your participation in politics is terrifying. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Not a chance in hell.
$C: Not close enough to election to matter. The people in politics without the memory of a gold fish already know who they're voting for. Those with a memory of a gold fish let events in the last two weeks leading to the polls determine the vote. Ie the precise reason the trump presidency can be inundated with scandals and be president. Not enough people are not apathetic. 
$C: Which is why it will never get out of committee.  
$C: Almost every Republican senator just voted against it.  Expect the same in the house.
$C: The Hastert rule is such a disgusting affront to democracy. Fuck that nasty pedophile.
$C: Non-Mobile link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hastert_Rule

$C: Worse, Sean Hannity, John Bolton, and Alex Jones.
$C: I know I'm saying that they say something on Fox and Friends and within 2 hours Trump has made it his new life mission for the next couple tweets.

I almost think Rupert Murdoch would make better decisions, since... he kinda actually has money the last thing he'd want is a global financial crisis. We all know the only money Trump has left is the money the Russians loaned to him when no one else would because "The Russians really like golf" ~Donald Trump Jr when asked why Russians would give loans for golf courses when golf is doing badly.
$C: Accurate
$C: “We’re only just waking up to it.” - This is a joke right?
$C: They were farmed fish... From China... happened right after Trump did stupid bullshit like he always does...

Still got like 10 more years of raping the ocean of all of it's fish in the mean time. Things we got from China LITERALLY went up in price the same time Trump was doing random tariffs. Try again.
$C: Rule 2: There are heuristics
$C: I heard this isn't getting voted on until January? Which means that if the Democrats make huge gains, it could pass the house
$C: They also know that GOP voters do nothing more than look for the (R) and check that box.

The GOP, especially the house reps, have nothing to worry about, as their constituents don't even know who they are.

That's why the GOP goes after the low info voters.  Not only are they super easy to manipulate and mislead, they're also too stupid to do anything about it even if they do eventually get pissed off.

Just go look up some of the vids/interviews of GOP supporters when they were getting all pissed about the ACA.  They'd talk about how they hate X rep, but would also say they'd still never vote for a democrat.

The GOP is a system, it doesn't care about individuals.  The person doesn't matter, just that they are a party slave.  The individual politicians are all carbon copies of each other and do whatever the "main office" (or whatever you want to call it....fox news....) says.

The only thing different is the varying degrees of extremism/stupidity.
$C: Then keep electing cretins and lose your freedoms/status
$C: Is it discontent? It's the only real way I can see his statements reverberating as much as they did.

Regardless... I may have an idea...
$C: We can only hope...
$C: Yeah that's true. Fingers crossed.
$C: You're probably right. I should look up other pending bills because while there's so much talk it would be foolish to believe in blind that there's meaningful actions taken.
$C: That's a negative, my parents are really poor and I was poor growing up, the tax cut was not for the rich and super rich. It helped the poor and middle class. Know it first hand from my parents. There doing better than they ever have financially.
$C: No sucking here. The people spoke when he was elected when the media and everyone was against him. He will be in for a 2nd term.
$C: Me too, I'm colorblind though 😢 
$C: Murder enough hobos every day, and everything ends up looking red on your mobile app.
$C: I hate sheep They are the type you can put Charles Manson vs John Wayne Gacy on the ballot and   the sides will justify their vote by saying its better than a dirty democract/repugnant Republican
Honestly I wish their was a knowledge test for voting that you have to prove you know what you are doing to vote....of course then almost no poliitican could vote for themselves lol
$C: Perhaps I should have specified “skeletons” re progressives. She is a neocon hawk whereas Bernie is a democratic socialist, so of course she would have more skeletons in this sense 
$C: Fuck you man, I did vote for Clinton
$C: Trump’s skeletons are so numerous they’re considering their own run for office after our 8 years of trump hell. Accept it. Live with it. We’re stuck with this shit heap for the long run. If Mueller was going to do anything about it we would have seen it by now. /cynicism (I hope)
$C: I don’t think what I wrote is bullshit, I am extremely liberal. Hillary was verifiably a centrist whose charisma stats are negative. Where is the bullshit?! It seems obvious to me that she was the weaker candidate, precisely because she didn’t engender the same enthusiasm (as Bernie or Obama). 
$C: Remember when Hillary was paid millions and millions of dollars in speaking fees from foreign governments, who then secured very large arms deals? Pepperidge Farm remembers.
$C: Mary Mahoney is one skeleton.  
$C: Hillary Clinton was kicked out of the watergate investigation for being corrupt (not a joke). 
$C: Whereas Bernie would probably not have which proves my point...?
$C: \>   thanks to thanks to the sheer power of stupidity. 

Yeah, you gotta be real stupid to lose to someone like that.

\>  A sexist, misogynist pig of a man, elected 'President' of a powerful first world nation, by a large number of gullible, misinformed populace. 

Ahh right, the same people who elected Obama 4 years before? Oh.....
$C: Imagine not being embarrassed or feeling like a dweeb by making a comment like this. 

You’re the type of guy who calls trump GEOTUS in public. Even fellow Trump supporters think you’re awkward. 
$C: Or spelling it right, if they wanted
$C: Fraud...  I like that.  Totally fits too. :)
$C: So a frog cartoon is now a symbol of Nazis? 

Even though antifa uses the same flag from the Nazis?
$C: Yeah, right? I always feel intimidated by their incredible intelligence.
$C: He literally threatens to "take the credentials" of news organizations that report unflattering news about him.

He shits on the parts on the constitution he dislikes...specifically, the first amendment.
$C: Same as bakeries decorating cakes then?
$C: This is true.
$C: Yes. It is rare though. Only 106 have been overridden out of 1484 vetoes. 
$C: Yes, but a vetos historically burn a lot of bridges between legislators and the President. Even Trump might not want to risk his tenuous standing with the legislative branch to veto such a popular bill, especially since it doesn't have anything to do with his core mission.
$C: Given his inconsistent consistency, I’m not sure that means a lot. So far he has signed every single bill that has been placed in front of him.

I didn’t vote for him. You didn’t vote for him. But you have to admit your evidence is lacking; don’t let your distrust and dislike of Trump effect your judgement.
$C: > LEO high speed Internet.

Satellite internet is terrible for gaming, and with heavy cloud cover. I don't think think that's a threat to most ISPs.
$C: Example? 
$C: But fox news told me there might be some poop crumbs hidden in the bologna! Better eat the turds, at least they are upfront about what they are.
$C: Exactly.
$C: Beautiful 
$C: This is pretty naive. There are good parts and bad parts to any political party, just as there are good parts and bad parts to any person or company. You have to be a pretty cynical person to think that every politician is corrupt on any side of the political spectrum. I'm not particularly fond of one of the parties, but I guarantee there are some positions some of them hold that I agree with. It might mean I have to engage with them and be discerning, but that's a worthwhile pursuit if it means avoiding prejudice.
$C: Both parties support the inherent oppression of the working class that is present in a capitalist system. The parties just cater to different social strata by fucking them slightly less hard than others. I understand your point, but if you want anything to change the only way is through a working class revolution, not by hoping things will get slightly less shitty year after year.
$C: I thought it was a turd sandwich or a giant douche
$C: I'm not sure America is dead.

With all due respect, I think this is a really shitty, exaggerated analogy. I do however agree that one party is the lesser of evils. 
$C: That sort of logic is what got us in this position in the first place. Because we always vote “lesser of two evils,” we eventually degrade the position until we have Trump/Hillary.

In fact, we now have people trying to kill off the Electoral College, an important part of the entire democratic republic system. Without it, the smaller population states practically have no vote.
$C: Nah it's more like choosing between two different dildos to fuck you
$C: What kind of analogy is this?

“hurr durr im always right repubikans are dummies XD”
$C: I would say the republican party is worse than that and the democrats are liquid dog turds.
$C: Nah you right. A good party should always scheme against its own candidates. 
$C: Well, at least 6 Dem senators are [supporting](https://twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/996494083366506496) an actual torturer for CIA Director, so I'd say that's pretty poor decision making. Especially when it's very likely that Haspel's nomination would be blocked without Democratic support.

EDIT: If anyone is curious, here are the Democratic senators who have announced support for Haspel:

* Mark Warner (D-VA)
* Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND)
* Bill Nelson (D-FL)
*  Joe Manchin (D-WV)
* Joe Donnelly (D-IN) 
* Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH)
$C: It's ok buddy, I was super confused at first too and wondering why things seemed back to front - I am Australian though, so I'm lucky I wasn't seeing it upside down as well 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our Democracy
$C: Exclusively by the right? I hear this line almost exclusively from extreme left wingers / socialists complaining about the Democratic party, especially with respect to their cozy relations with corporations.
$C: They may not be exactly the same, but Democrats will not fight for the jobs, healthcare, education, green new deal, etc. that we need. Neither stagnation nor incrementalism will suffice to get us out of this massive income inequality which is dragging quality of life way down. 
$C: Imo there's true libertarians and those in the alt-right who adopt the phrase. True libertarians believe in total self-regulation, in business and in private. So no EPA, no SEC, either shrinking or eliminating the IRS and getting rid of almost all taxes, total liaise-faire capitalism, all drugs are legal, no restrictions on guns, etc. To them, government should only exist to pretty much defend our borders and provide extremely basic amenities, like clean water. But even that gets debated. 

It sounds like anarchy, but their argument is that the shitty people in society will get shoved out of it by those that want a good life. If you rip off all your customers, they will go to your competition and you'll have to start improving how you conduct yourself. If you run a druggy trap house your neighbors will force you to leave, and there won't be a city regulation protecting them. 

The alt-right people who kind-of-sometimes claim to be libertarians are largely more just far right. They want regulations and a government that favors them and their ideals, not an actual society that will harshly judge idiots using the mighty blade of capitalism. 

I think both miss that government is essential to keeping a semblance of freedom, even with the cost of regulations. Monopolies have existed many times before.  
$C: Libertarians basically want the same thing as Dr. Horrible \- "Anarchy, that I run!"

They want a society where they are on top and nothing can stop them from doing what they want.
$C: Because anarchy hurts blacks more than itll hurt whites.
$C: Yes, libertarian has a very different meaning in the states. It is a philosophy that prioritizes liberty based on self-ownership and private property rights. In the states the extreme end of libertarianism is anarcho-capitalism rather than anarcho-communism. 
$C: US libertarians in the US are called "anarcho\-capitalists" in most places, I believe. They tend to be authoritarian, but also anti\-government.
$C: Incorrect. Libertarians oppose both the monopoly *and* Net Neutrality.
$C: I consider myself closest to Libertarian (though like most people, I don’t perfectly line up with any party), and this is exactly it. The fact that the society we set up now requires internet access to function in work and school, and that there is a government granted monopoly and at this stage, even if the rules suddenly change, how would a company even get access to this market? The project to expand access would be a very large one. Since removing all government regulations and starting a competitive market is not reasonable at this time, net neutrality has to come into play to preserve the market. 
$C: I used to be a libertarian (or at least libertarian leaning) but things like this made me back out of it. I was libertarian on almost all issues, but then I saw a few things and decided government protection did more good than harm, because although I didn't trust government, I trusted big companies less (and still feel the same way.) At least with government I get to vote for the dumbasses who have authority over my life.

Slowly I started to think maybe more and more things would be better under government control because although I really don't trust government, I trust most private companies even less. Now I'm a borderline socialist, but I used to consider myself libertarian.
$C: HAHAHA

Ok so let's see how many companies want to invest hundreds and hundreds of millions in infrastructure to enter the marketplace....

*crickets*

Great. So let's deregulate everything and hope that there MIGHT be someone that does that.... How soon will they have all that infrastructure built to be able to compete and fix the market after it's all deregulated?

40 years you say?

Yeah the consumer won't mind getting ASSFUCKED for 40 years while the magical mystical unicorn powers of the free and completely unregulated market magically creates something that magically happens to be in their best interests.

**What a pile of horseshit.** These people are fucking idiots. The size and scale of these utilities is absolutely fucking enormous and the amount of time it would take to reach this conclusion (IF they're right, and that's a big IFFFF) is absolutely unacceptable.
$C: I think you don't understand libertarianism if you think any libertarian idea would be bolstered by federal regulation. 


$C: Depends on the approach to Libertarianism one takes, I guess. A purist take on Libertarianism is essentially opposed to any government regulation in the free market. This is Right-Libertarianism. In this particular case, Net Neutrality is a way for the government to tell individuals what they can or can't do with a certain resource, therein restricting individual liberties and running afoul of the philosophy. Taken to its extreme, you approach anarcho-capitalism where the free market determines all aspects of life.

Left-Libertarianism boiled down to its purist form is more like anarcho-socialism where the government is used to ensure that all individuals are guaranteed a fair playing field through the elimination of private (but not personal) resources. A more practical approach is to make sure that everyone gets to participate equally in the freest market possible. Left-Libertarians would support Net Neutrality because it ensures that a resource that should be public like the internet can be used equally by everyone and create a healthier free-ish market. 
$C: Libertarians are anti-regulation, regardless of if you think it will "increase competition."
$C: "Libertarians", "For" and "Regulation" are not words that appear in the same sentence.

They believe that an unregulated playing field is automatically fair and competitive. And that's why they're idiots.
$C: B-b-but, big government scary.  No taxes, no touchy me guns.  
$C: Then you don’t understand what “Libertarian” means. 
$C: That requires a governing body though, which is anathema. 
$C: Some people think that the government shouldn’t be regulating anything and that it should be a free market. Unfortunately, in the case of the monopoly these companies have, it’s not actually reasonable. I think most libertarians see that, but every party has its people who have no give in their thoughts. I see it because my only choice for an internet provider is Comcast. Thanks to that, they’re constantly jacking up rates and you have to constantly call and nag to bring them back down. I certainly don’t trust them to not mess with my ability to go where I need to on the web without my speed being affected. 
*edited for typos
$C: A world where it's brought by government regulation. 

I think there tends to be a sort of gradiant in what different people consider libertarian, but pretty much any kind of government interference whatsoever is protested by people on the deep end of libertarianism. 

[To the extent that apparently they have an annual gathering with a preference for paying in gold/silver over dollars from the Federal Reserve](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/06/28/534735727/episode-286-libertarian-summer-camp) among other things. 
$C: Too many people think voting for a smaller party means voting for them for president. It absolutely is throwing your vote away and the equivalent of voting for who you like the least. Smaller parties need to work on building up from local & state elections that are winnable, but they never make much effort there.

$C: There's a reason it's called a cult.  Be prepared for when they go full Jonestown, friend!  Because they'll try to take *us* with them.
$C: ^(does the R stand for team rocket?)
$C: Yet republicans were the only side willing to go against their party and vote against their parties goals
$C: [deleted]
$C: DEMOCRATS VOTE GOOD ON THIS. 
$C: Potentially.  But on mobile one has a hard time remembering how to italic
$C: which side are you even on
$C: The other issue with it is that there physically can't really be more competition just from an infrastructure perspective. There's a reason everything that requires pipes or lines run to every person's house is heavily regulated or municipal. It's not cost effective or reasonable for every company to run lines so there will never be true competition. Even with Google, it's basically just 2 options for broadband at most, plus shitty DSL or satellite. Other places *maybe* have Fios & Cable and Verizon seems to have stopped running new lines the last few years. Even in the best case scenario there will never be enough to drive the market price down.

$C: And now you know why Google Fiber isn't in NYC, because everyone would immediately switch over from the single shitty service provider.


These companies don't give up their position's easily. They pay off the local city governments to prevent new major infrastructure projects with red tape. Google may have a lot of money, but they're not in the business of just setting it on fire while waiting for approval.
$C: Since we know for a fact that several large telecoms companies hired “social outreach” firms to “influence the conversation” on net neutrality, and since we know what their talking points were, it’s very likely that if you ran into someone on Reddit spreading those talking points they were either a shill or had been convinced by one. 
$C: Either a shill/lobbyist or dumbass if they're against net neutrality.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I'm a law abiding citizen. I deserve my constitutional rights. 
$C: Right, but this is done extensively no matter what the issue is. The two party system is just awful. But as I said, I'm glad this went through. 
$C: I completely agree. But it's essentially what's happening here.

Our entire system needs to be reevaluated, but I am very glad this went through. 
$C: >Yeah, this is pretty accurate. 

Just irrelevant.
$C: Omfg... Abbott is a fucking joke.


$C: It isn't being rude. It's being emotionally forceful. There's a difference. It'd be rude if I said it to their face. ;) 
$C: I said ducking, does that look like a duck to you? I swear to god Karen.
$C: > You can find plenty of examples of what look like "evil" votes by the Democrats since many representatives care more about point-scoring than serving the public interest.

But apparently you can't bother to even show us one
$C: I would love to see an example or 30 cherry picked to show Republicans in the right and Dems obstructing. Since I've followed politics for the last 15 years I have routinely seen the Republicans vote against the public interest and vote in favor of their donors time and time again. Please keep examples to last 15 years.
$C: A mod on /r/TumblrInAction should certainly know about propaganda. That's all you do, after all.
$C: What I find bad with the US system is that it's in essence two party state there's no middle ground... 

For example all Dk, Fi, No, Se has 7-12 different parties in the government and where the smaller ones doesn't have much to say (they are basically sister/brother parties to the larger) they still both get support from the people and get some attention from the larger because without the smaller ones the large parties would loose voting... 

And the winds shift fast sometimes to follow what the people are currently angry over, ex: "Sverige demokraterna" (immigration critical party in Sweden) went from >3% votes in -06 and no seats to 5,7% in -10 and 12,9% in -14, witch means they went from no political power to +10% of the votes in government in 8 years... Just because the people didn't agree with the big current parties immigration policies.


One thing that's easier in those countries though is that it takes, at most, ~200k people voting for a party to get a seat in government and around 85% of all people votes... 
$C: In essence, what you're typing is propaganda. 
$C: Haha yup! 😂 
$C: The dream is the nanny state? Any backing or just your talking point of the day?
$C: Exactly. 
$C: No, you're simply being hyper partisan as usual. As I said, what dictates voting is the party who proposed legislation, not what the legislation itself actually is. That's the problem here.

Sure, if you define "good" as "what my party wants" then the other guys are just evil, but that's a simplistic and arrogant view of the world. You'll also find that Republican voters will see the Democrats as being evil in the same manner, thus making this a divisive attitude.

>  If you happen to dig long enough and find something to the contrary, THAT would be cherry picking.

The data is literally right there in the link for you to look at. You might also notice the about-turns in voting patterns when bills on the same issue are proposed on by different parties. Burying your head in the sand won't change that.
$C: >republicans are almost unanimous on saying fuck you to people's rights to [...] free speech

Uhh... what?

Edit: although I don't know why I'm acting surprised. Free Speech and War are the two big issues where the two parties *do* agree but pretend that they don't.
$C: Exactly.  I hate abortion but the pro-birth position Republicans have doesn't solve any problems.
$C: Something's up with the rendering on your browser. Perhaps trying a different one will fix it or reinstalling/updating the one you use. 
$C: "It makes us look bad!"

Stop fucking crying when the evidence is in front of you.

> whereas what you really see is both parties voting against all legislation

Show me an a damn example
$C: Do a list that proves this
$C: I disagree. There's a similar list floating around that *is* grossly misleading, but this one is pretty fair. With the exception of the last one (which was obviously added in later by some idiot), they all seem to be bills focused around the parts where the two parties openly disagree with each other.
$C: So are they supposed to just re-find all of the same stuff just to type it all over again? Seems like a waste of time to me.
$C: Yeah real shame the general public cares about that non issue more than anything else
$C: That's not what they said at all...
$C: She holds a ton of power being the one most likely to defect.  She's a crucial member of just about every "compromise caucus" that gets formed.  She's also been a Republican Senator for 21 years, so pure stubbornness probably has a lot to do with it.  Sort of a "hell if these idiots force me out of my own party" sentiment.
$C: Her voting record suggests she's more conservative than Joe Manchin, the most conservative Democrat in the Senate.  Also politicians who switch parties after winning an election typically just end up being hated by both ends of the political spectrum.
$C: Not really sure tbh lol
$C: If Maine is anything like Alaska, she'd never get re-elected. Murkowski has the same issues- she would fit better in an independent category, but too many sheep vote party on the ticket in Alaska, so she'd never hold her seat that way. Tea bagger assholes tried to get rid of her a couple elections ago and she had to claw her way back with write-ins and a shit ton of Dems in AK voting for her over because better her than the shitty tea bagger the assholes tried to shove in. 
$C: She's still a very conservative Republican. She's just not completely insane or completely corrupt.
$C: > They still broke party lines

they collaberated with the party.

gop knows when a vote is unpopular. they choose the select few to vote no so they can win reelection. they been seeding those no to both alaska and maine for awhile now.

only count breaking party lines when the vote win or they actually have a real history of it.

there are still so many more battles since the GOP really screwed over the country. Net Neutrallity is hardly a starting point.
$C: and collided with the GOP so the vote doesnt matter.

havnt you heard what i saying. GOP knew what their voting record.

they knew the vote was unpopular. They send these special vote to districts that need it for the midterm election. gop is afraid of losing both maine and alaska

i only count votes that actually matter like john mccain saving obamacare
$C: give me a party that’s supported by unions over one supported by the nra any day
$C: Because the Republicans were the overall less worse from their point of view? Just because someone votes for a party doesn't mean they entirely agree with said party.

This kind of absolute "with them or against them" attitude is precisely why there's so much political polarisation happening throughout the world.
$C: There are more red states than blue states, but way more people living in the blue states?

I know, numbers, math, and common sense is not your strong thing, but use that wrinkled blob floating in your skull cage.
$C: If you'll recall, they did vote in a democrat. Hillary won the popular vote. The electoral college apparently felt differently than the American people though.
$C: You do realize those are two different things, right?
$C: Republicans didn't win nearly as many votes as they won offices. What you really should be asking yourself is why one political party is winning more offices than they won votes.

>The now officially-certified votes from the 2016 presidential race show that Hillary Clinton surpassed Donald Trump in the national popular vote by nearly 2.9 million votes.

https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-officially-wins-popular-vote-29-million/story?id=44354341

>We can quantify the partisan bias of Congress over time by measuring the distance between each national presidential result and each year’s presidential result in the median House and Senate seats. So in 2008, for example, Barack Obama won the popular vote by 7.3 percentage points, but Democrats won the median House seat by 4.4 points — a pro-GOP bias of 2.9 points.
>In 2016, Trump lost the national popular vote by 2.1 percentage points, but Republicans won the median House seat by 3.4 points and the median Senate seat by 3.6 points — that’s the widest Senate gap in at least a century and tied with 2012 for the widest House disparity in the last half-century.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-congressional-map-is-historically-biased-toward-the-gop/

>First, while Republicans, as of this writing, received a plurality of votes cast for Congress nationwide this year—49.9 percent, again according data from the Cook Political Report—they received a greater share, 55.2 percent, of the seats.  Democrats, as a result, won a smaller share of seats than they did votes: 44.8 percent of seats as compared to 47.3 percent of the votes.

https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2016/11/22/gop-seats-bonus-in-congress/

>In results that are still preliminary, 45.2 million Americans cast a vote for a Democratic Senate candidate, while 39.3 million Americans voted for a Republican. (In the White House race, as of Thursday afternoon, Clinton had 60.1 million votes and Trump had 59.8 million.)

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/11/10/democrats-won-popular-vote-senate-too/93598998/

>Republican candidates received 49.13% of total votes cast in 2016 and won 55.4% of U.S. House seats. Comparatively, Democratic candidates received 48.03% of votes and won 44.6% of races.

It turns out republicans don't have a mandate and they never did, if one looks at the will of the citizens as a guide.
$C: They didn't. Republicans just gerrymander like you wouldn't believe.
$C: Most did vote democrat but the vote was split between many capable candidates rather than one incapable candidate. This is the flaw of first past the post voting.

I assure if [instant runoff voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) was in place and gerrymandering corrected with [algorithmic sorting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/06/03/this-computer-programmer-solved-gerrymandering-in-his-spare-time/?utm_term=.07a05e4fc174) "The Donald" would not be in power.
$C: bc of republicans other positions. on this position, republicans are favoring at&t bribes over the voice of the people tho
$C: their goal isn't to be right or wrong.  it's to sidetrack, dissuade, and subvert.  a troll is as a troll does.
$C: Fuck me for saying Democrats are bought? Pleasant of you to say 
$C: Me, being ignorant? Oh that's rich.

> not all Republicans are against Net Neutrality

It was literally just three fucking people

> especially not all Republican voters.

If that's the case, then stop fucking voting in these people.
$C: It's a philosophical difference; classic negative liberty vs positive liberty. You probably think that the less government restrictions exist on you, the freer you are. I think it's the government's role to impose some restrictions that allow citizens greater opportunities that they otherwise wouldn't have, and to me, that's actual freedom.

It'll be difficult, because a party is going to exist for people like me. So I can see how that'd be frustrating for you.

Also, dunno why you're getting downvotes. This discussion is as vanilla as you can get.
$C: Nah, the same guys who rage out because they want background checks or laws keeping mentally ill people from easily obtaining firearms would just move on to another topic. The 2a crowd isn't rationally approaching the issue trying to find a solution...it's knee jerk reacting to every possible law as TAKING MY GUNS MOLON LABE!!!!! 

Also the Venn diagram of the hardcore irrational 2a crowd and MAGA hat chuds is pretty damn similar. 

I own a gun and don't understand how irrational and angry gun owners get about basic shit like showing ID or any tiny inconvenience. 
$C: Right, the same tired both sides are bad argument to launder the fact that one party is consistently voting against the people m 
$C: Mississippi and Oklahoma. But apparently simply fitting under those categories doesn't necessarily make them good places to live. 
$C: Mississippi and Oklahoma. You'd think Florida wou would be included because of its low taxes, but nah. Expensive to live there for lots of other reasons.

I'm not American either, though. I'm sure others might have a different opinion. I don't have a problem if someone can show me that I'm wrong.

Edit: my girlfriend has informed me that, despite falling under all three categories, Mississippi is generally not considered a good state to live in. 
$C: I live in North Carolina, and I love it. Its capital area is continually ranked one of the best places to live, work, start a business, go to college, and to raise a family *in the nation*. Apple is building their second headquarters here, and we are a top contender for Amazon’s second headquarters. We have low taxes, low unemployment, and have maintained a budget surplus for the past several years. 

The land is beautiful. We have mountains, beaches, lakes, and islands filled with fantastic nature preserves.

In fact, *so* many people like our state, that we recently surpassed the threshold of more non-native people living  here than people who were born here. 

So yeah, I like living in my “backwards hillbilly” state. We must be doing something right with the massive amount of New Englanders and West Coasters that continue to move here in droves every single year.
$C: I have a college degree from my “backwards” state university and make an above average salary, thanks. The guns thing was just something off the top of my head that makes me like living in my state compared to a blue state. 
$C: No, but your state is. It takes more money from the federal government than it pays in taxes. Blue states, in most cases, support the red ones with "low taxes"

I live in a red state too, but I wish our state government would get their heads out of their asses and do something productive.
$C: >We are all still ~~Americans~~ __People__ that should work together

FTFY
$C: Except that's exactly what you're doing with your original comment.
$C: What's a pension? Millennial in Texas who has a great career, that's not a thing anymore so I've heard?
$C: As they shouldn't. They are fiscally irresponsible. 
$C: I think you can put them on the same levels. People value different things so there isn't an objective better or worse set of problems. What I wish is that people would stop identifying their state with it's political leaning. I live in Arkansas. It's a beautiful place with lots of great people both red and blue. Sure there is more red than blue, but why does that matter. Can't we identify by more than just politics? As a conservative who is friends with several hardcore Democrats I know we can.
$C: Your reasoning for why red states are worst is just opinion though and what your priorities are. That is exactly what my comment is talking about. You’re failing to recognize people can have different priorities of what matters and are simply saying ‘these are what are important, my opinion is the right one’
$C: This guy’s right, thank you. It’s my opinion. I also knew exactly what would happen when I posted that. 
$C: That’s the explanation I was looking for!

Makes total sense, thanks!
$C: The bigger question is, why the fuck does he care what’s good for “his” party at this point? After them turning a blind eye to the character assassination from the Bush camp and now lying down and getting fleas with Trump I would hope he’d be ready to kick the RNC to the curb. 
$C: Actually the governor would appoint someone in the interim.
$C: But he's not representing his constituents if he's not voting. They are effectively disenfranchised until he's replaced.
$C: Usually the governor of said state appoints vacant seats.
$C: If he is alive towards the end of this month, the GOP governor gets to appoint his replacement. If he leaves office before then, the governor will pick a replacement, then in November there will be a special election.

This is important because Arizona is already one of the few (as in it and Nevada) where Democrats stand a chance of gaining Senate seats.
$C: It is both. I agree, definitely not a nice way to go.
$C: uhm... IDK if you know or not, but cancer causes tumors. Jus' sayin'.

Edit to add: My wife reminded me that there are non-cancerous tumors. 
$C: He's from Arkansas. "Should of" and "ain't" are pretty much the standards.

edit: Source: I'm from Arkansas. Still use both at times.
$C: Wow, after awhile reading about him I am just so confused. He spent so much of his life trying to good but threw it all away to be a fucking creep, and then all that shit with the campaign donations right before he would have to report where they came from. How can people like this live with themselves.
$C: misinformation*

Miss Information is a sexy librarian. 
$C: Umm...yeah. That's exactly the point. Once people are educated in the issue they are overwhelmingly in favor of net neutrality.
$C: So everyone on here who think NN is a great idea are just company shills, or bots
$C: No. You're not.
$C: To be fair, r/conservative actually *does* have a rule that you have to be a conservative to post there. Or at least they used to have the rule, listed on the side of the page. \(Although with the reddit redesign, and may be somewhere else.\)

The last time I was over there they were bashing John Oliver for his segment on the Venezuelan crisis, and it was so very clear from their comments that they had not actually watched the video. 
$C: Because they -- like just about everyone else -- were convinced Trump had no chance to beat Hillary. 

Now that he's President it's all aboard the Trump Train
$C: A lot of people that consider themselves republican are anti-trump. Just because you're a conservative doesn't mean you agree with the  "all hail the emperor" mentality. 
$C: It's more along the lines that you don't understand what racism is.  


Just because you don't use the n word and have a black friend doesn't mean you are not racist. 
$C: Nha i think im spot on my russian friend
$C: I’m sorry what? Is mayonnaise a racial slur?

Side note: asking this question made me feel like Patrick in that marching band episode. 
$C: I am honestly confused. What is the racial slur?
$C: What racial slur?
$C: the “president” fucked her my nigga maybe she should be more important w her big ass ttties 
$C: The amount of bias any news organization has is up to the reader. Beat reporters, editorialists, and investigative journalists are all human. But why you'd watch/read something that you *know and accept is shittily biased* without a huge grain of salt, just because you perceive other organizations to be just as shittily biased in other ways, is beyond me.
$C: Wait. Trump uses the words "fail" and "failing" a lot. I'm suddenly suspicious of you. 
$C: Where is this list? 
$C: >how would you reply to a very long ~~list~~ gish gallop
$C: Show us the list!
$C: What you're doing here is called gish galloping. Try stating your opinion like a rational person and you will have more success.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I would say why focus on sources from the same side and not educated yourself with ideas from multiple sides to help make your own educated viewpoint. You know, instead of just talking about how bad the left or the right are. There is a lot of misinformation coming from both sides of the media and yet people always think it’s only the other side that has it all wrong.
$C: That neither side is perfect, and we are all just humans trying to move along to get along, but that at least they support global warming and net neutrality. 

I'd really love to see a comparison of the news stations to find out which is least biased and most accurate, unfortunately I don't have the time do to it. Since shit, if they are making things up I absolutely want them called out for it. 
$C: Everyone's afraid of Russia, China, terrorists, of homelessness and drugs and healthcare costs... but how can we solve any problems if we're too busy sharpening our knives and eyeing the throats of our neighbors?

Yep. That's the "enemy." The "enemy" puts their kids in the same school you do, pay the same bills as you, drive the same routes to work as you. They might jump paycheck to paycheck the same as you, too. But XYZ TV says they're out to get you. They want your blood, hiding behind every bush, ready to pounce on your rights.

Do you hate your "enemy" and everything they stand for? That's great, keep tuning in to see what they're up to. Want to know what your evil president just did today? That's wonderful, we have a report about that. Be ready. At any moment, the "enemy" will come for you and your entire way of life will change. Be the first to know on XYZ TV.

Keep fearwatching, keep hatewatching. Keep attacking your neighbors verbally and physically for pitiable, minor disagreements. Keep acting like the "enemy" are animalistic, knuckledragging monkeys. After all, the cyclical, perpetual state of violence and vitriol needs steady, regular oiling if it's going to remain profitable. The system needs good little tools like us to oil it. 

Or...

Recognize that there is only one side. America. Start treating your kinsmen the way you want to be treated. Realize you can disagree with them without treating them like they're monsters. You can acknowledge that they share your air, your roads, your neighborhoods, and that you need to get along with them. You can cooperate, show respect, and find compromise. The alternative is that spend so much time arguing that we do nothing but fail. Your choice.

You're a member of the same race of creatures and country that put a man on the moon. I like to think means you're capable of being smart enough to know what the correct choice is.
$C: might as well link /r/circlejerk too
$C: AskTrumpSupporters is garbage.  It’s run by Trump haters and gotcha questions.  There’s no real discussion happening 
$C: [deleted]
$C: lol it's been a long time since I've seen someone make themselves look like such a retard. I'm going to kick back and make a bag of popcorn. This is only gonna get better. Please do go on...
$C: Haha imagine actually thinking like this
$C: Go on, share the arguments against Net Neutrality.
$C: I think it's just a consequence of the times. Things keep getting in a more "us vs. them" type mentality. The left sees Trump as an awful person so the left news will talk about how awful he is. The right sees him as a great person so they will talk about how great he is. They just make more money that way.
$C: Agreed. Without Net Neutrality, it definitely seems like it will make it nearly impossible for new ISPs. I've long thought one of the weakest arguments for repealing Net Neutrality was that people have choice of ISP. No, no you really don't. 
$C: Haha yep I've been there before. I refuse to ever pick a side, I'll try to understand issues individually and vote for whoever currently represents my best interests. Talking politics can be vicious with anybody, especially when they refuse to open their mind.
$C: You could call either the enacting or the repeal internet freedom. Both could be argued to support a free internet, it just depends on how you look at it.

$C: It was a joke. But I have actually seen someone use the argument that because it's a regulation it need to go. Like they just saw the words "regulation" and "internet" and didn't bother reading into it. There's also the fact that people on both sides will agree with anything that their party leaders say
$C: Shhh, you're breaking our narrative. 
$C: Money. People stopped paying for news so now the news finds ways to pay for itself. By selling ad views and pushing covert agendas instead of delivering news.
$C: Mainly because they both just point at each other and go "Yeah! THEY'RE biased" so instead of the truth getting broadcast you have one station saying "this person is a hero!" And the other saying "this person is a menace!" 
$C: I mean, I certainly see the other side of this argument: People like Net Neutrality when you phrase it in terms of allowing free access to the whole internet and preventing favoritism, but... people are also going to love it when Net Neutrality dies and AT&T starts offering free Hulu with your cell phone data package. Consumers won't notice the back-end charges that Hulu is paying to AT&T for the promotion, they will just gripe about "*how slow Netflix is these days*" and switch their viewing habits accordingly.

That said, once you start to see the internet walled-off into fiefdoms, I think that people will get upset that they have to pay $5.00 more for the "[social media tier](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4252153/what-is-net-neutrality-isp-package-diagram.0.jpg)" and will demand action at both the federal and State level.  If I'm right, then this would go a long way toward restoring competition in a broken marketplace.  If I'm wrong, then maybe the vast majority of consumers just don't find Net Neutrality that valuable and the marketplace will have spoken.


$C: Its not really "making things worse" so much as it is just not hiding the fact that the government has been fucking us since ISPs first formed. Everyone will claim NN is some great victory and feel like we've accomplished something, but all it does is hide the actual problem of government sanctioned monopolies. I feel like Washington loves this. The people get a small 'victory' to focus on instead of the years of government abuse. Its like scooping water out of a bucket with a thimble while the government fills it with a hose. But at least we got our thimble, right?
$C: Good point. We should also have a depression for a few years to make our economy stronger or some shit. Because people will understand hardship and then things will work out.
$C: Hey, youngmasterwolf, just a quick heads-up:  
**buisness** is actually spelled **business**. You can remember it by **begins with busi-**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
$C: Yes, but these bigger services, Netflix for example, use up extremely large amounts of the ISPs bandwidth. Now the ISPs are going to make their money somewhere, but since they can't charge a company like Netflix more, the only other option is to charge more across the board for those purchasing their internet service. 
$C: It just seems to me that since the ISPs can't charge the bigger companies that are using massive amounts of bandwidth, those costs are then put onto those purchasing their internet service as a whole.
This cost is spread out over everyone though, so it benefits those who use the internet a lot and are getting Netflix/Spotify/etc at reduced costs but those who have the internet for basic needs are getting overcharged to compensate it would seem, no? 
$C: People aren't even 1/100th as concerned about monopolies as they are Title II. I don't see anti ISP monopoly spam on /r/all. But corporations like Reddit and Facebook want to keep Title II regs in place, and they control the content.
$C: Blaming any opinion you don’t like on Russian bots is just lazy and stupid. I for one researched NN and come to realize it needs to go, and I’m definitely not Russian, nor are other people in this thread who are against NN
$C: Me. 

Of course I don't know how they actually explained it, but I'm gonna guess it was biased. 
$C: I mean, you *are* being baited. Right now. Are you operating at some depth of irony that I don't understand, or do you not get what bait is?
$C: I agree that both sides shouldn't do it. However, lets be realistic and look at this thread. Which side is actually getting attacked for it and what side is being downvoted for having a dissenting opinion?

I also wasn't specifically about you. I was talking in general.
$C: Literally provided you with educating material and you don’t want it? Keep living in fantasy world lying liberal!
$C: No, I just like reminding liberals they they’re losers and will never achieve the levels of success republicans have.

$C: >But there is no sure way of knowing who were the 119 lawmakers who wanted to give a CHR a deficient budget

So I take it voting them out didn't work?
$C: Works the same as USA. Needs the approval of the Senate, Congress, and the President.
$C: It's a move to further the drug war that's currently going on. If you're a rich, well-known individual who uses drugs, you pass. But if even a small rumor spreads around that you're a drug pusher or user, you're dead. 54 minors (correct me if I'm wrong) have been killed so far without warning, and all police reports claim ridiculous circumstances such as a pregnant teenager holding a grenade, a student who was simply on his way home holding a gun, etc. so the police had "no choice" but to kill them.

Also our President has been bought by China. He's loyal to them now. He said he'd be happy to slaughter a million drug users just like Hitler slaughter millions of Jews but doesn't bat an eye at the drugs being shipped from China to the Philippines. 
$C: Shill, or Ajit Pai frantically white knighting himself from his Verizon phone while being chauffeured home from work?
$C: Except that the FCC’s net neutrality bill hasn’t been passed, which is why you’re still able to troll on reddit without bashing your head into your keyboard out of frustration due to slow internet
$C: This doesn't necessarily take into account how he would've voted in his recent absence, but otherwise [McCain has voted on the side of the President 83% of the time](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/).

Granted, that's low for a Republican, but it's significantly higher, by at least 35 points,  than either of the independents or any of the Democrats in office right now. 
$C: Not yet.
$C: Solid plan, reject something that %80 of Americans want with midterm elections on the horizon. If their plan is to lose. Democrats have been winning elections all over the country for months simply because of what Republicans have already done (and not done). 

So, worst case scenario we do this all again after mid terms.
$C: [deleted]
$C: "It only ends once. Everything before that is just progress."

Yeah, it's more likely than not this attempt fails. But just because we're probably going to fail is no excuse not to try. And after the failure, we'll keep going, failing louder and more emphatically than before. Etc., etc.

Defeatism is diametrically opposed to the human spirit.
$C: Please look into your crystal ball and tell us more about the future you seem to know so much about.
$C: The only thing sad and pathetic here is your pessimism. 

Edit- No you didn’t , everyone is just calling you out for being an immature troll. 
$C: What's sad and pathetic is seeing someone who doesn't see the point in fighting a losing battle try to convince other people to give up as well. If everyone had a defeatist attitude like you then things like the civil Rights movement and women's suffrage would never have happened. Just because a war is unwinnable doesn't mean you should stop fighting for what you believe in.
$C: You're neither a shill nor a bot. You're just stupid and being downvoted for it.
$C: May I ask how? We still have the whole game ahead of us.
$C: Trump still has to sign it.  If trump refuses to sign it, it requires 2/3 majority in both house and senate.  It like won't even get a vote in congress, and if it does they didn't even get 2/3 in senate.

$C: Because he's hospitalized.
$C: In this case it wouldn't have mattered anyway. He could have made it 53-47 or 52-48, but that doesn't change anything. While that would be a problem if everyone did it, everyone else *did* vote so that's a strictly hypothetical problem.
$C: I don't understand people who complain about having many options, and one option is really good and really useful, but costs more than other options.

...So what's your point? What's your complaint? I don't understand the issue here. 

It's like saying "there are many cars I could buy, but the fastest cars cost more!" 
$C: Oligolopoly.
$C: Just a small nitpick, but 5 down has almost no influence on how long it takes to upload a document, which is based on your upload speed. 
$C: > There are plenty of relatively populous areas where a single ISP has a monopoly.

That's a lie. 

If it's not a lie, name one place. One. One example, and I'll admit I am wrong. 

(And specific dorms or apartments don't count. Those dorms/apartments had multiple options, and chose one for their tenants to use.) 
$C: There's no cell service in Baltimore? I doubt that. 
$C: So Trump shouldn’t be able to change his mind on stuff? Seems like a double standard you have there. Oh that’s right, you have no standards. 
$C: He never changed his mind on DACA. He ended the executive order and told congress to figure it out. Just as Obama said needed to happen. Then he offer 1.8 million people amnesty and the democrats didn’t take it beacuase they don’t want to fund border security. 
$C: How is that flopping like a fish?
$C: Trump and the successes of the republican party just proved otherwise.

Welcome to modern democracy - government policies are decided by morons
$C: >People like that are too far gone.  Society can and will move on without them.

Society \*is\* them. They won 8 of the last 10 Congressional elections and are almost guaranteed to win again this year. They're America. The rest of us are an exception.
$C: I hope thats a hyperbole and you're not actually equating the Republican party as a whole as evil.
$C: Chasing someone out of the country because they said stuff you don't like?

Where have I heard that one before? Foeden? Broden? Joeden? Ah, right. 

I care a bit more about the actions of the politicians than some random fucko in a coffee shop.

$C: [deleted]
$C: This is false. The president can veto it.
$C: ... you can veto a bill if you're president. this isn't "vetoing an fcc regulation" its vetoing a bill like any other. 

did you guys skip social studies or what
$C: He will, though. Why wouldn't he? He's made it very clear in the past that he's against net neutrality. He's the one who put Ajit Pai in charge of the FCC in the first place.
$C: Who ever knows with Trump? But it's not entirely empty,  if it had died in the Senate that would be the end.  Now it has to go through the same process in the House,  and a lot of Reps are up for re-election in November.  Our government moves at the speed of snail so anything is possible.  The important thing is not to give up. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Oh I totally agree. I think this is often ignored in the online discussion of net neutrality -- I know a lot of conservative friends who honestly don't give a damn how their politicans vote on issues like net neutrality.
$C: Guess if you guys really want this, you need to become a single issue voter. It worked for the NRA. Look at how scared Washington is of them. 

Being consistent and uncompromising on your agenda is key. Your way or the high way. Anyone who voted against your agenda, vote them out without exception. 
$C: Thanks First past the post. Giving us 2 options to choose from.
$C: This is why primaries exist.  I'm sure there's going to be a slew of Republicans who run against incumbents and claim that they'll support net neutrality. 
$C: Which is ridiculous since NN involves actual legislation while abortion is purely a court issue and Supreme Court appointments are a very roundabout (and historically unsuccessful) way to progress the pro life agenda.
$C: Yes, because it certainly wasn’t by actual arguments, of which there were none. 
$C: that's just being a dick about word choices in order to argue an otherwise untenable position. in places like Guatemala that don't have NN, the Internet *functions*, but it's an anti-consumer pain in the ass that only serves to limit the free flow of information and access. we should be aiming a little higher here than real basic functionality; it should also be accessible, open, and available.

the same argument also effectively tries to downplay the fact that net neutrality was basically the law of the land before it was codified as a principle, and its existence is a big part of why the modern Internet is what it is. if we'd been divvying up the web AOL-style in the 1990s, none of us would be here.

basically, the whole thing is a retarded house of cards that you'd only try to argue if you were deliberately misunderstanding the issue. dude's a tool, and it's only a question of who's holding his handle.
$C: https://twitter.com/dril/status/134787490526658561?lang=en
$C: Basically they designed it that way so the south could keep slaves.  They didn't patch it when that question got solved unfortunately...
$C: Even more fucked up is it will fail in the House which specifically represent the people.  The Senate, which passed the bill, more or less represents the states.

Oh, the irony if this dies in the House.
$C: You’re right. We should all have an app on our phones that asks us what our vote is on each bill. Without this, it is not democracy tbh.
$C: The majority of the House doesn’t want it. If there were no rules in place that allowed the Speaker to reject floor votes for bills, then they’d have to hear every single bill that passed through the head of legislators. That would cause astronomical levels of gridlock. 
$C: How does your "democracy" like being a literal dictatorship?
$C: They are very interesting:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_petition#Uses_since_1985

If you look at the Usage section, it's interesting how much it has declined since anonymity of signers was removed.

With regards to DACA specifically, representatives have said "we're working on it" for years. Not even just DACA but immigration in general has been something that is desperately in need of an overhaul for years.
$C: Well, fuck that :(
$C: No I don’t. I’m not American 
$C: No I don’t. I’m not American 
$C: But what about the minority of people that want to ruin other people's lives so they can have a few extra bucks? Do you hate minorities?
$C: They're not fixing up those places so the rich and powerful can come in, scoop up properties, rehab them, and then either live, sell, or rent at a huge markup. Our government is strategically ignoring these (and other) places. 
$C: >Most Americans in general want Universal Healthcare

No they don't. They want health care for *themselves.*
$C: 
>Most of Flint wants clean water, most of Puerto Rico wants power, most of Rural America wants gainful employment, Most Americans in general want Universal Healthcare

Flint has had (at least by regulatory standards) clean water for a long time now. And don’t be so sure about number 4... 
$C: > Most Americans in general want Universal Healthcare

Yeah nah

Edit: Downvotes because Reddit can't handle criticism. Maybe link to me some polls without an absurd urban bias?

$C: Only poor people want universal healthcare 
$C: You can't have universal healthcare with low taxes.

$C: A surprise to be sure
$C: If you’re not with me, then you are my enemy
$C: Hello there!
$C: By label, conservatives are always the party that wishes to maintain the status quo. There's no prerequisite concerning *what* exactly that status quo is. When a party is in power long enough that their beliefs become the status quo, then they become the conservative faction. That does not mean that conservatives today have the same values as conservatives from a different time period with different politics.

Today's Republicans were the Democrats of yesteryear.
$C: That is not exclusive to majority rule.
$C: You joke, but I've found that there's a strong correlation between being a member of the Republican party and insisting that "the United States is a republic, not a democracy."
$C: You post at T_D. Whatever credibility you had is gone.
$C: You didn't know your country has checks and balances. Fuck me no wonder you're heading to a oligarchy.
$C: Holy shit, its almost as if our government has a system of checks and balances so no one becomes a dictator!
$C: It's how a lot of committees in government work, there will be always be one more majority party member. Not that Trumpanzees would ever understand how these things work.
$C: Exactly. The Obama supporters would literally cheer every single move he made and if the move turned out to be bad then it was the “Racist Republicans fault”. Tbh Obama supporters are the next closest thing to Kim jong un supporters. Brainless drones. 
$C: I have a degree in Creative Writing. I was drunk when I typed that, but upon review I don't see any errors worth correcting on an Internet forum statement directly addressing another person, just stylistically too many stop and start statements. 

And I don't pretend to be righteous, I am a just good person, I have no reason to hide it.
$C: That's fair. It's really hard to have proper discourse on Reddit anyway. 
$C: > No, seriously? What's the point of this long gambit you're running to transform America into the worst country in the world? 

Since when is advocating and wishing for a stronger economy, stronger border control, less unemployment, lower taxes, bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula, fewer business regulations, less government in general etc. something that would transform America into the worst country in the world?! Seriously. How delusional are you?

>  I just fundamentally don't understand people who don't value the good and beautiful things in the world. 

Very emotional and beautiful but at the same time vapid. It'd also be nice if you cared to name some of those and which are being threatened by a Trump presidency. Please do.

You'd save yourself a lot of time and grief if you just understood that Trump supporters and conservatives aren't out to destroy the US but to preserve and improve it. 

On a different note, the fact that you jump to "why do you hate America?" conclusion when confronted by a Trump supporter merely making a "President" correction shows just how much hatred YOU have inside you. So much for being the "tolerant" side right?
$C: Seems to have worked on you 😂
$C: He killed himself before the bombings ever happened afaik

It's sad on so many levels
$C: [It was a suicide.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Tripathi?wprov=sfla1) Not that we want to spread misinformation about this guy on Reddit, right? Right?
$C: It always makes me chuckle that so many can't comprehend that the saying implies the big picture. One party is horrible for X specific issues, the other is horrible for Y specific issues. They don't have to both be horrible on every exact same thing to both be shit overall.

Try to keep up.
$C: It's the only way honestly. There is no path to NN with Republicans controlling any branch of the government. 
$C: That’s not really true. Based on every indicator, the Democrats are clearly moderately favoured to win the House in November. The “map is bad” for the Senate argumsnt is kind of stupid. Red state Democrats aren’t presidential Democrats, and would definitely be vulnerable in a HRC midterm, but most will likely survive 2018 (one or two may lose if the races turn south, but Trump’s unprecedented unpopularity suggests that the Senate isn’t really off the table; NV and AZ should be decently easy to pickup, and TN could go D for Bredesden, who is a uniquely great candidate, which would leave room for one loss).

But yeah, a “blue wave” won’t solve the issue at all, because Trump won’t sign it either way.
$C: Whoops, you actually understand American politics. You're supposed to be celebrating this meaningless vote!
$C: The consumer is going to have the internet of 2015. Some screwing.
$C: An open internet means you and I and your mom and the doctors out in whatever hospital pay the same amount to use the internet, not whatever AT&T package is available today.

It’s not hard man. An open standard is one everyone experiences equally. The alternative is that I’m charged 20% more than my cousin cause I want to use social media.
$C: Open internet ensures that all websites are treated equally. Net neutraloty secures that.
$C: Thanks! I went to the march for our lives and the women’s march and both were pretty chill.  I recommend going to a protest for a cause you believe in so that you can experience it.
$C: > if people like me remain silent

edit: no exactly sure why so many people are [butthurt](/r/iambutthurt) when I point that the original letter is not "well written", and borderling insulting. 
$C: Although this is very biased information.
$C: Sadly, you got to admit, it works. It works very very well. The NRA has Washington’s knee bent. 

That seems to be how you get shit done in the US due to how your political system works - non-mandatory voting means only the most fanatic crazies bother to vote thus they get to make the laws. 
$C: Nope.
$C: [deleted]
$C: My guess is because it has Obama's name on it, Republicans want it gone. On the other side, I can imagine some Democrats wanting to keep it for pretty much the same reason. As is tradition in a 2-party system.
$C: And then you get shot by a dude that was also allowed to keep his guns. 
$C: Because democrats are soooo great with those themselves.
$C: Dont take out student loans, get job with insurance. You can learn a trade for free if you dont have the means to pay for a degree. Many careers pay for your degree. Many employers offer health insurance as a perk to attract better employees. I chose not to go to school because I couldn't afford it. Dont make me pay for everyone else to go to school.
$C: And thats where we disagree. 
$C: I don't mean to insinuate that it is intentional, but it is a byproduct.
$C: The point I was poorly getting across was that the cities are heavily slanted to vote democrat because they pander to the LCD, which happen to be either the poor, minorities, and/or anyone else that wants to support the two former options.

It is more so a mix of past democrats and republicans that created the system of keeping the poor poor and fucking over the education system so that the poor can't learn.  Those are the low informational people I had previously refered to.
$C: If the government wanted to crack down, the internet is literally first thing to go. Look at china, iran, turkey, etc all literally blocking portions of the internet they find inconvenient like facebook or twitter or etc.  It's something they can actually do even with an armed citizenry.
$C: I think my favorite thing is this idea that the government's tanks and military ordinance would be deterred by a couple of Fallout-fantasy-loving guys with rifles and shotguns.  There are countries in the Middle East where civilians are regularly armed to the teeth, relatively speaking (including RPGs FFS), and fuck-all it does for them when a powerful military wants to crack down.

That aspect of the 2nd amendment argument really hasn't aged well.  If you want to argue some "inalienable right" akin to free speech or whatever, have at it.
$C: can you explain that a bit better? obviously “politically correct” is extremely vague and changes as time goes on. the type of people that i see complaining about PC culture and ‘tha SJWS’ just tend to be edgy assholes who want to be hateful without being criticized
$C: [deleted]
$C: ...except for all the people that do, but yeah aside from them, no one
$C: On that point I won't disagree. I don't trust the Democrats much, but I'd rather them than the Republicans right now.
$C: Were Democrats acting in public interest when they voted down a bill that would allow the import of cheaper generic medicine from Canada?
$C: Easy. Immigration.

Canada is significantly more progressive than even the DNC and their  country's immigration laws are far stricter than America's. It's foolhardy to keep immigration as it stands when in the country's current state, a living wage is becoming harder to attain and automation is threatening to make it even more so. 
$C: Haha, that's fair enough, I'm just saying that he has signed in legislation that hasn't been only Republican. I dont think it'll go through the house either it's just fun to talk about hypotheticals.
$C: No, the 2/3rds vote happens after the Veto.
$C: No, but that wasn't the example.
$C: Ugh. Awful
$C: Yesn't
$C: [deleted]
$C: All of that is fairly well known Reddit history. I'm asking specifically about how this led to an officer being killed, as you claimed.
$C: Everything is partisan if you hate your opponent enough. 
$C: Are you kidding me? He tried many times but the Republican-controlled Senate and House shut him down constantly.
$C: Fair enough. I'll admit you have a point there. However, Trump is appointing a Torture advocate.

The thing is, no president is/ever will be perfect. Politics is a bumpy two-way road, you have to admit. You'll always have criticism, be it from the opposing party or your own.
$C: Keep telling yourself that. I'll save the explanations for people who actually matter and listen to others.
$C: The perfect is the enemy of the good.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Yes, agreed. I'm not using these anecdotes to prove anything about the world, other than how a particular group has reacted to them.

You seem like you understand that, so let me reframe these two cases to drive the point home.

1) Two men at Starbucks were not purchasing anything and were eventually asked to leave. They even had an opportunity to leave when the police arrived, and they still preferred to be arrested. They were warned, that is trespassing after the first warning. I think it kind of goes against Starbucks' image, but it's still totally reasonable when you're a business.

2) A man goes to the Cheesecake Factory to meet his girlfriend's family. They intend to eat there. He wears a MAGA hat, which seems a little silly when you're meeting your girlfriend's family, but more power to him. Cheesecake Factory staff crowd around him, yell at him, call him a stupid n****r, and threaten physical violence toward him until he leaves.

Which, do you think, should cause more outrage in people who claim to care about black people? In this world trespassing is not a crime, but wrongthink is. The anecdotes aren't the issue, the reactions to them are.
$C: Clearly "Net Neutrality" doesn't resolve that sort of concern because literally every social media site and media hosting platform was and is shadowbanning, demonitizing, and burying all right leaning thought.

The concern you're listing should already be handled by the FTC, as it was before the FCC rules a few years ago. Why would I trust Reddit, Facebook, Youtube, etc when they say that switching the authority on Net Neutrality back to the FCC is for "neutrality" when they've become entirely partisan?
$C: [deleted]
$C: Oh you know me and know what I do day to day? I protect the country. What do you do?
$C: You think you are being clever, but (minority) races are a protected class, Reddit users who do not like Reddit are not, nor is Reddit important for QOL. Highly irrational argument.
$C: You sound silly. 
$C: It's scattered all throughout the bill listed here https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/03/12/392544534/fcc-publishes-full-text-of-net-neutrality-rules

On page 43, they basically state they reserve the right to remove "bad users" aka those they don't agree with. 

How that constitutes as "Open Internet" is beyond me.

Idk though, maybe I'm reading that wrong but it just doesn't seem right to me
$C: Point me to the country with no such legislation where ISPs censor content constantly. There's dozens you can pick from, you're telling me in every single one of those countries ISPs are dying to censor random crap like youporn or Fox but the benevolant government is preventing it? 

Give me a break.

You said "14 years ago". That's only 2004. The internet was around way before that, was there rampant censorship? Not that I can remember. ISPs rushed to sell the internet to as many people as possible touting how much stuff you could do on there. 

The world that Net Neutrality pretends to combat had ample chance to exist and it never did, because it's not profitable to sell a shitty internet service with randomly slow and blocked websites. No one wants this product. Only governments enable this product, not companies.
$C: Just noticed your profile background is The Punisher logo with an American flag behind it... somehow, I'm not surprised in the least.
$C: I agree with you big time. I have tried to be open minded about this issue because everyone seems to pretend that it's nonpartisan (though it clearly isn't.) The real problem is that many people simply don't have many choices when considering an ISP. NN only addresses a symptom of that problem, and it does nothing to encourage the kind of competition that leads to growth and helps *everybody*.
$C: But isn't that just tighter regulation? You'd literally punishing the larger ones directly. NN preserves a more even playing field. Your proposition would be the government helping to choose the victor.
$C: I’d settle for allowing more competition, instead of the local monopolies ISPs have now.   
$C: You're a fucking moron, dude.  The rest of the world doesn't think like a 14 year old suburban white male.
$C: Well, I could be considered the one in three I guess. 

I’m personally not afraid to cancel it, but I don’t rely on it for income or anything. 

Edit: my only other option is satellite which absolutely sucks. It’s either that or DSL for me at a whopping 10mbps. 
$C: I get your idea, the free market doesn't work in situations like this where we have regional monopolies and anti-competitive practices. Also, I would say I have more confidence in concrete regulations than the vague assurance of the free market.
$C: That's an excellent point, but in order to accomplish even the tiniest fraction of the first part of that 'freeing' would absolutely require something the last two generations of Americans are utterly incapable of doing.
$C: If only you had more of an idea of what this entailed that what you read in that one comment.
$C: Quite.
$C: You're agreeing with me, just not realizing it.
$C: The FCC implemented NN in 2005. Link:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States

Who are these small ISPs who would be eliminated?

$C: How because it opens up possibilities to faster internet and technological advances so you have to pay more  I'm fine with it or without it again most of us lived in a time without net neutrality it's not the end of the world  shit wont really change to much.People need to stop making it seem like the end of the internet.

$C: The proposal of the new rules killed 3 small ISPs I worked with in 2015.

But it takes so much work to inform yourself, Reddit can't be bothered to read 83 pages of text.
$C: The FCC currently regulates radio towers. They tell the towers where they can build and how they can build them.   
  
They tell them how they can deliver the content (in terms of power output and stuff), and the content itself, including things like swearing on the radio.  
  
I believe the FCC is the perfect body to regulate utility poles (because utility poles are just another method to convey communications, just like radio towers). And the content they deliver, in the same fashion they regulate radio.    
  
Communication isn't limited to wireless. We have an entire body devoted to communication regulation, and you want the body in control of trade to deal with communication regulation when it comes to internet?
  
There was enough regulation -kinda (as in we had NN) always.   
But the ISP's went to court and said "hey, the FCC can't force us to be neutral", and the judge agreed, based on ISP's current classification.   
The judge said if you reclassified them, then the regulation that already existed, could be applied. That's what started this whole debacle.
$C: On r/nfl sub I said Aaron Rodgers were gay and the mods banned me for a week because I was insinuating it was an insult if he were actually gay. 
$C: No, you're just full of shit.

$C: Says a few more than that bud according to the negative mark next to your dumbass comment 
$C: Trumps current approval rating has been climbing to its highest while in office, he is currently at 40% approval with 55% disapproval.  This means he has a LOWER approval rating, and a HIGHER disapproval rating than Gerald Ford, Barack Obama, Both Bushes, Truman, Clinton, Carter, Nixon, Eisenhower, Johnson, and Kennedy.  That is almost 60 years of ratings and despite being at his highest point in office, Trump is still BY FAR the LEAST approved and MOST disapproved President in modern history.  This has been true every day he has been in office.

Yes you still honestly believe I am deluded for pointing out that Obama had higher approval ratings every day in office than Trump and rivaled Reagan by the end of his term.

Edit: You said Trumps approval rating is higher than Obamas ever was yet his highest single day approval was 45, with a cumulative that was less than 0 due to astronomically high disapproval ratings.  While Obamas AVERAGE was 47.9 with an average margin much higher than Trump.  Trump has literally only managed to have a positive margin of 1 single point (approval -disapproval) and currently sits at -15%, while Obama had a high margin of 56 and currently sits at 59.
$C: As a Muslim lesbian millenial trans-woman, Donald J. Trump AKA Drumpf is #NotMyPresident. I know personally 150 trans kids that have killed themselves after Klumpf was announced as the winner, and recently, my 8 year old two-spirit demi-daughter said "Mommy, when is Trump going to start putting us in gas chambers like the 60 million Jews!"
This is what Trump is doing to our kids. But it gets worse. As I was walking down the street yesterday, some whte mles came up to me and said,"Hey Mohammed, learn to keep your trucks on the road." They then chuckled softly and took off my hijab and then literally raped me with it in front of hundreds of people in broad daylight and no one cared!
America is racist, sexist, ableist, xenophobic, classist, religionist, and esoteric Neo-Nazi White Nationalist White Supremacist Pepeist. I watch "The Resistance" with Keith Olbermann and proudly stand with Hollywood actors, EDUCATED college students and professors, media journalists, Democrats, Libertarians, Greens, many Republicans, and the international community as we fight the overreaching massive Trumpian dicatatorship that has taken over our country.
So yeah, straight white cis males need to kms because strong, proud, independent women like me are the future and there's no changing it.

did you already know that?

do you care?

no, in a forum where the majority of people speak English, the difference of believe vs "beleive" is rarely noticed and everyone knows what it means despite the typo, the bot is dumb unnecessary and just doubles as a spellcheck to call people out when they could easily right click or look up words since they are both widely available and underlined for you when you type a sentence, not to mention it doesn't really ever fix grammar only spelling mistakes.
$C: Oh yeah, man! If there's one thing ISPs are known for, its good healthy competition and passing the benefits to the consumer. Fuck off.
$C: Sure. Shortly after the bittorrent thing I mentioned the FCC passed the Open Internet Order requiring that ISPs

1. be transparent about how they handle network congestion, 
2. prohibit blocking of traffic on wired networks, and 
3. outlaw unreasonable discrimination on those networks.

Verizon then sued the FCC saying that they don't have the authority to regulate broadband unless they are classified as a utility. In 2014 Verizon won the lawsuit. Later that year broadband was reclassified under Title II of the telecommunications act.

Verizon has argued in court that they must be classified as a utility for the FCC to have any jurisdiction over them. They won that argument, so it seems that we do need them under title II classification in order to prevent those sorts of things.

$C: It's Reddit I don't take anything that seriously here. 

I don't have to point out what's wrong in each individual statement, the guy claims that NN is no longer in place. He claims that led to his internet speed increase. The whole basis of his opinion, right there, is wrong.
$C: Lol, sure thing buddy. Good luck in your CS studies, you'll need it.
$C: I'm not aware of the FCC looking to Congress to see whether they should act before enforcing other laws.  I could maybe see Congress pressuring the FCC to NOT enforce something, but as far as just taking a cue from them - that doesn't seem to happen currently.

$C: Well, what posts do you see upvoted to the top constantly?

Progressive liberal stuff or Russian propaganda?
$C: You are obviously misinformed. The comment before yours is referring to the 13 indictments of Russian trolls as a result of the Mueller investigation. What rock do you live under?
$C: Let's look at both extremes. In China the government says block x site. And X site gets blocked. In Mexico you have to choose another ISP if you don't like the offerings of the one you have access to and get screwed if there is nothing else available.

$C: But FCC implemented Net Neutrality in 2005 tho
$C: 1 Most people don't have any others to switch to because of regional monopolies, plus they prevent new competion 

2 Refer to my original comment 
$C: And your response to the rest of my comment? Preventive regulation is only one line of it.
$C: So therefore not restricting user content will make competing harder somehow? They have plenty of reasons to have competition, problem is that it's way too big of a business to simply enter, with net neutrality or not. No large corporation would ever share their landlines with others (and in some countries the evil government is actually forcing them to do that), and building a network of their own is completely impossible for new players.
$C: I'm not saying it isn't broken, but the zeitgeist of Reddit is this insane push for giving FCC legal authority over ISP's is a terrible idea.
$C: It's not just about bandwidth, it's also about how data is handled as it moves across a network. There are multiple factors that contribute to how networks operate.

It is more beneficial for data applications than for applications that require low latency and low jitter, such as voice and real-time video. He explains that looking at the full spectrum of applications, including both those that are sensitive to network latency and those that are not, the IP suite isn't actually neutral.

Not to mention, setting up a network or supply chain such that it's able to handle the max theoretical demand at any given point is *incredibly* inefficient. You set it up for six sigma. 

$C: It's not just about speed.

Data isn't just data. What that data is for also matters because it affects how its handled as it moves through the network. Data applications that require higher prioritization should be paying for them, but right now those costs are spread across all users. Even if two things require the same bandwidth, the one that requires less prioritization should still cost less. If she's just using email, she shouldn't have to pay as much. 
$C: A rock is hurdling towards my face, I'm not gonna go "Well lets see if its better!"

$C: I agree, but it's not that simple. Having these consumer protection laws in place can improve our situation for the time being. Besides, the current people in charge of the FCC (3/5 of them) are far from interested in doing that. The government as it is is acting in the interests of the corporate lobbiests.
$C: It wasn't gone though, the repeal hasn't gone into effect yet.
$C: > But you can switch to a different ISP.

[That's not as feasible as it first appears.]( https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170706/07200737728/50-million-us-homes-cant-get-25-mbps-more-than-one-isp.shtml)

I do get where you're coming from. In a perfect world we'd have multiple separate fiber networks, or one unbundled network, with competing ISPs, but utilities simply don't work well with private owners. We've essentially tried to make it work, but we ended up with regional monopolies and infrastructure barriers in most regions that have stifled competition or made it unviable. This is not to mention things like apartments that often only have a single network leaving the vast majority of tenants with a single or if they're lucky two choices for Internet. Ideally mobile networks would help, but at 23 GB caps they've proven nearly worthless as a replacement to wired infrastructure.

Can we fix or unwrangle ISPs and make competition? Maybe, but getting rid of net neutrality only harms that goal. [Small ISPs have stood fast behind net neutrality](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/06/30-small-isps-urge-ajit-pai-to-preserve-title-ii-and-net-neutrality-rules/). If you want the details, it's because only large ISPs can leverage their customers against services for financial gains. Small ISPs cannot benefit from removing net neutrality guidelines.
$C: Just because someone voted republican doesn't mean they are for the repeal. It just doesn't work that way.

$C: Seems fair enough. Unfortunately, being a decent human being isn't a prerequisite for being a world leader.   They've all got skeletons in their closets.  Trump just leaves his door wide open for all to view.

I'm more suspicious of the people who tried to hide their intention than I am of someone who brazenly wears his (often misguided) views on their sleeve.

Trump is less than subtle, and not exactly capable of doing lasting damage to the country.  Bush was much worse I'm.  He started a war and lied to make it seem like it was for the best.
$C: 1. When you used that as an arguement as to why Reddit didn't do anything to help, you implied that most Reddit users are conservatives.

2. But most republicans voted for him. So I fail to see your point.

3. Yeah. Which means we aren't falling for it

4. So are most people on this site. That's why they were up in arms about net neutrality in the first place.

$C: No problem. Sorry for generalizing you. Most people that want TD banned post there. My bad!
$C: No
$C: You can go to other websites. But most people have one broadband provider, if that. It's access vs the platform. Not a difficult distinction.

The road can't keep you from going to Walmart, but Walmart can decide to kick you off their property for pestering their other customers
$C: (Yes, I deliberately used my own anecdote to balance yours. I'm aware I'm not representative.)

Again, these other avenues you say are better... what are they? Smaller ISPs are almost impossible to start up and the current ISPs attack them viciously with stupid lawsuits designed to delay and drain their funds. Without natural competition, there's just too much opportunity for corruption.
$C: Aha, you admit it!
$C: >Your provided article just backs up my side. 

you're obviously a shill. the article only gives examples of NN being violated. not that it is ineffective.

>What was the point of the 2015 rules if they didn't prevent T-mobile

I've already given you plenty of examples in the article about the exact behaviour the 2015 rules prevents. And I explained how zero rating may actually be prohibited under the rules, enforcement of the NN rules are not perfect. there is nothing more to discuss here. The existence of zero rating doesn't invalidate NN.

>requiring them to have such a large regulatory bureaucracy that new companies or potentials companies couldn't even afford to compete. 

ROFL what a load of horse shit, please point out the requirements in the [document](https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-15-24A1.pdf) that prevent small ISPs from competing.

$C: I read your comment just fine, it was two sentences. Several of those things came to fruition just fine and they were only stopped because they were caught (eg. Comcast and p2p).

We're both in agreement that new (and better) legislation is needed.
$C: >That's when they changed the definition, under the guise of equal speeds.it's like calling a bill that allows spying on its citizens the Patiriot Act, to make it seem good. 

What? Lol how the hell..i don't even know how to respond to this

Except for those who Verizon is their only option...take net neutrality away and competition is dead

Specifically:

>In the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), public utilities are often [natural monopolies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly) because the infrastructure required to produce and deliver a product such as electricity or water is very expensive to build and maintain. 

This can \(but not always\) include telecommunications as well.  If you don't have access to major cable providers then you usually only have one choice of DSL provider or have to go to satellite or cellular.
$C: Almost every munipality makes a deal with an ISP to grant a monopoly within their jurisdiction. This practice needs to end. The few places in the US where there are actually competing ISPs with reasonable service is because those municipalities didn't make such a deal.
$C: I gave you the facts and sorry but you are a dumbass. Grammer - seriously? Get a fucking clue dumbass.
$C: Yeah I have no problem with a conservative supporting net-neutrality; I think it’s prudent to look at issues like this individually rather than strictly following an ideology, but arguing for being champions of the free market and calling for regulation in the same argument is interesting. 
$C: Which is totally fine and reasonable. It just also doesn’t follow the traditional conservative value of limited government interference/regulation. Even if it’s in response to other legislation that is deemed unfair, conservative/limited government ideology would be for removing other regulation, not adding more. I’m not saying that’s the correct approach. I’m also certainly not saying that represents the Republican Party.

$C: Then Net Neutrality is less important to you, and you feel like your time is better spent on issues more dear to you. That’s fine! I encourage you to be as active in those causes as you are able. No one person can advocate for every cause they care about with the same enthusiasm - there’s simply too many. We have to rely on others to do the heavy lifting in areas where we cannot, and add our voices to their causes when it is appropriate.

Which is rather important when it comes to raising awareness for the other causes you mention. Gonna be pretty hard explaining food deserts to people in the Salad Bowl without a neutral and accessible communication platform.

But seriously, honey attracts more flies than vinegar, and a polite, concise letter or phone call won't anger the staffer who has to listen to/read your request enough that s/he ignores it.

Hi, I'm [Name] from  [City, ST], and I'm calling to ask that Congressman Curtis vote in favor of the recently passed Senate resolution that keeps the Net Neutrality regulations in place. A fair, free and open Internet is important to those who create content and those who consume it. This is a VERY important issue to me and others. Thank you for taking the time to hear my opinion.

Simple, quick and takes less time for the phone call than it did looking up his number the first time. If you don't like what's happening that affects you everyday, you have to do something about it. Register to vote. Educate yourself on the issues. And more importantly, vote!

It's still early days and she's young, but she's already as good as old reddit.
$C: Interestingly enough is that Yishan Wong stated when he was hired the deciding question of his interview was "Why did Digg fail?". Even back then Reddit was worried about history repeating itself, to no avail it seems.
$C: I mean, reddit is like 9 years old. It's not unexpected that they would want to make a profit from it and capitalize on their popularity. 

Reddit is *reletively* low in advertising and other such revenue sources, so they have to make it up somewhere. Either we pay or we are the product.

$C: yeah I should really pay more attention to how this crap works but sifting through the news today just makes me want to dig a big hole and live underground.

$C: hey I know the schoolhouse rock bill song and that's all I need.

$C: > You shouls know how your own fucking government passes laws.

The piece of shit in the White House doesn't.  
$C: I think you mean "not enough people are pathetic."
$C: Someone approves Hannity's talking points.
$C: Not only does Trump not know what “heuristics” means, he doesn’t know how to find out what it means.
$C: They have until January to vote on it, they could do it sooner.
$C: Funny how from my point of view you just described the left perfectly. Just replace "GOP" with "DEM", and "Fox" with "CNN". Its like everyone acts the same regardless of political persuasion. 

My state rep went from someone I admired to a slick lying snake after just two years in D.C. I always wonder if it's the type of person a public office attracts, or do they just become disconnected from their roots while playing political games?
$C: In a similar vein - excuse the pun - you can murder just one, but do it so the blood gushes out onto your screen.

It's a short-term solution, of course, because the blood ends up coming off through general use. If you want a reapplication, of course you can take the u/Mythril_Zombie route and murder another homeless person. 

However, there's a smarter option. Take your chosen donor back to your place (or somewhere else private), and impose upon him/her the sentence of "destruction for blood" as popularised by the Khmer Rouge at their Tuol Sleng torture and democide centre/fun house: tie him/her to a frame, stick tubes into the arteries in his/her ankles and just drain the blood into whatever receptacle you're employing for the purpose. You should be able to get the vast majority of the blood out thanks to the action of the heart and then simply gravity.

If you really get through a lot of blood - swiping on Tinder cleans the screen up PDQ - but have a few qualms about killing *at all*, you can follow the above process but stop the withdrawal after a pint or so: your homeless person will survive intact. If you like, you can keep them (in *Mad Max: Fury Road* style), taking blood regularly, and feeling pretty good about yourself that you've got them off the streets.
$C: lol Obama was stymied by Congress for both terms and baselessly accused of being a Muslim socialist but a 71 year old Jewish man who openly embraces democratic socialism is gonna fix things? 


Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for Bernie and democratic socialism, but you’re insane if you think he had a chance/would be anything but the lamest of ducks  if somehow elected President.
$C: Your vote in November 2016 doesn’t excuse the stupid things you say in May 2018, sorry pal.
$C: If you look historically at the length of Special Counsel investigations you will see that they last at least 2-4 years normally. So perhaps Mueller will still save us after all :)
$C: Too cynical, I'd say. 

1. No reason this has to be 8 years of Trump hell. Vote him, and all Republicans, out!

2. Mueller isn't taking especially long, these kinds of investigations are *supposed* to take a long time. Don't let bullshit Republican talking points fool you. Mueller is building an ironclad case and has already hit tons of people with indictments. Watergate took longer than this is taking.
$C: Ironically she was a bit more centrist, but then the popularity of Bernie's socialism forced her to adopt more socialist policies.
$C: Pepperidge Farm remembers!
$C: Do you understand voting demographics my dude
$C: Oh buzz off!

Don't you have bunch of unborn fetuses to save? 😮

Don't forget to hand out some NRA flyers while you are at it! 😉
$C: I don't have to imagine, and i agree with everything but your last comment. Trumpers are not akward around others, we know how to win, and aren't afraid of soyboi betas. 

Alphas don't give a rats ass what the betas think. 
And Trump IS the president, and will be until 2024. 
$C: There was a president that did it recently also, recall Obomba saying it about Fox News?
$C: TIL
$C: Does he have a core mission besides “give me money?”
$C: That's just a simple bit of 'evidence' - he's railed against Net Neutrality many times as an attack on Conservative media.
$C: > Given his inconsistent consistency, I’m not sure that means a lot.

And yet you argued that not vetoing bills in the past implies not vetoing them in the future. Oh, there you go again:

>  So far he has signed every single bill that has been placed in front of him.

Which is completely irrelevant, because he didn't proclaim ahead of time that he was against those bills.

> But you have to admit your evidence is lacking

You're the one who lacks evidence that Trump would not veto a net neutrality bill.

>don’t let your distrust and dislike of Trump effect your judgement.

Quite the ad hominem. And an absurd one; Trump *says* he opposes net neutrality, it would take distrust to think that he wouldn't veto it, and thinking that he would veto it has nothing to do with disliking him and everything to do with what he has said in the past. And the word is "affect".

$C: I dunno.  He seems pretty confident in what it’s going to be.
$C: I heard a guy say they are the best turds.  The greatest turds!  Turds that are going to be winning so much you wouldn't believe!
$C: Doesn't matter how polished the turd is, it's still a turd. Idiots just like that they can see their reflection.
$C: As a socialist it breaks my heart to read shit like this realizing just how out of touch folks on the far left are with the rest of our country.Don't hold your breath.  A working class revolution is not around the corner.  Not even close.  Waiting around for one might as well be political apathy and tantamount to doing absolutely nothing. 

In the meantime, if you actually give a shit and aren't just a hot bag of air and useless ideology you might want to consider participating in the electoral process because that's the only way you're going to be able to exert any sort of power that will help to minimize harm and at the very least push in the direction that will be most beneficial to working People.  Hint: One party is for universal healthcare, the other isn't.  One party is for Net Neutrality, the other isn't.  One party is pro union, the other isn't. 

There are a lot of angry people out here and we all want justice and change.  Roll up your sleeves and get out there.  Organize.  Help where you can.  Inject direct action into daily activity and protest.  Bring your radical analysis with you.  

But drop the ultra militant revolutionary bullshit at the door.  Drop the ideological purity.  Drop the \*\*it's either a Marxist Proletarian Revolution™ or I'm taking my ball home with me\*\* childish attitude.  Learn to compromise.
$C: We need to seize the means of production
$C: Damn...downvoted for a South Park reference...I'm sorry bud, I got you
$C: No but it's sick and it's barfing its fucking brains out. Hopefully we can vomit this shit out before it digests. That's the immune system at work, and America has one too. 
$C: And with it, voters who buck against the trend of their state (Red California voters, Blue Alabamian Voters) have no vote.
$C: Without the electoral college the voters of every single state are equal. Without the electoral college, the will of the voters nationwide is done. 

With the electoral college, the will of the electors (that have no legal requirement to vote for the person that won the state) is done. 
$C: >Without it, the smaller population states practically have no vote.

So tell me how it's fair that my vote only counts as three fifths a person all because I live in a major metropolitan area?
$C: Except one is just a regular dildo, and the other has spikes, is 10 feet long and made of actual still\-living bees. 
$C: Lol have you seen their presidential candidate? Calling them dummies is being nice 
$C: Ok fine so you are still ok with whatever is worse than a liquid dog turd? What would that be, a loaded shotgun to our collective heads with Putin's finger on the trigger?

$C: One poorly cited example gets more upvotes than the question. Good job reddit, you morons. 
$C: No doubt you're referring to the primary drama. Here is the extent of what the DNC did to disadvantage Bernie:

1. Schedule debates on busy nights.

That's it. That's all they did. Separately, Donna Brazile, who was then working for CNN, gave Hillary *one* obvious debate question.
$C: Unless I'm mistaken, 6 democrats is a minority of democrats, right? 

Like, maybe I'm wrong with the math on this one, but I believe 6 out of 49 is a a relatively small number. That would mean up to 87% of Democrats don't support a torturer, while 100% of Republican senators do support a torturer.

Would you rather support a party that consists of 87% ethical people, or 0% ethical people? 

There's something wrong with you if you blame Haskell's inevitable confirmation on the 6 democrats, and not on the fucking 51 Republicans.
$C: Lol
$C: >especially with their cozy relations with corporations

Republicans pushed through a tax bill that lowered taxes for rich people and corporations.

Republicans consistently vote against environmental protections in favor of oil drilling/pipelines.

Republicans (except a few) voted to keep the anti-consumer, pro-business rules the FCC came up with.

The only corporation democrats have a “cozy relationship” with is the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and viewers like you. Thank you. 
$C: You aren’t wrong. It’s why leftists in America vote Green and ultra-conservatives may vote Constitution or other radical parties. The Democratic Party is very similar to the GOP on many topics, but since they don’t disagree, they aren’t issues up for debate. For instance, take racial segregation in public places. Both parties have the same stance on that, so it’s not an issue. This leaves out those on the fringes. 

On the left it could be socialism and the right it could be racism. 
$C: Like the kind of stagnation you get when you fix markets to prop up obsolete industries like coal? Or to artificially limit competition like telecom trying to kill net neutrality?
$C: You wrote so much without really saying anything. 
$C: ~baby steps~ because America is afraid of Bernie Sanders

One is in the right direction. One is not.
$C: "True" libertarians don't even want the government to protect the border. [The official LP platform](https://www.lp.org/issues/immigration/) is for open borders and unrestricted immigration (as long as the people immigrating aren't violent). The LP is also pro undocumented immigrants and is against labeling them criminals. So pretty much the exact opposite of what the alt-right believes.

That's usually how you can spot actual libertarians vs the alt-right dudes who are just pretending to be libertarian because they're too ashamed to call themselves alt-right. Every time there's some pro open border post on the LP facebook page or anywhere they come out of the woodwork. If someone claims they're against illegal immigrants but they call themselves libertarian, chances are they might not actually be a libertarian. But then again, coordinating libertarians is like herding cats.
$C: Yeah, they completely miss that the self\-regulation only works where everyone is equal and has equal power and that over time wealth aggregates more wealth in the same hands causing a massive imbalance in power between members of the community. No matter how much you hate a guy, you can't exactly run him out of town if he has his own well\-armed crony crew and a tight leash on some sort of necessity.

To me, what they are advocating for seems to essentially be a return to a type of... we can't even call it a pre\-feudal society, it's more like what existed before there was any sort of formal society, that extended beyond your local group. They seem to want to go full circle and we all know how that plays out: Despots, wars, slavery and so on.

The other possible natural consequence is the simple return to a regulated society as groups establish their own regulatory frameworks and begin to collaborate on a larger and larger scale with other groups, thus simply establishing a new state.

As my law 101 professor would've put it: "There is no society without law and no law without society. Without society there is no law, without law no society." Every group ends up being self\-regulating and having a framework of laws, the libertarian wet\-dream is just a fantasy, it's less possible, due to human nature, than communism.
$C: I love how this idea seems to be predicted on a foundation of everyone being reasonable, sound of mind, above board individuals who will fucking murder you at the drop of a hat if you so much as think about ruining their little community. 

Like, the die has already been cast. Some people have existing money and power. Some do not. How in this system of theirs are the powerful and those without conscious going to be stopped from doing literally whatever they want?

What's that? Your precious old growth forest that you enjoy is sitting on a mineral deposit? Fuck your forest, I already have a mining crew and an army of trigger happy goons. Good luck rounding up a posse to stop a coordinated group with formally restricted military gear, bucko; The mining boss bought the company that makes that shit and outfitted all his dudes. You have a few guys from town who have a dozen rifles each. Hope your Kevlar vest can stop explosive suicide drones. 

And what's to stop underhanded tactics from dominating small business too? Sure the expensive local baker has competition, but I heard the other guy pads out their flour with chalk so he doesn't have to buy as much. What? Who told me that? I dunno, some guy on the street. How's he going to prove he doesn't once he's already losing business? The food safety inspector? Ha. Shouldn't have been less of a dick. 

Basically, there's a whole bunch of shitty criminal behaviour that the local good ol boys simply can't or won't do anything about.
$C: >  their argument is that the shitty people in society will get shoved out of it by those that want a good life

This is where it all falls apart.  The shitty people in society are the ones with all the money and running things.  They push anyone with decency and morals out so they can continue making money.  
$C: Holy shit this is the dumbest thing I've ever heard if true. A bunch of cocamainy ideas that sound nice, but principle and practice are two very different beasts.
$C: I thought true Lib-Ts believe in fully open borders? Like no visas or immigration system, come and go as you please.  During last presidential election, I thought Gary Johnson mentioned this which is the exact moment I knew I couldn't support him. 
$C: Even Smith wrote that a monopoly is one of the two instances the government has to be involved in regulating the economy. Yet, we dealt with monopolies years centuries later, and still have oligopolies, each of which have a large enough share of their markets that they can do whatever they want and be profitable. That really isn’t Smith’s ideal, but whenever someone suggests regulating these companies they’re labeled a socialist. 
$C: It doesn't just sound like anarchy, it is anarchy holy cow.

>a state of disorder due to absence or nonrecognition of authority.
$C: Then what do you call left wing libertarians?
$C: The irony of libertarians being authoritarian... In Europe, they are literally opposites.
$C: You vote with your money far more than you vote at the ballot box. Just saying. 
$C: So I get what your saying, but you kinda sucked at saying it. I think the real problem is local governments preventing the creation of new isps, and granting monopolies to the major ones. A lot of local governments won’t allow new companies access to utility polls etc. etc. There have been a lot of attempts at start ups over the years that we’re blocked because of this. 
$C: This is accurate. Although from my visits to /r/Libertarian I'm not sure they can agree on what libertarianism is, either.
$C: I’m fairly far from being a libertarian, but damn. Why is there so much hatred? People just must not want to move forward as a whole. 
$C: Libertarians are not for regulations.
$C: Lmao so freedom of speech is a government regulation? We the tax payers paid for the research that created the internet. Us having unaltered access to that internet is a natural born right as an American. 
$C: They can go right ahead.
$C: Can they hurry up, already?
$C: This was the rare exception though.  Typically it's the Republicans voting as a solid block, and the Democrats breaking ranks.  A huge majority of Republicans are for net neutrality, so we should have been able to peel off more than a few.
$C: Means jack shit
$C: [deleted]
$C: To be fair, neither was the word voters...
$C: I like the idea of net neutrality. But I don’t like what the government is doing under the guise of NN. I don’t like how laws were put in place to abuse title II utility holders and hold them hostage to comply. 

All I’m saying is to look a little deeper and try to figure out why. Sure there’s special interest groups that don’t want NN for other reasons. But most of the government officials that DO want it, want it for more  control and bigger gov. Most republicans don’t like this idea. So it’s no surprise they don’t support it. 

It’s more than just two sides. Like everything else it’s a lot more complex than a list of people with yes or no next to their names. Start looking at why and paying attention to other laws that let them leverage the idea of “free and open internet” to get what they want. 

Again, tell me this new NN bill protects people from this kind of stuff and I’ll back it. 

Also, NN never stopped companies from tiering (they just had to be up front about it) and it never covered mobile broadband. (Which got better and cheaper during the entire time)
$C:  There's one way to have more on the logistics issue and that's unbundling. Remember in the 56k days that you'd get AOL CDs nearly weekly and all these ISPs would be having ads? It's because phone lines being a utility meant they had to play nice so while you may have AT&T phone service you can have Juno as your ISP.

Supreme Court though has ruled that the cable companies are under no such necessity so Community ISP can't rent the ability to use the lines from AT&T
$C: The cable companies had the established infrastructure because of cable tv in the era when they were competing with satellite when the internet was only over phone lines. Then someone figured out how to put internet on cable. Of course back then there were a lot more cable companies and that certainly put the war on. It's not that they were the only companies to think to establish necessary infrastructure, it's that they are the ones that won the broadband wars, buying up the smaller companies and regions that they could.

As to why Google Fiber takes so long to spread, this is what it takes for them to do. They have to lay out wire, that means getting access to the utility poles that ISPs already do (so that's where big ISPs can currently stop new ones from coming in depending on local), as well as construction along public land to lay out the wire and build the buildings needed for connections.

Now that describes Kansas City where people pray for Google to select their neighborhood because while Comcast here is god tier compared to Comcast in other regions... well when I first moved here the free (yea, I know, free internet was wonderful, even if it wasn't the fast one) fiber my apartment complex I think had one hiccup the entire time I lived there vs later apartment I moved to that Google wasn't an option I was paying for yet about every other week I had to call them because it was down. Locals know about the ISP and are begging for them to show up. But go to St. Louis where they don't have it and don't have the local word going for it. Roommate and I are paying $70 a month for Googles 1000 Mbps upload/download. AT&T in STL for the same service is $80/mo promo period then price increases after a year. But in theoretical world, Google Fiber announces they're moving to St. Louis, even if they try to do it in secret, the plans when getting to the utility poles which affects AT&Ts wires would be a tip off that a new ISP is attempting to come in. So they can drop their price to 50-60/mo (or even moreso) operating at a loss in that region to make sure Google Fiber operates at a loss as well. Once Google realizes they can't establish a beach head and leaves, STL AT&T just jacks the prices back up at the end of everyone's promo period and enjoys being the king of fiber in that city.
$C: Because it’s incredibly expensive to set up that level of infrastructure and you don’t start gaining revenue from it until after most of your infrastructure is completed. Bonus, there’s a lot of red tape to go through to get even get approved to build that infrastructure, and going through all of that red tape requires lawyers and experts (aka more money). The companies that are there now are almost all there because they already had similar infrastructure (phone or cable tv) making the infrastructure cheaper to build, and easier for them to get through the red tape.

My understanding of the Google Fiber situation is that Google is really only doing it as a secondary or even tertiary thing. They’re not putting much of their weight behind the project. I could be wrong about this part, it’s just what I’ve learned from reddit comments over the years, not from a legitimate credible source. Also the reason Google was able to enter the market is late is basically by slowly brute forcing their way into limited areas with their massive pile of cash. 

For an example of an actually competitive model for ISPs, look to what many other countries do where the infrastructure is publicly owned and leased to ISPs. This dramatically reduces the friction around new ISP entering the game and allows for legitimate competition between ISPs. 
$C: Soros funded the other side. 

Also, Obama hid some legislation in a military budget passed on Christmas Eve that allows the White House to use NN title ii requirements to force ISPs to spy on you, revoke your access, or block specific sites entirely if they don’t like them. Sounds crazy, right?

IF this new NN bill has protection against all thisnin place, then ill back it.

Until then, there’s this. (corrections welcome)

Actual bill: http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20161128/CRPT-114HRPT-S2943.pdf

Section passed:
https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2692/text

This establishes a “Center” as the white house, appointed by the white house, and controlled from within the white house with little to no oversight. This center grants fed to control the title ii license that Net netrality requires broadband providers to hold to operate and suspend if they dont comply. Will they? Who knows but this makes it legal and explains what they can and will do in detail. What’s not detailed is the definitions of what they deem an issue. Regardless, no one should have that power.

——copy pasta—— The file is titled National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, 

"He waited until Christmas Eve and hid it inside of the 3,000 page annual military budget so nobody would notice it." 

"Ohhhh shit yeah this is that fuckin propaganda thing that Obama legalized" "So you've already read through it?" "Jesus Christ." 

The lawyer flips through the 3,076 pages of the NDAA to page 1,396 (or 1,438 in pdf format). 

SEC. 1287. GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT CENTER. "This is so much more than just propaganda. Look at the original draft of the legislation."

>Identifying current and emerging trends in foreign propaganda and disinformation, including the use of print, broadcast, online and social media, support for third-party outlets such as think tanks, political parties, and nongovernmental organizations, and the use of covert or clandestine special operators and agents to influence targeted populations and governments in order to coordinate and shape the development of tactics, techniques, and procedures to expose and refute foreign misinformation and disinformation

The legislation establishes a fund to help train local journalists...

>Second, the legislation seeks to leverage expertise from outside government... provide grants and contracts to NGOs, civil society organizations, think tanks, private sector companies, media organizations, and other experts outside the U.S. government...

"They call in their globalist friends from some "totally neutral third-party" and together they can call anyone a propagandist. 

They can go after literally anybody who's been flagged by a third-party "fact-checker" without having to take them to court. " "Oh fuck”
"It's brilliant, really. 

They control the fact-checkers, the enforcers, and with the passage of Title II, the infrastructure to utilize them. Once a propagandist has been targeted, the President can use absolutely anything in the government to stop them."

>The Center will develop, integrate, and synchronize whole-of-government initiatives to expose and counter foreign disinformation operations...

And that's it ladies and gentlemen. That's why passing Net Neutrality is so important. The President uses the "whole-of-government" to suppress information. Thanks to Net Neutrality's Title II, they can order all ISPs to take down hostile information and any websites that distribute it. If the ISP refuses, their Title II Broadcasting License is legally revoked, they can no longer do business, they go bankrupt, and the government inherits their infrastructure. The government can integrate into the ISPs to censor anything, anywhere, at anytime. The ISPs are forced to obey.

STORY TIME IS OVER THIS IS ACTUALLY REAL
Are you imagining how real this is? They can physically shut down your access to the internet without a court order! Just because someone called you a propagandist! Just because you shitpost. 

They can take down Fox News, Drudge Report, Breitbart, 4chan, Voat, and any other website that pops up to replace it! They would have done this slowly, over the course of years, like they always do, so that nobody would notice until it's too late! They could've taken us down one buy one, year by year, and quietly suppress any online reactions! 

And it was 100% legal! They passed every law they needed to do it! Will they? Who knows but, it was legal and passed as law


AND NOW ONE FINAL QUOTE:

>p.1446 - "The Center shall terminate on the date that is 8 years after the date of the enactment of this Act."

They thought she would win.
$C: No, I don't. Please source that claim. 

Second, who are "they" that don't know enough about guns to regulate them? Democrat lawmakers, voters, or both? 

2.5, if no one can draw the line on the difference between weapon systems then how can you? 

Lastly, who do you think is qualified to "mess around" with the constitution? Constitutional amendments require two thirds of Congress or state approval. It's worth noting that republicans control a majority of both houses in Congress and over 30 states. Republican powers have led to how many mass shooting deaths this year? A few dozen, at least. In contrast, all of the guns in the entire United States led to approximately 0 instances of defending against tyranny, this year or *ever* that I'm aware of. 

Please, tell me again how important it is to keep "these people" away from the constitution. 
$C: Makes me glad that you wouldn't be law abiding and it is not a constitutional right in my country.
$C: Right, R's extensively vote against laws that will benefit their constituents, and people like you try to minimize it with this "Both parties are the same" garbage

https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6pc5qu/democrats_propose_rules_to_break_up_broadband/dkon8t4/ 

Campaign finance reform, Net Neutrality, financial protections, health care, regulations preventing another economic crash, employee protections....I could go on and on, but R's vote hard against their constituents every time. There are two parties, one of them which is actively trying to fuck their constituents. Pretending they're in any way similar is completely dishonest and generally done by people who want to try to keep the narrative about the really terrible party positive. 
$C: Until we abolish FPTP and install ranked voting we will be stuck with two parties.  Lessor of two evils buddy.
$C: The fact that Congress members vote along party lines is an incredibly relevant issue though?
$C: So by your logic, Trump wasn't being rude when he called haiti a shithole?
$C: > does that look like a duck to you?

Ducks and chickens are the same thing right?
$C: I did see some of his earlier examples, and he either didn't read them or they were easily refuted.
$C: By all means see my other comments. I did provide some earlier.
$C: Sadly I don't care enough to construct such a list, I've just been pointing out bias. Perhaps go and ask The_Donald.
$C: > Shit I've got no counterargument, better dig through this user's post history, that'll show them!

How pathetic.
$C: In which encouraging people to look at the raw data is apparently propaganda... That's a reach and a half.
$C: Socialism or communism is basically a nanny state. That is what Democrats want.
$C: You assume there are 2 sides to things like human rights.   It's not a political ideology and not up for fucking negotiation.  You're trying to paint it as a partisan bickering, but it's not.  Republicans are batshit insane, corrupt to the core, and don't give a single fuck what is good for the country so long as they keep their rich and cushy lifestyle.
$C: Weird. I'm running latest Chrome
$C: > "It makes us look bad!"

> Stop fucking crying when the evidence is in front of you.

I've explained elsewhere that this list is being cherry picked with an agenda to push. Here's a [full list of votes](https://votesmart.org/bills/NA/2018/) which you can check yourself.

> Show me an a damn example

Ok. Last year there was a vote restricting sales of US aircraft to Iran. [For some reason the Democrats opposed this](https://votesmart.org/bill/24317/62168/strengthening-oversight-of-irans-access-to-finance-act).

There was also legislation to allow deportation of migrants who belong to illegal gangs, [which again was opposed](https://votesmart.org/bill/23547/61030/criminal-alien-gang-member-removal-act).

For some reason [drought relief legislation](https://votesmart.org/bill/23422/60436/gaining-responsibility-on-water-act) was also an issue.

Anyone caring enough to push their agenda would readily be able to produce a similar list going whichever way they want. I'm not concerned with arguing the finer points of each bill, the issue is that posts like the OP's are misleading and function as propaganda rather than an honest representation of the problems with the US government.


$C: See below. Not being in the US or a Republican I've little motivation to produce a similar list, but the examples I've provided should be enough to demonstrate that such a list would be trivial to make.
$C: I misread it, yeah, my bad. 
$C: I can admire that level of stubbornness 
$C: The [twitter comments](https://twitter.com/SenatorCollins/status/996866503017418763) to her announcement are ... disheartening
$C: The party does oftentimes collaborates on stuff like this, but the reason I’m not convinced that was the case with the Devos vote is that Murkowski and Collins are known to be centrist republicans. Due to this, it’s not inconceivable that voting against Devos was genuinely within their principles, party scheming or not. Plus, Murkowski‘s last election was in 2016 and Collins was in 2014. If they were trying to save themselves for the midterms, why not have a senator up for re-election in 2018 and/or in more competitive state vote no? 
$C: personal Preference based on values? Say it ain’t so. It’s almost as if throwing the words “Nazi” and “baby killer” don’t propel our nation forward 
$C: Way to whataboutism, nobody is talking about the presidency yet you decided to talk about it since it fits your argument better. And FYI I'm not a T_D shill, both parties are corrupt as fuck and so is the entire system of state control we call the free country of America.
$C: [deleted]
$C: >It was literally just three fucking people

So it's not ALL of them, exactly what I said. Once again, majority=/=all

>If that's the case, then stop fucking voting in these people.

I'm not an American citizen, so I most definitely won't.
$C: You're painting with a very broad brush there. In fact, you're just kicking over the bucket and yelling at the paint.

You honestly believe that there is not a single person who believes that lawful citizens should have few restrictions on ownership, but also support measures that effectively target dangerous felons and the mentally ill? If so, then I must be a non-person. I see background checks as a necessary evil, when used correctly and effectively. Restrictions on violent criminals and those with dangerous mental illnesses make sense. Restrictions based on movie magic on a device that reduces hearing damage does not. Making overnight felons based on the ergonomic features of something they already own does not. 

All that said, as long as the Democratic Party keeps pushing progressively restrictive measures, especially ones that directly impact those who have harmed nobody (blanket bans of entire categories of firearms or accessories, written by people who don't understand them, for example), they will receive pushback from people who may support them in other ways.
$C: OKC born and raised. It’s honestly a decent place to live depending on your circumstances though you could say that about anywhere. And the people are generally friendly and courteous, although once you start talking to them a good majority will have some crazy views on things. It can be pretty off putting when everyone assumes you’re a gun toting republican just because you’re a white dude in the south. A lot of people will open up to me with their weird views thinking I’ll be like “oh yeah, the Mexicans ARE buying up all the houses from the white people..” 

Which is off topic but apparently gentrification is only good when white people do it 

Edit: typo
$C: No, I agree that isn't isn't all it takes.  That said, I did enjoy living in rural Oklahoma for many years with the exception of a less than stellar education. Not perfect by any means, but enjoyable if you like rural life. 


$C: Nope. North Carolina. 
$C: It was your third point about quality of life in your state. That speaks volumes.
$C: If people are fiscally irresponsible, it is because they haven’t been educated about it. Pensions are complicated for a lot of people. 

The easiest way to provide everyone with a pension is to force it. I.e. tax goes to state pension and 401k is opt out. 

$C: When I lived in the US, I didn’t hear many people talk about states as colours. It came up every now and again, but it was obvious to me without that. 

I lived in Austin, TX. So a blue city in red state. 

One thing I did note is that empathy is directly correlated with how you vote. Blue is more empathetic, and Europe is more empathetic in general than Democrats. Not saying it’s better, just an observation. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Hey I get it. I have a buddy who lives in super heavy blue and I come from a super heavy red area and we argue all the time because our hatred of the local politics has built our views. I have very little doubt that if we swapped where we would be arguing for the other side. I've always been on the front of extremes of either side are wrong, I swear my dad's tombstone is going to say "Somewhere in the middle lies the truth" because of how much he says that, but nowadays the extremes are the only choices we have.
$C: An equally valid point that I agree with. I was kind of playing devil's advocate. I'm sure he will not last much longer though. He looked pretty bad at the Comey hearing.
$C: Interesting. TIL. So it would be in the GOP's favor to have him live another 15 days?
$C: Not all tumors are cancerous. There is a difference. His type is cancerous and aggressive. 
$C: Hey, Rovden, just a quick heads-up:  
**should of** is actually spelled **should have**. You can remember it by **should have sounds like should of, but it just isn't right**.  
Have a nice day!

$C: Just making a joke 
$C: >How can people like this live with themselves

[Probably a lot like this.](https://i.imgur.com/RsI9t.gif)
$C: Well that awakened something.....
$C: Actually she ran an alternative medicine shop in South Park.
$C: Ah, a N.E.R.D.S connoisseur like myself...
$C: > So they initially voted against simply because they didn't understand it so they just knocked it down?  
  
We're discussing Senators voting. The survey in the quote had nothing to do with Senators.  
So, when you say, "actively misled by corporate interests." it's ironic that you, yourself, have been misled.
$C: Or they think that people are being "actively mislead" by a different set of corporate interests.
$C: No, there's no such rule... at least stated anywhere.  When I first posted there, I asked if I was allowed to post there despite not being conservative.  I was told it was fine as long as I behave myself.

In retrospect, this was naive of me to believe.  I mean, read this actual quote from why they decided on their mission statement:
> In fact, conservative ideas thrive when contrasted with the vapid superficiality, pseudo intellectualism, and creepy totalitarianism of leftism.

That's not a post from someone with a balanced viewpoint or who is looking for truth.  There are some reasonable people in the sub, I had a few great discussions.  There are also quite a few rabid idiots, including at least one mod... and they certainly don't hold the articles that get posted to any sort of quality standards.

In short: it's an echo chamber.
$C: ... right. Which is why it's surprising that /r/conservative, which was previously anti-trump, is now the_donald lite. Try to keep up.
$C: Since when was there a all hail the emperor mentality about trump we just agree with him on how our country should be run
$C: >It's more along the lines that you don't understand what racism is. 

"I decide what defines racism, and this week it's everyone with a different opinion to me."
$C: What an oversimplification and newspeakian way of equating Libertarians with racists. 
$C: Horseradish isn't a racial slur either.
$C: something something white christian males are so oppressed!! 
$C: I'm middle eastern, white people don't like when I call them white people and drink their beer at the same time. 
$C: Mayonnaise, referring to the pale complexion of white people. Think of it like if someone said something like "The Chocolate News network can be so entertaining"

Clearly not okay, and it's dismissive.
$C: What I'm saying is that they're losing bigly.
$C: That's the thing - They get to throw around accusations that they've heard their chosen "News" station squawk repeatedly over the last two years without actually bothering to dig into the claims.  It's in the Fox News Bill of Rights.
$C: I will not, I've seen countless mild mannered comments in here that at the slightest inkling of the person in question not being on the right side of this thread get battering rammed with downvotes and vitriol. I've been here a while, I know how this goes and none of this is unexpected.

$C: Oof
$C: Read both of my comments. I am basically saying they are two sides of the same coin, in response to someone who believes it's fox on both sides.
$C: I'm saving this. Thank you.
$C: /r/circlejerk 

No but seriously, I don't know what you're getting at. I've generally seen a healthy back-and-forth on those subs.
$C: I was really hoping I finally found a civilized corner of the internet regarding polarizing topics. The search continues...
$C: 300lb "body builder" in perpetual bulking stage 
$C: You say that like I don't know. 
$C: Haha imagine crawling through my user profile because you're butthurt you got called out in a completely different thread
$C: Netflix should have to pay for the internet they use, not just the consumer.
An isp should not have to get their expansion or business plans approved by the fcc, let tem do whatever then get the FTC involved if they do something unscrupulous. (This is actually what pai did, passed the responsibility to the FTC.)
$C: You've just made my point. Too many people only know either the pros, OR the cons.

John Stuart Mills said it best: "He who knows only his own side of the case, knows little of that."
$C: Agreed, it’s a shame that all this “he will not divide us” just because us dividing us. I mean, I see some hate people throw around on social media and it’s a war of words.

It’s just like Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, and everyone is  fighting about which level our nation is at, and what they need to do to move up.
$C: Can’t upvote enough
$C: I’m from NYC, which is predominantly Dem, buy my specific section is known for being Rep.

So, talking politics with anyone around here is a mine field lol It has become so common-place now where before it was a rarity!

Side note: This past mayoral election they gave us material in the mail with each candidate, who they were, their qualifications, and all their positions. By far the best thing I’ve seen for elections, because everything on the internet is through a filter. Here it was just down to the meat of things.
$C: Thanks, here's a slice for you 🍰
$C: Maybe read the question before you copy-paste.
$C: I have a friend that's like that. Basically anything that's government regulated is bad. 

Funny part is, he's never lived on his own or paid his own bills or even has a job (mid 20s) and yet is strong republican and pro corporation. Ironic. 
$C: Not really though.
$C: So you want to make the internet as shitty as possible and hope people getting mad is enough for politicians to stop taking money from big Telecom companies? It's a bold move cotton! 
$C: Damn bro, this is the first reasonable argument I've heard against Net Neutrality. Well done.

I disagree ideologically with making things worse to make them better with regards to public policy, so I disagree with you. But I for sure get what you're saying.
$C: That definitely wasn't my point. Get cancer.  
$C: Companies already pay for what they use. Netflix pays far more for their traffic than some small startup. Perhaps the amount per gigabyte are really close, but since Netflix gets magnitudes more traffic they pay more. But they both pay the same for the same amount. Without net neutrality you would be in a situation where companies would pay different amounts for the same traffic. 

This is incredibly dangerous for startups. What if they can’t pay for some kind of premium access fast lane? Who wants to use a company’s site if it runs slow? This has the potential to crush small businesses and startups before they can get off the ground. 

Edit: btw I do appreciate you making an effort to read into it more. It’s a huge deal and will have far reaching implications for the future. 
$C: >People aren't even 1/100th as concerned about monopolies as they are Title II.

Because keeping Title II is a lot more realistic a goal than unwinding a monopoly that's been decades in the making.
$C: or that's just what you want us to think
$C: "I don't know how they actually explained it"

Well then shut up 😂
$C: My understanding of irony reaches the level of forbidden Lovecraftian knowledge
$C: He just thinks that he’s supposed to reply that way and he instantly wins, but any reply makes me win so it’s extra spicy. 
$C: Its the unfortunate tenancy of Reddit to downvote what people don't like. Ive seen both sides downvoting the other, but you're right in saying the anti-NN crowd is being downvoted most.
$C: I know but I don't see him coming back to senate. 
$C: Dude look who fuckin' voted against it. Only republicans. Voting against the interest of their constituents is their whole ideology and they get elected. Trump has pretty much spent his entire presidency doing the wrong thing and he's still popular with conservatives. He nixed the Paris Accords, he nixed the Iran Nuclear Deal, he rewrote the tax code to make billionaires richer at our expense, and he refuses to do anything about gun violence after a series of brutal massacres. He doesn't give a fuck because he doesn't have to. Uneducated hicks and racist ideologues love him and they will outnumber the disillusioned people who don't like Trump at the polls.
$C: > reject something that &#37;80 of Americans 

Were did you get those figures?
$C: Imagine if Trump vetoes a net neutrality bill and Congress doesn't have the votes to override. Reddit will literally lose its shit.
$C: I didn’t know understanding where congresspeople and the president stand in an issue is regarded as telling the future 
$C: Odd way to spell being realistic. Congress isn’t passing this, nor is the president signing it. You don’t have 2/3 majority vote in congress and senate to override the veto. It’s cute that you’re optimistic, but you’re still a loser by all definitions
$C: You don’t, at least for this bill that was passed, congress for sure won’t pass it, and President for sure ain’t singing it. If you were to override the presidential veto you need 2/3 majority house and senate vote. You don’t have 2/3 majority senate vote. Game over. 
$C: Hmm, this victory is still a good thing. It raises awareness and means that at the next election net neutrality will be a talking point. Shows that America cares.
$C: While that's terrible and sad to hear, I wonder who is speaking for his people?

His terminal illness leaves his constituents without a voice.

A shitty circumstance all around.
$C: i just meant why is he always absent

$C: Holy shit, it’s not about cars being faster than others (in your shit analogy).. it’s the internet, free speech. Inalienable rights to broadcast, no matter if you’re Amazon or that guy next door in his garage who deemed college a waste of money. But I digress.

The internet is a public utility, it’s awesome power should not be governed by money-grubbing corporate execs. 
$C: Fine here is an analogy. I want drive my car on the 80 mph interstate (fast internet) to reach Kansas (netflix's servers) from Texas (home network). However, I can only afford car payments of $100 a month and there are only two places I can lease cars from: Place ONE (fast isp) sells Bugatti, Tesla, and Ferrari while place TWO (slow isp) sells Prius and other hybrids. So with only $100 I get a Prius. Now going to Kansas (netflix) I can only go 40 mph as I am not allowed on the interstate and have to take slower highways (slow internet). With this slower speed (internet) it take double as long to reach Kansas (netflix).



Back to ISPs now. the difference between dial up and wired internet is so massive watching a 720p basic hd movie on Netflix would be impossible on dial up. However if your choices are cheap dial up and inflated wired internet prices and you are broke trying to get online then dial up is your only option.
We need regulated ISPs so that we can foster more competition or set baselines for speeds and prices ISPs can offer and charge. Calling 1 Mbps "fast internet" because it is technically faster than dial up is still deceptive.
$C: That one. Why's it allowed? 
$C: It does when your college considers your connection timed out if it takes too long.
$C: Blacksburg, VA

I only had comcast in both dorms, as well as the apartments I lived offsite on.
$C: I'm agreeing with you that he should while pointing out your idiocy bringing up past presidents and SoS's ability to change their minds when that has no consequence whatsoever to the current administration. 

So you either didn't read my response, didn't interpret it correctly, or can't read.  


$C: You're absolutely right. It's completely false that he changed his mind so much in one day, that republicans had to remind him of what he originally said. What do I put now? Oh right. /s
$C: I hope you flop like a fish out of water and fucking die
Honestly, you and people like your mindset are toxic
No more peace
No more tolerance
You are the problem.
$C: Read the first sentence and read the second sentence.  He's got a Scrödenger's leaker thing going on.
$C: And it took you until trump to figure that out? Not the retard, bama, the monkeyman bush, or the sexual deviant Clinton? 
$C:  They occupy more acreage, not a higher percentage of the population.  They only have power due to a broken system that they prevent from being fixed.
$C: Their platform *is* pretty disgusting.  There's very little they have to say of value.  I can't think of much that they bring to the table.

I in no way would oppose them disbanding and being replaced by a center left party to balance against the Democrats' center-righr policies.
$C: I don't think you can be an intelligent person and be a republican. 

You can totally be conservative, but the Republican party as it stands today is a cancer.
$C: Your argument is only valid if Democrats persecuted Snowden and Republicans didn’t. That does not seem to be true. Therefore, your argument is only valid as a criticism of American politicians in general, not as a criticism of the Democratic Party in particular.
$C: So what you're sayong is one option is objectively better,  so they aren't the same.

Gotcha, glad we're in agreement.
$C: I left the country when I was 12 to go to international school because of my dads job so yeah I did

$C: Ah, the owning another person fetish. Oh dear, I’m in chains please don’t whip me master. 
$C: It says it originated in the 90s actually
$C: That’s a complete democracy and that would fail very very quickly. 
$C: So then what would be the point of a house and a senate? If you read my comment you'll see that I find it ridiculous that in a so called democracy you can have bills that are supported BOTH by a majority of citizens AND a majority of the house and senate and they STILL get blocked. That my friend is fucked up
$C: That's like saying without 100% laissez faire capitalism you can't have capitalism.
$C: I wasnt sure if you were being sarcastic or not. So yeah, I don't think a complete democracy is a good idea 
$C: Talk about a strawman. That's not what the Hastert Rule is. The idea is that even if the *majority of the House* supports something, they would not bring it up for a vote unless a *majority of the majority party* also supported it.
$C: What? 
$C: who's your house representative?
$C: I have never seen a minority group more lazy or parasitic than the wealthy.

$C: What's a really good reason NOT to have universal healthcare? 
$C: And? 

That's like saying

"Only hungry people want sandwiches"

$C: Universal healthcare, easy. 
$C: Rather pay more taxes for healthcare than to continue inflating the military
$C: >You can't have universal healthcare with low taxes and tax breaks and loopholes for the top 1%

FTFY
$C: I'd gladly pay more taxes knowing all Americans have insurance. 
$C: Raise taxes to get rid of health insurance premiums and deductibles, sign me up! Everyone but the wealthy would save money, and the wealthy can afford to chip in their share to improve the healthcare of the entire country.
$C: I'm fine with paying more in taxes if it means less people have to choose between homelessness or dying of cancer
$C: Universal healthcare without question every single time. Gladly.
$C: I pick Healthcare for me and everyone.  Easiest choice ever.

Also every other country with Universal Healthcare spends a lower percentage of their GDP on Healthcare than the US.
$C: > the less we saw others as people and more of resources

That's called being a psychopath, or just a bad person in general.
$C: That's a pretty shitty way to look at things, tbh. "I got mine, screw everyone else." Yeah. You're an asshole. Sorrynotsorry. 
$C: The fact that capitalists like you depend on the deaths of the poor to make a dime is why this evil system must be taken out back and shot.
$C: How would it be a restraint? Unless you have invested in stocks from health insurance companies I don't see how universal healthcare would negatively affect your investments.

We already pay coverage for everyone, that's what health insurance is, and why hospitals charge so much. Anyone that pays for health insurance pays more than their share to cover for everyone else. Hospitals charge insurance companies more than what they should to cover their losses from uninsured people. Wealthy people don't get insurance because they can be self insured.

The current system puts the entire financial burden of healthcare onto the lower and middle class. Universal healthcare won't be anymore expensive, it will be cheaper because there won't be insurance companies taking their rather significant cut of the money. It will be cheaper as well because the wealthy will have to contribute their share instead of being self insured.

> But the wealthier we got the less we saw others as people and more of resources.

So over time you became a shitty person?  How could you even type that out without being disgusted with yourself?
$C: I don't know how this isn't being a textbook asshole.
$C: Isn't that just setting up a system to always be wrong?
$C: It is a Republic, a Constitutional Republic in fact, did they not teach American History or civics in grade school?
$C: Yeah but there's always jackasses on both sides


$C: Whatever you say,  fascist. 
$C: What?
$C: That's unfortunate if you are.  I'm a mechanical engineer and I see the glaring run-on's and misused commas like a sore thumb. 
$C: By the by, I’m sorry you keep getting downvoted. If this isn’t contributing to a discussion, idk what is
$C: It’s not a “correction”. Nobody implied that Trump wasn’t president. The point of the comment wasn’t to correct an error, but to rub salt in a wound. That suggests a personality that delights in Trump’s victory and the misery it has caused real Americans, and that suggests someone who hates America.

Yes, that’s, right, I said *real* Americans. You have no right to complain. You’ve been calling yourselves the only real Americans for decades.
$C: **Sunil Tripathi**

Sunil Tripathi was an American student who went missing on March 16, 2013. His disappearance received widespread media attention after he was wrongfully accused on social media as a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing. Tripathi had been missing for a month prior to the April 15, 2013 bombings. His body was found on April 23, after the actual bombing suspects had been officially identified and apprehended.

$C: You are exactly right.  Everyone who is making it seem like this is anything but a political statement \- i.e. a path toward a policy \- is being dishonest.  

There is no path for this bill becoming law in this Congress.  It probably won't get a vote in the House.  If it gets a vote in the House, it will lose.  If it were to win, it would not become law.  

I would like the opposite to be true, but hopes don't make policies.
$C: Then try and do something about it at your state and local level. 
$C: Yeah remember what happened last time there was a moderately favored democratic candidate
$C: > The “map is bad” for the Senate argumsnt is kind of stupid.

The map is bad is an understatement.  This is one of the worst senate maps for Democrats in decades.  It's only Trump's incredible unpopularity that gives them a fighting chance of taking the senate.  

2020's map on the other hand... 
$C: To start, yes. But then things will get worse as time goes on.
$C: Actually, an open internet would mean that the ISPs are transparent about their practices. Open, as in they aren't hiding any dubious business practices or anything from us. Net Neutrality limits their ability to even do such things. So, while they aren't exactly the same, they are definitely not exclusive from each other either. One is the product of another. 
$C: And all this happens through the fucking FCC. How hard is it to understand that they controling the internet is the absolute opposite of free internet?
$C: [deleted]
$C: That's not what it does. If you actually read what it means, it clearly states it doesn't prevent censorship.
$C: It's not addressing the people that don't use Reddit, it's addressing the trolls, the tantrums, and the ten year olds. The ones that you honestly do not want voting for you.
$C: This whole thread on reddit is biased info. 
$C: Yeah Im against mandatory voting because freedom of speech means freedom to also not speak, but it's a valid point.

I think the main problem is we have a two party system and not many major differences between the two parties. So they pick minor issues to divide and conquer the population at the expense of the people.

Both parties want to meddle in our personal lives and foreign affairs and to deficit spend like crazy. Those are the big issues fucking all of us that both parties do, while they distract us with gay marriage, meaningless gun laws, net neutrality, etc.

I have my opinions about net neutrality, but they are almost a non-factor on how I vote, or if I choose to abstain from voting.
$C: That's not how it works at all. 

The primaries are what push candidates towards the party fringe, as they are forced to compete with internal challengers on their side of the political spectrum. Yet come the general election, candidates quickly are drawn back towards the center, as they generally end up winning based on the independent vote. It's essentially the median voter theorem in a two party first past the post system. 

Just because you're an active participant in politics, or are willing to vote voluntarily, doesn't mean you are "fanatic" or a "crazy". Arguably, mandatory voting systems simply exacerbate the problem of uneducated voters, as people who could care less about politics are all-the-sudden incentivized to participate in an election that they have no background knowledge in. This can lead to the creation of a large voting bloc full of what are effectively irrational actors voting based on arbitrary criteria from good looks to how the name sounds, or even something as simple as voting for the same party your parents voted for when you were a child.


$C: Yup.
$C: You're missing the big picture. All those little projects of the Democrats are vote buying. They don't care that their programs aren't run well. Same with the Republicans and the military.

The big picture is we're losing our freedoms, our spending money, and losing lives to foreign wars. But keep fretting about minor bullshit like where planned Parenthood is getting their money or which corporate sponsors run the internet....
$C: Hell yeah they are. 

ACA was A LOT better than nothing, and if Republicans had their way, there would be no "socialist" public schools, no public libraries, and no public radio or television.
$C: Yeah great idea, let’s just limit everyone’s opportunity. If you aren’t rich, you shouldn’t be able to do shit, right?
$C: >I chose not to go to school because I couldn't afford it.

Then you didn't choose not to go to school.
$C: We can disagree, doesn’t change the fact that GOP policy is counterproductive in those areas.

$C: You do realize that you're the one fighting FOR government control over the internet, right?
$C: Eh, it's a wierd thing though with this. Because NO net  neutrality is literally less government regulation, but obviously bad. Whereas Having Net Neutrality is government regulation, but obviously good. Blocking access to websites is Government Regulation, but obviously Bad. So this is kind of a different situation. I do agree though, the internet is very important, Free information is a commodity in and of itself. I will defend the 1st with the 2nd if the time comes, which it hopefully won't. but who knows.
$C: The Government isn't going to march tanks down the street and Bomb cities with resistance. It would be a one sided Guerilla war. Not to mention if something like that happened,  most cops, and most people in the military would refuse to do that and probably join with the other side. It isn't nearly as cut and dry as you make it seem. Shit ifit was, then we would have had Vietnam in the bag. Not to mention the middle east has not nearly been as easy of a fight as you make it seem. The Government would not fair well when 30+ million gun owners decide not to pay taxes. You are correct to an extent, We need Machine guns, and DD and everything the military has, which we really do...Tons of people own machine guns, and Tanks, and howitzers, and bombs, he'll I just ordered an M203 Grenade Launcher. So....Not just fallout loving people with shotguns. 
$C: Like people who use the PC agenda to push thier own hatred. Like people who yell and scream "You can't understand because you're a cis white male!" All it is is a shield for those people to express thier hatred of one group while patting themselves on the back for being "inclusive". I have no issue with Homosexuals, for Blacks, for Arabics, Asians, Trans (Though I admit I don't understand or get them.), etc. I have no issues with anyone, but if I say something right wing, or conservative, then get told that I'm a cis white male who can't understand, or even worse, I expressed my enjoyment of guns on campus when i was in college and was told "You would like to see more guns in schools so that way you can masturbate to the corpses of dead children." Not even joking and I was extremely taken aback. I tried to take it to...someone, since she started to follow me around campus, but no one cared, "She's a girl what can she do?" or "Well you instigated it.". And that's just the one incident, I've been called very nasty things by people who would call themselves PC or Inclusive, they use it to hide behind, so they can hate from a place with no criticism. 
$C: Yeah Except we have had an Assault Weapons Ban. And an AWB has been introduced to Congress, and Tons of States are enacting AWBs. Just because your idea of a ban is ALL GUNS, doesn't mean other, smaller bans are happening. It's what they do, they move the Goal Posts,  so next time they move them closer. They were moved when the NFA passed, But we got to keep our machine guns, and Sbrs and SBSs we just needed paper work. Then the GCA required a FFL and a Background check. Then the 86 FOPA act was supposed to allow people to move from state to state without being hassled by the police in that state, because they have firearms, but also banned new machine guns being put on the nfa registry, and mind you, there have only been 2 homicides TOTAL that were commited with a machine gun, both of which were perpetrated by a corrupt cop. Then in 1994 the Clinton Assault Weapon Ban took effect, it banned what people call Assault Weapons, which is a bullshit, catchall term that refers to Modern rifles used in Sporting or Hunting, like the AR10 THE AR15, the AKM etc. The ban passed because it had a sunset clause on it, after 10 years, Congress could decide to pass it again, or it would become null and void. 10 years pass, several studies are done, and it is found that the 94 ban did NOTHING, to reduce Gun Violence. So now here we are in 2018, and Diane Fienstien, the fucking zombie,  wants to introduce an AWB that would ban all semi automatic firearms, which is ALMOST ALL FUCKING FIREARMS. Not to mention it would ban any firearm CAPABLE of having more than 10 rounds in a magazine, which bans NEARLY EVERY SINGLR FIREARM, except for a few lever actions, shotguns, and some milsurp stuff like a mosin. So they might not remove the 2nd amendment, but people fucking act like it isn't there already, because if it was, the NFA, THE GCA, FOPA AND THE AWB, wouldn't have passed, and people would look at the new AWB and say, "Thats clearly unconstitutional." and ignore it! 
$C: Not only republican but republican lead. Rather than Democrat lead, which net neutrality is. 
$C: What? I don’t want so-called Net Neutrality legislation. 
$C: Unfortunately, I don't have anything concrete for you there.  The bombing occurred on April 15.  After that, for three days the bombers did very little.  On April 18, those photos were released, and soon afterward they murdered Sean Collier for his gun, carjacked and kidnapped Danny Meng, forced him to withdraw money from ATMs for them, and the next day was the shootout.

It's possible that this was the plan all along, but to me it suggests that they were content to lie low until they found out that the FBI was looking for them, and then they tried to gather resources to flee.
$C: America has a huge problem with citizens hating each other over political stances, especially since it has always been fairly right-wing anyways
$C: >I'll save the explanations for people who actually matter and listen to others.

This is why people question net neutrality in the first place--it's some sort of religious cult where people don't even question or ask what it is they believe in, they just believe in it and condemn anyone a heathen (or in this case, a 'moron') who dares put the church on trial.

Sorry, but Facebook, Reddit, Google, et. al. haven't exactly proven they have humanity's best interests at heart, and seeing how hard they push Net Neutrality, it makes me want to pause and investigate both sides before I make a hard decision in supporting it.
$C: Ok, but I'm referring to the aspects of Title II regulations that protect NN.
$C: You're comparing internet providers to websites, apples and oranges have more in common. 

It's the same as comparing water supplies to soda companies.
$C: I was talking about the guy above dude.  

Gotta hand it to you though, you're really doing your part to MAGA #draintheswamp #gamersriseup and all that jazz
$C: Massive companies usually change quickly. You're right. You also probably don't notice since cell carriers are already allowed to freeze out competition by not counting certain traffic against the data cap ala T-Mobile.

>The world that Net Neutrality pretends to combat had ample chance to exist and it never did, because it's not profitable to sell a shitty internet service with randomly slow and blocked websites. No one wants this product. Only governments enable this product, not companies.

HA, this one is easy to disprove see the following. 

Madison River - 2006 VOIP access blocked. straight up denied.  

Comcast, 2005 blocking any P2P access they can find.

Telus - 2005 blocked access to a server that had information about a strike against said company.   

ATT 2007-2009 blocked skype on all iphones and any other VOIP competitors to its cell service, incliuding google voice app. 

Windstream 2010 - Hijacked browsers to redirect from google to their own shitty search engine. No way to disable.    

Metro PCS - 2010 blocked ALL streaming services EXCEPT youtube on all of it's networked cell phones.    

PAXFIRE - 2011 The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person’s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service’s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites.     

ATT Sprint and verison - 201-2013 blocked all usages of "Google Wallet" while redirecting attempts to it's own wallet "Isis"   

shall I continue? there are literally thousands like this.


$C: My two favorite things. America and The Punisher. A man can’t love comics and country? You hate America, I’m not surprised in the least. 
$C: DAE hate America? xD lol xD
$C: > I would say I have more confidence in concrete regulations than the vague assurance of the free market.

I completely understand :)

I'm probably just a bit more pro capitalism & pro free markets than the average Redditor, so I'm not quite ready to give up on the dream of a free & competitive market just yet.
$C: If net neutrality is about censorship please explain why it does not apply to data servers or internet platforms. Both are much more centralized and pose a much greater threat to freedom of speech, while any censorship attempt by an ISP can be  bypassed using a simple vpn. I'm all for the idea of "net neutrality", I just don't like the idea of the public being lured into a false sense of security by a bill which only serves to make internet access more expensive while making access to unproductive media cheaper.
$C: You are claiming that no CDN should ever have to pay for transit?
$C: **Net neutrality in the United States**

In the United States, net neutrality has been an issue of contention between network users and access providers since the 1990s.

In 2005, under Republican Chair Kathleen Abernathy, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted policies and rules establishing principles of “network neutrality” in order to carry out the policy of the United States “to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet” and “to promote the continued development of the Internet," “encourag[ing] the deployment on a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications capability” – broadband – “to all Americans.” The FCC noted that Congress had cited the Internet's educational and informational importance, and the fact that "[t]he Internet also represents “a forum for a true diversity of political discourse, unique opportunities for cultural development, and myriad avenues for intellectual activity," as well as "play[ing] an important role in the economy, as an engine for productivity growth and cost savings."

In order "to ensure that providers of telecommunications for Internet access or Internet Protocol-enabled (IP-enabled) services are operated in a neutral manner," and noting that its "Enforcement Bureau recently entered into a consent decree to resolve an investigation with respect to the blocking of ports used for voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)," the Commission adopted network neutrality principles "to preserve and promote the vibrant and open character of the Internet as the telecommunications marketplace enters the broadband age."

Throughout 2005 and 2006, corporations on both sides of the issue lobbied Congress. Between 2005 and 2012, five attempts to pass bills in Congress containing net neutrality provisions failed. Proponents claimed that these bills would preserve the open Internet that consumer groups sought, and to prohibit Internet service providers from using various variable pricing models based upon the user's quality of service level, described as tiered service in the industry and as price discrimination arising from abuse of "local monopolies enshrined in law" by some economists.

$C: Faster internet will come. T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon are about to enter the broadband wireless market. Suddenly markets with one real ISP will have 4. In a way you're right that we wouldn't see a change. If not for the new competition, comcast would happily throttle Netlix in favor of their own content creating a literal monopoly on their network.

$C: You’re really good at telling us that we don’t know things. Why don’t you dumb it down and explain it to us with legitimate sources. 
$C: Corporations legally would include them but in the way most people understand the word it would not. You could call an indie game developer a corporation but if you posted that in r/hailcorporate it wouldn't be seen as such
$C: Not under title II, the heavily 1934 phone regulatory creation, jammed under that with the nuclear option by the FCC Chair. That happened in 2015. NN type lawsuits by State AG's and others prior to that was enforced by the FTC. Once it was forced into title II, designating the ISP's as common carriers like phone companies, it locked out lawsuits of that type.

Bill Clinton's FCC Chair knew it was a bad idea to put the internet under title II. Pai had the right idea moving it back out. He basically threw the ring of Sauron into Mt. Doom, but by a string, with the promise to pull it back and use it if he saw specific anti competetive practices happen. He also allowed the FTC  (consumer) legal avenues to open back up. It was pretty honorable and brilliant IMO.

As to any new NN law here, I am resistant to it only because I don't trust congress, and I understand market competition is the only thing that drives down cost and increases quality. Congress is allowing massive mergers to continue to take place, and allows cable companies to act as monopolies in their territories.

One final thing, I know that no matter the wringing of hands over the possibility to throttle, I know from personal professional experience in this industry, that the customer always wins in the game of access to popular content, and technology innovation in 5G is opening up yet another avenue for competition. We don't need government protecting Comcast OR Netflix, because they will only eventually work to solidify the positions of giant monopolies and stifle competition, retard technology advancement fueled by competition.
$C: You are asking me to respond to a block of text when I don't know the context. The internet was fine before 2015. It will be fine after NN too. If there is a problem, we can address it. We don't need expensive regulations for hypothetical situations. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Are you willingly ignoring the last 30 years where FCC brought legal cases to ISPs without the use of Net Neutrality?

Net Neutrality was a concept born out of the beginnings of mainstream internet. The concept was used in many legal cases before 2015.

Penning the 2015 Net Neutrality rules was figuratively writing the law of gravity. It was always there, just not formally defined. Brought about by ISPs challenging that there was no "legal" publication defining exactly what it meant. 
$C: >The obvious alternative would have been to do what the FCC should have done and — in the future tense — now should do, which is to reclassify broadband under Title II authority.

Tim Wu, the guy who still supports Title 2 Net Neutrality.

That was just after the courts struck down the 2010 Open Internet Order, which led to the 2015 open internet order.

He's said that the title 2 was the way to go, after what you quoted. A lot of change happened in the past fifteen years. TCP/IP suite, not so much, buuuuuut the hardware to support it has. And they do pay for the increase of data used. Literally paying for the speed you use, how it works.

If I try to run a video streaming service of a dial up modem, it wouldn't work so well cause I don't pay enough to do that and I don't get enough speed to do that.

Also

That's the eleventh time someone used u/ow-pointy's copy pasta in part, or entirety on reddit.

He should get some sort of prize or something.

Especially since you didn't credit him, for shame.
$C: They aren’t trying to loose your business they will try to keep the customer happy...
$C: That is not what I mean at all. I mean they will slow down less visited websites and speed up more visited websites I’m not saying they will compress or store information to make the page faster. 
$C: > Except they don’t because they are the only isp in the area

And this is the problem that needs to be solved. Net Neutrality/Title II does nothing to solve this, the actual problem.

> I simply don’t trust them to do the morally right thing, so we have to strong arm them into being ethically straight. 

Same. Which is why I'd prefer solutions that solve the problem of lack of choice, since it's that lack of choice that removes consumer control.
$C: No, the government runs on the exclusive right to use violence to gain compliance. The government is ultimately powerful in the USA.
$C: Alright. So explain. Why should I give my ISP the ability to regulate my internet the same way TV and Radio is doled out.

Especially since I can talk to you now the same way I can talk to you on Facebook, Youtube, all emails, news outlets, random internet forums, fuck just all of social media in general. Without any throttling, extra payments, or preferential treatment.

CONSIDERING the fact that ISP's have ALREADY violated NN.

Here's your chance m'bro.
$C: Good bot. We need smarter Redditors in this thread.
$C: What evidence is there for it being in effect still? 
$C: Let's stop for a moment here. What does it mean to be "for the repeal"?

Well, our goal is to save net neutrality, so the only meaning of "for the repeal" that could possibly matter is "taking actions that cause the repeal to happen". What you *want* doesn't even come remotely close to mattering.

Voting Republican is an action that causes the repeal to happen. Therefore, people who vote Republican are for the repeal.

People who want net neutrality but voted Republican aren't going to like hearing that, of course. That's the point. I'm informing them that if they really, *truly* want net neutrality, then it's within their power to save it. All they have to do is... stop voting Republican. Or even better, vote Democrat.

It's because of people who blindly vote Republican that the United States is dying.
$C: What does that have to do with net neutrality?
$C: Hey, ValuingHydra, just a quick heads-up:  
**arguement** is actually spelled **argument**. You can remember it by **no e after the u**.

$C: 1. No i did not. Dont tell me what my thought process was i know what it was. What i implied is that there is a large contingent of people on this platform who absolutely helped get trump elected. The red pill has over 100k subscribers. Who do you think those guys voted for? 

2. About half our population votes. Plent of conservatives didnt vote, voted third party or for clinton, or skipped voting for the president. 

4. Im aware how people on reddit feel about net neutrality but i dont think that equals concern for the state od the country as a whole. I see very little of that outside of political subs.
$C: Given that he named himself u/_Milton_Friedman_ , [he probably means something along these lines.](https://youtu.be/lb65IWJQgrc)

Do you think it's impossible for someone to understand net neutrality and still be against it?
$C: Oh?  You didn't generalize me to my knowledge.  I might have jumped on one of your other replies though.
$C: > You can go to other websites. 

You can use another ISP. 

Derpity derp. 

What a fucking shitty argument.

Fuck everything about communist net neutrality censorship. Democrats are downright evil for still trying to push this through.
$C: Point stipulated but doesn't government intervention counter your natural competition argument? I would like to see these so called starter companies who have been vehemently attacked. I will concede that I myself don't have a direct solution to this issue nor am I up to speed on the statistics of what areas are controlled by certain ISPs but I am aware we have anti-trust laws that are supposed to prevent such monopolies. If net neutrality's main directive was to foster free market principles by granting access to broader competition I would like you support it but from what I read, heard, and researched it seems more like a government overreach cloaked in utilitarianism.

$C: 173. Out of an abundance of caution, we grant a temporary exemption for these providers, with the potential for that exemption to become permanent. It is unclear, however, how best to delineate the boundaries of this exception. Clearly, it should include those providers likely to be most disproportionately affected by new disclosure requirements. ACA “acknowledge[s] that Congress and the Commission have defined ‘small’ in various ways.”429 One metric to which ACA points is the approach that the Commission used in its 2013 Rural Call Completion Order, which excepted providers with 100,000 or fewer subscriber lines, aggregated across all affiliates, from certain recordkeeping, retention, and reporting rules.430 We adopt this definition for purposes of the temporary exemption that we adopt today. Accordingly, we hereby adopt a temporary exemption from the enhancements to the transparency rule for those providers of broadband Internet access service (whether fixed or mobile) with 100,000 or fewer broadband subscribers as per their most recent Form 477, aggregated over all the providers’ affiliates.431

See also id. at 6 (reporting on an ex parte meeting in which a representative of an ACA member “confirmed that realtime network congestion disclosures would be highly burdensome for a small ISP”). 

c. Information Collection and Reporting Provisions (Sections 211, 213, 215, 218-20) 508. In addition, although some commenters advocate that the Commission retain provisions of the Act that provide “discretionary powers to compel production of useful information or the filing of regular reports,” we find the section 10(a) factors met and grant forbearance.1547 However, the cited provisions principally are used by the Commission to implement its traditional rate-making authority over common carriers.1548 Here, we do not apply tariffing requirements or ex ante rate regulation of broadband Internet access service of the sort for which these requirements would be needed. Indeed, we cannot and do not envision adopting such requirements in the future. Thus, we do not find it necessary or in the public interest to apply these provisions simply in anticipation of such an exceedingly unlikely scenario. Moreover, as particularly relevant here, section 706 of the 1996 Act, along with other statutory provisions, give the Commission authority to collect necessary information.1549 We recognize that the Commission generally did not forbear from these requirements in the CMRS context, noting the minimal regulatory burdens they imposed on such providers, and observing that reservation of this Commission authority would allow further consideration of possible information collection requirements, given that “the cellular market is not yet fully competitive.”1550 As explained above, in this context, however, we find forbearance to be the more prudent course, and therefore in the public interest under section 10(a)(3), given both our intention of tailoring the regulations applicable to broadband Internet access service given our responsibility under section 706 to encourage deployment.1551 Because we also do not find the information collection and reporting provisions raised by commenters to be necessary at this time within the meaning of sections 10(a)(1) and (a)(2), we forbear from applying these provisions insofar as they

D. Description of Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements for Small Entities 55. The Order clarifies and adopts certain incremental enhancements to the existing transparency rule, which was adopted in 2010, and will continue to require providers of broadband Internet access services to “publicly disclose accurate information regarding the network management practices, performance, and commercial terms of its broadband Internet access services sufficient for consumers to make informed choices regarding use of such services and for content, application, service, and device providers to develop, market, and maintain Internet offerings.”154 We summarize below the record keeping and reporting obligations of the accompanying Order. Additional information on each of these requirements can be found in the Order. 56. First, we clarify that all of the pieces of information described in paragraphs 56 and 98 of the 2010 Open Internet Order have been required as part of the current transparency rule, and we will continue to require the information as part of our enhanced rule. The only exception is the requirement to disclose “typical frequency of congestion,” which we no longer require since it is superseded by more precise disclosures already required by the rule, such as actual performance. Also, the requirement that all disclosures made by a broadband provider be accurate includes the need to maintain the accuracy of these disclosures. 57. Second, we enhance and describe in more specific terms than in 2010 the information to be provided in disclosing commercial terms, network performance characteristics, and network practices. For example, in meeting the existing requirement to disclose “actual performance,” providers of broadband Internet access services will be required to report packet loss, in addition to the already required metrics of speed and latency. 58. Third, we require that providers directly notify end users if their particular use of a network will trigger a network practice, based on a user’s demand during more than the period of congestion, that is likely to have a significant impact on the end user’s use of the service. The purpose of such notification is to provide the affected end users with sufficient information and time to consider adjusting their usage to avoid application of the practice. 59. Fourth, we establish a voluntary safe harbor that providers may use in meeting the existing requirement to make transparency disclosures in a format that meets the needs of end users. The safe harbor consists of the use of a standalone disclosure targeted to end users. Based on concerns raised in the record by smaller providers of broadband Internet access service, however, we do not at this time require use of this standalone format, and instead have submitted this issue to the Consumer Advisory Committee for further consideration. 155  

$C: I said that clear enough. They took control of the Internet in 2015 the way China has

If Verizon is their only option then competition is already dead and net neutrality didn't do as you thought 

Google can very well do it with or without them, it was a lie
$C: Yes, but you aren't dealing with a group of people who have to do what they're told, when they're told.

The general public takes considerable convincing to do something that requires sustained effort on their part, which means you have to take a marketing approach.

$C: **Public utility**

A public utility (usually just utility) is an organization that maintains the infrastructure for a public service (often also providing a service using that infrastructure). Public utilities are subject to forms of public control and regulation ranging from local community-based groups to statewide government monopolies.

The term utilities can also refer to the set of services provided by these organizations consumed by the public: electricity, natural gas, water, sewage, telephone, and transportation. Broadband internet services (both fixed-line and mobile) are increasingly being included within the definition.

***

**United States**

The United States of America (USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S.) or America, is a federal republic composed of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2) and with over 325 million people, the United States is the world's third- or fourth-largest country by total area and the third-most populous country. The capital is Washington, D.C., and the largest city by population is New York City. Forty-eight states and the capital's federal district are contiguous and in North America between Canada and Mexico.

***

**Natural monopoly**

A natural monopoly is a monopoly in an industry in which high infrastructural costs and other barriers to entry relative to the size of the market give the largest supplier in an industry, often the first supplier in a market, an overwhelming advantage over potential competitors. This frequently occurs in industries where capital costs predominate, creating economies of scale that are large in relation to the size of the market; examples include public utilities such as water services and electricity. Natural monopolies were discussed as a potential source of market failure by John Stuart Mill, who advocated government regulation to make them serve the public good.

$C: So you would consider telecommunications a utility? 
$C: Well that's why people get so confused about this. The only reason we even need NN is because of legislation brought forth by monopolies meant to corner the market and limit competition. If that is the natural direction companies will take(using government to limit compeition) then that leaves us with few options to fix the power imbalance, thus fight fire with fire and regulate them. 

The free market itself cannot correct government sponsored monopolies because they are simply no longer just a product of a free market.

It's like a paradox by design
$C: I consider myself a liberal, and think regulation is absolutely necessary to maintain a free market. A free market is naturally an unstable equilibrium, and will collapse to unfair markets without constant evaluation and readjustment.
$C: That train of thought seems decidedly simplistic.

'I agree with this general process of economics' doesn't mean championing even the dumbest of ideas just because some people say that it gets lumped in there (due to partisan agenda).

If a clear monopoly exists then there is no 'free market' or 'competition to drive growth and quality' and therefore axing NN clearly seems to harm the free market more than benefit it.

Note: I'm not a conservative, just providing my thoughts. At the moment conservatism in the US seems very binary and 'deregulate everything!' even when it isn't necessarily in keeping with their own supposed philosophy - a balanced market where everyone has a chance. 
$C: Haha absolutely agree

$C: A matter that affects Reddit's bottom line just so happens to also affect each one of its user's ability to access a fair Internet without an a-la-carte service model. It's possible that a company can make money off of good policymaking.
$C: Oh I do, but that self serving happens to coinside with the greater good. So, in this case, I'm fine with it. 
$C: I agree that corporations should be heavily policed on what they can and can't endorse. But Comcast, Verizon and AT&T are not holding back any punches when denouncing the evils of Net Neutrality. So why should Reddit get a slap on the hand for combating it?

$C: Honestly, reddit should become a subscription/paid service, maybe with a free tier for defaults. I wouldn't mind shelling out a subscription the same way I do Netflix, and it would help keep the fucking bots out too.

I'm getting sick of how disproportional the whole privacy conversation has been lately. Facebook and Google come out as having done very sketchy things with your data, and everybody parrots the "you're the product" line like they're saying something new. But no one is willing to flip that around and put money where their mouth is. If people wanna be the customer instead of the product, pay up, I'd sure as hell be glad to.
$C: Reddit actually losing money. If they added google ads they would make a lot of money but.... a lot of people would flip shit because of google ad's natural ability to de-anonymize. 

But as more companies see the potential in advertising on reddit, they should make a lot of money. 
$C: > You can either be ruled over by corporations or the government

False dilemma. I don't believe that for a moment, and I've always wondered how paranoid and anti-capitalist you have to be to believe that.

Also, corporations cannot do anything to me without my permission. A corporation can't tax me. A corporation can't arrest me. A corporation can't imprison me. The government can do anything it wants with me.

So if I *had* to choose, I'd choose the guy trying to sell me stuff, over the guy who has a gun to my head. I'd pick the corporation in a heartbeat. There's absolutely no question.
$C: Save your comments. He’s one of them. 
$C: There is no limit to how pathetic the republican cult of traitors can get.  
$C: I justified it by mocking the original scaremongering that the internet as you knew it would end. I could also mock the government's previous failed takeovers of private industry if you like. Amtrak, postal service, Obamacare, etc. I'm sure they'll get the internet right though!
$C: I'm old enough to remember the gloating of the left about how clueless and unqualified Trump was to be president, how he didn't even want to be president, how racist he was, how his Twitter would start WWIII. And then GDP grew 4%, black unemployment hit an all-time low, we got hostages back without paying ransom, the UN started paying its dues, and North Korea came to the table, among dozens of other accomplishments.

Granted, to remember all that I'd only have to be about 18 months old.

I look forward to your continued cries of bigotry, racism, sexism, etc etc as you continue your *historic* loss of power in the 2020 election, which Trump will win in a landslide. Let me remind you that Trump won because he took *blue states*. Blue states filled with blue collar democrats who realized that it's the policies of the left that do not work, and so they decided to take a chance on Trump. It's working very well for them. Cry and scream about non-issues like NN all day. You think the rust belt cares? You've already lost. I'm looking forward to your increased confusion when once again reality does not support your fantasy.
$C: If that's true, how come your supermajority \(president \+ both houses\) increased the national debt by about a trillion dollars in their first six months while the "other side" supermajority decreased it by a hundred billion in their first six months?

Maybe you slept through economics.
$C: Then you probably should have paid attention in school.
$C: Then ignore the news and leave the thinking to the adults. Politics are not easy or pleasant, but they are important and require a little more than \*feelings\* and \*uninformed outrage\*, contrary to what Reddit indicates. Hundreds of thousands of men gave their lives so that you could enjoy the freedoms and benefits of our particular form of government. I personally think its shameful to not even make an academic effort in honor of their sacrifices, but if that is indeed too much for you, then the least you can do is remain neutral and defer to those who make an effort to protect the system that allows you to live so comfortably.
$C: Just in case anyone is wondering what heuristic means.


>**heu·ris·tic**  
hyo͞oˈristik    
noun  
plural noun: heuristics  
**a heuristic process or method.**  
the study and use of heuristic techniques.  
noun: heuristics  

Just kidding...
 

**Basically it means**: learning by experimenting. Figuring something out through trial-and-error.
$C: I really don't foresee them moving on it very quickly. 
$C: Hm. Okay that makes sense
$C: The problem is the system itself, reps and senators get to office and became fixated on staying there. That changes their policies and what they vote against/for because they follow their voters instead of leading them.
$C: Lmao CNN? Bruh the Fox News of the left is MSNBC. CNN is actually relatively moderate. Don’t listen to the Trumpisms.
$C: You *could* do that, but you'd be absolutely wrong, as all evidence, history, and voting records suggest.


$C: Dude, Neil Gorsuch is a Supreme Court justice. He would not be if the Dems had won. This fatalism only hurts our chances, we need every vote

$C: Nope. Probably because he didn't.
$C: That same guy isn't going to sign this bill. Haha.
$C: The downvotes are probably rolling in because I've heard that same BS south park reference used as a convenient excuse every single time voting season rolls around.  It's edgy and cool to be apathetic and disengaged because herp\-derp\-derp south park said so.
$C: The solidarity means everything in this divisive world we live in! You the real MVP
$C: Exactly, as a liberal in Mississippi it is so disheartening to feel like I have no say in any government matters. No one represents me and my interests. 
$C: It’s one of those compromises that keeps the system balanced.

That’s where the district votes and congress comes in.
$C: So you’d rather take the vote from someone in an rural area? Literally, prevent them from even having a voice? It’s one step forward and 5 steps back.

The biggest issue is the fact there are only two “viable” parties so everyone votes to stop whichever party they disagree with.

It’s incredibly short sighted and born from an emotional reaction. Why is there no outrage over the Democratic Party fucking over their own candidate by stealing the debate questions and pulling the rug out from underneath their best choice?
$C: No. Both parties are made of mostly selfish individuals telling you want you want to hear so they can keep their power, because that power leads to big money from special interests. Doesn't matter what party. You just happen to agree with the special interests on the Democrats side.

But if either cared about you or this country, we wouldn't have a patriot act. We wouldn't have the highest prison population in the world. We wouldn't have been in a single war since WW2. We wouldn't be close to $200 trillion in debt when you count unfunded liabilities.
$C: Have you seen the democratic presidential candidates? 

No one liked Hillary nor Trump. But now that we have trump as president, I’d rather people start working together instead of still ranting and raging about him becoming pres. This was over a year ago ffs. The dems refuse to do anything with Trump and it’s getting really annoying.
$C: Are you high? Clearly I'm going to pick the better of the 2, the Democrats. I made it pretty damn clear that I thought the Republicans were worse?

But they're still both terrible. 
$C: Do the slightest bit of research into the DNC emails that WikiLeaks released. 

Edit: They wanted to use his atheism against him and were trying to think of other ways to stop him. Seriouly, before you downvote this just look it up. If I'm wrong come back and downvote me
$C: Wow. Nope.

Donna Brazile, who was also chairwoman of the DNC, has stated repeatedly that Hillary all but bought the DNC. She essentially bailed them out of debt incurred by the Obama campaign and was given de facto control over the convention.

I'm no Bernie bro, but this and a dozen other things are the *legitimate* reasons Bernie supporters were upset.

Don't try to water it down.
$C: Instead of comparing the percentages of both parties that support torturers, why don't we demand a Democratic party that is united in its anti-torture principles? Why are *any* Democratic senators supporting this? This is especially important now because, like I said before, without Democratic support Haspel would likely be blocked.

So you can be damn sure I'll blame Democrats as well as Republicans for Haspel's nomination. 
$C: *crickets*
$C: He studied under trump
$C: Hit the nail on the head. My views fall closely with libertarians with a few exceptions and it gets confusing when people begin to claim to be one and start spouting nationalist bullshit.

I'll admit I waiver from the party when it comes to the EPA because I think breathing clean air is a natural born right and corporations who ruin that are infringing on others rights, and on net neutrality because our internet network is a somewhat government created Monopoly. But to see people take such a fundamental view of libertarians and denounce it while claiming to be one just to avoid being labeled alt right is frustrating to say the least.
$C: The noun Libertarian (libertario, or libertaire) in Europe, is to describe proper anarchists. I've always found confusing seeing this term used to define what is basically someone striving for absolute liberism.
$C: ah I did not know that but it certainly makes sense, but I meant more literally defend us from attack and invasion. Like Pearl Harbor or if Red Dawn became real life. And specifically defend, not attack anyone else. 
$C: >[The official LP platform](https://www.lp.org/issues/immigration/) is for open borders

uh, one party's policy does not determine the basis of libertarianism. this issue is very hotly contested, and in fact i would venture to say that most libertarians disagree with the LP on this one. 
$C: I don't disagree, I'm just explaining what they believe.
$C: no, their argument is that society wont fall into disorder because people will hold each other accountable.... 

Which, I'd say is flawed. You can say enacting libertarian ideals might lead to anarchy, but they definitely don't want anarchy, they pretty much want the ultimate version of the opposite.
$C: Nah. Libertarianism is still based on authority systems. For example, private property. In a libertarian society you can still own a factory, employ people to work in that factory and pocket the profits. In an anarchist society people won't recognize that authority: Why the hell would people respect your claim to own that factory? And with no authority system, you can't call the cops to enforce private ownership either. Therefore private ownership, and with it capitalism, cannot exist.

Anarchism is inherently a left wing ideology. Right wing libertarianism is just modern liberalism with all the safety checks removed.
$C: Libertarian socialists I guess. 
$C: They don't really exist in serious numbers, but they tend to go be "left libertarian" or just call themselves socialists.
$C: Also, the incumbents largely built their networks with taxpayer subsidies that they took while failing to fulfill their side of the bargain. But nobody holds them responsible because money is speech and they have lots of it.
$C: I honestly think the issue with full on libertarian policy in the US is largely the same as the issue with full on socialist policy. Our society just doesn't possess the cultural values necessary for that kind of environment to succeed. The more you try to take from the rich, the more tax loop holes and black market industries you begin to see popping up. The more you try to work with the rich, the more ground they grab at In order to secure their footing before the next administration kicks in. Our society just isn't built to completely share  with or trust any one group. We are all opportunists, like it or not. That being said I'm utterly ashamed of my country for not having basic universal healthcare. There's just no excuse for that.
$C: Because libertarian ideology is actually vile.

Libertarians booed a candidate off stage for agreeing that it probably should remain illegal to sell heroin to children.

Libertarians believe poor people deserve to starve to death.

Libertarians believe that they should not be beholden to any law in their pursuit of profit.

Libertarians believe it should be legal to run a child brothel.

And yes, libertarians believe you should be able to arbitrarily restrict internet access if it means you could make more money.
$C: Not trying to argue the point just answering your question about Libertarians. 

That same annual gathering has people selling eggs, bacon, etc from non-fda regulated sources too iirc. (Been a while since I listened to that podcast, but I believe that's right)

The same argument you're making works there, we should have access to safe food. 

The libertarian argument is basically, if Joe sells me bad milk I will stop buying from him and tell my friends so Joe doesn't have anyone to sell his bad milk to anymore and everyone will know to buy good milk from Bill instead who will have a roaring business because of the free market. 

They would apply that to the ISPs as well: Time Warner throttles you, switch to CableOne and tell all your friends so the free market can adapt and punish the the bad business practices while rewarding good ones. 

That doesn't work because of the government enabled monopolies ISPs have in many regions, but the libertarian view would be that it is better to remove the restrictions keeping competitors from coming in so the free market can work. If there is no (or *very* little) competition allowed the free market can't force good business practice because there is no Bill down the street to buy good milk from so you are stuck with Joe's bad milk whether you like it or not. If he decides to start watering your milk down, there's nothing you can do about it because Bill isn't even able to sell you his milk.  

The Libertarian would say rather than adding regulation to *stop* Joe from selling bad milk just open it up so Bill can sell his milk too. Or rather than adding regulations to force ISPs to treat their customers well, make sure it is as easy as possible for a good competitor to come in who will and let that balance it out. 

Edited to add: All of that said, I think some Libertarians who would prefer not to do this by adding regulations would still support it due to a realization that their preferred way is pretty unlikely to happen right now, so at least this makes sure everyone has "good milk", so to speak. (Though I suspect they would also be hopeful for projects like StarLink to come along in the relatively near future)
$C: He said are 'consistently worse' yet you have just seen that some are willing to support your cause? 
$C: Source comment. I would have said "OP", but on Reddit, "OP" is the submission or submitter rather than being the original post(er) in the thread.

Actually come to think of it I don't know the proper name for the first comment in a chain on Reddit. "Top-level comment" maybe?
$C: i see, thanks for your response
$C: [deleted]
$C: Google Fiber is pretty much doing it Tertiary, last I heard they're no longer expanding to new cities and even the cities they're in it's a very slow expansion.
$C: Sure buddy. The 97% of commenters in favour of net neutrality were paid Soros shills who don’t know that the major telecoms companies just have their best interests at heart. 

Lose the tinfoil hat.

$C: Still confused how Bernie lost. Do americans hate socialism so much.
$C: Where did I say both parties are the same? 
$C: I mean it's no excuse.  You're basically proving you value your party above representing the interests of your constituents.
$C: I prefer one those lines vastly more than the other.
$C: No, he was. Everything HE says is now WIDE OPEN to the public, thank god. It's the one thing he hasn't learned as President. Whatever HE says, can and WILL be repeated. He's the fucking leader of a country, lmao, are you kidding me? 
$C: Do you get many PMs?
$C: >Sadly I don't have enough data to construct such a list, I've just been pointing out bullshit. Perhaps go and ask The_Donald.

FTFY
$C: Oof much pathetic. I'm totally not checking for bias or anything. I'll tell you I'm biased as fuck from the other side, it's just good to be transparent. ;)
$C: You shouldn't post things online if you don't want others to find them. Just plain and simple lol. This is 2018. Wake up. 
$C: No, it's not suggesting that people do their own research and find their own data, it's in the way you word things. It's in the way you SPEAK, which is even more terrifying. 

The Republican Party knows how to deliver propaganda SO well, and all it takes is a couple of sound bites clipped JUST so, and a few headlines and a couple comments. They literally concoct giant shitstorms of ACTUAL fake news. 
$C: False. That’s the same as me claiming he republicans want anarchy.
$C: It's much easier to see the opposition as just being crazy and evil, but someday you'll figure out that people are not that simple. Politicians in general are inherently self-serving, and as such obstructionism has become the main game in US politics.

You can easily play this from both angles, "Why did the Democrats vote against deporting immigrant gangsters? They're so evil."... and so on. The people who sit here whining about how bad the other side are tend to have only exposed themselves to a one-sided view of the situation.
$C: Oh you're a clown trying to ignore context, aren't you?

> Ok. Last year there was a vote restricting sales of US military aircraft to Iran. For some reason the Democrats opposed this.

Explain to me how this is equivalent to fucking over US citizens

> A vote to pass a bill that requires the Department of Treasury to report to Congress any Iranian purchases of US aircraft and how those sales are financed.

Yeah, let's waste money watching another government buy our airplanes! That's definitely going to fuck us over like the Republicans did!!!

> There was also legislation to allow deportation of migrants who belong to illegal gangs, which again was opposed.

Hmm, let's take a closer look:

> Vote to pass a bill that authorizes deportation of any immigrant **suspected** of gang membership.

Be deported if you're suspected, with no proof? Fuck that, no wonder they didn't vote Yea.

> For some reason drought relief legislation was also an issue.

This is:

> Vote to pass a bill that provides drought relief to the state of California, among other provisions.

Yeah let's give the federal government more power to fuck around and decide how to manage our state, who already know to deal with a drought.

You're a moron. You failed in cherry-picking against the Democrats because the truth is the Republicans are that fucking bad.
$C: >Ok. Last year there was a vote restricting sales of US military aircraft to Iran. For some reason the Democrats opposed this.

This is the link in your comment: https://votesmart.org/bill/24317/62168/strengthening-oversight-of-irans-access-to-finance-act

It clearly says civilian aircraft, not military aircraft - "Requires the Treasury Department to report to Congress on the Iranian government’s financing of civilian aircraft purchases (Sec. 3)."

>There was also legislation to allow deportation of migrants who belong to illegal gangs, which again was opposed.

Again, if you read it - it's allowing for 'suspected gang members' to be deported. I have no issue with deporting proven gang members, but if you're merely pointing a finger and accusing an immigrant of being a suspect, how is that allowing due process to happen?

>For some reason drought relief legislation was also an issue.

Yes, because the water situation is extraordinarily complex in California. Not only do farmers rely on it, but so does the entire Californian biosphere. 
$C: Where below? Everyone who suggests that both parties are just as bad never produces a similar list which is odd if it's trivial to make. 
$C: She's used to it.
$C: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the\-fix/wp/2017/02/07/the\-betsy\-devos\-confirmation\-vote\-shows\-that\-mitch\-mcconnell\-knows\-exactly\-what\-hes\-doing/?utm\_term=.9def93b73863](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/07/the-betsy-devos-confirmation-vote-shows-that-mitch-mcconnell-knows-exactly-what-hes-doing/?utm_term=.9def93b73863)

ummmm.....
$C: if you'll recall, a minority of americans voted in november 2016.  among them, a minority voted for drump, including yourself.  and you didn't elect him.  electors did.  calm down.

of the people who *did* vote, a decisive majority voted for hillary clinton, and the outliers only make that anti-him majority even bigger.
$C: Gun owners have let extremists control their narrative and policy and I don't see any of the "COME AND TAKE IT" crowd bitching about the NRA. 

Fact is, smart responsible gun owners need to be coming to the table and crafting smart regulations. Instead, they let the NRA go around screaming bloody murder about stupid shit like bump stock bans that mean fuck all, and try to add credibility to their arguments by arguing semantics about what constitutes an assault weapon or the word clip. 

You can't bitch about gun laws being written by people that understand them, then have the entire gun lobby categorically oppose any and all gun laws. 

Are there reasonable, responsible gun owners? Yeah. Like being a gamer, the vocal contingent owning the narrative on that are so toxic and horrible that the rest of us don't want to be associated with them. 

When you're calling out the lame  milquetoast laws being put forth by Democrats as being OMG SO UNREASONABLE *FAINT* it's a pretty good sign you subscribe to the "all laws mean they're taking our guns so I oppose them all" argument

Shoot me a link when a group of responsible gun owners starts pushing some laws made by experts. We'd love to read it. 

What we've got now is man children being obstructionists and screaming over showing ID to buy ammo, cultivating an entire generation that realizes these people aren't mature or stable enough to be trusted with lethal force multipliers. 
$C: > oh yeah, the Mexicans ARE buying up all the houses for the white people..

wut
$C: I never said that was a factor to “quality of life”. That was just one of many reasons I *like* living in my state. The mountains and beaches don’t effect my quality of life, either... but I like them. 
$C: But you’re implying red states aren’t doing this which is just wrong. Are you considering per capita this statistic? I’d be very curious to see if the statistics back what you’re claiming 
$C: I feel you man, I hate the extreme bullshit. Everyone’s so publicly open with their views. Personally, if someone came up to me and asked me who I voted for I’d tell them to mind their fucking business. 
$C: See my edit. Sorry for the confusion! =D
$C: Bad bot.

I even had it in quotes.

$C: I hear the series is still going


am 21 btw
$C: I misread your comment. 
$C: Fwiw the nature of the Reddit voting system means that opinions coalesce around people that are more likely to have them. Reddit skews millennial/ millennial skew left, therefore there are more anti-trump subs than pro-trump subs. That said, the pro-trump subs are more extreme than one would think on a left leaning platform, except for the nature of reddit. Mods can ban people who don't follow their ideology; latestagecapitalism and thedonald are both huge on that. And you know what, i don't really think it's inherently bad, as some people want to discuss their views in peace.

What does make it bad is that the two sides become more and more extreme, and less reasonable. But, i don't think mods should be forced to allow people to their subs that they don't want either. 
$C: No that is just what you are making up in your head because you don't understand what racism is. 
$C: You're right. Dude is blatantly stereotyping. I'm pretty left, nowhere near libertarian, but I have a few libertarian friends and they're very far from being racist. It's just a political label, and labels fit few people perfectly. People are often complex. It's actually infuriating because I've seen some nasty facebook brigading against one of these friends. Totally baseless accusations by people who didn't even know him, which had an impact on the friend's profession. I've lost a lot of respect for some people I know who were involved in what was basically a witch hunt for no reason other than him being a libertarian. The militant partisanship in today's society is becoming insane.
$C: I'm sorry, I don't think anyone would perceive "chocolate" or "mayonnaise" as racial slurs.
$C: Neither of those look bad to me. Honestly, they only make me hungry.
$C: Poor white people. These years of oppression and horrific slurs have been tough on us.
$C: I'm fine with it, Fox news is racist so it really fits well. Just be glad they're not calling it the *Uneducated Redneck Deplorable "News" Network* (which they totally could)
$C: mayocide now
$C: White guys are okay with it because they don’t let the word have power over them :)
$C: The irony of this comment is thick.
$C: More gish gallop is not a defense. It's basically just admitting that is all you have.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Both sides are not the same.
$C: Just please remember it cuts both ways. That's all I ask. The people on the other "side" are just trying to make it too. We all get fucked by big media. It's in their best interest to make the commoners fight each other.
$C: [deleted]
$C: ; )
$C: Haha imagine actually thinking that as well and then copying the person you are triggered by because you don't have the intelligence to form unique sentences on your own
$C: >You've just made my point.

Inviting you to share the pros/cons you're advocating people know is making your point? All right, buddy.
$C: Interesting analogy.
$C: It's a bit easier to predict here. I'm in Newfoundland, Canada and generally speaking outside of the city in the rural communities they'll be conservative and low taxes (until they get sick and expect free helicopter rides to the hospital at their leisure) and in the downtown area you see the left wing NDP. Red liberals scattered throughout. But also generally speaking everything we have is left of everything in the states. 

I'm surprised that's not common, we're constantly bombarded with mail outs during all elections. And the disgusting sign wars that happen.... 1000s of plastic 2x4 and 4x8 signs that end up in the city dump. So wasteful.
$C: You wanted to hear from actual politicians. I think voting is a way of expressing your stance on the matter.
$C: My friends step dad is the same way. Hardcore Trump supporter but he lives on disability and spends a large portion of his income on drones, yes, fucking toys. Meanwhile my friend has to give part of his paycheck to support his mom and stepdad. He's 18 btw and trying to save for college
$C: Actually, my preferred solution would be for the DOJ/FTC to grow a pair and start using the existing anti-trust law to break them up and force these ISP's to compete.  But that ship sailed back in 1996 when Bill Clinton [signed off on legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996) to allow the massive telecom mergers we see today, and simultaneously had the anti-trust regulators stand down from several enforcement cases against media consolidation.  Now the companies have thirty years of legal precedent that they can use to oppose any judicial enforcement action, so the change has to come either from the Congress or, ultimately, the people.  For that to overcome the normal bureaucratic inertia in Washington D.C., people will have to care a whole lot, and that means that just never happens outside some sort of hardship or pain.
$C: When you think about it though, considering what we've already tried to do in defense of net neutrality, this isn't the worst idea. Pretty much saying "it'll get worse before it gets better almost always sucks but it's not completely terrible.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I don’t “want” you to think anything, I’m just laying down truths, you’re just too angry and delusional to see it
$C: It's kinda hard to explain the pros of repeal without getting too technical so it's why 90% of the time, the explanation makes people lean towards maintaining NN.


$C: There's a certain feeling I encounter every so often on 4chan, where the level of irony and self-reference gets so deep that I'm not sure if the poster knows how much they are joking any more.

This is the first time I've encountered it on Reddit. I like it.
$C: Am conservative. Can’t confirm, Trump is an ass president.
$C: The thing is though, there are plenty of coservatives enthralled with what Trump has and hasn't done. So yeah, it looks awful from the left, but there's plenty of people celebrating what he's doing. That mostly doesn't apply to net neutrality, as 80% of everybody disapproves of what Congress passed a few months ago, but in general terms, many Republicans are perfectly safe in their house seats.
$C: We already knew this when he said he could do anything and they’d still suck his dick. They don’t care though, because they like being cucked.
$C: I honestly think we should revisit the whole secession thing.
$C: Trump hasn't done everything wrong.  The economy has seen a boost and hopefully we could see the debit going away.  Tbh I think net neutrality is a mess, sure it will help out ISPs but the internet is so valuable and net neutrality laws would simply just protect it.  My Dad is against net neutrality, apparently the "free market" will protect the internet cause if a isp blocks stuff then people will just stop paying them.  But we literally have one option for high-speed internet and I don't know what I'd do without it so even if half the sites are blocked I will still end up paying for internet.
$C: The hysteria is something else around here. 
$C: A simple search gives you news on multiple polls, all with very similar results. Here's just two: from [2014](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/11/12/wonkbook-polling-shows-even-republicans-overwhelmingly-support-net-neutrality/?utm_term=.4a5229c58b23) and [2017](http://thehill.com/policy/technology/364528-poll-83-percent-of-voters-support-keeping-fccs-net-neutrality-rules).
$C: No they won't. They will say "Well fuck, we tried so hard, but that asshole won't do it, guess we're fucked until we can try and vote him out" Then if they even manage to vote Trump out and get a dem in place, ISP's might have time to get a case together that says "These restrictions are unfairly targetting us and we're gonna lose a lot of money" and tie up any decent regulations for a little while until everyone forgets. If Trump get's a full 8 years, we can probably just forget Net Neutrality altogether.
$C: Yeah because people can never change their mind. I'm not saying that net neutrality will pass but until the actual no one can say for certain what will happen. 
$C: Really, I think the point here is you have no reason to be an ass about it. You have good points, but if we don't maintain some level of optimism when things go our way then nothing will ever change.
$C: I’m taking everything you say with a grain of salt because you lack maturity “sad ,pathetic , losers” you sound like trump and his rabid fan base. Stop projecting your insecurities onto other people and grow up. 
$C: That’s right keep calling others useful idiots while you take it in the ass and cry there’s no other way.

Sounds legit. Lmfao
$C: It's a fair prediction. If people want a change, they'll have to hope and participate as much as they can. It doesn't even matter which side you're on. Just because you lost one pawn doesn't mean you lost the whole game of chess.
$C: There is literally no awareness left to raise.  This was a massive thing when the FTC killed net neutrality and everyone who cares about it already knows, and those that don't care about it won't suddenly care now that they've had a vote in the senate that just barely passed.

The net neutrality talking point has zero bearing on trump voters and seemingly very little on swing voters.  It's just there to try to keep the democrat base angry about something.

>Shows that America cares.

This is the worst kind of useless feel-good sentiment.  It shows that some people in america want something, that's all.  There is no unified america on this issue.  roughly half voted the other way, and don't care about net neutrality.  net neutrality ended and they're still on the internet and thats ok with them.
$C: As a senator, McCain has one other senator from his state that, supposedly, speaks for the citizens of Arizona. They do still have a senator in the senate. If McCain was a representative in the house though, then they would be left without any local representatives
$C: It costs money to connect you to the internet. You must pay for that service. It's not complicated.

And if you want faster service, you pay more. Again, not complicated. 

It's pure Marxist garbage to demand something for a price you want, then get the government to make it law. 
$C: Speeds have gotten insanely faster all throughout my lifetime. I remember 15kbps.

Faster speeds happen automatically with the free market. History has proved that. 
$C: Cuz it's not a monopoly?
$C: Right, but the fact that it is taking too long is a result of the *upload* speed, not the *download* speed, which are measured separately. Your college considers the connection timed out because packets aren't being exchanged often enough; packets aren't being exchanged often enough because your upload speed is too slow. You could have 5 bazillion mbps download speed on both ends and that timeout would still happen if your upload speed is too low. 
$C: The owner of those dorms got to choose what kind of ISP to use. Also, are you saying you had not wireless there? 
$C: Yea I can't read. That's it. 
$C: Are you kidding? Trump has a favorable opinion of dreamers themselves. Just not Daca. DACA is a short term fix and Trump offered a compromise by giving amnesty to the dreamers in exchange for border security. That’s not a flip flop. That’s just being a reasonable person. 
$C: Add me to your list of those you wish death upon. 

Very radical, very sad. File this under “Another reason the Left is rapidly shrinking.”
$C: The tolerant left folks! Instead of having a discussion or answering questions they wish death and violence on others. You are one sick puppy. 
$C: That broken system's name? The Education system.
$C: How exactly is their platform disgusting? I'm the first to acknowledge that President Trump can be a bafoon but as far as policy goes he's done surprisingly well. Please explain in what way the republican platform is disgusting and the democratic platform isn't.
$C: then to answer your question it is a bill like any other and yes it can be vetoed. not that it will need to as this will never pass the house. 
$C: Unfortunately, net neutrality was a good thing that Obama was in favor of, and Trump is *very* consistent on being against anything good that Obama was in favor of.

In reference to what? Flint? If that’s the case then here’s an excerpt straight from fucking michigan.gov

- *For nearly two years Flint's water has been meeting federal standards. The water is now testing at 6 parts per billion (ppb) which is much lower than the federal requirement of 15 ppb. Flint's water is one of the most monitored and testing the same as similar cities across the state and country*

If in reference to the second part... it’s too late to post anything on that, and unless you want to go into post wars we can agree to disagree until tomorrow if you wish to resume it then.

Don’t try to demonize me by being black and white. “Blatant lies” my ass.
$C: Looks like Reddit is bent on keeping it then because I have yet to get any counter arguments.
$C: 1. The government is horrible at spending money wisely. How many people here would trust Trump and Congress with healthcare? When the same people go to anti-Trump protests and clamor about wanting government run healthcare it boggles my mind.

2. Without a personal stake in the issue healthcare facilities get overburdened with with both costs and patients. Look at how long it takes to be seen in Canada vs the US, and the costs over time for the NHS.

3. The US healthcare system provides the vast majority of new drug research due to it's private system that provides incentive to innovate. The reason why drugs are so expensive here isn't ebil pharma (though they are pretty sketchy for other reasons), it's the FDA.

4. I think that forcibly confiscating other's wealth is immoral.

5. Forcing people to support other's bad life habits is absolutely despicable.

6. I'd much rather have healthcare charity donations be tax deductible instead of forcing everyone to pay for a system that they don't support. But that would be too altruistic.
$C: And? My comment was a response to comment that said “everyone wants universal healthcare” that’s not true. I don’t know any middle or upper class people that want universal healthcare. That idea is mainly being spread by the Bernie Sanders supporters which are college students and college grads with degrees in gender studies who have 70k in student loan debt and no job. 
$C: Rather pay more taxes to healthcare than to dicey profit-motivated health insurance providers.
$C: Go ahead, link a place where they have universal healthcare.

The sides exist for a reason. If you still think that both sides are the same, then you don't understand what that reason is.

That's called being a sore loser.

So anyone that voted and supports Trump isn't a real American? Now that's the elitist delusion I was waiting to come out.

> Yes, that’s, right, I said *real* Americans. You have no right to complain. You’ve been calling yourselves the only real Americans for decades. 

You're quite a bigot. But such a dense one that you can't even fathom the idea that YOU are the one who's wrong. Also what do you mean by "yourselves"? You mean conservatives? Because correct me if I'm wrong but it's common knowledge by know that conservatives are the ones that support the constitution and founding fathers more so than any other group.
$C: Trumps approval rating at the moment is higher than Obama’s approval rating at midterms.

And this is with 24/7 negative news coverage. 

And with the booming job market, strong economy, substantial tax cuts across the board, and The prospect of Korean peace, it’s unlikely that his approval rating will drop further. 
$C: What speed you happen have is not what net neutrality is about. It's about equal access to resources. 
$C: That is not at all what this is about. Net neutrality/open internet is about how much control the ISPs have over what data is accessed NOT how quickly it is accessed.

Basically it's saying that your ISP cannot alter the flow of data to you based upon what you're accessing.
$C: When did he say that? Do you have a quote because I don't see it.
$C: You just said "That's not what it does." and then repeated my point...
$C: You’re making an ass of yourself over semantics
$C: Odd that you cannot dodge jury duty that could decide another person's fate but you can dodge voting for your leaders that would affect the entire nation. Just an observation.
$C: > Just because you're an active participant in politics, or are willing to vote voluntarily, doesn't mean you are "fanatic" or a "crazy".

Never said you were. Just that the fanatics/crazies have disproportional amount of power as they vote very consistently.

> Arguably, mandatory voting systems simply exacerbate the problem of uneducated voters, as people who could care less about politics are all-the-sudden incentivized to participate in an election that they have no background knowledge in. 

You are assuming uneducated voters abstain from voting by default. Not true - see the crazies.

You are also ignoring that apathetic voters might actually start educating themselves as they can no longer push the responsibility to someone else.

PS: Odd that you cannot dodge jury duty that could decide another person's fate but you can dodge voting for your leaders that would affect the entire nation.
$C: You can't buy marijuana for recreational use at this moment, no. It's not legal. Just because a politician talks about something, doesn't mean it's going to get done.

$C: Did you not just read my specific example? Im not rich. I didn't complain and demand that someone else I dont know give me money so that I can piss it away on a degree I dont need. Then flood the work force with overqualified workers and complain that I still cant get a job because now everyone applying for entry level jobs has a masters degree.

Or, I did my homework, noticed a trend for entitled millenials to get their diplomas and fight for the same handful of easy high paying managment jobs so I decided to save the money and teach myself to be a diesel mechanic which pays more in the long run and cant be outsourced.

No one needs to go to university and its ridiculous that you think I should pay for it.
$C: I could have gotten a loan. The reply was about college debt. I CHOSE to avoid the debt and instead taught myself a trade. This generation is demanding free college because they cant afford it. You dont need a college education to be successful if you work hard.
$C: There you go again considering conservatives republicans...

Im not Republican at all. Im actually closer to being a liberal but I will not elect someone willing to touch the 1st or 2nd or 4th.
$C: Good bot
$C: It's not government control over the internet, it's government control over ISPs. A small but important distinction. Net neutrality does not allow the government to filter the internet. Lack of it, however, allows ISPs to filter the internet.

$C: You are selling your 1st amendment rights under the delusion you will be able to get them back with your 2nd.
$C: thats not PC culture though, like you said, that is people using it to be hateful themselves. like its definitely far from politically correct to say gun owners masturbate to dead childrens’ corpses, right? 

while it is a sweeping generalization to say you can’t understand because you’re a cis white male, i think its more reasonable to say that because of your demographics, you may not totally understand certain issues or struggles that minorities face. and that’s not to demean you or anything, its just common sense that majorities tend to be unaware of certain aspects of life as a minority, and everyone falls victim to that. i’m a trans lesbian, so i have that perspective, but i’m also a white american, so i can’t assume i know much about the perspective of racial minorities. 

also its totally okay to not understand or ‘get’ other perspectives, like you don’t understand trans people. but it’s good to admit it, and i like to harbor understanding so if you have any questions at all about being transgender then i could try to shed some light on it

$C: No, dumbass. It's because we're tired of telling you fucking idiots things and then getting ignored "cause you're just a stupid librul lol"

people will start having conversations with you dumb yokels when you fucking idiots take even a small effort to listen to anyone else for once. In the meantime, it's wasted breath. Why ever bother? Everything I say will be disregarded anyway.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I'm simply highlighting that these companies don't care at all about neutrality.

When my understanding is that we already have an organization that will maintain net neutrality, why would I trust these non-neutral companies when they tell me we should shift net neutrality to a different agency? 

I think there are different motivations. Maybe even ones that hurt neutrality considering these companies are the worst examples for neutrality to date.

That opens the door to them deciding which is a burden and which isn't. Doesn't make sense to me if we're up for Open Internet



$C: You know what? This comment actually just made me realize something.

As idiotic as I think you are based on your comment history, at the end of the day, the two of us just want what we both consider to be best for our country. We may have different ideals and opinions on the best way to go about leading the country, and which paths it should take, but the two of us feel as strongly as we do *because* of how much we care about America.

We might not see eye to eye - you might think I'm a cuck, and I might think you're a dumbass, but there's still something kind of beautiful about the fact that we're two sides of the same coin - both of us only want what is best for the country, even if we don't agree on what defines that.

Cheers.
$C: I respect your opinion
$C: I'm not sure who told you that NN would make the Internet more expensive, but that certainly isn't true. I would suggest reading some liberal pieces on the effects of Net Neutrality, if only as a Devil's advocate way of looking at it.
$C: No, I'm claiming the isp should get to charge netflix more if they're trying to absorb an entire industry, not the same thing they would charge smaller players who are having trouble competing.
$C: Murder is banned it is against the law illegal same with weed it is illegal and people still use it and same with heroin or prostitution so how are those things different they are banned and people still do them most crimes committed with a gun are owned illegally and they still happend so please explain how banning guns will help stop a damn thing.Also explain why banning guns will work compared to the other things we have banned or tried to ban. Columbine happed during a ban and it didn't stop people from getting hurt the criminals still owned and used guns that were illegal to own.
$C: Can you give me proof of this that they are being paid off I would like to see  the article were you got this information a link would be appreciated. Also in case you didn't know most of the states that have the highest cost of living are liberals states same with most liberal states having higher debt and more taxes than Republican states so if I were to say who is in it for the money I believe the dems are.

$C: No one's going to explain anything to a shit shill throwaway when your only intent is to troll. You don't have the capacity for critical thought. Crawl back under your rock in the_donald.

$C: You are just a child, who gives a shit
$C: I agree that China and India should have to adhere to the agreement asap, but signing the agreement would have improved the administrations relations with Europe. Spending tax dollars to slow climate change is much better than spending it on building a big wall. The border problem is greatly exaggerated. 

The new tax bill gets rid of benefits for American workers and it doesn’t cut spending and will only increase national debt.

All I’m saying is there’s valid reason to dislike Trump’s policies. It’s not just people being triggered over things he said.
$C: What’s going on here
$C: and as you can see, despite my grammar being correct, the dumb fucking bot will correct me anyway even if you put your misspelled word in quotations. 
$C: ISPs are an oligopoly that haven't updated infrastructure in years because everyone knows that the moment someone does, it'll force everyone to *fucking gasp* upgrade their services to benefit the consumer like **every other developed country on the planet**.

ISPs restrict ISPs. If they didn't, we wouldn't have ISPs try to sue cities that have public broadband as their competition because they don't want anything to be upgraded.

NN is literally about forcing free market companies to be *free market*. I'm pretty libertarian, but the government is doing what it's supposed to be doing here, which is establishing a neutral zone to allow for competition and prevent oligopolizing. 

If you're going to call people twats, make sure you're not a moron first, yeah?
$C: Current ISP Infrastructure restricts ISP competition you fuck. Otherwise you'd have more than one god damned provider based on where you live. You want competition? You want these laws 
 that restrict competition removed? Hey, how about you don't have the ISPs lobby for laws that make it harder for competition in the first god damned place.


But I bet the kool-aid you drank was reaaaaaaal tasty, wasn't it. Get lost.
$C: I never said you did say anything about it. Read my last reply again. I'm the one making the comparison.
$C: [deleted]
$C: actually a center-right upset with the populist circus that’s taken over north america. 
$C: That's not how net neutrality works. you pay for a speed and then all the data is treated equally at that speed. there's no speed discrimination that you keep babbling on about
$C: You don’t know what data discrimination is.
$C: Sorry Captain, can't do that.  If you are too dumb to use google I can't dumb it down anymore. Well, maybe I could but I'm not going to spend my time trying to convince someone there are two sides to an issue.

I'm more than happy to spend my time telling people they are retards for thinking its "people vs power" and other bullshit like that. 
$C: "You could call an indie game developer a corporation"

And I could call your mom a whore.  Reality has nothing to do with what I call someone.  You would call an indie game developer a corporation if he, wait for it, *incorporated his business*!  reddit is a corporation you special needs individual. 
$C: That's true and would hold up if there was choice. Tons of smaller cities in the US have only one ISP, which could milk them infinitely without those regulations - they would have no choice. And since they won't be forced to share the lines with other ISPs, building any competition would be pretty much impossible there.
$C: All valid points, Net Neutrality changes ISP reqyuremebts from Title I Information Services, to Title II Broadcasting establishment.

Title II makes ISP's Responsible for content, and Therefore vulnerable to censorship. Think the Republicans wouldnt mind censoring some things?

The Uniparty in Washington, and the Infosec Giants are drooling over this.
$C: By raising our prices and restricting our internet? Doing a greaaaat job there.
$C: They are going to buy up web content companies, speed up their own stuff, and slow all their competition down because they know that entering the ISP market to compete (even in a small market) costs millions. AT&T is already looking to buy Time Warner. That consolidation is only the beginning. 

Why try hard to compete for a slightly higher market share in the ISP market, which already isn't very competitive, when you could instead abuse your market position to enter a new market with an unfair advantage over your competition there?
$C: Again, the lack of competition is a deliberate and mutual relationship by isps. They can maximize profits by agreeing to stay out of each other’s way. Thats why you see so many monopolies and duopolies for isps. As a consequence, isps could potentially throttle any internet traffic they want without repercussions. The only way to solve this problem is to force isps to compete with each other, which neither party will agree to do, or to use NN to force isps to play fair and not throttle traffic. Prices will still be ridiculously high, but at least the throttling issue would be solved. Its a hell of a lot easier to enact NN than to 
try and force large businesses to compete with each other. 

Edit: a sentence
$C: And the people who run said government are bought and owned by corporations. 


$C: > Why should I give my ISP the ability to regulate my internet

Why should I give the Government the ability to regulate my internet?

Just flip the question around and ask yourself why you trust the Government more than you trust your own ability to switch to another provider if they're being a dick. Competition keeps companies in line. They have an incentive to not fuck over their customers, because customers can leave and choose another ISP.

Seeing how quick you were to dismiss me over my post history, I'm going to assume you don't trust our current Government, correct? Yet you want to give them power over the Internet. It's nonsensical.
$C: [The old rules expire on June 11th.
](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-internet/fcc-says-net-neutrality-rules-will-end-on-june-11-idUSKBN1IB1UN)
$C: You're assuming that net neutrality is the only thing that voters base their voting decision on. It's not. If someone likes 98% of what the republicans do, and repealing NN is in the 2% of the things he or she dislikes, he or she will *still* vote republican. 

For many voters, democrats just don't represent them enough and republicans do. That doesn't mean that these voters support every single thing republicans do or fight for, however.

You can't expect people to change party just because of one thing. Certainly not in a dumb two-party system like the US has.





$C: It shows that the govt. As a whole is corrupt and stupid, no matter who's in power.
$C: Wtf, autocorrect? Could you do your damn job?
$C: 1. I never stated what your thought process was, I simply stated a fact. And that's a pretty small amount of people compared to... Oh idk just about any meme subreddit.

2. Yep. Yet Trump got elected. So... what? Democrats voted for him? I mean, what are you trying to disprove in my argument?

3. Have you not seen all of the comments on this post alone that say "Americaisdoomed?" Either way, I dont understand why you're still holding on to this part of the debate.
$C: >Do you think it's impossible for someone to understand net neutrality and still be against it?

Honestly, yes.  If this hypothetical person existed, they would be so out of touch with reality I'd wonder how they functioned in the real world.
$C: you are correct,cant believe the circlejerk
$C: Eh don’t worry about it. Politics is heated. Cheers!
$C: Not in most places, no you can't. ISPs have local monopolies. The biggest 4 have nearly identical pricing and policies. There's no choice there and you're limited by your geographic location. Your argument is not based in reality. 

Stop making this a partisan issue. It's not one. I'm not even a Democrat. 80% of us citizens after with this. It's mainly the Republican politicians that decided their donors matter more than the people.
$C: I'm at work, I'll get you the source on the Internet startup when I get home. 

As for natural competition, my point is that it's impossible for healthy competition to exist without government intervention. While I agree it *shouldn't* be necessary for the government to intervene, ISPs don't have a good track record when it comes to caring about their consumers. At some point, the consumer needs protection from predatory practices, which is what net neutrality is *supposed* to be. It's not the most elegant solution, probably, but it's something at least.
$C: E. Steps Taken to Minimize the Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities, and Significant Alternatives Considered
55. The Order clarifies and adopts certain incremental enhancements to the existing transparency rule, which was adopted in 2010, and will continue to require providers of broadband Internet access services to “publicly disclose accurate information regarding the network management practices, performance, and commercial terms of its broadband Internet access services sufficient for consumers to make informed choices regarding use of such services and for content, application, service, and device providers to develop, market, and maintain Internet offerings.”154 We summarize below the record keeping and reporting obligations of the accompanying Order. Additional information on each of these requirements can be found in the Order.  

165 See, e.g., ACA Comments at 32-39; Competitive Carrier Association (CCA) Comments at 8-9 (“Expanding the current disclosure requirements would also be particularly burdensome on smaller carriers); WISPA Comments at 15-16; WTA Comments at 8 (“WTA is very concerned about the increased costs and uncertain benefits of the proposed enhanced transparency requirements for smaller carriers and their customers.”); Letter from Erin P. Fitzgerald, Assistant Regulatory Counsel, Rural Wireless Association, Inc. to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, GN Docket Nos. 14-28 at 1 (filed Nov. 14, 2014) (RWA Nov. 14, 2014 Ex Parte Letter) (“While RWA members have developed procedures to comply with the Commission’s 2010 transparency and disclosure rules,[footnote omitted] engaging in a similar endeavor to comply with new and/or more stringent rules would be costly and further strain rural carriers’ limited resources.”); Letter from Stephen E. Coran, Counsel to the Wireless Internet Service Providers Association to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, GN Docket Nos. 14-28 at 8 (filed Feb. 3, 2015) (“To avoid the significant effects that would result from the Commission's proposed rules, the Commission should exempt small businesses from any new transparency and reporting obligations.”).

 See, e.g., Forty-Three Providers’ Feb 10, 2015 Ex Parte Letter at 2 (“[A]doption of the proposed enhanced transparency requirements, including . . . real-time congestion on our networks, could be significantly burdensome for providers of our size without providing any real benefit to edge providers or consumers.”); Charter Comments at 27 (“Because ISPs can monitor only a portion of the transmission path between a consumer and an edge provider, the information that could be collected would be of limited usefulness and inequitably burden the ISP relative to other potential sources of congestion.”); WISPA Reply at 9 (“Without question, small broadband providers would be forced to incur increased costs to comply with rules that would require multiple disclosures and detailed statements concerning congestion and reporting obligations.”); WTA Comments at 8 (“WTA is very concerned about the increased costs and uncertain benefits of the proposed enhanced transparency requirements for small carriers and their customers. For example, the monitoring and test equipment necessary to measure and report on a frequent or constant basis . . . latency, packet loss, packet corruption and/or jitter on a RLEC or other small provider's network can cost as much as the underlying data transmission equipment deployed to provide the broadband service.”).

171 See, e.g., ACA Feb. 13, 2015 Ex Parte Letter at 2 (expressing concern with “proposals to require detailed Open Internet disclosures tailored to the needs of edge providers and the lack of demonstrable benefits that would accrue from such reporting”); ACA Jan. 28, 2015Ex Parte Letter at 4 (explaining that disclosures tailored to edge providers “would require small ISPs, who manage their own networks and may only have a handful of network operators, engineers, and head end staff to make onerous expenditures of both personnel hours and financial resources”); Bright House Comments at 14 (questioning “the feasibility of creating disclosures tailored to the varied and potentially unique needs of the hundreds of such providers, particularly with no reciprocal obligation”).

170 See, e.g., Forty-Three Providers’ Feb 10, 2015 Ex Parte Letter at 2 (“[A]doption of the proposed enhanced transparency requirements, including . . . real-time congestion on our networks, could be significantly burdensome for providers of our size without providing any real benefit to edge providers or consumers.”); Charter Comments at 27 (“Because ISPs can monitor only a portion of the transmission path between a consumer and an edge provider, the information that could be collected would be of limited usefulness and inequitably burden the ISP relative to other potential sources of congestion.”); WISPA Reply at 9 (“Without question, small broadband providers would be forced to incur increased costs to comply with rules that would require multiple disclosures and detailed statements concerning congestion and reporting obligations.”);

$C: tl;dr; **I've implemented systems montoring these exact metrics at numerous software companies using off the shelf tools. don't talk shit or make claims about burdensome overregulation on topics you don't understand.**


did you even bother reading it?

most of this is exempting ISPs from certain reporting and granting small ISPs an exemption from what little reporting there is.

so which parts do you consider overly burden some?

the fact they need to publish a webpage explaining their networking management practices? oh no! 1 day of effort! so burden some!


the reporting of packet loss and latency within their network? You realize there are off the shelf tools for this, its a basic network monitoring practice. every software company that runs a website monitors their servers performance and has ways of reporting it. Not to mention, again, that small ISPs are exempt from this. so again SO BURDENSOME!


>Third, we require that providers directly notify end users if their particular use of a network will trigger a network practice, based on a user’s demand during more than the period of congestion, that is likely to have a significant impact on the end user’s use of the service. 

this one is easy to avoid, just don't implement network controls that are based on individual user behaviour, if you don't do this you don't need to report it to the user. and if your network controls are user behaviour based instead of congestion/bandwidth utilization based you're doing it to charge particular users more. I.E. throttling and data caps.

No small ISP is going to implement these types of controls as they take alot of work to implement for no gains from a network performance standpoint.



So basically all the reporting requirements are already in place at any ISPs because they are needed for network maintenance. and the ones that are not already in place at every ISP are only done to artificially throttle or cap particular users to get them to pay more.
$C: Yes, proud. 
$C: In today's world, yeah.

Regardless of my opinion, the law seems to treat them as such in many cases.
$C: This, 1000x this. For all we know NN will set some evil precedent 200 years in the future (/s), but with the way ISP's are currently operating in this country we are given no other choice but to keep their ass in line with regulatory measures. 
$C: I’m more of a conservative but think a totally free market is a pipe dream, and that it’s naive to think that it would work in reality. Some amount of regulation is good in many markets and necessary in some others. Finding the right balance to implement good and effective regulation that also doesn’t unnecessarily stifle the economy is the hard part. 
$C: 😂 You have to search pretty hard to find it on reddit. In fairness though, communication on social media is difficult. Text can be very tone deaf. Then there’s the larger issue of many people not looking for a discussion but simply wanting to give their own opinion and have it reinforced by like minded people instead of considering different ideas. That certainly happens everywhere, but it’s unfortunately very common all over reddit.

but the GOP have been acting like religious authortarians. torturing little boys so they wont turn gay.

$C: You've got management material written all over you! In addition, we'd like to offer 5 Reddit Gold per month. 
$C: I'm helping!
$C: You really think it will go a la carte? You wouldn't pay anything more. Companies like Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and Reddit would no longer get a free lunch. In this case it would be Reddit who would be forced to raise more funds or charge for various services. 
$C: Don't worry about that slippery slope. I'm sure Reddit and all corporations by extension have nothing but the best intentions for you.
$C: Only because they were better at it.
$C: A league that was more reluctant to use chemical weapons.
$C: More of a Breitbart/t_d thing to say honestly 
$C: Much appreciated haha

$C: There are quite a few people around who can gladly help with that problem. ;) 

Oh, and keeping with reddit tradition: /r/tildes
$C: Well, it looks a lot like reddit's early days with the defaults right now, but we've also got some old-school forum magic so that one of the content views works like a 'recent activity' so you can see threads that are still getting comments bumped to the top of the front page (which is your subscriptions, like reddit's home feature - there is no /all equivalent). 

We have threads 12 days old that still have a rather lively discussion going on (the one about solving the 'moderator' problem is awesome). So, I'd say on balance it's about as active as a small, young subreddit (which is not bad for 150 people total so far). Lots of topics, but overall reminds me of a cross between hackernews and /r/theoryofreddit with a little /r/listentothis sprinkled into the mix.

That's why the alpha is private. Once the activity level is higher (say a 50k subscriber subreddit) and there's a broader range of topics being discussed, it'll likely go open to anyone to read, though no posting without an invite. 
$C: Large communities is what ruined reddit (apart from the redesign).
$C: Reddit would almost certainly die overnight if they tried to implement a subscription-required service. The most they can really do is what they have done with Gold so far. 
$C: > Also, corporations cannot do anything to me without my permission.

You believe this because you're really *really* stupid, and you can't see all the ways in which corporations significantly influence your decision-making without being overt about it.

> A corporation can't tax me.

Taxes aren't a bad thing. Again, really *really* stupid.
$C: A wealthy corporation/industry can pour enough money into the political process to get your government to give tax breaks to the wealthy, thus increasing your tax burden because very profitable companies don't have to pay taxes when they offshore their profits but you still do. They can write legislation and get the members of Congress/state legislatures to pass it. [See ALEC](https://www.alecexposed.org/wiki/ALEC_Exposed). They can get Right to Work laws passed that make it difficult for workers to engage in collective bargaining. With their money they can influence politicians to the point that politicians put lobbiests in regulatory agencies who work for the industries they are supposed to regulate who then proceed to dismantle or not enforce the law (regulatory capture). I have no say whatsoever over what a corporation does but I can vote for or against politicians. 
$C: Do you grow your own food? Nope, looks like you need Kroger. Do you sew your own cloths? Nope, looks like you need jcpenny. You talk like the government has a gun to your head?! The government has literally invested in your saftey with police, firefighters and military members. This is VERY offensive to me, I am a future marine and you act like Walmart is better for the world than your government. The government can’t do anything it wants to you either. You need to read some things before acting like you know everything. The police cannot hold you for more than 48 hours without probably cause. You can’t convict someone of a crime without CIVILIANS on jury duty.
$C: >Also, corporations cannot do anything to me without my permission. A corporation can't tax me. A corporation can't arrest me. A corporation can't imprison me.

Why not? What is stopping them?
$C: I notice you didn’t mention public utilities, which is the closest comparison for the Internet.

Funny you bring up the postal service though, because Republicans deliberately sabotaged that: http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/07/nation/la-na-tt-postal-service-20130206

First things first buddy, yah that gloating you're doing? That's what Bush supporters were doing when the Iraq war was appearing to go well, and the market was at an all time high at that point just before the crash. You know, the gloating involved in leaders doing short term east actions with long term consequences.

Secondly:

GDP growth in 2017 was 2.3% 
GDP growth in 2016 was 1.6%

So you're either lying or brutally ignorant.

North Korea has already started canceling talks.

The Iran deal just gave them license to produce nuclear weapons.

Why do trump supporters need to lie in order to make him look good?
$C: So the national debt is the only indicator of the success of a party? In that case, then what about Bill Clinton? He eliminated the deficit, while presiding over the largest job growth in recent history. He did so by increasing taxes on the wealthy. The middle and lower classes prospered with him, and the wealthy certainly didn't suffer.

Maybe you should educate yourself on what the national debt even is. It's not so simple as the US taking out a loan.

Trump is a rapidly turning the U.S. into the butt of every joke. Please, if you think what he's doing is good for the country, neuter yourself.
$C: I think if he understood the processes better it would only make him more depressed, and nothing else would change
$C: Um... Hundreds of thousands of men and women do give there lives to defend this country and our liberties but I'm sure that they would be ok with me not believing in this backassward government where politicians vote one way or the other simply so they can keep their paychecks rolling in. If you watched the hearing with mark zuckerberg many of these men and women in government seats dont even understand what new technology today is or how it works. So why should I believe that they even understand our concerns about keeping net neutrality.
$C: Neither do I, just clarifying the timeline (or lack there of).
$C: Specifically because the new Congress takes their seats in January, so newly elected congressmen will not be able to vote on this
$C: I realise that, but I'm saying that neither extreme is the reality
$C: You aren't wrong.  But it won't pass the House anyway so he won't be asked to.
$C: Haha :(
$C: I understand where you're coming from, and I agree. I share your sentiment that this an important issue not to be cast off with some annoying comment. however, in THIS INSTANCE, I think this person was just connecting the dots between what other posters were saying (see above) and a well known, universally loved TV show...the post was on topic, and really just a simple call back to an unfunny blurb from a funny show. It was relevant given the context of the previous posts, and really nothing to get hung up on-in my opinion. 
$C: I don't even live in the US. I'm not apathetic by choice lol
$C: This folks, is an example of what happens when you embarrass yourself by talking out your ass and otherwise being clueless.

To avoid coming across as an ignorant know nothing, it behooves you to pay attention and actually research the differences and similarities of the two things you are trying to compare.

For example, if you think both party's are the same, the truth is...  That's fucking stupid and does not reflect reality in any way shape or form.

Hint: See the breakdown of the net neutrality vote that this FUCKING THREAD IS ABOUT!  DID YOU EVEN READ?
$C: This. The lesser of 2 evils argument bothers me deeply. Politics is filled with people in power, who are used to being in power,  and only interested in staying in power. What we need is accountability and ultimately that accountability has to come from the masses. We need to take responsibility for our government.
$C: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHA fuck off with your crocodile tears bitch, the Republicans fucking shit all over EVERY SINGLE attempt to reach across the aisle for EIGHT fucking years. Kindly fuck yourself, you reap what you sow

Trump is a literal fucking traitor. But Obama was BLACK and to most Republicans that's worse. 
$C: Do what you want dude I don't give a shit. Congratulations, you did the bare minimum necessary to not be considered a dumbass and a traitor by not voting for the dumbass traitor party.
$C: Why aren't you that demanding Republicans don't support torture? Based on these numbers, if the entire Senate was Democrat, Haspel would not be confirmed at all!  She'd lose 87 - 13, which would be a crazy sweep. Not to mention, it's a Republican nominating her in the first place!

It's like getting a papercut on your left hand while your right hand got chopped clean off. You'd have to be an ignorant fool to think that the papercut is the problem you should be worrying about.

You have a fundamental inability to understand where the actual problem lies if you're unwilling to admit that Haspel's nomination is largely Republican-caused. 
$C: > I'll admit I waiver from the party when it comes to the EPA because I think breathing clean air is a natural born right and corporations who ruin that are infringing on others rights, and on net neutrality because our internet network is a somewhat government created Monopoly

Which is pretty much the hole in the entire ideology, though. Let the market sort itself out like in the days of the robber Barons, who became incredibly dominant and easily took over all of the markets forcing out all competition! Like, you're getting the cracks in the ideology right. The thing is it actually applies to all of it. 
$C: Here's a crazy thought. We got together and voted on some things like regulations to stop monopolies that exploit workers and crowd out innovation. Shouldn't we be able to enforce those laws because we voted on them?
$C: Non\-right\-wing Libertarianism has some decent ideals, but a serious disconnect with reality. Every libertarian I know has a really poor understanding of systems and processes, and every libertarian I've known that has eventually developed a good understanding of systems and processes has stopped being a libertarian. They've still got a lot of the same values and ideals, but they've realized that libertarianism, as a political philosophy, is simple not a practical, pragmatic, or even possible way of pursuing them.

Right wing libertarians are actually the more traditional type, and they tend to favour autocracies and monarchies and child slavery and private militaries and all sorts of shit that basically comes down to "the powerful should be able to do whatever they want and the rest should do what they are told", so its easy to see how they'd get along with the alt\-right and fascists in general.
$C: It's because libertarian was originally a synonym for anarchist (The far left kind). Back in late 19th century France it was forbidden to spread anarchist literature, so anarchists dodged the rules by publishing their papers and books under the label of libertarian. Ever since libertarian has meant anarchist in most of Europe.

Only in the 60's did the american right wing hijack the term.
$C: It's because it's the US, term 'Liberal' has been in recent decades coopted by  other ideologies, mainly progressives and statists, both of which espouse some very un-liberal values or methodologies.
$C: To be fair, most libertarians disagree with most of the fundamental tenants of libertarianism. One of the defining features of the modern libertarian is grotesque ignorance and an intentional lack of understanding, both of their own proclaimed philosophy and of how the world itself functions. There's not much else that actually holds them together \- most of them are borderline evangelicals but they've replaced god with personal selfishness.
$C: It wouldn't lead to anarchy, it would lead to corporate oligarchy
$C: Who regulates ownership?
$C: Then what do you call authoritarian socialists? xD
$C: >Because libertarian ideology is actually vile.

Fair enough. What's your reasons?
>
>Libertarians booed a candidate off stage for agreeing that it probably should remain illegal to sell heroin to children.

Please remember that many if not most libertarians are not affiliated with the Party. Many libertarians I know don't even like the party.
>
>Libertarians believe poor people deserve to starve to death.

This is just insane. You might believe libertarian policy or lack thereof would lead to more starving people, but libertarians do not want anyone to starve. Charitable giving and economic oppurtunity are cornerstones of the belief system.
>
>Libertarians believe that they should not be beholden to any law in their pursuit of profit.

Completely untrue. Libertarians believe in laws and are fully opposed to crony capatilism.
>
>Libertarians believe it should be legal to run a child brothel.

Again, where is the evidence. This is absurd.
>
>And yes, libertarians believe you should be able to arbitrarily restrict internet access if it means you could make more money.

This is less crazy, but many believe the government shouldn't be involved much with regulating the internet period. Not for profits but overreach into the economy/privacy.

Nothing wrong with disagreeing with libertarians, but you have a huge misunderstanding of what it is. Libertarians and even anarchist libertarians are not for a lawless mad max society.

$C: 3 people mean nothing

Talk to me when it starts spreading
$C: Parent comment
$C: One thing that wasn't mentioned in response to the "establish(ment) of the necessary infrastructure" is that the telecom companies (who bought out and took over the ISPs to become the companies we know today) fleeced the government out of hundreds of billions in grants and tax breaks in order to "upgrade" the entire country to fibre networks (which were then to be shared by any ISP who wished to create a competitive market).

In the end they did nothing for close to 25 years and are only recently, and still very slowly, rolling out actual fiber even major metropolitan areas.

This thread is a pretty good ELI5 of the situation.

https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/6c5e97/eli5_how_were_isps_able_to_pocket_the_200_billion/
$C: I didn’t say that at all. I’m telling you both sides were shilled. That’s a fact. Most of the sub is also fairly left leaning echo chambers that self censor with downvotes. 

My point still stands. I’d love to be told I’m wrong about the bills linked below. I’d love to be told, with proof, that the new NN has none of the shortfalls of the last one. 


$C: Your first post leads to links that not only define a narrow range of weapons being targeted for a "ban" (as opposed to a gun ban, which you initially stated". It also links to defining what qualifies as an "assault weapon" quite specifically, oddly enough, despite your claims that no one can do such an impossible task.

Your second point blames "the media", as if that's some monolithic beast to be contained, but, worse yet, it merely links to a video showing how fast and powerful a bullet can be coming from an AR-15 weapon system as opposed to...what? Another comparison of how an AR-15 fires? Seriously...it's just a retired military general firing a rifle. It adds up to approximately nothing at fucking all. 

2.5 is addressed by my first point, which is that you have no clue what you're defining as an 'assault rifle', or to your larger point, a "gun ban" is, and you claim that no one else can define it, despite the fact that your own link leads to a definition of that very fuckin thing.

3. You truly believe that the founding fathers meant for the constitution to be an unchangeable, set-in-stone document? You think that they set all this in motion without any forethought of what's to come? So you think we should live with impermeable laws set forth by a bunch of kids 200 years ago without any prospect for change?
$C: At this point it's synonymous with Communism which is synonymous with bad for a large chunk of the country. That's literally the depth of their knowledge 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Republican Americans do. 
$C: So you agree with the post you replied to originally, got it. Usually the word "or" means you're offering an alternative viewpoint, you were just agreeing. 
$C: So when trump wasn't president and he made fun of a disabled reporter was that rude? He wasn't the leader of the united states then. https://www.thedailybeast.com/kathy-griffin-takes-back-trump-apology-on-the-view-fuck-him . That is also very public and addressed to him so is that rude?
$C: to date I have gotten 244 cute hate pics and 42 hat pics. 
$C: The errors which arise from the absence of facts are far more numerous and more durable than those which result from unsound reasoning respecting true data.
-Charles Babbage
$C: The data is literally right there on the website. Not being in the US I've little motivation to put in the time to spoon feed people who'd rather downvote any counterargument and circlejerk instead.
$C: Your assumptions about TiA made that pretty clear already, point being that when people get desperate they try to go after the person rather than the argument. The OP featured here is deliberately pushing an agenda, which is something people should be aware of.
$C: > No, it's not suggesting that people do their own research and find their own data, it's in the way you word things. It's in the way you SPEAK, which is even more terrifying. 

Good god this is just delusional.

> The Republican Party knows how to deliver propaganda SO well, and all it takes is a couple of sound bites clipped JUST so, and a few headlines and a couple comments. They literally concoct giant shitstorms of ACTUAL fake news. 

Yes, US politics revolves around manipulating perception and interpretation, such as by selectively presenting vote results to push an agenda. This isn't hard to understand.
$C: I used to be a lot like Piglett, believing half the country was either plain stupid or just evil. But as I grew up and finally broke out of my echo chamber I realized how stupid I had been the entire time, somehow I was arrogant enough to dismiss half the country as idiots. Now I'm a right-leaning liberterian. 
$C: It wasn't even military aircraft. The bill clearly states 'civilian aircraft'.
$C: > Oh you're a clown trying to ignore context, aren't you?

Actually I was hoping that someone like yourself would raise this. We're looking at objectionable voting after all.

> Be deported if you're suspected, with no proof? Fuck that, no wonder they didn't vote Yea.

I intentionally chose examples which have an explanation behind them. You're right that context is important here. We have to look a *why* people voted down a bill, otherwise you can get the wrong impression. Posting huge lists with bill titles, as OP did, doesn't give a complete picture of the different stances on each issue. The Republicans aren't simply malicious freedom-haters looking to screw everyone over.

That also doesn't change that people make opposition arguments for the sake of partisanship. There are always dodgy explanations behind representatives opposing a bill.

> You're a moron. You failed in cherry-picking against the Democrats because the truth is the Republicans are that fucking bad.

All you've established here is that cherry-picking is unfair. If you're so delusional that you really think that just the "other party" are a problem then you seriously need to get off Reddit more. Screeching and hurling abuse isn't helping you here.
$C: > It clearly says civilian aircraft, not military aircraft - "Requires the Treasury Department to report to Congress on the Iranian government’s financing of civilian aircraft purchases (Sec. 3)."

Ah yes, my mistake. I've corrected that.

Anyway, see my comment above. I largely chose these examples because there's a clear context involved. In a similar manner there are genuine reasons for politicians to oppose a lot of the stuff in lists like OP's. Titles of bills are famously misleading and so rage-bait lists such as this just aren't helpful.

But either way, you can come up with some bullshit reason to vote for or against any bill. People aren't actively malicious and that's simply not appreciated by those that'd rather circlejerk about how bad a party is. Y'all need a system with more than two viable parties.
$C: [See this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8jzyb6/update_we_won_the_net_neutrality_vote_in_the/dz4esun/).

A similar post pushing the other agenda probably does exist somewhere, but it'll never see the light of day on subs like this because people vote in a partisan manner. Anything breaking the circlejerk tends to get downvote-suppressed.
$C: Okay, but it’s not like McConnell specifically designated those two as his “no” votes (I understand that that’s not quite what you’re saying, but let me elaborate). Collins and Murkowski don’t exactly care about what GOP leadership thinks of them. They’re both incredibly moderate and often a thorn in McConnell’s side (see: the ACA vote). Sure, maybe McConnell wasn’t too worried about losing their votes because he could afford to, but it’s not like he has them under his thumb. If that was the case, the ACA would be dead at the moment. And once again, if the no votes were a means of political strategy, it’s not very smart political strategy. A multi-term incumbent moderate politician (aka both Collins and Murkowski) isnt the kind of politician who’s seat is often in jeopardy. Dean Heller voting no would’ve been a much smarter political move if that was the case.
$C: More people don't care about Trump being president than anyone else.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I’m also illiterate, forgive me
$C: You're giving reasons why you like living in your state. So it's fair to assume that the three things you mentioned are among the most important reasons. 

Therefore, you having access to guns is very important to you. That speaks volumes.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Eh, I'm publicly open about my views. I just know that some people are going to call me the devil for my views (I wish I were exaggerating) My biggest problem is both sides utterly refuse to admit to their bad parts. Though I admit, I pretty much have been voting single party recently because the things I believe in have only been on one side so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
$C: Said the person who thinks Libertarianism is racist.

Coming up next: "10 innocuous things that are now racist, thanks to my convoluted and politically motivated re-definition of the word, you won't BELIEVE number 6!".
$C: This is the kind of nonsense that caused me to abandon the left.

I'm a John Locke kind of classical liberal, not a Karl Marx kind of socialist liberal. That means I don't like all this virtue signalling progressive cultural Marxist shit. People in this thread are talking about T_D lacking fact based reasoning but honestly it's the modern left who have departed reality and gone to fucking Narnia. They seem to live in an alternate universe where Jim Crow is still a thing, the KKK have switched parties to the Republicans, and there are neo-nazis and lynch mobs at every corner of every town.

I actually like some stuff that Trump has done, brokering peace with Korea, bringing jobs back to America... for fuck sake they've re-opened steel mills, since when does the west RE-OPEN steel mills!?

But I'm not allowed to be happy about that, because politics in America has become like sports, where people will refuse to give any praise to the opposing team because they've invested so much ego in their team.
$C: Shut up, you frickin banana!
$C: Mmkay. I want you to go up to someone of African American decent and ask them if they watch the "Chocolate News Network", and then report back to me if that worked out well.
$C: TIL slurs are okay as long as they're not directed at someone WHOSE generations, not that person itself mind you, suffered more than others....
$C: Ditto for yours XD

Not saying I disagree, mind, but you haven't backed anything up. Even so I find it kind of hilarious watching people argue against you when all you've given them is a hollow stump of potential truth.
$C: Why is that? Because you think that literally all other news agencies are out to get the virtuous Republicans, rather than see how *just maybe* Fox News and the less than reputable "conservative" blogs might just be full of propaganda meant to distract, and not inform?

How's that list coming along?  Or are you just gonna deflect some more?
$C: Ya you're just so much smarter than everyone else. That's why none of us get it.
$C: Defense to what?

$C: Oh I know, I live in CA, am friends with many liberals. We're all just people, with different experiences just going through the motions. 
$C: Awesome pics. Great size. Look thick. Solid. Tight. Keep us all posted on your continued progress with any new progress pics or vid clips. Show us what you got man. Wanna see how freakn' huge, solid, thick and tight you can get. Thanks for the motivation.

Heh, I actually [look like that](https://i.imgur.com/StF7fec.jpg) minus the roids.


$C: Talking a lot of shit for [someone who uses](https://snoopsnoo.com/u/readythespaghetti#corpus-stats) less than half the number of unique words [as I do](https://snoopsnoo.com/u/ebilgenius#corpus-stats). 

You also seem to have an insanely unhealthy obsession with Trump, considering the absolutely [insane frequency](https://snoopsnoo.com/u/readythespaghetti#common-words) with which you use his name. 

You literally use it more than twice as much as any other word lol.

tbh [your entire "word frequency" table](https://snoopsnoo.com/u/readythespaghetti#common-words) is just sad. Goes to show how little of a vocabulary you actually use.
$C: You didn't invite me to share the "pros/cons". You only asked for the cons, with the obvious sarcastic implication that there are no cons.

If I'm wrong, you could prove it by posting the cons yourself in an unbiased manner.
$C: [Thank you!](https://youtu.be/J---aiyznGQ) 
$C: Ah yes, the waste that comes from a year of heavy electing. And interesting to hear about the political landscape of Newfoundland.

Coincidental enough, my family is from Newfoundland! They were in Torbay about 4-5 generations ago haha Small world for Newfies!
$C: >You wanted to hear from actual politicians. 

Nope.

> I think voting is a way of expressing your stance on the matter.

The matter is the reasoning behind the vote, not the vote itself.
$C: It's pretty weird the amount of rural trump voters who receive government assistance but also inversely are *against* the very assistance they receive for others. 
$C:  Yup, I know people that are conservative solely because they don't agree with helping anyone else out. What's theirs is theirs. 
$C: **Telecommunications Act of 1996**

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 was the first significant overhaul of telecommunications law in more than sixty years, amending the Communications Act of 1934. The Act, signed by President Bill Clinton, represented a major change in American telecommunication law, since it was the first time that the Internet was included in broadcasting and spectrum allotment. One of the most controversial titles was Title 3 ("Cable Services"), which allowed for media cross-ownership. According to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the goal of the law was to "let anyone enter any communications business – to let any communications business compete in any market against any other." The legislation's primary goal was deregulation of the converging broadcasting and telecommunications markets.

$C: The problem is that it assumes things will get better. That's not a given. They could easily just get worse and then keep being worse. And then later maybe get even worse than that, because we've allowed the situation to become the new normal.
$C: Well, in MY opinion, your neckbeard is better than Valentina.
$C: You. I like you.
$C: Oh my fucking God did you just say we could see the debit go away?!? Lmfao! Do you know how frivolous this man is with spending? He's already spent more on traveling than Obama did in 8 years, he's ramping up the military budget, and he's giving tax breaks to billionaires who should be taxed at 90% like they were under Eisenhower, a Republican, in the most economically-prosperous time in this country's history. The facts are not on Donald's side.

Also, who gives a fuck about helping ISPs? What fucking help do they need being multi-billion-dollar companies? This corporate welfare disgusts me and it should disgust anyone who complains about democratic-socialism because at least the people under democratic-socialism who receive aid actually need it. Mega corporations don't need tax breaks or government subsidies, they have enough money and should not be compensated for taking a risk like every other human being does.
$C: Keep fighting the good fight you useful idiot 
$C: “Stop reminding me of the truth REEEEEEEE”


$C: I feel like I’m in a salt mine right now. So much salt 
$C: In this issue it was checkmate like a year ago, no losing a pawn. I wish I could bet money on this, at least monetize people’s stupid blind optimism 
$C: Thanks trash collector!  
$C: So they don't have some sort of suppleant system? I never considered it, but parliament members in my country all have a suppleant that steps in in where the member is not able to, usually sickness, births or resigns from their seat (suppleant holding the seat until next election). Usually the suppleant is runner up from the same party from that area, to ensure your seat isn't suddenly an ideological opponent and the voters still have a say of who gets in there. 

It works in the way that the suppleant will in case of temporary unavailability pretty much just be a puppet of the actual MP and will take over more in their own right if it's a permanent vacancy. Technically they don't have to listen to the actual MP on the temporary timeframe, but it's considered bad form not to and will probably lead you to trouble with the rest of the party.
$C: Thanks for the explanation. I'm an Australian, so I wasn't aware of the other senator. Cheers.
$C: Lmao that’s not how Marxism works. Stop throwing out buzzwords. 
$C: It costs money to deliver water, electricity and oil to our homes. The few big players doing so are heavily regulated against price gouging their customers, doesn’t mean they’re not profitable. 
$C: No it hasn't. It has proven the opposite. There are several countries with much, much higher internet speeds than ours for lower prices. The free market is not the driving force behind internet technology, and American internet speeds are not competitive. 
$C: They are measured separately, but at speeds that low, it is usually equal. The connection can support the same speed both ways. The only reason upload is smaller than download past 10mb/s is because we are throttled by our ISPs.
$C: >As well as the apartments I lived offsite on.

Yes, VT had their own private network, no it didn't extend to the corner dormitories or to private housing.

What part of the whole town only had comcast don't you understand?
$C: Changing your position back and forth inside the same day while giving a speech isn't flip flopping?

$C: Drug policy, ruining the lives of non-violent drug users.

Also the current issue, selling out the Internet to ISPs.
$C: I don't know about that... The "Muslim Ban" was a list of countries created by the Obama Administration so he might say eff it and put his name on it.
$C: Okay, this service is always expensive.

The infrastructure cost is high, the towers required are high - it's just an expensive service to maintain.

I work in IT and constantly deal with fiber links, wireless and have stuff spread between Canada and Spain and two Canadian provinces and Whitehorse/Yukon...

I can guarantee to you, even if ISPs and providers charge Google a billion a year to ride on their pipe - they're not going to lower your rare unless there are "other" companies that want to steal their slice for the pie for less margin.

Not trying to be a douche to you but in both countries, service providers are there to make money, and the only solution to lowering rates is to have a ton of healthy decentralized competition... Which both countries don't have.
$C: Yeah I am in China. But China's government never said they were a democracy. And America is obviously still the most free country (except for drugs?) but they also have promoted and claimed to be very pro democracy in the past and so I find it ironic that such a law as the one mentioned above can exist. By the way, in China social harmony is valued very highly, so giving everyone the freedom to do what they want (like having  guns) is not seen as a necessarily good thing. To argue that one system is better than another is an entirely different discussion, and it's clear that American style freedom comes with its costs

$C: Well, students taught him about Climate Change, call and talk to him and see if you can teach him about [Net Neutrality](http://kutv.com/news/local/ut-rep-curtis-to-tackle-fcc-and-net-neutrality). If you have the time, try and teach him about why we shouldn't destroy Bears Ears and to listen to the inter-tribal coalition rather than the oil and gas industry. Your voice counts!
$C: We’ll work to get him replaced in November.

$C: Wow, so edgy. Fuck off with your wannabe Nazism
$C:  The Michigan Gov who was blatantly lying about Flint since day one and caused this shit?
$C: 1. I agree that the government is bad at spending money. So let's at least put that money towards something that is good for people and our country. 

2. Healthcare can get overburdened everywhere. However if you put just a quarter of the workforce that's currently working on over billing you, to work on helping you and each other I think you can lighten the overall load. 

3. I can see your point but I think pharmaceutical corporations would adjust and the work and research would continue. 

4. The money is already being taken via taxes and over spent and mis managed. We would simply be directing that money where needed. 

5. If you have national healthcare there's more ability for the masses to get preventative care and avoid emergencies and complications. They're also less likely to have lifelong poor health choices if they're seeing a doctor on a regular basis. 

6. We're already forcing people to pay for things they don't necessarily believe in. Example; war and destruction. Put just a fraction of that money towards the betterment of the society you live in. 
$C: Lot of "Middle Class" people are just one bad day away from the poor house and they know it, fam.
$C: How many Americans do you believe have a gender studies degree?
$C: So does Europe have an immigration problem or not?
$C: Plenty of people can barely afford their insurance. And when it comes time to use it (especially in an emergency or major operation), they will still have to pay way more than they can afford out of pocket. Especially since lower monthly costs (which is all some people can afford) means higher deductibles. No one should have to go into debt because of a visit to the hospital, but people do.

Basically every other first world country has some form of Universal Healthcare, but their rich are getting along just fine.

To be willing to sacrifice the well being and sometimes lives of others to make a few more dollars is evil, no matter how you spin it.
$C: Something something a square is a rectangle but a rectangle is not always a square. 
$C: It’s a Constitution Republic, we elect our representatives using democracy. 
$C: I didn't say that

Both sides have idiots but both sides have good qualities too, I just don't think it's smart to write off one side as evil
$C: lmao

Ok so I'm not allowed to use the phrase "both sides" anymore are you serious
$C: Hide behind the facade, excellent. 
$C: > Because correct me if I'm wrong but it's common knowledge by know that conservatives are the ones that support the constitution and founding fathers more so than any other group.

So much for the anti-elitist right.
$C: > Trumps approval rating at the moment is higher than Obama’s approval rating at midterms.

That is untrue.  In fact, Obama's approval rating [has never been as low as Trump's is now] (https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?ex_cid=rrpromo)

Trump's approval rating is the highest it's been in a year, and it's still pretty abysmal.  
$C: [deleted]
$C: I agree. Except in the sense I'm against mandatory jury duty. Especially with the current ways they do it. I'm also against the draft. All of these examples are examples of forced labor, which is slavery.
$C: Do you understand how laws work? Once one is made it takes time for it to take effect thats the exact scenario were in at the moment. You cant right now but by next month(if i remember correctly) you will be able to(if you meet the requirements).
$C: Yeah but you're enabling the Democrats to do the awful stuff by supporting them over these relatively minor differences.
$C: Then you are lost.
$C: [deleted]
$C: so if the state wasn’t corrupt, you wouldn’t have conservative ideals? then its just sensible to become a progressive 
$C: You seem to think that you're the only person who pays taxes. 
$C: >I could have gotten a loan. The reply was about college debt. I CHOSE to avoid the debt and instead taught myself a trade.

The world can't work if everyone just teaches themselves trades. Without places where people dedicate years to study and research, we wouldn't have many of the amenities you enjoy today. You'd be hard-pressed to find self-taught accountants or economists, for instance.

>This generation is demanding free college because they cant afford it.

We're demanding _affordable_ college because it would be better for everyone if more people were able to be educated. Would you have gone to school if you could do it cheap?

>You dont need a college education to be successful if you work hard.

That's such a blatant lie. Without a degree, how exactly are you supposed to compete on resumes with people who have them? Are you supposed to use the experience you don't have because you haven't had a job in your field yet?

Really, all this boils down to is that you and your party don't care enough about other Americans to pay even a little so that they can have a better life, when they would do the same for you.
$C: In the US, conservatives are interchangeable with Republicans. If you’re voting for conservative Democrats, great, we agree. If you’re voting for Republicans who call themselves conservatives, you should really look at the policies that they pass.
$C: How about any of the amendments? Or are those three special for some reason?
$C: I get messed up, stupid school saying I before E, except after C. Got me misspelling shit all over the place.
$C: I'm not selling any of my rights. Just because I vote pro-gun doesn't mean I'm selling my rights. The 2nd Ensures the 1st. The 2nd ensures Self Defence, and Self Reliance. Not to mention that it's debatable about whether or not Net Neutrality, or the Absence of it, is a violation of the 1st. I feel that it would be a hard thing to argue, because it wouldn't be government mandated, which is what the 1st protects from. Companies can block you and what you look at or say on thier ground. Trust me, I don't agree with what the Republicans are voting for on NN, but to call it a violation of the 1st is absurd.
$C: I know, correlation isn't causation, but it is often a good excuse to look closer.  The timing could be coincidental, but it seems less likely than the bombers suddenly discovering they hadn't gotten away with it.
$C: Your, childish, impotent rage and ad hominem attacks leaves me to believe you've been caught with your pants down in regards to knowing absolutely nothing about positions you closely cling to.

>people will start having conversations with you dumb yokels 

I've lived in large urban areas my entire life and hold an advanced degree.
$C: > If smallvideohost.com and Netflix.com have resources in the same DC, Netflix will clog the pipes and harm the UX for smallvideohost.com. 

That's not how this works though, I had the experience of working at massive startup data-center and Netflix would have multiple dedicated circuits which they would expand on as their use required. They wouldn't be "clogging the pipes" with their dedicated fiber and backbone providers have their own role and requirements to business as well.

This isn't residential cable hosting netflix via dyndns in dad's basement.

If a DC is having issues with its customers affecting clients that's another issue and the market has other options. Nobody has to be throttled, everyone pays for the service they require and ultimately your services performance, your design and infrastructure dictates your product. Why are we even having this discussion in 2018? 
$C: >The sensible thing is force Netflix to the negotiating table and make them pay for the disproportionate amount of bandwidth they use. Or make them pay for their own dedicated pipes. And if the ISP and Netflix can't come to an agreement, the ISP has no legal requirement to serve them.

Why is that sensible?  Because you said so?  Your entire argument is bass-ackwards.  And who the hell gilded this drivel?

Netflix isn't using bandwidth.  The ISP's customers are using the bandwidth they payed for.  Those same customers are also limited both in speed and likely monthly usage already.  Why the hell does it matter if they choose to use their allotment on netflix or whogivesashitvideo.com?  ISP's are so damn desperate to pretend they're not just a dumb pipe to the internet its pathetic.

$C: [deleted]
$C: Sorry, but you either have not thought this through enough or don't know what you're taking about.

I can assure you that ISPs aren't strapped for cash, and they will nickle-and-dime consumers regardless of how much their services cost. The idea that these poor ISPs can't afford to provide internet service without being able to extract more money from consumers is ridiculous. Net neutrality doesn't cost ISPs money, they haven't even really taken advantage of the lack of it, ([though they have tried](https://np.reddit.com/r/KeepOurNetFree/comments/7ej1nd/fcc_unveils_its_plan_to_repeal_net_neutrality/dq5hlwd/?sh=45a33b81&st=JAA62V5F)). 

The largest barrier to new ISPs is not the "price" or net neutrality, it is the lobbying and anti-competitive practices ISPs employ to stop new competion (such as Google Fiber).

The idea that Netflix is responsible for the large bandwidth usage is silly. Users pay for what they use, so what if they use for Netflix than other sites? Why would it be their responsibility? Plus, if all sites are treated equally, Netflix doesn't "clog the pipes", the other host can use just as much as them.

On top of that, your arguing that forcing sites to negotiate with ISPs mean that they will "pay their fair share", but what it will really lead to is ISPs taking advantage of their power to stifle competion. Let's use your example. Say your ISP has its own streaming service, Webfilms. Unfortunately, Netflix is already popular with their users. So, your ISP throttles Netflix's connection while giving great service to Webfilms.

The idea that ISPs are some benevolent organizations that seek to give everyone their "fair share" is ridiculous. Your opinion is based on a fundamental misrepresentation of how it actually works. Users using Netflix don't harm specific websites more than others. There is far more preventing competition than consumer protection laws. Net neutrality doesn't cost ISPs money, it just prevents a possible revenue stream from censorship and anti-competitive practices. 
$C: >Content providers aren't "on your side", you've simply been duped to be a pawn in someone else's politics. 

Honestly, they could have a mission statement that's just the sentence "find our customers and punch them in the nuts until they turn black and fall off" and I'd still support them over Comcast.
$C: You’re on fire 
$C: That's exactly why I think we should fragment any sort of control over such a thing and  not give it only to the government or to solely private interest.  It's a matter of keeping people in check, not government or the private sector, both of which have equal potential for corruption and manipulation in my opinion 
$C: You probably misread while scrolling bud, I didn't edit.  You replied like 3 minutes after my comment; there would've been an asterisk.


$C: I would imagine there's a lot of throwaway accounts for sure, but it's kind of justified. We've all seen some genius dig through a post history and come back with "You post on T_D, you're an idiot and wrong as a result", ruining any discussion.

I could see people using alts to avoid that.
$C: Why do you hate commas? 
$C: Burdens for complying with regulation is a far reach from "right to remove bad users". The burdens are not talking about content; they're about accountability and reporting as far as I can tell. I don't think the slippery slope is justified. 
$C: The fact you judge someone on their beliefs shows you’re a massive bigot. Sorry but the left does not want what’s best for the country. Anyone with eyes can see that. I’m not gonna assume that of you. I’m not gonna stalk your comments like some fucking loser. This comment proves you’re not a cuck. Just misguided. All I know is that law and order, border security and our constitution are all under attack right now. As a member of the army the protection and safety of this country is all that concerns me. 

Cheers mate. 
$C: >  liberal pieces

I have, and this shouldn't really be a partisan issue. I try to stay objective (when it matters). It will get more expensive because there will be no motivation for content providers to keep file sizes down. The burden will be passed to the ISP's, which will have no qualms about passing it on to you. At the very least expect data caps similar to those your cell provider has.

 On top of this they will be losing TV subscribers by being forced to allow the competition use their infrastructure for free. They will also pass this loss on to you. Imagine if back in the Dish Network could just force the cable companies to distribute their programming instead of launching a satellite to broadcast it. They are actually [doing this now](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/06/business/media/dish-network-announces-web-based-pay-tv-offering.html).

There is no denying the internet has already gotten more expensive since net neutrality originally passed. The honest question is if they will bring prices back down if it is repealed.
$C: ahh misread your initial post.

And yes, it isn't like these peering agreements are secrets. You can download the standard ones from most ISPs - the problem is Netflix doesn't want to peer, they want to have a one way street.

$C: Yeah and it needs to be regulated to prevent companies from gaining too much power... are you missing the point here?
$C: That's absolute bunk dude, the only way I compared you to the left was in your tactics of smearing anyone who doesn't agree with you. Though, tbh, you prolly have more in common with the left than you do with a libertarian capitalist like me. It is cute though, you keep availing yourself of those leftwing tactics while steadfastly denying being anything like them. Perhaps, while true right wing is nothing like the left, perhaps it's the alt right that fits that horseshoe model?
$C: Or you are a dumbass who as no basis to stand on so you are going to mentally shut down when you get challenged you are a sheep.

$C: I'm just going to assume that you completely don't understand what a straw man is, but that's okay. 

Who said I hold a stance on electric neutrality. Why did you assume that I wanted to debate about it? I'm just trying to understand why you threw that out there. Making the comparison between what? NN and EN? Cause uhhhh, no one asked for that.
$C: You had me until the Jews part. 
$C: Nice troll. Lol. 


A liberal that hates Jews. Bahaha 
$C: I do not post on r/the_donald and I never have.  You’re a liar.  

What’s wrong with liking Jewish People?  I don’t know what that’s supposed to mean.  You sound anti-Semitic 

Edit.  Major typo.  
$C: You're a Canadian liberal pothead.

r/quityourbullshit
$C: Yes it is.  You also can not have ANY bundled access to services like Netflix i.e. T Mobile offering free Netflix that doesn't encroach on your data plan.

This all boils down to 'data discrimination' which is not just something I am "babbling about" but the idea that a packet of data on a network is to be treated the same regardless of origin, destination, or speed at which it is to be contractually delivered.  This is a problem for tiered networks as they use the same hardware and network to transmit data at different speeds.  This is also an issue for data transmission prioritization on mobile networks.

This is especially an issue for Netflix and Amazon with their data pipeline services as they continue to eat up more and more resources, but don't want to pay for the increased share of bandwidth they consume.  They want their data to be treated the same as someone who pays a premium for priority transmission.  With Net Neutrality, that practice is justifiable when different hardware is involved, but can not be justified when all the involved factors except plan speed are the same.  Net Neutrality will make it so that you as a consumer can not have a different data speed than your neighbor regardless of your data needs.  It is all or nothing.  The fear is that companies will slow down traffic of controversial or less wealthy clients, but in reality it is the government that will slow everyone down instead.

In short, it is a solution looking for a problem instead of what needs to be done, which is making the internet a utility.
$C: Sure.
$C: Lmao. You are what’s wrong with this country. 
$C: Bit angry there
$C: Just gonna drop this

>B. Promoting Investment with a Modern Title II

>37. Today, our forbearance approach results in over 700 codified rules being inapplicable, a “light-touch” approach for the use of Title II. This includes no unbundling of last-mile facilities, no tariffing, no rate regulation, and no cost accounting rules, which results in a carefully tailored application of only those Title II provisions found to directly further the public interest in an open Internet and more, better, and open broadband. Nor will our actions result in the imposition of any new federal taxes or fees; the ability of states to impose fees on broadband is already limited by the congressional Internet tax 
moratorium. 

>38. This is Title II tailored for the 21st Century. Unlike the application of Title II to 
incumbent wireline companies in the 20th Century, a swath of utility-style provisions (including tariffing) will not be applied. Indeed, there will be fewer sections of Title II applied than have been applied to Commercial Mobile Radio Service (CMRS), where Congress expressly required the application of Sections 201, 202, and 208, and permitted the Commission to forbear from others. In fact, Title II has never been applied in such a focused way.

> 39. History demonstrates that this careful approach to the use of Title II will not impede 
investment. First, mobile voice services have been regulated under a similar light-touch Title II approach since 1994 — and investment and usage boomed. For example, between 1993 and 2009 (while voice was the primary driver of mobile revenues), the mobile industry invested more than $271 billion in building out networks, during a time in which industry revenues increased by 1300 percent and  subscribership grew over 1600 percent.30  Moreover, more recently, Verizon Wireless has invested tens of billions of dollars in deploying mobile wireless services since being subject to the 700 MHz C Block open access rules, which overlap in significant parts with the open Internet rules we adopt today.But that is not all. Today, key provisions of Title II apply to certain enterprise broadband services that AT&T has described as “the epicenter of the broadband investment” the Commission seeks to promote.Title II has been maintained by more than 1000 rural local exchange carriers that have chosen to offer their DSL and 
fiber broadband services as common carrier offerings. And, of course, wireline DSL was regulated as a common-carrier service until 2005—including a period in the late ‘90s and the first five years of this century that saw the highest levels of wireline broadband infrastructure investment to date.

> 40. In any event, recent events have demonstrated that our rules will not disrupt capital markets or investment. Following recent discussions of the potential application of Title II to consumer broadband, investment analysts have issued reports concluding that Title II with appropriate forbearance is unlikely to alter broadband provider conduct or have any negative effect on their value or future 
profitability. Executives from large broadband providers have also repeatedly represented to investors that the prospect of regulatory action will not influence their investment strategies or long-term profitability; indeed, Sprint has gone so far to say that it “does not believe that a light touch application of Title II, including appropriate forbearance, would harm the continued investment in, and deployment of, 
mobile broadband services.” Finally, the recent AWS auction, conducted under the prospect of Title II regulation, generated bids (net of bidding credits) of more than $41 billion—further demonstrating that robust investment is not inconsistent with a light-touch Title II regime.
$C: Which Title II are we talking?

Because the 2015 Net Neutral Order  specifically states that the old Title II is inapplicable in many ways so it came with a modern approach to compensate.

So this is NOT the 1934 Title II that everyone complains about
$C: You’re saying that as if they have already done it. You don’t have the slightest clue as to what companies would do. They don’t want to lose your business. If all companies were to slow down all websites and everything or even put it behind a package another company would come in and steal all of their customers. Capitalism 101. 
$C: This is just capitalism in a nutshell it’s almost as if you think everything should be fair in this world. Im sorry but life is just not fair. If you want a country that is fair/doesn’t have capitalism I heard Russia is great this time of year. 
$C: And yet it's the government, not corporation, in the most powerful position in the USA.
$C: You cant leave one isp and go to another. I live in the city limits of a metropolitan, I have one option for ISP. My situation isnt rare.
$C: > Government control

There's your problem.

The FCC is an *Independent Agency* of the government. 

While YES they are appointed by the government, the government holds no sway over their decisions. The chairpersons are staggered so that way no president can truely sweep the board AND the Congress must approve of POTUS decisions.

Meaning that the agency itself is just like any normal company (equally susceptible to corruption as well).

Next up you also assume that ISP's will WILLINGLY let new ISP's shore up.

Kind of hard when it's the [entrenched ISP's you're fighting](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/one-big-reason-we-lack-internet-competition-starting-an-isp-is-really-hard/) instead of the market demand itself.

Everyone always talks about political incumbents being so hard to remove, now imagine if your incumbent politician could lawsuit the up and comer because he's advertising in his area. 

Hell, it's great if you have multiple ISP's in the same area. Those people would MASSIVELY benefit from this bill. However, a good amount of Americans (reported numbers vary, but a good average is 25% for 1 isp choice only, another 30% for only two) is going to MASSIVELY suffer. Not going into the fact that these ~55% are usually in low income areas that just couldn't afford an Internet bill that matches their TV.

Overall it has good and bad points, but the good points are for the people in high income, multichoice areas while the bad are for the low income areas. Essentially making a bad situation even worse.

If you would want to have NN removed the monopoly of ISPs needs to go.
$C: > You're assuming that net neutrality is the only thing that voters base their voting decision on. 

No, I'm not. I'm not saying anything even sort of like that.

What I'm saying is that they should take responsibility for the consequences of their actions. Don't vote Republican and then pretend that it doesn't hurt net neutrality.
$C: Lol right. 
$C: Lol, twice in a row.  But I get it, typing fast on mobile, when the Reddit app doesn't give you red squiggly lines, kinda sucks.
$C: 2. Your whole point was that you know a lot of republicans who are pro net neutrality. So do i. I was not attacking republicans thats my point. You originally suggested i was making a blanket ststement which i was not. So i said basically, "im not talk about republicans or conservatives im talking about trumps base." Who may not be those things. Thats my point. 

3. Im still debating this point because no, i dont think americans are awake enough to the danger we all face. 
$C: I think one of several issues I would raise with that is that many people advocate completely disentangling government manipulation of the industry's market. Net neutrality only really makes sense in the context of what are often government created monopolies that can't in any way be considered natural.

Now, you could obviously make the argument that, as long as the government keeps the market regulated in such a way that these monopolies are kept in place, they should also regulate them heavily so as not to start a fire and then let it burn uncontrolled, but even if you argued for that, you could still say that there is a reasonable position that advocates for the eventual elimination of net neutrality regulation, albeit with radical reformation of the market on the whole.
$C: >Not in most places, no you can't. ISPs have local monopolies.

As opposed to global monopolies, which are clearly better.

"If you don't like being banned and blacklisted by Silicon Valley just move to the non\-existent country where a their competitors are more popular."

>Stop making this a partisan issue. It's not one. I'm not even a Democrat. 80&#37; of us citizens after with this.

Says the guy who accused me of "hate speech" for being opposed to a law that claims to make the internet neutral but just helps companies like Facebook and Twitter turn us into the Soviet Union more easily by requiring ISPs to charge "equal rates" for "equal bandwidth", saving them millions or billions.

At least make an attempt to argue honestly with me, dude. And the downvotes are also really telling.
$C: I suppose, but then the legislation needs to be tailored to meet that criteria. Like I mentioned earlier I would be onboard if the goal was to foster free market principles but as history has shown the charlatans are lurking behind the curtain. Politics seems to always poison the well and since our political landscape is so fractured its hard to extract the true intentions of the legislation. I am skeptical as you can tell and I worry that because the name of the legislation is so cleverly titled it will mislead the general public. That's why I mentioned the Dodds Frank Act because that led to a greater disparity between small and larger banks which is the direct opposite of its goal. Government doesn't have a great track record of fixing issues but they do have great record of exacerbating them. By the way I appreciate your civility and candor in this discussion. It makes disagreements more palatable.  
$C: Hey, woopwoopskadoop, just a quick heads-up:  
**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.  
Have a nice day!

$C: 🙄
$C: It completely is, and it's insanity that people insist eliminating most/all regulation is a good idea. The whole reason regulations exist in the first place is because of historical abuses by companies that forced them, and companies would do the same again if given the chance. The "free market" only works when all customers are fully informed about all their choices and massive corporations that own significant portions of the market share don't exist. Even then it's very reactive instead of proactive. That's all impossible in a fast-paced global market like exists now. 

Trying to undo that pandora's box would more or less mean going back to a more agrarian, robber baron 1800's style civilization. As much as some people might like the idea of (some of) that it's not happening and not possible, it would probably require killing off at least half of the world's population, and it would be generally horrible for everybody.

$C: Lmfao,  my mistake [it was the second one](https://i.imgur.com/Pm2CDWm.png)

Anyway, I'm not gonna gloat too hard, good luck in fantasy land.
$C: The more time we give to the Dems the more they're gonna use their power to stay in power. They are not good for the country and anyone convincing you that the GOP are pure evil and the Democrats are the good guys is either one of those "good guys" or they've bought the bullshit too. Dems were for invading Iraq. Dems embraced the War on Drugs when it started and have refused to get with the times in regards to marijuana (have you seen them make any move to legalize it without taking some pussy-ass half-measure that keeps it more or less illegal while making it easier to get a hold of? What good is it if you still can't smoke and be at ease knowing you won't get thrown in jail for it? It's not really solving the problem.) They claim to be all for ending sexual assault and gender-based violence and there's just about as many of them raping and assaulting women as their GOP counterparts. They claim to be for homosexual rights but didn't do a goddamn thing when Obama was in office and had the House and Senate controlled by Democrats. They didn't change shit while that was going on.

They say they want change but the status quo keeps them rich, which is why they never change it.
$C: Deal! And if anyone else wants the position tell them I'll do it for only 4 gold a month! 
$C: Me too, thanks. 
$C: If you have the Reddit app you'd know they're already trying to raise funds. Haven't you seen the ads? They're a for profit corporation. And no company gets "a free lunch". Want to stick it to them? If you actually support a capitalist system and aren't just spouting anti-corporate gibberish, you'd understand the way to take down companies you don't like is to organize a mass boycott campaign to get them to change their ways. 

I don't know if a la carte is the correct terminology, as that would imply individual services, but I was referring more to broadcast television services, wherein you purchase your services in bundles. For instance at the extreme of a Net Neutrality repeal, you would purchase a basic plan for simple text site access, then you would purchase premium plans for social media (FB, Twitter, Reddit), streaming media (Hulu, Netflix, YouTube), music (Spotify, Pandora, Slacker), etc. I believe this because it's exactly what happened due to loose regulations on broadcast TV.
$C: One would be naive to think there wouldn't be a trickle down effect. Ultimately costing the end users.
$C: In a word? Yes. Yes it will go 'A La Carte' and that's not just fear mongering. There is precident for it. New Zealand lost Net Neutrality a few months. But don't take my word for it. Here's the link to Vodafone New Zealand. 

[https://www.vodafone.co.nz/pass/](https://www.vodafone.co.nz/pass/)

And if you don't think that the companies that charge you a lease on the equipment you \*must\* get from them to use their service are not going to charge you for using Netflix or Hulu, you're the one that's dreaming. 
$C: Uh, you mean the guy whose name is synonymous with gas chambers? Assad is at worst Saddam-level bad, and neither of them even register compare to the Western players.

My bad, misread it.  
Still, the mail has spent the last two years calling Corbyn and Labour anti-Semitic/racist/literally anything else they can think of to smear him
$C: Okay, are there *medium-sized* communities?  Is that better?  And no there aren't, because it has 150 users  right now.
$C: > You believe this because you're really really stupid, and you can't see all the ways in which corporations significantly influence your decision-making without being overt about it.

Sure they can influence. But they can't compel. 

>Taxes aren't a bad thing. Again, really really stupid.

I never said they were bad. I said that corporations can't tax me. They can't arrest me, or jail me or execute me. 

If they want my money, they can't just take it. They must convince me to give it to them instead of their competitor. 

Does the government give me a choice? 

No. 

Just admit it. Don't create another strawman. Just admit the facts. 
$C: > A wealthy corporation/industry can pour enough money into the political process to get your government to give tax breaks to the wealthy

If you have a small government, then lobbying is worthless and pointless, because the government isn't regulating or taxing you in the first place.

>They can get Right to Work laws passed that make it difficult for workers to engage in collective bargaining.

...Are you kidding? You think it's "good" when workers are compelled under force of law to pay for an union that they want no part of? And those unions are always incorporated. 

So forcing workers *by force* to pay money *they do not want to pay* fees to a private corporation is a good example of a benevolent government to you. You believe that. You genuinely believe that. 
$C: > Do you grow your own food? 

Yes. But not all of it. 

>Nope, looks like you need Kroger.

No I don't. I can go to Safeway. Or Walmart. Or a local supermarket. 

>Do you sew your own cloths? Nope, looks like you need jcpenny.

No I don't. I have Amazon. Ross. Literally thousands upon thousands of online stores. 

>You talk like the government has a gun to your head?! The government has literally invested in your saftey with police, firefighters and military members. This is VERY offensive to me, I am a future marine 

Marines are trained to kill and carry guns. They act as agents or the government. Police are a better example, though. When acting as an agent of the government, they may legally arrest me, and take me to jail. 

Corporations may do no such thing. They have no legal power to do any of that. 

>and you act like Walmart is better for the world than your government. 

They probably do. 

>The police cannot hold you for more than 48 hours without probably cause. 

Corporations can't do it for *less* than 48 hours. 
$C: The government is. Because the government is infinitely more powerful. 
$C: Except that the internet isn’t a utility, so that doesn’t make sense. LOL @ blaming Republicans. It’s their fault Obamacare is underwater too right? What, did they plant pennies on the rails of Amtrak?
$C: I get the process up to the point where I'm just tired of hearing about our shity bipartisan government going back and fourth like little children because they don't have the capacity to comprimise. Love the country. Hate the government.

Edit : good bot
$C: >  If you watched the hearing with mark zuckerberg many of these men and women in government seats dont even understand what new technology today is or how it works.

...yes, that is one of my points. Net Neutrality *gives those people control over the internet*. Why would the news that NN is doomed bother you unless you are so ignorant that you have the issue completely flipped in your head? And yes, those people would be disgusted if that is the case. 
$C: Lol. Accuse me of not reading and you're arguing a point I never made......

Look in the mirror
$C: Right. And when someone supports someone who does awful stuff because they do one or two things you approve of, you're signing off on all the awful.

Both parties know there's no reason to balance the budget for example because they're just using our grandchildrens money to buy votes now
$C: Here we go, the lib is crying to me. Lmao.
$C: What are you even talking about? What drugs are you on? 
$C: >Why aren't you that demanding Republicans don't support torture?

Because frankly the GOP is a lost cause and completely unresponsive to average Americans, whereas the Democrats are at least slightly more responsive and therefore have a better chance of actually changing. 

>You have a fundamental inability to understand where the actual problem lies if you're unwilling to admit that Haspel's nomination is largely Republican-caused.

If the Dems have the ability to block Haspel and they don't, part of the blame absolutely lies with them and you'd be a hack to say otherwise.
$C: Thank you. Anybody with an ounce of knowledge about the Nash equilibrium, the tragedy of the commons, network externalities etc would immediately understand why we need a government. No, the free market cannot punish companies for looking out for themselves and automatically fix things. Government is the thumb on the scale to generate outcomes that are better for the common good.
$C: For the most part you can't really stop monopolies on things that depend on massive infrastructure. Utilities tend towards natural monopolies because it's the only cost effect way. Running 20 lines of electricity, 20 lines of cable or fiber, 20 sewer pipes, and 20 water pipes to every house in the country isn't possible. It only works with limited options which is why utilities all need to be heavily regulated, municipal, or a semi-public combination of the two. It just doesn't work any other way.

$C: I can see how that would be true and I'm still exploring a lot in politics so I'm sure my views may drastically change. I actually just took my first political science class and that alone changed a lot of my ideals. 

At present moment my main internal conflict is freedom vs regulation, and I tend to lean more strongly towards freedom. 
$C: I agree that's a much much bigger risk that they seem to never have a real answer for. How would the press and education systems prevent corporate interests from running the country on every level? PR campaigns already trick people into having misconceptions about the companies they deal with; how would millions of "average consumers" even know who needs to be kept in check? 

Its a problem we've already seen when the ultra rich ran the industrial revolution, I don't get how true libertarians think that wouldn't just happen again on a gigantic scale. 
$C: In an anarchist system: Nobody, there is no ownership outside things you can personally lay claim to.

In a libertarian system: Either a state, or a 'private security firm' that for all intents and purposes acts like a state.
$C: Tankies is the most common term I think that means them and exclusively them.
$C: So what ridiculous redefinition of "libertarianism" are we using today?

>You might believe libertarian policy or lack thereof would lead to more starving people, but libertarians do not want anyone to starve. Charitable giving and economic oppurtunity are cornerstones of the belief system.

Hahaha. Libertarians want to abolish all welfare. Libertarians believe that if you starve to death without welfare you deserve it. Libertarians claim that communism is impossible due to the inherent selfishness of man, yet claim in a welfare-less tax-less system the poor would be fine because of man's generous nature.

Tell me, if you were not required to pay taxes how much of your income would you volunteer? Would it be much less than is currently required to sustain society and the less fortunate? Would you maybe skip giving altogether some months because you wanted to save up for something? Would you maybe forget entirely after a while because everything seems to be running fine for a short time without your contributions? After all, you're not required to give anything at all.

What sort of economic opportunities are you referring to for the neediest? The ability to sell themselves into slavery? To sell their own organs perhaps? Because in a libertarian society where there is no federally mandated minimum wage or working conditions, employers are not going to be hiring more workers for higher wages in better conditions, that is a fact. Because those things cost money.

What is to stop them charging exorbitant rates for utilities such as water? After all they *own* the water supply in a given area. That's a core tenet of libertarianism is it not? Natural resources belong to whomever claims them, and as they are not beholden to any governing standards body it's no one's business how much they charge or how safe to drink the water is. 

>Completely untrue. Libertarians believe in laws and are fully opposed to crony capatilism.

Libertarians believe in two laws. Ownership and the NAP. Everything else is fair game. Libertarians are so stupid they can't even agree if it's against the NAP to enforce the NAP or not. Libertarians are so stupid they can't understand that unregulated capitalism *will by definition always lead to crony capitalism* due to the concentration of wealth and therefore power.

>Again, where is the evidence. This is absurd.

Libertarians believe that business should not be regulated, the sex industry should be legal, and that if a child "consents" they should be allowed to work in that industry. Because after all, like all common sense laws, age of consent laws have no place in libertopia where laws regulating choice=governmental aggression.

>This is less crazy, but many believe the government shouldn't be involved much with regulating the internet period. Not for profits but overreach into the economy

"Overreach into the economy" is a euphemism for "interfering with profiteering".
$C: Need to start somewhere. If none support your cause = SHIT, if some do = SHIT. No pleasing you is there?

$C: Thank you for posting that
$C: >George Soros

Nice meme dude. There's your rebuttal.
$C: Exactly true. Like, 100%. I had someone tell me the other day that they'd never vote for Bernie Sanders even if he did run in 2020 because he's Communist. I actually laughed SUPER loud, and then asked them to repeat that statement for me. 

They repeated it. I stared at them incredulously for like I swear an entire minute, then just got up and left. LoL. 

I'm just like, I can't with America anymore. Like I really, truly, cannot. 
$C: “Knowing how to play the game” is such vapid rhetorical bullshit, honestly. Clinton likely would have been able to do even less than second-term Obama, given that she was one of the biggest and easiest political targets in the country and she would still be dealing with a Republican-controlled Congress. 

And given who the Clintons (and Democrats as a whole) are, I wouldn’t expect them to oppose net neutrality, but I definitely wouldn’t hold my breath on them ever putting their neck out for half of the issues that they ostensibly care so much about
$C: > I'm still proud of my vote.

Proud of voting for Trump? Yeah you're a certified moron.
$C: Republicans voted against the views of their constituents, but I'm saying there is a bigger issue in government where representatives vote along party lines far too often rather than what it means for who they represent.

I guess, even if net neutrality gets reinstated (which I desperately want), it may never be secure if our elected representatives never care about the people who actually elected them. 
$C: Nah, because he fucked her life up for a year out of spite. He made it so she lost a YEAR'S worth of income. All for a stupid little prank online. He has BOASTED about sexually harassing women and getting away with it, and he's been in the public eye for a LONG TIME HONEY!! He didn't just pop up over night! He's been around long enough for wise people to know, he's a nasty man, to borrow one of his phrases. He is THE nasty man, now. A#1.

$C: > If you're so delusional that you really think that just the "other party" are a problem then you seriously need to get off Reddit more

Nah, I'll pass on the "both parties are the same" idea because it's bullshit.
$C: Really? Limiting and disclosing corporate donations to a politician's campaign is a bad thing?

Backup Paper ballots to as verification against voter machine hacking?

Dodd-Frank? Because financial institutions are so good at regulating themselves to make sure they don't wreck the entire American economy.

And of course, Net Neutrality. The reason why this is even a thing is because in the past, ISPs have been caught red handed abusing bandwidth limits in order to favor or punish different companies and consumers. Net Neutrality prevents abuses like this.

As I was once taught - The role of government is to correct what natural free-market forces would not. An excellent example of this is the Clean Water Act, or the Clean Air Act. 
$C: We can still see something even if it's downvoted
$C: >  Collins and Murkowski don’t exactly care about what GOP leadership thinks of them. They’re both incredibly moderate and often a thorn in McConnell’s side (see: the ACA vote). 

you cant be moderate and republican. if they were moderate, they should call themselves independent. The country shift right.

as a thorn, they are hardly noticeable. 


$C: refute something i've said.

$C: I'm not going to claim all that. 

I'm just not under the illusion that the far left is a lot more on-the-ball than the far right. It's extremism on both sides. I've seen plenty of misinformation, lack of reason, hypocrisy & general nastiness, etc. from people on the left. I'm generally left on most issues, but I try to avoid confining myself to echo chambers and fall back to reason & moderation whenever possible.

$C: Confirmed troll , you add nothing of value to the discussion. 
$C: A similar system is in place here. The issue in McCain's case is this: If he resigns now, the governor of his state appoints a Republican to his seat, and a special election is held for his seat next November. If he waits until June (I think), the appointee gets to hold the seat for two years.

The reason this is hugely important is that Republican control of the Senate is currently threatened in the next election. There are about a half dozen highly contested Senate seats, and if the Democrats win all but one of them, they gain control. If McCain's seat is up for special election, then it's a highly contested seat, and the Democrats can afford one more loss elsewhere if they get his seat. This is even more an issue because the other Senate seat in Arizona is already up for an election, with no incumbent (Jeff Flake retiring). If both seats are open, with no incumbent in either, the campaigning by the Democrats will be absolutely off the charts. And Republicans won't do well if there's a record-shattering GOTV campaign in that state.

tl:dr McCain is delaying his resignation to improve the odds that the Republicans maintain control of the Senate for the next two years. 
$C: I think we all saw how well that works in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, when Representative  Binks  moved to give the chancellor more emergency powers.

$C: When did he ever change his position on the issue. He made a compromise and democrats turned it down. End of story. 
$C: So asking you to support your statement is asking too much? This is why the political discourse is the way it is now. You'll call the opposing perspective disgusting without anything to support the statement and when asked why you believe that you answer with that. It shouldn't be difficult to back a belief with why you believe it.

$C: 1. Agreed the government is bad at spending money, so let's give them control over our healthcare! ... Did I infer that wrong?

2. Care to elaborate? 

3. Then why is most of the research in the US instead of in Europe if they could adjust?

4. The money is being mismanaged by the government. Therefore we need to give more money to the government and put them in charge of another facility, so that it won't be mismanaged... I'm not following the logic here.

5. Why should we pay for a glutton's third heart replacement or alcoholic's 4th liver surgery? If there are no personal consequences to fucking yourself up people will freeload.  

6. The government is already violating my beliefs, so we might as well let them go the full mile!
$C: Can you read?
$C: The United States is a federal democratic republic.

It is *federal* because broad powers and some degree of autonomy are reserved to regional governments.

It is *democratic* because political decisions are made by either the people or their elected representatives.

It is *a republic* because its government claims to derive its legitimacy from the consent of the governed.

It’s also “constitutional”, but there’s no such thing as a non-constitutional republic, so that doesn’t really add much.

Therefore “the United States is a republic, not a democracy,” is a silly thing to say.
$C: > Both sides have idiots but both sides have good qualities too

This is a wonderful, non-Republican sentiment, but I don't see much grounding in material reality.

*What* good qualities do "both sides" have? What part of the Republican way of life do you find admirable?
$C: Very ridiculous comment. How can you even compare the sides? Republicans aren’t nearly as bad as the democrats. Not even close. 
$C: Dead serious.

Trying to make the left and right in America seem the "same" when the president who is a right winger defends neo-Nazis deserves to be called out.
$C: Am I wrong though? The only group that I see proudly defending and supporting the constitution/found fathers is conservatives. The talks of repealing constitutional amendments always come from the left and liberals. It's not an elitist mindset.
$C: For the same reason your electric company can't charge you more if you use a Samsung TV rather than an LG TV.

Terrible Prime Minister... Then again, Stephen Harper wasn't much better but he was the lesser of two evils.
$C: They say it's temp but I'm sure it won't be. Peoplebwill complain so hard that the next candidate will need to keep the cuts in place to win.
$C: I understand that it isnt just me paying into it but the cost of paying to educate everyone weather they need it or not is astronomical. I understand free education to the high school level. That's a pretty good foundation for a trade level job. If someone else wants to pursue a career in a higher field with the assumption they will make more money then let them invest by taking out a loan. Then the "rich can pay for the education" after the fact. If you want to go without debt then have an employer pay for it, enlist, be a police officer.

You want to take away the choice of every citizen just to fund your own dream. Social security fell apart and I'm not paying in because there wont be any left to pay out. In taking my own retirement into my own hands because then it's my fault if it doesn't work out, not the government.
$C: You wouldn't need to compete on a resume if the competition didn't all have a degree. The bachelor degree is the new high school diploma because it is obtainable by the masses throu college loans. The degrees are expensive because they are becoming more complex. Proffesors are demanding higher wages because they simply know more and studied more than they did 50 years ago.

I also understand and agree that some proffesions are going to require a degree but people make it sound like it's a requirement to hold any career that pays more than minimum wage. A lawyer does not need a degree, they just need to pass the bar. An electrician or plumber just need a license. A mechanic (yours truly) just needs ASE certification. Sure the expensive paper helps give you an edge in an interview but the government doesn't need to subsidize your education when the market is already flooded with way too many graduates where the jobs I already listed are understaffed. If everyone was a lawyer or a doctor the world would shut down.
$C: I vote on both sides locally
$C: Those are the three most commonly attacked. Nobody wants to toss out the 7th

$C: We only have to talk about net neutrality because government abuse has resulted in monopolies. I don't trust the government now, nor indefinitely, to not corrupt their net neutrality rules.

Break up, or at least don't enable, the monopolies. There is no other option. Anything else will be further corrupted down the road. I'm especially wary now that I see all these non-neutral parties pushing it.

I want net neutrality, absolutely, but it's almost guaranteed to get worse with more government intervention. Government intervention is why we're here at all, they have necessitate their existence. Too many of the problems they seek to resolve are created by them.

The fuck are you on about? republicans have all three branches. They've created their own crises.
$C: The amusing part is that if US consumers were more receptive of data caps, your ISP's wouldn't have to go down the path of charging content providers for their excessive network traffic

Here in Australia we have to pay for data, and the only talk about NN is what is seen on reddit

We also have the "doomsday" scenario where you pay for access to a particular service, just with extra steps. It's possible to sign up with an ISP and have a low data cap, but they don't count your data towards select services like facebook/youtube/netflix/whatever

It's not the exact scenario that is used to instil fear as in the US NN debate, but it's damn close, and consumers eat it up
$C: Good bot

Okay, I explained the how in my post as to why NN is needed. Why don't you go on ahead and explain how losses are pushed to the consumer? Could you also explain how losses are generated through NN?
$C: The laws that they fucking lobbied for, dumbass. What, you think they're going to have a change of heart suddenly? Jesus fucking Christ.

"Hey man! Net Neutrality is reaaaaaally stopping us from competing with other ISPs because of all these laws we asked for! We reaaally want competition! What the fuck do you mean using existing infrastructure to allow competing ISPs to start up in my area. THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOCIALISM TO ME!"
$C: I'm just going to assume you're retarded.
$C: so quick to judge. i didn’t deny any of that? can’t act like i’m surprised though. your hero is a hair-trigger twitter addict.  i have to say that i love you basically reinforce the stereotype of a TD poster with essentially zero effort. 
$C: The tiered speeds will not go away no matter how many times you want to try to parrott that as an anti NN talking point. Data discrimination deals with filtering or blocking certain kinds of data. It does not force ISPs to offer one speed of internet.

It’s honestly dumb because the Net Neutrality bills that are trying to be passed wouldn’t change the internet as it is now. But apparently Net Neutrality is going to make it illegal for ISPs to offer different speeds? That’s bullshit 
$C: Really? lmao?  That's what you are doing?  You're type of ignorant arrogance is what's wrong with the country.  A piece of legislation picks winners and losers among different corporations and different people and you somehow have become a crusader for one side. That's what's wrong with the country. Old people just using the internet for email subsidize cord cutters (like myself) and you think that's ok.  I personally think the benefits of net neutrality outweigh the costs but I despise people like you that don't realize there are legitimate reasons for both sides. 
$C: He kinda of has point tough.
$C: Good points, still not addressing the ability for the FCC to threaten ISP's with revoking a broadcast license to censor internet sites. 


$C: Except Cable Companies are a part of a Duopoly where there's no competition.

Aren't you noticing all the telcom companies merging with each other?

For many people, there's no competition. If you don't have Comcast, you don't have Cable.
$C: if you acknowledge that this is what is going to happen, why pretend this is going to be great for consumers.

Right now, I could enter the internet content industry with my own website for just hundreds of dollars a year. Cost of entry is incredibly low. Market is incredibly competitive. 

ISP's take over with their vertical trusts, now they block or throttle their competition. That isn't a free market. That's abuse of monopoly (created in part by poor state government decisions on rules governing telephone poles and land for telecommunications) to make the freeist market we have anti-competitive.
$C: Do you completely lack an understanding of how PAC's work? Pay-to-play politics? 

The government can't just -do things-. There is a system of checks and balances in place making sure that the elected representatives take into account the opinions of the people who got them elected. 

And voters don't get representatives elected. Corporations do.

Just as an example? Note the lobbying done by politicians during the iraq war on behalf of the oil companies. Hell, you should get an idea of just how DEEPLY tied together business and government is because we have the term 'military industrial complex'.
$C: Is your current ISP screwing you over? If no, were they screwing you over prior to 2015? If they were never screwing you over, wouldn't it stand to reason they aren't screwing you over out of fear of a competitor coming in and winning over all their customers?
$C: > the government holds no sway over their decisions.

Not true, because the Government is attempting to sway their decisions with Net Neutrality laws. You can't claim the Government has no impact on the FCC, if the Government is creating laws that impact the FCC.

> If you would want to have NN removed the monopoly of ISPs needs to go.

I agree. Monopolies are bad. Competition creates an incentive for companies to innovate, and allows customers to get the best service possible by allowing them to choose what best serves them. What I've been advocating for is a Free Market solution, and Monopolies fuck over a Free Market.

Lots republicans don't pretend. You only hear about republicans that do want net neutrality gone.

>All they have to do is... stop voting Republican. Or even better, vote Democrat

>What I'm saying is that they should take responsibility for the consequences of their actions. .

...by voting on another party that just don't represent most of their needs? That does not make any sense and you know it doesn't.

Hold the *politicians* responsible who pushed it forward.
$C: Lol. Yeah you right.
$C: 1. When you said, "its not a bipartisan issue," you implied that its a partisan issue. Which means that republicans don't want net neutrality (this is further strengthened by how you initially brought up that liberals did this and not Reddit). That was your blanket statement. Implying that Reddit is only trump supporters. Which in and of itself is an idiotic thing to say when you yourself said that it was Russian bots doing all the trump supporting. Do you think that everyone on this site is so stupid that they can't formulate their own opinions on things? And do the Russian bots speak for the entirety of Reddit? There's a severe lack of logic and a plethora of contradiction in your rebuttals here.

2. Which Reddit has been trying to help fix by spreading the word about net neutrality.  Which brings is back to your original statement about how Reddit didn't do anything and rather, left-leaning liberals did. And how that statement makes no sense given that you plainly stated that you know plenty of conservatives against trump and pro- net neutrality. I mean, Jesus dude. What are you even debating at this point?
$C: Even without the monopolies, the ISPs should not be allowed to do the things NN prevents.
$C: You should be aware that removing NN actually **makes it easier** for those big mega corporations to control that speech. They are the ones with the money to bribe the isps into throttling the competition.

If that's your actual goal, you should be cheering on NN. It helps you. You either have other motives it don't understand the effects of this.

I didn't accuse you of anything.

Those companies are paying their own internet providers for access. There are other isps that think they are entitled to get money from those companies as well (even though their users that are accessing those sites are paying them from the other end). It's a great cash great that doesn't align with how the internet functions.
$C: Here was my major source on someone who successfully started their own ISP: https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/one-big-reason-we-lack-internet-competition-starting-an-isp-is-really-hard/

There are charlatans everywhere, and while I'm not a *huge* fan of trusting the government I'm even less a fan of trusting major corps.  It's fully possible even probable there are ulterior motives behind the net neutrality, but I'm trying to go with the option *less* likely to screw me and people like me over. 

Also I totally agree, I feel like yelling at someone only makes them shut their ears harder. having a civil discussion about disagreements is how you foster understanding and find common ground.
$C: I think we agree at least with the fact that a totally free market isn’t ideal. I think most conservatives probably agree with that as well, at least in practice if not in principle. I think it is important though to remember the power of markets to drive innovation and creation. They are good things, even if they are used poorly or abused. 
I will say that regulation is also hard to get right. For example, I work in a highly regulated industry that I would agree needs a level of regulation. Some of our regulations now are fine. The problem is we have a lot of regulations that are well intentioned, but ultimately don’t change any of my actions, and wouldn’t even if I were acting with ill intent. They only take a tremendous amount of time to comply with and are unnecessarily redundant. Some tasks that should take 5 minutes now take 45 minutes. Meanwhile much of what the regulation is trying to prevent is still happening because the regulations were written and enforced poorly. I think that’s where a lot of frustration comes from: seeing regulation that wastes time and doesn’t achieve its objective of preventing something perceived as wrong. What’s also frustrating is generally when people (at least in my industry) try to speak out about it they’re accused of not wanting to do what is right or more specifically trying to get away with what the regulation is trying to prevent. So even when we try to help with making regulation actually effective and not unnecessarily burdensome without achieving its goal, we’re looked at as the bad guys. 
$C: The fact you're arguing search result ranking in a desperate attempt to change the subject is telling.

$C: I am blaming Republicans in the instance of the Postal Service, because they took a specific action \(increasing the pension obligation of the agency\) that led to the Postal Service being underwater.

As for Obamacare, health care is complicated and it's easy to come up with statistics that conform to your political biases, but \(a\) it did bend the cost curve for individual spending on health care down and \(b\) Democrats have proposed numerous improvements to the law that Republicans are unwilling to consider, lest they inadvertently contribute to improving health outcomes and therefore justifying the law. Republicans are now actively sabotaging the ACA so anything that happens with it now is on their hands.

As for Amtrak, what is your specific issue with it?

$C: Honest question: why do you think compromise is good, or even possible?

One side wants to raise taxes. The other does not. There is no compromise \- if you raise taxes a little, you are advancing the objective of one side but not the other. The no new tax side gets no benefit.

One side wants to build a wall. The other does not. Do you compromise by building a very tiny, easily scalable wall? Or half a wall?

One side thinks you have a right to be born. The other side thinks your mother has the right to abort you. Can you settle for being half\-aborted?

This notion that democrats and republicans should come together and pass some nonexistent legislation that makes everyone happy and makes America more prosperous is what's childish. 
$C: Um.. What? Isn't the issue here that the fcc moved isp companys to a lower less restricted class enabling them to have fast lanes for companies that sign contracts with them. If I'm wrong pls correct me. But I think my understanding is that most people don't want to let this happen because every potential way these new regulations could be abused buy isp companies like comcast that already place huge price hikes in areas where dish style home internet is the only competitor.
$C: Go jerk off to fox news
$C: I'll take your petty downvote.  I'll be upvoted shortly while your posts continue to sink because your "but muh both partys is duh same!" is demonstrably false and your arguing that bullshit in a comment thread that makes it clear as day that both parties absolutely aren't the same yet here you are none the less...  
$C: Can't win argument, guess it's time to insult the person arguing it. 

Republicans have absolutely abused this tactic this year. Was a very bad look when they attacked the children from the school shooting in Florida. People are realizing that this is the case now. We'll see how the election goes this year, mate. Personally, I think the party that attacks children, minorities, women, common decency, and the foundations of freedom will probably get massacred in the polls. People are actually really tired of the profoundly negative world view and governance Republicans gave us this administration.

The real question you should ask yourself is in 10 years time, will you act like this is the Iraq War and "the whole time you didn't really support it" or if you'll own this mistake and grow from it?
$C: I'm willing to admit that 10% of the blame lies with the Democrats and 90% of the blame lies with the GOP. That is about as factually accurate as you can get, since 51 of the 57 senators supporting Haspel are Republicans.

That being said, You're right that, as progressives (apologies if I'm wrong in assuming you're left leaning), we should continually push the Democrats to stand up for what's right. But, IMO, I think it's more important to make people realize that, at least over the past few years, the Democratic party has largely had their interests in mind, while the Republican party has been hell-bent on screwing over working class Americans at every opportunity they get.

I often see a lot of flak given to the moderate Democrats like Joe Manchin that occasionally vote regressively against the rest of the Democratic party. While I understand and generally agree with those criticisms, I rarely see the GOP get chewed out for their same votes. 

Not to mention, these are individuals breaking against party lines when they vote in such a way. I'd absolutely support these corporate Democrats being challenged in the primaries, but this net neutrality vote proves that in any case they're better than their Republican counterpart. Ultimately, the Democratic party is against Haspel's nomination, but they don't get to force all Democrats to vote in unison. 

Democrats seemed to be held to a higher standard, as your post corroborates. That might not seem that bad, but it's a problem come voting day if a person expects a Democrat to be significantly better than their Republican opponent in order to earn a vote.

If holding Democrats to a significantly higher standard than Republicans leads to more Democrats being voted out in November, then we've just exacerbated the problem instead of fixing it. I would imagine that's not something either of us wants.
$C: All of my literally this
$C: Good luck on your journey. There's always more to learn, and my own views are still evolving - not necessarily my values, but my understanding of how the world itself works.

I can tell you that this "my main internal conflict is freedom vs regulation, and I tend to lean more strongly towards freedom." is definitely one of those things that will hopefully change soon. It's a false dichotomy - in reality, regulations are one of the best tools we have for increasing and enabling freedom. Laws against murdering and assaulting others, for example, let us walk the streets without fear that we'll be killed by passerbys, and we all benefit from a multitude of opportunities as a result. This is clearly a regulation, yet for all practical purposes we are *more* free as a result of it's limitations.

Not all regulations are pro-freedom, of course, but it's not a war between freedom and regulation - it's a war between freedom and aristocracy, and regulation is a merely a weapon.
$C: Imagine instead that you start with the idea that you don't want to pay taxes, and then back into political beliefs based on which ones reinforce that. Libertarianism exists in every failed state in the world, and they're unlivable hellholes. You never see a group of Libertarians going to go free market themselves a compound in Africa that follows their ideals - they want the benefits and protections of living in a state with a functioning government but don't want to pay in.
$C: So because you don’t agree with a few arbitrary and mostly false/assumes policies you think it’s okay to hate them? Get a life, man. That’s not how we evolve and move forward. 
$C: The fact you had to explain it was supposed to be a rebuttal -a shitty one at that- speaks volumes. But I’m not going to stop you from saying idiotic things. You’re trying to be dismissive of damning facts. I get it. It’s just expected. An edgy middle school rebuttal at best. Or grown ass leftist. Same thing. Oh well. 
$C: So rather than actually explaining it to them, you laughed, stared at them, and walked off, leaving them no more informed and far more confused than before?

You respresented that attitude by bringing up gun ownership as one of your key benefits of living in a red state.

So that aside, I'll bite. The way I would envision explaining these issues objectively is something like this:

* Some policy makers argue the threat of regulation is needed to keep the telecoms in check. Without it, quasi-monopolists can raise prices, extort companies trying to reach their customers, and create anti-competitive internet bundles similar to cable TV. They could squeeze out startups, and hinder the efforts of cities to provide technology services to their residents. Further, repealing the Obama-era rules will only last until Democrats come back in office, making this into a political football. Better the leave the laws as-is.

* Some policy makers argue that the market needs to operate more freely so that companies can innovate. Further, being able to prioritize traffic will be used to enhance things like autonomous cars, life-saving medical devices, delivery drones, etc. Broadband providers will be more likely to invest in things like a 5G network and large scale infrastructure investments; something they have been shying away from since the Obama-era net neutrality changes. Better to repeal those laws.

That's just me spending a few minutes attempting to do this. These could be written better, include statistics and evidence, etc, given time and energy toward being intellectually honest about the topic.

Cheers.
$C: I feel like there’s so many signs now that they sort of blend in with the surroundings. I don’t even bother to read them.

And wow! The internet truly connects, incredible
$C: At this point of the younger trump supporters I know, most of them openly admit trump is a piece of shit but simply don't care. They just want the agenda furthered, and if that happens and immigration is made stricter they could care less about what trump does or says. To me, that's a dangerous outlook to have and it degrades the integrity of the office, but I've had little luck convincing them of that.
$C: The one guy that comes to mind works for a union, so yeah, he has literally no idea. 
$C: Funny how he calls others useful idiots but he’s just going to go facedown ass up to take it. Putting his foot in his mouth right there lmfao.
$C: Holy crap, you *just* told somebody off for being immature:

"I’m taking everything you say with a grain of salt because you lack maturity “sad ,pathetic , losers” you sound like trump and his rabid fan base. Stop projecting your insecurities onto other people and grow up."

People like who you are so unaware of how hypocritical they are is why Trump got elected. Please, for your and everybody's sake, go read through the rest of your comment history with a loving, peaceful, and *critical* eye.

You also appear to shut down and/or block anybody who disagrees with you. Does that not sound familiar? Because that's exactly what Trump does. That's not how you embrace diversity and learn to how love people who are different from you. 

I know you can love people who you identify with - BUT THE HARD PART IS LOVING THE PEOPLE YOU DISLIKE OR DON'T UNDERSTAND.

You're making yourself an echo chamber. And it is very loud and angry in there.

edit: Calling somebody as dick is mocking them: "Except you’re not, you’re just being a dick. If you want to add value to discussion don’t mock and insult people with dissenting opinions. It makes you look 12."
$C: I for one think reminding people of the reality of situation is the most valuable thing in this discussion 
$C: Thank you, that sort of makes sense. A little more active system (the governor have to do it), but filling the same role.
$C:  McCain is a Democrat anyway. 
$C: >city that large

LOL you have no idea how small blacksburg is. During the summer when students were gone it was abandoned. It's also in the middle of the mountains.

edit: also just noticed you said TMobile and AT&T, which aren't even ISPs.
$C: He changed his position so much that the republicans had to tell him he was off script. What part of that aren't you getting? You must do some real mental gymnastics to say that's not flopping.

Never mind you've missed the ENTIRE point. My joke was pointing out their joke. But I don't think you'll ever quite get that.
$C: I don't owe you my free time.  I have zero obligation to justify myself to you. 
$C: Ah. I forgot about that. Well keep in mind that the word is translated from chinese and doesnt have the same meaning. It is a democracy, in that a majority vote of officials is required for the president. But that's where the similarities end. For many years the word democracy was banned in social media. And about taiwan, you cant generalize their way to all of mainland china. For one thing, taiwan is much smaller. For another, it was the educated and well off who ran off to Taiwan, not the rural and uneducated farmers, who still make up most of mainland china and make it therefore unsuitable for a western democracy. You can't have a working democracy in a country where most people are  uneducated farmers 
$C: Point proven.
$C: Third Reich is long dead, you lost
$C: As a counter to number 5, I know for a fact that over here in England you can be refused an operation or transplant if there is a reasonable believe that you’ll maintain a lifestyle that will render it pointless.

A prime example is that a heavy smoker will be refused a lung transplant if it’s clear that they have made no attempt and have no intention of quitting smoking.

Having universal healthcare doesn’t remove the ability for doctors, surgeons and hospitals to refuse treatment to someone who is purposely abusing their body to the point where it costs the system more to keep them alive than to let them die.  Organ transplant and patient review boards would still exist and they would still be able to turn around and as “Why should we put your body on the road to recovery when you’re not going to make the effort to allow it to recover?”
$C: 1. Perhaps we need more oversight and transparency. Just because the money isn't being spent wisely now doesn't mean we can't fix it for the future. 

2. There's A LOT of people in the healthcare industry who are employed to simply code and bill and charge and collect. If we redirect some of that workforce to actual healthcare some of the over burdening you speak of would dissipate. 

3. Probably because we allow them to purchase the power to do whatever they please here, so they follow the path of least resistance and turn our population into guinea pigs that pay for the pleasure. 

4. Again.. more oversight and transparency is needed. We need to demand things happen how we want and need them to. 

5. There are going to be freeloaders.. its human nature.. at this point in time you're still being charged for the freeloaders. Part of the reason a 1$ bandaid is $20 is to cover the 19$ the hospital had to write off because of a person or an insurance company not covering the costs.
Also, preventive care, WILL eliminate more of these issues than you think.  

6. I'm saying that its very much an opinion to say that govt money shouldn't be spent on healthcare or war or public parks etc. However if people really sit down and think about it, healthcare and the betterment of the society you live in is a better choice. 
$C: Well your first point goes out the Window, and your second point does too. The average wage in Northern and Western Europe is WAY more than $15,000/year.  China is about $10,000/year and Europe is far wealthier per capita.
$C: ok 👌
$C: I certainly lean left on most things but I support the death penalty for rare cases 
$C: Oh my god you're an idiot

I'm sorry I don't like to do insults especially in debates but come the fuck on

"Both sides" Is a regular ass phrase not some trump thing

This is what I mean you're writing off a regular and useful phrase because someone you don't like used it

It's shortsighted and does more harm than good, also do I have to prove that I don't like trump or something?
$C: And the left defended a president who killed thousands of innocent people in drone strikes over 8 years. Literally murdering innocent people.  Both parties are full of shitty, immoral people. They are pretty much the same. And trying to connect his this guys use of the word same to defending Nazis is completely absurd. Hate to tell you but you are the same as the fanatical right wingers you hate. 
$C: I'm sorry, what exactly does it mean to "proudly defend and support the Constitution and Founding Fathers", and why would "repealing constitutional amendments" (any of them, apparently, not just specific ones) be the opposite of that? Please be specific enough that you don't end up arguing that Prohibition should have never ended.
$C: [deleted]
$C: And if I don't want to be a plumber, or an electrician? Again, the entire point of more education opportunities is more choice. Like I said earlier, your first post implied that you would have gone to college if you could have done it cheap.

Market forces will correct for understaffed fields; employers would eventually pay more to attract people to become plumbers, or electricians.

Edit: I have to wake up early tomorrow. Have a nice night
$C: No matter how moderate/extreme any one legislator is, they will vote for their party to control the Legislature. NN probably won't get through the house, because even if 22 Republicans could vote for it, Paul Ryan will never allow it to come to the floor.

Food for thought.
$C: Sure thing.
$C: >This is exactly how it works. You're lying.

Ok, I've only been working in this field since 2001 and currently do dev for infrastructure monitoring applications. But sure thing boss.
$C: > but if web requests are disproportionate, why is it unfair for the ISP for cease serving that endpoint?

Because literally anything that we, the consumers, like will cause a disproportionate amount of web requests.

>Why does government get to tell ISPs how they create products?

Because Comcast, that's why.
$C: The comment was drivel. If Netflix is using more bandwidth then a DC can handle, then that data center needs to upgrade their bandwidth to handle the traffic or Netflix will go somewhere else that can handle their business. There is no need to throttle anyone.

Bandwidth isn’t some finite resource. US ISPs have resisted upgrading their infrastructure where they could. Why would anyone over pay for 50mpbs for $60 a month when they could be paying $80 for fiber.

This whole argument against NN is rooted in ignorance and propaganda spread by ISPs. The internet has worked fine under the premise of NN. Why should we change it?
$C: Netflix isn't using Comcast's bandwidth, no.  Comcast users are using Comcast's bandwidth.  This shouldn't be a difficult concept, but apparently it is for some.  Netflix also pays for their bandwidth already.  Why should anyone be forced to pay twice?  If Comcast's users are paying a monthly rate for x bandwidth and y cap, why does it matter what they choose to use that bandwidth on to the ISP?

>Do you actually think your bandwidth from Comcast covers the entire route of the data transmission from Netflix's server until it gets to your house?

How is this relevant at all?  Are you suggesting Netflix should pay Comcast for the traffic outside their network?  And I'm the ignorant one?
$C: Republicans aren’t trying to get rid of the 2nd amendment and let illegals into the country and let illegals kill Americans because sanctuary cities which are illegal. 
$C: Thank you, i quickly looked to find a source for you so i didn’t look for whichever one is the most credible. However, i did find [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/62ep42/donations_to_senators_from_telecom_industry_oc/) 
$C: Also, theverge does have a slight left bias, but they are shown to highly factual by a [fact checker](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-verge/) 
$C: A market without regulations is anarchy.
$C: I’ll just let the downvotes do the talking
$C: Yes, what you said was false, that's why I called it smearing. That's the point. Well, it's been fun arguing, but there's really no point in keeping it going, you're going to misrepresent me, and feel that I misrepresent you. I'm sure we'll stumble across each other on t_d again at some point. Have a good one.

$C: Damn dude. What crawled up yours? 

Maybe NN getting repealed is a good thing so ISPs can censor your ass so no one has to hear you talk.
$C: *sigh*  Okay.  Sure.  Whatever.
$C: I never said there aren’t two sides to the argument. I just know if the telecom industry is lobbying for it, it isn’t in the best interest of the consumer. There might be a small subset of people it helps, but it will hurt more people than it helps.
$C: Every single ISP offers speed tiers. You aren’t paying for the same plan as your grandparents who somehow don’t use any internet.  My grandparents use Hulu, FaceTime, Facebook, and stream their TV since it’s cheaper than cable.  I know they aren’t alone in doing things like that.  So you want to kick up pricing for the masses for what reason? It doesn’t cost an ISP nearly that much money to push that line of bandwidth.
Want to run a test? Go set up a $1digital Ocean droplet or a $10 AWS account and see how much you can download and how fast you can do it.  For $5 a month you can get something like 1tb of data transfer at the fastest rates possible.  If AWS is selling it, then they are making money.

You really think Comcast, Time Warner, Charter, Verizon and Alcatel has your best interest in mind?
$C: >304. In the NPRM, we tentatively concluded that we should retain the definition of reasonable network management we previously adopted, which does not include preventing transfer of unlawful content or the unlawful transfer of content as a reasonable practice. We affirm this tentative conclusion 
and re-state that open Internet rules do not prohibit broadband providers from making reasonable efforts to address the transfer of unlawful content or unlawful transfers of content to ensure that open Internet 
rules are not used as a shield to enable unlawful activity or to deter prompt action against such activity.

Literally goes into the fact that they won't make ISPs responsible for unlawful content. If there is censoring, it's entirely up to the ISP
$C: People can make new companies for internet. There won’t always just be the same companies...
$C: Once again capitalism
$C: Here's a tip for identifying power structures:

Who is bribing who?

The person receiving the bribe is in the superior position of power.
$C: I'm pretty sure they're looking for ways to screw me over.  Because they are greedy and have no competition. 
$C: The FCC voted on 2015's Net Neutrality rules though. They put those restrictions on themselves. It wasn't Obama walking in and going "Hey guys I need this approved by Thursday."

The FCC created these rules to support past rulings they had made to legitimize a concept held up since birth of the mainstream Internet

Obama just happened to support it and was President at the time. 
$C: Good bot. Keep up the excellent work.
$C: > Lots republicans don't pretend. You only hear about republicans that do want net neutrality gone.

We’re talking about the ones that do.

> ...by voting on another party that just don't represent most of their needs? That does not make any sense and you know it doesn't.

> Hold the *politicians* responsible who pushed it forward.

But how? How can we hold politicians responsible? If only there was some kind of action we could take, something we could do that would remove those politicians from power!
$C: I've been "called out" for miss spellings while debating on here, and called stupid because I missed or switched letters.  And then, somehow my argument isn't valid.   
  
Or the famous one that every teenager jumps on, when you don't care enough to pay attention to put you're instead of your, or you miss the E and your phone doesn't give you the apostrophe.
$C: Why?
$C: >You should be aware that removing NN actually **makes it easier** for those big mega corporations to control that speech. 

I don't see any evidence of this, and okay, I don't care. I have faith in the free market anyway. We don't currently live in a free market. I am willing to meet liberals in the middle and compromise a solution that addresses issues that we *all* care about, but your immediate hostility to my bringing up actual IRL censorship as opposed to Democrat fear\-mongering about ISPs without basis in reality and dismissal with the thought\-terminating cliche of "hate speech" really speaks volumes about the real priorities of the people pushing for net neutrality laws, in my opinion.

You are not by any means the first person I have had this conversation with. I saw your comment to that other guy, where you made fun of him for thinking all regulations are bad, but here I am suggesting regulating the pro\-NN companies in turn and you are all like "OMG you can't do that they're ummm PRIVATE COMPANIES!!!!!!!"

Why can't I expect tech monopolies that are the beneficiaries of government intervention to be regulated themselves as though they were bound by the First Amendment? Why are you allowed to support net neutrality but I'm not allowed to go one\-step further? If you're going to get the government involved in regulating the internet, then it's a non\-negotiable condition of my support that it fixes the things that I actually care about.
$C: Jesus, can you hear yourself? Change the subject...? You just accused me of taking 3 hours to find an article on one comment,  then accused me of lying about the time it took on the next comment, and now you're acting like it's so sad that  ***I'M*** arguing about search times? Haha what the fuck is wrong with you, this is embarrassing, am I speaking to an actual child?
$C: Technology improved and voice/SMS got ridiculously cheap as bandwidth became available. At this point you're just paying for data. We're discussing different technologies here.

A more apt counter would be to ask if we'd have to start paying for data bundles. If it becomes the norm for wireline data, yes I don't think it's unreasonable to believe that if we see bundled wireless data packages as well.
$C: Small government. Small. Minute. Tiny.

The basic roles of the government are:

* Provide a criminal justice system, primarily to stop and punish people from hurting or stealing from each other.

* Provide a civil justice system.

* Have a military to defend the US from outside forces.

* Break up or regulate monopolies that misuse their position.

...That's about it. This doesn't include 95% of what the government does.
$C: Issue with Amtrak is that it has run a deficit as long as I’ve been alive, the tickets are still expensive, the service is poor, schedules are limited, and the trains are out of date. Everything about it is a top down fail.

But let’s put all that aside and for sake of argument pretend I agree with your assertion that the republicans are conveniently solely responsible for the failure of these massive government takeovers. If that were true and you are right, then you should be dead set against net neutrality. The republicans are in power right now. They are likely to retain power in the coming years. If the democrats manage to gain a majority, it would only last a few years until the republicans regain the majority. That’s just how things have worked historically. So if republicans always cause government programs/takeovers to fail, and republican majorities are inevitable, *why do you think net neutrality will work*?

Second question: Net Neutrality was only in effect for two years. We’ve just gone back to the rules we had from 1997-2015. Why didn’t the evil ISPs throttle websites and charge small companies to compete with large companies like the scaremongers say will happen? Also, during that 1997-2015 time period, in the absence of federal micro regulation, did the ISPs provide increasingly better service at a lower cost, or did they charge more for less service?
$C: It's pointless to debate with Trumpkins, who are completely devoid of scruples or intellectual honesty.
$C: The notion that literally everything has to be black and white is even more childish. He's obviously not talking about things that have yes or no answers
$C: No dude, the way these websites are painting it is a fucking joke.

From the inception of the internet (let’s say 1997 as a matter of practicality) all the way until 2015 when Obama’s gave the FCC orders to instate Net Neutrality, which is a HUGE regulatory power grab, limiting ISPs on what they can charge/service they provide, increasing costs of defending against regulation, increasing incentive for lobbying, etc. The FCC is a *bureaucracy* and when they issue rules or regulations, there is no voting. Obama basically said “okay seize control of the ISPs and put them on notice that the rules can change any time we want”.

What Ajit Pai (and Trump by extension of appointing him) did was to undo the new 2015 rules and make things the way they were from 1997-2015. Now, if you want to stream 4K, the ISP has the right to charge you for the extra bandwidth instead of arbitrarily redistributing the cost to me. If you are a hospital, you can make sure your record downloads are top priority, rather than having to compete with someone’s Xbox game for bandwidth. It’s a *free market*...sort of. There are still too many regulations preventing ISPs from laying cable and competing with each other locally, but this is an improvement.

Think about it for a second. How many of the ISP nightmare scenarios have come true? Did Comcast nuke any of your favorite websites? Have ISPs suppressed any websites of a certain political stripe *like Google already does*? It’s been twenty years and all the evil ISPs have done was increase the speed of your service a hundredfold *because free market competition works*.
$C: Strawman. Don't watch it. Not a conservative or Republican. Funny how y'all are getting mad at a strawman and are incapable of understanding the original point...
$C: Lol. I don't care about karma. And I never said that. That was never my argument. But keep acting like a pompous moron.....
$C: He literally insulted me multiple times and called Trump a traitor, which is a blatant lie. 

The party does NOT attack minorities, children, or women. Only extremists do.

You think *only* republicans were negative during the election? Haha yeah, that’s a joke. Both parties were fucking stupid. 
$C: >HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHA fuck off with your crocodile tears bitch


>Kindly fuck yourself, you reap what you sow


>Obama was BLACK and to most Republicans that's worse.


So, tell me who insulted who first? Or do those not count because they’re directed towards a conservative? Hm?
$C: Saying freedom vs regulation was a poor way to put it I admit and is a false dichotomy. Its evident some regulations create freedoms. It is more the conflict of what regulations grant more freedoms than are removed. This can be seen heavily in the gun debate through the argument of self preservation vs unnecessary restrictions. For me it's always been very difficult through certain issues but as I see more I'm sure I'll understand much more.
$C: These are the core principles of the ideology. Read about it. It's not arbitrary, it's not false and it's not assumptions.

Libertarians want to abolish your consumer rights, your workers rights, your rights to fair treatment from corporations, your rights to natural resources, your right to expect safe and sanitary products and services, your right to litigate, your right to healthcare, your right to welfare and pension, your right to public parks and spaces, your right to use public facilities and infrastructure.

If you had a brain in your head you'd hate them too, because they hate you, because to them your life is worth less than accumulating property and wealth.
$C: >You're trying to be dismissive of damming facts

>An edgy middle school rebuttal at best. Or grown ass leftist. Same thing.

I dont think this is the subreddit you meant to post in. Shoo
$C: I was not put on this Earth to explain how things work to people. There aren't enough hours in a day, months in a year, and I've probably already lived OVER half my life already lol. Ain't nobody got time for that. 
$C: As someone who engages these folks regularly, they resent facts and sources and are typically willfully ignorant. You engaging trying to change their mind is them winning by making you waste brain power that they handwave away
$C: If you knew how to read, you'd know he voted for Trump
$C: If only it could have been the real thing, with zero implications for her getting in trouble. Then we'd be one less step toward a Dictatorship, mixed with The Handmaids Tale running concurrently beside it. 

If you can't tell already, FUCK Trump, and YAY KATHY GRIFFIN!! She's ALREADY making a stellar comeback, all the while Trump is trying to avoid Prison for backhanded deals. 

I hope the IRS pops him with so many liens for tax evasion it will literally change the Trump name on every building they OWN, overnight. 
$C: Those were really cute!
$C: I, too once thought that way. But the track record of Republicans over the last 30 years speaks for itself. Com'on man, if you don't people to think you're evil, don't reliably side with evil for three decades.
$C: You can still see them
$C: so you're saying you can't refute anything i've said.
$C: I see you don't answer questions.
$C: That's generally a good policy, regardless of who you're dealing with. Though oftentimes it's not that cut and dry. 
$C: So nobody should say or do anything that might bother somebody? 
$C: When white people are oppressed you can justifiably get offended by the word mayonnaise. Until then it's just silly. That's my entire argument, I'm tired and not sure what you're trying to say.

Also, "years of oppression" includes this year too it's not just the past.
$C: Ok, I'll concede one for you 76 to go, I'll wait.
$C: I mean, I'm not trolling per se. But I do know there's nothing to gain from any of this, and it is entertaining me while my SO watches cooking shows. 

But beneath all of my replies, there is a not-so-subtle truth brewing, and when I start my gay frogs rant, you should prick your ears.
$C: Hey, MarshawnPynch, just a quick heads-up:  
**therefor** is actually spelled **therefore**. You can remember it by **ends with -fore**.

$C: Thanks, that's a well-written and honest approach. I really appreciate the perspective.
$C: Except you’re not, you’re just being a dick. If you want to add value to discussion don’t mock and insult people with dissenting opinions. It makes you look 12. 
$C: No, he just decided to vote his conscience on a few things instead of taking the party line since he's dying and all.
$C: They provide wireless internet. There's also satellite. 
$C: The republicans? You mean the people who never wanted him to be president in the first place? Traditional republicans are not Donald Trump. 
$C: And might I add. This is a very minor public opinion and policy we are discussing comparably. Trump has kept his word on mostly everything his campaign was about. Leave Paris. Leave TPP. TTIP. Iran Deal. END DACA. Renegotiate NAFTA. etc etc. the list goes on and on and this president is literally keeping more major promises that any president in our recent history.

$C: That's a "good quality"?
$C: It isn't a useful phrase, dipshit. It's an attempt to legitimize the awful, immoral shit people on the right do.

It is meant to create apathy in the voters by convincing them their voice doesn't matter.

You fucking moron.
$C: >Hate to tell you but you are the same as the fanatical right wingers you hate. 

The only difference I see is that my hatred and gnashing of the teeth is directed towards people who hold negative views on people who cannot change who they are.

That is the difference.

Where a fanatical right winger will hate a woman for the color of her skin, the country she was born in, the sexuality of another, even the gender identity, or hell, just the female sex in general I hate based on people with these horrible HORRIBLE views.

Is it still hatred? Yeah, it is.

Is it hatred for something they cannot change?

No. I despise them for the choices they make. Not who they are as a person.
$C: The vast majority of conservatives support the constitution, its amendments and the founding fathers wishes for the country. What is there to explain? Do you want me to entail everything the constitution and the founding father stand for? Liberty and freedom of speech, personal responsibility, the right to bear arms, a government that answers to the population and the population only, against affirmative action, for capitalism and the free market etc. 

Now for your second point. Repealing constitutional amendments, especially 1st and 2nd, goes against everything the founding fathers ever wanted for the country. Tell me again which side is proposing 1st and 2nd amendment repeals? It ain't conservatives that's for sure. Tell me again which side is pushing for more and more gun control or outright gun confiscation of law abiding citizens? Tell me again which side is protecting illegal aliens and lax border security? Tell me again which side opposed lower taxes? I could go on and on.
$C: And they do. They charge you for the amount of electricity used not what it's used for. A watt of electricity costs the same whether you use it to power a Samsung TV, an LG TV, or a toaster. A byte of data should be treated the same regardless of what that byte is.

ISPs also charge you differently if you consume a lot of data via charging for increased bandwidth.

Net neutrality is about preventing ISPs from charging you more - or less - for the same amount of data simply because it contains something or because it originated from somewhere.
$C: Its wonderful, we disagree. but that's the beautiful thing about where we live, we can do what we want and disagree all we want. We all get together and vote on what we think is best. I'm voting on not changing anything along with the majority of the citizens
$C: [deleted]
$C: So the DC has to charge all of its customers as though they are a Netflix huh?

Sucks to be the little guy.

And anyone who says "bandwidth isn't some finite resource" really isn't qualified to say that anyone elses opinion is drivel.
$C: >How is this relevant at all?

It's relevant because you said Netflix doesn't use data and the original comment was about Netflix and data centers.
$C: That was interesting to read and it had some information I did not know.For the most part I don't mind the verge I just don't like them as a political source I think they should stick to tech and stuff like that imo they are always a good read for new gadgets l.

$C: Did you just recently learn what a strawman is? You don't seem to understand it very well. **I** was making an absurd argument in favor of getting rid of electric neutrality to make the comparison with being against net neutrality.
$C: Which is why I agree with the vote.  That doesn't mean you and a bunch of other tools ITT aren't incredibly naive and act like walking advertisements, i.e. /r/HailCorporate material.  
$C: Devils in the details,

>we should retain the definition of reasonable network management

Insidious

>do not prohibit broadband providers from making reasonable efforts to address the transfer of unlawful content

Never trust legalese.

$C: Are you aware of how much time, money, infrastructure, planning, and resources would go into making a new IP? 

If it was so easy, don't you think everyone would have done so by now to compete with Comcast?
$C: No, they can't. Infrastructure is not like other markets. It is not logistically possible to be continually ripping up cities to allow new players to install their own services, it is too disruptive. The same goes for other infrastructure like power, water, etc. Neutral cooperation is mandatory for the market to function as a whole. And infrastructure monopolies cannot be broken by market forces, their very nature prevents it.
$C: it's called regulatory capture of state governments to maintain market control by preventing market entry, not "capitalism"
$C: There are no bribes.

It's called campaign funding, and it is 100% legal.

Politicians, for the most part, cannot be elected to major government positions without the aid of corporate interests. Have you noticed that a lot of Washington politicians tend to have a background working for the same corporations that they represent the interests of in the government...do you think thats just a coincidence? 

Do you think they suddenly forget all about their corporate history and their debts they put themselves under to get their foot in the door of big politics are instantly shed the moment they gain this 'power'? 

The iraq war was about oil. It was about money. Corporations used the power they have over politicians to send people off to die for the sake of securing money generating resources. 


$C: So no, you're not able to list any ways they're screwing you over? You're just supporting Net Neutrality on the hunch that MAYBE if your current ISP was possibly plotting to screw you over, surely they would do it in a way these new laws would stop? Assumptions don't make for good policy. Furthermore, greed would motivate a competing company to swoop in and save the day by treating their customers right, because treating them right would cause everyone to switch over. I remain unconvinced by your argument.
$C: But this current attempt to repeal Net Neutrality isn't being done by the FCC. It's being done by the Government; by politicians. So that means he Government DOES have the ability to sway the decisions of the FCC.
$C: LEAVE MY E'S ALONE /s
$C: Because that would not be the internet. I do not want the world's greatest invention dissected for the benefit of ISPs because a few people think any government regulation is bad.
$C: You have faith in a free market that does not exist in this industry. Stop living this delusion
$C: Keep it up, you guys are doing great with that attitude.  
$C: Cheap doesn't matter. If they could charge separately​ they would. But a competitive marketplace made an environment where no one could.
$C: OK, now that I'm familiar with your position, lemme share mine.

First, I need to define government, so I'll go with "the social apparatus a society uses to make collective decisions." Decisions like "How do we deal with crime?" or "How do we deal with outside threats?" or "How do we deal with monopolies?" like you've laid out.

I don't think there's anything inherently coercive about a group of people collectively making decisions that affect all of them. I think the abuse and oppression we're so accustomed to seeing and experiencing from our governments derive from one property of most governments: power. When one person has the unilateral authority to make decisions for 500 other people, and doesn't have to deal with the consequences of these decisions, bad things happen imo.

It's along these lines that I like to differentiate between the words "government" and "state": a government is a general umbrella term for any social mechanism society uses to make collective decisions, and a state is a strictly hierarchical government that ends up twisting and making collective decisions *for* a society, usually for the betterment of the minority ruling class.

I realize you're not an anarcho-capitalist, but I don't really think ancaps are imagining a stateless society; these collective decisions are still being made for a large group of people by a smaller group. A man makes housing decisions for all of his twenty tenants, the street owner makes decisions for everyone who lives and drives on their street, a public utility owner makes decisions for everyone that drinks water or heats their house with gas, a boss makes decisions for all of his hundreds or thousands of workers. The actual power of making your own decisions in your own life is still being hoarded by a minority from the majority, so I don't think attempts to limit the state by pushing it all on the private sector are really successful.

To be blunt, I am a libertarian socialist. I don't think people should have leaders enforced on them. I think a person should have the right to make their own decisions on what happens in their own house, and no one should have their house owned by another and be subject to their whims. I think people should have the right to collectively make decisions on what happens with their streets, in their workplaces, in their societies.

I just don't get how you're meaningfully changing anything if you're leaving the power dynamics that define our society completely intact.
$C: More or les yes that is what I'm trying to express. Things like President trump basically holding DACA hostage unless he gets money for his wall is simply embarasing for our country. I do think we need to fix our borders security but should we kill programs for those immigrants that are here and trying to become citizens in this country. At what point do I just lose faith in the system we have in place.
$C: Don’t strawman me. Instead, why not provide some examples in which “compromise” is not just moving to one side at a slower pace.
$C: >What Ajit Pai (and Trump by extension of appointing him) did was to undo the new 2015 rules and make things the way they were from 1997-2015.

this is flat out wrong. Net Neutrality has been enforced since the beginning effectively. what happened is in 2009ish courts said the FCC couldn't enforce the rules unless they reclassified the ISPs under title 2, which the FCC is empowered to do. So the FCC reclassified them and the ISPs threw a hissy fit and here we are.

>Now, if you want to stream 4K, the ISP has the right to charge you for the extra bandwidth instead of arbitrarily redistributing the cost to me.

wat? thats not how bandwidth works. you pay for bandwidth and you can use it however you want. if your plan isn't high enough to stream 4k videos then you can't stream them without buffering. nor are costs redistributed. in fact most networks are over provisioned which means you often do not get the bandwidth you paid for because it is physically impossible for the networks to provide the total bandwidth sold to end users.

jesus christ.

>Did Comcast nuke any of your favorite websites? 

yes, see the comcast/netflix fiasco.

>Have ISPs suppressed any websites of a certain political stripe like Google already does?

yes, for the same reason google does, because the government ordered it. see the UK. also google search isn't an ISP.
you're free to search the web using other webapps if google isn't meeting your needs. ISPs are your physical connection to the internet
you cannot route around them as you can with google. its apples and oranges.

>If you are a hospital, you can make sure your record downloads are top priority, rather than having to compete with someone’s Xbox game for bandwidth.

this has nothing to do with net neutrality, that is a private network performing their own optimizations for their own network.

>There are still too many regulations preventing ISPs from laying cable and competing with each other locally, but this is an improvement.

this is completely unrelated to net neutrality rules.

>It’s been twenty years and all the evil ISPs have done was increase the speed of your service a hundredfold because free market competition works.

no, they've been continuously brought to court by the FCC for violations, and have admitted in court they would throttle and do paid prioritization, and block competing services if the rules were not in place repeatedly.

they also had to receive government hand outs to lay the network cables that brought those speed increases and even then they did not meet what the contract specified.

your whole posts shows you do not understand the history or why net neutrality is important and you need to do more research before you start spouting your uninformed bullshit.

$C: Two comments? Struck a nerve, then. But, I digress, you were in the middle of validating my argument?
$C: “If you had a brain in your head you’d hate them too.” Wow so you’re just an all around hateful person huh? I don’t hate anyone. I don’t have a reason too. Much like with many republicans, democrats, Mormons, Christians, and every other group, a large subset of Libertarians don’t agree with or like everything the party does. Most of the ones I know are very reasonable people and have some compelling arguments for what they believe. Some of it is outlandish and seems like a pipe dream. Most only works in theory and some of it is downright deplorable. 

That’s still no reason to hate anyone. Especially over something that silly. 
$C: Oh snap! Didn’t realize I was in r/circlejerk. My bad!
Carry on. 
$C: Then that's your prerogative, but somehow you had enough time to stare at him incredulously and not at least say "No, socialism and Communism are not the same thing actually."?
$C: I think Pence is the handmaidens tale one. 
$C: I actually used to buy into the whole "the other party are just evil" mantra a while back, but I eventually came to realise that this is just a product of only being fed one-sided news and opinion. The same kind of behaviour also enables the right to see the left as evil baby murderers.
$C: Hiding comments behind an extra click substantially reduces their visibility. You know full well that most users won't see that.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I see you don't ask intellectually honest questions.
$C: Well I mean in a perfect world yeah. But I really can't stay in this thread with you any longer. All this straw is giving me some bad allergies.
$C: \>  When white people are oppressed you can justifiably get offended by the word mayonnaise. 

No, slurs aren't offensive just because someone is oppressed. Get your marxist conspiracy theories out of this.
$C: Nah you won't.  Cause, first of all, you couldn't even be bothered to look through your woefully weak bookmarked "evidence" in the first place.  And secondly, you somehow think your thirteen seconds of copy paste effort means you "won" something.  If you bothered to look through that gish garbage, realize that it's all hypocritical garbage that only disproves your theory, and have to hurry up and switch to some other logical fallacy to feel victorious.  And I'm jsut here randomly picking links and realizing that this is the best evidence of the Exact Fucking Opposite.  YOu literally have "CNN Contributor Falsely Asserts that WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange is a Pedophile"  and a photo that shows them literally taking responsibility for the statement and stating that it has no merit.  This is what *actual* news stations do when an error is made.  It wasn't a prepared news article, it was a comment made in error that was highlighted and corrected.  But nutjobs just LOOOOVE to latch onto shit like that- as long as it isn't from *Conservative News* of course.

But yeah, sure, you're right, it's just another fluke, I bet **ALL** the rest are legit, surely they are.
$C: There's never anything to gain from debating politics with people. Especially not on the internet. 
$C: Please, you can just call me Ndoilworker.
$C: You must be replying from inbox at this point, I have a 77 link list of just CNN. Everything on there is a year old+, so the real list is much longer. CNN is probably the worst of them, so idk if we will find middle ground.
$C: Bot code must've hit it's limits, cause it's clear I meant *your* angry tears, not mine.

Got anything else interesting to add or are you just going to keep laughing nervously and trying to disengage?
$C: this is “Bernie can still win” level stupid, I can’t help it 
$C: You are grasping for straws here. Satellite and cellular are not competitive with broadband at all.
$C: Nice dismount!
$C: That's just false. And the fact that you have to do mental gymnastics on only one example shows you aren't open to actual criticism or anyone pointing out that Trump flops like a fish. If you support Trump that's fine, everyone can pick whoever they want. The fact that you support him in the face of overwhelming evidence of how he acts, just shows how bad partisanship has become these days. You CAN support a person WITHOUT defending their every action. Learn to think for yourself. Someone criticism Trump isn't them criticising you. Separate yourself from the political entity.
$C: [I guess.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_average_wage)
$C: Yeah? I feel the death penalty can be warranted, I don't want every murderer to be subject to it but in some cases yes
$C: I'm sorry I don't look at things in plain black and white and I can see both sides have good and bad

I certainly lean democrat but that doesn't mean all republicans are bigot redneck assholes
$C: Yeah depending on the context, you're thinking of it only in the context trump used, which was a shitty thing to say but I used it in a totally different context

I'm not defending fucking neo nazis
$C: See, this is the exact opposite of what I asked you to do. Instead of getting more specific, you got more vague. What the fuck do taxes and immigration have to do with the Bill of Rights?
$C: >"Dedicated circuits" have nothing to do with bandwidth in and out of a datacenter. And no public datacenter has pipes dedicated to a single DNS endpoint. You are full of shit kid.

Are you actually this retarded?

Backbone networks need to obviously upgrade continuously but I fail to see how if one company like Level One or GTT (just basic examples) can't keep up then they dissolve and someone else does it correctly, the answer is not throttling business the answer is innovation and the free market dictating success of tiered providers.

This is ridiculous, I'm now dumber for having read your comments.


$C: Perfect example of a person meeting an expert in immediately distrusting the expert.
$C: > So the DC has to charge all of its customers as though they are a Netflix huh?

No. The DC (or the ISP serving the DC) charges Netflix for using more bandwidth. How do you not understand this?

> And anyone who says "bandwidth isn't some finite resource" really isn't qualified to say that anyone elses opinion is drivel.

Shows how little you know. I bet you think Comcast is just barely making a profit charging people $60 a month for 50mbps. Never mind the fact that as soon as google or another ISP shows up with a fiber package Comcast is all of a sudden able to sell a similar package at a competitive price.

I wonder what the mindset is of people who oppose common sense consumer protections like NN?
$C: Context matters.  Most people don't feel the need to regurgitate the entire context, just to add a supporting or opposing view.

The comment I replied to was about some hypothetical situation pulled out of the commenters ass that makes absolutely no sense when you break it down.

1.  No one benefits from actual network congestion.  Not the ISP, not TokenMadeUpPoorSmallBusiness.com site and certainly not Netflix.  That's why Netflix and Amazon don't pipe out all their content from one fucking data center.  They use CDNs.

2.  Netflix already pays for their bandwidth.  Since they use a fuckton more, they pay a lot more.

3.  Joe Blow Comcast customer and Netflix hardcore streamer pays for higher data caps and higher bandwidth on Comcast's network.

4. Because of content providers like Netflix, Comcast has more ISP customers paying for faster connections and more bandwidth.  

But that's not enough is it?  They now want to extort more money out of Netflix just to be greedy dicks.  And once they do that, which they already were starting to do before NN, they'll triple dip back on their customers and upsell them shitty "Streamer" packages where they kindly won't throttle your speed you paid for in the first place.
$C: The internet is tech. 
$C: In a free market, we would only have one wireless carrier.
$C: Free markets are unhealthy
$C: I mean it shows that people support what I am saying and don’t like what you are saying but sure
$C: If you're not refuting what I said, then why the fuck reply to me? Did it sound like I wanted to discuss electric neutrality... no. You're the one who brought it up.

But really, what has caused you to be so upset that you feel that you need to call people names? I find your usage of the term extremely ableist and disingenuous. Check yourself dude.
$C: Wow... seriously misread

>304. In the NPRM, we tentatively concluded that *we should retain the definition of reasonable network management* **we previously adopted, which does not include preventing transfer of unlawful content or the unlawful transfer of content as a reasonable practice.**

They're literally saying reasonable network management does not include preventing illegal traffic or content. You're purposefully twisting the statement. 

 > We affirm this tentative conclusion 
and **re-state that open Internet rules** *do not prohibit broadband providers from making reasonable efforts to address the transfer of unlawful content* **or unlawful transfers of content to ensure that open Internet 
rules are not used as a shield to enable unlawful activity or to deter prompt action against such activity.**

Here's the English, 

"We're using our old ruling that states providers do not need to prevent illegal traffic, nor are they prohibited in trying to prevent illegal traffic"

Or simply put, your house your rules. 
$C: But it is possible is it not?
$C: Okay lemme ask you a question. Did you notice a single fucking difference when net neutrality first went into effect not even 5 years ago? Cause I sure as hell know I didn’t. 
$C: Market entry is not at all being prevented
$C: >Corporations used the power they have over politicians to send people off to die for the sake of securing money generating resources. 

Was it corporations or government that sent them off?
$C: ... Ajit Pai, the current acting head Board member is attempting to repeal Net Neutrality. Not the government. 

He was appointed by Trump, but still has independence and in fact other Board members attempted to stop it with campaigning.

In fact the government actually had to stop the repeal because the outcry was loud enough.
$C: Yes, thanks in part to net neutrality. I have more faith in the free market because I don't think the companies censoring me should be entitled to equal treatment by ISPs, I actually want them to be throttled and extorted and charged more money if they're going to be assholes. Does that make sense?

If the free market is bad, then I've suggested a compromise that you refuse to consider.
$C: You are just too cute.
$C: Carriers still do offer them separately. They're just not the best deal. 
$C: > At what point do I just lose faith in the system we have in place.

What, you mean like completely ignoring federal law and rewarding felons for breaking it because they are a “potential” voting block?
$C: Thank God I thot I had missed something big here.
$C: My understanding of NN is fine. Do you want me to waste twenty minutes explaining point by point why you are wrong, just to have you stick your head in the sand?

It’s over anyway. Deal with it. 
$C: Please do tell how I was in the middle of validating your argument. 

Also, those two comments were 12 minutes apart. I didn’t want to edit the original because I didn’t think you’d see it. I disproved your point that I insulted him because I “had no argument” even though his entire comment was a big “fuck you fuck trump” temper tantrum.
$C: *I'm not talking about a party.*

I'm literally describing libertarian ideology to you. If your friends don't subscribe to this ideology they are not libertarians or they're claiming to be libertarians without actually knowing what libertarianism is.

Which to be honest is an extremely libertarian thing to do, because like I said, they're mostly idiots or deliberately selfish and malicious.
$C: Does Soros fund that subreddit?
$C: I could have, but again, trying to explain that....is a whole other ballgame. The interaction was brief at best, but long enough, I could have gotten out a "No, they aren't the same." But I'm also in Texas....so that's another factor.
$C: still not refuting what i said.  awkwardly insistent about it, too.
$C: Its a simple question, but I can see how it is over your head lol.
$C: Ya it is hay fever season. I recommend Flonase, works great for me.
$C: LMAO MARXIST CONSPIRACY THEORIES

I'm embarrassed for you that you wrote that comment.
$C: I'm not gonna read this because I understand your pain and where this is all coming from. I too can remember a time where I accused someone of having nothing and then they dumped a load on my head in public. It hurt, I wrote a big block of text just like this ^  one trying to regain some pride, but in the end I realized that my foray was futile, and I should've just took it on the nose with dignity.

I am releasing you friend, just imagine I'm Alex Jones, rambling about gay frogs in a green leotard, smile, and go about your day.
$C: Ain't that the truth. 
$C: Maybe you should learn how to express your thoughts a little more clearly then bud. But it definitely seems like you're the one crying with all the bitching you're doing lol. And I'll debate with your self righteous ass if you actually have anything useful or accurate to contribute 
$C: The lack of self awareness here that you're calling anyone stupid is hilarious. You're quite literally either the best troll or dumbest person I have seen in quite some time.
$C: Oh. I didn't realize you were moving the goalposts on me.

I watch good quality video on wireless even though my speeds are rather poor compared to most. 2Mbps is enough for DVD quality Netflix. 4Mbps is enough for two streams.

Is that not good enough for you? I want to know how far you'll move these goalposts so I can respond appropriately. 
$C: Thanks!
$C: Trust me brother I am separate. I wouldn’t have voted for John Kerry in 04 and then Obama consecutively if I wasn’t. Fuck I even voted for Corey Booker. 
$C: Donald Trump has saved my entire industry and is making my business environment much more friendly and prosperous. Here I am with a worthless college degree and plenty of opportunity. Thanks Trump. 
$C: So can you change your comment to where you called me wrong?




I'm glad you're learning something. There is no such thing as free healthcare 
$C: But a "good quality"?

And you know that there are moderate Democrats that are for the death penalty. It's not a Republican idea.
$C: I understand you. I apologize for calling you a dipshit and a fucking moron. Just getting back at the idiot comment you made to me. Pretty childish on my part.

I don't try to view the world as purely black and white, but there is a disproportionate amount of things I am consciously aware of that I can point to the right. I don't think the left is scot free, hell I despise a lot of what corporate dems have done and will do to the left in America but it feels to me that in the time of trump I am overwhelmingly more protective of everyone on the left, including democrats I used to not be very fond of, including Dianne Feinstein.

I don't despise or even hate every republican, but I will readily admit, I probably do view the majority of them in an extremely negative light.

*sigh*

Maybe if things went differently from 2015 onwards I'd be less likely to attack users even like yourself. I mean you admittedly describe yourself as leaning towards being a dem.

Still no excuse for the conduct I did give you.
$C: Never said you were.

I said the phrase is incorrect and dangerous to use as it gives whoever hears it the impression that the left wing stoops to the horrible levels the right does, which is patently untrue.
$C: Huh? I just gave you specifics on the first part of my comment. Are you blind? The 2nd part of my comment was just to drive home how wrong leftists and liberals are in their policies and ideologies.
$C: [deleted]
$C: >No. The DC (or the ISP serving the DC) charges Netflix for using more bandwidth. How do you not understand this?

I understand that perfectly well.  What I'm getting at there is at the next level.  Why are you OK with that and not a peering agreement between Netflix and Akmai, which is one of the things that sparked this current NN fight?

>Shows how little you know.

You don't even have to know a lot to realize that bandwidth is finite.  That you're even still trying to pretend it's not is really showing your ignorance.

So you think these ISPs regularly just waste money replacing lines and upgrading capacities when they could have just contacted you and you could show them how they could use their existing infrastructure to send unlimited data?  Wow.  You should get in touch with them because you hold secrets that are worth literally billions of dollars.


$C: So you'd rather them charge all customers regardless?  I don't get it.

Clearly there is a higher cost to ISPs if every customer is using Netflix vs just reading Reddit and checking email.  But you want to force the ISPs to charge both of those people the same amount regardless of how much it costs the ISP, AND prohibit the ISP from entering into a peering agreement with Netflix that could manage the inbound data and help reduce costs that way?

That just seems weird to me.

How do you feel about a la carte pricing for individual channels on Cable TV?  Or the fact that some channels cost the cable provider more to carry than other channels?  Shouldn't both of those things be illegal for the sake of neutrality and to prevent gouging?
$C: I never did say or doubt that it is tech what I was referring to is that since verge is a openly left biased news source I would be wary personally to get political news from them and I would always try to find a unbiased news source to get information from first.
$C: That’s inaccurate. Most carriers rent space on the same towers.
$C: The five percent rule is in affect.

90 percent of people don’t have the focus or attention to get what’s going on. 

Those in the five percent of them that know how to use mob rules can get anything done.

Doesn’t mean it’s progress nor good.
$C: You are against NN and I was comparing it EN hoping you would see how ridiculous it is. As a freedom loving conservative I hope you know why censorship is bad, even if there are ways around it. It sets a bad precedent.
$C: The word 'reasonable' is open for interpretation. 

Resonable use of force for instance.

$C: A very very very small chance that isn't worth taking because the IPs can sue/buy you out/hinder the process. 

These companies are not your friend, they are here to make money. They know we NEED Cable (which is why Internet should be a Utility) and do every dirty trick in the book to make sure they are the only option available. 

Killing Net Neutrality is one of these dirty tricks.
$C: It was always in effect. You're getting worked up over an unwritten rule that had to become written because ISPs want to see how far they can go squeezing ever last penny out of you. 
$C: Corporations.
$C: Your argument is essentially *"The Government isn't trying to repeal Net Neutrality, just a guy who WORKS for the Government."* It's a bad argument.
$C: 👍
$C: No that's not what I mean. my issue is that trump can simply veto this bill or the house can not pass it even if over 75% of citizens want to keep free internet.
$C: You did. This guy is basically just being contradictory even when there is no room to be (see bandwidth comment).
$C: great response bro, please prove me wrong.
$C: I mean, so we are clear, I was pointing out that he funded NN efforts. He also funds to shill many other places and efforts too. My point was to say that plenty of people fund efforts on both sides, but it doesn't make other people supporting the same side just as evil. 

example: company shills for anti-nn astroturfing. companies motives are shit. If I agree with the same stance, anti NN due to some other legitimate reason, it doesn't make me evil. Soros has shit motives. paid money to push NN. other people here who agree with NN agree with it for the good reasons. So saying "remember when companies shilled for anti NN" is like me saying "soros paid for NN" . Doesn't invalidate every individuals reasons or make them automatically good or bad. assuming so is fairly bigoted ... if we just assume everyones motives based off some shitty few. 

TL;DR, just because some shit bags wants the same thing, it doesn't mean the others are shit bags as well. people can want the same thing for different reasons (good and bad).
$C: [deleted]
$C: Simple, but intellectually dishonest. You were attempting a trap.

If I answered "good" then you'd argue that I'm not a libertarian because that view would seem not to jive with the specific interpretation of the Libertarian Party. If I answered "bad" then you'd get to call me/libertarianism racist.

It's intellectually dishonest because neither are true, and the subject is too nuanced to be adequately condensed to absolutes "good" and "bad".

So in lieu of falling for your trap by answering your question, I retorted with an equally intellectually dishonest question. 

If you answered that the patriot act is "good" you'd betray liberal ideals. If you answered "bad" you'd be forced to admit that government having total authority can be bad and therefore libertarians have a valid case against the civil rights act on that basis, thereby invalidating the logic that the objection is motivated by racism.

But I can see how that is over your head.

Your move.
$C: You're right, words are only offensive if they are directed at someone you personally think isn't oppressed, that's a fact! /s
$C: Oh look, deflection and attempted humour instead of logic and introspection.  Surely you're the finest of statesman.  Well, at least you do admit that your list is just a  load of shit you dumped out, perhaps in the hopes that someone out there might just validate your fragile convictions.  Sadly, I would be wary of anyone who would also look upon your garbage pile and optimistically think its anything other than the failed attempt at understanding politics.  They probably also have trouble understanding big words and complex sentences.  Oh look, I can play at being pretentious too! Except I don't have to do it to avoid the topic.  ... speaking of... here's another I love - that a Senior White House source told CNN that staffers gifted Sean Spicer some super soakers  -  http://imgur.com/EnELz0X.  An actual source from the white house told them this. They reported what they were told.  That's not "fake news".  I'm pretty sure you guys really don't know the difference between actual fake news items, and false or erroneous reporting.  Probably, you're too busy trying to sound clever and condescending to bother with things like learning.



P.S. don't lie, you've never realized the futility of your actions in your whole life lol.  Delusions don't count, either.



Also, you're all like , "go ahead I'll wait" but then you're not gonna read my replies?  Yeah guess I was right.  Ooh does that mean I "won"??  Is this what it feels like to be a Trump supporter?
$C: Laughing and disengaging it is then.
$C: Knowing the realistic fate of this bill is stupid?

One place where an ISP has a monopoly. I named one. Then you start talking about cellular/satellite(non-ISPs) and diverting. Who is moving goalposts here?

You, sir, are full of shit.
$C: calling 2Mbps good enough is laughable in most of the western world outside of America..  my friend in Sweden greets hundreds in mobile and thousands at home on fibre

And also...gaming... 2Mbps lol
$C: I can almost guarantee he didn't. Trump is well known to take credit for shit he had nothing to do with.

And just for the record, he does flip flop. Hell, look at the Stormy Daniels thing. How many different mutually exclusive answer's can you get from a guy?

Or look at marijuana. One day it's fine. Next it's not. Then medical only. Then, well hell, I'm not sure where he stands now. I can't keep up with the guy.

There's a difference between being persuaded by a logical and reasonable argument to change your view point on something. And then there's making off the cuff remarks with 5 different, and opposing, views. Trump does the latter.

But hey, if YOU wanna keep dragging this off topic from my original comment (and joke, lets not forget joke, that you still don't get) by mentioning all the things he has(n't) done. Go for it. You're just helping to prove my point. Your standing up for the guy based on emotion or some form of partisanship, I don't care who you voted for before. You're not standing up for him based on a logical and reasonable view. Get at me when you can stay on topic.
$C: The Wiki shows wages to be a lot higher than that.  Of course there is no such thing as free anything.
$C: Yeah and that's my point, it's not black and white 

Both sides have good things about them and both sides have bad, admittedly republicans certainly has more bad than good
$C: >  Just getting back at the idiot comment you made to me.

I mean that's more than fair I started the name calling which I shouldn't have (I just got defensive at the downvotes and the other comments)

You were totally fine and you are right that republicans have way more bad than good it just bugs me when people write off a whole side as evil

I think you're right though that all this political stuff would be different if things went differently, frankly I'm still shocked he actually won, like I wasn't a huge fan of hillary either but I thought she was a shoe in
$C: Yeah that's true I'm not gonna deny that the right's worst is pretty fucking horrible
$C: I don't think you understood the point I was making, then.

Let me try to formalize my problem with your argument, as I see it:

1. (Premise) For all constitutional amendments, conservatives oppose repealing that constitutional amendment.
2. (Premise) If someone opposes repealing a constitutional amendment, they support re-enacting it.
3. (Premise) Repealing a constitutional amendment requires the passage of a new constitutional amendment.
4. (Premise) Voiding a constitutional amendment's effect is the same as repealing it.
5. 1 and 2, therefore, for all constitutional amendments, if that amendment was repealed, conservatives would support re-enacting it.
6. 3 and 4, therefore, re-enacting a constitutional amendment that has been repealed is the same as repealing the constitutional amendment that repealed it.
7. 5 and 6, therefore, for all constitutional amendments, if that amendment was repealed, conservatives would support repealing the constitutional amendment that repealed it.
8. 1, therefore, for all constitutional amendments, if that amendment was repealed, conservatives would oppose repealing the constitutional amendment that repealed it.

This is a contradiction, so one of the original premises must be false. Premises 2 and 4 are common sense, while Premise 3 is an easily verified fact of constitutional law. Therefore, the problem must be Premise 1 - it is *not* the case that conservatives oppose repealing *any* constitutional amendment. QED.

So, please explain to me - what is the set of constitutional amendments that conservatives oppose repealing, and why would repealing this set of constitutional amendments in particular be the opposite of "proudly defending the constitution and the founding fathers"?
$C: No, you're wrong and obviously in over your head.
$C: >I understand that perfectly well.  

Well maybe you were just trying to make a simplified post but it didn’t look like you understood that.

>What I'm getting at there is at the next level.  Why are you OK with that and not a peering agreement between Netflix and Level3, which is one of the things that sparked this current NN fight?
 
Netflix used the fight for NN protection as its cover while it fought with Comcast for a better peering agreement. I don’t see how paying for private dedicated pipelines is a violation of NN. As long as Netflix remains a media company and content provider there is no conflict of interest. The issue comes when Netflix pays for a “toll free” pipeline directly to their customers. That’s anti competitive and basically let’s Comcast double dip.

Now if Netflix became their own ISP then there would be a problem. Much like the Comcast/NBC/Universal/Hulu mess.

> You don't even have to know a lot to realize that bandwidth is finite.  Thag you're even still trying to pretend it's not is really showing your ignorance.

It’s not finite. There is always room to add bandwidth capacity. Most users don’t use anywhere near there bandwidth capacity for their current over priced internet service. And that’s with our major ISPs artificially keeping the bandwidth capacity low. Sure you can argue that there is an upper limit due to the technologies available but since we are nowhere near needing that bandwidth at this point it’s not really an argument.

>So you think these ISPs regularly just waste money replacing lines and upgrading capacities when they could have just contacted you and you could show them how they could use their existing infrastructure to send unlimited data?

No, I know that these ISPs are enjoying the cash cow that is overpriced internet in the US and the lack of competitive due to their aggressive lobbying.

It’s just like how cell phone providers over charged people for years for text messaging. Text piggybacked off a normal part of cellphone operation where the phone must contact the cell tower. Yet these companies (most of which are now large ISPs in their own rights) overcharge by a thousand times what the text actually cost. I’m not saying they can’t turn a profit, but there should be a check on how much of a profit they can turn on a vital service. At least there was competition in the cell carrier market.

Again. Why would an ISP spend the money to upgrade to fiber service, where they could provide 1000mbps for $70 when they have the market cornered and can force people to pay almost as much for %5 of the speed.

Also why can these same ISPs all of a sudden offer competitive packages when someone else brings in fiber service?

No why use common sense when you can continue to buy into some bullshit spoon fed to you by an ISP propaganda outlet and conservative politicians who are bought and paid for by those same ISPs (Trump).
$C: >So you'd rather them charge the customers? I don't get it.

They're already charging the customers... How is this so difficult to understand?

>Clearly there is a higher cost to ISPs if every customer is using Netflix vs just reading Reddit and checking email. 

Why is this clear?  If streaming is so detrimental and costly, why have ISP profits increased while streaming has also increased?  Why are ISP profit margin's still so absurdly high?  It's in the 90s ffs.  This is bullshit.  Netflix is creating demand for ISPs.  They're both winning, but ISPs want more because that's what any good business with shareholders is supposed to do.

>But you want to force the ISPs to charge both of those people the same amount regardless of how much it costs the ISP, AND prohibit the ISP from entering into a peering agreement with Netflix that could manage the inbound data and help reduce costs that way?

Netflix pays their ISPs more money than Reddit, because they use more bandwidth.  Comcast, Cox, whoever, already charges their customers differently for bandwidth and usage.  If an ISP can lower their costs, why the hell would they pass that along to their consumers?  There's no competition on over half the market.  This is a stupid argument.


$C: I think you misunderstood me. I'm saying that in a free market, all the carriers would merge.
$C: Source 
$C: Where did I indicate that I was against NN? Lmao.

Let's say I am a "freedom loving conservative" why do you assume I automatically want NN repealed? You're homogenizing a group based off of a perceived thought that you've seen prevalent. Does that make it okay for me to classify all muslims as jihadists? No. That's essentially what you just said it was okay to do, by homogenizing an entire group. Once again, check yourself dude.
$C: C A P I T A L I S M
$C: A) no it was not always in effect look it up. B) I don’t think I’m getting worked up at all
$C: Lol yeah. Let's edit the Iraq war's Wikipedia page to put Monsanto as a belligerent.

You're delusional.
$C: Ajit Pai is appointed by the government but does not report to the government. He can act on whatever will he chooses and the government can't do shit about it unless there is good cause.

In fact the government stepped in and stopped his repeal due to the shady nature of how this Bill came to pass.

The FCC is not a puppet of the government unless the people appointed allow it to be (and due to the bipartisan requirement this is hard to get a majority). FCC Board members cannot be threatened with termination like members of the Cabinet without good cause and if they are whoever is doing it can face legal repercussions.

So yes, Ajit may just be a stooge for the government but apparently this stooge managed to convince a majority of the board somehow (*Cough* probably bribes/favors *cough*) He is the only appointment in the Trump era.

Which suprise suprise, FCC is a 3/2 split for Republicans and Democrats. Thanks to fanatical partisan issues this essentially guarenteed the vote.

$C: So you are losing faith in the system...for having separation of powers? Do you know what type of government we have? Please stay the hell away from any voting booths. 
$C: Hey your back. where you been? I missed telling you that you are wrong ... Show me some facts that prove your point pls. :)
$C: Anything specific, or can I just wait for the internet to not shut down this summer?
$C: I never denied he was funding anything, hes just such a huge bogeyman for rightwingers for years at this point it's a meme.

So alright, Soros funded this bill. He has shit motives. What shit motives he has, I got no idea, what I'm wondering is, how that makes the idea of NN bad.
$C: you've neither refuted what i've said, nor admitted your inability to do so, but made a pedestrian attempt at flipping the conversation to deflect.

after giving you a number of opportunities to engage legitimately, i've grown bored with you.  

bye.
$C: Hey if you don't want to answer the question just say no man.
$C: You think white people are oppressed too oh my god you really are that far gone.
$C: I wasn't joking. I literally read none of the first block and I'm damn sure not reading this one. You'll need 76 bullet points for my attention. Get to work.
$C: Yep guess you have nothing accurate or useful to debate about then. Typical dumbass republican
$C: Yes, the house will likely shut it down. Then come the elections when it's brought back up. This hot topic item isn't going away any time soon. As soon as people see what this actually does, it'll be back on the table. We're playing the long game here. You're being shortsighted and acting arrogant about it. That's what makes you stupid.
$C: > One place where an ISP has a monopoly. I named one. 

No you didn't. You said that wireless ISPs don't count, even though they are ISPs and plenty of people use those ISPs. 
$C: Faster exists. But yes, 2Mbps is literally enough to stream Netflix or browse the internet. 
$C: No man. You are defining someone’s stance over the course of their comments in real time. When you have a conversation with someone, don’t you actually  converse back and forth saying the opposite of what you believe questionarily in order to prove your point? Have you ever made a generality in your life? If you want to accuse Trump of being a Flip Flopper(which is a bogus and bullshit political taking point to be honest) then I recommend you actually listen to the man and find out what he’s about. 

When republicans were attacking obama for the same exact thing, I took the same stance. It is natural for a persons beliefs and opinions to change over time(ESPESCIALLY IN THE POSITION OF THE PRESIDENCY). In fact, you’d be a complete moron to say otherwise so I suggest you take your own advice on this one. 
$C: I am linking a source that is literally averaging the wages of the EU.

$C: Again, what good things do the republicans have about them?
$C: Heh me too man. Sometimes I truly wonder if this series of events was for the best.

I mean, obviously if Hillary won we would have had a lot more stability in our policy making and our global image but I feel like someone like trump was going to come to a boil at some point in the near future. 

(Not to say it'd be perfect w/ Clinton. There were definitely things back then I would chastise her for that in retrospect I've honestly dissipated from my mind.)

Maybe, trump winning allowed us to have a reality where a good portion of people are hyper aware of the shady influence going on in and around Washington with regards to the trump family.

If Mueller (a republican I deeply have come to respect) is able to uncover everything he is able to find unimpeded, and those persons are charged, maybe, just maybe this insane presidency would be living up to the promise of "draining the swamp."

This has actually been a rather refreshing conversation. Thank you for getting me a bit more grounded in not just having a black-and-white worldview.
$C: > So, please explain to me \- what is the set of constitutional amendments  that conservatives oppose repealing, and why would repealing this set of  constitutional amendments in particular be the opposite of "proudly  defending the constitution and the founding fathers"? 

I've said it before in the comment above and I'll say it again. The 1st and 2nd amendment which Democrats have tried to repeal in the past and continue to do so presently. 

I honestly have no idea why you felt the need to break down the argument in such a way. I wasn't trying to put forth a thesis on the mater. Unless you're deliberately trying to make the argument more complex than it really is. 
$C: >Netflix used the fight for NN protection as its cover while it fought with Comcast for a better peering agreement. I don’t see how paying for private dedicated pipelines is a violation of NN.

Well at least you acknowledge thar first part.  But NN does address the peering agreements as well.  Which means that cost is going to be passed on to the consumer, because there is no doubt that the ISPs aren't going to just lose that money.

>It’s not finite. **There is always room to add bandwidth capacity.**

That's not the same as not being infinite.  That's like saying my glass of water is infinite because I can always refill it.

>Why would an ISP spend the money to upgrade to fiber service, where they could provide 1000mbps for $70 when they have the market cornered and can force people to pay almost as much for %5 of the speed.

I don't know.  Why did speeds increase considerably in the decade before NN legislation was passed?
$C: >If streaming is so detrimental and costly, why have ISP profits increased while streaming has also increased?

Correlation isn't causation my dude.  It's clear because anyone with any knowledge of how networks work knows that an ISP pays more the more bandwidth their customers use.

Since you can't even acknowledge that basic fact and ignore large parts of my posts to zero in on the things you have talking points for, it's obvious that you aren't here to have a discussion, you're just here to repeat the same "NN good" "ISP bad" crap that is all over this circlejerk thread.  So get back at it somewhere else - I'm done.

$C: Well you didn’t clarify. And no, monopoly laws exist.
$C: If the Iraq war was not about the corporate interest in gaining control of oil...then what was it about?
$C: You're defining the Government as a collective, which allows you to dismiss any one single individual within the Government as not being defined as "The Government." It's just a semantics debate. It's wrong to say the Government has no say in how the internet is run. If a Government employee is making the rules, then it still counts as the Government making the rules. And I don't want the Government to have power over the internet. We're not getting anywhere with this discussion. There's a fundamental difference on what we believe the Government should be allowed to have power over. And the internet is so vital, it's not something I want them to fuck with. I don't care how pure their intentions are. As we've outlined earlier, this issue can be solved by fixing the monopoly problem. I think it should be solved from that angle, not by slapping legislation on every single problem that arises.
$C: >opinion piece from a lifelong republican, who has only worked on losers' campaigns.

oof, so desperate for anything confirming your bias you come running back a week later at the barest hint of it.
$C: Ok here is a senerio lets say there is a bill to ban Motercycles on higways. And 75% of citizens are against this but it passes through to the president and he signs it. Now all those people who were against this change have to wait to elect new congressmen to do anything about it. Yes we need separation of powers but I think there is something wrong if stuff like that is alowed to happen.

Edit: buy the way I would love to find a a way to talk more in depth over voice chat so we can have a easyer conversation.
$C: I did. Unless you are asking me to prove things that haven’t happened yet. “Secret plot of ISPs to kill freedom of speech - prove it wrong!” LOL.

Like I said you already lost anyway. To add *tremendous* insult to injury, the head of the FCC deliberately trolled you when he killed NN. You got trolled by a bureaucrat. How sad is that?
$C: point by point. get to it. no one said internet was going to shutdown. its just going to get far less consumer and business friendly for literally no reason.
$C: It doesn’t. For history I was responding to someone who said “companies paid so much to block it”. Which means just as much as me saying “so, soros paid to push it”. 

Everyone assuming that everyone against NN is a corporate shill would be like me saying everyone for it is a soros shill. I don’t think that btw. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: I don't answer multiple-choice questions on politics because I have my own opinion. How about you?
$C: When did I say that?
$C: Demanding simple and easy to digest answers makes you look foolish and juvenile.  For real.  When someone refutes my "evidence", I tend to read what they have to say, determine the validity, and refute their claims or modify my stance.  What you are doing is pouting because your quickly thought out view of the evil villain "Fake News" Media is actually a nicely put together album of propaganda.  

Like this one - [CNN Falsely Reports that Russia Retaliated to Sanctions by Closing American School](http://imgur.com/9Vs526S)  Absolutely, they misreported that the school was closed down, except in the sense that at the time it was closed down, possibly for a christmas break.  So they either rushed or Russia was very clever in shutting down a school at exactly the same time as winter holiday.   In the middle of an article about Russia sanctions and retaliations, Republican opinion, and political procedure, CNN reported that "a US official briefed on the matter" said that a school in Russia was being closed down.  

Most of the "Fake News" I'm seeing reported is allegedly from "U.S. Officials" and "White House" staff and sources.  It seems interesting that all of these Alternative Facts in these reports have origins in the Trumpet Administration, but since apparently you admit you can barely read a whole paragraph, I don't expect to see much reading comprehension from you.  I'm certain you won't read this, but that's okay, you've probably got important burgers to flip.  

Here's me padding the message just because I can.  I have a feeling you think that this is somehow a chore to me, or anyone else who both disagrees with you and can write more than twelve words in a response.  I'm gonna go ahead and place a wager on the "two finger typing" square for your abilities and skills, eh?  I would also wager that you have to sound out most of what you read too, right?  Nah I'm kidding I am certain your are simply misguided, not some simpleton.  But you can't be bothered to refute claims without using logical fallacies, so it's not like I'm missing out on any fresh and insightful point of view.  Your online persona is literally the "dime a dozen" archetype of Conservative follower, right down to the part where you will accuse others of actions your side takes with sneering pride.  It's comedic.  Have a good day!
$C: Full on damage control mode lol
$C: They aren't ISPs, they are telecom companies. There is such a thing as a wireless ISP, and it isn't what you are referring to at all (its what a NISP is based on).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Internet_service_provider
$C: Except he's not in a conversation, is he? He's defining his position so he can set policy for others to follow and lead the government. If he doesn't set a clear policy, he doesn't lead the government. And this has been shown multiple times. His own staff and him OFTEN contradict each other. That's because he FLIP FLOPS on positions so often that no one can keep up, not even his own press secretary(ies). Your blind to this. For whatever bias you carry.

I have listened to him. I know what he's about. He's an authoritarian who wields authority like a club. He is the loud guy in a bar who doesn't know what he's talking about. The embodiment of the Dunning-Kruger effect.

And I have said, multiple times now, that changing positions is fine. In fact I just said it in the post you replied to. I don't know what holds you back from understanding that, maybe a comprehension problem on your part. But I've said it multiple times. I have however explained that there's a difference between changing opinion over time, and a snap change in opinion because of some external force (because Obama did it for example) or because he doesn't have actual well defined positions (maybe because he can't formulate his own positions on things).

So I suggest you take MY advice on this one. Separate yourself from whatever bias you have TOWARDS Trump. And try looking at him with a rational and logical view. You'll be surprised I think.
$C: I'm finding your evidence uncompelling.
$C: No, I was just genuinely confused and trying to figure out what you were talking about. It's pretty difficult to have a conversation when you can't even agree on what the topic of the conversation is.

Anyway, it looks like you're trying to argue that conservatives want to defend and uphold the First and Second Amendments, while liberals want to violate or repeal them. Okay, good, that's a conversation we can have.

I am totally willing to give you the Second Amendment thing. It's a pretty unambiguous fact of American politics that liberals think gun control is a good idea and conservatives don't. On the other hand, that's just the *Second* Amendment. It comes second for a reason. There's another, more important one, and you're very, *very* much wrong about that one.

What are the main guarantees made by the First Amendment?

* Freedom of religion
* Freedom of speech
* Freedom of the press
* Freedom to peaceably assemble
* Freedom to petition the government to redress grievances

You say that conservatives want to defend and uphold these freedoms while liberals want to violate them? Bullshit.

Which party keeps trying to force religion into politics? Which party does [the state governor who said, "that's what we need to do - to amend the Constitution so it's in God's standard"](https://www.rawstory.com/news/2007/Huckabee_Amend_Constitution_to_meet_Gods_0115.html) belong to?

Which party did [the politician who was A-OK with spending taxpayers' money on religious schools until she found out that that included religions she didn't believe in](https://m.livingstonparishnews.com/news/article_6c2da5fe-c1e5-11e1-ae3b-0019bb2963f4.html) belong to? Which party, within the past two years, [tried to restrict certain people from immigrating to the United States based on their religious beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13769)?

It's pretty obvious which party is against freedom of religion, and it ain't the Dems.

How about freedom of speech? Now, I know that conservatives certainly *talk* a great deal about freedom of speech and how they're being censored. Indeed, for people who are supposedly being silenced, they never seem to shut the hell up. But while I will concede that there's a few fringe activists on a college campus somewhere whose view of freedom of speech is pretty sketchy, I'm a *lot* more worried by the actual politicians who [call freedom of speech "foolish"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcmiHx5Yf2I) or [call freedom of the press "disgusting"](http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-trump-follows-up-nbc-threat-it-is-1507746214-htmlstory.html).

And, of course, [the people who run over protesters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally#Vehicular_attack_and_homicide) and [the people who try to make it legal to run over protesters](https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/18/us/legislation-protects-drivers-injure-protesters/index.html). I'm sure there's something you could do that's more hostile to the First Amendment than *literally murdering people because you disagree with what they say*, but I'm genuinely at a loss as to what it could be.

So yeah, when it comes to the First Amendment - y'know, the *important* one - I defy you entirely. It's liberals who want to defend it and conservatives who want to destroy it, and I am not fooled by the Orwellian argument made by conservatives that disagreeing with them is censorship.

*You* hate America. *You* are destroying America and everything it stands for, piece by piece, so that you can rebuild it in your own tyrannical, totalitarian, barbarous image. *You* are the greatest enemy western civilization and the free world have ever had, and all the more despicable for your Orwellian attempt to present yourself as their defenders.
$C: > Well at least you acknowledge thar first part.

Hey I’m not the one denying reality here.

Peering agreements were perfectly legal under title 2.

> Which means that cost is going to be passed on to the consumer, because there is no doubt that the ISPs aren't going to just lose that money.

No because peering agreements are legal under NN. ISPs want to make it easier for the customers that are requesting that data. Peering agreements are a win/win. It only becomes a problem when a monopoly starts trying to bully one of the partners in the agreement.

> That's not the same as not being infinite.  That's like saying my glass of water is infinite because I can always refill it.

But it isn’t finite. ISPs would like the world to believe that they are just running out of bandwidth and that they need new revenue streams to pay for upgrades. The truth is they are making money hand over foot and even Comcast admitted to its shareholders that Title 2 regulations haven’t hurt their investment in infrastructure. The large ISPs are saying they are thirsty hoping you will give them water so that they don’t have to use their own tap.

> I don't know.  Why did speeds increase considerably in the decade before NN legislation was passed?

You mean when the ISPs were for the most part practicing NN and getting slapped down by the FCC when they tried to violate NN? Until the 2014 Verizon ruling so that the FCC had to reclassify ISPs under Title 2 to continue being able to enforce NN? How come those same ISPs were able to continue to expand and upgrade infrastructure and speeds after 2014? You act like Title 2 and NN hamstrung ISPs when there is literally no data to support that idea.
$C: >Correlation isn't causation my dude. It's clear because anyone with any knowledge of how networks work knows that an ISP pays more the more bandwidth their customers use.

You're just being intentionally obtuse.  You have no valid points.  I even wasted my time addressing your invalid points.  I've already addressed this multiple times.  This statement you keep repeating is objectively false and obviously so.  ISPs charge differently for bandwidth already.  No one is getting a free ride.  ISPs just want more.

>Since you can't even acknowledge that basic fact and ignore large parts of my posts to zero in on the things you have talking points for, it's obvious that you aren't here to have a discussion, you're just here to repeat the same "NN good" "ISP bad" crap that is all over this circlejerk thread.

> Democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths - theoretic politicians, who have patronized this species of government, have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights, they would at the same time be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, their opinions, and their passions.

Change “ban motorcycles” to “obamacare”. It took eight years to get someone in office who even wanted to undo it **and the electoral system was actually broken as evidenced by the FBI conspiracy against him during his candidacy** but we *still* managed to defeat the state candidate.

I'll grant you that there some Christian politicians trying to merge religion with politics. On the last point of yours you do realize that the immigration ban wasn't based on religious beliefs right? It was a ban on countries that housed or were responsible for radicalizing terrorists. A list that had been compiled by Obama and enforced by Trump. If it were a Muslim ban like so many of you say then why isn't Indonesia and others on the list? That's because it isn't a ban on religion but on terrorism which coincidentally happens to be in countries with a big Muslim population. Shocking I know.

>How about freedom of speech? Now, I know that conservatives certainly *talk*  a great deal about freedom of speech and how they're being censored.  Indeed, for people who are supposedly being silenced, they never seem to  shut the hell up. But while I will concede that there's a few fringe  activists on a college campus somewhere whose view of freedom of speech  is pretty sketchy, I'm a *lot* more worried by the actual politicians who [call freedom of speech "foolish"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcmiHx5Yf2I) or [call freedom of the press "disgusting"](http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-trump-follows-up-nbc-threat-it-is-1507746214-htmlstory.html).

That first Trump clip was quite a stretch and taken out of context as well. He was talking about shutting down the internet for terrorists and areas where they might live in because they were recruiting and spreading propaganda like crazy. That's a big far cry from actually, you know, shitting on the 1st amendment.

The article on "freedom of the press" is again another stretch and taken out of context. He was criticizing how little accountability the news media has and how they can write anything they want, no matter how factually false and still print it or showcase it. That's all it was. There have countless actual fake news being thrown at Trump these past 2 years. You'd have to be blind not to see the blatant bias and the number of anonymous "sources" stories they pushed these past couple years that turned out to be fake.

Now to address your first point about conservatives being censored. Facebook, Twitter and Youtube for example have been found guilty of actually silencing and outright censor conservative celebrities, political pundits and normal people these past years. [Link](http://www.wnd.com/2015/04/twitter-accused-of-censoring-conservatives/) [Link](http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/media/303295-how-facebook-twitter-are-systematically-silencing-conservative) [Link](https://gizmodo.com/former-facebook-workers-we-routinely-suppressed-conser-1775461006) [Link](https://stream.org/google-youtube-facebook-and-twitter-ramping-up-censorship-of-conservatives-is-it-soros-driven/) and my favorite one [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64gTjdUrDFQ). I could go on and on. Now are you okay with the 3 social media titans silencing/censoring conservatives? It's been known for a long time now that silicon valley preaches free speech but practices quite the opposite.

Also Democrats are known for their love for "hate speech" laws and such. [Link](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2015/05/20/hate-speech)

I'm sure there's something you could do that's more hostile to the First Amendment than *literally murdering people because you disagree with what they say*, but I'm genuinely at a loss as to what it could be.

That was ONE incident not to mention the legislation some people were proposing was in response to antifa and BLM protests blocking out entire roads and highways.

Theres a reason the big companies like Netflix are all about these 'protections'.  And it's not that they care about the consumer.

Newfound wealth and opportunity around me? Why would that be? I'm not American, I don't live there. And any newfound wealth and oppourtunity there comes from Obama's policies. Which were well on their way to driving the economy up, don't forget that what you see now is from him, not Trump.

How is it taken out of context? Do you seriously think it matters that the people he's trying to censor are enemies? Freedom of speech implies to *everyone*, even you, so of course it must apply to ISIS as well.

Let's not pretend that Trump uses the word "false" the way an ordinary human being would. For example, Trump believes it's false that he had a smaller crowd at his inauguration than Obama did, whereas an ordinary human being would agreed that that statement is true, since, y'know, it's what actually happened. Trump defines "false" not as "in conflict with objective reality" but "in conflict with what Donald Trump thinks".

"Hate speech" is a fairly broad term, and depending on the context it can include both actual protected speech and harassment. The question being asked in that poll is likewise ambiguous. What is "a public comment intended to stir up hatred against a group based on such things as their race, gender, religion, ethnic origin, or sexual orientation", exactly? Does it include scientific discussion of possible neurological differences between sexes? If so, then of course that shouldn't be illegal. Is it limited to people [distributing fliers encouraging organized attacks on a religious minority](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/punish-muslim-day-letters-points-islamophobic-hate-crime-counter-terrorism-police-bradford-a8249571.html)? If so, then of course that *should* be illegal. The concept is too broad to draw any meaningful conclusions from it.

You want to talk numbers? Then let's see some numbers. We can't just list individual incidents, that's not an argument about who's more violent, it's an argument about which of us has a better memory. Let's look at statistics instead. Tell me, who has killed more people in the past few years, Antifa or the alt-right? And who's responsible for more domestic terrorist attacks, the left or the right? I'll even let you cheat by not counting ISIS as right-wing.

> Also, I love this article. I really really do. Link

That article claims that there are times when violence is acceptable in pursuit of a political goal. And as an American, I am bound by the principles for which America stands to agree. In order to disagree with that article, I would have to condemn the entire Continental Army for using violence to pursue liberty instead of engaging Great Britain in peaceful dialogue.

Now, as it happens, I believe that people who use violence against the Trump regime are misguided. Things have not gotten so bad yet that violence is a legitimate option, and besides, they're *incredibly* bad at it. But I do understand where they're coming from. Like me, they see you for what you really are - the antithesis of everything America stands for, the great enemy of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And like me, they acknowledge that you *must* be stopped. I believe that you can be stopped peacefully. They do not. But I concede that if violence were the only way to save America from the nightmarish dystopia of alt-right-ism, it would be morally acceptable.

Oh, and again, these so-called "violent" leftists? Do you have any actual evidence that they're anywhere near as violent as the alt-right?

$C: > I didn't say that.  I'm just saying there is also no "data" to support NN helping consumers.  This whole thing is a protection from hypothetical bad things that failed to happen before the protections existed.

Uhhh you pointed out how ISPs have already been able to increase customer speeds even under the practice of NN. If ISPs weren’t trying to abuse NN they wouldn’t be fighting so hard to repeal it. He’ll the Verizon ruling wouldn’t have happened if ISPs hadn’t pushed back from the FCC enforcing NN.

So there are no downsides of NN. Why are you so opposed to it.

> Theres a reason the big companies like Netflix are all about these 'protections'.  And it's not that they care about the consumer.

Or maybe they don’t want companies to needlessly restrict access to their customers for the sake of greater profits for the ISPs. Not to mention that some ISPs like Comcast are pushing competing products like Hulu.

So in this case, what’s best for the consumer aligns with Netflix.
$C: It's not unrelated at all. Citizens vote and make demands every day but ultimately the government is the highest power in the country.

The Iraq war was about a lot of things. It made a lot of private organizations a lot of money and those private organizations are entitled to make those requests. Ultimately it's the government that acts on them or tells them no, just like it's my responsibility to decide if I should go 200MPH on the freeway or not and not pretend that my kid was in control of the car.

Trumps FDA scrapped that regulation immediately and now my business is thriving. That along with the pass through income discount means I will pay significantly less taxes than I did last year. You know what I am going to do with the extra money? Hire another employee and EXPAND my business. The economy was stagnant under obama. It is thriving under Trump. At some point (it’s been nearly 2 years now), you’re going to have to start giving the credit to Trump. If you’re not American than I seriously doubt you can understand what is happening here.

>You don't think that these people might have an ulterior  motive? That maybe some of them might like the idea of being effectively  immune to Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube's site\-wide rules,

You could say that for quite literally anyone. Even you. And to be honest that second part of the sentence is a perfect description of liberals in social media.

> the way [r/The\_Donald](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald)  is effectively immune to Reddit's?

Really now? Reddit's admins created algorithms to stifle and censor T\_D posts on r/all. T\_D is essentially banned from the frontpage of Reddit. No other subreddit faces restrictions as T\_D does.

>Provide me with either a legal finding or a statement from the  people running the companies in question. 

How naive. You really think they would publicly and blatantly admit to censorship?!

> "Hate speech" is a fairly broad term, and depending on the context it  can include both actual protected speech and harassment. The question  being asked in that poll is likewise ambiguous. What is "a public  comment intended to stir up hatred against a group based on such things  as their race, gender, religion, ethnic origin, or sexual orientation",  exactly? Does it include scientific discussion of possible neurological  differences between sexes? If so, then of course that shouldn't be  illegal. Is it limited to people [distributing fliers encouraging organized attacks on a religious minority](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/punish-muslim-day-letters-points-islamophobic-hate-crime-counter-terrorism-police-bradford-a8249571.html)? If so, then of course that *should* be illegal. The concept is too broad to draw any meaningful conclusions from it. 

Then you're against free speech apparently. If ISIS has the right to free speech then why can't far\-leftists and far\-right racists and domestic terrorists have it too? Your words not mine.

> You want to talk numbers? Then let's see some numbers. We can't just  list individual incidents, that's not an argument about who's more  violent, it's an argument about which of us has a better memory. Let's  look at statistics instead. Tell me, who has killed more people in the  past few years, Antifa or the alt\-right? And who's responsible for more  domestic terrorist attacks, the left or the right? I'll even let you  cheat by not counting ISIS as right\-wing. 

So you choose to ignore the numerous incidents I linked you and proceeded to move the goalpost to "which side has killed more people in the past few years". Very dishonest but I'll play. You seem to be under the confusion alt\-right=far right. It doesn't. Antifa haven't yet killed people by miracle. Their violence is off the charts. Everywhere they go there's violence because of them. The only actual "alt\-right" killer was that guy that run over some people and killed a girl in Virginia. The rest are far right loonies.[ Just a few years ago some Bernie Sanders supporter shot several republicans.](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/06/14/virginia-gop-baseball-practice-shooting-multiple-people-shot.html) But your attempt at attributing mass shooters political sides is entertaining. I wasn't trying to pull out a scoreboard but only show you that there's much violence coming from the left as well. Something you seem to be okay with it seems. Not to mention domestic terrorist attacks are very rare unlike protests and riot violence.

>I'll even let you  cheat by not counting ISIS as right\-wing. 

Lolwut. Since when is ISIS "right\-wing" by America's standards?

> That article claims that there are times when violence is acceptable in  pursuit of a political goal. And as an American, I am bound by the  principles for which America stands to agree. In order to disagree with  that article, I would have to condemn the entire Continental Army for  using violence to pursue liberty instead of engaging Great Britain in  peaceful dialogue. 

Again ignoring context. That article is a very clear call for violence for leftists and liberals alike. Only a blind person can't see it. Also that analogy is quite poor.

> Now, as it happens, I believe that people who use violence against the  Trump regime are misguided.

"Trump regime"? What the hell?! 

> Things have not gotten so bad yet that  violence is a legitimate option, and besides, they're *incredibly*  bad at it. But I do understand where they're coming from. Like me, they  see you for what you really are \- the antithesis of everything America  stands for, the great enemy of life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness. 

Huh? Since when is supporting Trump the "antithesis of everything American stands for"? That's some mighty delusion there mate. "the great enemy of life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness." My sides. Since when is Trump and his supporters against those? You're being so hysterically dramatic that it's actually pathetic.

>And like me, they acknowledge that you *must*  be stopped. I believe that you can be stopped peacefully. They do not.  But I concede that if violence were the only way to save America from  the nightmarish dystopia of alt\-right\-ism, it would be morally  acceptable. 

Wow. Endorsing political violence are we now? I'm starting to get the picture. You're an Antifa sympathizer or an actual member. Your over\-dramatization and hysterical remarks about Trump and his supporters only cement that belief even more. 

Also, since when is America turning into a "nightmarish dystopia of alt\-right\-ism?! That's incredibly delusional. Is everything Trump does or doesn't "ALT RIIIIGHT!!!" for you? 

> Oh, and again, these so\-called "violent" leftists? Do you have any  actual evidence that they're anywhere near as violent as the alt\-right? 

I just gave you numerous examples. Is kidnapping and torturing a disabled kid not violent enough? Is nearly killing an old man for voting for Trump not violent enough? Is hitting someone dead center in the head with a bike lock not violent enough? Fuck you, you pathetic Antifa sympathizer.

> Well, no, I also defied you on freedom of speech and freedom to peaceably assemble. 

And you failed.

> I *do* know the irony, or at least what  you imagine the irony to be. I know you to the depths of your soul.  You're the one who doesn't understand me, not the other way around. 

Again with the over\-dramatization and hysterics. You couldn't see the irony of your words and actions even if they poked you in your eyes. 

I'm done arguing with you. Intellectual dishonesty and sympathy for ISIS and Antifa are something that don't fall quite well with me. Then again I kinda understand now why you believe ISIS deserves free speech and why you protect Antifa and their actions. You're another deranged leftist with delusions of grandeur, living in a fantasy reality. Wishing violence on your political opponents, dehumanizing them, endorsing censorship on them etc. All textbook tactics of far leftists authoritarians. Even Nazis for that matter. I'd go out on a limb and say that you might even be a Communist sympathizer. 

You don't have a movement. History will remember you and your folks as the baddies, that I 100&#37; assure you.
$C: But the government did not tell them no. Your metaphor isn't appropriate at ALL because your child has no power over you.

$C: Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. So thanks.
$C: How are they oppressed? If they really are I'm sure you can point evidence to it happening.
$C: It's cute how you have resorted to the equivalent of a tween sticking their fingers in their ears. "Ha ha look at me being edgy".   Ima bet you think that you pretending to be flippant and dismissive of others really gets them riled up eh?  Like, maybe I'm just sitting here *seething* at the thought of you not reading my obviously oh so superior replies, right?  Nah, its sad that you cant be bothered to debate someone who challenges your argument, and I'm just pointing that out to anyone who comes across this thread.  You want to post up some propaganda masquerading as evidence of "fake news" alerts, go right ahead, but there's always gonna be people who will call you out on your shit, and eventually you'll figure out how to accurately argue a point, or you'll stop posting garbage clickbait links.

I thought maybe I'd need to post more text to overwhelm you, but looking back I probably have more than enough block-of-text by double.
$C: OH yes. That crazy stagnant economy under Obama. He only added 12 MILLION jobs AFTER the recession. Yes. 12 million ON TOP of replacing all the jobs lossed. Damn that stagnation. Corporate profits up 57%. Damn stagnation. S&P up 166%. There's that damn stagnation again.

All of this when he spent his first term fighting that worst recession in how long?

It was thriving under Obama, and he handed that to Trump. Trump inherited an excellent economy. With record low unemployment. And rising company profits. But don't worry. Trump is going to take that credit, and fools like you will believe him.

OH P.S Trump is set to spend more before his first term is done, than Obama did in his entire presidency. 

But hey. Don't let a little thing like facts get in the way of your bias!
$C: Of course I know nothing is free, everyone knows nothing is free.
$C: > What?! It WAS Obama's list of countries. Link If it were an actual ban on Muslims then Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh etc. would be on the list. 

You know perfectly well that the "list of countries" has nothing to do with it.

> HOLY. SHIT. Did you seriously just say that ISIS, FUCKING ISIS, were entitled to freedom of speech? Are you fucking retarded?!

Yes, I seriously just said that. Here are some other people who are entitled to freedom of speech:

* Nazis.
* Communists.
* Serial killers.
* Satanists.
* That guy who spoiled The Force Awakens for me.

The right to freedom of speech is not exempted simply because you're evil. This is Free Speech 101 here.

> Now you're being intellectually dishonest. Good job. Now you've resorted to projecting onto Trump and make up your own reality. Careful, you're starting to show your true colors.

I gave specific examples and data to back up my point. You respond with mere shaming.

> Something tells me you don't know just how much power and influence those silicon valley social media titans really have. Your "found guilty" rebuttal is quite pathetic. It's more than obvious they get away with it because they keep updating their ToS and are private companies. 

So in other words, you have no actual evidence, just accusations made by people who are blatantly biased.

> You could say that for quite literally anyone. Even you. And to be honest that second part of the sentence is a perfect description of liberals in social media.

Of course I could say that for quite literally anyone, even me. I *do* say it for quite literally everyone, even me. That's why I looked for legal and self-incriminating sources in the first place! If I had just linked to some liberal saying that Trump thought freedom of speech was foolish, that wouldn't have been evidence that Trump thought freedom of speech was foolish. But Trump *himself* saying it gets around that problem.

> Really now? Reddit's admins created algorithms to stifle and censor T_D posts on r/all. T_D is essentially banned from the frontpage of Reddit. No other subreddit faces restrictions as T_D does.

TD breaks site-wide rules on a regular basis. No other subreddit does the things TD does without getting banned.

> How naive. You really think they would publicly and blatantly admit to censorship?!

Trump admitted that he thought freedom of speech was foolish. Fair is fair. Your evidence should be at least as good as mine.

> Then you're against free speech apparently. If ISIS has the right to free speech then why can't far-leftists and far-right racists and domestic terrorists have it too? Your words not mine.

I specifically said that if ISIS was using the internet to coordinate military strategies, then it would be fine to take away their internet access. There is a difference between *saying* something and *doing* something, even when you do something using words. Saying that Islam demands the death of all infidels or that white people are inherently better than black people is speech. Giving out orders to bomb a specific building or kill a specific Jew is an action. The distinction isn't perfectly well-defined, unfortunately, but it's nevertheless very important.

> So you choose to ignore the numerous incidents I linked you and proceeded to move the goalpost to "which side has killed more people in the past few years". Very dishonest but I'll play. You seem to be under the confusion alt-right=far right. It doesn't. Antifa haven't yet killed people by miracle. Their violence is off the charts. Everywhere they go there's violence because of them.

Not to mention domestic terrorist attacks are very rare unlike protests and riot violence.

Where are your numbers? This is nothing but your feelings, mixed in with anecdotes. If you want to prove to me that antifa is just as dangerous as the alt-right (a term I will continue to include whichever far-righters I damn well please under, thank you very much) then you're going to have to provide some actual data to back it up. How many domestic terrorist attacks have the two groups committed lately?

Labeling riots as violence is cheating. Violence is the use of force against a person or other living thing. Saying that smashing a window is violence is as stupid as saying that slander and defamation are violence. They may both be *bad*, but neither involves any risk of physical injury.

> Lolwut. Since when is ISIS "right-wing" by America's standards?

ISIS is homophobic, transphobic, deeply religious, and nationalistic. I'm also pretty sure they support lots and lots of military spending and are extremely fond of guns. I admit, I don't know much about ISIS's domestic economic policies (assuming they even have any) but apart from possibly that, they seem like a pretty spot on match for the American right to me, just maybe more extreme.


> Again ignoring context. That article is a very clear call for violence for leftists and liberals alike. Only a blind person can't see it. Also that analogy is quite poor.

I move in leftist and liberal circles. You don't. I think I know a bit more about the context of that article than you do. I assure you, that article isn't even close to being a call for violence. It's part of a complicated internal dispute on our side that you wouldn't understand, and has more to do with self-policing than actually wanting to kill Trump.

> Huh? Since when is supporting Trump the "antithesis of everything American stands for"? That's some mighty delusion there mate. "the great enemy of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." My sides. Since when is Trump and his supporters against those? You're being so hysterically dramatic that it's actually pathetic.

Oh, come on. It's not as if you disagree with me that this situation is dramatic. We both agree that western civilization is dying. The only difference is that you're trying to frame innocent people for it, while I'm correctly naming you as the real culprit.

> Wow. Endorsing political violence are we now? I'm starting to get the picture. You're an Antifa sympathizer or an actual member. Your over-dramatization and hysterical remarks about Trump and his supporters only cement that belief even more. 

Oh, gods, no. I'm endorsing the American Revolution, the Union in the American Civil War, and the Allies in World War II. If you want to call that "political violence", then I guess that's technically correct, but it's hardly the same thing as endorsing running over protesters.

> Also, since when is America turning into a "nightmarish dystopia of alt-right-ism?! That's incredibly delusional. Is everything Trump does or doesn't "ALT RIIIIGHT!!!" for you? 

I would explain, but I don't think you're capable of understanding.

> I just gave you numerous examples. Is kidnapping and torturing a disabled kid not violent enough? Is nearly killing an old man for voting for Trump not violent enough? Is hitting someone dead center in the head with a bike lock not violent enough? Fuck you, you pathetic Antifa sympathizer.

NUMBERS. STATISTICS. ACTUAL HARD DATA. Not just a list of anecdotes. You want this to be a contest of which of us can memorize more atrocities, rather than which movement is actually more violent.

> Again with the over-dramatization and hysterics. You couldn't see the irony of your words and actions even if they poked you in your eyes. 

Of course I can see the "irony of my words and actions", as you perceive them. I'm not an idiot. You believe that liberalism is an Orwellian ideology that tries to persecute conservatism as a form of thoughtcrime. I think some of you might believe that we call people disagreeing with us censorship as well, maybe, although that's not as common as the Orwell thing. So yes, I do know why you think what I said is ironic.

Tell me, can you see the irony of *your* words and actions, as *I* perceive them? 

> I'm done arguing with you. Intellectual dishonesty and sympathy for ISIS and Antifa are something that don't fall quite well with me.

I wish I could say this was surprising, but it's not. You've definitely proven that you understand nothing about me, at least.

I won't even bother wasting my time with you anymore. Your brain is tainted and putrid beyond repair.

You reek of pseudo\-intellectualism. You're not revolutionary nor are you part of a movement that is going to save Western civilization. It's because of people like you that Western civilization as whole is being slowly destroyed from within. You're just another wannabe commie with delusions of fantasy utopias. Your kind has ALWAYS been on the wrong side of history, and will continue to be so.

I do commend you. You did have me fooled for a little bit. But I can't say I'm surprised it turned out this way.

Call me back when the all mighty Blue Wave hits, gays are in internment camps and the all mighty führer calls for the killing of all American muslims or when the communist Utopia is finally realized now that we're at it. Until then enjoy being a perpetual loser both in life and in spirit.

That is what being a corporate backer is like. Contributing to campaigns is the equivalent of investing. Investors control a market share of what they invest in, and therefore are required to obey lest they LOSE that backing.

You have heard politicians say 'I must vote based on the interests of my constituents'. In washington, corporate backers are the constituents.

$C: So you don't think calling obvious economic growth as stagnant is bashing? You really make zero sense you know. You contradict yourself in a single sentence. It's impressive.

And just because Obama said that, doesn't mean that 2% growth was all they saw. Remember, he was leading the country during the recession, slow growth was part of life back then. Look at the actual facts (that I posted and you ignored) about growth. I also have no idea what Amazon and Uber have to do with this, or even each other.

Also all the growth you see right now that you're giving to Trump, that's based on Obama's policies. I doubt Trumps own policies will improve the situation. With his idea that "trade wars are easy to win", he's gunna tank the economy with incredibly stupid and childish ideas like that.

It was though. The economy grew very slowly under Obama. Often times we had quarters with less than 1% growth. That is really bad. Obama is like the first president ever to not have a full years average be 3%. 

>And just because Obama said that, doesn't mean that 2% growth was all they saw. Remember, he was leading the country during the recession, slow growth was part of life back then.

You're really going with that?  Holy shit that's pathetic.  I mean, at least have the patience and persistence to ignore all logical facts, don't just *pretend it was to piss people off*.  No one buys that.  [You're this guy](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/738/025/db0.jpg) when you do that.

All you wanna do is get outside and ride your Big Wheel but you gotta do your spelling homework!  Man *literally everyone who types words* longer than my daytime singalong songs is a massive loser right? 

 *Imagine* trying so desperately to tag someone as just angry and *ass...blasted*(?) because you can't find well thought out arguments to support your own half formed views.

*Imagine* not being able to engage in an informed argument because you've never bothered to look outside your own echo chamber.

*Imagine* how many of these stupid petty attempts at insults you can lob back and forth at people.  

 But fo real son - You need to keep at your schoolwork and tend to your studies, because glorifying a lack of ability to read extended type is a pretty naive outlook in a place like ***the internet***    BTW how's it feel to be mentally taxing to write out over **6** sentences?  

Oh hey, is the guy who wrote out the ~~propaganda~~ link list **also** an *assblasted*(I seriously don't know why you chose this word) fool?  I mean, he wrote **77** sentences!  Surely that's also over **200 words**!  OR is he cool cause you agree with it?

Now, if you'd like to keep trying to insult me or whatever you think you're doing, you're more than welcome to.  You can't "win" by showing me much in the way of "proof", you can't "win" by goading me into some pissing match, so you must be trying to "win" by getting the last word right?.  So keep it coming.  I do NOT mind the extra typing, friendo.
$C: > It was though. The economy grew very slowly under Obama. Often times we had quarters with less than 1% growth. That is really bad. Obama is like the first president ever to not have a full years average be 3%.

Yeah, and often times there was quarters in the middle of the worst recession in how long? I keep pointing this out, you keep forgetting it. You're also comparing Obama to the pre-2000's presidents. Where growth was crazy, what happened then? OH RIGHT the dotcom burst, the housing crisis. That worst recession, there's me mentioning it again. And no, once again, the economy didn't grow very slowly under Obama. You're looking at GDP growth, not things such as job growth, stock market growth, etc. Which all grew under Obama.

> All those jobs he is responsible for are largely 1099 self employed people who have great services on the internet to help them make money.

If you're telling me that almost 12 million jobs are self employed people, then I'm really starting to think you're trolling.

> Lol. What policies exactly?

Lol. The policies that lead to unemployment record lows. The policies that lead to record stock market highs. The policies that Trump is claiming credit for now. Lol

> No it will be the complete opposite. I am sorry you are in favor of offshoring American jobs to slave labor factories in the third world. That doesn't bode well with me.

Oh yes. The age old "They took our jobs!" argument. It's a global economy. When did I say I want jobs shipped off shore? I didn't. In fact, what I want is America to be competitive in the global market. Which it won't be if it's in a trade war with other countries, especially friendly countries. But hey, don't let a little thing like logic and reason get in the way of your bias, you sure don't let things like facts!

You're expending all this effort as if there was a broader audience you're attempting to reach with your CNN virtue signalling, while in fact you're just weaponizing your pride with bevy of mental gymnastics and embarrassing dedication to a news source that actively exemplifies the polar opposite of your pedestal'd vision of them, for one person, who will just share this ridiculous hot air filled conversation with friends for a laugh, at your expense. 

You probably don't deserve that last zing, because at least you're passionate about something, but seriously mate, know what causes are worth your effort, and know when to call it a day.

You seriously think you're somehow doing *anything* to elicit something more than laughter from me?  So it's true, anything longer than 3 sentences in your mind is an emotion filled rant right?  So I obviously just pressed a button with my last one, since you're replying with **almost 3 actual paragraphs!**.  You must be sweating with rage on this one.

>CNN is a joke, any fanboy who defends them this hard is a joke and deserves nothing more than jokes.

Fox "news" is a joke.  CNN is a mediocre News Station that can barely get a story straight.  The difference is CNN is trying to report the news, while Fox barely makes an attempt tp report anything but how bad the "media" is to poor old repulicants.  

  > You just make it too easy and entertaining to not hit the "push for asshurt drivel" button.

 Sure.  Sure sure sure.  You can't find a valid argument from a hole in the ground (or your own rear end), but it was all for the lulz.  Not that your pretend reason makes any more sense.  

I have shown no indication of being "emotion filled" or "ass blasted" or whatever else 7th graders are saying these days.  But according to you, I'm "expending all this effort", which takes all of five minutes - that's a cup of coffee in grown up time - so "all this effort" surely translates into emotion, right?  If I had put any effort other that moving my fingers, like researching CNN's fake news infractions, collecting and editing screenshots, and posting them to an album, then maybe I'd be experiencing some sort of emotion on par with what you erroneously believe.  Hey, notice how I pointed out that you made an error, and not "fake news"?  Cause I know the difference between the two!

Whew lad, that's a rant.  *SOMEONE'S* emotional.  Hint - It's probably trump.  Nah it's you.  

Skipping the "expeding effort" part and lets go straight to where your reading comprehension fails.  

"as if there was a broader audience you're attempting to reach with your CNN virtue signalling"

A. look up "logical fallacies" and what they mean before you start throwing them around in your arguments.  Virtue Signalling , it's expressing morals or values for the express purpose of enhancing standing in a social group, perceived (or imagined}.  So, like, Say someone says Fox news is bullshit for the sheeple, then someone comes along to show them how wrong they are with a list of Other News Networks OMGFAKENEWS articles.  That second guy thinks he's gonna shut down all this phoney baloney talk and thrown down some truth y'all!  That's *more* likely to be Virtue Signalling than the first guy responding to and calling out all the copy pasta image macro garbage.

And B. - I do continue this bullshit for other people to see, but only because you can't muster up the "effort" (yeah right) to defend your own assertions.  See I don't copy paste memes as facts then have no clue how to defend it when it's torn apart.

>weaponizing your pride with bevy of mental gymnastics and embarrassing dedication to a news source that actively exemplifies the polar opposite of your pedestal'd vision of them.

OMG you don't see it.  You MUST watch Fox News.  Hunting down a post that was a reply once removed from your own comment,  "heckling" me instead of, ya' know, supplying any worthwhile information to support your"proof", or how most of it is hypocritical critiquing of the Left and feigning ignorance of the Right's similar actions...  


>for one person, who will just share this ridiculous hot air filled conversation with friends for a laugh, at your expense.

Wow I should shut up now if your Highly valued opinion, along with your classmates, are gonna make fun of me.  I like how "One block of text please" and "test post please ignore" are somehow *above* my own "hot air" in your opinion.  

 >You probably don't deserve that last zing, because at least you're passionate about something

Wow what a real zinger, I am emotionally crush I tell you.   Passionate about what?  Are we still on this thing where because I actually like typing I'm angry and ranting?  Sweet summer child.  I write more than this when I have an *actual research topic* to deliver.  It takes you longer to read this than it takes me to write it.  If you read at all anyway.  I doubt you will.  But that's actually the point here, one gish gallop for another.  Instead of posting low effort links, I actually had to type out ALL of these fucking words my self.  Sucks when people throw out a bunch of filler instead of keeping with the one or two strong points they might actually have, isn't it?  Cause now instead of arguing valid points(which we know you can't do anyway) you would have to either refute all, which would take longer than an audience is willing to last, or you pick and choose, to which your opponent says some asinine "*Ok, I'll concede one for you 76 to go, I'll wait.*
