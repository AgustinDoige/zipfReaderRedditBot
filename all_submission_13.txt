They noticed there was a blank wall at mcdonald’s so they decided to make this fake poster of themselves. It’s now been 51 days since they hung it up.

$C: Wanna impress me?  Sneak into a McDonald's and fix the ice cream machine.
$C: I dunno... I think that actually *is* a poster.
$C: It does look like a professionally made McDonald's ad.
$C: r/ActLikeYouBelong 
$C: Would had been better if they had posed with a Whopper and Burger King fries.
$C: IDK who OP is, but the guy that did this is one of my really good friends! He made a video about it if you want to learn more about how he did it. [Link](https://youtu.be/0rJHC6nY4F8)  :)

Also, [link to original Twitter post](https://twitter.com/jevholution/status/1036415320959930368?s=21).

Edit: No, they were not hired by McDonald’s for this. This is not a marketing campaign. Just a fun, weirdly extravagant prank. 

If you knew him, this is completely in vein of everything he does in life. Right down to the extreme attention to detail and “extra-ness.”

No, he didn’t drill holes into the wall (it’s command tape, so it’s not permanent and won’t be considered vandalism).

Yes, it’s still really hanging up at our local McDonald’s.

He’s an aspiring filmmaker and studies media production which is why he’s so good at design hahaha.
$C: Or.... Is this just a sneaky ad for Mcdonalds masking as a cool reddit post! I'm going to think this over with a McDouble and McFlurry.  
$C: My guess is this is typical "I thought another manager did this" type thing.  Promotions and advertisements get changed frequently enough .
$C: One of the mcdonalds in my town stretched a jpeg image of a fruit shake into a 8'x12' poster and each pixel is bigger than a quarter. It's glorious.

The best part? Some old person with 0 multimedia experience is holding that position down while there are recent grads looking for work that *actually know not to stretch a fucking jpeg to use on a physical advert* but somehow remain "unqualified".
$C: I mean shit, McDonalds should be giving them a job. That's very well done.
$C: Are the dotted circles re-spawning locations for fries?
$C: If I was that store manager I'd leave it up too. Looks professional af.
$C: I bet that manager couldn’t give two shits.
$C: *Hey Steve those kids are hanging a poster of themselves eating our product on the wall over there. As the manager I think you should do something about this very important matter. Steve? Why aren’t you doing anything? Steve? Oh my god they’re getting away Steve! Why don’t you care about this more - it’ll be up there for months unless you do something about it Steve. It’s almost like you don’t even care about this incredible job we have. I’m calling the FBI if you don’t do something about this Steve.*



$C: The manager probably knows it's not suppose to be there but it's so well done they probably said "fuck it. It's nicely done and goes with the store so let's keep it."
$C: Definitely the circles that did it. Random enough to be design, but not too much. 
$C: r/madlads
$C: They carried a massive picture into McDonald’s and hung it by drilling holes in a wall without anyone noticing?
$C: To be fair it looks like something that would be up 
$C: It's actually always been on my bucket list to do this at a hard rock cafe. Take a fancy black and white picture of yourself wearing a fur jacket or something, your face can even be  half covered or out of focus. Sign it with a black sharpie, frame it, sneak it into the restaurant in a purse or whatever. Then slyly find a blank space to hang it up (maybe just with some 3M sticky strips?) and hope that no one notices for a while. Keep going back to that restaurant once or twice a year to check on your fame
$C: may they end up in ellen
$C: If I was the manager there and I saw that someone had done that and had done it that well I wouldn’t take it down either. 
$C: This is a wholesome prank. What pranks were meant to be.
$C: Looks professional. Fits the message. And fills the needs of a blank wall beautifully. Why would they take it down. 
$C: We believe it 
$C: We did this in a GM office/factory in Ohio in the 80s.  At my residence we had this ugly velvet picture thing like they used to sell at roadside fleamarkets and the like.  We got this idea to post it on the wall for a lark.  We used simple masking tape on the back.  Me, being young and such just walked in the front door, down the wide hallway, and planted it on the wall so that it would be in plain view of all that entered.  It stayed up for 2-3 weeks, then must've fallen from weight.  One time we arrived at work to see two executives leaning on the wall, one on each side of the picture, discussing something.  Good times.
$C: My buddy Greg and I tried the same thing at Victoria's Secret. 

They apparently noticed two 38-year-old men with "dad bods" in lingerie was not "corporate approved" marketing. We were also banned from the mall, but I still feel like an angel. 
$C: That poster is dead on point!!!  Not too surprising nobody's noticed...
$C: Now this is humor
$C: Watch them get sued for using the logo 🤣
$C: [deleted]
$C: I know some people will be critical of this. But me? I'm lovin' it.
$C: The food and offers that are displayed on this post definitely makes this look like an ad.
$C: Fuck off

McDonald's is so heavily advertising on reddit 
$C: "Here's a McDonald's ad, but McDonald's *totally* doesn't want you to see it"

Lol
$C: Hey look, a McDonald's commercial on Reddit. Shocking
$C: Too bad McDonald's food sucks, and is overpriced.
$C: The fact that they must’ve had a photo shoot, edited, printed and snuck this into McDonald’s is really cute. 
$C: They should get paid for that 
$C: I'm lovin it
$C: Fuck you, viral marketing.
$C: I would totally believe that
$C: Great job on the marketing program to get a job in McDonald's marketing department. Send that resume in.
$C: May be a McDonald’s ad in disguise. Not sure...
$C: This is literally an ad for McDonalds
$C: Smells like a shill 
$C: 51 days, that means no one is working that ever saw the wall without the poster
$C: They did a pretty good job with it. 
$C: Update, OP?
$C: I hope this is still up
$C: Oh come on this is clearly hail corporate material. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: What a great prank.  :-/.  This seems like an ad post. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Sneaky sneaky
$C: Location?
$C: r/madlads
$C: I've never heard of this McDonald place before. Maybe I'll stop by some time. 

^^^^^^^^^^^/s
$C: Too many upvotes for this to not be a McD ad. 
$C: See also [cockeyed.com pranks](http://www.cockeyed.com/pranks/time_machine/time_machine.html) for more of this type of subversive shenanigans. Mall time machine prank in link. Thanks to Rob Cockerham for years of weirdness.
$C: Wonder if they go in asking for free things, saying it was part of the McDonald’s ad that they would get free food 
$C: How did you install that without anyone noticing?
Double sided tape?
$C: Wow i am hungry now 😋😋
$C: Its already been claimed as OC by every meme page on instagram
$C: Now corporate will track down this location and make them take it down. Thanks, OP.
$C: Would have been funny if they were wearing in n out shirts 
$C: This is called working for free. They essentially did all this work and printed the material and hung it up, and a multi bajillion dollar company gets free advertisement/artwork. 

But they did a very nice job, and it does look profesh as fuck, so upvote I did.
$C: I know its a prank for you guys, but corporate would pay for work like that lol.. i bet you could get them in every store and get a commission kicked at you for each one
$C: Why would they take it down?It looks really good.
$C: Beautifully done sirs.  I would recommend that you forward this whole Reddit posting to Mc Donald's headquarters and say that you are not looking for money but if you folks like our work we are available.  Big Mac's for life would be nice too, hint,hint.
$C: This is a total job application stunt. Not bashing it, it's brilliant. But totally a "hire me" type deal for all the reasons u/[PunchDrinkLove](https://www.reddit.com/user/PunchDrinkLove) mentions:

&#x200B;

>*"And it works on so many levels. For one, they're fit, which would give  the viewer the impression that McDonald's is good for you. They're of  two different somewhat ambiguous races, which should appeal to everyone,  indicating that McDonald's promotes diversity and is welcoming to  people from everywhere. Also, two individuals who have different likes  (in this case, a hamburger-lover, and a french fry fiend) can get along  and have a thoughtful and humorous conversation about, say, a royale  with cheese. They're possibly on campus, and therefore collegiate, which  means they're smart, so if you eat McDonald's you must be smart as  well. These Mad Men are going places."*  


&#x200B;
$C: They should take the exact same picture with Burger King fries and a McDonald’s drink.
$C: Please turn out to be marketing majors.
$C: Someone did this at a Time Hortons I worked at doing a satirical Camp Day poster. They must’ve done it on an exceptionally slow night shift because those posters were in pretty hefty frames. 

No one knew how long it had been there but apparently they checked the security tapes (I can only assume because there was bad language on the poster) and they were at least up there for a month. 
$C: Yo joke's on them McDonald's just got a free poster
$C: r/MadLads 
$C: One strapping that backpack makes it believable 
$C: Why would McDonald’s get rid of a professional-looking poster someone gave them for free...?
$C: That's not them. The earlobes give it away.
$C: Awesome!

&#x200B;
$C: August 28, 2016 I accidentally threw a box of ziplock bags onto one of the ceiling lights in the dairy section of my local Walmart. Still there.
$C: They look like father and son in the poster lol
$C: There isn't much hope for humanity when 99% of viewers can't tell that this guerilla marketing by McDonald's. McDonald's has also flooded sponsored links (normal ads) this week across Reddit.
$C: This is another McDonald's advert. Before this there was some guy painting and an old lady's birthday.

What's next? 'Ooh look, someone's eating their burger next to some conveniently located logo. Time to upload it to r/pics.'
$C: Lol #Jollibee
$C: That’s awesome!!! I love that kind of arbitrary chaos, keep up the good work and keep us posted. Love it!!!!
$C: That’s not actually a *fake poster* if we can see it.
$C: r/ActLikeYouBelong
$C: That's just unpaid acting.
$C: I threw a pickle at a wall in McDonald’s that stayed up longer than that. 
$C: Harold and Kumar strike again
$C: 51 days since some marketing shills came up with this triple layered marketing ploy to get on the front page of the worst website on the internet full of hiveminded degenerate scum


$C: tagged as marketing
$C: What do you mean "they decided" and "they hung it up"? It has the McD logo on it!  

I'm not usually one to yell r/hailcorporate,  but come the fuck on.
$C: His \#adulting shirt makes me ill
$C: McDonald’s has been on be front page a few times over the post few days. They really ramped it up. 
$C: I honestly wouldn't be surprised if they landed a job on Mcdonalds marketing team afterwards, knowing how these memes go.
$C: This is the kinda shit that happens when you don't do drugs
$C: This is advertising.
$C: McDonald's is now getting free advertising on reddit?  What idiots are upvoting this crap.
$C: Two idiots working for free.
$C: Good job McDonald’s!  Got your social media team working a holiday even!
$C: This is awesome lol. I’m waiting for the moment someone realizes it then in the picture and wants a selfie of them and their poster.
$C: I hope everyone realizes this is viral marketing. 
$C: This is some r/hailcorperate shit.
$C: Nice try McDonald's viral marketing team.
$C: This is the quality OC I come for
$C: This obvious McDonalds ad got gilded twice for a clever, false title. /r/HailCorporate is in full effect, here.
$C: This prank is equivalent to the Key & Peele bank heist skit. 
$C: Guys wait....

How do we know this isn't a ploy by McDonald's to get us all to check our local McDonald's for this poster and potentially order some food while we are there.

I don't trust this one. 
$C: Manager: “When did we get that poster over there and who put it up?”
Employee: “Not sure, I think someone from corporate put it up...”
Manager: “Oh that makes sense, looks good.”
$C: Sooooooomuch McDonalds advertising on Reddit lately. They're hitting this site hard.
$C: Fucking corporate shill
$C: how would they get a huge poster like that into the store without any employees taking notice, let alone hang it up on a wall and have time to make sure its aligned perfectly and not crooked?
$C: You beautiful sons of bitches 
$C: y'all really upvoted a McDonalds marketing campaign to the front page smh
$C: Nice innocent looking post reminding everyone about McDonald's on Labour day. Nothing to see here folks

/r/hailcorporate 
$C: This should catch on all across the Earth and McDonald's should promote it.  
$C: This is beyond awesome. I love how weird people are.
$C: Unless they get in trouble for using the M trademark 
$C: I misread the title as 51 years... I was so startled at how they seemed to have discovered immortality. 
$C: There are at least 3 McDonalds with 2815 in the address. 

If I were in town where the one that matches the photo is, I'd be tempted to drive over and check it out. My money is in "they CGI'd themselves onto an existing poster", which still takes dedication to the gag, but...

$C: These guys are ads material for sure
$C: I still can't spot the dickbutt?
$C: Can’t tell if genius customers, dumb employees, or both.
$C: https://goo.gl/maps/c6RaBK8mKg52

Pretty sure this is the mcdonalds
$C: I wonder how many people have seen them eating in front of the poster and thought: "Holy shit! It's them!".
$C: That’s a very expensive size to print. 
$C: "Hey ladies...oh, you say I look like this male model behind me? Yeah I get that a lot."
$C: Legit If I worked there, I would just be like I wonder when we got the new ad?
$C: If McDonald's is smart, they'll leave this up. It will attract customers wanting to see it and post pics of themselves with it on social media. They're no Wendy's when it comes to social media savvy, but they should still be able to realize they can't buy exposure like that themselves without looking all r/fellowkids

  


Of course, they probably will take it down out of fear of "encouraging others" to follow suit and put up more (possibly less appropriate/flattering to McDonald's) posters.
$C: The guys face on the right, that just staring into space trying not to laugh face, cracks me up. 
$C: True Heroes
$C: Can't believe that fry box isn't crushed. 
$C: It’s an im*poster*
$C: How did they get this on the wall without anyone noticing? Haha 
$C: this is a much more difficult stunt to pull if you're white lol
$C: Mcdonalds site does live circles 
$C: Someone got a promotion for doing nothing.
$C: One hour and already 27k upvotes? 
$C: 10/10
$C: The fact that they must’ve had a photo shoot, edited, printed and snuck this into McDonald’s is really cute. 
$C: Preditor Hamburglars set their sights on the prize,  but one has bad aim
$C: On point!
$C: r/madlads
$C: r/roastme would love this 
$C: Dude. 2 hour old post and this has already showed up in 3 separate Instagram meme accounts. Wow.
$C: I Think this is *Professional* poster
$C: Here is the video these guys made talking about this. https://youtu.be/0rJHC6nY4F8
$C: Good viral marketing mcd real funny see u at FUCK YOUJ
$C: One of them should have wore a "Make America Great Again" cap, just because riots
$C: Here's the full video of how they did it. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rJHC6nY4F8&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rJHC6nY4F8&feature=youtu.be) 
$C: It would be better if you had a competing food in your hands
$C: Why has McOnalds made the front page 3 times in the last few days!?
$C: Background from the posters and the light from the ceiling gives a good contrast.
$C: Nice stealth totally native mcd's advertising
$C: How do you "hang up" a "fake" poster?
$C: Mc Harold and Mc Kuumaar
$C: I think it would have been better if they had taken the poster photo exactly where they are sitting in the brag photo
$C: A free poster featuring free non-white models, plus free advertising on social media from genuine accounts, all bringing positive publicity? I'm sure McDonald's is furious!

These guys are some real r/MadLads!
$C: The holding of the products is perfect
$C: r/actlikeyoubelong
$C: Damn, none of the employees noticed! How'd you slap the poster up there without anyone noticing? 
$C: They should have been holding food items from a competing hamburger joint.
$C: I’m lovin’ it. 
$C: This smells like an ad.. and frying oil...
$C: Nice try McDonalds PR team.  
$C: What’s the point of the dotted circles
$C: Does McDonald's make me cooler or smarter? 

One of you is wearing glasses and the other a hat. Some great advertising!
$C: Is this an ad?
$C: If it’s a fake I’m jumping of a cliff...
$C: Only the fifth McDonalds advert top of all this week!
$C: They should've been holding Wendy's 
$C: I mean it's exceptional, sooo... might as well leave it up


notice the dumbass dotted circles that highlight the fries; see the backpack slung over one shoulder that says "male 16-24 student demographic casual"
$C: Who wants to bet that this is just a viral ad by McD? 
$C: Ide be more impressed if one of them had their nutsack out or something
$C: This should be on r/madlads
$C: r/madlads
$C: Looks like a real poster to me 
$C: What do you mean fake? It's clearly a real poster.
$C: No shit. Why wouldn’t a major company like McDonalds take advantage of their own narcissism. It turned into not only free advertising, but free labor, too. Congratulations, you’re willingly contributing to America’s obesity. 
$C: Nice ad, Wendy's is better.
$C: Fun fact: Rapper Pusha T wrote the jingle for "I'm Lovin' It," but doesn't own the rights.
$C: Management is on top of it as always.
$C: I can't tell if this is dumb and pointless, or absolutely genious.
$C: You guys should that this a step further and take the same pic in the same clothes at the same location, but you're eating food from other franchises. Start off with something similar, but see how far you can take it, like eating sushi from some takeout joint.
$C: Please tell me you were eating burger king burgers and just the fries were mcdonalds 
$C: That s why you don't eat at McDonald's 
$C: Haha gorilla!
$C: It captures the slick advertisement look perfectly. 
$C: Totally fake, no way they edited those perfect McDonald's circles in.
$C: What if  they were the fake ones...




Woke*
$C: See if they can get away with taking it back down.
$C: It would have taken almost no effort to keep the address out of this picture. Come on! I'm a fan, though.
$C: Can, can I say it? "I'm loving it!"
$C: I’m lovin’ it!

$C: Every french fry in the picture is vertical in the fry container.  That's not how mine come to me...
$C: I'm ^just ^^testing ^^^this ^^^^out
$C: What does it say of me when I go to the comments on stuff like this and look for the r/quityourbullshit comment, just to verify if it’s real or not. 
$C: This is an Advertisement!
$C: Gottem
$C: I don't believe people actually upvote this corporate bullshit. There must be some voting manipulation going on.
$C: I'm going to comment on this post lol
$C: Update?
$C: Should be awarded for free mac rest of your life for this genious
$C: Um, two of my McDonald’s has the same poster... 
$C: #**So basically McDonald's just got a free reddit-advertising hack.**
$C: So they've spent their own money to make a decent free ad for McDonalds. Not what I'd call smart. 
$C: This is sort of anti-r/hailcorporate, but it could be ironic r/hailcorporate. I'm torn. But This is a quality post though.
$C: "Mcdonalds tricks millennials into creating their advertising material for them" 
$C: Tell me - why should I believe the headline and that this just isn't two dudes appreciating the McDonalds ad they were a part of?
$C: r/madlads
$C: Hail corporate
$C: Thanks McDonald's Social Media Team for this ad, I mean totally 100% not fake story.
$C: Nice try, McDonald's.
$C: Wow that's so random! These two buddies eat at McDonalds all the time and were like "hey theres nothing on this wall. As a prank let's spend the day making a branded advertisement and then spend $100 to print it on a giant poster board." Can you believe they hung it up without anybody noticing and it just got left there?! It's almost like the whole thing was planned by McDonalds 
$C: r/hailcorprate 
$C: Wow! It looks like a *real* poster!
$C: Am I commenting on a McDonald’s ad right now?
$C: This post was paid for by McDonalds.
$C: It's not even bad art. Totally believable.

Give these guys a job in the McD's marketing department. Totally works for me.
$C: This post is literally an advertisement 
$C: Harold & Kumar Go to McDonald's.
$C: Hail Corporate 
$C: Yes, and look at that! Another McDonald's branded post, rising to the front page of Reddit. How shocking. How real. 
$C: These aren’t even the same people. This is literally a McDonald’s ad. 
$C: Fuck these blatant marketing posts. On second thought, fuck this whole sub while we're at it.
$C: I can't believe you people don't realize the story is fake, and this post is an advertisement for McDonald's.
$C: Got em?
$C: It’s very academic

$C: This is so well done and so funny
$C: Hilarious! They noticed, they just love it!
$C: That the funniest thing ever. 
$C: B.S
$C: Nice try, Macdonalds corporate!
$C: TWIST: They actually work as advertisers for McDonald's 

M E T A  
E   
T   
A
$C: Or, it's probably a mcdonalds ad we're looking at now.

Damn, im craving some borgars right about now.
$C: HAIL CORPORATE
$C: I detect a fake viral moment here
$C: This is called astroturfing, children 
$C: Love to create positive viral content for multi-national corporations to *stick it to the man*.
$C: Pjotoshopped. The burger actually looks edible. 
$C: That's what I call viral marketing 
$C: Nope. All wrong. Harold and Kumar went to White Castle, not McDonalds
$C: How are people not realising that this is an ad?
$C: Do another one where you're kissing. I bet it doesn't last 48 hrs. 
$C: This is legendary.
$C: Jeeeze marketing is next level now!
$C: What if this is a McDonald's ad and its top post?
$C: This is an ad. Why does it have 162k upvotes?
$C: The poster boys for sly stunts.
$C: The way he holds those fries is really throwing me off
$C: Madlads
$C: Way too steal their karma
$C: This is a Tide ad
$C: Now take it down and get arrested
$C: These guys just got promoted.
$C: ImPoster
$C: so does reddit steal from twitter or is it inverted 
$C: This is getting out of hand. Now There are two of them! 
$C: See you guys on the front page. 
$C: Would like to know how long this stays up. Keep us posted. Also if it is removed let us know what went up. I would not be surprised if they make one like it. 
$C: If its an ad, at least its funny... id never eat mcdonalds anyway so, to our corporate overlords, it didn't work.
$C: I don’t know man, the poster looks real enough 
$C: Can’t wait for the manager to see this on r/all and take it down

:(
$C: That poster makes me want some hot fries😝
$C: And now that people know its fake, its going to get taken down!
$C: That's so great! Good for them Man! That's cool!
$C: This is nearly in the same vein as /r/actlikeyoubelong

Edit: just noticed its already posted there.
$C: 2 people did for free what they could have done for money. Ba duh ba ba ba McDonalds is lovin' it
$C: If I was the owner or manager I would definitely leave it up.
$C: And the guy on the left might have just got us all with a casual circle. Damn they’re good
$C: The burger looks too perfect to be real. 
$C: "I could really go for a Big Mac about n.......FUCK I"VE BEEN MARKETED!!!!!!"
$C: I mean, it's a nice poster. Even if they knew it was fake why even bother to take it down.
$C: Troll Softly
$C: How do you sneakily perfectly mount a giant 5’ poster unnoticed?
$C: Be sure to take full advantage of being a McCelebrity. Now you just tell the manager you get free nugs cuz you fam.
$C: r/madlads
$C: Would have been funnier if they held competitor products in the pic, but prob wouldn't have lasted long.
$C: If they continued to do this at as many McDonald's as they could across the country and documented it, that would be a crowdfund I could get behind.
$C: This legitimately made me want some McDonalds fries.
$C: At least they didn't spend too much on the actual product.
$C: What's fake ? They made a free ad
$C: There are so many ways to hold a container of fries.
$C: wait till some completely new people work there, then order something, and if they want you to pay, just point at the poster and tell them you can eat for free, celebrity discount. 
$C: I know two guys u put up a small frame at ikea with a photo of them. It has been there for almost 2 years now they even moved the frame around between different rooms 
$C: Alright guys heres the idea of the ad campaign. Reddit inception, we'll take you, put you in a photo, and make a poster. Then we'll put you in a restaurant in front of a poster and pretend we didn't do any of this while we posted the result to reddit.
$C: Wouldn’t be surprised if McDonald’s social media marketing dept gave them a job offer
$C: Genius. If mc’ds were smart, they’d exploit this
$C: [If only one of them was doing this](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_B5E5HPIKKBY/TCgENnaXouI/AAAAAAAAAZs/JHip18_p03M/s320/Screen+shot+2010-06-27+at+10.08.28+PM.png)


$C: McDs is all over this post boosting it to number 1 post
$C: Nice try McDonalds, the situation surrounding the poster is fake. The food looks immaculate, just like a TV ad would represent it, and you just got the models to sit in front of it, while also keeping the food in frame. Fuck off.
$C: Pretty sure this is a real ad and the people were just posing with their poster. A lot of ads localize. 
$C: It captures their youth as they're dying on the inside from eating Mcdonalds
$C: hahaha some people just want to watch the world burn. 
$C: So the local McDonalds gets a free poster, and the guys who did it are going to have to frequent that McDonalds (buying stuff) to point out that the McDonalds got a free poster.

It would have been funnier if they'd had a Wendy's fries.
$C: Lol
$C: First challenge complete.

Now, can you do the same but with a subtle error or disconcerting artifact.  Like in a background group of people, out of focus, some dude has his dong out?
$C: I think we're being bamboozled, that poster looks real.
$C: r/madlads
$C: /r/actlikeyoubelong
$C: So there was a local restaurant where I live owned by this famous Country singer. Like it’s literally called [Famous Country Singer’s] Bar & Grill. And because he’s a very famous singer he had a lot of pictures with other famous people on the walls. It was like a thing there. They’d get the famous friend to sign it and they’d frame it in the same wooden frame and hang it on the wall. So my brilliant and funny father got a family picture of ours and had it printed in black and white and framed in a wood frame to match and signed it “From the [Tysonvictor] family” with a weird scribbly signature like the others. He went to the restaurant (with a small electric screw driver in his pocket) with a friend with the sole intention to get it put up without any of the employees knowing. He found a good spot and had his friend lookout (oh also my dads a 50 year old grown ass man when he did this) and they actually got the picture drilled into the wall (the other pics were framed and drilled in with two screws through the frame as well). It’s stayed there for about 2 years all the way up until my dad was telling the story and someone who heard it had a daughter that worked there and he told his daughter who told her boss and they found it and took it down. It was so epic while it lasted and we learned our lesson... never tell strangers about the joke. Now we have 3-4 similar jokes put up around town and no one will ever know. I love my dad lol. 

Imgur isn’t wanting to cooperate but I’ll post the picture of the picture if I can get it to work. 

Add: [Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/OATTryc) is the family pic drilled into the wall. It’s the lower right one 😂
$C: They gonna get hired as the new head of advertisement at mcDonalds 
$C: Life goals 
$C: If this were my restaurant and I found out about this, I'd easily throw these guys a couple gift cards, and even ask if there is a way they could get credit for it, however that helps them. It's flawless quality. 

Anyone here have any idea what it would cost to seek out a poster like this? I'm actually asking. 
$C: I don't know if it's because I'm inferring way too much into the ethnicities of these folks, but I'm getting a real Harold and Kumar vibe here, like this is something they'd try to do in order to obtain like a lifetime of free White Castle or something.
$C: He should have been holding a Whopper 
$C: That's because McDonald's sucks the soul out of its employees so they haven't noticed
$C: Nobody gets paid enough to care.
$C: I wonder how they hung it up
$C: Until today that the manager is in reddit
$C: Discount Harold and Kumar
$C: I mean, the poster *does* fit McD's ad campaign of "happy generic young adults who are happy and generic because they bought a Big Mac and fries."
$C: I saw it and went “ba dum ba da da I’m lovin it”

Brainwash advertising at its best. To McDonald’s!
$C: This might land them a job in advertisement. With the quality and execution of it I would hire them if I were a big business like McDonalds.
$C: Holy stolen content Batman.
$C: 4

$C: bosses. 
$C: I'm loving it.
$C: did they have the approval of McDonalds? 
$C: I realllly hope these guys are actually marketing majors and NAILING their coursework. 
$C: "we're just a couple of normal guys eating mcdonalds" 
$C: Diversity. 
$C: At what point do they bill McDonalds?
$C: On the back you should stick your business card. 
$C: This is amazing 
$C: Now its spoiled.
$C: The real test is hang it up in a Burger King
$C: I thought the wall had original McDonald's ad and these to models happens to meet at that particular outlet
$C: Hail Corporate 
$C: The guy on the right looks like an Asian Jordan Peele.
$C: I'm lovin it.
$C: It looks so professionally done, so I’m stuck between believing the title, and thinking they’re actually paid by Maccas to be in the poster, and that they’re just posing with it.
$C: How hard would it be to bring glasses and a hat for this photo?
$C: I envy such professional levels of tomfoolery 
$C: Saving this post, please update if it gets taken down I want to hear the story of the employees lol
$C: If you want to see how they did it, they made a [video explaining everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rJHC6nY4F8).
$C: This is fantastic marketing by McDonald's. Well done. I'm impressed.
$C: Ok? But who are they? Are they just random people? If so how did they hang up a poster that large without someone noticing? 
$C: I'm pretty sure the owner/manager knows about it but has left it up because it's an incredibly professional ad that they didn't pay money for.
$C: Oía
$C: This fake ad made me want McDonald's 
$C: Legends 
$C: R/madlads
$C: There was exactly 1000 comments before in posted this. Take that ocd!
$C: Or maybe reddit partnered up with McDonalds and this whole post was an ad from the very beginning?
$C: Look more like dude is being forced to hold other dudes fries while he eats his cheese burger
$C: Looks like these guys probably got a job offer.
$C: r/madlads
$C: Harold and Kumar Go to McDonald's
$C: Wouldn't it technically still be a real poster?
$C: Hmm... It looks like a real poster to me
$C: This is brilliant
$C: It always blows me away that people still eat McDonalds. 
$C: This is totally advertising .
$C: "Mcdonald's, have it your way"


Did I get that right?
$C: r/madlads 
$C: r/actlikeyoubelong 
$C: So what do you do?

Oh, this and that, a little modeling, you know..
$C: Awesome 👏 
$C: Is this Singapore?
$C: Subliminal messaging? Lol
$C: McDonald’s #17311, Lakeland, Florida.
$C: I doubt the 51 days part...
$C: Get that ad money 

$C: I'm lovin' it
$C: The new Harold and Kumar reboot looks terrible.
$C: What. I love McDonalds now!

&#x200B;
$C: They made one fundamental mistake...THEY DiDN’T GET PAID
$C: Seems like in Malaysia 🇲🇾 
$C: Now McDonald's owns their likeness for free FOREVER
$C: I am fucking hungry now thanks.
$C: squad goals
$C: Further proves that no one cares, at least in that McDonald’s, and except maybe reddit 
$C: How much did this cost? 
$C: You literally made a free ad for McDonald
$C: I don't care if it's real or fake.  It made me laugh, not want to buy a Big Mac.  It was entertaining people. Christ.
$C: His fingers grabbing the French fries are creepy as hell
$C: I’m lovin’ It.

$C: u/titletoimagebot 
$C: So nobody from the staff notices OR stops two guys walking inside with a big ass-portrait? And nobody stops these guys from drilling in the wall so they can hang up said portrait?
$C: im going to go drive though mcdonalds now, ARE YOU HAPPY MCDONALDS YOUR STUPID POST WORKED
$C: This is amazing
$C: Harold and Kumar go to McDonald’s
$C: There is a YouTube video on how they pulled out off

https://youtu.be/0rJHC6nY4F8
$C: Oh great another progress picture, “it’s been 51 days since we hung a poster.” 
$C: Looks like a real poster to me
$C: The maddest of lads.
$C: I like that the guy with the burger's forearm is making an implied line toward the garbage can. 
$C: And that's how you get hired by McDonald's marketing team
$C: if this is real, i bet McDonalds is gonna go looking for and then remove it now that its on reddit. 
$C: Prediction: McDonalds hires these two for a professional photoshoot to actually add them to their poster line up. That's what I'd do if I was McDonald's marketing PR.
$C: Shit, McD's needs to cough up some dough.
$C: Move the middle finger off the fries logo and hold the burger exposing the writing on the packaging and McDonalds might damn we'll pay you!
$C: This looks fun, Im going to put a poster inside my local mickey ds of me eating a big mac with the burger king king and see how long it stays there
$C: Why call it a fake? Its a very appropriate, well made poster for the McDonald's atmosphere. I would call a poster of kthulu a fake poster
$C: Kid 'n Kumar go to McDonald's.

&#x200B;

Is that racist?  Sorry if I'm being racist homeboi 
$C: r/madlads
$C: Video of how they did it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rJHC6nY4F8
$C: Who spreads their fingers that far?
$C: Ni no emoc.
$C: I love that the address is in the picture so it took like 5 seconds to figure out where this McDonalds is located. With this hitting the front page, it's gonna be down in a few days. Go see it while it lasts folks! 
$C: Im curious on how they got it hung up without any problems! Seems like a heist or some deal
$C: [Video is here](https://youtu.be/0rJHC6nY4F8)
$C: I don't think the poster photo is actually with the same people... The Indian guy looks different, as does the other guy. 
$C: Poster looks real to me
$C: gota' sneak some RtMark stuff in there, otherwise you're just working for free.
$C: r/madlads
$C: Studied graphic design in college.

What I like most about it is, it's not a *great* poster...but that's exactly the point. It's just good enough to look like it belongs in a McDonalds. If I was eating there, I wouldn't think twice about it. 

Nice job!
$C: Man that is a great poster.
$C: Circles on the poster in black, then circling the fries in white is the real eye catcher
$C: Is this viral marketing?
$C: This is just a McDonalds ad...
$C: Inb4 this blows up on reddit and the poster gets noticed and taken down
$C: All they did was make McDonalds a free poster
$C: Pure Awesomeness!
$C: If these guys aren't in marketing, they should be.

&#x200B;
$C: Mc MADLAD
$C: Nice
$C: This is McDonald's own marketing team.
$C: Fucking hero’s 
$C: More people should do that, make educated bold moves guys I know I.T. is good, but I'm better.
$C: Two idiots working for free.
$C: These guys are great Americans!

$C: Video is it being done https://youtu.be/0rJHC6nY4F8
$C: Anyway to validate this? Confirm it’s not viral marketing I mean?
$C: Looks like a YouTube thumbnail for a top 10 of something. 
$C: They just made a McDonals ad for free... should have hidden something slightly subversive in it McDonalds wouldn't want. 
$C: legends 
$C: Free advertising mcadees don’t mind 
$C: Florida or Texas one?
$C: lmao that is perfect
$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rJHC6nY4F8 

Video of how he did this.
$C: Fake it till you make it
$C: This will get caught in their yearly inspection my McDonald's corporate. 

When corporate shows up every single piece of marketing,as well as the entire place, is inspected.

They notice any old promotional material and tell you to take it down. They also find any place where they think an ad should go and tell you what poster to buy and hang it up.

They will find this.
$C: Orange shirt guy...not sure if hat or hair....probably hat.
$C: r/madlads
$C: I’m lovin’ it!
$C: Source: https://twitter.com/Jevholution/status/1036415320959930368?s=09
$C: lol 10/10 now they use this to show girls they are legit male models
$C: McDonald’s should pay them for this ad
$C: Yeah yeah I bet it's an official poster and those are just the two models having a pose in front of it


$C: Here's what I'm wondering. How did they get a poster that size hung up without any of the employees noticing? Unless one of them works there and they hung it up after the dining area closed which is a possibility.

Edit fixed a typo
$C: This has no effect on me. All of this talking about McDonald's has made me hungry for a quickly prepared burger done well at any of the many convenient locations near me.
$C: That's taking narcissism to a whole new level.
$C: Is that how big a large fry is? Jesus christ.
$C: Looks like the Pearland, TX location. There's a Whataburger less than a kilometer away, smdh.
$C: Lmaooo I love these guys 
$C: r/scriptedasianposters
$C: I'm lovin it
$C: I’m loving it.
$C: I’m loving it^TM

*astroturfing intensifies*
$C: Aw man... Bottom left corner. He fuckin got us. (*punches his own shoulder*)
$C: Free graphic design work..
$C: They should get a bonus for initiative and creativity. 

Furthermore, it'd be awesome if McDonald's took this idea and ran with it. Giant posters of long time employees in promotional advertising. 
$C: I'm lovin' it!!
$C: *See's this 

*Texts best friend* "hey I got this idea"


$C: calling the cops
$C: Lol McDonald’s employees don’t give a shit
$C: It has a look of authenticity, of capturing a real moment rather than a staged event. If I were McD, I'd pay them a shit ton of money and use that image everywhere.
$C: I work at 7 eleven and we can’t even put a 1cm sticker anywhere 😂
$C: Is this the US embassy?
$C: Things that make you go hmmmm...
$C: Why have a marketing team when your customers market for you!
$C: r/mademesmile
$C: ITT: People with zero understanding of advertising/marketing, insisting that McD should give these kids jobs with their Corporate marketing team. 
$C: MAD LADS
$C: That’s hilarious 
$C: r/madlads
$C: Doing there part too making eating at McDonald’s a little less depressing 
$C: Lol nice
$C: Very sneaky
$C: r/actlikeyoubelong
$C: Isn't this exactly as the work of a professional but with the minor detail that you aren't getting paid? 
$C: This post, along with the 64k upvotes, has really convinced me to go out to the nearest McDonald's™ and indulge in the deliciousness of a Big Mac™ or Quarter Pounder™ with a side of juicy Chicken McNuggets™ and a nice large Coca-Cola™ to wash it all down. 

I'm loving it!™
$C: /r/madlads
$C: I see new beginnings and a fresh start, a new soft drink, two for the price of free. :)
$C: This is absolutely amazing 
$C: Yea that's staying up forever 
$C: Sah-weet
$C: Where is this?!
$C: This is not from the Philippines isn't? 
$C: My high school would have a charity day every year where they would get a ton of hamburgers from McDonald's and all the kids would bring them to those in need.

My brother participated the year they were remodeling the McDonald's so they used a picture of him on the wall.
$C: Well it's coming down now
$C: Absolute r/madlads
$C: I wish I was this clever
$C: mcd should start this as a feature. Allow customers to pay and put their posters in the wall. If not for food, but to see themselves people will surely come to the restaurant.
$C: Well it still advertises their food in a positive light, so idk if they ever will take it down. Looks really legit anyway.
$C: Missed a chance to 👌🏾 
$C: Oh man hilarious you made an ad for them you really got them good.

I dunno maybe if your dick was out or there was a hidden reference or something this would be funny but really this is just a free ad that they happen to be in.
$C: Pretty close! There is a garbage can in shot which showd trash in general, the m on fries is covered, and the frame should be tighter as in a little above waste. The lighting looks darkened, but overall fine. I dont think the dots are necessary but color temp should definitely be on warmer side
$C: Sounds legit.....
$C: It's an im-poster. 
$C: Reddit sure does have a lot McDonalds ads lately and it’s going right over our heads
$C: What a nice resume addition. "Produced marketing materials for international corporations" 
$C: Love you guys so much!

$C: Getting some guerrilla warfare advertising vibes 
$C: The claw grip on those fries is triggering me
$C: Why is there so much McDonald’s theme post on the front page now? Pretty suspect
$C: I dont know why, but I find this more funny than it should be.
$C: OP we'll need an update in a week. I bet gold that an email will be sent to all location managers tomorrow morning to find this and remove it
$C: My local McDonald’s are still stuck in the 90’s decor so they could use something like this
$C: r/Madlads
$C: That’s brilliant love it 
$C: So they paid to become an advertisement for McDonald's?
$C: Anyone else want to find this McDonald's and have their picture taken in front of the poster?? 
$C: They should get free fries for life now
$C: One of the best job applications they have ever received.
$C: Lol
$C: I'm love'n it
$C: Why isn't this on r/latestagecapitalism where people are putting up ads for McDonald's on Reddit for free?
$C: Look at these hip students enjoying a quick meal during their busy schedule. If they can do it, so can you. Cus who’s gonna stop you? Cus you’re the boss. Eat what you want, but we’d prefer it if you ate McDonalds. Enjoy. 
$C: Still not eating your food McDonald’s 
$C: I dunno guys, reeks of guerrilla marketing to me. Either the guys are trying to get noticed by a ad agency or they already work for a ad agency that works for McD's. I'm going to wear my monocle for this one
$C: Dammit, I've always wanted to do this at an applebees.
$C: Look up the Oxford Dictionary definition for Ballers and it’s this post.
$C: As if none of the staff noticed the putting it up
$C: Tom Green already mastered this. He hung his own painting in the National Gallery of Canada and then went back weeks later on a tour and defaced it. He then ran from security.
$C: I mean, it's a real poster. 
$C: +77k for such an obvious marketing post after 3 hours? 

Really, Reddit?
$C: Watch them get sued for using the logo 🤣
$C: It’s interesting how a bite hasn’t been taken out of the burger or even one chip has been eaten .

Either a good effort to make it like a genuine poster or it IS a genuine poster .
$C: If the guy on the left were to move his head you would notice. The other guys penis was out on the poster.
$C: I would seem legit if the M wasn't covered up on the fries
$C: The McDonald's probably knows but let's it stay because it actually looks like one of their ads. The guys are even in pretty decent shape so they can keep saying their food isn't bad for you. 
$C: /r/mildlyvandalised
$C: And now they have jobs with McD's corporate. 
$C: Burger, fries but no drink? Clearly fake..

Which actually makes it seem more like an official poster really..
$C: Ducking legend. 
$C: How did they put the thing up without anyone noticing ?
$C: More please, cute dudes
$C: I feel like they would keep it up even if they knew
$C: So its just free advertising for a multi billion dollar company?
$C: /r/actlikeyoubelong
$C: Am I the only one bothered that the burger is not dot circled?
$C: What does that even mean? Such a bad ad. 
$C: Prepped!
$C: Two legends 
$C: Legendary hahaha
$C: Legends
$C: Top kek
$C: They could spin this into a promo, like poster of the week, and select the winners from Instagram etc.
$C: Ba da Ba BA BAH!
$C: That poster is anything but fake! 
$C: "Real people, Not actors"

&#x200B;

Works for Chevy, it can work for us! /s

$C: Looks like a real poster, not a fake one. 
$C: That's f****** awesome. good for you guys
$C: Adulting?
$C: They will probably try to come after you for using that logo. 
$C: My new personal heroes! :D
$C: Sneak Level : Legends 
$C: Compensation 
$C: Are they getting paid?
$C: Mcd's should keep it up
$C: So well done!
$C: When you sell yourself for a small fry. 
$C: The tricky part was finding food good enough to be on a poster.
$C: Spec work...
$C: They think they pranked someone, Mcdonalds is just like, "Cool! Free multi-cultural advertising!"
$C: I see two nice
$C: LOL
$C: I’m oddly craving McDonald’s now. Thank you for that. 
$C: McDonald’s, if you have any sense, you will take advantage of this, pay them, and plaster this damn thing all over the place.
$C: This is... cute? Why is this cute? I don't know why I find this cute. 
$C: Love it, Fabulous❤️
$C: Mcdonalds can fuck off.  
$C: I read 51 years, I was confused
$C: These guys are incredible. Genius
$C: If you're good at something, never do it for free.
$C: 52 days since the GM has come by
$C: M
$C: A lost opportunity to culture jam. They should've been holding fruit.
$C: This is one of those funny harmless pranks.


I can see some manager with a bunch of keys jingling on his belt getting upset though 
$C: How many dates have you gotten from sitting under it?
$C: Very funny!
$C: Are those really even the same guys?
$C: McDonald’s is sponsoring this post 
$C: This is hilarious
$C: The poster looks real to me. 
$C: It's at the [McDonald's at Broadway and 288 South in Houston,](https://www.google.com/maps/place/McDonald's/@29.5568017,-95.3913265,303m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m8!1m2!2m1!1smen's+warehouse!3m4!1s0x8640933214f685c3:0x29881e2d5cbafe8c!8m2!3d29.5568766!4d-95.3908995) if anyone wants to go check it out.
$C: pranking done right
$C: 100k upvotes in 3 hours?
$C: Let’s just call this the “poster challenge” so that everyone on Facebook can start doing this as well. 
$C: How on earth do you hang up a fake poster? seems like a real poster to me ^^
$C: Hilarious!! I look forward to seeing more of these elsewhere 
$C: I'd like it more if they were laughing at salads. 
$C: This post made my day. thanks for the laughs, It looks like a fully legit McDonalds poster, No one would ever suspect a thing because its so well made. 
$C: that's really a poster tho 
$C: The guy on the right is pulling a chord shape on his fries, what is that?..

$C: The fuck does a fake poster mean?

$C: Looks like a clip from a commercial. Extraa
$C: 4 hours in and its at 116k upvotes. This will be in the top of all time. 
$C: Well. They should keep it. It's a nice advertisement poster. 
$C: That's a real poster.
$C: #adulting
$C: RemindMe! 2 hours
$C: Not anymore. 
$C: That's a lot of karma
$C: And it’s probably down now 
$C: Very professional, except they spelled "i'm lovin' it" with a lower case "i".
$C: That picture. I get the guy on the left eating a quarter pounder, but the guy on the right? Who just orders a large fry? I guess maybe he's holding them for the other guy? I need answers.
$C: So the staff just let this 2 dudes drilling holes to hang up pic on their wall?

$C: u 
$C: /r/madlads
$C: They noticed there was a blank wall at mcdonald's, because the mcd's viral marketing team is them, and they were paid to make an ad, and so they did.

So they posted it here!  It's now been 5 hours since this was on the frontpage of reddit!

(because who the fuck is going to pay a 500+ dollars to advertise for mcdonalds as a "joke?")
$C: comment
$C: But ... I thought Harold and Kumar go to white castle?
$C: They're out full force on the comments even if this is organic 
$C: Pitch perfect corporate pseudo-art.
$C: Shit, I thought Harold and Kumar went to White Castle!
$C: I'm 96% sure I've been to this McDonalds and this is not hanging up. Unless there's another McDonalds in Suite 2815.
$C: Yo these are some real mad lads
$C: When I was in high school we ran inside or McDonald’s and tore down the Brittany Spears window poster things they chased us out.
Good thing we had a getaway driver!
We put them up on my moms windows and they were the talk of the party. Pretty sure at that age it went into somebodies spank bank.  *pretty sure*
Ahhh. Those were simpler times.
$C: Almost like the Hitler portrait I hung up in the classroom.
Except I edited Obama's Head over it.
It has been there for half a year now.
$C: The absolute Madlads
$C: Madlads
$C: Since no one else did r/madlads
$C: bruh 😂
$C: #adulting
$C: Those guys know how to party
$C: Omg....I found my depression cure!
$C: That poster looks a lot like the area outside of the Student Union at Oklahoma State University, trash can is the same too. In fact that McDonald's looks like the one on Main St.
$C: Maybe they never noticed
$C: $50 well spent.
$C: McDonalds should hook them up with a poster designing deal or coupons!
$C: Me and some friends did the same with a fake sports team photo of us in the hallways of our old school. Lasted a few months
$C: [deleted]
$C: They should get paid. 

Edit: OK. Thinking this is fake now. 
$C: You guys are great! How did you get it on the wall without the staff noticing you (were they cleaning the ice cream machine) 
$C: Life imitating art.
$C: Actually being in a McDonalds long enough to notice the decor???
$C: They made the fake poster since they noticed there are no Asians on posters they’ve seen. Glad it stayed up!
$C: Damn you autocorrect!
$C: Can you please video tape people walking by and noticing... that would be greeeat.
$C: And...? 
$C: No matter how sure I was, I couldn't ask if that was them though. 😐
$C: 😂😂😂😂😂
$C: Knew this guy in highschool... wow
$C: I'm a MCGAYYYYYYY
$C: It like legit looks like it belongs there
$C: Anyone else think of *Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle*?
$C: So obviously astroturfed. why is this allowed to happen? Because reddit is a big corporate advertising/propaganda machine
$C: Self serve.
$C: It won't last now because someone had to post this online.  Otherwise it'd go prob until the next series of ads are required to be hung up
$C: Saw this on twitter lol 
$C: Lmao
$C:  R/mildlypenis
$C: 51 days later and still cant geta mc job!
$C: That what I call McMutha Fackin lovin it!
$C: Provide the file. We should be helping the political turmoil but a grassroots McDonald’s ad campaign sounds hilarious.
$C: After seeing this poster, I want some mcdoubles. 
$C: It's now been 52 days...
$C: Para pa aaa paaaaa
$C: Huh, just realized I'm not handsome enough to be in a McDonald's poster. *Damn you genetics*
$C: Good job you guys. Well done.
$C: Legend prank.
$C: Genius
$C: lv
$C: They should honestly mention this in their resumes
$C: This is the 3rd time I've seen this posted
$C: r/actlikeyoubelong 
$C: Won't last long now!
$C: plot twist - McDonalds hires these two as models for future advertising.
$C: Until now
$C: Very cool


$C: @ r/ActLikeYouBelong
$C: great idea.
$C: Great bonding
$C: This wasn't a McDonald ad campaign more than the guys wanting to have asian presentation in the store.
$C: First of all, how do they just walk in the door with that huge thing and no one notices??? It looks to be mounted on foam core board. 
$C: I'm should be capitalized, but otherwise I like it.
$C: About the poster?  I think it's was a neat idea.  Bravo.
$C: Really 4we🖐🏾🎐🎐🎐🎐🎐🎐🎐📑eY’all a
Great waysjal A is f f
$C: Asian Key & Peele
$C: The real reason these two gentlemen put their picture up was because there was no portraits of Asians.
There were portraits of almost every ethnicity but Asians.

$C: Someone left a chili powder shaker next to the cinnamon tray for some reason at a local Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. It was always there for weeks and I sometimes heard people complaining about their coffee being funny due to obvious reasons...but I don't know what they were expecting when they put bright red powder in coffee.

I finally asked an employed about it and nobody had any clue to why it was there. But it is STILL there till this day even after the manager looked at it. 
$C: That's awesome!
$C: nice awesome
$C: r/madlads
$C: go to a  McDonald's  and rob the store 
$C: The manager, "Huh, I thought corporate said they would inform me of new decor before installing. Looks good though!"
$C: If I remember correctly, CBC News ate this shit up for the "Diversity"points
$C: i purchased a Big Mac about 15 years ago i forgot and left it on the fence in the rear yard. it was there for 2 months the bun was dried up but the hamburger was as the day i put in 0n the fence. sodium nitrate so full that the meat was truly unedable. even fresh.
$C: Very professional photo though! Looks like a real Maccas poster.
$C: The story: [https://www.inc.com/chris-matyszczyk/a-man-noticed-lack-of-asian-faces-on-walls-of-his-local-mcdonalds-what-he-did-next-was-truly-brilliant.html](https://www.inc.com/chris-matyszczyk/a-man-noticed-lack-of-asian-faces-on-walls-of-his-local-mcdonalds-what-he-did-next-was-truly-brilliant.html) 
$C: How did they get the poster and the Mcdonalds logo on it in the bottom left?
$C: The 'i' isn't capitalized in bottom right of the poster
$C: Omg, this was 11 days ago and its hit top of all year already!! WE DID IT REDDIT!
$C: LOLOOOO THAT IS AMAZIXNXLY FUNNNNNNEEEHH
$C: From what I heard, they did it because there was no Asian folk in their posters. Lol
$C: I love this so much 
$C: Crazy Middle Class Asians 👌
$C: Absolute mad lads
$C: They made 50k off this stunt. Good on them
$C: saw this on Ellen, awesome job boys!
$C: Lpt: Replace "we" with "they" on any popular posts for instant karma! 
$C: Is it still there?
$C: Ice Cream machines next!
$C: Still up?
$C: Noice
$C: Legendary. 
$C: Update? Still there?
$C: r/madlads
$C: It is very interesting.  How about instead

* be seen with product from a competing chain (e.g., Wendy's);
* make promotional promises (fake family activity night);
* use other company's intellectual property (e.g., Disney);
* promote fake products; and/or
* encourage McDonalds workers to unionize.

I went to McDonalds and saw a poster promoting "Family Activity Night" with coloring, cookie decorating, arts and crafts.  The poster had my kids favorite super heroes on it - so they noticed it.  We came back specifically for "Family Activity Night".  There was no "Family Activity Night."  I was pissed.
$C: Nice try McDonald's.  I'm still not eating the shit you peddle.
$C: Fuck everything about this.
$C: Literally an ad as the top post. The absolute state of plebbit in 2018...
$C: Real life harold and Kumar without white castle
$C: My only question is how they were able to put it up without management noticing. When I work in McDonald's the supervisors would keep an eye on everything that went on in the store 
$C: The corporate fakeness of all of this 

Reddit giving this fake upvotes by the fucking thousands, actual poster 

Ugh
$C: Typical from redditors to upvote a literal ad for a billion dollar company. Get a fucking grip people.

>“I work with a number of accounts on Reddit that we can use to change the conversation. And make it a bit more positive.”
This was the startling admission of a professional-looking marketing agency that, in a phone call with me, openly bragged about manipulating conversations on Reddit.

https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/3-tips-for-creating-an-effective-marketing-strategy-for-reddit/

>In May 2018, Reddit overtook Facebook as the third most popular website in the U.S. This revelation closely followed their announcement of a redesign, the first in a decade. Reddit’s newfound media presence has industry insiders hustling to develop effective strategies to tap into their engaged user base.

https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/309778

>Though sometimes the site is in the news for users’ occasional bad behavior, the vast majority of those holding registered accounts are there to pursue their passions and interests. So, that should be of interest to business owners, because Reddit is a dynamic and thriving space for building an online community.


http://observer.com/2013/02/hail-corporate-the-increasingly-insufferable-fakery-of-brands-on-reddit/

>Despite the community’s penchant for skepticism, Costco, Taco Bell (in fact, most of the Yum! Brands) and a handful of startups have all made very conspicuous appearances on Reddit in the last year–not via paid ads, but through what at first glance appear to be organic and genuine discussions by Reddit users.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2016/12/14/how-we-bought-reddit-for-200/#6aa3557c44a8

>Reddit’s upvote system can easily be gamed with some bitcoin and a few useful contacts. I know this because my colleague Phil Harper and I successfully managed to place two made-up stories on to influential subreddits /r/UnitedKingdom and /r/Video, which have a combined total of over 13 million subscribers (12 million at the time of our investigation), both of which reached the number one and number two spots. How? With fake accounts and fake upvotes we bought for under $200.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/twitter-bots-trump-clinton-1.3814386

>These automated accounts can seem real enough, with pictures of real people and posts that certainly sound like they are human, as well as geolocators that appear to place them in the U.S. Some are so convincing that people — real people — get into prolonged arguments with them. Frustrating enough fighting with humans online. But battling a bot on Twitter? No amount of wit will win that one.

>Some experts on digital campaigns think the idea of launching a paid army of “former reporters, bloggers, public affairs specialists, designers” and others to produce online counterattacks is unlikely to prove successful. Others, however, say Clinton has little choice but to try, given the ubiquity of online assaults and the difficulty of squelching even provably untrue narratives once they have taken hold.
$C: Made my day!
$C: Nicely done. Only thing I could've done better was move that french fry box. Move the angle so that the light isn't shining on it and the advertisement is more apparent. That way, it's more clear that this is by McDonald's, not by some other company. And while yes, it is kind of obvious, in advertising, you want everything to be explicit.
$C: I hope this becomes a trend. 
$C: r/madlads
$C: Saying it's been 51 days makes this sound fake af. Real stories say things like "about 2 months" or "8 weeks ago" or list a date it occurred on. 

I'm calling shenanigans
$C: Using trending tweets to whore karma? Reddit has sunk to a new low 
$C: I think McDonalds marketing agents are seeing a market in reddit. Don't give those sly fuckers your upvotes. I'm not a betting man but I'm willing to bet this was done by McDonalds Corp along with those atgbe eyebrows.
$C: I reported this to McDonald's corporate number and they said they would look into it. 
$C: I'm not convinced they willingly went into a McDonald's and sat down to eat. Do people even do that anymore?
$C: I'm calling bullshit. They just happen to be the models in the advert. 

I'd like to see someone walk an image that size through McDonald's and then proceed to hammer the necessary nails into the wall without anyone coming around to see what's going on. 
$C: r/madlads
$C: Fake news
$C: Plot twist: they are marketing consultants doing grass roots outreach for McDonald's and you all have just been played. I'm lovin' it!
$C: This right here is a fucking mcdonalds ad in disguised. Fuck this shit.
$C: ♫do-do-doo-do-do♫
$C: Fucking mad these lads!
$C: R/hailcorprate
$C: Gets taken down now... BUT McDonald thinks it's so cool that they hire them
$C: Possibly the most wholesome prank ever. 
$C: That's hilarious!
$C: If I was the manager and knew it was fake of course I would leave it up.  It is way better than their normal ads.
$C: Don Draper and Roger Sterling
$C: #pay reddit for this advert
$C: this is a win for McDonald's.  someone decided to create ads for them for free.  looks professionally done.  I like it.
$C: Harold And Kumar Go To McDonald's And Have A Good Time.
$C: r/madlads
$C: I’m lovin’ it
$C: Bud up bup bup ba 
$C: What absolute mad lads
$C: Haha these are my kind of people. I love it. 
$C: So they made an ad for an enormous corporation for free. Praise capitalism… 
$C: It’s more beneficial for the local McDonald’s to leave it up since these guys (likely) come to McDonald’s pretty often just to see if the poster is still there. There are probably tons of their friends who also go to McDonald’s to check it out. Sales are increasing fellas! 
$C: real poster, merely unsanctioned.
$C: Now they should sue them for using images of them without permission.  lol
$C: Its free advertising so yeah theyll keep it
$C: 'OMG YOU'RE THE GUYS FROM THE POSTER'

must be fun.
$C: Lol wow you stole their post and literally reposted it for karma and you got gold. You are the biggest price of shit that I’m envious of today. 

Go to hell!
$C: How is it fake? It looks like a real poster to me. Just sayin.
$C: this is amazing
https://twitter.com/Jevholution/status/1036435742145368065
$C: I don't think they notice much. Back when Disney's *Hercules* was being promoted by McD's, my (now ex-)husband stole me a huge poster cling off one of the glass walls of our local McD's. We rolled it up and brought it home, no questions asked.
$C: 125k upvotes in 4hrs. That is some serious numbers!
$C: When you're a [GIANT CORPORATE FAST FOOD CHAIN], the money you use to buy upvotes is chump change.

Drink up the delicious Kool aid everybody.

This isn't an ad, right guys? Right?

r/woosh
$C: These guys could get a job in advertising as the sign looks legit.  I just don't think McDonalds needs anyone doing pro bono work for them.
$C: Now sue them for using your likeness without permission.
$C: My buddy did this in high school, but his photo matched the black and white aesthetic of all the other pictures on the walls. The photo was him and his buddy playing beer pong and it was there for months at least. This McDonald’s was right next to the high school so he became somewhat of a small town legend.
$C: “...and that’s how I got a job in McDonalds marketing”
$C: This is really well done. And props to them for resisting the urge to dickbutt it up. If McDonalds was smart it would award them scholarships and turn amateur advertisement creation into an annual contest. 
$C: New age reddit. Paid for advertising pretending to be something else. How shit
$C: That's hilarious. I've been a shift manager (not at mcds tho) and I'd just assume the GM put it up. Who knows what the gm thinks about this poster tho.
$C: Somebody please help me. Someone mentioned this might be an ad and now I want to kill myself for having looked at it. 
$C: How the hell did they just walk in , drill a hole, and hang something up without someone questioning them though 🤔
$C: r/madlads
$C: Jokes on them Mcdonalds got free poster, advertising, reddit front page.
$C: McDonald's employees:  
"Don't get paid enough to care."
$C: This is arguably the funniest shit I have ever seen. 

I really want to know how long it stays there. I'm going to say at least a year. Possibly several before they are actually sent a new promotional poster.... and even then they may put it up in a completely different spot out of laziness. 

Plus,  It's original Art, there's no real reason why they should take it down.
$C: r/MadLads 
$C: /r/ActLikeYouBelong
$C: Hey OP! Want to know how to truly tell if it is professional work? Do a ctrl-F and search "/r/HailCorporate" 

If people are accusing you of being a shill, well, it doesn't get much more flattering than that! 
$C: Fuck this is dumb.
$C: Bhaaaahahahaha right on 
$C: Fucking losers. 
$C: I like it two gay men enjoying a burger and some fries. "McDonald's! It's fabulous in so many ways."
$C: Those crazy McAsians.
$C: But could you pull this off if you were white?
$C: Legendary.
$C: Why would McDonalds care if a couple of idiots decided to take time out of their lives to give them a free advertisement.  Everyone else got paid.  Idiots.
$C: Stupid cunts. Couldn't they put some effort into a cause that doesn't support mass farming and single use plastics?
$C: r/madlads
$C: Yeah... like that would ever happen. And McDonald's never knew that picture was hanging there, right?
$C: OutSTANDing!
$C: Who are they?
$C: That's awesome.

$C: Haha awesome 😂
$C: Neat.
$C: Thats awesome
$C: I, too, could post a meme and its caption verbatim that I found on Instagram
$C: /titletoimagebot
$C: Well it’s gone now
$C: That's a really good poster.
$C: Nice work
$C: Damn. It’s working. Now I want a quarter pounder deluxe. 
$C: Looks like they added a black outline around the logo in the corner. That's gotta be against brand standards.
$C: For a second I thought I was on r/madlads
$C: When even the posters r/actlikeyoubelong
$C: r/actlikeyoubelong 
$C: Very Banksy 
$C: lol should try something like this sometime
$C: Get it! Lovin’ It! As they say!
$C: I'm lovin' it 
$C: I'm lovin' it! 
$C: Haha so authentic.
$C: But what if it **is** actually a mc donalds ad?
$C: But they didn't have a print release from McDonald's to use the logo. Office Depot shouldn't have produced this order. (Copyright laws are kinda dumb anyway tbh)
$C: Guy on the left from another planet
https://i.imgur.com/1QlUlCq.jpg
$C: If I were these guys, I'd put that poster up, leave it there for six months, and then replace it with an identical poster with the two of them in the exact same pose, but with their dicks out.
$C: Fucking dead
$C: Assuming that thing is 36x48 (no math was done -- just guessing) and printed on satin, that would cost roughly $48. If they also had it mounted on foamcore, that would add another $45.

So, is it worth $100? Eh, maybe.

Edit: Just watched the YouTube video on this. Cost ~$85, but was on heavy stock instead of satin.
$C: How do you know this is a McDonald’s ad? The “amateur” picture they took and “snuck” on the wall has a perfectly shaped hamburger in one hand. Nice work, McDonald’s, you sneaky b*tch.
$C: Who cares ? I don't understand the point of this I guess ??
$C: I'm loving it
$C: Yea give a multi billion dollar corporation free advertising...👏👏
$C: I'm loving it.
$C: Viral marketing is getting pretty creative nowadays I gotta admit.
$C: This is such a well executed prank it’s like those stupid, beneficial pranks from The Dana Carvey Show. Steve Carrell and Dana laughing hysterically. You did them a favor. Still hilarious. 
$C: Only flaw I see: garbage can on the left. I don’t want to see garbage when I’m thinking of eating. I’m not George Costanza, after all. Otherwise, perfect job!
$C: How illegal is that?
$C: McDonalds should hire them in their marketing dept!
$C: I’m busting a gut here!! Nice work fellas!!
$C: This is a McDonalds ad. They didn't 'notice' shit.
$C: Where is this McDonald’s at?? 
$C: I think it's the actual poster. 
Dude in the left gives it away. Both different guys.
$C: What a crazy marketing strategy... Interesting.
$C: McBanksies 
$C: That is awesome!!
$C: This makes me so happy!
$C: Awesome.  To bad that food is 90% cardboard. :/
$C: Nice mcDonald ad.
$C: I install graphics in various businesses on a regular basis. Use the clipboard method and act like you know what you are busy and know where to go even if employees or management don't know  anything about it. Just someone the graphics were scheduled to go up there and boom your in. 
$C: Yep. 🎵Tataratataaa~I'm Lovin' It! 🍟🍔 Lmaooo
$C: Looks to be in Pearland Texas. Some pics from Google maps. https://imgur.com/a/Ydk92F2
$C: Why would you advertise for a billion dollar company... for fun? Not even put a joke or anything creative in there? Taking time and materials out of pocket? For fun?

Doesn't add up. They're either lying or I've got a fence for them to paint.
$C: Seriously? No district manager saw it and went: "Hold the phone!!!!???... What!!?"
$C: They probably noticed and just left it because it looked legit enough.
$C: I’m loving it!
$C: That’s brilliant! 
$C: I think they missed a real opportunity here. They could have been eating Burger King and the little slogan being have it your way. Or something like that. 
$C: Since the goal was to add Asian representation, this was Brill.   Hope they never take it down, too.
$C: How is that a fake poster? 
$C: This is the most upvotes I’ve ever seen. 
$C: I want McDonald’s now 
$C: Awesome, I would hire both of you. 10/10
$C: I don't know why that's cool, but it is.
$C: It looks like a real poster to me
$C: The. Best. Cheers!
$C: Hello everyone who got the trending notification!!
$C: Epic!!
$C: That's hilarious!!!
$C: Seems like anyone can make photostock pictures with a good camera
$C: I love this so much
$C: That McDonald's lucked out. Those posters aren't cheap and these guys donated one to them.

If I owned the place I would be happy about it.
$C: You gon be famous!!!!
$C: I’m Lovin’ it!
$C: Pioneers these two. 
$C: Epic. You guys win.
$C: i'm lovin' it
$C: My dude has now became Regional Interior Coordinator of Mcdonalds! 
$C: Jokes on them tho. Free advertisement for mc d. :P
$C: I’m lovin’ it.
$C: They’ll be on Ellen soon
$C: Paging r/actlikeyoubelong
$C: I remember someone doing something similar back in the day with a McDonalds sign that you would see while leaving the drive thru. I think it was on phonelosers.com. Rays tech support and gerbil grooming is still the funniest damn way to answer a call 
$C: r/actlikeyoubelong
$C: Lmao 
$C: it beautiful
$C: I could look it up, but I think Goethe said, "There's a kind of genius in boldness."

You magnificent bastards!  Respect.
$C: Hi I work for McDonald's corporate and I would like to discuss working with our advertising team, PM for details. Thank you. 
$C: A tiny bit r/actlikeyoubelong, eh?
$C: This is trolltastic
$C: /r/madlads gold 
$C: r/actlikeyoubelong
$C: Boss move.
$C: That's awesome
$C: This is quality lol
$C: Why is that "fake poster" ? Isn't that actually on the wall? 
$C: For next challenge:  


* **BE** a McDonald's employee.
$C: Stealth 100/100
$C: It's slightly funny, but there's nothing that makes it remarkable.
$C: Will McDonald's ever get a vegan burger already? 
$C: There’s no way one of the managers hasn’t noticed. It’s just a matter of lack of communication and care I feel like. 
$C: Guys, that’s awesome
$C: Hey! This is me, AMA.
$C: Proud of them
$C: A guy I know did something similar:

$C: It’s free real estate 😏
$C: This is amazing lol 
$C: Absolutely legendary. Having worked there before, i would welcome any new art.
$C: This is a hilarious prank! They should get free McDonalds stuff or at least a job offer from corporate marketing.
$C: I wonder if this will become a thing.
$C: r/madlads
$C: That poster is awful.
$C: r/madlads
$C: This needs to make top post of all time
$C: r/madlads
$C: What a classic hahahah
$C: r/madlads
$C: Native reddit ad
$C: Only difference is the McDonald's ad would've been white people instead

$C: Epitome of reddit. Tons of karma for shit that's irrelevant to life. 
$C: Ducking great
$C: This is amazing. More of us need to do this.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Harold and Kumar go to mcdonalds
$C: We did something similar when I was younger. I had asked for no pickles on my burger, but they messed my order up again. Threw the pickles on the wall. They were there for longer than 6 months.
$C: Nice
$C: Hire those guys to a graphic design department. That looks like a legitimate McDonald's ad.
$C: What's fake about the poster? Looks real to me.
$C: r/madlads

$C: Cool in a Harold and Kumar kinda way
$C: One of them should've had a joint behind their ear.
$C: Nah, I'm good, Mickey D's. Good attempt though.
$C: Thank you McDonald's viral marketing.

EDIT: Being downvoted by McDonald's viral marketing. :P
$C: After paying for that HQ printing, all they could afford was a medium fry and a strawberry smoothie.
$C: I love how even management hasn't noticed. That's some excellent poster design. 

I'm also just commenting in case this becomes the top post of all time. Hello historians!
$C: Look like an Asian Key and Peele 
$C: These motherfuckers eat at McDonald’s. 
$C: r/madlads
$C: Absolute legends. 
$C: Now this is Fucking awesome.
$C: will not be long before they find which mcdonalds has this installed and take it down. they should have not said anything and made it to the 5 year mark then post it. but oh well
$C: Did they have to drill into the wall to mount the picture? That would have been noisy, so I wonder how they did it without drawing attention to themselves, especially from management on duty.
$C: This is way too funny!
$C: You win the internet today
$C: It would be considered racist and homophobic if McDonald's took it down.
$C: I'm lovin' it
$C: r/madlads
$C: Heroes.
$C: Not every day you see a pic of not one, but two heros.
$C: I love his “adulting” shirt. They’re doing it right.
$C: McDonald's needs to hire these guys
$C: The funniest part is that they kept a McDonalds wrapper, or perhaps even just used wax paper so that they could make their own burger to showcase, since McDonald's burgers don't look remotely like that.
  
I wouldn't be surprised if they went to one of the "somewhat" fast food places to pick up a real burger then put it in the wrapper lol.  
$C: Harold and Kumar ?
$C: OMG please come talk on my blog and earn money the log in is the last link hope to see u guys McDonald's maybe on the moon www.arisingempowermentchurch.com
$C: But MackDonald's is American, we can't have the Asiatic foreigners shilling for them
$C: A free ad for a billion dollar company. I still think its awesome, pay these dudes!
$C: Hello front page
$C: Awesome. I upvoted everyone here 
$C: It's not actually broken. Workers just don't want to have to clean it at the end of their shift.  

Edit: And/or haven't been trained to clean it.  
Edit2: I may be perpetuating a myth. [See article.](https://www.rd.com/food/fun/mcdonalds-ice-cream-machines/)  
Edit3: RIP my inbox. Okay, everyone. I'm getting a bunch of people saying it's true and others saying it's not because the machines self-clean. Apparently self-cleaning with older machines can take up to 4 hours. So I guess there's some truth to it. Go to dairy queen if you want your fast food ice cream fix I guess.
$C: So lemme give some insight here. So I work at a convenience store that uses the same ice cream machines as McDonald's. One day i was talking to the guy who was cleaning it and he said why. Ours are cleaned every 30 days by Taylor the manufacturer. We only clean the nozzle and exterior and replace the dairy base. 

McDonald's has to clean theirs every night. Like take everything out of it and clean it. Sometimes they clean it and don't want to have to reclean it if someone orders something. So it's "broken"
$C: I've never once seen a McDonald's with a broken ice cream machine. Do I get a medal or something?
$C: You need some *Ocean's Eleven* type of planning and execution for that to work.
$C: Just left McDonalds. Ice cream machine worked fine. Apparently the hot fudge container was too cool and nothing would pump out. It’s always something....
$C: Ordered a medium drink last week. They didn’t have any lids that fit, so they stuck a coffee cup lid on top. Just felt like complaining about my first world problems. 
$C: TIL tau = 2π
$C: Lol, most of the time it's only broken late at night after it's already been cleaned 'cause FUCK cleaning that thing for a 2nd time in a shift. At least when it's cleaned properly... the ones that never have a broken ice cream machine... be wary.
$C: I work at a McDonald's in the Midwest and while I KNOW half of my crew doesn't clean the machine when they're supposed to, I can tell you this much - I can make two cones, maybe three, before the hopper starts pulling in more air than soft serve mix. We're not dairy Queen and it always frustrates me to get 5 orders back to back with 4 mcflurries and 5 cones because it will take at least 5 minutes each time the machine stops before I can serve any more. Shakes? All day, no problem. Soft serve? The devil, I say!
$C: I don't understand why this is always a joke in mcdonalds threads when it is actually not that common of a problem... is this one of those things where someone sees a joke on reddit so they just all repeat it, despite it making no sense?
$C: I was always under the impression that Tau = F*r, but whatever floats your boat. (Yes, I am aware of the usage of tau as 2pi for math to make things like radians make sense.)
$C: THANK YOU
$C: How many McD app users out there order and pay for something only to have an employee walk out to the car and say "We don't have <item-I-just-bought>." Preventing that is my #1 request.
$C: Or actually have chocolate ice cream.
$C: Hey dad, didn't know you had a reddit account
$C: I stopped caring about the McDonalds ice cream when they stopped having chocolate soft serve. 
$C: I stopped ordering those items years ago because I have issues respecting a menu (and the accompanying restaurant) where some items that you want to order are routinely not available despite being on the menu. So, to me it's like they just don't even serve ice cream.
$C: HILARIOUS 
$C: That’s very weird. In Portugal I haven’t had a single McDonalds deny me ice cream for any reason whatsoever. :O
$C: intellectuals. well played
$C: I hate it when you are the first customer after they clean the machine and you get that little taste of cleaning solution in your shake.
$C: So guys is there anyway to prove it's not broken if you really craving a mc flurry?
$C: I lived by a Dairy Queen that always had their ice cream machine broken wtf
$C: I have never once in my life been denied ice cream at McDonalds. 
$C: Or maybe wipe off the tables once a week so I have a clean place to eat without wearing pop, salt and french fries on my arms. BTW, that's why I don't pick up my tray after eating. It forces them to venture out from behind the counter and maybe, just maybe, wipe off the table.
$C: Until recently, I didn't know this was a frequent thing, honestly. I've worked at McDonald's twice, and even when I worked there, I don't remember it ever happening. I think this is just a thing people say and just agree with because it sounds plausible, not because it's something that happens on a regular basis. 
$C: I’ve been a McD’s Manager for several years now at many different stores in my area and I’m convinced that the manufacturer of the machines purposefully make them crappily and they’re the only company that provides service and replacement parts. There are times when crew is being lazy and faking a broken machine, but when the damn thing does go out, it’s usually because of bad parts or a tech who doesn’t know what s/he is doing and just makes it worse. 
$C: OMG gooooold
$C: Me: Yeah, could I get a soft served cone plz?

Them: Uh, one second.

Them 2: Oh, sorry sir, the machine is broken right now.
$C: Found the asshole that orders the ice cream 10 minutes before closing time.
$C: There is nothing in McDonald's that deserves to be called ice cream. 
$C: BOOM!
$C: I drove up to McDonalds on my lunch break during a massive storm, since it was right down the street from my hotel. I was ordering a chocolate shake when massive lightning split the air and the drive-thru menu died right infront of me. Twenty seconds later they get the microphone back on and tell me the ice cream machine was down.

It's cosmic.
$C: Please add a bilzzad machine too. Thx.
$C: And stop the all milkshakes from banana except banana which doesn’t taste of anything but milk
$C: Do you ice cream machine work?

Barely!

Well, McClean it, and get me some ice cream!
$C: It’s really not broken. It goes into a heat cycle at a certain time to clean and takes about 4 hours...I worked there for 7 years 
$C: Or their god damn frappe machine aka a fucking blender. 
$C: How 'bout just put real ice cream in there instead of vegetable oil. 
$C: lmao our Mc'Donalds is broken too!!
$C: I have never once been to a McDonalds in Canada where the ice cream machine doesn’t work. What u guys doing in America lol
$C: Beating a dead horse as always. Good job Reddit.  The ice cream machines aren't usually actually broken. From what I've read, the machines have an automated, intensive hot self-cleaning mode that takes a good half hour or so. Necessary because of the dairy products involved and the risks they can cause. 
So when you ask for an ice cream, would you rather the employee tell you that the machine is cleaning the old spoiled ice cream out of itself? Or just that "it's down" ?

Correct me anyone that has more experience with the machines, this is just the overview of what I've seen on comments like this
$C: They are mere mortals. You expect too much of them.  Can they impress you with plastic straws?
$C: You don't wanna eat that ice cream. Trust me

You can down vote me all you want but the insides of those machines are disgusting! 
$C: To clear up all this he said she said stuff going on in the comments about McDonald's apparent vendetta to lie and not make people ice cream... I have a good college friend who worked at McD's for a good long while, about 4-5 years. They don't just tell you some nonsense because of laziness and not make you ice cream. She told me a few times someone tried this and once the store or general manager finds out people are doing this they fire them on the spot. McD's is a business like all else and they want money. Not making an order because of laziness is not something any business highly promotes within and usually leads to termination on the spot.

&#x200B;

so TLDR; if someone at McD's says the ice cream machine is broken it's probably broken, or clogged, etc. basically they really CAN'T make you your ice cream, get over it.
$C: It looks like one, but it's an imposter.
$C: I'm pretty sure the title should read "McDonalds marketing execs cleverly dupe redditors into pushing their ads to the front page by pretending that these two young, handsome, and ethnically ambiguous models secretly hung professional caliber photos of themselves promoting McDonalds products on random, unused spaces."

Edit: Zero-proofreading typos fixed.
$C: Real fake poster!
$C: It amazes me how frequently random McDonalds-related stuff makes it to the front page...
$C: But for real, are we sure they’re not the actual models that became lovers during the shoot and wanted to take a pic in front of their first meeting? 
$C: Reddit... where someone already thought of my pithy comment before me
$C: That‘s what those damn mimics want you to think...
$C: It's believable until you check out that burger. Really well made/prepared makes me suspicious.
$C: Heard these guys found a Google Pixel 3 XL behind the poster
$C: I think its actually genius marketing. Look at the circles, the random black ones are, well, randomly placed, but the yellow one sticks out. Which just so happens to be around a large fry. Right next to the McDonalds symbol. It catches your eye, and admittedly it made me crave a large fry.
$C: Nope just a couple of posers.
$C: Poser poster
$C: It is actually a poser
$C: That’s not those guys! That’s a **picture** of those guys!

The icons!

The franchise!
$C: r/madlads
$C: Are you a fake poster?
$C: It actually *is* a poster, that they made.
$C: Nope! Chuck Testa!
$C: Yeah, guerilla marketing by Uncle Don's
$C: If you zoom in you would realize they either took out of this world care when making the Photoshop or it's real. Pay attention to the shadow on the left and all the light pollution behind the light.
$C: Not only that, it looks like it has some depth to it, like a thin canvas.
$C: Me too
$C: 😁😂🤣
$C: What a smart and forward thinking manager. Why spend money to hire computer people to make the posters when customers can do it completely themselves 
$C: And it works on so many levels. For one, they're fit, which would give the viewer the impression that McDonald's is good for you. They're of two different somewhat ambiguous races, which should appeal to everyone, indicating that McDonald's promotes diversity and is welcoming to people from everywhere. Also, two individuals who have different likes (in this case, a hamburger-lover, and a french fry fiend) can get along and have a thoughtful and humorous conversation about, say, a royale with cheese. They're possibly on campus, and therefore collegiate, which means they're smart, so if you eat McDonald's you must be smart as well. These Mad Men are going places.
$C: Lol they tricked McDonald's into letting them do expensive advertising work for them for free. Gottem!
$C: Yeah. Seems like McDonald's is getting the last laugh on this one.

​

^(Or this is all an elaborately-planned McDonald's marketing campaign.)

​

Edit: I think it's reasonable to be skeptical of stuff like this on Reddit, but someone else posted a [video of the making of this prank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rJHC6nY4F8&feature=youtu.be). So it seems to be legitimate and not orchestrated by McDonald's.

​

^(Or McDonald's is getting really sophisticated with it's guerilla marketing campaigns and the video itself is part of the campaign... j/k)
$C: It would be pretty expensive to have that printed just for fun....
$C: It probably is. I wouldn’t be surprised if this whole reddit post is an ad...
$C: Are you speaking about the poster or this reddit post?
$C: You're talking about this entire post in general right? Because this is all a McDonalds ad, and you're participating in it right now.
$C: It could be because of the McDonalds logo and slogan in the corner. 
$C: This whole post? Yes, I agree. 
$C: Thats because this IS an advertisement.
$C: That's because it is.  Along with the McDonald's make up from yesterday. 

It's very clever tough
$C: Man, I wish so much that they had been holding a Burger King burger and fries.  Subtle yet hilarious.
That’s the real test.  See how long that stays up.
$C: Uh yes it is professionally made, because this is BS gorilla marketing to idiot millennials 
$C: That, or a Mass Comm student project in advertising media. "Make something impactful and you pass."

"Hold my beer, prof. I'll make an unauthorized McD-grade ad, install it without letting them notice, and also make it viral."
$C: The definition of "fake it til you make it"
$C: It looks that way because of the way it is.
$C: This would be like me as a handy man, going around fixing broken things all over the place and rubbing my hands together thinking about my mischievous repairing spree. 
$C: 10 thousand upvotes for that simple comment.
*JUMPS ONTO BANDWAGON*

I agree. The circles representing happiness and that easygoing side of McDonalds does imitate a real ad.
$C: Drop shadow on a logo? Absolutely not!
$C: Are you talking about this post or the picture on the wall?
$C: Because it is.
$C: That is because it is in fact a professionally made McDonald's ad.

Does this really strike you as being the quality of post to warrant the number of upvotes, gilding, and position in /r/All it has received? 

No, because McD's can just pay Reddit to get a "subtle" ad boosted as organic social media content. They haven't gotten much better at it since the low-effort VR + big mac + wine post a while back.
$C: It's clearly "on brand" so they may as well leave it up.
$C: Because it was.  Duh.
$C: So does the post.
$C: The burger is too small for a real McDonald's ad.
$C: This Reddit post is a McDonalds ad.
$C: Cause it is 🤷🏼‍♂️
$C: Probably because it is.. yay product placement. McDonalds is sketch and is cancer food. Why does anyone eat there anymore?
$C: Probably because it is.
$C: I mean it kind of is. High production quality and it's advertising McDonald's on reddit.
$C: much like this post...
$C: It looks better than the other posters there.
$C: As does this post.

&#x200B;
$C: all of this is
$C: And now McDonalds is on the front page again. Works!
$C: The only unprofessional aspect that I can see is that they are covering the McDonald's logos on the burger and fries. Ads almost always have the models positioned in a way where the full product including branding is clearly visible.
$C: McDonald's wouldn't use a drop shadow on the logo, but otherwise yeah.
$C: hello again with your random top comment in a top thread, see you in like 5 minutes in another top thread with a top comment, as usual :)
$C: No. It doesn't.
$C: Because it is one.
$C: Jollibee is still number 1. Subtle shade at the end of their video.
$C: > It does look like a professionally made McDonald's ad.

It is a professionally made McDonald's ad.
$C: And McDonald's have done astroturfing adverts before.
$C: That's because it is and this is a social media advert posted by a professional karmawhore. 
$C: it is
$C: This post is probably a mcdonalds ad. 
$C: because it is
$C: That's cause it is 
$C: Hijacking the top comment to post the [source](https://youtu.be/0rJHC6nY4F8)
$C: It very well might be. Who is to say that this Reddit post isn't entirely fabricated by McDonald's marketing?
$C: This whole post *is* a professionally made McDonald's ad.
$C: That's because it was, it's a viral marketing campaign. 
$C: probably because it IS a professionally made McDonald's ad.

McDonald's likes to do these adverts that don't seem like adverts ("check out this weird/quirky thing related to my Favorite Fastfood Chain!") and have had a lot of success with it on this subreddit.
$C: Yeah if this is handled by someone smart they will leave it up, and appreciate the free social media attention.
$C: I love the random circles, they say "i was a graphic design major so fuck it this is a trendy thing so im gonna do it too".
$C: technically they are professional mcdonalds people
$C: they should get some type of money off it 👍🏾
$C: Would have been better if they were holding BK.
$C: Um, what if this IS the McDonald’s ad meant to look like it’s sort of not. Seems the way most of these things are happening nowadays
$C: I'd say this post is the actual advert
$C: If they get that ridiculous menu song that was sung by the micro machine man covered, they have my full support.

Advertising lobbying. I'm sure someone has pinged McDonald's by now.

If not, i guarantee this will be figured out within 90 days when whoever does their merchandising sees it. It's easy to not pay attention until seasonal signage change.
$C: That’s because it probably is
$C: "Its now been 51 days since they hang it up" 
Nice try McDonald's. 
$C: Well yeah, that's kind of the whole point.
$C: That's probably because it is.
$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rJHC6nY4F8

Video of how he did this.
$C: Got the minorities and everything lol
$C: Maybe the reddit post is the  ad
$C: No, it doesn’t. 
$C: Minorities: Check

Product Placement: Check

Woman: No check. 


$C: Just like this post lol, such an obvious ad
$C: That's because it is, you know it's just the ad is meant for reddit, cause kids like that viral thing these days 
$C: Right they're actors! It's NOT fake!
$C: An acquaintance of mine did this.

http://cockeyed.com/pranks/mall/plazaprank.html


That mall no longer exists though, rather it has been very remodeled.
$C: Has McDonalds replied yet? 
$C: True trolling at it's finest. Let's see how many days the poster lasts till management takes it down.
$C: Bloody good looking young people, make me sick
$C: Nope, it’s a Tide ad
$C: [removed]
$C: These dudes don't actually get anything out of this lol

They just shot, edited, and printed an ad for McDonalds for free, and now posted it to Reddit for 700 upvotes for them too


$C: /r/BigMactLikeYouBelong
$C: /r/madlads
$C: /r/CommentASubreddit
$C: It was already posted there by the guys in the photo, op stole it and posted here
$C: #adulting
$C: Legends
$C: Of course this is a real sub
$C: They should have taken identical pics with McDonald's and Burger King products.  Put the McDonald's poster up first and leave it for a few weeks, so the employees quit really "seeing" it because it's just part of the background to them now.  Then swap it for the Burger King poster. 
$C: Oh fuck that would have been great.
$C: While sporting the McDowell's logo from Coming to America.
$C: That's how you get it taken down, and then the joke is dead.
$C: Master level trolling
$C: They should come in once a month with a different poster. Have the manager or someone sign something to make it look official. Once them showing up is the norm, start working in other things. "We are partnering with BK this month, the one down the street has a McFlurry poster this month"
$C: McDevious
$C: That would be funny, but the whole point is that nobody notices it's not a real ad. It's supposed to blend in perfectly.
$C: I'm trying to imagine how this sentence would had been better.
$C: Would had?

$C: Hell yes man
$C: won't be an ad for mcdonalds then
$C: While really funny, it would have had a negative side effect of getting people fired. If an exec had come in and seen it, then the store manager would probably been fired on the spot. This looks like a legit add and has the potential of being unnoticed for years. 
$C: but then it wouldn’t be a mcdeath ad posing as a reddit post. 
$C: Agree to disagree.
$C: We did this in a local bar. They would frame signed headshots of celebrities, so we framed a picture of our drinking group, signed it, then hung it in an empty spot. It stayed there for 10 years or more. The bar eventually closed, hopefully not because our ugly mugs drove people away :(
$C: This really needs to be higher. The video answers a lot of questions in these comments.

Edit: Ok, it's the 'best' comment now, I get it. We did it Reddit!
$C: Haha nice. My friend did something similar at Groupon. He did work there, though, but in customer support.

He and a buddy made a fake Groupon ad as a joke to cope with how soul crushing it was to work in corporate America instead making movies like they wanted to. They went skydiving in Groupon gear or something and edited into a commercial.Their bosses saw the video and gave them jobs making videos and commercials for Groupon. Their old department eventually got outsourced to call centers in Asia, and it was the bump they both needed to get into the film industry.

I can't find the video on YouTube, but the story is definitely true because

EDIT: because... he still works for Groupon producing videos and his best man told the story at their wedding.
$C: > This is not a marketing campaign.

It is now.
$C: Oh did a redditor not credit the original content creator? I am flabbergasted. 
$C: Props to those guys, it looks really good. Send them props from a random online :P
$C: It fits in with the other posters, and they did them a favor filling that blank wall, so hopefully they keep it up
$C: So this post isn't an ad for McDonald's but rather an ad for this guy's YouTube channel!
$C: This is pretty awesome:)
$C: Okay, this is amazing. I was curious as to how they physically got the poster inside the restaurant. Never thought it would be that easy. My favorite part is Jevh (love his name btw) going thrift shopping for a McDonald's t-shirt! And all of this because he wanted to show some Asian representation; what a great motive! Seem like awesome dudes. Hope it stays up!
$C: You're friend is amazing, this is one of the greatest pranks I've ever seen.
$C: I don't know if this has been asked already in this big ass thread but Office Depot didn't give them any grief for ordering a print with the McDonalds logo on it? I thought they wouldn't print any copyrighted material?
$C: lmao, i like the token racial diversity thesis to this. good way to stop mcdonald's from taking any action.
$C: So can we have an update what happens when this video gets seen by the news and corporate McDonald's? I'm not being facetious, I genuinely would like to know how this will end up.
$C: Not a marketing campaign yet gilded and on r/all?...

Sorry OP but if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck it doesn't mater how much they paid you to say it's a dog, I don't believe you.
$C: a better prank would be the same idea but a subversive message or hidden image
$C: [deleted]
$C: It's a lot like the guy who put up [his own sign](https://www.good.is/articles/the-fake-freeway-sign-that-became-a-real-public-service) on a California freeway.
$C: Tell your friend he's kinda cute! 
$C: With the girlfriend complaining about people cleaning in a restaurant and then him opening with the lack of Asians as to why they put it up I just could not watch that shit without laughing 
$C: OP is a professional redditor who gets paid to post this kind of shit.
$C: Tell him to quit it with the lens flare.
$C: Absolute legend
$C: What a wholesome prank. Seems like the uniform was unnecessary though lol.
$C: You should have posted it.  OP stole your karma. 
$C: I have some friends at McDonald’s corporate and they enjoyed this.
$C: Your friends sound like hilariously good guys, stick with them!
$C: City?
$C: Sounds like a cool guy who just does it, should go far 
$C: Hey Reddit, let’s make him famous. 
$C: I love this and his reasoning so much! This is just purely awesome. Tell your friend he is fucking badass and awesome AF and I’m so proud of him!
$C: yeah still not going to believe it given how well the people are blurred out within the first 10 seconds of the video

$C: Is it a “prank”?  It isn’t funny, it doesn’t prank anyone, in fact it seems to help McDonalds, one of the largest corporations in the world who systematically poison people for great profit.  So subversive and funny. 
$C: >Edit: No, they were not hired by McDonald’s for this.

Wait a second. Are they employed by McDonald's at all? Or are they just customers who came in and hung up a poster?
$C: So did the restaurant owner or McDonald’s respond?
$C: >If you knew him, this is completely in vein of everything he does in life. Right down to the extreme attention to detail 

I would agree if not for that lower case i.
$C: When McDonald’s started being open 24 hrs, my buddy showed up at a McDonald’s with his work truck, loaded all of the leather/pleather chairs into the truck (like 6), during which a staff member came up and asked what he was doing. He said he was coming back with new chairs from the warehouse after he brought those ones away. He took the chairs in the truck, went through the drive through, and got a meal, went to the beach nearby, took one chair and sat in the chair and ate his food. Then, he loaded the chair back into the truck, drove them back to that same McDonald’s, and started unloading the chairs. About an hour had passed, and now that McDonald’s thinks they got a whole new set of chairs, one with a little bit of sand.
$C: Filipinos, right?
$C: Funny and smart prank. 

But holy shit, shut up about race.

Seriously, hanging up a picture in McDonalds changes NOTHING and it certainly doesnt equate to "representation in media" and the entire comment comes across cringey and insincere. Not to mention how unnecessary it is.
$C: Everyone is in denial if they think McDonald's doesn't know about this (and has for weeks), and is now actively trying to fan the flame. 
$C: Hey /r/nothingeverhappens people, he mentioned 3m command strips! It must be an ad for McDonald's AND 3m! Get him!
$C: Hmmm 3 year club, has plenty of comments, verified email. This guy checks out for now.
$C: Does this dude live in Orlando florida?
$C: That was awesome! 
$C: The management for sure noticed, but must’ve liked it enough to keep it! 
$C: This is awesome. Thanks for sharing.
$C: Beautiful! 
$C: Best thing I've ever seen. 4 minutes well spent
$C: I don’t know whether this would look good or bad on his resume. 
$C: this goes deep... you’re fake too. mcdonald’s paid you all off 

/s 
$C: I like the jollibee part.
$C: Go Coogs!
$C: Seems like a pretty good, fun dude
$C: They made a professional quality youtube video saying "lol it's not a fake" with even more shenanigans and pictures of them dressed up McDonalds uniforms with even more shots of the McDonalds logos and McDonalds restuarants and McDonalds products???

Well that settles it, this has nothing to do with McDonalds corporate, there's no way they could be sophisticated enough to make both a reddit post and a youtube video ready to go countering claims of corporate advertising the same day it was posted.

Oh and a twitter post, gee that really seals the deal, no way McDonalds marketing could figure that one out.
$C: Why would McDonald's care? They should have been eating Burger King or a different competitor and it would have been way more funny. They literally took the time and money to hang up an advertisement. 
$C: Tell your dudes they a couple of OGs for this haha
$C: This design is a copy of the other images in the McDonald's. I think him putting a fake badge on and McDonald's shirt was a bad idea, making it a potentially illegal situation in regards to impersonation laws. 
$C: ads on reddit :/
$C: I love how every marketing campaign on Reddit now comes with one of these posts belittling people for thinking it's a marketing campaign *because they were there*.
$C: This is a perfect example of a fantastic prank.  Hats offf to your friend for real.
$C: It would cost hundreds of dollars to print that. I don't believe it.
$C: If it were fall off that wall and knock hot coffee in someone's lap....

McDonald's has the name of the people who hung to picture and a video of them doing it.
$C: Liability 
$C: Hamburguerilla marketing 
$C: "What if.....stay with me now, what if we got *them* to advertise to *themselves*??"

...

*room erupts in bonuses and applause*
$C: Sorry, The machine's broken
$C: I'm suddenly craving a *Big Mac^^®* with an asian man.
$C: Quite the frankly I’m sick of not being able to enjoy Reddit without corporations throwing ads in my face.. but you know what always cheers me up? Some golden, perfectly salted fries from my friendly, neighborhood McDonald’s.
$C: “Ads have taken the next step in their evolution, they have taken human form... ads are among us! They could be your friend... your gardener... your latest Reddit post!” 
$C: Obviously that's the popular opinion here, and probably the case. But, field a dumb question for the uninitiated? OP's account is four years old and seems to be an active Reddit user. So it's clearly not JUST a shill account. Does McDonald's pay him to post this on his account? Does he work for them anyways? I'm not trying to mythbust or disprove anything here, I'm just curious how this works.
$C: Yup! McDonald's did AstroTurf marketing like this last year.  Someone's McDonald's delivery driver stuck around to try out their VR rig.  [Everything was placed juuuust right.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/6ql2tu/made_my_delivery_drivers_night_by_showing_him_vr)
$C: Yes, and it started with a viral Twitter post. Next stop, Facebook.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Now I want some McDonald’s...

Damn you’re good.
$C: Mcgangbang
$C: Sorry our ice cream machine is broken...
$C: seriously though, bout to go buy some fries
$C: How would they hang it up with no one noticing or caring?
$C: I'm going to think this over with my fists: McTrouble and McFury
$C: [deleted]
$C: r/fellowkids
$C: Don’t forget about the new Strawberry and Crème Pie™️ at select locations.
$C: I think stuff over better with mcdonalds French Fries. It makes it easy for me to mark my calender for the McRIB next month on OCTOBER.
$C: I saw this post earlier today then got McDonalds for lunch without thinking about it...mission accomplished? 
$C: I was going to say that too but if McDonalds was involved, the guy on the left would be holding a better looking burger. Like the ones they have on their tv commercials
$C: No ice cream tho. Typical...
$C: BRB, standing under that sign and ripping it off the wall and then saying it fell on me and suing McD's.
$C: The ads have taken over. They're everywhere!
$C: Honestly this combined with these McDonald’s coupons I have at home.. 

Tonight’s going to be a McDonald’s night 
$C: I find it annoying how many posts get linked to r/hailcorperate, but this screams r/hailcorperate to me
$C: McFlurry machine broke 
$C: It’s actually A tide ad. Look at their clean clothes! 
$C: Bingo!
$C: Totally agree! This must be an actual ad for Mcdonald’s, and we’re helping them lol
$C: Do you want fries with that?
$C: Or perhaps you're part of the ad as well. Ad-ception.
$C: I don't think so I'm this case because the whole motivation, according to his YouTube video, was the lack of any Asians in the other posters. I don't think even the most subtle /r/hailcorporate ad would leverage the company's own lack of diversity.
$C: Probably. How could they put that on so perfectly without being stopped by an employee? That’s not something you just do in 5 seconds.
$C: Just make sure to check the McDonalds^^TM app to catch the great deals of the day on all your favorites!
$C: Macception 
$C: HAha! Nice try, Bruger King marketing!
$C: I am loving it. 
$C: Make sure to get the new apple pie McFlurry™ for more ad McRevenue™. 
$C: It's originally a Twitter post and the dude's profile is clearly not a corporate façade. Old account and plenty of selfies and other non-mcdonalds related material.
$C: Don’t forget to use the McDonald’s app, now available for iPhone, Android, and those disgusting Windows Phone users.
$C: it goes deeper than we thought 
$C: I’m going to BK
$C: Sorry the machine is broken
$C: I'm literally debating going to McDonald's right now.

Edit: Just got back from McDonalds, advertising worked on me.
$C: #ad
$C: It isn't even sneaky, it's the most blatant ad yet.
$C: They can't keep getting away with this!
$C: You forgot these ™™
$C: No guys this is not a McDonald’s™ ad
$C: It's actually a Tide ad. 

Note the remarkably clean clothing.
$C: Their marketing department isn't this clever
$C: i think its more an example of over worked low paid employees not noticing, caring or even bothering to do anything. 
$C: Or it's an example of these two doing guerrilla marketing for McDonalds, actually being employed by the company for doing this, but saying they just did it  for fun.

Hey I could be wrong, but lets not forget that as a possibility.
$C: The HR department at my company puts up motivational posters all over the place. The only ones I have read are the ones in the bathroom...
$C: Flashbacks to my previous job. I've got tons of graphic design experience, but they just needed an admin. Fair enough, took the job, but I also offered to design their event banners (based on the fact that the previous ones have very large, horrible jpeg artifacts all over them).  
  
They tell me that they can't, because the old guy they've got handling their print materials would be upset, and they didn't want to step on his toes. Have it your way then, keep churning out shit, can't let somebody competent take it over from old Pete.
$C: got a pic?
$C: The "digital media expert" at my small office is the boss's wife. She is not very good at it all. She also can't spell very well, and never gets stuff spell checked before putting it up on Facebook or whatever. It's so frustrating.

I do a bit of Photoshop stuff in my spare time, nothing too serious or advanced but I know my way around file types and how to make things look good etc, and I also know how to spell. A lot of stuff that goes out with our name on it just makes me cringe but if you ever mention something she's always got an excuse and the boss always backs it up. If they locked me in a room for a day a week and told no one else to bother me, I'd come up with stuff at least as good if not better than what she does.

More or less unrelated, but she's also one of those "I bought a DSLR so I'm a professional photographer" people. The staff photo she took of all of us is so washed out and poorly lighted that it looks like a bad phone photo.
$C: Those recent grads should get a job at McDonald’s then 

Wonder why they won’t
$C: Why would they? They are already doing it for free
$C: They already have a job, its called guerilla marketing for McDonalds. Actually its more like an unpaid internship.
$C: They did, this is the job.
$C: Doing what? Making posters for the interior is not exactly a 9-5 mon-fri consistent thing. These posters don’t come from local designers. They get designed by the HQ team and shipped out. 
$C: except they're using trademarked IP without permission
$C: No, they really shouldn’t give them jobs. It takes more than a mediocre Photoshopped image to land a marketing job at one of the biggest companies in the world. 
$C: 🤔
$C: I thought they were random floating crosshairs. Dudes about to be nuked. 

The grey circles are still floating around target-less - hence not highlighted. 
$C: No, the respawn point is on [Ronald's tray](https://youtu.be/EGkWFNLfKJM?t=41).
$C: Not unless McDonald's started offering free refills on fries. 
$C: Tenta Missle targets. 
$C: This, but without the implication they should give a shit. "Oh no, they'll cover whitespace with an attractive, professional looking ad for our own products if I don't stop them fast enough!" Ok.
$C: Yep. Money is right. Shake machine is clean. GT-O time.
$C: I bet once he sees this post on the news tomorrow, he still won't give a shit and keep it there like.. why would it matter at this point
$C: You laugh, but there's usually at least ONE of these people working in a restaurant
$C: Its also funny because my district manager at mcdonalds was named steve
$C: Someone posted earlier that they actually dressed up as a "Regional Interior Coordinator" and hung it up.

Edit: Here's a video of how they did it from another reddtior https://youtu.be/0rJHC6nY4F8
$C: I read it in Stewie's voice
$C: I couldn't tell you what shit we have up on the walls at work. Could be wall to wall Hitler quotes for all I know.
$C: Highly doubt that. Mcdees managers are always running around like headless chickens 
$C: It also matched the other posters in the restaurant. [Here's a link to the video](https://youtu.be/0rJHC6nY4F8)
$C: Literally
$C: I saw on twitter that one of the dudes dressed up as a fake "Regional Interior Coordinator":

$C: > drilling holes

Poster tape is pretty strong these days.
$C: He made a video on how they pulled it off:

https://youtu.be/0rJHC6nY4F8
$C: It’s just command tape!!!
$C: It could just be printed on a giant foam board and stuck to the wall with some 3M double sided sticky tape.  They could have been in and hung it up with in like 60 seconds.  
$C: They used adhesive, no holes required. 
$C: I'm baffled that you think this would be that difficult.
$C: Clearly no one would do such a thing unless they were supposed to.
$C: People making min wage DGAF
$C: I thought the used the two sided tape, not drilled holes. But not sure now why I thought that though. 
$C: They didn’t drill anything I just watched the video of how they did it 
$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rJHC6nY4F8&feature=youtu.be
$C: I was assuming it was paper glued to foam core mounted with double sided tape. 
$C: It’s a poster, and command strips
$C: Yeah and i'm suprised the command tape held that thing up for so long.
$C: I sure hope not. That would turn a fun prank into vandalism.
$C: You mean the people that paid for this reddit post? Probably?
$C: I don’t think she’s into guys.
$C: They did.
$C: I've heard she's a fucking bitch in real life.
$C: If I was a manager and saw someone had done that, I would think it was another manager or someone above me that did it.

And I definitely wouldn't ask about it, or else they might think I wasn't paying attention during a meeting.
$C: I don't think pranks "were meant to be" wholesome. 
$C: *Pics or it didn't happen*
$C: *Harold and Kumar Keep Milking It (2018).* 
$C: I laughed and groaned at the same time 
$C: They did.
$C: And,  just so happens to be labor day.  Huge day for business for fast food
$C: I just dont understand why people don't realize this, and this shit gets upvoted. Are people really that fucking stupid?
$C: Eh, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rJHC6nY4F8&feature=youtu.be) makes it seem more legit. If it is viral marketing, props to them for one helluva an elaborate scheme.
$C: Yep I'm officially craving fries 
$C: FOR THE FREEEEE! AND THE MODS ARE FINE WITH IT!
$C: Nice catch /u/pinkberrry!

On an unrelated note, do you know anywhere I can go to get some good frozen yogurt?
$C: Yup, don't often see something with +100k upvotes for something as stupid as this. Even if this wasn't a paid promo, this is surely a McD shill upvote swarm pushing it all up the front page. Just trying so fucking hard to be "organic".
$C: [Nope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rJHC6nY4F8)
$C: "This is clearly something that I have no evidence of it being."

&#x200B;

You annoy me.
$C: im weirdly craving mcdonalds right now
$C: Meh, I'm still lovin it 
$C: Except it’s not. 
$C: You are the worst kind of people.
$C: Most of the top comments are likely not real people. When they astroturf they make fake comments, fake posts, fake upvotes, fake downvotes to attack early negative commenters and following all that they basically break every rule of reddit. Followed by reddit doing nothing, which means reddit is likely getting kickbacks. Mcdonalds is having a massive campaign on reddit this is not the first ad I've seen in the last couple of days...
$C: ‘Obvious corporate content,’ right, it’s not like they released a video detailing how they snuck it in, or how some comments point out that it’s obviously not a corporate sign because the guy’s hand is covering the logo on the fries, or how the fries were photoshopped in. 
$C: I'm upvoting it just to piss you off.
$C: Tbh the guys at the table dont really look like the guys in the picture, imo.
$C: This is a popular tweet op stole from Twitter 
$C: Except it is real:

https://youtu.be/0rJHC6nY4F8


$C: Companies like McDinalds don't invest time and effort into doing things like this. 9 times out of 10 it's not coming from the company or an ad agency. 

Source: I work in marketing 
$C: I'm very sneaky sir
$C: I think it’s in Lakeland, Florida.
$C: McDonalds
$C: Yup it's one of those paid posts for sure. Monetizing reddit includes fake posts that are ads. Actually, that might be the only thing. Then you have a ton of sockpuppets that posts reddit-like comments so it looks like a normal popular post.

They also often monitor the comments that are like us and go after them.
$C: I'm honestly convinced that he makes up at least some of the stuff on his site. I used to read back in the day, but I just can't bring myself to believe the superbowl prank. I'm pretty sure he has kids, and I just can't see a parent risking jail time(or hell, getting shot! it took place post-9/11, and they were passing out electronic gizmos of indeterminate function at a major sporting event) on a dumb prank. I believe the prank is actually on the readers for that one, which casts a shadow of doubt over the entire site.
$C: I think those guys figured people think all Asians look alike. 
$C: Yeah, the 'chaos' is overwhelming. Just absolute madness. <rolls eyes>
$C: I’m not sure if you realise that Reddit isn’t mandatory. You don’t need to be here. 
$C: r/karmaconspiracy 
$C: Ah, there is no way to possibly edit a photo is there?
$C: [They did.](https://youtu.be/0rJHC6nY4F8)
$C: [deleted]
$C: Yup. Me too.
$C: Yet if you do the same thing on a website, you go to prison for a decade....
$C: They have one already.
$C: I doubt is free. Someone in marketing is getting a raise though. 
$C: "Gullible" is a trait many Redditors posses.
$C: The post is an advert, its a marketing ploy by mcdonalds.
$C: 13 year olds don't understand much unfortunately. This kind of thing is clever in their minds.

Edit: 13 year old Redditors triggered.
$C: Right, as though managers didn't see that and immediately notice it wasn't there the day before.
$C: It's not a prank. It's an ad 
$C: People making $7.25 an hour aren’t paid enough to care about things like that.  

In my experience, with the exception of a manager, the employees would probably find it funny.  
$C: They did a video on it. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rJHC6nY4F8&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rJHC6nY4F8&feature=youtu.be)
$C: it's upstairs, maybe
$C: Looks like they’re right by a door and we don’t see where the counter is, sometimes there’s no one standing at the front because they’re helping run food out, bag food, making ice cream etc. there’s a myriad of reasons someone could be not watching them. I don’t get stared down by MCD employees while I’m eating my food. Also if I brought in a poster while wearing a backpack and had my laptop they might think I’m working on a project and wanted to grab lunch at the same time. It’s not totally implausible. 
$C: What should catch on? People editing photos of themselves eating fast food, then paying to have life-size posters printed and hanging them for free in stores?


$C: Pretty sure McDonald’s is promoting this.
$C: > and McDonald's should promote it. 

It didn't get 40,000 upvotes in under an hour without a little promotional assistance
$C: They won’t.

$C: [$85 according to the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=72&v=0rJHC6nY4F8)
$C: Lol!!! It's true tho!!!
$C: Politics and business do NOT mix.
$C: Do you really have to ask? 
$C: Double sided tape. Quite quick actually. 
$C: McDonald’s aesthetics
$C: Graphic design
$C: It's fake 
$C: These dudes at least got paid 
$C: They did it for the lols
$C: You have spent money on things like that t-shirt with the band's name on it.  Advertising them for free.
$C: “Ad” for McDonald’s. It’s inside the fucking McDonald’s. If people are seeing it they’re already there. 
$C: >Not what I'd call smart.

Probably because you're a dumbfuck. It's an investment because they made a youtube video of it trying to grow their channel. The video is somewhat entertaining with quality editing. It cost them like $90 for the poster + mcdonalds shirt he bought to hang it. 
$C: The ad is inside the restaurant. People are literally inside already spending money. Not what I'd call the most effective advertising.
$C: Dude, think of the Reddit karma
$C: Oh, and a Large Fries, a Medium Fries, a Hamburger, and a small iced coffee.
$C: You are missing the point entirely. 
$C: Yeah I don't see why people are so impressed by this
$C: Internet karma is the best currency
$C: > "Mcdonalds ~~tricks~~ pays millennials ~~into creating their~~ for viral advertising material for them"

FTFY.


$C: Because there is a youtube video showing them creating the poster and hanging it in the McDonalds. 
$C: Why is this getting downvoted.
$C: Why do I find this sorting by contreversial? Like who the fuck downvotes this? Either people's gods are big corps or its mc do's bot army lmfao
$C: No because they had nothing to do with this ? 
$C: > Give these guys a job in the McD's marketing department. Totally works for me.

They have a job at McDonald's already.  You just looked at it.
$C: Trueer words have yet to be written
$C: But it’s not- you see, they faked the ad, and placed it up without anyone at McDonald’s even noticing! Genius!
$C: #**BECAUSE MODS AREN'T DOING THEIR JOB.**
$C: You shouldn't go to Mcdonalds then. 
$C: After McDonald's sues them for copyright infringement
$C: ...or did they?
$C: I typically eat a vegetarian diet, but food is food dude. Nothing wrong with a quick double and fries.
$C: Ah, Florida Man, NOW it's believable....
$C: Everything.

$C: They did. It's called guerilla marketing by McDonald's 
$C: Pro tip: use iirc for if I recall/remember correctly
$C: A local poster/tshirt/ad printing company, it must have cost a couple hundred to get printed. Easily doable. I have a flag of my band logo twice that size on a flag for a couple hundred. Make your own template in photoshop, they print it. You buy it.
$C: That's how you know it isn't a legit McDonald's poster 
$C: It's such a funny joke to put up a free poster for McD with their branding! Hahaha that showed them! Watch out if you have an empty wall in your business these guys are gonna sneak in a free decoration with your logo on it! 
$C: Who the fuck hangs up a poster with nails? You can get tack putty that works a hell of allot better and doesn't damage the walls.
$C: > I'd like to see someone walk an image that size through McDonald's and then proceed to hammer the necessary nails into the wall without anyone coming around to see what's going on. 

It's your lucky day then. Except the hammering part, they just use adhesive like normal people.

$C: Litany of woosh. I've been doing God's work down voting the wooshers 
$C: theres a video out there of them making it and it's genuine
$C: Or it was guerilla marketing all along 
$C: I read this as bah-da-da-da-da.
$C: Fresh off the boat from Nam
$C: Why are they idiots for doing something that they found to be fun?
$C: It really needs a hidden dickbutt or something.
$C: Really?
$C: Does it really count as advertising if it's IN the store in question?
$C: If BK had this idea for guerilla marketing they might've made the casting cut 
$C: They put it up as opposed to McDonald's, and did so without their permission.
$C: Or on other commercials because they're paid actors 
$C: Do you have a poster of yourself hanging up in a McDonalds somewhere?
$C: Just like you
$C: Did you have a stroke while you were typing that?

$C: hurr durr hail corporate I'm woke companies don't control me (posted from my samsung)
$C: They were...it's an ad 
$C: Wanna impress me?  Sneak into a McDonald's and ~~fix~~ clean the ice cream machine.
$C: Is it the same machine that makes milkshakes? Because I can never get a damn milkshake when I want one.
$C: Worked there. Spot on. 
$C: Those damn machines. I was a manager at a McDonald's and a BK when I was younger, both had ice cream machines made by a company called Taylor. They are serviced by a different, yet if I recall connected, company, Kappus. From my experience those machines can be a pain and do break down fairly often. They require A LOT of preventative maintenance and cleaning and if that isn't followed exactly problems crop up. Not to mention those machines need to stay cool..in a place where everything else produces a lot of heat so the compressor runs constantly which can lead to issues. That all said, when there is a maintenance issue it almost always requires a technician to come out to repair. The machines have very little user repairable parts, save for belts. If you are at a store, especially during the day, and you are told the machine is broken, odds are pretty good that they are being 100% truthful.

Here's another bit. The machines go into a 'heat mode' nightly that boils the milk mix in the resorvoir to keep the bacteria levels safe. This 'heat mode' was a frequent issue. If the machine had too much milk mix or too little in it that would effect the time it took to heat up or cool back down. If those times were off it threw the machine into an error. Once in that error the machine will not work until it goes through a successful heat cycle or it is taken apart and cleaned manually. A heat cycle takes a few hours. These are typically done at night when a store is close to closing or closed. So, if you are there at night and the machine has entered the 'heat mode' often employees will just say it is broken. If we tell someone it is cleaning they would often take it as we could serve you but are being too lazy, then they would lose their minds. Anyways, back to that 'heat mode' for a second. Say the machine fails a heat cycle and you try to put it back into 'heat mode' to get it up and running but it fails again for some reason. The machine can only fail those 'heat modes' a certain amount of times before the machine will force a manual cleaning. The thinking is that the milk mix in the resorvoir has been out of temperature too long, is unsafe, and must be discarded. Manual cleaning was a bit involved, but typically not crazy. There are a lot of parts that need disassembled and hand-washed, then you empty the mix resorvoirs, clean and sanitize everything, fill it up and then it's good to go in just a few minutes. Problem is, that cleaning process, while not difficult, takes about an hour. Often times if that cleaning was unplanned the store doesn't have an extra employee to handle it. At the stores I worked in this was always done by one of the managers as we were trained on how to maintain and clean the machines. So, you'll end up with a manager or employee already trying to do four or five jobs now trying to somehow figure out how to get this machine cleaned. Again, here we would generally just tell folks it was down for maintenance or broken. Something about telling people it needs cleaned would set them off, man. They took it like we were being lazy. Sorry, dude, I'm not trying to serve you a milkshake that might contain dangerous levels of bacteria, I know, fuck me, right? That said, the computer will not let the machine serve at this point anyways, it locks until it is hand cleaned. Then, this hand cleaning needs done periodically anyways, the schedule varies based on the machine, it's typically bi-weekly or monthly.

So, are there some asshole employees that just don't want to make a milkshake at night? Yep. They'll have the nightly cleaning done on the machine, they'll have it stocked for the next day, and then someone will come and order something from it and rather than make a mess of it they'll pull that BS and tell you it is broken. That's rare if you have a solid manager running the store. I'd say more often, at least in my experience, the issue really was maintenance (those machines were so damn finicky) or it was cleaning related and the store just does not have the staff at the time to handle whatever the damn machine is asking for.

Hope that gives you some insight into the mystery of ice cream machines at fast-food restaurants. Cheers.
$C: I've worked with a similar Taylor machine. They can be a pain sometimes. Occasionally toss a FREEZER LOCKED message, yay get to clean. Then cleaning daily as per the SSOP. Takes a bit to clean anyways. 
$C: Can confirm as an ex employee
$C: No myth man, I worked at Dairy Queen and at the end of the night every night we were “out of chocolate ice cream” when actually they were just cleaning it
$C: That's what I thought also, but the McDonald's I live near almost never has them, regardless of if I go there at about 1pm, 5pm, or 8pm even though they close at 1am.
$C: IDK I worked there for a minute, and that bitch broke all the time. It would also have trouble keeping up on busy, and or warm days.
$C: This is not a myth! Worked at McDonald's for nearly two years as a highschooler. I use to say the shake machine was broken all the time. Now it seems I can never get a milkshake. Karma amirite?
$C: What's this based on, because I guarantee you its fucking wrong. The machines are cheap garbage that are haphazardly fixed with shit parts that break down in week.

Source: was a manager during highschool
$C: Also, sometimes the workers are too lazy to go fetch a new bag of ice milk.
Source: worked at Mc a long time ago
$C: No ur kinda xorrect my cousin actually works at mc donalds and i asked nd she said more often then not its because the person didnt wanna clean it the night before nd it messes it up
$C: It does get cleaned, usually nightly by a manager. It just gets used so freaking much. 
$C: I read that when its cleaning it takes hours and they just say its broken so they don't have to deal with follow up questions if they say its being cleaned. 
$C: Solution: Get two McFlurry machines.
$C: Back when I was a late night delivery driver I got the GM's cell phone for my local McDonalds. He got very upset when I told him about the women who literally lies and says the place is closed at 4AM(they are 24 hours ago) because she is too lazy to make Sausage McGriddle for a guy who just spent 12 hours delivering pizzas to drunk idiots. I think she about started crying the one night she tried to pull this shit and I started reading off the GM's phone number and information threatening to call it in.

It would be the equivalent of me, as a driver, throwing someone's order out the window or something and lying and saying I couldn't find their house out of laziness. Shit just pisses me off, like she was literally scamming the owner of McDonald's by saying the store was closed when it was meant to be open.
$C: I used to work at mcdolnalds in my teens. When the ice cream machine was down it was usually because the person/s trained to clean/fix were not there. It a fragile machine with lots of moving parts which is prolly why it breaks a lot.
$C: And they want to get paid $15/hr smh 
$C: We did this all the time working at Burger King. My manager even hid a critical piece for the ice cream machine so he wouldn't have to clean it (or turn it on) anymore.  
The machine wasn't broken, he knew where the piece was.
$C: I believe Sonic is the same way. It's rare that I can get a milkshake from my local Sonic after 9pm because "sorry the ice cream machines aren't working right now."
$C: The machine breaks constantly and not everyone knows how to fix it, and when it goes down because of a heat cycle or it freezer locks, there’s nothing you can do for at least a few hours
$C: Former McDonald employee here.  No, we cleaned it daily and it was no where near the "pain to clean" as other equipment. The main problem is the machine can either overheat or freeze, and we have to wait for the "all-clear" light on the front to light up.
$C: Truth,  worked at one.
$C: I always knew this was the case and this is why it pissed me off to no end when they hand me that line.  Then there is the Del Taco machine that is forever broken because they simply never want to hastle with it.
$C: So what machine does every other place that serves ice cream use?This sounds like a well crafted excuse by the MacDonald's people lol I never have that problem at Hardee's or Arby's..

Or maybe Hardee's and Arby's have the easy to clean machines .

Either way MacDonald's is fuckin up
$C: Worked in McDonald’s this is total bollocks, they are shit and just break a lot 
$C: I dunno, I worked there for years and it really did break quite often...they had to get someone external to fix it, we weren't allowed to fiddle with it even if we thought it was an easy fix.
$C: My sister worked at a Maccas for years. It goes into self-cleaning (or maintenance or something) mode and you can't stop it. You essentially have to let it do its thing, which apparently takes as long as it decides it wants to.

$C: I have worked in restaurants for a long time, ice cream/yogurt machines are breeding grounds for bacteria as a result the stare pushes cleaning them up very well a few times a week. Compared to other equipment they really emphasize cleaning these machines.
$C: No myth. My mom used to work at McDonalds. The ice cream machine shuts down automatically to auto clean. The staff have no control. Instead of tell us the truth they lie to us. Ice cream is listed as an all day item at 24 hour locations. An easy fix would be to have ice cream be unavailable late at night and have the machines clean themselves then but what do I know. 
$C: No, you're not perpetuating a myth.

Next time they tell you the ice cream machine is broken, take out your phone and order your ice cream via the McDonalds app. The machine will miraculously start working.
$C: It's because of the heat cycle the machine has to complete. If it doesn't complete it properly at night, it'll do it during the day. 
$C: As someone who used to work in fast food (not McDicks), if it was really busy it was a coin toss whether it was actually broken or we just didn't want to make one. We also knew how to make the machine breakdown at will so that we needed to go through the whole cleaning process to get it working again.

Another thing though, when it got really hot in the kitchen the ice cream machine wasn't able to get cold enough to actually make ice cream. We found out that that was usually about 100F and when it got to 120F everything but the broiler, oven, and deep fryers would breakdown. Starting at about 110F the employees start to breakdown and by 130F everyone has broken down (our ac was out from early June to late September one year).
$C: Not the case in my store, that’s shit broke
$C: Fix the Frosty Boy machine at McMurdo Station.

&#x200B;

Then clean it.
$C: I’ll accept dirty ice cream. 
$C: It’s 2018 and we can’t get a Clean/ Working ice cream machine 🤔
$C: rotflmaopmp
$C: McDonald's uses 50/50 air to ice cream ratio. Dq uses 40 air to 60 ice cream mix. I literally have a hard time eating any other fast food joint ice cream because they all follow McDonald's formula. 
$C: Back in the day I did overnight maintenance at McDonald's. Took apart the fryers and ice cream machine every night. Lemme just say that it doesnt self clean
$C: Its not that they selfclean, its that it needs to heat the mixture daily to kill any possible bacteria in it.

That takes a couple hours indeed. For 24/7 stores it will happen when open.

Inside cleaning should happen every 2 weeks, taking everything out, sanatizing it ect. The daily heating keeps it safe.
$C: >They noticed there was a blank wall at mcdonald’s so they decided to make this fake poster of themselves. It’s now been 51 days since they hung it up.

next billion idea (unicorn) - a self-cleaning fully automated super awesome all things ice cream machine - even make it etc that makes mcdonalds profits go up by at least 10% combined with a good killer marketing campaign 
$C: Not true at all. Cleaning the machine is as simple as pressing a button. The cleaning cycle takes ~4 hours. 

The machines also break down when it gets too hot... which is quite often when it’s overworked (when it’s a hot day, for example). You would not want a milkshake or ice cream that has been served from a dirty machine. 

One of the fowlest things I’ve ever seen/smelled is the inside of the shake machine after it had clogged up and the mixture turned to a cheese-like substance. 

You’d be really pissed off if you were served anything from a dirty machine.

Why don’t we put up a sign saying it is out of order you ask? Because once you’re in the store and we tell you the shake machine is out of order you are much more likely to spend money in something else compared to if you were turned away at the door. 
$C: Teenagers are too lazy to replace orings and shit tho, and it's too complicated to put back together right. 
$C: false, I work at McDonalds. Does not need to be cleaned, ours cleans itself and keep in mind that every McDonald's does not have the same ice cream machine. Urban Myth #2903 busted.
$C: When i worked at mcdonalds in 07 we never lied about it. Just said we turned it off after 9pm.
$C: > Ours are cleaned every 30 days 

Uhhh

$C: >	Taylor the manufacturer

Is this the long lost cousin of Tyler the Creator?
$C: I worked at McDonald's for s few years and I don't recall having to clean all the internals every night.  Our manager was on top of her shit too when it came to food safety etc. The only thing I recall is the machine goes into a heat mode. You typically set that to be in the middle of the night of you are not a 24hr store. 
$C: They have to do work every day? At work?  Oh no
$C: Taylor doesnt clean ours, we have to do it every 2 weeks plus a regular sanitation multiple times a day. McDonald's must be a pain, unless they're exaggerating about having to clean the whole thing every night. 
$C: Daily? No they actually go into a heat cycle every night at a specific time. That much of a clean is only done or should only be done once a week
$C: Change the policy to cleaning it regardless of use and problem solved. If ur paid by the hour y would u care
$C: Yeah, I've only ever heard of the supposedly broken McDonald's ice cream machines on Reddit.
$C: You should also hurry and go eat at taco bell so you don't get diarrhea. Oh wait, you're probably just a normal person who has normal interactions at fast food restaurants. 
$C: Do you ever go later in the evening? It's quite common to be "broken" after about 10pm because they just disassembled and cleaned it for the night and don't wanna do it a second time.
$C: Nope, just the diabeetus
$C: No but you get the flu instead.


The local news ran one of them investigation pieces and according to that McDonald's ice cream machines were the dirtiest part of McDonald's food service and the dirtiest business of all the other places that serve ice cream because they don't clean the machines.
$C: You get a gold star, plus a uniform. You start on Monday.
$C: Thier usually not broken. Employees say they are after they've cleaned them for the day and don't wanna have to do it again. 
$C: A staged execution?
$C: So next time tell them to throw it in the HLZ. Its what we always did. In fact I've never seen fudge be a problem...they're usually just lying to you 
$C: Yesterday they apparently put caramel in the mocha thing so I couldn't get a mocha frappe. It really is always *something*. Breaks my heart when I can't get a hot fudge sundae.
$C: Milkshakes used to come in regular cups with regular lids. They realized people would pay more if it was in a fancy cup with a fancy lid and some whip topping. Same cheap goo but now pricier.
$C: They should have given you a large drink
$C: Who orders a medium drink when a large is the same price?
$C: Yeah, that's my reason.  And it got me 12,200 comment karma.  Can't argue with success.
$C: They had chocolate soft serve?  And I missed it?
$C: Not yet.
$C: I'd rather they have two machines and clean them on different schedules for the one time I go there a year just for the motherfucker at the window to tell me there's no shamrock shakes the day before St. Patrick's Day.

Why is the secret advertisement thing such a favorite conspiracy theory of reddit?
$C: > handsome

Eh, you're pushing it. They are both average.
$C: I don't think McDonald's really has to advertise. If there's one in your area you already know it. You re not going to see an ad and go "oh fuck, this picture of two men eating McDonald's makes me want to go to McDonald's, where the all new Big Mac Select is available with a large fries and Coca-Cola for 5.99 for a limited time at participating locations!  Needless to say, I'm loving it!"

...because that doesn't happen.
$C: Good cameras are pretty cheap and yep, there's a lot of brown people around the US and you can't identify them like they're fucking Pokemon. This is totally plausible.
$C: Did you just assume OP's ambiguity?
$C: It was on Twitter first. 
$C: >ethnically ambiguous

You mean clearly Asian?
$C: Ethnically ambiguous? They're obviously phillipino
$C: > models

Lol. You think they look like models? What kind of butt-ugly people do you live around?
$C: So the poster is real but the poster is fake!
$C: In after McD marketers replied to you trying to cast doubt on your implication.
$C: They're not even subtle about it either. Who really thinks that real people gave this 130K+ upvotes in 4 hours? Biggest load of advertising bullshit I've ever seen on the front page
$C: Really? I can't remember the last time I even saw a McDonalds post on reddit.
$C: And coca cola
$C: I don't know, but I'm Lovin' It™
$C: Same with Disney/Hollywood type stuff.
$C: McDonald's is one of the biggest brands in the world. It's not surprising to see things pop up involving them from time to time since they're in almost every country, and have a physical location.
$C: And something about russia? Am I doing this right?
$C: Guys don't be dumb, it's clearly just photoshopped in, which is why no one has noticed it 
$C: That or OP's lying about a random picture he found.

*Looks at OP's account history*

Yeah, OP is lying about a random picture he found.
$C: Computer people? You mean.....graphic designers?
$C: *damnit you kids pranked us good with your brazen hijinks.  I guess my staff will have to take the poster down, someday.  Just you wait!*
$C: hi its me ur computer people
$C: Top tier influencers
$C: A guy I used to work with has been making fake McDonalds, Hungry Jacks, KFC and Red Rooster vouchers since around 2006. He just writes up whatever deal he wants, prints them up, and they honour it. If he gets questioned, he just says something obscure "McDonalds were sponsoring the SuperTips footy tipping app. Every time you got 9/9 tips in a round, you won a free <whatever the voucher says>"
$C: Also it has random dotted circles for no reason except for the one that spotlights the fries, the real professional touch 
$C: Let’s not forget the glasses. Either nearsighted or farsighted individuals can also easily indulge in their favorite McDonald’s delight. 
$C: It's really well-done. There are some pointers with regards to branding but that's not even important.

It's a great poster. Totally deserves to be there.
$C: Nitpick: The McDonalds logo on the container of fries is partially covered up by one of the guys' fingers. I assume this is a huge marketing mistake.
$C: Pretty sure South East Asians
$C: this guy advertises 
$C: Wouldn't exactly call the fit. Just not overweight.
$C: This guy marketings

$C: [deleted]
$C: Man, you should be in marketing. Logic like this is the bread and butter of advertisements
$C: Also one is wearing *glasses* and is *two-strapping*, so must be *smart*, and the other is wearing a *cap* and is only *one-strapping*, so must be *cool*. Look at all these demographics we're ticking!
$C: > a royal with cheese

Is that something they actually serve at McDonalds, I have never heard of it, and I frequent McDonalds quite often.
$C: Unortunately no, there's no female, McDonalds is a male dominated patriarchal mega corporation that hates women because they're not in this McDonalds poster. /s 
$C: >For one, they're fit

Are we really lowering the bar of personal health in America so much that fit is defined as not being fat?
$C: And here we are reviewing it at the top of reddit, as if it wasn't advertising or promotional. /r/hailcorporate.
$C: They made a video about how the pulled it off:

https://youtu.be/0rJHC6nY4F8
$C: > For one, they're fit, which would give the viewer the impression that McDonald's is good for you.

They're not fit... they're just not fat
$C: >For one, they're fit

Damn, does that count as fit for americans?
$C: You earned my upvote with the royale with cheese remark hehe
$C: Plus, it has those random circles with dots, so you know it was a professional graphic designer at work.
$C: Also one of them clearly has a secret crush on the other so the fandom community can write ships about it
$C: I like how I have travelled enough to know that since you are not calling it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese that you are likely not an American but someone somewhere in Europe and that makes me happy. Also the McDonald's in Paris near the Moulin Rouge is horrible never eat there. (Yes, I make a point of sampling the local McDonald's for regional menu items when I travel. I just like comparing. For example the buns are toasted in France).
$C: The fact that they're wearing unbranded, imageless clothing is also a plus. 
$C: These mad men ain’t got paid the thousands that ad agencies do. They are just legends.
$C: They're also captured in conversation, which is undoubtedly about deep philosophical subject matter.  McFood for thought.
$C: Well it certainly works better than what my and my friend Dave would produce.  Unless McD's really wanted two overweight white guys leaning against a slightly dinged-up Mazda 3 set against a background of a Liquor Land store, each with a box of chicken nuggets.  Somehow I think that poster could have come down within 4 minutes.
$C: what is it with white people and exotic/ambiguous races? 

are they convinced if they ask enough of people "what they are" (like that isn't an existential crisis in a bottle. what am I? pretty loaded question) eventually one of them is gonna slip up and admit to being an alien?
$C: Also they are good looking but not too good looking so they are relatable.
$C: I feel like I’m back in one of those business classes I took as an elective before I realized I hated business. But this was more interesting than the 30-minute slide show breaking down how Apple was pushing its new iPod gadget to make people want to carry “digitized music”.

Yes, I’m getting old. Yes, I’m still bitter about those 30 minutes.
$C: Plus you have the guy on the left having a straighter stance, glasses, and wearing his backpack with both straps, giving off a slightly nerdy vibe. Contrast with the guy on the right, with the hat, earring, and only using one strap, giving off a more cool vibe. So McDonalds is not only for all kinds of people, it also brings together groups that are usually separate.
$C: > For one, they're fit

They're not fit, they're at a normal fitness level.
$C: Shouldn’t the burger have a perfect bite taken out of it?  
$C: Now I want fries. 
$C: !redditsilver
$C: Honestly it gives me the McCraving, but I always forget about the McHangover.

Great analysis btw
$C: No other discernible brands as well. The brim of the hat is turned slightly up, and if there is a North Face logo on the fry holder’s backpack, it is covered by his hand.
$C: This guy markets.
$C: >a royale with cheese

French detected
$C: Wayamint, you mean to tell me I can be fit and eat McDonald's?
$C: *3 days later*

Front page of Reddit: Men who made the fake McDonalds poster get recruited into McDonalds marketing team 
$C: They don't call it a quarter pounder?
$C: I understood all of those references.
$C: This guy graphic-designs.

&#x200B;

...do you?
$C: It would be hilarious if in 20 years they were all 200+ pounds and have huge guts and retook the same picture.
$C: I can hear Don Draper’s voice pitching this in my head
$C: >They're of two different somewhat ambiguous races

Harold & Kumar go to McDonald's
$C: They demonstrate real understanding of proper marketing so it's going to be hilarious when we learn that they're physics majors or something. 
$C: My only issue with your statement is that you used the term **races**, I think **ethnicities** would be a bit more pc. We are the human *race*, if you have ancestry in different places than the majority around you, you are *ethnic*.
$C: Do you often overthink this much?
$C: How is your life as a media critic working out?  Seems like you have it dialed in!!  :)

Seriously... in real life do you assess / comment professionally?
$C: Your reply kept getting better the more I read. 
$C: o_o Is this what my mind is supposed to go through when I view an ad? I've never considered these aspects of an ad ever. 
$C: Makes me wonder if those guys are in marketing, design, or both. Either that or just really clever with the use of everything you said.
$C: There’s also a bin in the background as a subtle reminder to dispose of the trash properly. 
$C: Wait “mad men” as in the show about advertisers? Clever boy 
$C: I like how your comment reads as tongue-in-cheek but it's literally true. It hits multiple bases just like the poster!
$C: > can get along and have a thoughtful and humorous conversation about, say, a royale with cheese.

Someone call the UN. This mother fucker just solved world peace.

$C: One of the reasons they wanted to put it up was because none of the posters in the McDonald's had any Asian people on them.
$C: And the best part: they made it for free.
$C: Tbh how do these things make people buy things? I usually only feel like advertising has worked on me when I already enjoy the product. I don't care about two randos eating the food because I know it's a staged picture and it's unhealthy anyways plus I'll eat it when I want it not because an ad has some stock food they've had for years 
$C: They also had enough foresight not to wear branded clothing
$C: Plus, they’re wearing brandless clothing.
$C: They're thinking "after this royale with cheese, let's go check in on our big-brained friend Brad".
$C: And he is still eating fries! That fiend!
$C: r/madlads
$C: Another long winded response
$C: Also funny because they probably only split the hamburger and fries to save money, only having to buy one meal to get their photo. 

The random dotted circles are really what make it for me. Only "artists" add stupid shit like that to their photos. 
$C: Except for maybe, is there an outline around the logo? That definitely is against branding guidelines
$C: And it was free.
$C: >ambiguous races 

Dude, they’re straight up Filipino.
$C: Quarter pounder?
$C: McDonald's is not good for me?
$C: This guy markets.
$C: The only place theyre going is McDonald's corporate, because they were hired by them.
$C: This guy advertises 
$C: This guy markets
$C: McDonald's trying to sneak this in like they didnt have a hand in this
$C: And the average looking guy
$C: Lol I love this comment
$C: And they look like gay couple, so that is important in 2018.
$C: Uh..they arent fit, theyre just skinny.


$C: I intensely dislike ambiguous races and the obligatory mixed race advertising.  It is offensively contrived and pandering. JMO
$C: However there is a trash can visible
$C: My local McDonald's only has pictures of kids eating McDonald's and I don't mean there are a few I mean EVERY picture is of a small child, it's kind of unsettlingly creepy. 
$C: This guy markets
$C: It’s the poster child of posters.
$C: Also the fact they don’t have any brand labels on their clothing or accessories showing. 
$C: Chill out with your Media GCSE shit!
$C: Fit's a bit on the generous side.
$C: Also no labels on their clothes, which would be a dead giveaway. 
$C: I was waiting for the damn wwe refrence. 
$C: And that is how snake oil is made!
$C: r/madlads on the way to becoming r/madmen
$C: One thing i do find odd is that the fries isn’t filled to the brim like how advertised fast food should look like. 
$C: It also is a trash can in the photo so you get the feeling that McDonals is fried garbage 
$C: it looks...too professional
$C: This dude markets
$C: the dudes burger even looks picture perfect, how did he get it like that even lol 
$C: Found the quebecer 
$C: > french fry fiend

ughh

$C: this guy advertises mcdonalds
$C: Also from a costume designer perspective, their clothing is free of logos, labels, and copyrighted art.
$C: Is this an ad about the ad?
$C: The dotted circle around the fries is also a nice touch. ‘Hm, what would complete my meal? Why yes, some French fries!’ 
$C: Self made McDonald's posters will now become a thing, maybe someone should create a sub reddit and get ahead of it? 
$C: Dudes just used McDonald’s to launch a modeling career.
$C: McDonalds tricked reddit by making this seem the guys don't work for them
$C: The project was more of a critique on the lack of Asian representation in McDonalds' signage. 
$C: Is this Astroturfing?? I don't even know anymore...
$C: This is definitely marketing on McDonald's part.
$C: Always go by Occam's razor, assume you're being conned or sold a bridge. Going around assuming otherwise on Reddit just leads to later disappointment. 🧐
$C: This is the third time I've seen McDonald's on the frontpage in a really short span of time. /r/hailcorporate
$C: No way, people *always* walk into restaurants with giant posters and *put them on the wall unnoticed*. And in every case the restaurant just leaves it up there for a couple of months. Why do you have to be such a *cynic*?
$C: viral marketing campaigns like this are a very much a thing though so you don't have to hedge that hard, it is a legit suspicion. I mean this has 107K upvotes in 3hrs, ties into social awareness and pop culture going on right now, etc etc. having a making of video doesn't prove the contrary. /conspiracy!
$C: This seems just like Alex from Target, except it's McDonald's diversity edition. Funny and relatable, but feels staged as fuck.
$C: Nope it’s a tide ad
$C: Not sure if this is a GEICO or a Tide ad now
$C: What's "really sophisticated" about it? It's just a blatant guerilla marketing campaign, including the making of video. They knew redditors would eat that shit up.
$C: #Jollibee lol
$C: Nah, it’s a Tide ad
$C: This is basically next-level shop-dropping.
$C: Canvas of this size is > $200 for sure
$C: Oh my god so right. Paper. Ink. Priceless resources. 

Who has that kind of access? Maybe they’re Saudi princes? 
$C: I guess. 
$C: Not really. Like ~$25 at Walgreens for a poster that size. 
$C: It is. Pretty text book viral marketing play
$C: You're an ad!
$C: I'd be surprised if it weren't 
$C: No shit. The giveaway is that the cost of wall art that large and of that quality would be like out of the question for two McDonald’s employees. 
$C: There's no way this post gets to the #1 of /r/all without purchasing upvotes. This is ridiculous.
$C: Both. It's too good. Also is there an explanation about how it got hung? 
$C: 
Yes.

$C: You best start believing in viral ad campaigns... You're in one. 
$C: 
>You're talking about this entire post in general right? Because this is all a McDonalds ad, and you're participating in it right now.

Why does everyone with the conspiracy shit repeat their name over and over?
$C: Just to add some balance to the advert - personally I think McDonalds tastes like shit.
$C: I think those dotted circles really sell the illusion. 

Nothing screams corporate design like stupid dotted circles all over the place.
$C: By that theory, if I take a shirtless photo of myself, and put a logo of Calvin Klein, people will believe I'm a model?
$C: Yes McDonald’s needs Reddit so bad.

It isn’t already in 150 countries and on every street corner. 
$C: Haha, gorilla.
$C: "GoD DaMN MIlLeNnIaLs Huur Duur"
$C: Because the poster is not really the add, the tweet and Reddit post are
$C: No one is questioning how he did this, only why he decided to make a piece of marketing material at his own expense, and why Reddit ate it up to the tube of 170k upvotes.
$C: I've been seeing quite a few posts related to McDonald's recently. Reddit really is an advertising free for all for these fast food companies.

2. They're advertising, marketing, or design students and this is going to get them a job.
$C: They get the enjoyment of sending their friends there to see it, knowing they were crafty and sneaky enough to pull it off, etc. I think it's pretty legendary in its own right. 
$C: Sounds like smart/sneaky marketing to me
$C: Tell chicks your an actor/model and gesture to the poster
$C: I wonder if you could build up your modeling portfolio by simply putting up your picture in stores all over the place, maybe do a nationwide thing where you suddenly start appearing in stores all across the country.
$C: Those dudes also made a video about making it happen and got like 10k views on it so yay?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rJHC6nY4F8&feature=youtu.be
$C: McDonalds does. 
$C: Or it's an actual ad made by or commissioned by McDonald's and the two guys that were in it went to a store to pose beneath the poster of them.
$C: It would be good PR for McD to see this, pay these dudes, and put this poster in all of their restaurants.   They’d be on Ellen next week... 
$C: >These dudes don't actually get anything out of this lol

Depends on what they are studying.

Assuming, that is, that this isn't just McDonalds Marketing Team.
$C: Make that 100,000 upvotes.
$C: But it makes Mcdonalds look kind of shitty, because the whole point was that McDonalds didn't include any pictures of asians in their restaurant, so these people secretly put one up.
$C: Uh no. This was a legitimate ad produced by McDonald's. You've been fooled
$C: looks like 142,000 now.
$C: I think it's a little more than 700 now.
$C: Don't forget spent 500-1000 bucks for the "joke."
$C: I don't think  McDonalds gets those upvotes guy
$C: > 700

The post is now up to 165k and counting.
$C: 174,000 upvotes doesn't seem suspicious at all.  /s
$C: 191k upvotes, motherfucker.
$C: Ooooh I like that 
$C: Could still do it... 51 days it's for sure in background and no seeing it mode
$C: /r/madlads
$C: Awh that's fucking genius mate
$C: Every few days, make one small change.
$C: Or just make some stickers to go over parts of it. Add a new logo each week to it
$C: [removed]
$C: It would have been, but it probably wouldn't have lasted as long as this one
$C: hell, just go full nut sack and do a McDowell's ad.
$C: No one looks that closely, and plus as a prank right now it's cool but it's not really pranking anyone since it just furthers McDonald's goals. 
$C: The alternative is what we have where there never was a joke. Only free advertising.
$C: That’s actually really cool! I was worried you were going to say the bar took it down right away. Sorry for the loss of your local bar though, thts a bummer.
$C: Reddit doesn't want answers, we like to think we know everything already. 
$C: How did they wrangle and hang a giant poster without any of the employees noticing?
$C: To be fair, there's nothing offensive on it and it is in fact promoting McDonald's. If I were the manager of that location, I'd think it was awesome, even if I knew it was fake. Maybe especially if I knew it was fake.
$C: Who has questions over this... they put their picture on the wall y’all 
$C: The comment is currently at the top
$C: Don't you actually think it's a little bit suspicious that they had a professional quality youtube video ready to roll-out the same day they made their reddit post to conveniently counter claims of corporate advertising?

And that this video features even *more* shots of McDonalds restaurants and McDonalds products ("We were just hanging out munching on some McDonalds Snack Wraps" was an actual line from the video) and shenenigans with them dressed up in McDonalds uniforms and lots and lots and lots of prominent shots of McDonalds logos?

This doesn't shut down any claims of corporate advertising on reddit, if nothing else it reinforces them. This video looks like even more viral advertising for McDonalds.
$C: I dunno... I kind of like reading answers or just speculating. Videos not so much.
$C: Relax!
$C: Its not 'best' anymore.  We did it reddit!
$C: I feel like also people have stopped to read this/watch the link and forgot to upvote. I came back to this post now, a few hours later, expecting this to be top comment because it gave me so much context and realised I forgot to upvote the comment myself haha 
$C: At the top, an hour after he posted, dont make judgements a few minutes after someone posts a comment....
$C: because why...?
$C: Here is the thing people lie for money. People lie online. I honestly believe these people were paid 100% by McDonalds and they are lying.
$C: hahahahahaha u right
$C: Grab the pitchforks
$C: damn you got me bro :(
$C: Is it? What about it is so great?
$C: lmao technically they have a policy instore that you can't print anything copyright, but I don't think managers and copy print people are paid enough to give a fuck
$C: not really sure about that tbh. i know i’ve printed stuff through like office depot and walgreens with brand logos (i studied advertising) on it for school projects and haven’t been stopped. the design and photo is completely original, they just slapped the logo on it.
$C: A trademark is not a copyright. 
$C: Oh, come on. You know you guys like to pretend we don’t exist. 
$C: he’s already been contacted by radio stations, buzzfeed, bbc, etc.!!! lol
$C: gotta keep it wholesome!
$C: i’m actually a lady :)
$C: he says thanks!
$C: Nice
$C: Your comment is kind of a compliment. And so also kind of an insult.
$C: i hope in a good way!
$C: if you know my friend, he’s very committed to being extra lol
$C: not in it for the karma (not my project anyway and he doesn’t use reddit). just want my friend to get the credit :)
$C: really? a mega corporation liked an inoffensive viral marketing campaign they didn't pay for? that's shocking
$C: let me know if you want to contact him, i can hook y’all up 😂
$C: Houston 🤘🏼🤘🏼
$C: he really appreciates the support!!! 🙏🏼🙏🏼
$C: lol as mentioned, he studies media production aka video editing. not too hard if you know how to do it!
$C: Yeah, definitely, the 135k upvotes indicate that nobody in the world found this entertaining or funny. You cracked the case, Fun At Parties Guy.
$C: nope, just customers who had a weird idea and executed it lol
$C: not yet!
$C: lady!!! but thanks for making me feel legit :D
$C: nope, houston 🤘🏼
$C: probably good 🤷🏻‍♀️
$C: i do too lol
$C: HELL YES!!!!!!!
$C: he’s great! we grew up together and he’s always gotten into crazy antics like this :)
$C: hope life being a debbie downer is fun. it’s just some college kids doing stupid shit chill out lol
$C: idk man i don’t tell my friends how to spend their time/money lol. i’m just here to make sure he’s getting credit for his work. like i said, he wants to work in media, so i’m sure the attention he’s getting is gonna be good for his career.
$C: he appreciates it, bro 👌🏼👌🏼
$C: he says thank you very much!!!
$C: $85 at office depot actually. which is still a lot, but if you know him, he’s pretty committed and will go extra lengths to make shit happen lol
$C: Receipt for the poster is in the video. Think it showed it was around $85. It's a prank, has nobody ever invested time/money in a prank before?

$C: It did make me grimace 
$C: Hamburglarilla. 
$C: That was clever. 
$C: I need to be in a room that erupts in bonuses. 
$C: And that mans name? Albert Einstein
$C: You beat me to it
$C: Understandable 
$C: Asians are sooooo in right now.  Have you seen *Crazy Rich Asians*? ^in^theaters^now
$C: I’m craving a big Asian man named Mac.
$C: The only thing better is pairing that with Any Size Soft Drink or Sweet Tea for just $1!
$C: If it makes you feel any better these guys didn't get paid to do it they just have a YouTube channel and want to be big time vloggers. I grew up with one 
$C: Companies can either:

1. Maintain multiple accounts with enough activity to appear legit, then use them for astroturfing  (one or two interns can maintain numerous accounts this way).

2. Buy high-karma reddit accounts from users  (numerous ways to do this)

3. Pay an advertising firm that specializes in social media  (e.g. Revolution Messaging) to maintain accounts and make comments/posts that promote your brand. 
$C: Seems like a bored marketing student tbh. 
$C: 1.1M post karma is a little bit more than “an active Reddit user”, but hey that’s just me
$C: I’m not sure how it usually works, but I think this scenario is a little different. I saw it blowing up on Twitter/YT before it was posted here. So I’m guessing OP saw it and posted it. If McDonalds was ever directly involved, I’d assume it was from the beginning directly with those kids. But idk, might’ve just worked out randomly for Mcd’s.
$C: I think that McDonald's will need to be very careful on how they handle this. Sure this may have worked out as a good bit of advertising, but Corporations like this have so much money invested in their brand that they really can't condone people using it without permission. This could have very easily been received negatively.
$C: Was there any actual proof that was an ad? Or reddit just being paranoid? That account still posts regularly, he even talks shit about uber eats and McDonald's sometimes.
$C: Lol, Reddit actually called that one out. 

Makes me want to investigate this one further.

If I haven't reported back, I've probably forgotten about it. 
$C: McDonald's employees don't get paid enough to give a shit. And the store manager probably assumed some district manager stopped by and put it up without telling them.
$C: Look further down, there's a video of them doing it for proof
$C: Well, it is an ad for Mcdonalds now. That's how good corporate advertising is ingrained in our psyche. 
$C: Love that sub! Out of this world cool! Right fam!
$C: Legit what you hear everytime you go into a McDonald's and it's over 80 degrees.  
$C: Of all the viral marketing for Redditors does McDonald's really need to sneaky sneaky themselves into people's minds? 
$C: Well, actually Banksy is well known for surreptitiously hanging his artwork in very well known high security museums.  But in his case, it's a bit cooler than doing so in McDonalds, like how much of a shill does one need to be for a huge corporation that's marketing is already ingrained in us since childhood. 
$C: A billon dollar company’s marketing department isn’t that clever? 
$C: Well I mean, there's not even any *reason* to question it. It looks great, fits the brand, and in general dies exactly what corporate would have wanted an in-store poster to do. 

If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Amirite?
$C: Every week or two they get new promotional stuff with directions usually on where to put it up.  if nothing was supposed to go on that wall, no one probably is going to take it down for a long time.  everyone will just assume someone else put it up.
$C: I would absolutely not rat these guys out if I worked there and noticed.
$C: i worked at mcdonald’s for three years, i cared a little bit but definitely wouldn’t have noticed something like what looks like a real poster being put up or have mentioned it to anyone
$C: it certainly occurred to me.

a viral post could be very cheap advertising
$C: It could be so. However, it doesn't paint McDonald's in a good way and really could only benefit that one location. So I say it's very unlikely.

I mean, even my jaded self due years being here in the states, in rare occasion the white-americans-only theme does irritate me. To do something like this as a "why not?" Seems fine.
$C: Astroturfing campaign, yup, seems likely.
$C: It didn't happen
$C: Enlighten me.
$C: Maybe they also have add ons for sale. McDonald's always needs good employees 👍🏻
$C: Why buy the cow when you get the milk for free? 
$C: ... So they continue doing it?
$C: By free, did you mean for their paycheck from McDonald's?
$C: The American Way
$C: Someone has to be making money on instangram besides all the jacked hotty Indra fitness models 
$C: You're joking if you think they weren't paid for this. All of this looks like a marketing campaign. Printing a poster that size on a board is hundreds of dollars. The mcdonalds embroidered uniform is also real and not cheap. As others mentioned, there are no other brands in their clothes and its played straight. Also they drilled holes in the wall of a mcdonalds without getting kicked out. No one would do this for fun and get away with it. Its clearly mcdonalds astroturf marketing.
$C: I think you're taking this to seriously. 
$C: I think you took this to seriously. 
$C: Corporate were on the phone the day before, demanding that he buys more "wall-mounted purchase incrementers" otherwise he'd lose his franchise. And he saw there was no money in the budget. So that night he went to bed and prayed.
$C: *in every job.  
$C: There’s always one. I used to be that guy. I wanted decisions to matter, rules to be upheld. Turns out the service industry isn’t the right place for that attitude. 

So I joined the military. No joke. Did pretty well for myself there
$C: I imagine [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w70RQLtdVeU).
$C: We're all a liitle bit of Steve
$C: I really hope you worked at McDonalds
$C: That's the best part. 
$C: And the other one was the Assistant to the Regional Interior Coordinator
$C: Hey, I'm the "Regional Interior Coordinator" and I'm here to hang up this picture. 

This is a picture of you.

I'm also a part time McModel.
$C: So basically everyone who works there just thought it was put up for real so why would they question its authenticity?
$C: And they didn't drill any holes, they used command strips. They actually have a "how we did this" [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rJHC6nY4F8).
$C: Man, these guys went 100% "oceans eleven" for this operation. They sound fun.
$C: It's just really unclear how we're suppose to feel about that hamburger.
$C: Whats with the sexy tongue? 
$C: I don't know why, but I first read that as "Regional Interior Crocodile Alligator"
$C: I was about to say these guy had just created a great social engineering opportunity: now they can pretend the ad is real and show model agency this picture and get hired because they now have "did an ad for McDonald" in their resume. 

But fuck me these guys don't need any tips they are /r/socialengineering masters. 
$C: Wow.

I wish I had this much dedication to... Well anything.
$C: This has to be viral marketing stunt.
$C: So he used to work at Mcdonald's? 
$C: It actually worked out perfectly because they didn't even have to buy or make fake uniforms they just used the ones they have for their job at mcDonalds.
$C: Regional Interior to the Coordinator
$C: How illegal is that? These people can be sued pretty badly right?
$C: Velcro command strips.
$C: The progress no one is talking about.
$C: This needs to be higher up! 
$C: With this video and WHY they did it, and how they pulled it off, McDonalds would have a very tough time taking it down without backlash. 

It SEEMS to match their other design, its by no means offensive, it looks professional, and everything about it is great, at least to the general public. 

The only things I could think of (stretching my company's marketing guidelines to think of MAYBE why this wouldn't fit McD's marketing guidelines) are just technicalities. Like maybe they ring around the fry box show be better centered around it, his finger is over the logo, there is a trash can in the background, etc.

Additionally, if these guys end up causing some bad PR, McD's wouldn't want their pictures posted in their restaurant. 

That being said, if McD's wanted to use that type of technicality as an excuse to remove this, they'd have to replace the poster with another one featuring Asians, unless they want backlash from it. 
$C: Sponsored by McDonald’s 
$C: “How they pulled it off” like sticking an ad on the wall is ultimate heist.
$C: I love tape when it's assertive


$C: That’s exactly what they did. 

https://youtu.be/0rJHC6nY4F8
$C: But the guys get into her
$C: Damnit. Out of all the numbers reddit can generate from your real karma score, they choose 69.
$C: they made it onto ellen haha
guess theyre not into girls either 😉 
$C: Good fucking point. Didn’t think of that 
$C: How is that elaborate? It's "less" elaborate than the filming of a traditional ad. Cheaper, too. 
$C: You don’t think a multi billion dollar company can afford to pay two kids to make a realistic video?


Do you really believe  that the line is drawn at a video? When it is obvious and you even conceded it could be an astroturfing campaign ? 


$C: That made me giggle like a school girl
$C: For how many precautions they were taking I'm surprised they did it at night. That'd be the oddest part. I'd imagine early AM makes more sense. Also after all those precautions, nobody in the restaurant even batted an eye lol
$C: I don't see what the purpose of the disguise was if the plan was sneaking it up when nobody was looking anyway.
$C: Intentionally yet inadvertently advertising for a massive global corporation is still hail corporate. 
$C: Damn....that was pretty cool watching this in action 
$C: those 4 tiny adhesive strips were enough?
$C: What does that prove? There are only a handful of videos on that channel
$C: This is the coolest thing Ever! They did such a good job! 
$C: Post this to the top comment so people stop assuming this is a marketing campaign.
$C: o they made a video? must be real then
$C: > Nope

Wow, you sure solved it.  There's definitely no way the professional-quality video about adding diversity to a McDonald's location, and then staging a big production inside a McDonald's was in any way paid for by McDonald's.  No way McDonald's would hire someone to do that to increase viral marketing.

Christ you're stupid.  The 'unpaid' YouTube user's other videos are fucking commercials for the fucking Marriott, for fucks sake.
$C: When “conspiracy theorists” are saying they are programming you , it isn’t fucking chem trails and it isn’t fluoride in water, there is very good evidence suggesting those are disinformation campaigns.

  It’s  this. 

Hypernormalization 
$C: > which means reddit is likely getting kickbacks

Reddit prefers the term *monetized* 
$C: "Most" and "likely", the two words that every conspiracy theorist loves to toss about to safeguard them from being wrong, and lend more weight to their delusions. 

It's already been proven this isnt viral marketing so take the tinfoil hat off, champ. 
$C: Holy tinfoil hat
$C: Right, its not like McDonalds paid the guy for all of it. Definitely not like hes got his own production logo blatantly displayed or anything. Definitely not like his other videos are promotional montages or anything.

I too, like to get together with friends and spend a lot of time and money giving corporations free advertising.
$C: tbf OP never claimed he was the one who did it. Just shared it... What's the issue?
$C: Found the shill
$C: No shit captain obvious 
$C: what a reddit answer. 
$C: Yes it is.
$C: NICE DUDE! AND PEOPLE TOTALLY DON'T NEED FACEBOOK OR LINKEDIN TO MAKE CONNECTIONS AND GET JOBS SO THEY CAN SURVIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE OVER HALF OF AMERICANS DON'T EVEN HAVE $1000 SAVED UP FOR EMERGENCIES.

**EPIC COMMENT!**
$C: You think I'm joking? Low level news outlets get their reporter monkeys out on the field to orchestrate disasters or hire actors.

People will look at this reddit post and think "well shit, that's original to me. It must be real!" It's all subconscious. 


$C: "We're young and eat at mcdonalds, lets hire a professional photographer to make us one of those expensive near-tapestry sized posters and hang it up at a fast food restaurant for no reason!
$C: Bro what? Take a picture, edit in photoshop, have it printed. It's a poster so not that expensive, do you really think some young people wouldn't want their picture on the wall because they found it funny. Yes it took some effort but this wasn't that hard. 
$C: this is a really good friend of mine and if you know him, extravagant pranks like this is stuff that he’s known for doing. he’s also known for his attention to detail and his commitment to being “extra” lol. 
$C: And yet your life is boring enough to whine every time a brand is mentioned online
$C: Or even for something simple like, oh i dont know, change the url slightly for a website revealing a giant security flaw and immediately inform the company. 
$C: In my area mcdonals pays more than most starting at 1q$
$C: > It’s not totally implausible.

no i suppose not. i live in a city and all the mcdonalds here are pretty chaotic; theyre always packed and theres customers and employees running around everywhere so this seemed pretty weird to me. 
$C: Yes, it's a win / win and funny.
$C: I too stand skeptical of those Golden Arches
$C: Well, the next post in my Reddit feed is a photography of a McDonald's location.

I confirm that McDonald's have now invaded Reddit!
$C: I don't think McDonald's is smart enough to pull this off.
$C: Why not 
$C: If you can photoshop one photo you can photoshop 3... 

At least the feed confirms I picked the right location. 
$C: Well, that's how I'd hang a "real" poster.. 
$C: Bye
$C: this is an extremely stupid comparison. if you're a fan of a band then it's in your best interest to make them more popular (so that they are more likely to make more music). music is also an art form, it's not a corporation with the whole purpose of making money; you're not 'advertising' davinci if you wear a t-shirt with the mona lisa on it. doing free work for a random mcdonalds is not having an effect beyond wasting your own time
$C: and they took a pic and look at it now
$C: not anymore.  This post made me buy 2 happy meals
$C: Not exactly a traditional ad per se, but lots of ads are about brand recognition. Like why does coke/Pepsi still advertise? Everyone knows they exist. It's about keeping that brand fresh on your mind. Another type of advertising is association advertising. This type of ad would be for associating a brand with cool things. In the past this would usually be celebrity endorsements. Now it might be trying to associate it with youthful, healthy, and diversity, like fit Asian students, for example. So when you come in, you subconsciously aren't filled with self loathing because you've seen pictures of happy young healthy people eating there.

 Ads of today aren't about trying to get you to change your plans that day and go buy something. It's about keeping it on your mind positively so next time you're in the mood for food, you consider McDonald's instead of alternative choices.
$C: When you go to a place and the decor is all nice, do you feel it would be nice to come back? Specially when they are holding two of the most popular products there.

The picture definitely added value to the store (vs. an empty wall) and the guys paid for it. 
$C: If they monetize the video McDonald’s will be all over it to take the video down and find the store
$C: The ad is on reddit.
$C: Then why does every business do it? Why do cars have their logo on the steering wheel that you stare at every time you drive? Cmon man smarten up. 
$C: Link?
$C: Probably just people who don’t appreciate subs as hashtags.  It’s okay.  
$C: Because it's a McDonalds ad.
$C: Bots :)
$C: 👌 great now I don’t feel manipulated. I’m off to the local McDonald’s for some fries and nuggets.  
$C: That's what you think.
$C: I would say my sense for the talent of people is firing on all cylinders, thank you very much!
$C: Maybe they don't care, as long as updoots happen. Sad.
$C: Ya, I mean I completely disagree. There is absolutely food that shouldn’t be consumed by people imo. And to be clear I’m not hating on your choices at all. I’m a firm believer of each their own. Still surprises me though. 
$C: All that for a drop of blood?
$C: Nah, I work in marketing at a Fortune-50 company. 
$C: Good bot 
$C: No they didn’t? That’s the whole point of the post
$C: I commend you!
$C: My comment was sarcastic. However, it's surely possible the video was produced by McDonald's. 
$C: I'm lovin' it.
$C: Can you read? Idiot
$C: Haha yeah I'm not kidding. Can you tell me what I'm missing here??
$C: That’s a real poster then. 
$C: !Lol! 
$C: Aye OP's friend! How are ya?
$C: It's already clean. They don't want to make it dirty. 
$C: The smell...  I haven’t had to clean one in 20 years now, but that sour milk smell is still in my brain.  I don’t get milkshakes because of it.
$C: Wanna impress me? Send nudes.

Ice cream would also be nice
$C: You think they clean them?
$C: Wendys has frostys at 50c us or $1 cdn.
$C: Botulism sundae anyone? 
$C: When I worked there (many years ago now) it was the same machine.

The whole system would shut down if it wasn't cleaned often enough or there was ANY minor issue. It just goes into lockdown mode and the entire things needs to be stripped and cleaned.

The process can take like 1-2hrs depending which model too. 

I have no idea if they improved it but we had to schedule people around that machine. At all times we needed someone who knew how to strip and clean it AND not leave a station just empty while they did it.

It was just super sensitive to any little thing and if any PART breaks... the fucker is down for weeks since getting a replacement part would take soooooooo long.

When I worked there I hated telling people it was down. Felt like a huge letdown. It was the closest mcdonalds to the countryside too so sometimes people had driven like 30-45m to do errands and grab their meal and were let down.

We tried. I promise we tried... but sometimes we just couldn't handle the shitty machine that didn't recognize it was JUST cleaned and 10 minutes into operation shuts down with a random error because it wasn't done "just right" or put back together in slightly the wrong order (despite it going together 40 different ways no issue) 

That thing was a pain in the ass. 

Luckily we had an above average one. We knew a few stores with the same machine that misbehaved way more... 

I feel for those stores. I never thought they were just lazy after working at mcdonalds. I leaned way more toward the "fuck that machine" mentality after.

After 12 years I think I can still strip and clean that machine from memory.

2-3x a day, every day.

Supposedly it only needed it once a day but we did open, close and sometimes a mid if it broke.
$C: I work at mcdonalds and usually other than the  head manager no one knows a shit about the machine the least I've done is add the milk mix and make sub-par ice creams. Usually when it's broke it's because of cleaning purposes. We're sad when people only come to buy ice-creams and we have to offer them something else and they say can I have a sundae? Or a shake? Best bet is you want ice cream go to dairy Queen for the love of God
$C: Same one.
$C: Holy crap.  I always get so mad when I'm craving latenight ice.cream or milkshake.   Don't think I've ever got one!  
$C: Those green milkshakes.
$C: The one when I worked would do a ~4 hour self clean every night,  usually sometime between midnight and 6am, but every now and then would go off early like at 10pm or something.  Then every week or two one of the managers would strip it and clean everything.   

Felt like most nights I never had to turn anyone down, but then nights where everyone wants ice cream it would be shut off. 
$C: Yes, it is actually the same machine
$C: This guy milkshakes 
$C: The McDonalds I worked at cleaned the machine nightly, I can't remember it ever smelling foul when it broke down.

Also there was definitely manual intervention required in the cleaning process.
$C: I imagine it probably has more to do with training (with that machine) and high turn over than it does with "lazy teenagers."
$C: [This article seems to clear things up and confirms at least for the McDonald's at which you work.](https://www.rd.com/food/fun/mcdonalds-ice-cream-machines/)
$C: Makes sense to me
$C: Depends on location, management, and guests. If the guests tend to be shitty in your area, you start lying.
$C: Like the small internal bits and shit. We clean the basin and stuff like that every night at 1am. 
$C: I mean it could just be the one around here. Idk. 
$C: Ya, you get yelled at if you do it because it keeps you there too late, and you only might get yelled at if you lie to a customer. 

It tracks back to management having unrealistic expectations of how long people should be staying behind after their shift to finish their job.

And that just leads to apathy and laziness on all aspects of the job, because you have to skip a lot of things anyways to get out at the time you're 'supposed to'. May as well skip more to make your life easier, it's not going to make you yelled at any less. In many ways the cleanup *isn't* part of the job because the management doesn't want to pay for it.  

Oh, and the extra hours are usually just . . . cut. So it's more like 'they have do unpaid work every day at work'. 
$C: That shit only happened to me in the 90s.
$C: Neither of you go to McDonald's often and neither of you try ordering ice cream often. It's that simple, what are you two bragging about/trying to imply?
$C: I'm the taco baron. Tacos can't hurt me. 
$C: I already left this comment but this is 100% true. I used to work there in high school. We never lied about it tho. We would not have turned it back on for anyone and even if we wanted to it would take forever to get running again.
$C: Makes sense. I'm never there later than 7pm unless I'm too drunk to remember. 
$C: Oh this lady was trying her best to pump it out. I was watching. She filled a cup with hot water and poured in beside the container thinking it would immediately warm it up. 
$C: They obviously use the same lids
$C: Because then I will drink a large drink. 
$C: Comment karma does nothing though it's not like they send you money now lol. 
$C: They used to and it was actually pretty good. I’ve heard there are a few McDonalds that still have it but I can’t confirm. 

They list chocolate ice cream cone on their web site. https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/product/chocolate-cone-large.html

They also list a twist cone (i.e. half chocolate, half vanilla). https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/product/twist-cone-large.html

And it seems that chocolate ice cream disappeared to make room for McFlurries. https://yourquestions.mcdonalds.ca/answer/why-dont-you-make-the-chocolate-twisted-icecream-cones-anymore/





$C: One sec
$C: Thats why your dad spent hours roaming the hospital halls after you were born.
$C: Why do I get this, but also not get this at the same time
$C: /r/AntiJokes  
$C: Have you ever had a dream, EwokStomper, that you were so sure was real? What if you were unable to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?
$C:  **Greetings from Mexico**!  
$C: That joke gave me a twinge of sciatica.
$C: It's the only way I get any exercise. 
$C: It happens when you read one too. 
$C: Lol
$C: I just got up and walked around a little bit.
$C: /r/3amjokes
$C: I had to get up, walk around, buy some McDonald's fries, and take a selfie.
$C: Thanks for making me laugh :)
$C: You ever smell a smelly smell so smelly you have to get up and smell around a bit to find it?
$C: Might improve your posture. 
$C: It's like stubbing your toe.
$C: You would hate my dad.
$C: I haven't sat down yet
$C: Are you sure you're not just stomping ewoks?
$C: I also had to unhide a comment to do this.
$C: wow what a great play by play of that fascinating chain of events have you thought about writing a novel?
$C: Exactly what I did haha 
$C: I mean, that was the point.  But then she was all like, "I'm pregnant!".
$C: All these bad jokes are making me grimace.
$C: Then come back. It was a delightful pun and I'd like to hear more.
$C: Is this Baby Shark
$C: Yeah but what does that make me since Im posting post imposter poster poster?
$C: I'm not your alt.
$C: enthicaly
$C: They literally *secreted* the poster. It was very strange.
$C: hmmm tell me more...

&#x200B;
$C: secretions
$C: secretely hung
$C: Secretely hung
$C: Well, that is your subjective view on it 
$C: The other user is an advertising intern, check her history, who replied to EVERY SINGLE child post insulting them for being suspicious of the genuine nature of this post.
$C: Ohh another user? Well that 100% confirms that it must be legit. Pitchforks away guys. 
$C: /r/nothingeverhappens
$C: People in the thread both commented on how they were handsome and how they were happy to see Asians in advertisements, so I guess maybe yoy’re wrong.
$C: They have some hands. 
$C: I don't know about the left one but I wo6ld definetly bang the right one. No homo.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Are you joking? McDonald's advertises non-stop, they even have jingles that many people would instantly recognize. The very fact that you know the phrase "I'm loving it" is proof. 
$C: Yeah, McDonalds is pretty ubiquitous.. it’s like when I see adverts for YouTube -you mean that globally recognised thing that basically everyone uses?
$C: Just off the top of my head, the Uber eats driver playing with the Oculus rift with the food in the foreground of the photo, clearly an advertisement. Also the charismatic British drive thru worker, clearly an ad. And also this, clearly an ad.
$C: You mean the stuff about them killing people? Definitely ads. 
$C: They're probably just at home in front of a green screen.
$C: https://twitter.com/Jevholution/status/1036415320959930368
$C: This was on twitter on the guy in the picture's account. He's not lying. He's just not giving credit. I don't have the link though.
$C: OP did not imply that he did this
$C: The hell are you on about?
$C: http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/9cmazx/they_noticed_there_was_a_blank_wall_at_mcdonalds/e5btzlf
$C: /r/nothingeverhappens 
$C: I put these two (well, really these four) through facial recognition software and found them not to be the same people in the poster. 
$C: This is McDonalds ad team in action. 
$C: Also, there are no other labels of other companies. 
$C: So what you're saying is that the reddit post is the real McDonald's ad
$C: Wait, I do want fries with my order! 
$C: They have to be marketing students... 
$C: And it's yellow unlikw the other circles 
$C: It's definitely on brand.  The only thing they could do to improve it, is show vignettes where they also work there, and are going to school at the same time.
$C: >  for no reason

Well, it mimics the same circles used in the other, legit, posters that they briefly showed earlier.
$C: It's like those captchas, which circle had fries in it?
$C: I know people are probably joking but I'll be damned if they don't get a cushy job in marketing after this. 
$C: And the fries container is grabbed incorrectly backwards so you can see the mcd logo. 
$C: The important part is that the circle that highlights the fries is in a different colour.
$C: 100% this 
$C: and ***BOKEH***
$C: I suspect, though, that the golden arches in the corner don't actually match McDonald's current style guide...

[Yup.](https://www.brandebook.com/images/jdgallery/1276/McDonalds_Master_Brand_Logo_Artwork_Directory-0010-BrandEBook.com.jpg)
$C: I thot it was a hair on my screen. Been blowing on my phone for hours. 
$C: Makes me wonder if they or the photographer are graphic design majors
$C: Huge profit margin for fries too! Up selling all the way. 
$C: And there’s a trash can on the left
$C: Relevant user name?
$C: The bright colored yellow circle on the fries is a nice subliminal eye wink.

Now I want their delicious golden yellow fries. 

Damn you, you filthy magnificent amateurs.

$C: I kinda feel like having some fries right now..
$C: They are not randomly dotted, black is for a bad amount of mcdonalds, white is for a good amount of mcdonalds.
$C: The other posters in the restaurant have the same dotted circles.

https://youtu.be/0rJHC6nY4F8?t=43
$C: Honeslty, these guys could probably sell the image to mcs for decent coin.
$C: Also symbolic of intelligence, either suggesting to the viewer that smart people also choose to eat at McDonald's, and that McDonald's is a smart decision.
$C: Like it was made to reach reddit front page or something...
$C: Thats because McDonalds put it there.
$C: What kind of pointers?
$C: It's not uncommon for household-name brands to partially obscure or use only part of their logo these days.

They know viewers' brains will "auto-complete" and it's a way of striking a familiar or casual tone and a contemporary aesthetic.

Just yesterday, I saw a billboard design that only included the top half of their logo.

The branding for the french fry container is more than the logo. It's also the color and design of the container. More than enough is visible for customer recognition.
$C: It's still very clearly McDonald's fries, there's no way anyone would think otherwise. Not covering it would make it seem unnatural. The photo needs to look candid, not staged.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I think it screams, "customers first!" 
$C: I would also argue that the trash can would be clone stamped out. 
$C: can I get a nitpick too?
$C: Also, as someone who’s been on these kind of shoots, that bin...never would have been included in final image
$C: Good eye
$C: Have you already forgotten that this is **not** a McDonald's ad? These two guys made it themselves and hung it in the restaurant.  
$C: Middle finger to the M perhaps?
$C: it is Mcdicks testing brand awareness - more and more willl be covered in future ads until people ask "what restaurant is that from?"
$C: It's a poster inside a McDonald's. There's no question what brand of fries they are.
$C: This is why he’s sitting in McD’s designing stuff.   Not working for them.
$C: A McDonald's ad in the restraunt itself and with a logo on the bottom right. 'tis ok.
$C: If it's in store display images like this. Partial is fine. It connects with the customers. 

If it's print or video. Can't cover up any portion. Everything gets white glove treatments. (Very few exceptions)


Source: too many years in advertising
$C: Nah, we're talking about a Millennial world now. The only advertisements that are respected are ones that are as obscured ***or*** as blatantly overt as possible. This little artwork is already obviously an advertisement, so throwing in obvious focus on the symbols would just make it tacky. 
$C: The fact that they're already *in* a McDonalds probably negates the need to show the full logo.
$C: [deleted]
$C: You must have missed the big yellow “M” with “I’m lovin’ it” right below it in the bottom right corner
$C: My specific guess would be that they’re Filipino.
$C: And you would be wrong for the guy on the right.
$C: Filipino’s maybe?
$C: That's the standard around here
$C: Ambiguous races to white Americans
$C: To be fair, Filipinos are some of the most mixed peoples racially - probably in the top 10 or at least 20 globally.

You've got American, Japanese, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, African, Malay, and Aboriginal Austronesian forming large sections of their genetic pool.  Sure, you can find tremendous genetic mixing almost anywhere in the modern world, but very few places represent such a geographically wide range of significant and distinct genetic inputs.

That makes them more likely to be be racially "ambiguous".  

That said I agree these two are most likely Filipino.
$C: FAF, yo
$C: So ... you are at least half right.
$C: So, Pulp Fiction is a great movie...
$C: It's a line from *Pulp Fiction*. Since they use the metric system and wouldn't know what a pound is, Europe calls "A Quarter-Pounder w/ Cheese" a *Royale w/ cheese*. They were specifically talking about Amsterdam. I was in Amsterdam a few months ago and did check a McDonald's, they call it a quarter-pounder. I don't know about the rest of Europe or if it's always been that way.

edit: my mistake, they talk about Paris and Amsterdam in that scene, but he says that its called a Royal w/ cheese in Paris. I havent been to any McDonalds in Paris so i cant comment much on that. But Amsterdam called it a Quarter-pounder
$C: In countries that use the metric system, it's what you know as the Quarter Pounder.
$C: Also known as a Quarter Pounder with Cheese
$C: Yes. We have it in Poland. It’s called McRoyal. We have metric system, so nobody would know what a quarter pounder is. 
$C: In Germany there is a royal cheese which is basically a quaterpounder sized cheeseburger
$C: Its a Quarter Pounder its a reference to Pulp Fiction ( John Travolta's character has a conversation with Samual L Jackson's character about food names in other countries)
$C: When I was in Paris I had the Royale with Cheese. 

I bought it, knowing fully well that it was just a quarter pounder with cheese, but for some reason my mind made it out to be something mind blowing.

Ate it.

Just a quarter pounder with cheese.

$C: Pulp Fiction 
$C: McRoyale is a Europe/Middle East McDonald's thing, I've never seen it in the US
$C: A battle royale with cheese, coming soon to your local McDonalds.
$C: It's a real burger in France, not just a Pulp Fiction reference. Pulp Fiction referenced the real burger.
$C: Despacito is just the start of a doujin stop
$C: Nope, OP is fat
$C: That counts as fit for everyone, because they are fit.

Also how do you know that guy is American? 
$C: For OP, not fat = fit
$C: Sometimes, but definitely not always.  There are a huge number of ads where the person is holding a burger and hasn't taken a single bite yet.
$C: I thought they always did super diverse ads for these sorts of things. Never noticed though. Might vary by area though as I live in a very Asian area.
$C: A lot of what they do is not just create pure fake content, but use a bunch of accounts to make sure posts related to them do well, seem well received, etc, posts negative to them don't, create/support dissent on posts about competitors, etc.

In addition to spreading visibility etc like a normal ad, this also has a feedback effect on a site like reddit, where people associate posts about that company/gov with easy karma and a positive reception, artificially creating the sense that "everyone likes _________”.
$C: No way McDonalds would put up their own video saying they aren't representing a minority enough.
$C: I've seen no proof yet. Similar stunts have been done before with art galleries, high way signs, etc. 
$C: Or, this is just standard McDonalds marketing and OP is farming karma
$C: http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/9cmazx/they_noticed_there_was_a_blank_wall_at_mcdonalds/e5btzlf
$C: Why does everything have to be marketing?

I get people being skeptical but every time something popular pops up, but a ton of redditors always call out that it's definitely either marketing or a PR stunt. Most of the time it's actually not one.
$C: Definitely or supposedly?
$C: You mean there AREN'T horny single women in my area looking for sex, no credit card required?
$C: [Relevant](https://youtu.be/FScIOG-2Or0)
$C: >No way, people always walk into restaurants with giant posters and put them on the wall unnoticed. 

I feel like the unusual aspect is what makes it a prank, so I'm not really following your train of logic here.  
$C: Creating a "making of this prank" video that itself is part of the campaign seemed sophisticated to me. But then again, marketers do dedicate their lives to this stuff, and there's good money in it...
$C: Said \~$90 in the YT video.

$C: It’s not though https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0rJHC6nY4F8&feature=youtu.be
$C: Do you see any stains on this shirt?
$C: Where does it say they’re employees?
$C: Oh it did. It shot up to the #1 spot with 40k upvotes in less than an hour, meaning it got upvoted at near record speed. I guess that just goes to show the unwavering grass-roots dedication the average redditor has to McDonalds!
$C: Reddit and cynicism. Name a better duo
$C: Bro, reddit upvotes are very weird and people commenting too.

My first /r/all post was of a mcd worker helping a disabled guy. It happened in my town, and the local paper reposted The photo some random person took. My post skyrocket, as well as the accusations of being a shill, or hailcorporate. I don't even have a throwaway, nevertheless a upvote army.

This year I've got to #1 with a video of a naked guy entering a bank agency... I think I'm getting better.
$C: I didn’t get paid 
$C: [Source](https://youtu.be/0rJHC6nY4F8)
$C: If I were to go full conspiracy, I would say that there is a comment down somewhere saying "give those men a job" or something similar. And in a few days we see a new "post" saying how their reddit fame allowed them to land a contract with McDo...

People love stories that end well and it gives a good/human/in touch with the young people of reddit dimension to the company...
$C: [deleted]
$C: Hahaha! I was a professional graphic designer for years. This is so true.
$C: You *will* be a model. 
$C: Don't let your dreams be dreams. 
$C: Yes, but that would be just pants.
$C: Maybe not a good model, but a model nonetheless. I'll reserve judgement until seeing how you work your stuff.
$C: Although if you don't have a six pack, be prepared to get sued by Calvin Klein for tarnishing their image.
$C: Interesting, you don’t see McDonalds advertisements? Larger corporations advertise all the time. They put billions per year inter advertising, and maybe, just maybe, they know more about it than you.
$C: [gorilla marketing](https://i.imgur.com/OQS5IrY.jpg)
$C: I understand your conspiracy theory. I am simply commenting on the amateurish quality of the product placement in the supposed homemade poster. I'm sorry you thought my comment was made to elicit any sort of response, be it discussion or explanation, of the original post. 
$C: Haha yeah right go back to /r/hailcorporate

I'm going to go to the quad of my elite university with my diverse friend group and share a delicious and healthy meal of a classic McDonald's Big Mac (now with only 500 calories) and enjoy a protein and calcium packed (hand churned) strawberry shake! Have you tried McDonald's new southwest chicken salad yet? My bodybuilding friend says it's a must for cutting! I have a sport's practice to get to. *Later*
$C: Yeah, there was a definite shift a few years back. There's all sorts of astroturfing on this site these days.
Ànd a lot of users, especially the younger ones (I imagine at least. Teens.) don't want to go against a circlejerk and get downvoted so they just agree.

You see people rant and rave over something, then turn on it because others are doing the same. Elon Musk is a good example right now. He said a couple of dumb things on Twitter, so now he's not "cool" anymore. That dataisbeautiful post really shows it. I would be most people dont even know what he said, but still speak negatively anyway.

It's really interesting, watching how people just go along with what the narrative is in any topic.
$C: Would it surprise you to learn that on a website where people can talk about anything, some of them will talk about products that exist? Particularly products that they themselves make use of?
$C: May I suggest looking up the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon?
$C: Well yeah. The core thing is that companies are part of peoples lives, so eventually there's always going to be comedy or interesting content that relates to those companies, like putting up a poster. Reddit advertises for tons of brands, because these brands are part of peoples lives, and therefore ends up being a part of the content creation. They couldn't do this in a mom n pop shop, so if it wasn't some fast food place, they probably couldn't do this at all. 
$C: Okay hear me out though

Some people don't care as long as it's funny/entertaining
$C: To be fair, though they were eating there in the first place to notice, their point in doing this whole thing was that none of McDonald's in-store advertisements featured Asians at all. So really it was kind of a knock on Mcdonald's.
$C: Interestingly enough (well, for me, anyway) they advertise all the way down to local, Instagram-type influencers. 

Last summer we’d see lots of ads by X person talking about whatever sandwich or drink. It would usually be someone with a pretty good size following (20k and up) but this type of ad stuff is still a newish thing and does surprisingly well.
$C: yeah, because im suuuure Mcdonalds is missing out on the Reddit market
$C: I dont give a crap! I love my Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese!^^TM

$C: Maybe that’s because they put billions into their press?
$C: Use as headshots or proof of modeling for a bigger gig.
$C: Next step order at the counter and point out that you are actually the model in their poster. Agree to autographing it.
$C: The workers would know better, where are you going to find food at McDonalds?
$C: I think it’s McDonald’s advertising on Reddit. 
$C: Hail Corporate 
$C: Does Mcdonalds really need advertising outside of new product launches?There’s two type of people in this world: those who eat McDonald’s and those who are grossed out by it. Then there’s me who only goes there for fries and hot coffee.

E: McDonald has the best hot coffee around for a fucking dollar and anyone who disagrees can honestly meet me outside.
$C: 3. Guys with some disposable income having a bit of a laugh. 
$C: I’m pretty sure that they don’t work for McDonald’s. The guy on the right has a YouTube channel and he posted a [video on how they did it](https://youtu.be/0rJHC6nY4F8)!
$C: 2 is probably true, and there's nothing wrong with that. 
$C: 2 is a solid guess.
$C: i would say #2! i know this guys! they're film students from graduate school lol
$C: McDonalds marketing dept on some next level shit 
$C: It is
$C: Now I want a big Mac.
$C: Totally. 
$C: Would've been taken down in hours.
$C: Omg everything isn't an ad. MCDONALD'S DOESNT NEED ADS ITS MCDONALD'S
$C: Stop spamming your stupid subreddit everywhere. Your profile is full of you saying "This is /r/next....level shit right here."
$C: To each their own. I think the joke that keeps on giving has more value.
$C: r/DIY is the worst at this. You could share a 50 image step-by-step album about the treehouse you built for your kids and the comments would be nothing but “Uhh yeah that’s a fall hazard so your kids are gonna die” and “How exactly is my friend in a wheelchair supposed to use this? Epic Fail.”
$C: I already knew that.
$C: We want to ask questions not get answers!

What do we want?

When do we want it?
$C: Reddit loves answers in the comments. It's just going through extra effort like reading articles and following links that we don't like.
$C: Nah, we don't like to think we already know.  We like to think we're figuring it all out.  Just like we did with the Boston marathon bomber.
$C: T-rex doesn't want to be fed, he wants to repost.
$C: Too real
$C: To be fair it takes a relatively high IQ to understand Rick and Morty.
$C: We know how to use commas where a semicolon or period should go.
$C: He bought a McDs shirt from a thrift store and had a walkie talkie. All he needed was a clipboard and a reflective vest and he could get into the oval office
$C: watch the video! they got quick hands.
$C: A reflective jacket and a toolbox will get you to more places than you think.
$C: We did it Reddit!
$C: >video ready to roll-out the same day they made their reddit post

I think you're mixing up cause and effect, dude.

He finally finished editing the video and posted about it on Twitter. It started going viral, someone saw it and posted it to Reddit. Then it went even more viral.

Not everything is a deep state conspiracy, sometimes cool people do cool things and are recognized for it.
$C: Aah I completely forgot about snackwraps are they ever bringing those back.
$C: oh sorry hahaha. it's not a good enough reason for anyone to believe me, but while i was typing it up here i was starting to wonder why i've never seen the video. I'm thinking they either took the video down or I just can't find it among the hundreds of Groupon skydiving videos on YouTube. Both are likely... He's an independent director and is very careful about what videos are online with his name. 
$C: Regardless, an advertisement is an advertisement, whether or not they were paid for it.

It's like you and a buddy sneaking into McDonald's and working a shift absolutely for free, then laughing about it like "Hey man, we pranked them so hard! They totally thought we worked there and we make so many burgers. It was great!"

Either way, this post is [native advertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_advertising)
$C: DONE. NOW WHAT. 
$C: Hey.Those are my pitchforks
$C: You’re right, I’m just an idiot with a bad sense humor.
$C: They do give a fuck. They just don’t suprervise ever use of the machine.
$C: I've had a hard time with this once in the past but maybe it was just an overzealous manager or something. Thanks for the response!
$C: Username does not check out. Lol.
$C: Wow, I bet McDonalds is totally surprised by all this free advertising XD so random1!!!!!!!
$C: >he’s already been contacted by radio stations, buzzfeed, bbc, etc.!!! lol

On a Sunday/Federal holiday?  I bet.
$C: buzzfeed lol everyone knows they pay really well lol
$C: possible to be wholesome and funny. All these dudes did was free marketing for a mega corporation. "look at me I'm an unpaid model, an unpaid photographer, and an unpaid graphic designer
$C: What? No fb link? 
$C: I mean, it's 1 picture, I can't Make a complete assessment on just that. 
$C: And creepy
$C: oh yeah! it was just a funny intro lol not was i was expecting 
$C: Which houston location? Im a houston local and I want to go.
$C: Cool!  I’d like to see!  What area of town?  
$C: Cool comment, you must be really interesting to talk to, and not a basic bitch that upvotes McDonald’s ads
$C: Just a guerilla marketing campaign promoted by a professional advertising reddit account
$C: How’s the advertising internship going?
$C: Just a silly college prank! (that costs at least 85$ and hours of planing execution, editing, and Reddit  brand management by an ad intern friend.
$C: KILL THE PURPLE BEAST!
$C: When I was a kid, nothing made me love McDonalds like the two dudes with cheeseburgers for heads
$C: robble robble!
$C: Crash the next executive meeting at Netflix. Act like you belong, then casually say "we should show an ad when users click 'skip intro'."

Watch the room erupt in bonuses.
$C: Yes I saw it with MoviePass, America's Largest Theater Network. Enjoy 3 Movies a month for just $9.95.
$C: Ba da bop ba baa I’m lovin’ it!
$C: How much karma would I need before a company was interested in my account? Hypothetically speaking, of course...
$C: Shit, I've posted way too many defamatory comments and slurs, now I'm never gonna get that ad money. So you guys know it's real when I say the new, improved double quarter pounder with cheese is fucking delicious.
$C: Just look at how much goes into style guides. McDonald's is number 31 if you are interested https://www.freelancer.com/community/articles/one-hundred-style-guides-you-should-see-before-designing-yours
$C: It’s insane to think that a post at a 50% voting ratio would sit at the front page without some kind of vote manipulation. Most posts on the front page (if not all) are > 90%
$C: The supervisor or MOD doesnt but also sure as shit wouldnt want to lose their job over letting a couple of college kids mounting an unapproved poster on the wall and not saying "hey quit" 
$C: Can confirm. When I was a Taco Bell employee, I did not get paid enough to care about two guys putting up what appears to be a posted from HQ. I probably would have questioned something wildly out of place... But this? Please, go right ahead, it means I won't have to hang that poster later.
$C: Totally Radical Bro! Let's go avoid drugs together bruh!
$C: Just thinking about it purely from a logistics standpoint makes this unbelievable; the claim being that these guys walk into a macdonalds (of which most locations are fairly busy) with a huge poster, and somehow manage to pin it to the wall unnoticed, unless they somehow pulled off being contractors who had the job.

Seems more likely that they asked to do this to take the picture, or this was an assignment in their marketing course at uni. I just don't buy this one
$C: The same however, cannot be said about the ice cream machine
$C: I mean I could see there being issues if there was a tiny dickbutt or less than obvious troll somewhere... but it's pretty normal
$C: I bet no one has even noticed its there. 
$C: How does this only promote one location? You think that people only want to go to the franchise location they see in the commercial?
$C: It happens all the time. Whoever put it up either misinterpreted instructions or went rogue, I imagine it's more likely the latter. Grads aren't losing out on work because there was never any intention to hire out in these situations.
$C: They don’t ask 
$C: They've been getting by without good employees for years. 
$C: Maybe they follow the strategy "giving away the oil lamps but selling the oil" 
$C: I understood some of the words in that sentence
$C: They didn't drill holes. You know tape exists, right? Oh shit, could this be advertising for command strips, too?
$C: ..i'll show you taking this \*too\* seriously.
$C: ..i'll show you taking this \*too\* seriously again.
$C: After working for Starbucks on and off for 10 years and seeing people get fired for less, you bet your ass i would at least mention it to my manager, and if i was a supervisor or anyone with any responsibility passed a line worker that shit would have been off that afternoon. Someone elses joke isnt worth my paycheck, and if you think im being unfun in some way or no way someone would get written up or fired for this youre dead wrong. 
$C: ... I recognised myself a bit in this and eh, I'm in the process of joining the military. 
$C: When you recognise the poster kids.  
   
*double tap*
$C: So when you say you want "rules to be upheld" you mean meaningless regulations and not, say, the Geneva Conventions. Good to know.
$C: Hope not too much of our military is made up of failed food industry workers.   It would explain some things though. 
$C: Best worst 4 years of my life.

$C: You can do anything if you carry a clipboard and act like you belong. 

Source: Carried a clipboard into Burger King and stole a table during lunch rush. 
$C: Isn't that the point?
$C: If you work at McDonald’s, you make $8/hour and spend your days dealing with idiots who want to see the manager. Do you give a flying fuck who the guy in McDonald’s gear putting up a McDonald’s poster is?
$C: Most people don't question authority which is what makes this a nice social experiment that re-affirms this sort of behavior.

Of course if you were paying me minimum wage I wouldn't give a shit either even if I knew it was fake.
$C: 15 seconds in and I'm annoyed that this random chick is shit-talking someone for doing their job and cleaning.
$C: I think you’re having a stroke.
$C: he drives a chevrolet movie theater
$C: I have no idea about the law, but it would probably be bad PR if they did sue over this. Most people probably see this as a lighthearted joke, so a lawsuit would seem like a harsh overreaction I would think. 
$C: It's on the first comment now :)
$C: I'm sure the company that runs Superbowl ads is paying a small YouTube channel to make videos.
$C: Lol do you actually believe McDonalds would pay two kids who have 300 subscribers to make this video?
$C: in case someone called him out? The goal was to put up a poster, not to act like a manager. He put that on in case he needed it
$C: It's almost like the whole thing is just a paid-for stunt for viral marketing by McDonald's.
$C: An army of fake Reddit accounts paid for by MD probably gave it a first push towards the front page though. 
$C: It looks like it was printed on foam core, so yes 
$C: Did you watch the video? He literally calls out McDonalds for the lack of diversity in their posters which is the reason he put up the poster of a couple of Asian dudes in the first place.

Anyone who thinks McDonalds is responsible for this isn't being logical
$C: What does that prove?
$C: Ir proves nothing really though 
$C: [deleted]
$C: [removed]
$C: Crazier shit happens in the world than what he’s talking about  
$C: Dude has a video on how he got it on the wall. It was pretty slick actually.

Although the motivations we're a little too SJW for me. Like I don't go everywhere expecting black people to be represented. There's too many god damn ethnicities to expect everywhere to cater to your identity for marketing reasons. Like who gives a shit? Honestly?!

$C: Obvious troll is obvious. 
$C: Australian reporters get  their stories from /r/all
$C: Truth.  See: Sandy Hook.
$C: > It's a poster so not that expensive,

You realize that poster probably costs close to or over $100, right?
$C: What are these guys winning exactly?
$C: You don’t think that one of the most highly regarded marketing departments in the corporate world could come up with a “viral”  reddit post?
$C: You don't think McDonald's is smarter than these two random dudes?
$C: They are not making any money off it.
$C: They aren't making (or trying to make) any money out of it or purporting to adopt the mark as their own, or (particularly) disparaging or damaging the brand associated with the mark, - not really many ways for McDs to come at them on a trademark front given that.
$C: They are McDs marketing team.
$C: Can you photoshop the video they posted, too?
$C: Yes. So stupid. Who can be a fan of a restaurant?
Who would want them to stay open?
So stupid. 
$C: McDonald’s is already fresh on your mind when you see this ad because you’re fucking inside one. 
$C: It’s a McDonald’s. 99.9999% of their consumer base are recurring customers that couldn’t give a fraction of a fuck what the interior is. 
$C: The channel has already gotten publicity from this post. It's an investment to grow the channel. It's not like they can't make more videos either.
$C: [Here.](https://youtu.be/0rJHC6nY4F8)
$C: I don't understand the whole hail corporate thing. Makes no sense.  
$C: That's what you think.
$C: Right, the whole point of the post is to make it seem like it's some creative funny shit two guys made up. McDonald's has had a lot of paid ads on Reddit this past week. The timing is not coincidental. On top of that, the dots on the pic are McDonald's work. A video of them doing this  was just good looking ahead because it looks so blatantly like an ad. And gotta think bigger - they have two 18-25 dudes doing this, right at the start of college semester, multicultural - it screams a McD ad. You throw this shit on to Reddit and guaranteed to go viral, and hit that 18-25 male demo that probably is a decent chunk of Reddit. After that, the Instagram hounds picked it up from Reddit and it spread like wild fire there, on accounts like FuckJerry. It's really somewhat gold guerilla marketing. They should've paid for this shit or at least made it known.

$C: Hahaha. It’s probably exactly what you think. 

Well these two went out of their way to make a full size promotional advertisement. A pretty damn good one. Apparently snuck it into the McDonald’s, hung it up and it’s been there since. 
I mean it’s not the greatest prank of all time but subtlety clever and harmless. 
$C: Edit: off your self
$C: Want to impress me? Dirty that Ice cream machine.
$C: This. In my brief stint more than several years ago I learned that it was "down" usually for the night shift because it had already been cleaned and I guess they didn't want to dirty it, or maybe also because then they'd be understaffed since at night the cashier would be taking orders, gathering food orders, but also making the shakes ice cream which slows things down a lot. It is pretty much the dumbest thing because people want ice cream and shakes as late night snacks, local joints close earlish, and it's just missing out on profit. Try burger king, they are slow as fuck but in my experience they aren't down as much late night.
$C: Look, where's my fuckin ice cream?!
$C: Why the hell didn't they just roll out a pair of ice cream machines then?  This is a business, yah?
$C: Who cares!!!!! CLEAN IT. That why we go there. Oh pleeeeez we luv our ice creams 😃
$C: What made it smell bad? I worked at Wendy's all through highschool and cleaned our frosty machines every night and they never had a foul odor that I recall. 
$C: My first job (1965) was scooping ice cream at a Baskin-Robbins. Every day I went home smelling like sour milk. I swear I had to shower twice as long just to get rid of the smell.
$C: You want to smell something gross? Get a job at the Hershey chocolate plant and smell milk chocolate paste being made. It smells like straight up baby vomit.
$C: It literally smells like puke
$C: I used to work at McDonald’s 13 years ago for a year and I never once had to clean the machine. I remember filling it with that heavy ass cream milk or whatever tf they called it. 
$C: Of course if you haven't cleaned it in 20 years it will smell bad.
$C: I clean mine onece a week and it doesn't smell the slightest bit how long did you wait to clean it?
$C: Same here working at cold stone. Smells like baby throw up 
$C: Or chili sauce
$C: Check your pm
$C: Wanna impress me? Send nudes of ice cream.
$C: So the machine is a stickler about being cleaned (even if half the alarms are false)?

This somehow makes me feel better about it.
$C: So weird, I worked at Mcdonald’s 13 years ago and our ice cream machine wasn’t like that at all. Maybe we had a different model but I never once cleaned that machine. I worked every shift and every position (cash, drive thru, kitchen) and I was there over a year. I would even pick up shifts at the nearby store when they were short staffed. 

Our machine would be down sometimes but only because the cream wasn’t churned enough so it would come out liquid. I actually got into a big argument with a guest when she ordered 2 reg McFlurries and one Lg. It was dinner rush so I pressed the “large” button but it didn’t register on the touch screen since I was rushing and she got the default regular size on all 3. My runner, who was my classmate and supervisor, hands her all the 3 McFlurries and she says she ordered one large. He throws it out and guess what? Ice cream machine is down. All hell breaks loose.
$C: damn, really? My manager always took about 4 hours and she did it once a week. Pretty sure she was only scheduled to do it hat often, too.
$C: It’s so weird for McDonald’s to operate this way. For the past 20-30 years the ice cream/milkshake machine has been an issue. Why can’t they get a better machine? I’ve never heard of places like Dairy Queen having their machine down...
$C: I quit mcdicks about a year and a half ago.  We had the same machine.  No matter how we timed it, it would go into a heat cycle and lock down at the worst time.  

&#x200B;

Our maintenance guy was a fucking idiot who broke it every other week too though and he couldn't be fired because he was mostly deaf and threatened to sue if they did.  I don't understand how he bent the steel cylindrical spiral thing in the center but he did.  And then he overfilled it and the machine locked itself so badly we had to get a repair man, who kept shouting at the same maintenance guy who tried to butt in and tell HIM what to do.  Oh my god it was a nightmare with him.  Then he broke the plastic door on the front from overtightening the bolts- TWICE in a row.  New one came in, instantly broken.  He somehow split the hose for the chocolate flavor and didn't tell anyone even though his shirt was soaked with syrup on his way out (that wasn't fun to clean up and wasn't fun when it was spraying all over).  Ants got into it and he still wanted to reuse the mix \[we said FUCK NO on that\]

also the store ghost led to the shake machine turning on overnight when nobody was there and DUMPED everything on the floor.  Was jelly by the time the store opened and the machine was locked out again and grinding
$C: Why the hell didn't they just roll out a pair of ice cream machines then?  This is a business, yah?
$C: Sounds like any copy machine I've ever used
$C: This post is the absolute top tier of exaggeration.

Yes, the machine can "lockout". << correct term

Yes, it is finicky, to a point.

But to say you were taking it apart 2-3x times a day (if you are referring the Taylor Freezers version), then all i can say is that I'm sorry that your work for an Owner that won't make the service call.


$C: But dairy Queen isn't open at 2am when the drunk and high people need ice cream. Think of the intoxicated!
$C: I went there once and their ice cream machine was down too, it was a sad day. Then again ice cream thirty minutes before closing time is an iffy proposition anyway.
$C: Are you guys talking the mcflurry? Or is there some other kind of ice cream at mcdonalds we don't get outside of the US?

Because I've never had an issue getting a mcflurry at any place I've been.
$C: Shamrock Shakes? They're cool, but I don't really like mint flavour in anything other than a mint.
$C: \*Milkshook. That was another time.
$C: Sure you have to wipe down the external parts of the machine but for the cleaning cycle you just fill the reservoirs up with shake/sundae mix and press a button. 

It will then heat the mixture up to about 70 degrees Celsius and it cleans itself. It just cycles the hot (now sterile) mixture throughout the system. We do this at night also, usually starting around 2-3am. 

The real problem is the overheating. I’ve spoken to a couple of the engineers that come out to fix it and they say the same thing - the cooling system is shit. It takes a lot of energy to cool all that liquid quickly and a lot of that energy is converted to heat. We had to buy a stand-alone A/C unit just to blast at the shake machine this summer. 

A new machine costs £26,000 so it makes financial sense to just pay a contractor to fix it every time... even if that’s 4 times a week. 

It’s all about money money money with places like that. Every hour the computer updates itself with all the metrics and stats of the store. If they’re not making enough money they will start sending people home just to save that £5-9 for that hour. It’s crazy, but they really don’t give a shit about what you want. They want your money and it’s easier to get if you’re in the store at the counter. 
$C: Not to get all grandpaey but it does seem like people have gotten more entitled since the smart phone era
$C: This if I remember a guest who was a PITA then I don't feel bad for him but I will do my best for all guests who are not shitty like I've Chased a car out to the traffic light who forgot part of there order 
$C: Should probably be cleaning it more often. At in n out we disassembled/reassembled and sanitized daily
$C: Unpaid work/overtime is illegal here in the USA. Did it without knowing for 6 YEARS! I armed my self with knowledge of California labor laws and took my case to HR. Long story short, they had to pay me for all the unpaid time. If this is happening to anyone I suggest you look into your states labor laws and get informed. Also, always keep a paper trail! Keep all those check stubs, that information could be vital down the road. 
$C: How are the extra hours cut? 100% sure that's illegal, but assuming difficult to get enforced as a worker. Wondering if you could track it over time and eventually go so small claims court when it would be valuable to spend the effort doing so?
$C: Or their McDonald's actually has decent scheduling for their cleaning. I know that the owner of the franchise near me got so many hate messages that he completely rescheduled the cleanings and there hasn't been any issues since. 
$C: I'm not proud of this, but I actually go to McDonald's a fuck ton.
$C: Nobody is bragging. People either over exaggerate the broken ice cream thing or live in shitty areas where a broken machine never gets fixed but in most places they aren't broken all of the time. 
$C: Oh yeah, based on what I'm reading here that thing is a massive pain in the ass to assemble and clean.
$C: I don't blame them, I hear that machine is a pain in the ass. Another poster says the thing takes like an hour.
$C: And you're already a double girl...
$C: Yeah, but it means I made a lot of people smile.

$C: 4 to be exact
$C: You can tell because they said it was a prank. (Is that what you’re going for?)
$C: I was kind of doing a bit, there. I guess it didn't hit, because somehow people thought I'd seriously advertise all that junk. It was comedy. Not great comedy.
$C: What about the one where the manager is beating the shit out of a customer and a titty pops out?
$C: Look puny human, once you become powerful enough the only way to gain more power is to secretly fund and run your own "opposition".

$C: [And he uploaded a video on youtube on how he did it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=0rJHC6nY4F8)
$C: I'm super convinced this is a viral marketing thing now. Or at least an attempt to get into marketing and advertising.

The video is just wholesome enough that it seems authentic but can't possibly look bad for McDonalds. The only other videos on his YT channel are "Cancun in 1 minute", "Marriot Marquis in 1 Minute" ("shot on the iPhone 6S") and "A Lot to Handle", a short film for a made-in-24-hours film competition also shot with the iPhone 6s.
$C: Even funnier is the “design coordinator” outfit he made so that no one looked twice when he put it up. That’s dedication to a prank. 
$C: But I already bought this pitchfork
$C: Because usually nobody cares about the credit. Gets buried to the ground in sections.
$C: But what if you’re also lying?  
It’s lies all the way down! 
$C: Who is this Opie guy that everybody is always yelling at on the front page and/or flirting with on the NSFW subs? I think we should leave Opie alone. He's had it hard enough for years.
$C: Stellar observation!
$C: Wouldn’t be surprised if one of them was graphic design
$C: Imagine if they did this with a whopper and a frosty 
$C: Also, it has the McDonald’s logo on it!
$C: The flat billed hat adds just the right touch of cool to the pic too!
$C: So it's a Tide ad?
$C: And the pendant of the necklace is hidden by the fries!
$C: The trash can in the picture is a no-no, however.
$C: Ah! Using Brand X in commerical photography unless it's for the product itself! Ingenious.
$C: They planned this out
$C: This is feeling more and more like a viral ad.
$C: I do dock point for slightly covering the "M" on the fry carton. 
$C: It’s almost as if it’s a real McDonalds ad on the internet disguised as a viral story. I want to believe...
$C: -
$C: Bingo, in every add (especially tailgating ads for trucks or hotdogs) every single item has to be turned around to not show the lable, or it is a blank blue tee-shirt or the logo of the vehicle is removed.

EVERY SINGLE TIME.
$C: Really, the only thing that would clue me in that this wasn't legit (and I doubt I'd even examine it closely enough to realize) is that the fries and the burger look like an actual real world example of Mcdonalds fries and a burger. They don't look like they've been arduously selected and prepared for hours for a single shot like in the commercials.
$C: I wish they were staying burger King shirts now.
$C: Clothes are clean... Might be a tide ad. 
$C: It's a Tide ad
$C: I agree, the logistics of hanging such a large picture should be the smoking gun. Not to mention a poster that size isn't cheap. Seems awfully expensive for just a prank that's so perfectly hung with out anyone noticing. It would be more believable if the rear has a quick adhesive to quickly put it up. I also imagine if they put a hole in the wall to properly hang this, it could constitute a charge for damaging private property. The last giveaway is the time, by now upper management has for sure seen it and the fact that it's not removed seems fishy. Even as simply as this poster not being secured properly and falls on a patron is grounds for a large lawsuit. In corporate McDonald's everything is standard. I want to believe this cute story but these items are hard to ignore.
$C: Ding ding 
$C: I 100% believe this. Ops history would say against that, but I don't care. Anyone can be bought out.
$C: “come on in” written like fucking “red rum” in The Shining
$C: The real McDonalds ad is the friends we made along the way
$C: Honestly, this may be some r/nothinghappens shit, but this would seem like exactly the sort of stuff they would fake these days. 
$C: These are called "redditvertisments".  

There was a 'funny' review recently of Chrysler's new 'emasculator' minivan.  

Turns out it was an ad that Chrysler paid comic Jim Gaffigan to do, and then they got us all on Reddit to watch it as a 'viral video'.  
$C: Bingo!
$C: So what you’re saying is r/nothingeverhappens and you’re repeating their name to make it an ad?
$C: Make those large fries!
$C: You do you. I'll take a double brick column, hold the onions.
$C: Nah, I’ll just have a bit of brick wall with mine.
$C: And a side order of um -- bricks as well?
$C: And a milkshake. Wait - nevermind. The milkshake machine only works in March.
$C: This whole post is probably some marketing project by a McDonald's intern anyway lol
$C: Who are they marketing them towards?
$C: And make the burger not look so small.
$C: Or McDonald's can just remake it themselves?? If they gave a shit? Which they probably don't? 
$C: > for decent coin.  

https://i.imgur.com/a2mXvDr.png
$C: Khajiit has mcdoubles...
$C: Just a bit
$C: I doubt McDonald's is going to buy an ad they already paid for.
$C: You mean... viral marketing?
$C: doesn't need to be made to make the front page, for a tiny fee they can forcefully put it on the front page anyways. Wonder why this post has 125,000 upvotes hmm
$C: Franchise owners can hang their own murals. I’ve seen it. 

And why repeat their brand for them? You a shill bro? 
$C: Guy posted it on twitter I wouldn’t say he’s doing this for karma 
$C: Don't kill the magic
$C: yep and it also makes it seem like they're not trying as hard. even though, in truth, it means they're trying harder lol.
$C: Making them think about the logo probably makes it stick in the mind a little more even. I remember reading that the best voice over people for ads are not the most recognizable voices but distinctive ones that you have to think about where you know it from. Because then the ad is on your mind more. Wish I could find the article or Reddit post, it was a few years ago
$C: [Absolutely](https://i.imgur.com/rWPw2Mo.jpg) [Right](https://i.imgur.com/Ds36SA7)
$C: Not only is it not uncommon, I’d say it is the hot trend right now in graphic design. If not, it’s just now on it’s way out. 

By hot I mean prolific, not critically-acclaimed. 
$C: Some lawyers here in Michigan do the same with their billboards, but you have to see their commercials regularly to understand 

So one of them I drive by is something like:

> yadda yadda. been in an accident? dead?

> dial 1-800-call-picture of large man

Not the best marketing with so many cord cutters
$C: Not to long ago, McDonald's did a advertising campaign with zero logos or brand name. Granted, that's not normal and it was widely seen as pretty ballsy, but it still shows that logos aren't everything.

$C: You guys are amazing
$C: But it's his middle finger!
$C: Like the shirt on the left... #adu ? inc... probably using Mc Donalds allure to promote something else without the cost of brand recognition. Piggybacking per say
$C: Not to mention it would break the illusion that we're looking at people walking in the street if they overdid the presentation of the food they're eating.
$C: Top half of the McDonald's M also looks like an M
$C: Yep. Look at Sports Illustrated covers. They ROUTINELY cover up part of their name with somebodies head or whatever. And that's their logo
$C: And it's in the fucking McDonalds as well lol
$C: Even the fries emoji 🍟 with no logo says McDonald's because of the color. [(Emoji appearance varies by platform.)](http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html)
$C: There are so many ways to hold a container of fries. I'm sure there's a way to make it look natural.
$C: also the photo is inside a McDonald's, so it's not like people will think it's Burger King fries.
$C: Not to mention the McDonalds logo in the corner and the fact that it’s in a McDonalds 
$C: I have worked with way too many 'brand managers' to agree with you. you're not wrong- it does look unnatural but the marketing person overseeing this photo shoot would definitely make them uncover the logo. that shit is there for a reason, whether it looks natural or not isn't important to them. 

The customer or redditor can nitpick the details, but the poster has already done its job by then. It got our attention and now we're thinking about mcdonalds products. The impression has been made and that's all they're going for. realism is just a bonus

[since this is inside the store it would be more about reinforcement than making initial impressions but the goal/method is pretty much the same thing]
$C: It doesn't matter, you don't cover your logo. Especially since this is the only item showing it. This is such a basic mistake, it's basically a spellcheck level mistake. That's also not how you hold a burger for ads. There's a trash can in frame for no reason as well.

The point is this ad actually looks unprofessional. It doesn't look,"fake real" enough. However, as a viral ad it works well. It has us sitting here discussing their dumbass fries and ad. So kudos for that. 
$C: Client would definitely want the full logo exposed and no amount of reasoning would convince otherwise. 
$C: I'm not a marketing guy but I do sometimes have a weird response to some aspects of design and advertising. 

In this case, the trash can in the lower left bugs the hell out of me. I do not think it would be included in a professional ad. Both its positioning in the frame and the fact that it introduces the concept of trash/waste and dirtiness seems bad to me.
$C: I’m willing to bet the guy holding the fries plays stand up base or guitar....It’s almost like he’s fretting. Lol
$C: See covered logo trick above.
$C: Nah, you wouldn't use the clone stamp here, the bricks are easily just grabbed and duplicated and skewed into place
$C: Yea, you won't be young forever so you should change your username now before it stops fitting.

:p
$C: Somehow it also adds to the authenticity. 
$C: i mean what defines an advertisement? its promoting mcdonalds products so i’d argue this is an ad, they just weren’t paid for it
$C: Damn they're good. 
$C: Unless this is just some viral ad made by McDonalds.
$C: no u
$C: > You must have missed...

Nope.

I said it was a nitpick. :)
$C: They are. When they entered McDonald's with the poster, one of the guys said something in Filipino (huwag mong idikit sa pader).
$C: That's what I thought too. 

Filipinos have a really diverse range of appearances thanks to the history of the island. 
$C: Can confirm. My gf from the ph recognized the shirt in the left.

Edit: I took a second look, that shirt says adulting. But I’m 90% sure she’s right.
$C: Then I know a lot of people who would be pleasantly surprised to hear that they are actually considered fit.

$C: I checked when i was in France ten years ago. It was a royale with cheese (*royale avec fromage*) there. 
$C: >They were specifically talking about Amsterdam.

No, they were talking about Paris, France.
$C: They were only talking about hash bars and beer in the cinemas in Amsterdam. Then Vincent says that you can buy beer in a MacDonald's in Paris and then he ask Jules "Do you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with cheese in Paris?"
$C: "and you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with cheese in Paris?"  Just watched the clip.  But in the scene Vincent mentions Amsterdam, Europe, Holland, and Paris, so I can see how you mixed it up.
$C: [Royal Cheese](http://mcdonalds.hr/ponuda/royal-cheese/?ref_id=6) in Croatia
$C: Quarter pounder is a quarter pounder.  People do know that a pound is roughly half a kilo.   Additionally, I'm English and the reason you use pounds ain't cos you got it from the Navaho, innnit?  (i.e. we use pounds here, too.  Albeit somewhat controversially on occassion.)
$C: Plenty of metric countries use quarter pounder.
$C: I can confirm that we have always (as far back as the 90's, at least) referred to it as a quarter pounder in the UK.
$C: We do use pounds in Germany, though. It's half a kg. McD just didn't want to serve us 125g of meat in our quarterpounders because they're cheap. That's why they're selling us Royals.
$C: That’s because they were talking about Paris, not Amsterdam. 
$C: Check out the big brain on u/Hat-of-sky
$C: Not all countries. In Canada we still have the quarter pounder. We also have the metric system. 
$C: No here in the Netherlands a Quarter Pounder is a Quarter Pounder. I think only in countries where they have trouble pronouncing it it's called differently. 
$C: Canada uses the metric system and it’s still called a quarter pounder 
$C: Fun fact:  A&W introduced a 1/3 lb. burger in the '80s to try and steal some thunder from McDonald's quarter pounder.  

In taste tests, customers preferred A&W’s burger.  It was also less expensive. Yet instead of leaping at the great value, customers snubbed it.  It flopped because Americans thought a 1/3 lb. burger was smaller than a 1/4 lb. burger...because 4 is more than 3.  
$C: Oh, thanks! I actually learned something new!
$C: Obviously, it's a little more than a tenth of a kilo.
$C: >In Germany there is a royal cheese which is ~~basically~~ a quaterpounder sized cheeseburger


$C: WHERE IS JOHN CONNOR?!
$C: Maybe the ingredients are fresher in Paris. 
$C: >because they are fit

Interesting what passes as fit nowadays

>Also how do you know that guy is American

I don't really go on reddit for valuable content because imo there are groups that curate important content much better, I come on it for either fandom, memes, or to browse something silly when I'm on the toilet.
$C: Just this. 
$C: I am a professional designer, I have never used dotted circles. Am I doing something wrong? :(
$C: Aww. That's the best thing I've heard today. 
$C: *flex*
$C: It doesn’t look professionally made. These are two guys who dorked out and posted it on Twitter. 

I don’t know who posted it here. But who made it didn’t do it for the corporation.

$C: How is elon musk astroturfing? Lol

He didnt just say dumb shit, he said very asshole shit. He deserves the hate over it
$C: > Yeah, there was a definite shift a few years back. 

That's true for every 'partially' moderated social media site. Astroturfing, at first, was done by small media groups and very commonly in highly unethical ways. When done 'right', it worked so unbelievably well that as an advertising firm, you'd be stupid not to do it. Eventually most of the social media platforms realized they were missing out on money and created advertising platforms that make it easier for this kind of advertising to occur, and in such a manner they get paid for it. 
$C: > Yeah, there was a definite shift a few years back.

IIRC,  this was a [watershed moment](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/6ql2tu/made_my_delivery_drivers_night_by_showing_him_vr/).

$C: 2012. That was when advertisers bought out reddit. Ellen Pao took the fall, redditors rejoiced thinking they won... Yet here we are. 
$C: you're telling me people change their opinion on others after they do controversial things!??
$C: I think there’s some truth in what you say. But with Musk recently I don’t think a lot of people went along with it because of the narrative. 

I liked his cars and entry into the domestic battery market. And the Space shit. Pretty cool. 

But then he called the British cave-diver a fucking paedophile. He insinuated (completely unsubstantiated) that he fucks children for pleasure. In front of hundreds of millions of people. Absolute cunt move. Written him off completely. 
$C: Nah, every mention of an existing product is clearly paid for by a corporation.
$C: What you said can be true, alongside native advertising also being true. It's a thing. Companies hire and aspire for it now. Like it or not.

That's actually the point, where we can't tell when a post is legit or not. That's why it's called native advertising.
$C: Because, quite often, these threads are started by people that are paid agents for said product being talked about. 
$C: Oh ... I know. Plenty of people go out of their way specifically to get marketed and advertised to. My comment is directed at those people who would rather not have their lives inundated in ads and targeted marketing campaigns. 
$C: Marketing is far more complicated than you just made it out to be. 
$C: Internet advertising? Most companies advertise online, that's a shock to you?
$C: Eh, I would say that is not only incorrect, it is completely incorrect.

If something includes a brand logo, *it is undeniably marketing*. This is why these logos are trademarked all to hell and back, so the parent company can quickly remove any unauthorized use of said logos in situations they do not like. 
$C: For education purposes.
$C: Why *not?*
$C: They went the /r/extramile
$C: People order our patties?
$C: Why did I click...
$C: Ugh I can smell that sub
$C: They probably noticed the day of and were laughing just as hard
$C: Food-like product?
$C: Point. Alright, free "Food™"
$C: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
$C: Advertising isn't just to convince people to go there if they wouldn't otherwise, it's just to keep your brand in people's minds on an ongoing basis. There are plenty of huge companies that are household names that wouldn't "need" to advertise, if it weren't for that. Like there's nobody who isn't aware of Budweiser, but they still spend millions advertising at the Superbowl. If you're not on the top of everyone's minds, your competitors start to be instead.
$C: Of course they do. Companies are always looking for new ways to advertise and they’ve been advertising on Reddit for a while now.
$C: Does the Coca Cola corporation need to paste it's red and white logo on every surface in every major city. Probably not, but they do any way. 
$C: Then the poster could have a little comedy to it, instead of being like every other ('real') poster McDonalds has. This is somewhere between r/madlads and r/hailcorporate.
$C: From the post, they’re college students who decided to spend 85$ To our something that promotes the McDonalds brand including slogan instead of just something funny. Nothing about this “prank” is interesting enough to justify its insane upvote numbers.
$C: How dare you imply that not every action in the world is at the root of a deep state conspiracy.
$C: Not every dumb stunt gets someone a job in marketing. 
$C: It's called Astro-turfing and it's not "next level". It's been around for as long as there's been shit to sell. 
$C: Doubtful
$C: Nah, a few days maybe or as soon as this blew up 
$C: Even so, at least it would have had a point.
$C: inb4 this gets taken down as well. I mean, 31k upvotes in an hour for this generic relatively low-quality photo..wtf?! Something's fishy here.
$C: [McDonald's spends about $1,500,000,000 on advertising, yearly.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/192159/us-ad-spending-of-mcdonalds/)  So, I guess they do need ads.
$C: To be fair, it's more of a different marketing strategy. Companies as massive and well-known as McDonald's, Coca-Cola, etc don't advertise the same way as other companies which is primarily to inform people of a product and encourage them to try it. 

Everyone already knows about them and has tried them, and advertisements serve to remind you they exist and encourage you to try them again. That's why Coke ads are often just some positive association with the fizzy crisp sound of a can opening and someone taking a sip, or why McDonald's ads like this (real or fake) will try to make positive associations like happy fit people instead of highlighting the product.

They know you're probably going to buy their product, they want you to have their product in your mind next time you get hungry or thirsty instead of someone else's.
$C: Tell that to the ads
$C: Well I wonder why they advertise then...
$C: Is that why they have so many ads? Because they don't need them?
$C: A good portion of their business comes from people seeing the ad on tv and suddenly having a hankering for a big mac. So they definitely need ads
$C: I bet you're right. I bet if they stopped advertising tomorrow they would not lose any money. But I know but no CEO is going to risk that.
$C: Wow they should hire you as CEO, you'd save them from wasting 100's of millions of dollars per year!
$C: What the fuck do you call this.
$C: Yep, that's how they go so big, by not needing to advertise.
$C: I'm guessing you are too young to remember or too stupid to recognize the massive rebranding Mcdonalds recently went through. Ads everywhere.
$C: OK that's a laughable dumb comment.
$C: I agree, everyone already knows McDonald's® has the best burgers and fries. And right now you can get two Big Macs® for only $5!
$C: U an idiot if u think that
$C: > MCDONALD'S DOESNT NEED ADS

lol... oh how naive.  Is your argument/opinion that they spend billions (not an exageration) every year on adds just for the hell of it? 

I don't think the OP is an add, but to say McDonalds or Coca Cola or you name it, doesn't need advertising... lol that is very funny indeed.    The goal of marketing for these large companies is not to educate the public on their new product lines (although there is some of that) its to permeate the public consciousness in such a complete way that when you think 'I am thirsty' you think 'I am thirsty for a coke'.   If Coca Cola could spend 10 billion dollars and guarantee that every american dreamt about their product at least once a week, they would.  That is essentially what they are trying to do.  Get so deeply ingrained in your mind that you just casually think about them every day.  
$C: Forced as fuck as well. /u/Gaenya edits in his stupid sub into his comment once his comments get a lot of upvotes

$C: I mean the first comment is pretty legit. There are so many poor builds on DIY that are both dangerous or are going to have some serious structural issues (eg the many untreated decks that don’t leave space between boards.) 

There’s really no excuse for this as there are so many guides online. DIY does not mean guess about proper building techniques. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: I actually like that about diy. There have been a lot of posts where people did a big project without proper knowledge of what they were doing or knowledge of major safety concerns. That people helpfully point them out is incredibly useful both for the person posting so they know and for anyone reading so they don't repeat the mistakes.

$C: Or maybe it was over 90% when it hit the front page. Then reddit hive mind took effect, the people who call everything an ad started to get visibility, it was cross-posted and linked elsewhere as "look! This must be an ad!", and the downvotes started to pile up, bringing the vote ratio down.
$C: "Sorry, the machine is down... can I get you something else?"
$C: I used an old coffee can to prop open a door at work. 15 years later it’s still there. No one notices and no one cares 
$C: The whole gimmick here is the poster. They are selling the lack of diversity in the advertisement found in that location.  I don't frequent McDonalds yet I do recall those type ads and have seen more than white in them. (Not often) Also the ads are not the same from one location to the next. It all depends on the franchise owner. Heck, I've even seen a McDonald's that went full Christmas theme thanks to clever apparent loop-hole exploitation. 

Anyway, what they are selling is the lack of diversity. Anyone living in more culturally diverse cities, or watch non-english channels, knows McDonald's does have racial diversity in their ads. Also they do target specific races. So McDonald's as a whole is of no interest. So I won't just go the my near by McDonald's to check their ads. The ads at that McDonald's including the poster, are what is of interest.

$C: Hahaha you absolute retard, why tf would McDonalds of all places need to make up this shit to get recognition? They can afford to put legitimate adverts at every corner of the internet and the world, there is practically a McDonalds poster at every street where I'm from. Not to mention the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rJHC6nY4F8) they uploaded which seems very legit.

$C: Sandy Hook wasn't 100% fake. Teachers are actors. They act in front of children to get them interested in subjects. It isn't far fetched to say that most of the adults in that shooting are actors. And if you want to think about it on a more morbid level, those children are child actors that will one day become tax paying slaves to the USA. They are basically taught like little state actors.


$C: Everyone on reddit has 40$ to their name got it. Also they got 70k upvotes... isnt that reason enough to have done it?
$C: It’s a shill. 

$C: It’s probably a shill 
$C: I figured a company as big as McDonalds would find a way to come at you lol. Or make one up 
$C: I wouldn’t be surprised if McD’s doesn’t capitalize on the positive PR aspects of this and reward the guys somehow. 
$C: No but to someone skilled with the right tools, like a film major, it ought to be pretty easy..
$C: we're talking about mcdonalds lol
$C: Right, but maybe you're not associating McDonald's with young fit Asian college students when you go in there. Keeping it on your mind **positively**, was what I said. Do you think all these multi billion dollar corporations just have no idea how ads work?
$C: It's a nice ad and they paid for it. Those are just facts. 

McDonald's lost nothing and those guys spent a pretty penny. For me that's stupid. 
$C: Isn’t the point to see how many days they can have it up and don’t you think it would be a hindrance to be sued by McDonald’s
$C: Think of it this way. Even if this wasn't paid for by McD's, it's still helping them for free. That's the root of r/hailcorporate. Ads are everywhere, even if you're not aware of it.
$C: Seriously.
$C: I dunno, I’m sceptical. But alright, I guess it’s possible 
$C: Oh it definitely is clever and harmless. But they really brought in that large poster, hung it straight and level all without anyone in the restaurant saying anything or asking questions?? I mean , there is no wonder why terrorist events such as 911 happen in America if people there are so unaware ???

$C: I'm guessing it's the fact that you cleaned it every night that made it not have a foul odor.
$C: He hasn't cleaned it in 20 years.
$C: Not cleaning it often enough. The only time our ice cream machine smelled bad was when I accidentally put coleslaw dressing in it. (Chick-fil-A) and both items were in identical bags in the freezer and I was 15 lol. 
$C: I used to work at one and our manager only cleaned it once a week. It’s worked into the schedule so I think that’s all the more they’re supposed to clean it, idk. Shit stanky, though.
$C: I worked in a diner that also did major ice cream and milkshake business. Our milkshakes were made with hard ice cream, but we had 3 soft serve machines. They were cleaned down on the exterior nightly with the stars removed and the trays washed  and weekly were emptied and had some special solution run through them and taken apart on the inside. 
$C: It’s because the frosty mix uses ultra-pasteurized dairy products that could be shelf stable for weeks/months if needed. Even the ice cream component is basically stable due to the additives, but should still be kept frozen for reasons of texture. McDonalds currently does not use ultra-pasteurized milk products last I checked, but I could be wrong. The ambient heat of the machine/kitchen spoils the milk and ice cream mixture over the course of the day, and so the inside smells like a sweetened yogurt that’s been sitting in a minivan all day in summer.
$C: You notice that you can always get a frosty but never McDonald’s ice cream? Yeah frosty machines are much easier to get truly clean. 
$C: When I worked at McDonald's 7 years ago the ice cream mix itself smelled awful. It literally smelled like a bag full of farts.
$C: Upvoted for Frosty. 

I shall stop and purchase one on this very day.

$C: Good thing they didn't put that message on a bottle.
$C: Top aim 
$C: The new week long meta-reddit joke right here. 
$C: Yeah, It has scheduled cleanings and its supposed to recognised when its completely stripped down to be cleaned but you don't know if thats worked until its 100% back together... then it says it needs cleaning. Sometimes there just not time to do it again and this always happened on some day 1-2 people called out on a 5 person small store shift.

Its not even that the machine would recognize that it was cleaned, just that it was disassembled and reassembled a certain way. Its pretty stupid to do that without cleaning it though so I never heard of a store doing it without cleaning.

Usually they pull it apart and everything goes into buckets/trays of hot water to be cleaned and when the last piece comes out and get cleaned then it starts going back together. 

Luckily most parts were decently sized but there was a couple fiddly bits that, if you didn't assemble it right, would twist and sometimes snap and you'd have to strip the entire thing again to replace it.

Its food safety so we understood it NEEDS cleaning. I just wish whatever sensor they had to recognize it worked better or it gave us more detailed reasons why it thinks something is wrong. 

Anything that came out of that machine was the cleanest food/drink we had. The stores you MIGHT have to worry about are the ones where they didn't clean it for days and let it sit. The dairy mix CAN mold but usually when it warms up after sitting for a day that stuff would stink like bad milk anyway so it'd be obvious.

If ours went down we immediately emptied whatever it had and ran hot water through it to flush out whatever was left. Then if it was the first cleaning that day we had this cleaning powder stuff that was mixed with water that killed everything possibly bad.

I realize now that i'm literally just rambling about it. That thing became my daily responsibility and I even went to other stores in the area to train them how to use/clean/maintain and disassemble it.

I'd be surprised if the models haven't changed but given McD was mostly franchises and those machines cost a fortune.... its possible. 
$C: You should make a training video.

$C: England or USA? My experineces are England and its possible theres model differences between the two countries. 

We also got bought by a franchiser who upgraded everything and the machine came with that. I was only there about 3 months at that point. 

Most stores nearby had the same machine or 1 model up or 1 down depending how busy the store was. 

Given you had different size mcflurrys it sounds like not England? I don't remember different size flurrys.

Our ice cream still had a pull handle too.

We had about 5 minute warning of it going bad if it started sharting ice cream everywhere. 
$C: McDonald's has a LOT more customers than a Dairy Queen, as well as a much larger focus on ice cream and milkshakes. They probably have multiple machines so that even if one is down, there are still others that can operate while the other is fixed.
$C: Oh fuck this post is giving me flashbacks.

Heat cycle is what I forgot and the spiral thing bending happened a handful of times but not often.

I don't remember having issues with the hoses except a slow leak once in a blue moon. 

We didn't have our maintenance work on it though, usually managers. 

You definitely had the same or similar machine. The stupid spiral rod thing in the center is key. 

Never broke the door though. We did have someone filling it with those giant bags and slip, dropped the bag on the floor and it split at the top and launched that sugar dairy mix EVERYWHERE. 

Did you also get issues with the soda compressor and it just starts making that hissing/spitting noise constantly? 
$C: I can't really speak to that. I didn't own the business.

From what I understood with some other issues over the years is that we had to use specifically approved equipment. 

Plus we were a fairly quiet store. The machines cost a good bit and I don't know if the dairy mix just works with other machines? I assume it does but I don't know.
$C: Yes think of me!
$C: Mcds on suicide watch
$C: Mcflury is a machine that just spins around. It usually is the only machine that breaks because it is too fragile. The ice cream machine which also makes the shakes, sundaes and ice-cream are separate. There is so much shit to clean when your done or just in the middle of the day. Mcflurry is just ice cream with Oreos on the top and mixed well
$C: Soft serve ice cream.
$C: Are they mint? I like mint chocolate. I Thought they were just green.
$C: I think you owe me an apology
$C: It is 100% illegal, like many of the practices of many big businesses against their employees. The single largest sector of theft is wage theft. It's not even necessarily difficult to get enforced, but between lack of knowledge, fear of retaliation (which, even if provable, might not help much), unwillingness to face income risk, and other modes of exploitation, we continue to have non-functioning ice cream machines at McDs. 

And people who are aware of these problems and know how to handle them are usually also in situations that allow them to find jobs that aren't McD's or other minimum wage. 

So an illustrative fact: A full 5/6ths of the wage theft cases that win never see a dime in compensation.
 
$C: If it's down during the daytime, it's pretty much never a cleaning issue. High volume stores/extra hot days just have so many people ordering that the machine literally cannot keep up. It needs *time* to turn the milk into ice cream. The machine isn't *broken* but it certainly isn't giving anyone ice-cream, and the employees don't have all day to explain that to each customer, so... "broken".

Plus it can throw a fit if it's not kept at the right fill level and that could send the machine into Heat Cycle which means bye-bye ice cream machine for a few hours.

Perhaps these two live in an area where there are lots of McDonald's (so no particular one gets super busy) or very low population density, or more temperate weather.

When I worked at BK, the ice cream machine always worked. All day every day. It was just not busy enough to stress the machine. I also worked at McDonald's across the street, and during summers that sucker would "break" at least once a week.

If it's down during the night however... it's probably being cleaned. I don't know why people are so appalled by this news. The machine has to get cleaned at some point, and night shift gets the honors. It takes too long to wait until after close to start the process.
$C: Yes, but it is clearly a common issue that many people experience. To pretend it is exaggerated or redditors are making it up is idiotic.
$C: I dont normally but ever sonce theyve had the deal for a $1 of almost any burger everyday i go like 3 times a week and just get a big mac or qtr pndr with cheese.
$C: I used to live two minutes from a McDonalds in my party years. I can confirm that not only is that thing always out of service, but they also always send you to a parking spot and make you wait 20 minutes for your food. And it's wrong when you get it about 40% of the time. McDs blows. 
$C: What does a broken ice cream machine have to do with a shitty area? 
$C: How could you possibly know this? Why do you think you are correct about this, do you have any supporting evidence?

$C: Which starts to smell a little bit #hailcorporate. I'm not saying it is, but it checks all the boxes that a real advertisement would check and now we have a McD ad on the front page on one of the most popular sites on the internet thanks to a good and tricky headline that gets upvotes.
$C: >one of them was graphic design 

I am graphic design. All of it. 
$C: It's not that difficult to draw a circle in InDesign, and put a dotted stroke on the circle element. Then replicate that a different couple places on the picture and add a McDonalds logo. Fuck you could probably do that shit in PUBLISHER!
$C: Those clothes look so clean.
$C: You are not allowed to watch any Star Trek or Star Wars movies with me.  In fact, we just aren't going to any movies together at all.
$C: >Not to mention a poster that size isn't cheap. 

Since becoming an adult with a big-boy job, I have discovered that these things are a lot cheaper than I would have imagined. 

Business cards are like ~~$5~~ $10. I could print out hundreds of cards that say... ANYTHING I WANT on them. 

Poster of that size are at the ~~$100~~ $50 range. The problem is you'll burn a night or two fiddling around in photoshop, and you'll be simultaneously proud of the result and able to nitpick every little thing in it.

Depending on how deep your pockets are, you can also make life-size cardboard cutouts at the ~$100 range, giant posters can be as cheap as $5, depending on what you're printing exactly, a shitload of duct tape in every color is a couple hundred, rope is really versatile and very cheap, carpet remnants are in the $5 range, paint is $5, etc. etc. Long story short, if you're letting $100  get between you and your dreams, then you're not living.
$C: They used wall mounting tape. Unrollling and sticking a poster takes 20 seconds ... Why would you need to drill holes to mount a poster?

And it looks like the side seating area of a McDonald's -- the bit by the bathrooms that's well out of view of the registers.

As for why it hasn't been removed: it's good marketing, even if the guys who did it didn't intend it to be. Hell, it's good marketing for the guys that did it.
$C: if you put a hard hat and safety boots on, or just look the part with a bag of tools, nobody questions you. and if they did in this case, you could just say that corporate sent these posters out for the local franchises.
$C: > Not to mention a poster that size isn't cheap

Uh...... getting a poster that size, looks to be a 4'x3' perhaps on foamcore isn't THAT expensive. I wouldn't call it cheap enough for something like THIS, but if you got the extra cash, why not. However, how you gonna bring in a 4' x 3' rigid board print and hang it on a wall without anybody noticing? Either like you said it's a fake or they had some friends that work there that brought it in and hung it
$C: You watch their video on how they created it?

$C: According to the video, there is adhesive on the back, and the poster was $85.

If anything, it's an ad for Office Max's poster printing services.
$C: You're a dipshit.  It's printed on poster board and 3m tack tape is 5 bucks.
$C: Any company could give me a couple hundred bucks to post an ad with my account, no problem. I assume it would be the same for most other people too.
$C: I wonder how much they pay for an account 
$C: So, there was no McDonalds ad then?
$C: Speak for yourself 
$C: Supersize it !

$C: And make me Asian!
$C: And an apple pie!
$C: Honestly how fast food places make money. Large fry costs like $3...you can get 3 cheeseburgers for that price and like a 5 pound bag of potatos. 
$C: sir the fries are cut in approximately the same proportion, we dont have "large fries" we just have a greater volume of fries for u to eat u ffffffffffuck
$C: make that the whole deep frier. You know what just give me a large McDonalds soda cup of that french fry oil.
$C: Well it's a pretty good stunt, because now I'm craving two all beef patties special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions on a sesame seed bun.
$C: Factttttt 
$C: If this post is an ad then it's probably the best one I've ever seen. And whoever came up with it is a genius.

$C: Wow, public telephones! I thought that was some kind of weightlifting equipment at first.
$C: What, you don't think people will be up in the McD's wondering what brand of fries they have there?? 😏
$C: Why didn't you link [directly to the French fries?](http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html#1f35f)

Also, wow... while it does vary between platforms, they all consistently use McDonalds packaging. I wonder if McDonalds has [Kleenexed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_generic_and_genericized_trademarks#List_of_protected_trademarks_frequently_used_as_generic_terms) themselves.

I may be wrong, but I don't think a lot of commenters here realise how deliberate every single detail is in advertising. And, it's because it all has a small, but cumulative influence on our behaviour over time. 
$C: >However, as a viral ad it works well.

Wait a minute, are we getting played here? Is this whole post just astroturfing? 

$C: And just the way he's holding it in general. Who would ever approve that?

$C: Hey bro, you're super fit. By reddit standards.
$C: Yes they absolutely are. Also there's no real incentive for the majority of Americans to have a refined ability to tell other cultures apart. If you're born in the US you're just American and a defining characteristic is the big melting pot of cultures. Most of us are so far away from any different culture and don't travel. So yeah, we're pretty ignorant to the world.
$C: The point is that to most white Americans they're ethnically ambiguous
$C: I don't know, I didn't go to a Burger King.

FTFY
$C: I hear the French have a particular distaste for anything that smells of England, I assume it includes use of the imperial system of measurements.
$C: He's a smart motherfucker.
$C: Oh man I didn't realize you were referring to that random guy--I thought you knew that actor's reddit handle! Oh well. Small brain on u/pac-men, I guess.
$C: Same in the UK.
$C: As usual, the best of both worlds is in Canada!
$C: And it’s called a “quart de livre” in Quebec... We speak French, use kilometres for distances, Celsius for temperatures but also use pounds/feet/inches measuring people and weirdly Fahrenheit for pool temperature! 

Also grams and ounces as unit of pot...
$C: From Wikipedia:

In most markets that do not use imperial measurements, the Quarter Pounder is known as the Hamburger Royale, Royal, McRoyal, or variants thereof. In France, Belgium, and Portugal the Quarter Pounder includes cheese as standard and is named Royal Cheese. In Italy, formerly known as McRoyal DeLuxe, it goes by Deluxe, Cheese and Bacon variants.

In English-speaking countries such as Australia, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand that have adopted metrication or have partially adopted metric units such as the UK, the product retains the Quarter Pounder name (although, in French-speaking Canada, it is known as Quart de livre). The term Quarterão com Queijo is used in metric Brazil, Cuarto de Libra con Queso in Spain and in Latin America, and Quarter Pounder Cheese is used in Sweden and Finland. In the United States and South Africa there are two variations: the Quarter Pounder with cheese, and the Quarter Pounder Deluxe. In some Middle-Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates, McDonald's provides both a Quarter Pounder and a McRoyale burger on its menu, the McRoyale having slightly different ingredients. In Hong Kong, the Quarter Pounder is known as a "full three taels" (Chinese: 足三両) in Chinese because three taels is approximately equal in weight to a quarter pound, while the English name Quarter Pounder is retained. In Taiwan it is known as "four-ounces beef hamburger" (Chinese: 四盎司牛肉堡). The Quarter Pounder is unavailable in mainland China. In Russia and Ukraine, it was known as Royal Cheeseburger, and since 2016 in Russia it is called Grand Cheeseburger. In Japan, the name was a katakana representation of "Quarter Pounder" (Japanese: クォーターパウンダー Kwōtā Paundā).
$C: No, no, no. Your homework is not done until you watch Pulp Fiction (assuming you are over the age of 16). 
$C: Depends what timeline we're in 
$C: I don't know about Paris, but Barcelona McDonald's was actually really good.

If they took off the labels, I wouldn't have even known it was a McDonald's burger.
$C: So you know that commenter, who called them fit, is American by looking at the right side of the image? The fuck? 
$C: It gets deeper. Now the seed is planted for Harold and Kumar 4: Return of the Despacito
$C: If you want to be cynical by all means, nobody is going to stop you. However, if you watch the video it's pretty clear its likely not a marketing stunt
$C: >If it wasn't this itd be a prequelmemes "yep" post or something.

But here's the thing, /r/prequelmemes actually does have a huge, grass-roots fanbase on reddit. McDonalds, as far as I know, does not, so how does their content get upvoted so hard and so fast to /r/all on such a regular basis?
$C: Nope, Doing something right. It’s lazy, dated design but random geometric shapes, particularly circles, laid over images or color fields was in some major corporate branding about... omg I’m old, about 10 years ago.
$C: You'll be such a model Kraftwerk will sing songs about you, bro.
$C: Pitter patter, let's get atter.
$C: The poster is not professionally made. The outsourced social media response does look professionally made.
$C: Throwback to when artisanal was a PSAT meme 
$C: Exactly how I like my succulent, 100% natural McDonald's beef patties cooked 
$C: I’m not an ad. That’s for damn sure. 

I just like to sit back with a nice, refreshing Wolf Cola^^™️ and think to myself, can’t these companies let their products speak for themselves instead of these pathetic shady marketing campaigns? 
$C: Yeah that was my thought. Sort of downplaying what he actually said, and then completely ignoring that he doubled down on it when given the chance to recant.
$C: The astroturfing os probavly referring to him being cool in the first place. He was always an egocentric dick who underpaid and undervalued his employees but now people are seeing through the 'astroturf' and realising the truth. Same with CDPR and to a lesser extent Bill Nye when he made that shitty show and fell from grace.
$C: Except you just fell for the bullshit that man pulled out of his ass about teens

$C: [Propane, Oxygen, Oxygen, Propane](https://i.redd.it/dcmhwkcmumi11.png)
$C: I can't believe it's not food™
$C: Exactly, they want the first thing you think of when you're hungry to be McDonald's, or when you're thirsty to be Budweiser. It's more than just recognition, it's putting your brand to the top in the mind of the consumer.
$C: This is true. Those stringy cheese pizzas they always advertise in the middle of games have corned me into ordering shitty pizza more times than I care to admit.
$C: The best comedy is usually played straight. I would die laughing every time I saw myself and my friend up on the wall at this McDonald’s. If the poster was them looking purposely goofy, it might be more obviously “funny” but would likely have been taken down within 24 hours. This joke lives on here. A picture of them eating Burger King would be funny for 5 hours. 
$C: if there was some comedy to it it'd get noticed and taken down right away. playing it straight means that the poster gets left up until someone notices that it's not an official ad. and if they hadn't posted it on reddit, it probably would have stayed up until they renovated the space.
$C: If I was going to do this, I’d probably make it look as serious as possible with no joke. The novelty of me being in it would be novelty enough.
$C: Normally I agree that people are too jaded about the whole hail corporate thing. But this post, which is literally about a fake McDonald's add, which people are praising for looking like a real add, at the time of this post has 162K upvotes at 5 hours? Like if it is genuine, then sure its cool, but this post has absolutely blown up fast for no other reason then two dudes putting up a fake add for a huge company? People should be at least a bit skeptical of this.
$C: Agreed. As a former fast food employee: if I even noticed, let’s be honest - I wouldn’t have, I would have taken that to my grave. You could say I’d be lovin it. 
$C: *McDoubtful
$C: Thought you mistakenly added an extra zero...but those psychos spent 1.5 Billi 
$C: I think he means they don't need secret ads on reddit pretending to be user submitted content. 
$C: That doesn’t show that they *need* to, though.
$C: No, they don't NEED them. But they want them. 
$C: That's really smart
$C: [deleted]
$C: To be fair, I am easily influenced. I see someone eating something on TV and it makes me hungry for that thing. I can't deny I have gone out to get fast food after watching an ad before.
$C: Hell, they might *make* more money because they would no longer have an advertising budget. Or they divert money to regions where they actually need advertising (if only that there is a McDonald's, rather than what McDonald's is) 
$C: There's a reason they advertise. There's a reason Amazon advertises. There's a reason Coke advertises. None of them want to be irrelevant and they want to manipulate you into them being in the front of your mind when you want fast food/order online/soda. 
$C: Try Billions. But yeah. 
$C: A funny picture? It's definitely the worst ad if it is one. 
$C: Wow just right in with the insults huh
$C: Again with the insults. At least make it grammatically correct. Like this: You're a fucking retard. 
$C: Are you talking about the one where the guy was doing a major remodel and kept asking people if they thought he could remove it and everyone told him not to but he did it anyways? I think he uploaded a picture a few weeks later where the ceiling was visibly sagging.
$C: Oh man, my all time favorite was that MASSIVE unsafe deck. The OP used bricks (BRICKS) for the footings. He also did not use proper flanges and mount the deck to the existing foundation of the house.

$C: I guess I have just a little more work to do.
$C: how much?
$C: Is that comment karma or post karma? I feel like I need to cash in.
$C: If you read the comments, it was at a little over 50% when it got to the front page
$C: The real kicker is the sign on the door that says

"Fire door, this door must remain shut and never be blocked"
$C: heh, indeed.  an old coffee can filled with dirt or sand makes a fine doorstop for a heavier door.  all they care about is that the door is propped open when it needs to be.

in older manufacturing facilities and plants that have been around for a few generations, you might find a doorstop from a trash item from the 50s or 60s.
$C: Read the very first comment on this thread. It's a poster using Command and the guy goes to school for stuff like that. They did it because they wanted to and they could, they were not paid. And no, that would not cost hundreds of dollars lol I have a thick poster like that, much smaller, but it was only like $20.
$C: *What* part did you not understand?
$C: Yeah that's as easy and immediate with a guaranteed paycheck right now. 
$C: I have no money, no marketable skills nor experience. So unless you're telling me to be an escort, I don't know what business I might open. Plus, I want to go to the army. Get some experience, toughen up etc. Maybe after that with the money I'll have on the side I can open a business.
$C: The name "Blackwater" is free atm

$C: I was working for the city as a computer guy and every dept. and office all over the city would just let me in no prob, except the fire dept. offices, who would always check my identification against the employee db.  Not only that, but the firefighters were the friendliest and most helpful people too.  Pride in your work and doing it well go hand-in-hand.
$C: Alternatively a visibility vvest walk in "hi we're here to work on the (insert something that construction workers would be working on) walk right in. Hell sometimes you don't even need to say anything. Seen a movie for free doing this.

To give proper credit I got the idea from a video on facebook.
$C: Eh, I don’t think it’s that weird. If I was in his shoes, I would’ve just played it off as some kids at the restaurant offering to help him put up a poster
$C: That's the most telling part. What about this can possibly be so amazing that it's one of the highest upvoted pictures of all time on /r/pics? Are we really supposed to believe that this is all legitimate?
$C: It's been proven that companies do this. They sell packages with hundreds of fake accounts. Create a post and artificially raise it up to r/all. 

In this specific case though, I'm not entirely sure. This seems like the usual trivial dumbass shit that reddit drools over. 
$C: I think you and reddit vastly overestimate what marketing is actually allowed to do. Hint: saying your brand excludes Asians is not allowed.

$C: Search the thread. Wasn't that hard to find.
$C: I think you’re just unhappy with your position in life. Lashing out at a community that isn’t relevant to your failures is not a good look. 
$C: the teachers were paid by george soros to "die" so that muh gun control narrative can be bolstered --  most are living large in mansions like bernie sanders, lips sealed to the payments and NO ONE is asking the right questions especially mainstream media because they're in on the scam.  sandy hook was 100% fake and you're 100% fake if you don't think so, bye cuck.
$C: Woke af?
$C: The reason they did it, is because that's what McDonald's paid them to do.
$C: TIL shill is another word for common sense.
$C: Lol - well they could certainly find a way to come at them if they wanted to. I'd probably go for vandalism, trespass, and interference with property..... you know, if I were an evil multinational conglomerate...
$C: Ought to be. Doesn’t mean it still looks real at that point. Or that they’re film majors. Or that so much effort is taken to put into something for faking it. 
$C: And you only buy indie bands swag. Never owned a Pink Floyd or System of a Down shirt.  Lol
$C: > maybe you're not associating McDonald's with young fit Asian college students

I associate everything with young, fit, Asians
$C: No I just don’t think this literal meme they put up on one of 50 walls in this singular McDonald’s is as dumb as the guy I’ve been responding to seems to imply. He’s acting like this poster is benefitting the McDonald’s corporations at the cost of one of these kid’s whopping twelve dollars. Which he described as “a pretty penny”. A phrase I’d use when describing the cost of my car or a new laptop. 

Edit: I’m literally a young fit Asian and I’d never look at this poster and associate McDonald’s with young “fit” Asians. And if we weren’t talking about something else entirely I’d disagree with your definition of fit. 
$C: It's a joke they can tell their friends about. And they had fun doing it. Relax man
$C: What if the increased traffic on his YouTube channel from a viral video about it actually caused him to make money off of it ?  Is it still stupid?  Or are you just mad about someone else having fun?  
$C: Lmfao. McDonalds isn't suing someone over putting up an advertisement of the corporation. Do you know how many fucking copyright infringements occur on youtube? No one is spending the time to sue over that. 
$C: Seriously? 
$C: I mean I have the same information on this post that you do. So I guess that is what happened.  Maybe they seemed legit enough that no one said anything. 
$C: You'll always be behind and following. Sucks to be you. 
$C: *Ice cream machine breaks*
$C: That username and comment response worries me.
$C: "I am sorry, sir, but recent sabotage has left the ice cream machine unclean."
$C: *shits in ice cream machine*
$C: Probably best to just not go in general. 
$C: Yeah, I guess 20 years is just too long to not clean them
$C: That's basically how all things work.
$C: We cleaned them every night.m after close, but people weren’t the neatest pouring the shake mix in.  It was heavy, and getting 15 year olds with scrawny arms to do it resulted in a lot of spillage.
$C: I work at Krystal's we do ours onece a week and it never smells bad at all how long did you guys wait?
$C: McDonald's ice cream/shake machine actually counts down how many days until it's next cleaning on a small lcd display on the front. I think it's 8 days. That's when it gets taken apart and cleaned thoroughly. 

Every night the tubes and spouts for the shake dispenser need to be cleaned, sanitized, and left to dry overnight. There's also a set of brushes specifically for cleaning the tubes and connections. 

The machine also goes into what they call "heat mode" which is essentially a defrost cycle. This should typically start around 3am depending on the store but it's never available during breakfast. 

*At the stores I worked at anyway. Some probably have different machines
$C: Wait Wendy's or McDonald's? We would have at the Least been written up for not cleaning them One night. Plus they'd freeze up and break over night and it just wasn't hard to do it. But Wendy's was closed overnight and McDonald's is 24/7 so maybe that's why the difference?
$C: Jk thats terrible please can i have a gas mask mast....i mean boss lol
$C: It doesn't taste like that so much once it's done, it's just the milk being refined. Though I do know a specific ingredient can leave a slight sour taste at the end.

$C: I think many will be pleasantly shocked to read this.
$C: Thank you for sharing. That was an interesting read. 
$C: What I learned in this thread? 
I will work *ANYWHERE* but MacDonald's...

$C: Sound like poor training issue rather than design.
$C: In Canada. I don’t think we had to clear ours daily either, aside from the outside pieces. Ours had a pull handle as well. 
$C: Oh yeah. Compressor completely need replacing and owner just gutted it from another machine in storage

I'm short so i had to use a step ladder to fill it.  Once i lost my balance and fell backward-the bag exploded all over me in my only manager shirt at the beginning of my shift.  Nobody at home could bring me another for an hour so i was screwed.  My team was awesome about it though and two girls held up a ' curtain' of flattened cardboard boxes so i could hobo wash my hair and chest at the mop sink and i just wore a t-shirt therest of the night

We had a snow storm that was bad enough for the store to be closed for a few days.  Apparently the outlets now but the heat stayed on so we walked in to a flooded store with soured shake mix. Was awful enough we were dismissed again [after an argument. Literally an inch of water in the dining room and it was steadily dripping everywhere-even the ceiling outlets]
$C: Yeah they're mint flavour. Just mint, no chocolate.
$C: I'm sorry you're an entitled twat. 
$C: I think you're taking this a little too seriously. I was just saying I've been lucky.
$C: it really comes down to the workers. the mcdonalds 5 minutes from me often gets my order wrong or makes me wait excessively. the one 15 minutes from me I've had almost no issues with in years (and I went to that one more frequently since it was on the way to college).
$C: Yes, the McD where you lived did blow. I have one near me that blows too. I go to the one about a mile further away because they're so bad. Never had the ice cream machine broken, but their chocolate shakes are white and they insist its "normal" so last time I got a refund and haven't been back. 
$C: The staff doesn't maintain the equipment. 
$C: Ghetto managers are harder to come by and less likely to give a shit.
$C: Lmao how bad is your life that you get this worked up over an ice cream machine. Go outside 
$C: I worked at a McDonalds as a teen and then again in my 20s as a maintenance guy and the ice cream machine was only a problem when it needed to be completely disassembled to be cleaned and sanitized every few weeks and that was only because it was time consuming. We managed 5 locations in my city and the ice cream machine wasn't a problem, dude. If it's a problem anywhere it's because the place is poorly managed and the staff doesn't give a shit to maintain it. 
$C: Please, go on. 
$C: That show was my shit as a teenager. Staying up till midnight in the dark alone and shit. They even visited my hometown, Birmingham. Do you know where I can watch them again?

$C: True story: my father was so ashamed of what he created and on the day I slid and flopped into this world he began to wander the town re-evaluating  what in his life led to such a traumatically disappointing moment. I was later put up for adoption as my mother couldn't bare what she bore into existence. Story goes my father had roamed so far in his search for cigs he became a creeping smog himself. Now when an unwanted child is released from it's mother's bosom it is possible to hear the bone chilling phrase, "gotta get some cigs, be right back" followed by the slow crawl of a thick fog around the hospital. That's why whenever one of the women I keep in the basement happen to get pregnant I just slaughter the lot of them to avoid it spreading to neighbouring cells.

$C: So is this.

$C: The logo is partially obscured but we know it’s all there. Same with that 4th arm!

$C: How did they secrete the poster with only 3 hands???
$C: Effective immediately, Pitchfork Emporium no longer accepts returns. There is a planned Pitchfork protest against this policy change this evening.
$C: Nah, we’ll fix it in post. 
$C: Easily fixable in photoshop. Just remove his whole arm.
$C: Perhaps but you can still easily tell that it's the McDonald's logo even with it slightly covered up.
$C: to be fair, you're already in the mcdonalds by the time you notice that, were you expecting to look up and see wendy's logo on the fry container?
$C: The glare on the fry container also slightly obscured the logo (from a distance), so that reshoot would make a lot of sense.
$C: Maybe it can be a new and crazy idea? Cover up the logo and have people figure out who the company is? Kids these days destroying the advertising business.
$C: Maybe that suggests a close bond?
$C: And the box would be overflowing with fries 
$C: 
>My only critique is that the fry-guy on the right's fingers are *slightly* covering the M logo on the fry container. The ad agency likely would have re-shot that with his fingers out of the way.

Ad agency? Please.  

Franchises can hang their own artwork with nobody checking it. I’ll repeat what I said above:


There was nobody even checking the murals of two kids on the walls of my local one I grew up with because you can see the fingernails are super long and dirty and digging into the buns. 

It’s disgusting. 
$C: After closely inspecting said fingers, I can only see the unnatural spread. I play guitar, so I'm more than a little jealous, but are fingers supposed to ever look that way?
$C: At the same time if you don't point it directly into the camera at arms' length, it seems less staged.
$C: McDonalds logo lower right is awfully suspicious.
$C: And the guy holding the burger should be holding the burger by the edge-it makes the burger look bigger. They always do that.
$C: I love this thread, y’all got me analyzing ads for no reason now
$C: They would have just cut it off so it wouldn’t happen again. 
$C: no necessarily there is a add technique that involves covering or hiding part of the logo making your brain fill in the rest. it's often used in movies and tv shows instead of blatant full logo promotion.
$C: I watched the video about how they accomplished this. The fries are actually edited in.
$C: I'd add the critique that a trashcan with ashtray topper should not be in the picture at all.

$C: Also, the left side could be cropped more cleanly.
$C: As someone who has actually been in several McDonalds print and commercial campaigns, you are 100% correct. 
$C: What about the burger, it looks super small compared to the fries. Also, the setup with fries in the left hand and a backpack dangling form the right, is quite awkward for eating fries. 
$C: The logo must be shown!
$C: I thought that was intentional, to have his fingers mimic the arches.
$C: Also they should have cropped out the garbage can.  
But I loved their chutzpah, it was awesome.  
$C: That is an authentic french fry hold If show the logo even an idiot knows that's not how you hold the damn fries.
$C: Oh god how did I miss that?

$C: Well well well, I'm actually happy to be proven wrong.  I was correct on one thing, this little prank cost them over $100 on materials not calculating time spent on it.  I was also correct in stating that it would have been more believable if it had a quick adhesive on it.  It was indeed.  I was also happy to see the lengths that they went to get an actual McDonalds Tshirt, this proved critical in being able to put up the poster up perfectly without anyone truly noticing.  I thought this part of the prank would be the hardest and while it was definitely tense, it went smoothly from the video.  I was incorrect in guessing the quality of the poster however, I thought it was much heavier and thus it would have/could have fallen by now.  Well I'm sure after this post, McDonald's will be well aware of it, they can decide to either take it down, or contact the makers of the poster to make more as it's great publicity.  Only time will tell.  Ironically I found it funny that the entire point of the poster was the lack of diversity.  I also didn't see any mexican's in the poster, maybe we should put up another. ;)
$C: It's much easier to be a basement conspiracy theorist than it is to go to print shops or hang things on walls.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Académie_française

There is no law prohibiting the use of loan words. They are the official authority on the French language, and they just come up with French versions of new words like technical terms and encourage people to use them, but they have no legal powers and no one uses the stupid words they come up with. 
$C: I don’t know what this means, but am intrigued. Please tell me more.
$C: [deleted]
$C: > because of their laws prohibiting introducing loan-words into their language

Is that really a thing? I don't understand why something like that would be such a pressing issue as to necessitate a law. Or, that there would be enough people seeking to preserve a "pure, un-bastardized version" of the French language.

I'm of the largely unqualified opinion (I took a linguistics class 8 years ago in high school) that loan-words are one of the ways in which languages evolve. Even still, it seems like a silly or misguided endeavor, because any point in time chosen as the point of delineation for the language's preservation would be inherently arbitrary. Many of the etymologies of words in English come from German, French, Latin, among many others. There are Arabic influences all over the Spanish language. French surely has evolved over time to its current state.
$C: It’s more of a brotherly mutual love hate relationship.

$C: I guess my first question to you is "Do you believe paid Astroturfing exists on the internet", if it's "No", our conversation is over.

As for proof there are two different sides here. First, large companies have been [caught doing this like this in the past](https://consumerist.com/2014/04/17/verizon-brings-fake-grassroots-campaign-to-new-jersey-to-claim-support-for-not-bringing-real-broadband/). So yes, there is ample evidence that astroturfing is worthwhile to many companies.

The other problem with your 'proof' statement, is most sites ban blatant astroturfing. This means the accounts used to do it are well curated. They use VPNs to come from different IP addresses. They do not break any rules in their comments, and they are very rarely too controversial. Many times these accounts are bought from groups that create them for the express purpose of being sold later. 

At one time watching large numbers of these accounts and see how they correlate posting may have worked, but the numbers are generally pretty large. Another was watching said accounts after the fact to see if the controller of the account deleted them in mass. Few good media services make mistakes along those lines. 
$C: Why does it have to be a marketing conspiracy? It's well known accounts on here are sold and bought for marketing and/or propaganda. Same with Twitter, Instagram, Facebook. 
$C: >  If someone is reviewing a service

Um, yes. A review is advertising. It is the reviewers choice to positively or negatively market the product/company.

>If someone posts a picture of their friend reading a book and it gets to the front page of reddit, that's not marketing for the publisher.

Advertising has nothing to do if it is from the publisher or not.  

> It doesn't mean it was all part of some nefarious scheme to subliminally trick you into buying their shit.

Which is correct. Many people advertise for companies out of their own enjoyment for the product. You see plenty of advertising like this when people walk around in Nike shoes with *swooshes* all over them. Of course you may be missing that the product was designed for the purpose of being a walking advertisement. 

The problem you are missing here is there is lots of motive, means, and opportunity for business to abuse this situation. Astroturfing is illegal, many businesses have been caught and fined for doing it, yet it is still very commonplace because it is hard to catch and the payouts for a good campaign are far higher than the fines levied by government watchdogs. 
$C: Yes
$C: Do you also stock propane accessories? 
$C: Not if they switched the wrappers or something, like if they put a whopper in the wrapper and BK fries in the MCD container... But then on second thought that would still be really subtle that I don't think anyone would catch.
$C: True, but I'm trying to figure this out play by play... they spend howevermany hundreds of dollars having a high-quality poster printed, mounted (onto it own backing) that has absolutely nothing amusing or funny about it at all, their 'punchline' is that 'we're not actually paid by McDonalds, we paid to do this!'. 

I just don't get the point man, I really don't. I have a sneaking feeling that 1) they work for McD's 2) the poster is a real poster 3) the uniforms are real uniforms.

Before I get some 'nothing ever happens' shit, do you think it's more likely that they spent hundreds and many, many hours of work in total, a photoshoot to get that shot, post-processing and adding text/etc., having it printed and mounted by a sign shop, making fake uniforms to go install it themselves... all just to put up a perfectly normal poster with nothing different besides 'teehee our faces'.... or they happen to be the actors/models from a real McD's poster, and they just called them up them to pose at a table, and one of them in uniform momentarily. 

Which is a shit-ton more extraordinary effort for approximately zero giggles, and which sounds like an average Tuesday morning at an ad agency?
$C: Whereas I would have zero interest in anything to do with it unless I could blend a dozen subtle low-opacity penises into every part of the photo. My novelty standards are pretty out there.
$C: Wait, you’re saying it’s probably fake because otherwise it would be less popular? What a weird conclusion. 
$C: Reminds me of when I noticed someone put googly eyes on a ton of ads at work. Took 3 days before anyone removed them.
$C: Really though it would be way better, like with this post it's like.. ok well you sightly improved the advertising for McDonald's within a McDonald's? What a couple of mad lads I guess?

Like even if the store owner or a manager realized what was going on I seriously doubt they would step in.. just look at it and go "well, it looks good and it fits? May as well keep it"

This entire post just screams "two McDonald's marketers decided to feature themselves in an ad, put it up in a random store then take another picture that serves as the real ad when posted to Reddit alongside a quirky kooky story about two best friends!"
$C: Former fast food worker here... people use to take things off our walls and I never noticed they were missing.
$C: Well they're world wide. That money is spent on most every country on the planet.
$C: Did you mistakenly forget the 0, n and s in Billi0ns? 
$C: And none of them are even Mac Tonight! Pshh, what a waste on marketing 
$C: [deleted]
$C: I dunno... For a few thousand dollars they got at least 20,000 people to think about McDonalds.
$C: That 1.5 billion doesn't just go towards television and print media you know.
$C: You saw that number right? That money is getting used in ways you'd never believe. Just like this ad right here. 
$C: Except reddit is one of the most visited sites in the world, and this would have cost them next to nothing. And who the fuck would actually spend the time and money to put up a poster of themselves in a McDonalds?  And why would the workers not question random dudes hanging shit up in their restaurant? And why wouldn’t the manager notice and take it down?
$C: So they spend that for fun?
$C: So what's your point? 
$C: Are you smokin' yet?!
$C: The walking dead must be an awkward time for you 
$C: 52 thousand upvotes on one of the most popular social media sites which translates to hundreds of thousands if not millions of impressions within hours, and many people don't even consider it advertising. You can't buy that sort of thing, or can you?
$C: Why should I, you didnt..
$C: Lol yeah I think that was the one. I couldn't find the original DiY post or even the AskReddit post sadly.
$C: I like how it ended with him admitting fault, seemingly? 
$C: Eeeeeeeek!!!!!! I uh.....I......Oh nvm. Fuck that guy! 
$C: Then the baby is going to be scarred forever and is going to grow up and become the next Hitler. All because you used tape smh......
$C: Reddit has its fair share of bots.
$C: Yes.
$C: you okay, buddy? you seem to be spending a lot of your labor day being a jerk to random strangers online over a college kid’s prank
$C: boooooooo
$C: Yeah totally not creepy, genders reversed. 
$C: Don't forget *aggressively*
$C: Well now I know how I'm decorating my porch for Halloween this year! 
$C: Wut
$C: No u
$C: I mean, if you're too stupid to be able to work at McDonald's, then I would say you're pretty stupid.
$C: stupid enough to think anybody that works at mcdonads is dumb

you are pretty stupid

$C: 100 IQ: making shill posts about your company and upvoting it

200 IQ: upvoting other people's posts praising your company
$C: Ugh
$C: That may be true but because it is true sometimes doesn't mean you should assume it is true all the time. That starts turning into conspiracy theory type paranoia. Just because there are some conspiracies, it gets to be tin foil hat paranoia when you start seeing them everywhere.
$C: If we really want to tinfoil it, you can have one of your shell companies do the vid. That's what I would do. Not like they're going to trace my shell company in Cyprus via a Dutch foundation sponsoring a US art project for some youtube vid.

I'm merely saying that if you want to, while having the resources and infrastructure in place, it's not that hard to make stuff seem like something they're not. When you have that it's essentially just asking a question and writing a check.
$C: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
$C: Yeah I bet their pr likes to flaunt their lack of diversity in posters. Also the fact that they can just walk around fooling the staff putting posters up, so positive. I don't like r/hailcorporate shit either but this is not one of those things. 
$C: Something about this is off. How much would that cost to print???
$C: What did they vandalize?  How can you trespass in a restaurant (unless they were previously asked to leave)?
$C: i don't buy any 'swag' and i've never owned a band t-shirt, but if you think there's no difference between supporting a band, or wishing to display your fandom outwardly (regardless of how popular it is), and physically doing free labour for a multi-billion dollar company then you may be mentally deficient
$C: >Relax man

Why do you think he's not relaxed? I know Redditors love to believe that any hint of negativity means the commenter is having a panic attack, but come on.
$C: Yeah.
$C: Haha sorry mate! I'm not mad at you or trying to be rude with you  that's just why I was confused.
$C: Just get me a fucking milkshake!
$C: Sorry sir, the machine is actually broken this time.
$C: "So clean it then!"

"It's... not *that kind* of unclean, sir."
$C: Just buy a new one!
$C: Just a couple days too long
$C: Yeah? What about a sponge that is designed to smell worse the more you clean it?
$C: Damn scrawny armed 15 year olds, good for nothing 
$C: Never worked at McDonald's.
$C: The older, machine my store had was required to be cleaned every two weeks, iirc. 
$C: McDs. Unless they’d do a light cleaning at night or something. The manager would take it apart for a deep clean once a week though which I thought wasn’t very often. Always smelled bad on cleaning day though so I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s all the more they did it.
$C: https://v.redd.it/0jbc8dlcaxj11
$C: I work in IT now, it was my next hop after McDonalds. I did it while I worked at mcdonalds too but it was small part time work. I made it full time after I quit mcdonalds. They changed management and would fuck with peoples schedules last minute and just expect us to call in every day to find out what we worked. "If you don't like it you can quit" and I didn't like it.

Went as full time as I could until I got a Consultation job.

Out of the frying pan and into the fire.
$C: Tell me about it; I have an hp laser printer in my office that says it’s jammed. I’ve taken that thing apart at least ten times. I mean ALL THE WAY APART.

Those things just like to lie.
$C: Every workplace has issues, it might not be the ice cream machine but it could be Debby from HR who won't stop sending a million emails.

Theres an ice cream machine at every work place. It takes many forms.
$C: Interesting. Ours definitely locked out if it wasn't cleaned in 24hr. Maybe when they're setup it was manually set that way by the installer.

I know we all used the same installer in that area. 

I'm ok doing more cleaning that required though. Its food/drink. 


$C: In my experience, it usually comes down to 1) the owner(s) [if it’s not a corporate store] and then 2) store managers. Usually, all the shitty stuff gets passed off to the night people, and night shifts are often grossly understaffed. Additionally, that’s usually when the inexperienced high schoolers are scheduled (who never get trained properly because understaffed). Also, low wages and shitty working conditions are not typically going to attract the most desirable candidates. The shit always trickles down from the top.
$C: Again, has nothing to do with a shitty area.

$C: Yeah star trek, especially tos, is easy to pick apart from a production stand point but the essence of the show is super creative. 

This McDonald's ad is pretty creative, too, I guess, but the essence of its creativity is that it's too subtle to be spotted, which it has been. 

And water is the essence of moisture. 
$C: TNG tried really hard. They made some mistakes, but I always blame the scale of the show for those, and they mostly worked past them. 

I also really liked the tongue in cheek things like the "Heisenberg Compensator"

That poster looked like 3ft x 4ft right? That's only $40-$50 https://www.staples.com/sbd/content/copyandprint/banners.html My company's gotten these real tall prints for the backdrop of our booths at conventions. Those are the ones that are $100: https://www.staples.com/sbd/content/copyandprint/banner-stands.html
$C: Actually, half the stuff on the list is from building a cat tree. I used to be a boy scout and thought it would be fun to lash 2x4s together instead of using nails/screws (plus cats like rope), so that's the carpet, rope... and I didn't mention the 2x4's, shit. 

It's a lot of lashing, so I don't recommend it unless you enjoy blisters and sore arms. It's been standing for 2+ years, including a week of a 40 lb kid climbing all over it.

The duct tape was a duct tape outfit competition. My friend did not win, but has finally managed to get through the rest of it. Posters/cards/prints have been for work and weddings.

$C: This is also one of the reasons Quebec French is different than Parisian French.
$C: So, as I understand it there’s a government office whose sole purpose is to prevent the “degradation” of the French language by ‘invasive’ culture. Instead of introducing loan words, they agree upon a truly French way to phrase global concepts and stuff. Idk, weird
$C: Kindergarten isn’t imported, they have names for each preschool grade. 3-5, each year is a *section*, starting with petite, then moyenne, then lastly grande. So kindergarten is  la grande section.
$C: You seem upset. Get off reddit every once in a while. 
$C: I'm actually not seeing any legal authority for them to tell anyone what specific terminology to use - but they do seem to have some sway with corporations and journalists. 

And it sounds like they only really care about English loanwords - when they sense a new word being picked up from English, they don't prohibit the term, but work to publish and popularize an equivalent term derived from French. So in that way, they continue to evolve with other modern languages, but without that jarring bit where when you hear English words splattered through the speech of someone speaking a foreign language.

$C: Exactly.
$C: Probably not, but this is my headcanon anyways.
$C: graphic designer here, I could most likely put this poster together with a digital camera (whatever someone has), a hamburger meal, and about 15 minutes, tops. who's to say this was even a high quality print? you can get these printed and delivered to your house from the internet pretty affordably. looks like it's just taped to the wall, even. 

and, finally, most people wouldn't notice but this is far from professional McDonald's quality. the framing, lame circles, and not picture-perfect mouthwatering food says amateur to me.

"approximately zero giggles" is just your opinion, i had a bit of a giggle and I'm sure had it been my poster I'd have had quite a few more. 
$C: There's a video of them making and putting it up. They took the pic, did a quick Photoshop edit that anyone could do easily, and ordered a print for $80. It's only hanging there with double-sided mounting tape. This really isn't all that outlandish.
$C: Because it's amusing, especially if you're a bored/stoned marketing student. This sounds exactly like the kind of shit my friends and I would have done in college.
$C: The poster cost $85. The guy has a YouTube channel and posted the behind the scenes video of this. As the guy said below if you have some photoshop skill the edit is 15-20 minutes tops. 

It doesn’t have to have an obvious joke to be funny. This is an inside joke that they can tell their friends and now the internet about and have a good laugh. Worth the $85 and couple of hours tops imo.

$C: One year at my college campus (GT), a few people began gluing googly eyes to just about everything on campus. All trashcan lids had them. Street lights, bike racks, and street signs all were adorned. It was pretty funny and lasted longer than I would have thought.
$C: Here is how I see this actually working out in real life:

Right now, some manager who made this McDonalds HIS LIFE has noticed this poster--shit, he noticed IMMEDIATELY. He assumes that someone else has been in communication with the franchise owner, and made the decision to display this poster without informing him. He doesn't want to admit he didn't have any say in this marketing decision, so he is quietly stewing, trying to undercut the night manager's authority, while he tries to figure out why he is being cut out of store decisions despite his tight relationship with the owner.

Most of the cooks/everymans (because everyone does everything at McDonalds nowadays) are totally unaware that anything has changed. They just realized the day manager, Mike, has a huge stick up his butt, and they assume his wife left him or whatever.

The franchise owner comes in for his quarterly "eyes on the shop." He says "who put that poster up?" No one has an answer. He figures it looks professional, but he has rules to follow because corporate will fucking ream his ass if he let's these things go. He demands its taken down.

Corporate sees it. They sort through their marketing materials for a few weeks. They realize its not one of theirs, but it seems.... right? They're confused. But they demand it's taken down.

Thankfully, some intern saw this post on reddit. He takes it to the marketing team, they love it, they contact the artist and pay him for the assets and such, this becomes their property, and that intern works for McDonalds for the next decade until Wendy's pays him more.

Tale as old as time...
$C: I agree with you completely. Though I could see it either way.
$C: The YouTube they put up off how and why said they wanted Asian representation. There's another post in here with a link to the Twitter of the guy on the right and a YouTube of how and why in that tweet.

$C: Thanks for your input
$C: I repeat:

>In this specific case though, I'm not entirely sure...
$C: That’s fair. And things like that most likely happen all the time without us even realizing it. I’m still of the opinion that in this specific case, it’d be pretty fun for McDonald’s to have any relation to this simply bc of the liability that it gets traced back to them. And bc these are kids...
$C: good one.  enjoy your life of ignorance and being a sheep.  only DJT can save us from the deep state by draining the swamp and even he is being met with great resistance and they are trying to ILLEGALLY remove him from office.  then again, you probably will enjoy your small and simple life because they say ignorance is bliss.  i will pray for you and will fight for yours and everyone else's right to live in a free society not ruled by FBI cucks and deep state mainstream media lords.
$C: Found it. [$85.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=72&v=0rJHC6nY4F8)
$C: So it just has to do with the technical definitions here - I am not for a second suggesting this is a reasonable or likely approach - rather this is a 'if you wanted to find a way' type of legal argument.

- When they attach the picture to the wall, they have likely had to affix something to it. If this has interfered with the fabric or make up of the wall in any way, then it is possible to argue that the wall has been 'damaged' and thus vandalised.

- Tresspass, on the basis that they are granted access to the property under a set of conditions (pretty typical with private property like a restaurant), one of which will likely have been that they don't damage, deface or interfere with the property in any way. Probably also some general conditions about behavior and actions McDs considers antisocial etc. Violating these conditions would mean that they had no permission to enter or right of access, and thus Trespass.
$C: If you think that I think there is NO difference, you are fighting to win an argument with absolutes. 

I know people that buy whataburger swag like others buy band shirts.  Liking an outwardly commercial venture is similar across types. 

On another note, I have never owned any band t-shirts either.  At least we have that in common.  :)

And y'all have to quit downvoting because you disagree with what he says. Geez.

$C: Yeah. 
$C:  No worries lol
Some of the more recent comments are saying that McDonalds was in on it. Who knows.

$C: I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE
$C: So Daniel Day Lewis can drink it up!
$C: McDonald's can't legally call it a milkshake since it's made of strictly ice cream without any added milk. Therefore it's a shake, but not a milkshake. So impress me by getting me a milkshake from McDonald's.
$C: pro tip: put your sponges in the dishwasher when you run it.
$C: Damn not scrawny armed 15 year olds who aren't working at McDonald's me and this good sir want some fucking ice cream RAWR!
$C: Me neither
$C: >They changed management and would fuck with peoples schedules last minute and just expect us to call in every day to find out what we worked.

I know it doesn't matter to you now, but that's illegal. Once the schedule is posted,for there is a new pay period, any changes must be communicated to the person directly before end of day. I had to deal with something similar at a prior job myself. A new manager would make the schedule, then another manager would "correct it" in pencil, in the managers office (time clock was in another location, that's the schedule that gets read). It happened twice in two pay periods to me,the second time I told the manager that as of Sunday I wasn't scheduled and telling me two hours *after* I'm *supposed* to be there means I ain't gonna come in and reprimanding me for it would result in Labor board investigations.
$C: “PC Load Letter, the fuck does that mean?”
$C: Lmao you're not wrong.

At my job it's three brothers who have been there for 7 years and think they can do whatever they want.. show up an hour late and clock out early,push their work off on other people ect.

Luckily I don't have to interact with them at all and all the machines required for me to do my job function as they should.So my Debbie from HR exists but she's busy pissing off my boss lol
$C: My fucking apartment complex won’t calm down with the emails 
$C: Oh OK. 
$C: Yes it does.

I know all the McDonalds around my work and home area and along the way.  Those in nice neighborhoods get the orders right and rarely have problems supplying the items on the menu.  Those in shitty areas perpetually have problems getting orders right and often say the ice cream machine is broken or have other excuses not to take orders for certain menu items.

I am very confident that the issue is the mentality of the workers.  People don't travel far to work their McDonalds job, so when drawing from a labor pool of people who live in shittier neighborhoods, you get workers who just don't give much of a shit.  This attitude is generally why they live in shitty neighborhoods... they don't have a can-do attitude or give a shit about taking steps to improve their situation.

I know you don't want to believe that because that's why you originally objected with your silly original post above, but everyone with half a brain knows this is true.  
$C: Remember when you got super upset about an ice cream machine 
$C: I’ve never been happier with a thread of comments than this

$C: A little bit better than that. You are real, but in a simulation. 

Also you were adopted. We both thought it would be better this way.
$C: Has nothing to do with equality and everything to do with her being generally terrible. 
And I fucking hate Trump. I do not however think she should be our only option for a female president. 
$C: It has nothing to do with equality. It has everything to do with that she's a terrible candidate

$C: Chill out. He was speculating. I would hardly call it fact. 
$C: I just noticed based on your reddit post history, most of your comments include some kind of derogative term.  Since this is typical behavior from you, I'm just going to ignore you and also agree with you.  Sometimes you do have to call someone a dipshit!, "Dipshit".  Have a nice day.
$C: The radar sir! It appears to be JAMMED!
$C: Let me speak to the manager please. I want my order supersized
$C: The joke was that McDonald's doesn't want people knowing what the special sauce is.
 
But, yeah - it's thousand island with extra relish.
$C: There’s a whole video he made documenting what they did. The irony of you accusing people of being fooled as you fool yourself is just too much. 
$C: Well. Keep it up then, I guess.
$C: Thank you for clearing that up. I thought there was some trickery going on
$C: "I'd like a Big Mac and a medium ice tea... to go. That's all. Thank you."

^(r/IDontWorkHereLady)
$C: But apparently it’s not good enough of an ad even though it made the front page lol
$C: I think it's redeemed a bit in that McDonalds fry boxes are pretty distinctive in design, and the logo in the corner help to reinforce that. 
$C: They see the logo everywhere in the store already. It’s an ad association. Hell the McDonald’s I used to work for has local sights on the wall and not just people enjoying the food. 
$C: There is no subconscious association to make when the logo is plastered right in front of your face clear as day. Putting the logo in the corner is making it easier for the brain to digest... it’s literally saying “This is food from McDonalds”
$C: Ah I see what you meant now. Lol

$C: >if you don’t have proof for what you’re saying then don’t say it.

Yea, your response can suck eggs.

>Because, quite often, 

Is what I said, a statement that is not a definitive. I did not state this particular thread absolutely is astroturfing. 

What I did infer by my statement is that posts with 'corporate' content are 'quite often' sponsored in a manner that is hidden from the end user. *All* users should be aware this is very common and apply some distrust to every post because of it. 

If users where more aware of this, maybe we wouldn't have issues such as "Did Russia Influence the American Presidential Election". 

Furthermore I hold even more distrust to any potentially commercially or political posts since the 'means, motive, and opportunity' favor the said group astroturf.

Means: "A few vpn accounts, a number of social media accounts, a marketer capable of not drooling on their keyboard" 

Motive: "Money. Advertizing is a multibillion dollar industry. And we all know the stakes in politics"

Opportunity: "Well, we are here on Reddit, aren't we"

If you want to use something as simple as  a search engine you can easily find out that astroturfing is a large industry. This should really be established as fact these days. There was a lot more doubt when I made the same argument back in the mid-2000's. Now you can easily go hire a service to do this for you.

$C: This is much more than a "brand being visible" the brand itself is in very close association to the subject matter. 
$C: > No, it isn't.

Just what the hell do you think a review does?

advertising: *n* the act or practice of calling public attention to one's product, service, need, etc., 

A review calls attention to said product. Advertising doesn't have to be positive, it can be a negative. 

>Yes, it does.

No it doesn't per the fucking definition of the word advertising itself. 


$C: You're a professional, I'd figure there's at least an hour or two of editing by the average photoshop-downloader, on top of going out to do that photoshoot to start with (another hour or two plus prep/planning?). 

Look at one of those posters in there sometime, they're not low quality or pixelated (if they went to match it well enough for no one to notice), there is a thick (1"-ish?) backing to them that gets its mountings screwed onto the wall. This is not a paper poster, it is not taped to the wall, it is mounted like every other real McD's poster. My giggles are usually much more easily and cheaply obtained then this extravagant process, but sure.
$C: My friends and I would laugh about the idea for 5 minutes, then decide that weeks of work and that much money would be better spent on a QP and junk food, going to the movies like 10x, or exploring some neat places with that time invested here, basically anything but doing ad agency work for 'fun', but you do you.
$C: Where’s the joke. They didn’t put anything interesting or funny in the poster. It just is a McDonalds poster that follows their branding to a T. Nobody posting seems to find it any more than mildly amusing, yet it is one of the most upvoted posts of all time?
$C: Read it again. Hundreds of dollars (apparently only $85 for a giant decent-res posted in that size, though) and an hour or two of work if I wanna count the mounting bits. I could slap it together in the same time (tops 30 min) in PS, and I've only ever used it casually for years. I assumed a closer-to-zero starting point.

Regardless, this shit has about *160k* upvotes right now, absolutely blasting away anything else on the front page for days, and up with the more popular posts in recent memory, and I just do not get why. Is this really the greatest thing so many people have seen all day? Really? By that insane margin? *Alrighty.*
$C: Yes! That's the one
$C: Ooh boy.

He fucked up.

He fucked up **bigtime**.
$C: Wow not only did that guy fuck up his house, but he's an absolute asshole about it too. Every single request for an update, no matter how nice, gets a snarky non-answer or insult as a reply. What a dick.
$C: Thank you so much
$C: lol I love those comments, that stupid idiot posted it thinking he'd get told how cool he and his project are and the overwhelming response is "you fucked up"
$C: I wonder if his house fell down yet.

Edit:  He was semiactive until that post. So 99% sure he died in a house collapse.
$C: Just the comment thread is creepy, it's a whole different level if you acted on it. 
$C: Woke af?
$C: Are you serious, or are you mocking me?
$C: What makes you think he's not relaxed? I think your comment is stupid, but I'm relaxed about it. You think *his* comment is stupid. Are you going to tell yourself to relax?
$C: ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
$C: Sounds like something a Synth would say or do....
$C: You don't what the word legally means
$C: It was a part time job for me when it started happening. Complaining would lose me any favors and just make my shifts dwindle down to nothing over time. Rather than deal with that I just left. 

Was a lengthy email to the franchisers though, they were nice people. SUPER worried about lawsuits after something happened like 4 years prior. I never found out what but I figured they should know and it was cathartic to write.

I heard a few months later some of the management changed around but its McDonalds so I didn't know why specifically. A lot of people worked 3-6 months before giving up anyway.

I picked my battles. I had no need to stay there and felt no reason to just make drama. 
$C: I have a clip they put letters and newsletters on. 
$C: If you think most people live in shitty areas because of their attitudes you’ve got other issues.
$C: I'm still shaking
$C: Now that's the height of topicality. 
$C: Far be it from me to turn down a request.

$C: How do you get a job driving trains? I always wanted to work on a train, but it never seemed like the opportunity presented itself.
$C: Post production team?  Somebody’s got the big bucks.  On this film the director doubles as boom operator and line producer, and the cinematographer will do the post production work.  Look at ariheretic with the big bucks to afford a team!

$C: The definition of ambiguous is: "unclear or inexact because a choice between alternatives has not been made." 

Saying that someone is from "Asia" is definitely ambiguous when discussing where someone is from, because there are ~48 countries in Asia with a cumulative population of roughly 4.5 billion people. 
$C: Okay "human" is technically more ambiguous but Asia is the largest continent and is extremely ethnically diverse. 
$C: Hence the ambiguity...
$C: Maybe it's different where you are, but I've always seen "Asian" used to refer to people from east Asia  - China, Japan, et al, and "Indian" to refer to people from the Indian Subcontinent.
$C: ...is it not exactly the sort of attitude that you would expect from the French?
$C: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Académie_française#Anglicisms
$C: Would you mind elaborating? You sound a bit full of yourself lad
$C: Do you have proof that this occurs quite often? 
$C: "The average photoshop downloader" can certainly follow a tutorial on how to make some circles and follow instructions on how big it has to be to print. Literally all that's been done to this photo is the circles and throwing in the logo. for an absolute beginner, that's an hour, maximum. I doubt they did much prep, if they had the camera handy, they could have taken this photo and been done very quickly, an hour max. There isn't a lot of planning that has to be done for a project like this, but I'd say that they would have to be creatively inclined to put in the work to do it. 

I see now that it's on a metal fixture, but it's most likely a paper poster on top of it. This photo itself is not high enough quality to say whether it's poster board or not. definitely isn't an inch thick. and honestly, I have seen some badly pixelated posters/wallpaper at fast food restaurants. Either way, if they're using a decent camera, they certainly have enough resolution to avoid pixellation. 

I can't say for certain that this is 100% a joke between friends, it is a lot of work, but it seems pretty unlikely that this would even work as a marketing opportunity for McD's. even if it's a real poster in a real McDonald's, I think it's more likely that someone took a picture of them in front of their poster and fabricated a title for karma than that this whole post was orchestrated by McDonalds' marketing team. 
$C: You see the wall before they mount it https://youtu.be/0rJHC6nY4F8?t=144 and it is blank, of course there is an Interruption where you see the guy so it could be edited but you still see the upper part of the wall first afterward and the way they put it there looks more like it sticks. Though that is some impressive sticking strength to go that quickly. Anyway I am skeptical about your mounting claim.
$C: We would do things like producing some stupid song with an inside joke and convince our friend at the local station (WYSO) to put it on the radio just so we could turn the radio on at the right time while hanging out with the person it was intended for. 
$C: So instead of being creative you would just decide to go back to being a consumer instead...how is that better? These guy's probably went to the cinema and did all the other "amazing" things you and you friends do (and everyone else in the world does), they also did this unique thing too.

Jealousy is an awful thing.
$C: You don’t have any friends lol. You go on the internet and act like a buzzkill for fun. Live your life.

 if you noticed.. these guys went viral then on Ellen then had the time of their lives, but you, you are taking the easy way out and trying to put down others to feel better because deep down you are afraid, and will never be the man your mother was. Continue being miserable, society doesn’t need people like you. 😊
$C: the fact that you can't tell shows how badly you need to be redpilled smh.  how about trying to do you own research and then we can actually have a meaningful conversation.
$C: Now you're the one who needs to relax
$C: Dude... relax
$C: Takes proper grammar to legally plead your argument.
$C: Hey, whatever helps you justify your lack of results.  But life is short, so when you grow up and hit your 30's and 40's, you can either keep blaming "the man", corporations, the wealthy, "the system" or whatever you like for not getting anywhere, or you can take control and do something about it.  Doesn't matter much to me - easier to fly like an eagle when surrounded by turkeys, as the saying goes.
$C: What qualifies one as being *qualified?* Shouting the same idiotic policies that her husband and his predecessors have been talking about for decades? Or bribing her way to the democratic nomination while stealing that seat ffrom someone who actually DOES care about equality, ending poverty/racism/etc instead of whoring out to corporations and pretending to care about issues that don't matter to her?

​
$C: Thank you!
$C: That's a reach
$C: Yes
$C: Well, they aren’t gonna steer themselves. 
$C: You’d think so, but the skill sets are actually slightly different. 
$C: No, he handles the train while someone else handles the camera.
$C: It’s mainly just being tired all the time. 
$C: Applied to be a conductor when they were hiring, worked as a conductor, then I trained to be an engineer when my seniority allowed it. 
$C: Usually “we’ll fix it in post” is uttered by the director before foisting it onto their partner who does all the post.
$C: So in your eyes there is no way in the world this could have been a prank from two friends and it has to be a corporate conspiracy? 

Being skeptical is one thing, blindly following your own bullshit makes you just as sheepish as those you try feel superior towards. 
$C: I promise you the branding is good enough. And it depends on who is shooting the ad and what kind of circulation it’s going to get. This is honestly more ad heavy than most of the images in McDonald’s. 
$C: Well... yeah you’re right about that
$C: That goes for any race then, lesser extent or not.  
Saying someone is racially ambiguous means you can’t tell the difference if someone is black or Hispanic, for example, not “which type of Asian” who cares. A white person sees the ad - they’re Asian. A black person sees the ad - they’re Asian. Nobody’s sitting there, thinking, “Well, I can see they’re Asian, but I don’t know which one!” It doesn’t fucking matter any more than if you see a white person and don’t know if they’re from Germany or Finland.  Nobody would look at a white person in an ad and think, “Wow, that’s so ambiguous.”  
On that note, I’d like to point out OP said *racially* ambiguous, not [strictly] *ethnically* ambiguous, which I’d argue is the route you specified. The race isn’t ambiguous. It’s Asian. Nobody cares where from. For what it’s worth though, a lot of people happen to think Filipino just from eyeing them. 48 countries, sure, but we wouldn’t even consider a good portion of them to be honest, again, just by looking at them. 

I don’t have enough karma to consistently reply to you, but you’re not gonna convince me.

$C: That's actually excellent, also a fuckton of work, but excellent. Regardless, yours has an actual joke/punchline to it as the entire point of doing it, and this just.... doesn't, in any way that I can see.
$C: Not jealousy, I just wouldn't wanna spend my time/money like this, I don't see the humor at all, I just see doing a fair bit of work for the weakest 'prank' I can recall. 

You remember that guy who makes his own improved highway/road signs in very high quality, and covertly swaps them for the real signs? I like that guy. That's also more *lot* of work, there's more humor in the inside-joke, but the key difference to me is that it's not spending that time just to end up with something that carbon-copies the soulless, focus-grouped marketing wank of a corporation (that doesn't have the best rep to support, of all chains), who now benefits (for free) from a metric shitton of people everywhere being reminded of McDonalds right around lunchtime today.

What I'd do differently here... do a print for a local business or something other than the most corporate thing you can find, add some actual comedy into it (it's a mural but only using those 2 guys in costumes/poses), then it's something unique, an excellent inside joke and actually has some creativity in it, then I'd be in. This is 'hey let's make a regular everyday corporate ad! no comedy, no creativity allowed'. So... meh?
$C: I'm black pilled. I also drink black semen. I am alpha.
$C: Are any of you going to tell me why you think negativity is equal to not being relaxed, or no?
$C: I’m female engineer in my late 20’s. Has nothing to do with what I said. There are lazy rich people and lazy poor people. Your comment is just stupid. Some people work hard their whole lives and just don’t ever make it. Don’t apply your experiences on everyone on this planet. It just doesn’t work that way. 
$C: Birdie is a fictional character, she's not even married.

$C: like relax your thoughts towards other people. i don't imagine you or the other commenter angrily mashing your keyboards. but if some dudes are having some fun at no expense to other people, (and i really doubt their poster increased the sales of mcdonalds by a significant amount though i admit it's a possibility this was sponsored) why do you have to call them stupid? overly judgmental = not relaxed
$C: No, my comment is absolutely on-point and based on real world experience.  You're in your 20's, so of course you think you know everything - on the other hand, I've started several businesses and I currently employ numerous people and have hired and fired lots of people in my lifetime, and led large teams of people.  My background is electrical and mechanical engineering, don't give us engineers a bad name by being willfully stupid.  Do you think the same skillsets that cause people to falter/fail in jobs really don't translate over to their personal lives?  Don't be so naive!  There are scant few highly intelligent people above their mid-20's who do landscaping for a living... if they were highly intelligent, they'd be doing something else and getting paid a lot more.  And there are scant few responsible and hard working people living in the ghetto.  Stop trying to be so PC and see the world for how it really is.  Reality doesn't care about your feelings, it just IS.

Someone working hard their entire life doesn't end up living in a slum and barely able to hold down a job.  I LOVE when I come across truly hard working people - every businessman does.  Such people have NO problem finding gainful employment and rising above their peers in remuneration and achievements - that's just how capitalism works.   Unless you're a mid-20's snowflake who thinks the world is all fairies and unicorns, apparently.
$C: "The McDs mascot, Birdie? No, we need qualified candidates" ---> You are referring to hillary as being "qualified" not birdie, although now, thinking about it, birdie might make a better prez than her.
$C: You hate her because she uses a racial epithet?
$C: No, what people are sincerely trying to tell you is we don't really care about the talking points you are trying to shove down our throats.
$C: Superduperdope

$C: Yet you can provide zero proof. 
$C: Take a look at some of the actual McDonald's billboards [posted a little upthread](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/9cmazx/they_noticed_there_was_a_blank_wall_at_mcdonalds/e5btpu8/?st=jlmjtr2l&sh=d5f75266) with partial or minimalist branding. Those golden arches don't need help in the brand recognition or familiarity department, even an obscured view is plenty to get your mind on that Big Mac.

Asswipe.
$C: Are you socially stunted?
$C: What if she came out against freedom, you would still love her?
$C: Exactly, thank you for understanding

/not sarcasm
$C: [Maybe](https://youtu.be/MgW4XlMR1gU)
$C: Because you’re the one making accusations. I saw proof, the guys personal twitter account where this was well documented. You have nothing but what you pulled out of your jaded ass. 
$C: I understand that, but that doesn't change the fact that currently, the brand is already well-recognized enough that a partial logo is easily identifiable and that many companies are moving away from advertisements that are that on-the-nose. McDonald's fries are so iconic that they themselves have marketing campaigns of the yellow fries and red fry container without a logo stamped on it. So, a poster within their own store, depicting two people eating their easily recognizable food, even though one is partially obscuring the logo on the fries with their hand, is still plenty to continue promoting their brand's image and familiarity. The inattention to the logo even makes the photo feel just a little less contrived (it's not of course, but it takes away a bit of the "you're trying to sell me something" feeling.)

$C: And 9 times out of 10, the person that says "Sources" is just being an asshole that will never read anything posted.

Years ago, when search engines were balls, and internet was slow, sources were really important. It could take someone forever to find the information. These days you can get thousands of answers on most things in tenths of a second. 

I don't have to do anything to prove the work, this is publicly available information that, in theory has been common knowledge to anyone without their head buried so far up their ass they taste their last meal. 
$C: Probably.
$C: What? I don't love Hillary Clinton. Where did you get that idea? And if she spoke against freedom, it would only reinforce my belief that she is not fit to be President of the United States.
$C: I can't say I understand, because even McDonald's CEOs need to vote for the right candidate. 

You would have the jingle be "I'm hating it."
$C: Haha I've never seen this episode. I forgot how pretty Robin is.
$C: Do you enjoy being a pedantic ass?  Like - do you put effort into it?  Or is it just a part of who you Are?
$C: Ass. Wipe.
$C: It's obvious.
$C: Would that be why, or would it be because, as you just said, you have no love for a candidate who just happens to be a woman?
$C: I don't care who you vote for, because I view that as a private decision. I don't feel the need to convert people over to what I believe because I think adults can come to their own conclusions with a little bit of critical thinking. Maybe that is where we disagree? Hope this helps you understand.
$C: Wait, so let's see here. I just said I don't like Hillary Clinton as a candidate. Fair enough. You followed that up with saying that I have no love for a candidate that "just happens to be a woman". 

What.

Where have I ever, in all of these damn responses, implied that I don't like Hillary because she's a woman? Because I'm not seeing it. Fine. Do you want to hear it? I don't like Donald Trump either. In fact, I might like him less. 
$C: You don't care if your brother says I am voting for Hitler, you just say ok I will see you for a McDonald's hamburger and fries and an ice cold coke afterwards. 
$C: But why would you vote for her if you didn't like her? Why would you vote for Trump? He's not even a woman. 
$C: Well it's a good thing Hitler isn't around anymore I suppose...
$C: Jesus Christ. Look, I didn't vote for Trump. I voted for Hillary. Shocking, right? At the time, I considered her a better choice. I never considered her a GOOD choice, by I found it better than Trump, if I'm being honest. Ultimately, Hillary lost the election, and she lost it fair and square. No hard feelings.

And why, WHY, are you criticizing someone's vote on the grounds that "He's not even a woman." I mean, you call me sexist, but you seem way more sexist than I am. The amount of sexism in that last sentence literally gave me a minor headache.
$C: Right, because no one thinks like him, huh? Guess we'll just go for a Big Mac and a McFlurry with M&Ms, everything is fine over here!! What's that, no McFlurrys? I guess I'll have a side of inequality instead!
$C: I'm just saying, he was born a man, he's not a woman. Hillary was born a woman, she's not a man. You should vote for them based on their policies. Hillary was a bad candidate, it shouldn't matter what she looks like.
$C: I'm sorry but I don't think I understand what you are getting at.
$C: Which is what I've been trying to tell you this whole time?
$C: The point is, don't vote your conscience unless your conscience for the right things. Thennnnn you can enjoy items of the McDonald's value menu. Have fries, an ice cold coke, a chicken sandwich, but have it becaaause you first voted for women candidates. Then you will truly enjoy the crispy golden fries and the signature sandwiches, so much more. 
$C: SO WE AGREE
$C: So everyone has to go along with what you think are the most pressing issues at hand? This is a prime example of what being out of touch is.
$C: Do you want an apple pie? Quarter Pounder? Quarter Pounder with cheese? Big Mac? Large fries? Shake? Ice cold Sprite? Large? Ketchup and mustard? Two cheeseburgers? McFlurry? Happy Meal? Women make all of these things too.
$C: Yeah, but I don't care what the person who made my food looks like. All I care about is whether or not they get the order right in a timely manner.
$C: You wouldn't say that if they had snot dripping from their nose
$C: I'd say that goes inside the category of getting the order right. I didn't order a snot sandwich after all🙂
