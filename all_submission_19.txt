A bird flew in my window, sh*t on my laptop, and decided to die right in front of me. How's your day going?

$C: they say it's good luck when a bird shits on you, but bad luck when it dies in your house. pretty sure you're even stevens in this case.
$C: Does this make you an official Disney Villian?
$C: I see you got my message.
$C: Sounds like you’re having a better day than the bird. 
$C: Beautiful plumage, the Norwegian Blue...
$C: hide, dont leave your house, dont answer the door or phone, be like a person shaped hole in the universe
$C: Ah the new twitter notifications. 
$C: I mean there’s days I wanna shit on my keyboard and die. This bird had the balls to do it. 
$C: [Serious] Call animal control. Usually if a bird just up and dies like that, it's carrying some form of disease. Let them test it. 
$C: That's a bad omen.
$C: Call your county health department. They may ~~wavy~~ want to collect the bird and see if it was carrying West Nile.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Nah he's just stunned. Beautiful plumage
$C: That's an omen if I've ever seen one 
$C: "Hey, how are you doing?"

"I'm having a real bird crashing into my window shitting on my laptop and dying in front of me kind of day."

"Been there."
$C: Flew through a window just to hit windows
$C: You should call animal control to have it inspected. 
$C: I would check your house for carbon monoxide levels. 
$C: Hopefully your anti-virus protects from bird flu.
$C: Be sure to call your local health department, and don't handle the bird! Might be west nile
$C: Poor lil bird. 
$C: Your the opposite of a Disney princess. 
$C: dead for sure? hitting something can be shock. throw it in a shoebox for a while it might wake up.

Edit - speak of the devil. A crow flew into my window. Well c if he make it.

$C: My day is shitty. It is dead around here. But at least it is flying by. 
$C: I flew through a window, shit on some poor sap's laptop, then died while he just stared at me. 
$C: Dude, you got a Dell.
$C: I suspect fowl play.
$C: Wen nite is near

and day is done

Am flying round

an having fun

but when I tri

to fly thru glass

I hit my hed

and fall on ass

I look to hide

and see a shelf

I tri to fly

but shit myself

I tri to leave

fore human came

but he see all

I die of shame.




$C: So really, the bird decided to shit on someone before dying, that's understandable.  


$C: Good comparing to you
$C: Not good. I just found out what happened to my sick pet bird that flew away last night!
$C: You and the girl whose boyfriend took her toilet should get together for a drink. Her ex stole her toilet...

You're both having shitty days.
$C: Yup. Yup. Yup

Whatcha got here is the start of the zombie apocalypse.

I'm gonna need you to _not_ eat that bird and go ahead and burn that laptop just to be safe.  Keep the fire burning though, you may need it later. If'n you start to show symptoms (groaning,  shambling, hunger for branez)   you're gonna want to throw yourself into it.  Its the neighborly thing to do.


$C: I see bird poop on the table side also. I think this one was either sick or poisoned. Normally such a scenerio is coupled with diarrhea and I think it was searching for a warm surface. I assume your laptop was warm.
$C: Ah, the Northeastern Foo. Known throughout the world for it's tendency to defecate and die. In some cultures, people fashion the excrement into ornate jewelry as a symbol of status within their community. This is the basis for the common saying, "If the Foo shits, wear it."
$C: This is like something that would happen at the beginning of a horror movie. OP, let us know how your week goes...

Also, RIP poor birdie.
$C: Dude your caption is like the greatest stand-up comic intro ever. You made me go “hahahahahahahaahahahah”

Thank you.
$C: How likely are you to recommend windows 10 to a friend?
$C: Just came from traffic court where I had to pay $200 and got home to learn that the power was shut off because my roommate didn't pay the one house bill he was responsible for. I pay water internet and cable. 

But when I read this I started laughing out loud. 
$C: Bluebird of Crappyness
$C: F
$C: Id be getting out of that house right quick. Do you feel tired all the time and coffee can't even squash it? Because that's carbon monoxide.
$C: I'd be careful, that bird was probably sick.  Wear some gloves or use a bag to dispose of it!
$C: When the bluebird of happiness keels right in front of you, it’s maybe time to re-evaluate your life choices. 
$C: This made me laugh a disproportionate amount
$C: Did you try turning it off and on again?
$C: Press F to pay respects
$C: I'm pretty sure you can legally go home with pay after that happens. 
$C: That bird may have died from something like the Nile Virus. You need to dress with appropriate PPE, disinfect the literal shit out of everything, and bring the bird to the Dept of Agri for testing.
$C: Well, this is gonna be a longer story than it needs to be, but that's just cause I want to get the details down:

I just went to get on the C train and two E trains came by (don't go to Brooklyn.) The second E train didn't open its doors or leave the station. Everyone started getting pissed. This guy next to me was just repeating over and over "I'm from Marcy son. What up?" and then wondering aloud why the train wasn't opening the doors or talking about how shit the MTA is (it's pretty bad right now.) I saw an MTA employee walking from car to car with a flashlight looking confused. Finally they opened the doors and started talking to people. I asked another man what happened; he said someone pulled the brake (emergency.) So we're all confused and looking around but the two MTA guys say we're gonna be pulling out shortly: "We're just gonna have a look around and see if there's anything going on on the platform." 

The doors half open and a couple with a baby is having trouble getting their carriage out of a half open door. The wife is fine but the guy is pissed. A bystander gets the MTA workers attention right as soon this guy gets the carriage through and then grabs his own water bottle and angrily throws it on the ground. The wife goes, "what's your problem?" It's a couples fight. He says something unintelligible like "I just ugh fuckin!ugh" and she looks at him half-embarrassed and half-pissed saying, "that's _our_ water bottle." He doesn't even respond: just gives that 1000 yard stare. 

At this point the MTA guys are looking at the connection between the two cars and there's a crowd behind them a few feet. One of the metal coils that connects the two cars is partly broken and they're lifting it up and down to see what happened. They start pointing their flashlights and looking into the tracks below. One of them in the orange jacket points down to what was probably right in front of the left car's first wheel and says, "look there's a guy!" kind of like it's so unbelievable that he can't even muster up the dramatic delivery necessary to make sure people believe him. It doesn't matter, though, cause he isn't lying. Im still not sure he said it (thought I misheard?) but everyone's crowding around so I take a peek myself and see a silver of what looks like white cargo shorts. The MTA guys are already rushing to call it in and maybe 10 people are looking with no supervision. I get my phone out to turn on the flashlight but I'm not close enough to get any light. Some other people have flashlights out and I see the whole cargo shorts, but you can't get a look at anything else. I just kind of assumed that I was looking at only half a body, and if I were to get down and really point my flashlight I'd see the other half cut clean, or maybe the head smashed under the wheels. I kind of wanted to check, but I figured people might think I look weird. At this point pretty much everyone around has realized what happened and backed away besides one dude who got a good look with his flashpoint. He gets up and I ask him, "is he dead?" The guy doesn't respond. I ask him again. The guy sort of gives me a vague response that I interpret as a yes, but I don't know if he spoke English. I start walking away with him and he meets a woman I assume was his wife, who rapidly interrogates him in Spanish. It's been a long time since my Spanish classes but she asked him something about a photograph. Fotografia was the only word I distinctly heard (and if there's one lesson here it's that my ears aren't as good as they used to be.) I think she either asked him why he took a photo or if he took a photo, but regardless the guy didn't want to talk about it and he immediately responded with a blunt, mumbled, negative sentence. His wife didn't like that and kept interrogating. 

We were walking by others further down the track who were still waiting and I just motioned to a guy to start walking with a look on my face that he probably thought meant "the annoying MTA fucked up again." I did it again to a second guy waiting and he asked me what happened. I just said, "there was a jumper."
EDIT: I forgot that at this time a child ran right by me (on the yellow line) straight towards the incident, his mother running behind him and brother behind her. I tried to tell her to stop him but they were far away before I processed exactly what they were about to see, how old they were, and the traumatizing effect this could have on them.
The guy kept walking with me for a bit and then asked, "was it a suicide?" I nod and say, "I think so." I wish I had waited to see it out but I just left cause I didn't think there was gonna be much to see. I moved past the turnstiles and a guy asked this woman that was looking into the station why she was waiting. "They're gonna pull out of the station soon," she says. I just shake my head and tell her the same thing I told the other guy, "there was a jumper." It takes her a second. 

We all walk out and I get about half a block away before I see/hear a fire truck. Impressive response time honestly. I talked to an NYC firefighter about this a few years ago. For those who don't know, the fire department deals with subway jumpers because of the electrical element. He told me that subway jumpers were the most fucked up of all things he'd ever seen. The wheels get so hot that they cut clean through and cauterize the wound immediately, meaning that some jumpers stay alive for long periods of time afterwards.

Now that I think about it, though, I doubt the guy was actually dead. The brake was pulled and he must have pulled it. That means he stopped the train and then got down into the tracks. I bet it was some kind of suicidal cry for help, and I kind of hope I had stayed to see it through to the end. It was a pretty wild situation though.
$C: It's not dead, it's resting.
$C: Obviously it's because you're running Windows 10.

That's a "Feature".
$C: My cat would consider this a sign of an *excellent* day indeed.
$C: Its just like that melissa Etheridge song. 🎵come through my window, shit and die by the light of the moon🎵
$C: You'll need a priest, a rabbi, a shaman, an imam, a few medicine men and women, some monks and practitioners of the pagan religions. Because you clearly pissed off some god, so might as well make sure you take all channels to apologize.
$C: That’s how I want to go out. Take the most glorious shit and pass into the unknown in some strangers lap.
$C: The fuck....?
$C: Shitty.
$C: Dwight,is this his beak?!?!?
$C: That looks like the blue bird of happiness.  OP... I would sell that laptop.
$C: He was courteous enough to not get any between the keys.  Pretty easy cleanup.  Also, did he *really*?
$C: *A bird flew in my Windows 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Look at it this way, at least you're not the dead bird.
$C: I suspected Dell was  a Shitty laptop , now I know.
$C: Probably saw porn and had a heart attack 
$C: Damn.... I think twitter crashed. Haha.
$C: Bird shit and a dead bird? Use CCleaner. 
$C: This is the greatest goddamn thing I have ever seen. 
$C: The classic windows 10 experience
$C: OP, give us an update when this bird gets tested. Is it carrying disease? Is it chemical (like DDT)? 
$C: Sad story time: I live in one of the driest captial cities in Australia. One winter a couple of years back we had a torrential downpour. It's usual to have flooding rains in winter, but not so much in my particular area. 

I saw a Greater Sulfur Crested Cookatoo in the backyard, on the ground, walking around and getting drenched. I have put wild bird seed out for the local birds before, and so a cockatoo on the ground during heavy rain is particularly unusual behaviour, as they are big birds and getting wet will make them a target for predators like cats and foxes.

I went out to check on it. Now the cockatoos here are social, but not tame, so if you get too close, they'll fly off. This one didn't. That's when knew something was very wrong. Close inspection, I could see his beak was broken and deformed and his head was missing a lot of feathers.

I put on some heavy gardening gloves and got a towel and a cardboard box, and picked him up. They do bite, so if you are ever forced to rescue a large parrot, you need some seriously heavy duty gloves or your fingers will take a beating. 

I drove him down to the vets, and unfortunately he had Beak and Feather which is highly contagious and at his stage, fatal for the bird. They had to put him down.

I named myself after his legacy. It's a sad thing to see the disease in action in the wild, especially knowing these birds are highly intelligent and can live for 40 years or more in the wild, up to 80 in captivity. Sadly, a life cut short by a wasting disease.

Make sure you throw that thing in the garbage.
$C: Well OP, our 15 year old dog is sick so to ease her suffering we plan to have her put down, go through a week of emotional hell, show up today and they tell is our vet called in sick...😔
$C: [Relevant ](https://youtu.be/4vuW6tQ0218) 
$C: What’s up? Just getting here before this is the top post of all time. 
$C: It tried to fly through the window but couldn't, because Windows is locked
$C: If you weren't running Windows he wouldn't have run into it. 
$C: Looks like he slammed the bird shut along with the laptop too.
$C: I'm a professional psychic/future teller and what the burd dying means is that death is coming for you. But when you add the bird shiting first before dying this means you will eat bad Mexican food and experience great pain.
$C: Bluebird of crappiness.
$C: How did you know he was dead? Did you check his pulse? YOU'RE NOT A VETERINARIAN, YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
$C: “In news this morning president Donald trump has ordered his tweets be delivered by actual birds. The service seems to have major disruption today as the majority of the service carriers committed suicide rather than work for trump.”
$C: r/natureismetal????
$C: What is the air speed velocity of an unlaidened swallow?
$C: That can't be good.

Its like you got expelled from the Walmart version of Hogwarts.
$C: I'm so so sorry to laugh at death but... this is the funniest thing I've seen all day thank you 😂
$C: There’s a Linux or Blue screen of death joke in here somewhere.
$C: Sounds like the bird had a perfect day. My days are never perfect because I’m too much of a pussy to actually kill myself at the end of the day. That bird is goals, honestly.
$C: Welcome to the club. 

Tried to save a lonely border collie on the highway last weekend super late at night. Parked in the emergency lane, got out to get it into my car just to see another car plow straight through it a couple of meters from me. Tried to help but it was twitching a few times and died right in front of me. 

It's been 72hrs, I still feel traumatized :/
$C: I just bought 1200 Sq feet of flooring that came loose and spilled all over a busy highway. 
$C: Birds can instantly die via heart attack from fear. It's likely you scared the shit out of it and then it died.
$C: a little birdie told me windows has a new update that's shit
$C: Have fun being an outbreak monkey for the next bird flu
$C: You got you an indigo bunting right there.
$C: I was awoken around 5:00 AM EST by one of the blades from my ceiling fan breaking at the metal arm and flying straight into my face. I woke up thinking I was under attack.
$C: Dont lie... it scared you, you punched it, it pooped, then died. 
$C: Is this like a reverse Disney princess? 
$C: I'm jealous of the bird
$C: It's the internet sweetie. You're allowed to swear here.
$C: Here's a fun fact! If a bird vomits on you it means they love you! They are sharing their resources just like they do with their young. This doesn't apply to vultures though, who have extremely acidic stomachs. If they vomit on you then you pissed them off. 
$C: Same
$C: Are you by chance working in a mine?
$C: This has to be some sort of curse. 
$C: It had 1 shit left to give.
$C: Crazy how nature do dat
$C: I was driving around in my truck yesterday and I heard a hissing sound. Pull over. The torch that I had in the back of the truck had fallen over turned on and lit a bag full of books on fire. I pulled the flaming bag out in the middle of the street and onlookers from the physical therapy suite next to me were asking if I needed a fire extinguisher. My son was sitting in the passenger seat unable to do anything, he just stared. I hope today is better for you.
$C: Compared to the bird I think you're having a pretty decent day
$C: Hey, I have that Desktop Wallpaper too.
$C: How I feel at work most days...
$C: so, are you a disney villain?
$C: Dee, you bitch!
$C: Better than the bird's. Keyboard still works, too. 
$C: It probably inhaled too much marker fumes, poor thing.
$C: I could only wish that my day was going this well.
$C: Have you tried turning off and on again?
$C: I don’t believe in bad omens but this can’t be a good sign 
$C: It’s a comment on Windows 10. 
$C: You're going to eat that old blue jay burger?
$C: I mean... it's worse for the bird
$C: Windows 10 is shit then. Bird screen of death. 
$C: Wash carefully, use disinfectant wipes....avian flu...
$C: Are you in the States? Looks like it may an immature male indigo bunting. 
$C: You're going to Hogwarts!
$C: Poor birb
$C: Did you try turning it off then back on?
$C: I mean the bird looks kinda flat, are you sure you didn’t literally and figuratively squish the shit out of it.
$C: Buy a lottery ticket 
$C: OP, Go to your local soothsayer. Give him the bird. He will slice it open and examine the entrails. He will tell you your future.
$C: I use windows 10, so the shit on the computer isn’t as bad as the shit in it. Also Dell fucked me on the processor. 
$C: LOL
$C: u/hossamlatif tole3 fi 7ada yawmo absha3 mene😂
$C: Same feel, different set of circumstances.
$C: I work in fast food. One day in the kitchen the cook started screaming, and I looked over and saw a gray blur on the burger grill. She thought it was a rat, but I saw it was actually a bird. I have NO idea why, but somehow a bird flew in and decided to just land on the grill. It must have instantly cooked its feet, because they were all curled up and it couldn't use them anymore. I put it in a box and tried to calm it down, but it died a couple hours later. What the hell?
$C: Dude, buy a lottery ticket
$C: Pretty good...but my bird flew away today.
$C: Hey, so...don't touch that burd without gloves.
$C: I need to come up with 950$ in 2.5 hours or my apartment is going to evict my girlfriend and I 👌
$C: Mike pence is in town so if i want to go anywhere in my car right now it's going to take  7x as long. But other than that, good thanks. 
$C: It probably died because it landed on your filthy keyboard
$C: Seriously that's some end of days shit. You wanna buy a suit of armor, or a beach chair to watch it all burn either way, good luck...
$C: That's what happens when you kill the cow king.
$C: I wanna go out like that.
$C: Gone with the shit. 
$C: Died waiting for Windows 10 updates
$C: I shit on dells also!!
$C: Birds of a feather, Should have bought a Lenovo.

$C: Maybe it just REALLY doesn't like Dell..
$C: OP just got the latest bird flu. RIP. 
$C: Your twitter has a virus
$C: Looks more like a homicide

$C: Shouldn't this be tagged as NSFW? I really feel like it should
$C: What the heck kind of porn were you watching??!
$C: I’d call it a day man. Canary in a coal mine, amiright?  You ain’t supposed to be working on that project any more. 
$C: Twitter update for your windows laptop.
$C: Peter griffen is that you? I see the twitter update is coming along nicely.
$C: Got paid yesterday and today I only have $2 for the rest of the month....
$C: Poor thing just thought the screen was Windows.
$C: Your day could be worse. You could be the bird. 
$C: Mr McNamara is that you?
$C: Did I wake up this morning thinking we’d be having a funeral for a bird? You can never tell what your day here is going to turn into. 
$C: So you’re going to sell it to a blind kid, right?
$C: plot twist: he killed the birdo for shitting on his laptop
$C: I think there's a Windows 10 security update that fixes this problem.
$C: First vacation in 3 years, rented a car in Spain, car broken into all luggage, passports, Nintendo switch all stolen US consulate closed for local holiday had to cancel second leg of Trip because of our lost passports stuck in Spain till all this gets sorted... 
$C: That is a shitty laptop , I guess the bird knew it too.
$C: Since this is reddit:

Pretty sure this is how global pandemics or zombie apocalypse start, OP.    

You're probably already infected but you may as well start stocking up on food and shotgun shells just in case you survive being patient zero.
$C: That's what you get for owning a Dell.
$C: On a serious note. Thoroughly disinfect your laptop and work area. That was a sick animal and you don't know what it brought in work it. Probably nothing but better safe than sorry. 
$C: I guess you didn't get into Hogwarts.
$C: That computer is a piece of shit. 
$C: RT: "Shit happens, then you die."
$C: Is the laptop and bird for sale? I guess it won’t be going cheep..
$C: Better than the bird's
$C: Cause of death: flew into Windows
$C: I’m sorry but that shit would not fly with me 
$C: So youre saying this ***is not*** how to send a tweet to a friend?
$C: Toriama noooooo
$C: I’m on vacation so pretty good, thanks.
$C: Appears the bird flew in your window with the intention of shitting on your Windows (10)
$C: I see the president has sent another tweet. 
$C: LMFAO I JUST SNORTED MY DRINK OUT MY NOSE IN A STARBUCKS 
$C: Have you tried putting it in rice?
$C: >Flew into my windows

FTFY
$C: r/wellthatsucks
$C: In case you're curious that's an old school tweet. 
$C: Uhhh...bird flu??!! Likely cause, it's contagious.
$C: This is now my favorite reddit post
$C: I would laugh at this, but if i laugh again my piece of shit boss will yell at me again for making noise. 
$C: They say that’s good luck
$C: If this was a canary I would say stay away from your lap top.
$C: "What are your thoughts?" Asked the reddit comment box. Well, let me list them in order:

"A bird flew through my window"-Hm, that could be nice, or it could wreak total havoc.

",sh\*t on my laptop"-Well...this can only go down hill from here...

",and decided to die right in front of me."-Well...that's unique.

"How's your day going?"-You know. That's very considerate of you despite this unfortunate event. My day is going quite well. My windows are closed though...So no dead birds here.
$C: since other ppl posted all the funny responses, all I have left to say is (on a serious note) watch out for parasites. small animals that do this are usually infected with parasites that want to spread to a new host.
$C: Other than that, Mrs Lincoln, how was the play?
$C: As someone with a pet bird, this is horrifying. We've already lost one to an accident and the idea of losing my second would very nearly kill me.

That being said, these are some of the funniest comments I've ever seen, and I have no doubt that I will be going to bird hell.
$C: Pretty much sums up Dells support
$C: Yeah, I've heard about some problem with birds and Windows.
$C: It shat tight on the power button. That bird gave its life to protect you from the Windows 10 update. R.I.P. 
$C: Sell it to a blind kid for a few bucks and buy a bag of chips
$C: I'm scared of dead birds. Oh my god I'm so sorry. How is this even....
$C: You killed the Bluebird of Happiness.  I hope you're happy with yourself.
$C: Should probably upgrade to the newest version of Windows.
$C: "mom! I think I got a got a message from a higher power!"

"From God!?"

"Not really no"
$C: Maybe it died cause it flew into your Windows..
$C: I believe they call that a shitty tweet.
$C: I stole vitamins and a rain suite from w@lmart just to exchange ultimately for some weed to take the edge off of living in a shelter...how was your day?
$C: "witness me"
$C: Your day is going well much better than that birds
$C: It was just pissed you're still using Windows 8.
$C: Dude that’s a bad sign. You better pray.  Give it a proper ceremony. 
$C: OP must be a monster, scared the shit out of that bird. Hope you are happy with yourself, you fucking savage. 
$C: Mmmm not that bad! Thanks for making my day look gooood!
$C: Did you get that thing I sent ya Birdman?
$C: That was a fowl thing to do.  
$C: What old gypsy woman did you piss off?
$C: I'd say you're having a better day than that bird. 
$C: It died of disappointment to see you're using Windows 10.
$C: Better than the bird.
$C: Use gloves. That fucker could have parasites is why.
$C: All my classes are full in community college. Im stuck in another state and the classe I was able to sign up starts in 2 days and payment is today. 

So you know; shit as usual. 
$C: What did you scribble out so desperately?
$C: Hogwarts is making massive budget cuts, I see. 
$C: Decapitated. Whole big thing. We had a funeral for a bird.
$C: It’s not every day you bear witness to a living things final shit.
$C: Those new update notices are hard to ignore 
$C: I have the same laptop and background. Does this mean I'm...next? 
$C: Didn't you give bird mouth to beek?
$C: I bet you killed the bird for shitting on your laptop, didn't you... you murderer....
$C: He hit your window and landed on your window
$C: That's what you get for buying a dell
$C: He died doing what he loved. RIP Birb. 
$C: My day’s not so great, I flew into some guy’s window, took a shit on his laptop, then fucking died. 

Worst day of my life. 
$C: That's the Blue Bird of Happiness! Lucky you!
$C: Youre like the anti-snow white
$C: You’re like an anti-Disney Princess
$C: Holy shit?! Are you serious 
$C: Holy shit.
$C: So far not as bad as the bird's
$C: Currently broke down on side of road, cant be in my house because of infestation of bed bugs that my mother in law brought over, my daughter is due any minute. Yeah great week so far.
$C: Call tech support..... they’ll love this! 
$C: What were you watching that made a bird want to kill itself......?
$C: I been feeling suicidal for the past week and this lifted my spirits. Greatly.
$C: > You can't get diseases from a bird!

Michael Scott
$C: Pretty good I had Burger King 🙂
$C: That poor bastard also painted your stuff black before dying too apparently
$C: The glass window barely stunned the bird, it was Windows 10 that made the bird sh*t itself and drop dead.
$C: I, I just died on your keys today. 🎵
$C: Better than the dead fucking bird's day, man. 
$C: Uuuh I feel like this belongs in r/WTF
$C: r/wellthatsucks
$C: I have long waited to see a post over 100k and you crushed it
$C: He was trying to warn you.

Pack a bag and get out of town til things cool off.
$C: r/nevertellmetheodds
$C: Yesterday, the vet called and told me they gave me the wrong dead body. I had a funeral for some lady’s cat. So I dug up the dead cat, Took it to the vet, and buried my dog for real that time. I dunno, your day might be weirder. 
$C: Considerably better in comparison, thank you!
$C: Your laptop is now ground zero for the next flu pandemic that will wipe out two thirds of the world's population. 
$C: As omens go your screwed
$C: I feel so horrible but I’m crying from laughing
$C: Looks like it was trying to fly through your Windows...
$C: Bro..thats definitely a bad sign. Walk around final destination style for the next week or two!
$C: I'm pretty sure this is the very same bird that stood on Bernie Sanders shoulders during the election campaign!!!   
$C: I feel the same way after seeing that Dell
$C: At least you’re not the fuckin bird ahahaha 
$C: I would be concerned that the bird was so desperate to give me an important message that he literally killed himself trying to get to me in time
$C: Dell is getting really dark with their advertising...
$C: Maybe that's a sign to get a Mac...

That way windows won't be an issue ;) 
$C: That's what you get for downloading Twitter.
$C: Like a fucking ~~rockstar~~ sqwakstar 
$C: This makes me really sad because I love animals and have birds :(
$C: Windows can’t be trusted
$C: It is awful when birds fly into Windows.
$C: Have you tried turning it off and on again?
$C: Around age 12 I heard a loud bang on one of my windows. I went outside to investigate. I found a very dazed hummingbird on my deck so I picked him up. It was breathing heavily and looked very dazed. A moment later I realized that it’s breathing had stopped. I was pretty traumatized at the time. 
$C: I'd suggest using gloves to clean and disenfect that. I'm no expert but that scenario feels like the beginning of every plague apocalypse movie ever. 
$C: Got dropped off 20 miles from home(i was supposed to get a ride back) and might be kicked out due to the inability of the other tenant to properly communicate.
$C: in case it hasn't been mentioned....might want to check with your local health authorities... it is mosquito season and possible [West Nile victim](https://i.imgur.com/HRL3NL5.png)
$C: Sorry my carrier bird was exhausted from flying to the wrong addresses I kept giving it. Finally made it and was all pooped out. 
$C: He was trying to get into another window.  Too bad it was Windows 10.
$C: Yeah, I'd make sure that bird didn't die of anything that can bridge the species gap... I'd call a pet hospital or vet to see what they'd recommend doing. 
$C: Did you.. get that thing I sent you?
$C: How did it get in? Your Windows look locked. 
$C: That's good luck!
$C: Well I flew to Cleveland today and a 450lb lady with scabs alllll over her arms and who smelled like moldy cheese sat next to me on a full flight and sweated all over me, so yeah just about as shitty as yours.
$C: Maybe because you are using Windows 10?
$C: That’s how I want to go out. Take the most glorious shit and pass into the unknown in some strangers lap.
$C: The bird decided to let you know his opinion about you  running win 10....
$C: Sell the bird to the blind kid down the street and head for Aspen! 
$C: Op, did you kill a bird and force excrement onto your laptop for karma?
$C: At least it didn’t shit on (& between) the keys. 
$C: Better than that bird’s day
$C: This is the best and most random post to Reddit ive seen in a while. I love you 
$C: This post has repost protection until August 14th falls on a Tuesday again.
$C: I had a 20 pound turkey fly through my large closed window.  Explosion out of nowhere, glass shards flying in every direction. A few gobbles, and then he died. Bobcat sitting outside wondering if he should hop in for his lunch.  So when something crappy happens, someone always has a story of something even crappier!
$C: well it is a Dell.. the bird knew it was shit..

$C: Too bad it forgot to draw a portrait of itself with its sh*t right before he went 
$C: Burp .....morty get your shit we got stuff to do.
$C: Poor little thing. It’s only a baby. Little bluebird. :c
$C: Its the birds way of telling you to get a MacBook Pro instead of this Dell junk :p
$C: OP murdered a bird and smeared it's shit all over his laptop for karma.

Bet.
$C: You should have closed it's eyes slowly like in the movies.
$C: It seems to me that the odds of that happening would be pretty low. You probably could have used that luck to win the lottery. 
$C: Aww, goddamn dude! Don't leave your house today...
$C: "Windows 10 new update"
$C: This Regular Show reboot is looking great!
$C: Ewwww disease, diseases everywhere.  
$C: Most original post of 2018 award goes to...
$C: Lolollolololol wtf
$C: Can’t complain.
$C: \> sprays chrome on beak

\> "witness me!"
$C: Wow Windows 10 features just get worse and worse.
$C: i'm guessing the bird died from seeing piece of shit windows 10
$C: Apparently  if a bird gets in the house, it means someone close to you is going to die soon. Can't imagine what "bird gets in the house, poops and dies" means, though.
$C: Gives you an excuse to get rid of that lappy from 2009
$C: If you wanna break 200k on this post, the bird needs to have kicked a smack habit, lost a substantial amount of weight, or some such. 
$C: Windows and the bird screen of death
$C: YOU are NOT a Disney princess...
$C: This is what happens when you use “windows”!!!
$C: When you gotta go, you got to go.
$C: "Hahahahahahahaha.. you owe me five bucks Kyle!"
$C: OP set this up with roadkill and mustard to cash in on those sweet yet savory internet points or I'm a jaywalking donkey in a fishbowl.
$C: The users responsible for the top comments on this post need to quit their jobs and try stand up comedy. I have been way too entertained for way too long. Must. get. stuff. done.
$C: What a shitty Tweet.  #shittytweet
$C: Poor bird :(
$C: I guess windows frustrates animals too!
$C: #Praise be to the newest Champion of Reddit, u/JaMollyAdams!

[Let us not forget the Champions of yore...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChampionsOfReddit/)
$C: You won’t get the role as a Disney princess. 
$C: The bird just died?  After violating your property?
You mind coming downtown?  We have more questions.

$C: I know a great bird lawyer if you need one. 
$C: The end of Twitter.
$C: Well, it IS a Dell..
$C: This is an indigo bunting. Quite rare!
$C: Looks like you smashed it in your laptop, forcing its last poop out. 
$C: It's a Dell, well deserved.
$C: I parked my car at my work, shit in the bathroom, and am slowly dying inside. If anything I relate to the bird more than I think. 
$C:  Guess the bird just wanted to Shitpost at least once  before he died  :p 
$C: This post actually stands a chance at being the most upvoted Reddit post *of all time*.
$C: I think this means you're going to have a bad harvest.
$C: Ha, not cover by warranty 
$C: You kept fapping while the bird was crapping and then stopped flapping.
$C: He probably had an aneurysm trying to use Windows 10
$C: Hey OP, I've been having a horrible past few days and this gave me a laugh. Sorry for your misfortune, but just know you helped out at least one stranger by posting this.
$C: What a way to stop tweeting.
$C: That's what you get for using Windows. 
$C: If it were me I’d be looking for a new computer 
$C: Sums up my experience with Dell.
$C: What's more concerning is the possibility of OP faking this by squeezing the actual shit out of a bird then murdering it on their laptop.
$C: Scared shitless
$C: I think you should buy a screen for your window. I believe west nile virus(one of many) is transmitted by sick birds . Did it try to fly through your screen or just drop dead? I've seen small birds hit windows and look dead . Gently picking them up, cupping them in your hands and lightly breathing on them sometimes brings them back . I had one little song bird who after he woke up didn't want to leave my finger he was perched on. 
$C: This made my day
$C: Mayday, this is Bluebird, roger, code white and sticky, I repeat, code white and sticky, we are going down
$C: This is this month’s most upvoted post on reddit. Congratulations!
$C: My day is going quite well thanks for asking
$C: /r/hmmm
$C: Juvenile Eastern Bluebird? Poor guy
$C: Can anyone tell me why this post has over 184k upvotes but their profile has only 26k karma??
$C: I think the bird had a rougher day than you.. poor fellow..
$C: Well it is a Dell
$C: Looks look like lunch just flew in the window!
$C: You have brought joy to my day with your post. Thank you 
$C: A lot better now that I’ve seen this!
$C: That’s hilarious. My day just became better thanks
$C: 😂🤣 this really cracked me up, so funny. A “did this really just happen” moment, I can imagine your reaction and that makes me laugh too! 
$C: This reminds me of the time a bird shit all over my car. Won't be giving her a lift again 
$C: Looks like your Windows has stopped working.
$C: Was it heart beating, Toby? Did you check it? No, of course you didn’t. You’re not a veterinarian. You don’t know ANYTHING! 
$C: Take that, Mr bluebird of happiness. Not so chirpy now, huh? 
$C: I'm just imagining what you did that was so wrong that the world decided to do you dirty like this? I mean, this is some planned shit. God exists and he is mocking us.
$C: And the worst part of it all: windows 10
$C: My stepbrother was just run over by a truck next to me. The day after we celebrated his 30th birthday. He was more of a brother than a brother and I loved him so much. So, really fucking shitty thanks for asking.
$C: Blue represents MANA, eat it....QUICK and then bolt to beat your bosses ass. This is a gift from the gamer gods.
$C: Ah, a passed example of avian flew.
$C: Other users in this thread are telling you that you've experienced an evil omen.

Don't listen to them. What you've experienced is a standup comedy bit waiting to be told.

>Have you ever just had one of those days? You know the ones: Right from the moment when you wake up, you just know that something stupid is going to happen? Like, maybe you'll go to get a drink of water, and you'll get kicked in the ass by a six-year-old psychopath wearing a *Pokémon* T-shirt.
>
>That probably sounds pretty specific, huh?
>
>Really, though, think about it! What do you do in that situation? You're standing there with a sore ass, and you can't very well go complaining about it. How would that sound? "Uh, yeah, a random kid made my ass hurt." You can't yell at him, because then the kid's mother will get involved, and... look, it's just a bad situation all around.
>
I had one of those days recently. Not with a kid, mind you. No, see, I woke up one morning, and I could tell that my day wasn't going to go well. Naturally, I decided to stay home... which turned out to be a big mistake. I sit down, I get out my laptop, and I start getting to work... when all of a sudden, this bird comes flying in my window.
>
>Now, my first thought was that I'd become a Disney princess. Let me tell you, though, this was like no Disney movie you've ever seen: The bird just looks up at me, makes this annoyed-sounding noise, then shits at all over my laptop. I'm talking "Taco Bell during a night of heavy drinking" shit. Then, as this bird is staring me *right* in the eye... it just keels over and dies. Just dies. Dead. So, now I have a dead bird to deal with, in addition to some literal shit.
>
>Frankly, I would have rather been kicked in the ass.

$C: How did it die?
$C: My day's going better than the bird's.
$C: Well coincidentally...
$C: Behold the last poop. Praise jebes.
$C: What happens when your soulmate was incarnated as a short-lived bird while you were incarnated as an office drone. 
$C: Life telling you to "fuck off and die" has lost all of its subtly.
$C: my day is going great!
$C: Think we're all doing better than the bird. 
$C: Oh no
$C: Well in this scenario, I’d be the laptop
$C: You should be honored, the bird decided to take his last sh*t by your side ^^
$C: That's considered good luck in parts of China!
$C: Not as bad as bird's day apparently. 
$C: OMG,, every time I move into a new place I find a dead bird, in garage or anywhere. It always creeps me out
$C: F
$C: This plot will never fly.
$C: Give him cpr
$C: Be honest though, thats not the worst thing thats been sprayed onto the keyboard, is it?
$C: ...ok there are some missing chunks in this story that I feel are integral to this story so I feel bad and stop laughing until I cry. 

(Not for the dead bird, that is sad, however he went out like a fucking legend)
$C: Pretty good. 
$C: Bad luck man.
$C: Well I haven't just been exposed to bird flu, so I'd say it's going ok.
$C: I relate more with the bird today tbh
$C: I would go fishing and use it as bait.
$C: What a way to go........
$C: Maybe ur the reincarnation of that dude on final destination... any friends going on a plane named "bird shit death" soon? If so- U gotta warn them. Make sure to do it loudly, in public and with alot of arm waving if poss. GL!
$C: I have an irrational fear of birds and if that happened to me I would have a melt down
$C: I'm an animal lover, like, I like animals *way* more than humans, and while I'm horrified at what happened, I actually laughed out loud. Poor bird. :-( 
$C: This beat my Atticus stiker on my laptop. 
$C: Thats awesome
$C: G7?
$C: ~~Men~~ Birds shit themselves when they die, [didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school](https://youtu.be/ToH6z5gqkIs?t=39s)? 
$C: And a story like that has got to be true.
$C: Well I guess we know what Elvis was reincarnated as!
$C: Wut?
$C: Even Hogwarts suffers from budget cuts.
$C: Man, the world is tryin to tell you somethin.  
$C: Cant make this stuff up😂
$C: Not the first bird to off itself by flying into Windows. It won't be the last, either.
$C: You do realize there are screens on windows for a reason, right?
$C: On behalf of all birds "fuck you, eat my shit."
$C: damn that's one hell of a shit
$C: Well, at least it was a blue bird.
$C: If I knew I was going to die, I'd wipe my shit all over my SOs stuff, so me dying isn't the worst thing they will have to deal with that day.
$C: This is so funny I’m dying I wish I could see your reaction 
$C: you're allowed to swear on the internet
$C: I shit on most E5540s that come across my desk too!
$C: Ok then
$C: You need two more for a Bob Marley song.
$C: This is, this is how I want to go
$C: I was smoking on my back porch and heard a repeated bang on the aluminum roof thing. I walked out from under it and a 5 foot wingspan bird flew off from the tree overhanging my porch. 
About an hour ago. 

... wtf?
$C: Looks like your Hogwarts acceptance letter has arrived!
$C: Well, I'm pretty sure you're not a wizard Harry.
$C: At the DMV. So just about the same. 
$C: Jesus turn your malware protection down. Its on "murder"
$C: Oh the poor bird :(
$C: Worse than you're, Im the bird.
$C: It’s my birthday
$C: Alcohol the shit out of that shit.  If the bird died of a disease, you don't want to get it, too.
$C: Sorry, but I laughed out loud at this 
$C: That's good luck in Haiti.
$C: Pretty well thanks
$C: Better than that bird
$C: My day is about the equivalent of this very same thing happening.
$C: I have the same laptop! But honestly days much better. Sorry bro 
$C: oh COME ON
$C: Warning
$C: Well, I actually just witnessed a hawk tear apart the same species of bird on my street😁
$C: Better than the birds 
$C: At least your day is going better than the bird’s.
$C: Well at least you were shit on, no *in*.
$C: I'm pretty sure it's good luck to get shit on by a bird. So consider yourself captain lucky today?
$C: It's going pretty good thx, I just got a permanent contract and a raise today!
$C: Should have bought a mac.
$C: Better than your day, mate!
$C: Not as bad as that bird's.
$C: Patient zero
$C: I once saw a pigeon fly straight into a glass building. Guess it didnt see the glass. It fell hard onto the sidewalk and died.
$C: Shitty day
$C: Bad, but not that bad.
$C: It knew it was about to die and couldn't make it to your car. Went for the next best option.
$C: At least you didn't break your fibula and tibula in your left leg like me. Glass half full
$C: I would say better than yours, but let's see how it ends
$C: It’s ok to say curse words, the internet cops don’t exist and won’t throw you in jail for saying shit
$C: Do you live near a lumber yard or something similar? The one I used to work at had this birdseed they would leave out that would make the birds act crazy and die. Legit had several birds fall down dead in front of me. 
$C: My day has been weird. Went to the grocery store this morning to re-stock the office kitchen, no bananas. None. Bought milk, it spilled all over the back seat of my car and on my pants. Good news is the Starbucks barista didn't dilute my cold brew, so when I got to work I poured half into another cup and added the water myself. So technically a free coffee? Went to run errands on my lunch break, bought some body wash which was also open slightly. Spilled all over the other stuff in the bag (and my hands), but at least it was just soap? Maybe it'll counter-act the milk smell? 

Also, I fuckin' hate birds.
$C: This was a sentence I never thought I would read.
$C: That's how I fell about Dell's as well. 
$C: Missing an s, "Bird flew into my Windows..."
$C: That bird shit the keyboard, in every way possible. Bless up!
$C: Where are his feet?
$C: I bet that bird has a stomach full of plastic =(
$C: on my bus commute this morning the guy sitting next to me spilled his beer all over and it smelled like stale warm beer. Then once I got off the bus there was a woman without any shoes on, covered in dried blood... freaking head to toe asking for a cigarette. Then a few hours later I saw two guys shooting up in a park while I was walking between my work sites....

yeah its been one of those days and its not even noon!
$C: OP killed the bird!
$C: I assume you are still having a better day than that bird.
$C: Is that a blue jay? 
$C: well... i'm a dodgers fan so, i feel like your laptop.
$C: Poor bird 
$C: /r/NeverTellMeTheOdds 
$C: Never buy a dell
$C: I think your house may be possessed.
$C: There's the problem; it's only Tuesday.
$C: Which divine entity did you pissed off?
$C: He was just dying to get on the computer 
$C: sh\*t dude that s\*cks
$C: So many strange comments. Twillight zone. 
$C: Humm usually when a bird comes to someone he or she is a Disney princess on reddit. Are you the first disney villian on Reddit?
$C: At least your day is going better than the bird... 
$C: I found a dead bird, smeared some mayo on my laptop and posted them on reddit for karma.
$C: That's my exact computer and I had to double check I did not, in fact, post this from the future.
$C: [removed]
$C: I have that same laptop.  On top of all the bad things that just happened to you, your track pad is a piece of garbage.   


I feel for ya man. 
$C: I'm not sure there's any appropriate response to this...
$C: Silver lining, some one gives a shit about you. 
$C: I hope you exercise extreme caution and use the proper PPE while cleaning the bird up. That bird more than likely died of a disease and Are easily transmittable to humans.
$C: What is the air speed velocity of a bird suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning?
$C: Shit!
$C: It shit itself to death
$C: Hey we have the same laptop! Mine is bird free tho so my day is pretty good
$C: For those who care, this looks like a juvenile Western Scrub Jay
$C: What’s the thing above the b? I’ve seen it a number of times
$C: Kiss your Ass Goodbye...

Bird Flu!
$C: Well I’m still alive 
$C: Decapitated. Whole big thing. We had a funeral for a bird.
$C: Dell, the work laptop of... Pretty much everywhere.
$C: New Avian flu. GL Mate!
$C: I feel like this is a very bad omen. 
$C: Too much wildfire smoke.
$C: You don't have screens on your windows?
$C: Eastern Bluebird 
$C: Better than that bird’s day, I guess. 
$C: They make these cool new things called "screens" for windows, FYI.
$C: Free feathers!
$C: I took a 45 minute ride to get groceries and left half my groceries at the butcher shop :(
$C: I feel like this is how the first person is exposed to the next plague.
$C: And then everyone clapped
$C: I thought the bird was flattened by laptops screen
$C: You killed the bluebird of happiness?

$C: Well.. to be fair it \*IS\* a Latitude.
$C: You need to find the old gypsy lady you offended and apologize... **NOW**!
$C: Birds flu maybe? ;)
$C: “In today’s news: bird flys into windows and dies. Now hears Bill with the weather.”
$C: Not as good as yours is going. I still have to catch my dinner for today.
$C: I think it was a suicide.
$C: At least he didn't die alone...
$C: Roll Tide?
$C: Apparently better than yours. 
$C: F
$C: [This pretty much sums up how I feel about my life right now](https://i.imgur.com/2m9Pg1W.mp4)
$C: I guess that's a pretty shitty laptop then
$C: You sure it’s dead? Did you try giving it mouth to mouth? 
$C: r/techsupportgore 
$C: This kills the bird
$C: You probably got avian flu too...
$C: r/wellthatsucks
$C: There was a big fat beetle in the bathroom. Needless to say I'm still holding it.
$C: My puppy died.
$C: I keep telling people the end is coming, looks like nature agrees. I just get ready for the rapture if I were you. 
$C: its a DELL
$C: I'm not sure if this is supposed to be a good or bad omen.
$C: At least you still have your toilet. 
$C: Bird Flu Patient Zero everyone. 
$C: Hogwarts is experiencing some budget cuts.
$C: It’s cause you got a dell.
$C: Thats what you get for buying dell
$C: Strange angle... bird looks flattened
$C: What a terrible sign.
$C: question is...Is that a jackdaw or a crow?
$C: Congrats you are now "officially" an Evil Stepmother 
$C: Fine thanks for asking. 
$C: Hahahaha not bad, thanks for asking.
$C: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I just burst out laughing in the bathroom whilst sitting on the toilet. People are going to think I have issues. 
$C: dude.. you got a dell?!
$C: Xps? 
$C: Lottery Ticket maybe?
$C: Great, because I run Linux, so the bird would be the biggest problem if this happened to my computer.
$C: My day’s not going as good as that birds. 
$C: So far not a single bird in sight....... So i will say it is going good. 😂
$C: I tried reversing and just didnt look in the side mirror. Yes i hit something and it was very sharp and now i have to fix a quarter of my car
$C: Hmmm...I'd say you're screwed, but I'm not fully up to date on my harbingers of doom.
$C: “Cardinal crashed into my window, I think he might have died..”
$C: Dave, we get it, you’re a Mac guy. 


$C: You just can't make this shit up
$C: What sort of messed up porn were you watching? 
$C: gift him to a blind kid
$C: r/wellthatsucks
$C: The fact that this happened to someone and the first thing they did was take a picture lol
$C: Imma do a tarot reading with you in mind brb.

Edit: you got some pretty good cards.

7 of Cups

4 of swords (reversed)

10 of swords (reversed)

From that I gather you will have some sort of victory or success from wise choices. Perhaps from an idea or movement you had or designed.
$C: Holy shit! I got attacked by a bird today too!  I was sleeping in late and I heard chirping by my window a couple feet away.  Didn't think anything of it until its wings flapping against the curtain.  Open it up and somehow it got into my room, despite the screen pannel being shut!  It started panicking and bashing into stuff so I ripped the screen and after a minute or so it flew out.  I've been looking over my window/house since it happened and it still makes no sense.

Here's the weird part, it panic-shat on my keyboard!  Right on the F1/F2 key.  What is happening!?  Are we under attack?
$C: Even birds know that Dells are crap
$C: How I feel when the news covers a Presidential tweet from 3am the night before.  

$C: I bet your day is going better than the bird's.
$C: Better than the birds, to be sure.
$C: Better then the birds. 
$C: Dude, you got a Dell!
$C: A bird shat on me while having lunch. 
$C: It's a sign from above that you seriously need a new laptop. Because holy shit, dude.
$C: Released it's bowels as it died. Seems legit.
$C: Fmd. Did the s%t break keys on the keyboard? Ie they are sticky or don't work right? If so, you can fix it easily.  Takes a few minutes. PM me if so. I'm a computer tech. 
$C: What a way to go. 
$C: Thanks for censoring the word shit, no need for my 3 year old to see profanities while looking at pictures of dead birds!
$C: Dude! He shit on a Dell!
$C: And here I was thinking I was having a bad day just because one of my trailer tires blew and I didn’t have a spare. At least my coworker can run back to our shop and grab me one. You’re just screwed. 
$C: Same. 
$C: Maybe stay at home, indoors, and away from any sketchy looking wires today...just sayin'.
$C: What’s that custard doing on your laptop?
$C: Birds shit themselves when they die. They don't teach you that in fancy ornathology school. 
$C: When I was in 8th grade, a bird flew in through my parents big house fan and died under my bed. My crazy grandma found it when she was cleaning my room and put it in a plastic grocery bag. When I got home from school she said, “I found a dead bird under your bed and I wasn’t sure if you wanted to keep it?????” Gotta love my Nana!!!!!!
$C: it took just a look to your browsing history...

$C: Majestic
$C: dark wings dark words
$C: You must have done something wrong.....
$C: At least your day is better than the bird's
$C: It literally killed itself with how priceless it thought shitting on your laptop was.
$C: I've seen enough pandemic movies to know that you're patient zero in an avian flu outbreak that will kill you and the majority of humanity. 
$C: I wonder how that birds day was going?
$C: It looks smashed. Are you sure that you it didn't die after you've closed your laptop? 
$C: My day is going better than his!
$C: That's exactly how I want to die.
$C: Damn, can i get a rip in the chat.
$C: An omen that your laptop is going to crap out on you?
$C: I shall tweet it!

$C: Everyone keeps commenting on the tarrifs and nails but this administration is lowering many more
$C: https://youtu.be/6bWyhj7siEY
$C: I really hope this isn’t staged 
$C: Get someone to discard of the bird immediately. Clean the laptop fast as well. They carry bird mites which leave the bird when it dies. 
$C: I can hear Katy Perry's 'Last Friday Night' already
$C: About as good as his. :o
$C: You're cursed.
$C: A bird on the Dell is better than two in the bush. 
$C: The pipe over my desk burst and soaked my cube.
$C: I hope you have a bird funeral where Dwight plays his recorder 
$C: You're a pretty shit house Disney Princess I'm afraid. Try to avoid any anthropomorphic table furnishings and under no circumstances should you burst into song without supervision.
$C: Are you an Aussie? Otherwise, why do you have budgies flying in through your windows and dying?
$C: Disney princess status.
$C: That's like a unicorn for a dog 
$C: What a way to go out 
$C: Scared shitless means death in bird. 
$C: An owl did this at my house. It had been poisoned. My asshole neighbor left some D-Con out for mice and the owl hunted the poisoned mice. I would bet this bluebird of unhappiness that died on your electronics was poisoned by something it ate.  
$C: Still alive. Just unconcious
$C: Did you get checked for bird flu?
$C: This bird is NOT dead, he's just resting!
$C: People keep saying carbon monoxide, but it very could be trichomonosis obtained from a bird feeder that hasn't been cleaned in a long time. 
$C: Can we get F for Respects
$C: Lunch time.
$C: Holy shittt
$C: /r/techsupportgore
$C: ‘Tis the ghost of twitter future 
$C: In bird culture, this is considered a dick move...
$C: Japanese kamikaze pilot (colorized circa.1944)
$C: Could have been worse, least he did not steal your toilet
$C: [they just upgraded from this] (https://youtu.be/3h6A3QZX750)





$C: This is how Twitter is letting you know how they updated their Privacy Policy.
$C: One final act of valor 
$C: Allmoust shat myself. 
$C: I opened this and was like “what??” and then said “oh hey we’ve got the same laptop.” lmao.
$C: I'm fairly certain someone has cursed you.
$C: The real tragedy here is that you have a Dell
$C: Oh poor you. How did you survive? 
$C: how the fuck is this not NSFW? why the fuck is this content even allowed?
$C: Hope you aren't in a West Nile virus area, because that's a red flag.
$C: That is very unlucky
$C: Am I the only person that has screens on my windows?
$C: Hello patient zero
$C: How are you going to get the poop out of your computer speakers?

Poor bird. Its poop looks like mayonnaise. 
$C: What if there is an important message for humanity in that poop tho?...
$C: He also shit on windows
$C: just give him a decent grave
$C: We need more posts like this and less progress pics 
$C: At least he dint shit on your keyboard 
$C: Better than yours. Much better than the bird's. 
$C: Or, you squirted some kind of condiment about and then posed the bird your cat left by the front door last night.
$C: Killing a bird for online karma? You’re a psychopath 
$C: Better than that bird's.
$C: A squirrel fell out of a tree and onto me this morning. That was fun.
$C: Pretty good, thanks for asking
$C: At least it didn't tell you to "fuck off"
$C: This is a cover up, nice try.
$C: Gonna eat that? 
$C: Are we sure it’s not just playing dead? This is reddit. 
$C: What about the birds day? 
$C: Duude. You need a new dell
$C: You killed it after it shit on your laptop, didn't you?
$C: The exposition, the climax, and the finale. You just witnessed a play, OP!
$C: This is how I feel today.
$C: It flew into a window(s)... computer
$C: The bird wasn't going on your laptop, it was on the quality of your work.
$C: I hope you’re well versed in Bird Law just incase you get served a lawsuit.
$C: The bird just wanted to say with his dying breath...."dude your getting a dell".
$C: Your day is going better than the birds. 
$C: The shit looks like mayo.
$C: He's not dead, he's stunned.
$C: Well I drank about 3/4 of a box of wine last night so I just woke up and tbh I’ve felt better but I’ve also felt worse. Thanks for asking.
$C: Look on the bright side: It's really unlikely that anything worse will happen to either you or the bird today.
$C: Yeah, but that’s a work laptop, so who cares 
$C: Its final wish was to piss you off
$C: Be careful ...it might have some dangerous disease
$C: Poor guy, I feel for you. The bird I mean. ;)
$C: "Your day"? How about the bird's day.
$C: ["My parakeet Petey... he's dead. His head fell off!! ...yeah, he was pretty old."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbvSQRHUm6c)
$C: Buy a lottery ticket!!!
$C: 7 years of good luck and a new Disney movie script
$C: That’s how I wanna go
$C: r/wtf
$C: I say "Eye for an Eye", fight fire with fire. Next bird nest you see.... you know what to do! Just not in a public park, cause its awkward to poop in a public park in my experience
$C: Was death really a decision the bird made? Seems like it's day was harder... or way easier depending on your view point
$C: My day? Went to adjust the rear view mirror and this happened. [DAMN IT!](https://i.imgur.com/elcKG3r.jpg) 
$C: Bird saw you’re using a Dell 
$C: My windows are so closed, so I have that going for me which is nice
$C: That’s one heck you of a way to go there birdie!
$C: Hey atleast it didn't shit in between the keys!
$C: Ewww, a Dell!
$C: Did it go through your glass window or Windows on your laptop?
$C: Probably sleeping coz Ur such bad company 
$C: I thought the phrase went. "Eat shit and die!"
$C: r/birdsbeingdicks
$C: Huh, I can relate on the poo front.

I strimmed a bag of dogshit and got splattered with it.

I changed. Went back out. 

And immediately strimmed another pile.
$C: Better than the birds day.
$C: Anyone else wanna know what that is blocked out under OP’s laptop?
$C: Pretty good actually. Thanks for asking! ;)
$C: Better than yours... 
$C: Well, I'm not about to die of fucking Bird Flu, so that's nice I guess.
$C: Holy shit.

Guess it gave you the bird.
$C: Oh...well then.
$C: Dude, you've got a Dell.
$C: /r/WTF 
$C: That bird lived a crazy life, man. 
$C: I guess you really do shit your pants when you die.
$C: What were you doing when all this happened?
$C: He might just be sleeping! I sleep really well after a good poop.
$C: Step one: figure out if you’re in a comedy or a tragedy.
$C: Give it an adrenaline shot. Should do the trick 
$C: Nature has flipped you the bird.
$C: Bird was a Linux guy. 

Shit on a Windows PC, and died in peace. 
$C: I think I saw this in a movie... the seventh sign. I think huge hail rocks will rain down on you next. 
$C: Was there at least a note?
$C: It may not be dead, just in shock (probably wasn't expecting you to be there, since it also shit itself?) 

Maybe leave it by the window for the night to be sure.. 
$C: Nature meets technology, and realises they're the same thing. The reality of it was too much for him to cope with.
$C: He died doing what he loved.
$C: Poor bird
$C: So, a bird flew through your window and into your windows?
$C: Its that a bad omen?!?
$C: Use linux, "cacaw"
$C: Are you Walt from Lost? 
$C: Damn. Normally you gotta pay for a cat to get that kind of fuckery
$C: You didn’t hear? Decapitated. Whole big thing. We had a funeral for a bird.
$C: Stop complaining you just got a free meal 
 🦅🍗🍗
$C: Well, my bank shut off my card by accident and wont open it back up because of "policy."  This happened Saturday...still no new card...fuck me.
$C: How did it died? There should be a good logical reason.
$C: Some birds are complete tits.
$C: Pretty shitty
$C: did u try to give it a CPR?
$C: Did you get that thing I sent you?
$C: you gave him a heart attack. that is why the bird pooped right there and died. feel bad OP
$C: OP is going to end up dead within a week.
$C: Not the power button!
$C: Looks like a Stellar’s Jay maybe. 
$C: Caught my pit bull chewing on a dead rat like a piece of jerky. Having the same day as you it seems. 
$C: My day is fine. Thanks 
$C: Its a sign. Watch out.
$C: That bird needs more fiber son. 
$C: Is this what being left on read looks like?
$C: When God hates you, personally
$C: Bro I think u have the exact computer I have and let me tell u that mine sucks complete ass now.......how is yours doing lol
$C: Your house must stink, OP. 
$C: What a fowl way for your day to go.  
$C: Where are it’s legs?
$C: It seems as if it’s going a little better then yours, but that’s because I stayed home browsing Reddit for 3 hours.
$C: Have you given it all proper burial?
$C: Pic or it didn't..... Oh wait
$C: Old DELL laptop. - Bird poop likely caused a small short for a second and killed the bird.
$C: Flew through your window to shit on your windows.
$C: WITNESS ME!!!
$C: So what does it feel like to be “Patient 0”?
$C: OP looks up: "You've got to be shitting me."
$C: When you’d rather die than deliver one more Trump tweet.
$C: alright
$C: "Decided"
$C: This is a sign of your upcoming death
$C: Serves you right for using a DELL "laptop". Everybody knows that a real laptop has a red dot in center of keyboard.
$C: this post made me follow this subreddit
$C: Big L
$C: Hello patient zero
$C: Downloaded Microsoft bird by accident
$C: The equivalent of flipping your Vette when you’re 90. 
$C: At least the bird shit didn’t get all down in the keys. You have that going for you.
$C: Did you let the cat order food again ?
$C: r/wellthatsucks
$C: We had a funeral for a bird.
$C: The epitome of /r/birdsbeingdicks
$C: You're having a much better day than the bird. 
$C: I’d probably kill myself too, if I accidentally landed on a DELL. 
$C: It might just be drunk. I've seen that behaviour a thousand times.
$C: Omg. This cracked me up. Old folklore says you now have good luck for 5.29 years. 
$C: Time to learn taxidermy 
$C: We have the same work laptop- any chance we’re co workers doing this remote work lifestyle? 
$C: The bird must have been having “shitty” day
$C: I don't think you'd press windows+L to lock it, so either you have an external mouse or you had to use the mouse pad around the bird's head to lock you laptop. 

Pretty cool! 

I mean sick.
$C: r/Wellthatsucks
$C: A lot better than yours, it looks like.
$C: A new wave a Avian protest against the unintended consequences of technology on their communities.   
$C: Did you even consider that it was God flipping you the bird?
$C: You killed that motherfucker for shitting on your laptop didn’t you?
$C: Not as bad as the bird's day. 
$C: When I told you to get Twitter on your computer, this is not what I meant.
$C: Think he flew through the wrong window(s)
$C: You're a wizard, Harry.
$C: My day’s worse. I flew into a window, shit myself in front of this random guy, and then died. 
$C: Something bad is going to happen to the corn harvest. I can feel it. It's time to hold a lottery. That should appease the gods.
$C: About the same as the bird’s
$C: its how i want to go out.
$C: The bird didn't have a good day either. 
$C: Got some tickets in the mail for some tolls I apparently went through while in Virginia. Got these large bills for something I wasn't aware of in the first place. 

I'll take several dying after pooping on my laptop birds over my day. 

😁
$C: r/nevertellmetheodds
$C: Better now!
$C: bad sign op your going to die soon... 
$C: I'm not a professional at deciphering omens but you might want to stay in today.
$C: >a bird flew in my window, shit in my laptop, and then I murdered it

Ftfy
$C: Sounds like a scene out of South Park. 
$C: You work in a federal agency?
$C: Same thing happened to me yesterday 
$C: That's why you always leave a note.
$C: Dude took the no screens rule of this sub way too seriously.
$C: Tiring! I have the exact same laptop though. Do you know where I can get another charger as I've lost mine!
$C: What you have there is a keybird (or a keyboard if you're from liverpool)
$C: Decapitated. Whole big thing. We had a funeral for a bird.
$C: I shit you not, he’s telling the truth
$C: Well i moved the trash can to the curb this morning and there was a half face dead cat under it so that was a start.
$C: “Take’n a half day, boss.”
$C: Revenge for all the times you played angry birds on the toilet
$C: These Twitter notifications are getting out of hand
$C: Just a heads up: that bird will have bird lice, but don't worry -- it does not infest humans.
$C: Enjoy being patient zero in this next end of the world scenario!
$C: WTF were you watching?
$C: Sorry for your loss
$C: So you’re telling me twitter crashed through windows and took a shat on your laptop?
$C: Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral? You never can tell what your day here is gonna turn into.
$C: Better than that bird's day I guess.
$C:  Maybe he found a bad bug on your system. XD
$C: He must have been in some deep "shit" and wanted to warn you about the bird mafia planning to kill you
$C: Got a flat tire, stuck in middle of no where. Just bought the vehicle (used) made sure it had a spare BUT not the equipment to change it so I’m jackless and even the tow truck didn’t have the right equipment....
Now waiting for my husband to come find me and bring a jack and rod thing to HOPE it works...

Feelsbadman 😑
$C: At least you’re having a better day than the bird.

$C: *mercyful fate plays softly in the distance*
$C: Have you considered buying some window screens...
$C: It's a fake bird. You can tell since it's not moving.
$C: At least he didn't shit on your keyboard
$C: The way the OP described it tho brilliant
$C: I feel like that’s a bad omen. You might want to see a priest or shaman depending on what you believe....
$C: [Pretty Bird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UeRHUvY4XY)

$C: That’s piss actually. 
$C: Well, I don't still have Windows 8, so my day is going better no matter what happens to either one of us
$C: My cat tried to eat my phone and then my other cat threw up a hairball in my smoothie.  That's my day in a nutshell.
$C: It's going okay. Thank you. 
$C: This bird is my spirit animal
$C: The actual series finale to The Regular Show
$C: Better than yours apparently
$C: I got exactly the same laptop.

$C: What’s on that paper that you scribbled out?
$C: It crapped out. Literally too.
$C: Dark wings dark words
$C: Look at me *Mr. I have a window*. 
$C: Oh my god 
$C: This is not how you shit post. 
$C: ...A well everybody's heard about the bird! Bird bird bird, the bird is the word!

$C: I had a racing pigeon land in my garden and eat bird seed out of my hand this morning - think I got the better deal
$C: Isn't that some shit
$C: Craptop cowputer.
$C: You are the worst Disney Princess ever.

$C: Looks like a solitaire
$C: Not too great, I've been training birds to fly in through windows and shit on peoples laptops, but one of them didn't come back :(
$C: Pretty good, thanks for asking. 
$C: Looking forward to the new game of zones
$C: How do you clean this?
$C: Pretty sure the days going worse for the bird.
$C: Its so sad, I hope you'll make a funeral for him! 
$C: Looks like it knows what kind of computer you have. 
$C: Not as good as you op. I didn't get a free meal today.
$C: That's flocked up.
$C: How did it get squished like that holy shit 
$C: Lol
$C: So how's bird flu going for ya?
$C: Go home and start over tomorrow that's a bad sign
$C: Is this how the pcmr notifies people that it's time to upgrade? 
$C: Obviously it read whatever horrifying thing you blacklined on that paper there. Entirely your fault.
$C: My boss wanted to me to run an errand 20 minutes before I finish my shift instead of my coworker who ends his shift in 3 more hours ans is the one in charge of those this week. Thanks for asking about my day. At least you got a weird story to tell for those weirds moments at a party
$C: Bruh
$C: Are you someone's shitty boss? You might be in a prorevenge story.
$C: Windows 10 kills birds.
$C: Yea its a dell are you surprised?
$C: One last fuckery before I die
$C: Looks like a patient zero starter pack. 
$C: Been involved in idiotic reddit comment threads.  You are having a better day.
$C: That is some fucking Alfred Hitchcock sheeet.
$C: Man, that’s exactly how I wanna go.  
$C: Bird flu, run!
$C: I predict this will become one of the most upvoted posts of the year. 
$C: Free lunch!
$C: My window is closed...
$C: This should be nsfw

$C: Oh look free lunch. I guess you can save your Tupperware for tomorrow.
$C: That laptop style looks familiar.  Luckily that cable is green.  Carry on.
$C: See what happens when you don't update the twitter app?
$C: Do you know how hard it is to install a keyboard observation app on a bird? Who ever sent him, really wants your password.
$C: WALT!!! WALT!!!! WALT!!!!  
$C: I guess it's kinda better now, knowing what happened to my bird. Closure :/
$C: I always heard windows were the 2nd biggest killer of birds globally. 
$C: Birds often shit when they hit Windows.
$C: "Decapitated. Whole big thing. We had a funeral for a bird."
$C: Bird.exe has encountered an unexpected error and will now shut down.
$C: My day is going pretty well. Just grocery shopping. Thank you very much for asking.
$C: That inconsiderate shithead bird, man. 
$C: It's my birthday. Sounds great. 
$C: You also have contracted H1N1. Enjoy!
$C: You killed the blue bird of happiness!
$C: Well shit the bed. 
$C: Looks more like you squished that bird with your laptop
$C: Judging by the redactions, my money is on it being a professional hit!
$C: That is some deadly shit!!
$C: *Windows
$C: Uuuhhh... i took a shit. It was good because i was slightly constipated. So good i guess.
$C: I’m ready to crank up Ice Cube or other 80’s - 90’s gansta rap and go apeshit on my company printer. But I can’t because it’s a huge printer (used for printing pieces the size of a large banner) so I can’t sneak it outside and I would get fired. I have nothing but Reddit to vent my frustrations. 
$C: First a stolen toilet, now this?  WTF is up with August 14th?
$C: Something something Finnish superstition
$C: funny af xD xD [lmao](https://www.protekperfect.us/services/pc-support/)
$C: That sounds like my daily life. 
$C: Wait... did it crash into something and die, or just fly in, land, shit, and die?
$C: "decided to die" in the perfectly flat pancake form we see it in now.... after shitting on his laptop, my guess is OP pulled the lid down ...hard... either pissed of from being freaked out.
$C: That fucker even went to town on your desk with a black marker. How rude!
$C: Better than the birds
$C: What's that's blue ball in between the G, H and B letters?
$C: Sounds like a bad Dell.
$C: Not much of a cheese shop.

  
Whoops. Wrong skit.  Sorry.
$C: Belongs in r/cursedimages
$C: Looks like a non-breeding male [Indigo Bunting](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Indigo_Bunting/overview). Sucks for him and you; nobody deserves to go out like that.
$C: You didn't hear? Decapitated. Whole big thing. We had a funeral for a bird.
$C: :( :(
$C: Why was I looking at the bird and be like "wow that bird shit a lot, and it looks like a bird too"
Then I noticed the bird poo and read the comment "and died right in front of me". 

Me: "oh that was really the bird, looks so flat" 


$C: Bird Death Shit - who wants dibs on the band name? 
$C: That bird got some instant karma right there
$C: And got taxidermy? 
$C: Holy shit, I literally just found two baby finches outside my workplace, one super dead, one barely alive.  Was able to grab the alive one, put him in a container and rush him to the local vet.  He's being rehabilitated now and should recover.  I'm sorry your day turned out so poorly my dude :(
$C: r/WellThatSucks
$C: At least you're having a better day than the bird.
$C: You're days going better than the birds so far!
$C: This is why you should run Linux instead of Winders. 
$C: WTF!

That's Rudy, my bird carrier
$C: No dead birds fortunately.
$C: I'm fine
$C: Dude you're getting a de........dead bird on your Dell.
$C: Looks like some type of bluebird, either female or immature.
$C: If playing games like Plague Inc taught me anything. It's that you should be in quarantine now and the virus, which was just the Oops combo: 'sneezing and diarrhea'.  Has mutated the total organ failure too. So we're all fucked
$C: I'm laughing at my desk at work. My co-workers think I'm insane.

If this happened to me I'd just give up for the rest of the week. No good can come of this. 
$C: Cartman was right! Also birds shit just before die!!!
$C: Atleast the poop missed the keyboard. 
$C: To be fair, it probably shit because it was dying. 
$C: You shouldn't have told him to take a shit and go.
$C: Part of the new No Bird Dies Alone program
$C: Relateable
$C: I shave today. 
$C: I don't know who's having the worst day on reddit, you or the girl who's ex stole her toilet 
$C: Shitty since I lost the bird I poisoned. 
$C: Missed opportunity to have the twitter page in the background 
$C: This really made my shitty day better.
$C: Anyone know what type of bird that is?
$C: U grandpa did that with me 1 time
$C: Wow bro,  thanks now I feel way more better.
$C: Metal
$C: Dang birds flying into windows. Just one more reason to buy a Mac I guess
$C: They'll let any bird be a messenger pigeon nowadays. 
$C: deadbird5
$C: You can't make this shit up.
$C:  Not being cursed.
$C: Wouldn't have happened if you used Linux.
$C: r/techsupportgore
$C: As bad as your day seems to be going, the bird's day is definitely worse.
$C: Went down in a blaze of glory, that there bird sure did. 
$C: bring it back to life and smack it around. 
$C: That is a hella bad omen. Good luck
$C: GET OUT!!!
$C: It’s going amazing. Now. Thanks!
$C: The bird must have been from Southpark.
$C: Now you got the bird flu 
$C: Yeah that's some freaky shit. 
$C: That’s very weird?
$C: Looks like a juvenile western/California scrub Jay to me
$C: It’s...it’s an omen...
$C: I just rode my bike straight into a spiderweb got three spider bites and at least two spiders on me 
$C: Yiu should post this in r/wellthatsucks 
$C: Bird is the word I guess you’ve heard?
$C: you're the opposite of a Disney princess...
$C: A bird flew through the window to die on a Windows laptop 
$C: Better than this.
$C: Witness me!!
$C: “Don’t let them catch you alive after you completed the objective”
$C: put a dead bird on it
$C: The bluebird of happiness!
$C: Better than that bird’s
$C: Not as shitty as yours, obviously 
$C: I thought that was considered good luck in some cultures
$C: The real Sky King. 
$C: That’s gotta b a bad omen. 
$C: This is peak Reddit.
$C: Michael? 
$C: Toby killed this poor bird :(
$C: Well I went out to the garage this morning to the smell of dead animal. I knew it was coming because we suspected a stray had made its way in because stuff was strewn about. I am now cutting holes in my garage wall trying to follow the smell and the flies so I don’t tear up the whole garage. I still haven’t found it.
$C: It’s an omen, more shit is coming your way...
$C: As far as I know no one has cast a spell over me so I guess my day is better than your.
$C: Im sure this is a lucky sign...somewhere...
$C: Glad you recognize the problem. Windows are the cause of many bird deaths (so say the signs at my local zoo, I was there for my nephews birthday 2 weeks ago). But again glad to see your concerns are only about yourself. And I’m glad you recognize the need to put these stickers on the glass that the zoo did so birds recognize the glass. Hope your day gets better!
$C: Similar thing happened to Conan O’Brien.  Could be a sign 🤔
$C: This is so sad Alexa play despacito 69
$C: Kinda of expected for a dell isn’t it?
$C: Bird.exe has stopped!
$C: Dude you are fucked
$C: Today, buy a lottery ticket
$C: Hate when that happens 
$C: "Wuphf"
$C: Better'n yours
$C: I think you may want to call work and tell them that you have a 'technical issue' 
$C: California Scrub Jay?
$C: Must be a real diehard Apple fanboy
$C: It saw OP using a Dell and wanted out.
$C: Shit happens then you die is probably the morale of that event...
$C: At least its a Dell
$C: You spilled ink on your paper too. Bummer!
$C: If this happened during the bird flu scare...
$C: I thought I was in /r/budgies for a minute and was very shocked and sad.
$C: Dude you’re getting a Dell 
$C: In my country that is good luck!
$C: Cool, you got a spontaneous free meal.  Poultry doesn't get more fresh than that.
$C: How do you like that Dell?
$C: I mean, hey... Free bird, right? 
$C: I hear in some cultures that is considered good luck. 
$C: Well I guess not only my life is shitty. At least this bird got ballz to say I don't give a shit about this life 
$C: From bird's perspective:
Sky is the limit.
$C: At least you made front page, I mean damn! This was the FIRST post I saw lmfao.... gross tho 
$C: Windows 10 is enough to kill anyone.
$C: Dell - not even once.
$C: Could be worse... Someone could have stolen your toilet.
$C: The store I work at got robbed today by three people with knives, they stole 13 Samsung and Apple phones off the display 
$C: That was supposed to be chicken. Amazon’s new lunch delivery service still needs some tweaking. 
$C: Slam it shut and go get drunk 
$C: not to great. my bird died
$C: Same laptop 
$C: what is the opposite of a Disney princess
$C: Nuked a hadoop cluster, caused my coworker to lose last month's worth of work
$C: yeah but wee birdie chose to spend it's last moments with you. 
$C: Am I blind or does this bird have no feet 
$C: Poor fella
$C: Laptop so old, even the twitter's communication service has to change
$C: ive been watching a lot of crazy korean movies the last couple days and if ive learned anything its that you’ve been targeted and will die soon. 
$C: At least it didn't die alone. Give the little guy a proper cremation. 
$C: Better than that birds
$C: Some bird did that on mine too. Even worse, her name was Tracy, she was from Stoke and her fat arse completely crushed my keyboard!
$C: I was on a conference call today and saw a quick shadow of bird wings on window, with a thud, i looked outside and it was a ROADRUNNER!

edit: BEEP BEEP
$C: I drove three hours in a rental car to go sightseeing only to get a flat tire. Took me an hour to fix and i had to turn around without seeing anything. Drove an hour to a mechanic but they were closed. 

Oh yeah, I'm in Iceland. No AAA, no 24 hour road service
$C: Hahaha you owe me five bucks Kyle!
$C: Hats superstitiously bad luck in Asian ways - 
$C: That’s the way I want to go
$C: Hey! I have that laptop minus the extra bits 
$C: That was rude
$C: Maybe the bird was making a statement about Dell.
$C: Looks like he wanted to go out in a blaze of glory. Unfortunately for you he decided your window was the right one. 
$C: He wanted to die by the ocean
$C: >How's your day going?

Better than that bird's, so I've got that going for me, which is nice.
$C: RIP 
$C: South park was right when you die you shit your pants
$C: Great thanks. My sons first day of school. I cried like a baby. 
$C: Sounds like somebody’s got a case of the Tuesdays.
$C: Pool little fella.
$C: Do you not have screens on your windows?
$C: Sell it to a blind kid along with some baseball cards and marbles.
$C: From outside to inside?
$C: That bird just didn't give a shit. 

Oh, I guess it did. 
$C: Something is coming, and it sure as fuck ain't Winter.
$C: went to mail documents for my state license and the clutch plates on my motorcycle were frozen (its a open clutch and rain hates it). got the documents mailed out but my clutch was slipping so bad I had to turn around and grab my car to make an appointment. got there 5 min early to find out the appointment happened a hour and half earlier. now im sitting at home drinking a very stiff margarita mid day and all is well. 
$C: Dude what happened to that bird... Where did it all go wrong little bro?
$C: Could of been worse
$C: Good
$C: Toma ya
$C: Imagine if he had the hp omen laptop lol. 
$C: Bout the same 
$C: bird was like 'f*ck yo laptop n*gga' 
$C: Ew gross you have the nub mouse
$C: It's ok little tired little hungry... you gonna eat that?
$C: Some days you're the bird and some days you're the laptop.
$C: r/wellthatsucks
$C: Tweety bird is going to hunt your ass down. 
$C: You must of made the bird mad if it’s last dying wish was to crap on your pc and die in front of you
$C: This is so sad Alexa play Despacito 
$C: Way better than that, Damien. 
$C: Little guy used his ultimate move
$C: Cursed jpg
$C: At least it's not a Windows update. 
$C: Can't complain
$C: Ahh, he’s only mostly dead. 
$C: I'm laid up with a broken ankle. I can only eat what my kids (10 and 14) can prepare for me. Thankfully they are good cooks. 
$C: TDIL: The white part is piss and the dark part is shit. So technically your laptop got pissed and shit on. 
$C: Considering how quickly that bird died after coming into contact with your Dell device, I'd really question what materials that thing is made of, even heavy metals or uranium don't kill THAT fast. x
$C: /r/awww
$C: That's unusual. Pooping usually happens after dying.
$C: Looks like he squirted pretty far? Did he literally shit himself to death??
$C: Better, I suppose.
$C: It was a chirp for help
$C: The important thing is, he had someone dear to his heart nearby at the time of his death.
$C: In bird culture, that is considered a dick move.
$C: I guess WiFi is dangerous.
$C: I bet your day is going better than the bird
$C: ...*How*?...
$C: I flew into some guy's window, shit on his laptop, and then proceeded to die in front of him. How's your day going?
$C: The anti Disney princess. 
$C: Qwerty the birdie!! 
$C: Looks like the bird, gave a shit after all. (cue shades)
YYYEEEEEAAAAAAHHHH!!!!
$C: That bird had evidence agains Hillary. Find the hidden note!
$C: Good luck...?
$C: The bluebird of happiness!
$C: Fucking jolly now that I have a benchmark 
$C: Someone gave you the bird
$C: I would be VERY careful about touching that bird, and maybe even call animal control so they can do tests on it. Sounds like very unusual behavior, and it may have some form of disease.
$C: South park was right you do shit yourself when you die
$C: You MIGHT want to see a doctor.... get gloves... take the bird with you in a ziploc.  You don't know what that disease is....
$C: You really do shit before you die...
$C: Must be a Tuesday
$C: Most days I want to sh*t on Windows 10, too.
$C: Better then the birds.

$C: Probably because you have a Dell. 

:(
$C: I've been shit on all my life.
$C: Pretty good thanks
$C: That new Windows update got too real.
$C: You Army I see that green NIPR cable son
$C: Is it OK if I die here? No? OK, well, oh, fuck I'm dead *poop*. 
$C: Better than yours apparently.
$C: bruh just reading the title made me crack up
$C: Congrats on your new bird flu OP.
$C: On the plus side, now you have lunch!
$C: One time I was at a bar sitting on the patio, enjoying a few beers with some friends. All of a sudden I notice this bird fly into the patio area and then b-line towards the fan. It hit the fan, slammed onto our table, and proceed to twitch and slowly die from a broken neck right in front of us. 

Me and my roommate didn’t know what to do so we buried it under the nearby tree. A few hours later one of our friends drunkenly stumbled over and (unknowingly) puked right on the lil birdies grave :(
$C: paging r/BirdsBeingDicks
$C: Twitter in response: it’s not a bug it’s a feature.
$C: Chirp! 
(translation: “From Hell's heart, I stab at thee!”)
$C: Maybe it’s good luck???
$C: Same thing happened to me today but I was the one that took the shit on my laptop... Hope I don't die
$C: I got laid off today from my job of 2.5 years with no money and no savings. and a me and my wife to support. So yea... I'd rather have a bird shit on my laptop.
$C: Pretty bad but not that bad. Although whatever is found out about my car today may make it that bad financially. I just want today to be over with. 😞
$C: I dont even know if I'd be mad. I think I'd be more incredoulous than anything
$C: r/MurderedByKeywords
$C: Where are the birds legs!?
$C: That's actually a sign in many ancient tribes that if a bird lands in your personal space, shits and dies, you're doing something you're not supposed to be doing basically.

Good luck :D
$C: Not as good as your day
$C: It saw you using Windows 10. 
$C: WUPHF
$C: Free pocket pussy 
$C: I just found out I’m a synesthete 
$C: I was playing a game with a friend when all of a sudden I hear "there a bird in my house". After much more chaos he found out his cat brought a live bird into his basement. 
$C: Did it fly into your Windows? 
$C: Oh no u_u so sorry about your day. And poor bird
$C: Post on reddit,IG 😂
Asking people how’s your day going?
$C: Famous on Reddit after death, one can only dream
$C: Better than I thought I guess.
$C: I'd be curious about the emissions from my laptop and how they might have contributed to said birds sudden-onset death!!!   
$C: It's likely the bird flew in and hit the laptop (like they do with mirrors and windows) and shit on impact (like people in car accidents). 😜
$C: Wouldn't have happened with Linux.
$C: Dude.  You're shitting a Dell.
$C: I’d call dell and ask if the  warrantee will cover the situation
$C: End of the world.
$C: Deadbirb5
$C: Looks like a juvenile Eastern Bluebird. Where are you located? Perhaps a recent fledgling and a clumsy flier. 
$C: On the plus side, free toy. 
$C: Damn bro bad omen
$C: After his concussion he probably thought “Oh shit I’m gonna die here”
$C: Avian flu?
$C: Hey, it's a Dell. That bird died trying to tell you how shit tier that company is.
Seriously, fuck Dell.
$C: Well uhm, better than the bird's
$C: Its a Sicillian message.  Luca Brasi sleeps with the birdies.
$C: This would be a good start to a movie about an outbreak of a highly infectious and incurable disease affecting all complex organisms. 
$C: I think you need to be tested for mutant abilities. 
$C: Who did you piss off lol
$C: Seven daaaaays
$C: OP, how are you feeling right now at this very moment?
$C: Literal craptop
$C: Looks to be a well-placed shit, avoiding difficult to clean spaces. A very honorable birth in death. 
$C: Better than yours apparently...
$C: You are now the Disney princess of death?
$C: IT IS AN OMEN FROM THE GODS
$C: wow, its an omen
$C: The bird isn't the Microsoft Word.
$C: It was a Raven. From Dell. The message should be clear. 
$C: Kinda saddens me that everybody has the computer wallpaper.
$C: Look at this dude. Has money for a laptop. Has window. Lives in place where birds can survive. Gets free fertilizer. So, to answer your question, not too well.
$C: How’s my day going? I work for Allstate and I sell insurance.  Today I sold to a man and after I set everything up and made the payment he called back and said he didn’t want to go through with it. I was embarrassed because everyone heard that conversation. Huge confidence killer because I’m still in training and I was so happy when I mad the sale.
$C: Probably hates Dell 
$C: Sinister
$C: Better
$C: Just found out my dad is in the hospital in bad condition after a stroke while on vacation. I'm not doing very well at all.
$C: It's not dead it's asleep.
$C: Bro, that looks do fake😂
$C: Better than the birds
$C: this just nullified that cat chasing the dog's tail through the window
$C: I was in a hurry, walked on traintracks, wasent let on my train and now im stuck in kalmar and i live in sthlm
$C: OP killed a bird and put a dab of white paint on his laptop, all for those sweet sweet internet points.
$C: My dog is getting stitches on his throat because of my other dog. So pretty shitty here too. Cheers
$C: So, what did it ask you to say to it's family?
$C: Poor bird.
$C: What is OP killed his pet bird for shitting in his laptop and then posts on Reddit for Karma? I smell a conspiracy.
$C: Time for a new laptop.
$C: I think this is the universes way of telling you to get a Thinkpad instead. 
$C: It looks like a “Twitter” bird so perhaps someone send you a tweet
$C: Forevermore
$C: When you haven't aired out your bedroom in years
$C: Has anyone else noticed that animals that drink a/c runoff? Then die?
$C: I saw 2 dead doves in the street as well. Wow what a deadly day. 
$C: My past Friday, the old man above me flooded apartment at 4 AM and then later that day he died leaving the coroner to close off his apartment leaving it damp. My walls are seeping water. :(
$C: SSSSSCCRRAAAAAAAAAAAAW!

OUR BRAVE ELDERLY CITIZENS SPEND THEIR FINAL MOMENTS IN DEFIANCE OF THE MUDMEN!

SCCCCRRRRRRRAW!
$C: Cartmans still right 
$C: Damn poor bird *that was funny tho
$C: “Decided to die”
$C: Lucky
$C: Poopy.
$C: If you think your day is rough think about the bird's day.
$C: Rate my setup.
$C: Clearly, we need bird resistant laptops, Dell. 
$C: Were you searching up pictures of pigs?
$C: why do you think you have to censor the word shit
$C: Banana cream!
$C: Harry Potter here. I sent a f'ing owl and you f'ing ignored it. Now that I have your f'ing attention I am going to send another f'ing owl and see if you take the f'ing letter. I have lots of f'ing birds I can do this all f'Ing day you know.
$C: She flew through your window right into your Windows. 
$C: "Avenge me" -bird probably 
$C: Rest in peace
$C: What is in your air that killed it?
$C: Not as good as yours, OP.
$C: r/shittydisneyprincess
$C: What a shitty day dude.
$C: GES?
$C: Is this a sign of good luck or bad luck?
$C: At least he died doing what he loved.
$C: Hats superstitiously bad luck in Asian ways - 
$C: Before I die, I just needed to spend my last breath making sure you knew you're a fucking hack.  Don't bury me, you'll just fuck it up.
$C: I would be very careful today.  You keep hearing about the Elephant in the room. 
$C: You a govie?
$C: I wonder if he had a little bird heart attack :(
$C: O pobresito
$C: He flew too close to the sun. On a lighter note, I have that same shitty work laptop.
$C: Decode the shit, the fate of all life depends on it.
$C: felt the hoarse head in bed was a cliche went with something more subtle 
$C: I am selling a 100% Birdshit/ Dead bird Free Dell over in /r/hardwareswap if you are worried about Avian Flu or Sparrow Ghosts haunting you for the rest of your days.

$C: TIFU by leaving my window open...
$C: A bird shit on me today for the second time this week!
$C: Dude, you are getting a DELL!
$C: Better
$C: Ah the classic shit then die trick.
$C: Is there a video? 
$C: My day is going better than the birds day, that's for sure.  RIP little guy.  
$C: Oh, I see you got the new "Developers Preview" from Microsoft!
$C: Bird flu
$C: Go ask the doctor about H5N1..
$C: Well obviously, if a birds gets that close to space it dies. This could have been prevented.
$C: That's good luck
$C: It thought the latest patch fixed Windows... 
$C: Buy a lottery ticket and every scratch ticket you can afford. That has to be good luck. 
$C: I'm programming an industrial automation workcell with four robots. For some reason the combination of software options we've loaded onto the robots makes them freeze up every time I try to back it up. So I called tech support. They asked for a backup so they could try to recreate the issue in their lab. Do you see the problem? Because I'm amazed at how long it took them to understand.
$C: Better than yours , at least.
$C: dude clean your keyboard... 
$C: uh...better?
$C: I mean, I'm at work on the first full day of a cool new WoW expansion... I'd rather be at home with Dead Bird and playing.
$C: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers

Your going to want to send a request for a retransmission 
$C: That bird really doesn't like Dell.
$C: Dat metaphor though. 
$C: The bird had a much worse day than you buddy! 
$C: This is how apocalypse starts
$C: Maybe you aren't using Windows properly.
$C: You're about to shit blood. This is the beginning of a House M.D. episode.
$C: Nobody remembered my birthday :/
$C: WHY WOULD YOU PUT THAT THERE? IT'S SO TANTALIZING 
$C: Hopefully it isn't an omen pigeon
$C: If only there was some way of knowing the rough, time and date of the event!
$C: The windows vs apple wars have gone too far
$C: Your bad day has made my bad day better
$C: I always expected that the Dell Laptop “bird chirping” sound was a fatal error.
$C: Can't tell if this is ridiculous enough for r/thathappened or just the right amount of ridiculousness to have actually happened 
$C: Birds have a tendency to die when they fly into Windows.
$C: I thought the dead body was the shit.
$C: Probably saw the price of the ~~laptop~~ craptop.
$C: That’s full of multiple signs! Take the day off!
$C: Came in to shit on your dell, decided to off itself when it saw you using windows explorer 
$C: Prettyy bird...pretty bird...
$C: Honestly, I'm sitting here crying.  This gave me a little chuckle. Thanks OP! And at least it didnt shit on the keyboard.
$C: Was it laden or unladen?
$C: Parakeet, parashit, paradie.
$C: Cardinal crashed into my window 
$C: That's the least of your problems considering you're using a Dell (dude).
$C: You wash your Windows with Windex don't you?
$C: FAKE NEWS....its all fake. Biggest giveaway is WIN10 cannot run on that POS laptop
$C: Its not dead, thats a Norwegian blue. Its resting  
$C: Maybe West Nile? Florida has had a few cases in Sarasota County recently.
$C: whoa, dells have trackpoints?
$C: You should be glad it didn't shit on your keyboard.
$C: Old head probably had a stroke.
$C: It’s The Birds all over again 
$C: I dunno who you pissed off, but I would suggest burning some Sage and maybe posting a public apology on FB or something.  That's some bad juju. 
$C: ...Travis?
$C: Dayum! That stinks.
$C: Op killed a bird, put it on his laptop and smeared mayonnaise everywhere
$C: When two guys come to your house and identify themselves as Agents Hetfield and Hammett, pay attention.
$C: I just got back from a hike where I crossed paths with a pack of coyotes. They didn't shit on my stuff and die in front of me though, so I'd have to say my day is probably going better than yours.
$C: Well, you made it all about you but the only real tragedy here is the poor bird.  
$C: Tuesday, August 14, 2007
$C: If this thread isn't full of The Office references, I don't want to live any longer.
$C: 😢
$C: Have you turned it off and back on?
$C: Somewhere God is like, "pfft...she knows what she did..." 
$C: You think your day is going bad.  How about the bird?  It had the worst day possible.
$C: That's how I want to go
$C: Bird up
$C: Not to complain but my $1000 clutch replacement won’t get me all this mad karma, your day is the tips man!
$C: At least it didn't shit on the keyboard! 
$C: If it's any restitution to you, the shitting was probably a result of the dying and not a deliberate act...Unless it was the other way around, in which case, that is fantastic.
$C: Well, I've started a new job where I don't get paid to sit in a restaurant all day, so mine's not going too much better.
$C: In bird culture this is considered a dick move.
$C: Welcome to the world of bird flu, sorry you die next. 
$C: Up vote for having the same laptop that I have.
$C: Ha ha!! Give it mouth to mouth
$C: My boss just told me he's letting me go after 6 years. Glad to know I'm not having *that* shitty of a day. 
$C: Good thing you blacked out that wifi password;[ I was totally gonna steal your internet dude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teKlTKcDIOA) ;)
$C: fire up the grill
$C: Now that's what I call a greeting
$C: Holy shit
$C: I had my first colonoscopy today. I needed the nap.
$C: Better than the birds', that's for sure.
$C: It died of embarrassment
$C: [r/Wellthatsucks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/?st=JKU58FC0&sh=130d4a71) 
$C: That's insane hehehe
$C: This perfectly sums up how my Blue Jays' baseball season has went
$C: It looks like you closed the laptop on the bird 
$C: What the actual fuck LOL 
$C: Alot better than yours 🤣
$C: Amazon prime delivers
XOXO
$C: Rip little birdy. 
$C: Spending the day at my in-laws, soooo.... Tradies?
$C: Yep, you're cursed.
$C: Surprising not *that* shitty 

also, if I knew I was gonna die, I would shit on some specific people that I know also
$C: Little do we know OP is now patient zero in the pandemic that wipes out the human species.
$C: oh
$C: mmm... looks like you are the new villain from the next disney movie
$C: A LAPTOP flew in my bird, shit on my day and my window died right behind me.

It could always be worse OP!
$C: A girl in r/WTF  had her toilet stolen by her ex boyfriend, thats pretty shitty(pun always intended).
$C: When you don't agree to the new privacy policy......
$C: Did you try turning it on and off again? My mouse ocassionly freezes up, this usually does the trick.
$C: I mean...I’d say you’re having a better day than the bird, at least.
$C: Hey i have that laptop too
$C: Targeted Avian Ebola Delivery System.  You must have pissed off the wrong Yemenis.
$C: I mean, at least your boyfriend didn’t steal your toilet.
$C: Well at least you got some feedback on your screenplay.
$C: OP took a dead bird, squeezed the shit out of it and dropped it's corpse on his laptop so he coukd take a picture of it. 

At least, that's where my mind went instantly. Is it more fucked up that was my first impulse, or that its not unlikely? 

(No offence OP, I hope your day goes bettter lol)
$C: Isn't it lucky for a bird to shit on you
$C: WITNESS ME!!!
$C: poor lil birb :( 
$C: Ayy I got the same laptop 
$C: Did it fly out of Window 10?
$C: What's an omen?
$C: Oh no. What has my life come to? Becky! Becky lemme smash.
$C: *decided. More like you got mad at it for shitting on your laptop and you hit ‘delete’ on its ass. 
$C: Your office isn't by any chance located in a mineshaft, right?  If so, I've got some bad news...
$C: Shit happens...
$C: Someone does **not** like you.
$C: It was destiny.
$C: I guess Cartman was right this whole time
$C: Flew into a windows I see. 
$C: Remarkable bird, the Norwegian Blue. Beautiful plumage.
$C: Quickly, upgrade to Windows 10.1
$C: Nice! Free lunch! Delivery included!
$C: 😢
$C: Sell it to the blind neighbor kid. 
$C: Hey bro I heard that's good luck. 
$C: Also, maybe repent or ask forgiveness for whatever shit you did in the last 48hrs. Just a thought.
$C: Was it carrying a coconut...?
$C: Well I have been dying of the same god damn fever for the past 5 days and the same headache for 7. I was spinal tapped but nothing came up from it (yay) but fuck your day really sucks. 
$C: It might be playing dead, did the eyes turn white?
$C: Well I don't have bird flu.
$C: Resuscitate it so you can kill it again for shitting on your laptop. 
$C: Do you work at Boeing? Bc I have that same laptop with the same background.
$C: Wifi cooked his brains. This is why we need to shift to hardline fiberoptics. Its killing life.
$C: Like the bird's.
$C: Electrical interference 
$C: Bitch ass bird
$C: When you die, you shit
$C: OMG I think we have the same computer!!! Heyyyy
$C: Wow mercury retrograde is brutal.
$C: Better now...yikes. 
$C: Well dying and shitting kinda go hand in hand
$C: Is that a blue jay?
$C: I have the same laptop but without the birdshit 
$C: That must have been an interesting ticket to IT.

"Hi guys, a bird flew into the office; defecated on my laptop and promptly died. Can I get a new laptop?"

In my place we have an archive going back 15ish years of the "best" (see: completely stupid and/or brilliant) internal company tickets; one like this would really be up there.
$C: Saving this post just for the absolute absurdity that is this entire event. I'm still fucking laughing about it
$C: oh look you got that thing i sent you...finally 
$C: Better than yours!
$C: Better than the birds but sort of like yours
$C: Is that the Dell 7577? If so, it’s a great laptop. Just put a 500gb SSD in mine in addition to the 256gb m.2 ssd.
$C: And this is how the zombie apocalypse begins.
$C: What do you expect it's a Dell.
$C: something similar happened to me, so i was using my laptop then my pet parakeet shit on the computer and somehow impaled it's self with one of my kitchen knives.
$C: pretty good thanks for asking! ✌️👌😁
$C: Well, my boyfriend stole my toilet 
$C: I see you have a Dell. I think that bird did you a favor
$C: One of the t funniest things I ever saw happened to this girl I knew in elementary. She was a pure asshole. No one liked her but she was a very pretty little girl so people put up with her. She was yelling at us about some shit outside in the parking lot...when a bird pooped on her arm and she looked up shocked...and it pooped right in her mouth. She threw up and we laughed. We never let her forget that shit. Best karma I've ever seen. 
$C: This bird just doesn't give a crap anymore.
$C: What was on the paper? What are you hiding?
$C: Ewww but also lmao
$C: I think that bird had a way tougher day 
$C: Flew in through window. Died on the Windows. 
$C: Buster, I KNOW it's a bird, I'm ON the PHONE!
$C: What Wonder Years song is this?
$C: I'd be careful handling the remains of this bird OP, it could very well be carrying all kinds of nasty pathogens.
$C: I have that same laptop.
$C: Job stopped paying for a month, got laid off next month, got knocked down by an infection for 3 weeks, all my savings are gone, only have food for a week and still can't find work. But I'm healthy now, thanks for asking.
$C: Died of embarrassment.
$C: poor lil boy 
$C: What. The. Fuck.
$C: One time a bird hit a window and died at my cabin and we didn't know what to do with it so we had the most disrespectful thing possible by shooting it point blank with a bb gun and that fucker exploded everywhere
$C: Maybe the bird sensed its impending doom and was well aware humans are more intelligent and was asking for help? At least that’s what’s going through my mind when I shit in people’s laptops. 🤷‍♂️ 
$C: True story: in 8th grade, I was sitting next to the fire escape, getting ready to turn in my homework for the day, and a bird flew in the fire escape door and shat all over my work. Teacher didn't believe me until I plopped down the shat-covered paper on her desk--at which point she made me go to the principal's office. Fortunately, he thought it was hilarious that I'd dropped my shat-covered paper on Ms. Battin's desk.
$C: What’s the deal with birds and windows?
$C: Cats are really upping their game
$C: You'll become patient zero. 
$C: Sounds like you're having a shitty day
$C: On the plus side, he didn't get shit on or in the keyboard.
$C: On top of that, it probably had some sort of disease that just contaminated your laptop with. 
$C: HUGE mood
$C: Driving in Ireland - wrong side you know - in cork.
Big fucking roundabout with 5 lanes?! While inside, looking to my googleMaps, ringring got phoned - waaah! Nearly crashed and got the wrong way.. 
but that’s nothing to you 😂
$C: The post under this for me right now is: 
[I split up with my boyfriend yesterday. I fell asleep while he was packing and he stole my toilet.](https://imgur.com/12aVJtu)

So Reddit has one-upped you yet again.
$C: Is that a parakeet??? Aren't they usually pets with clipped wings? My grandma had one just like that. It would "drive" a rc jeep. 
$C: I suspect fowl play
$C: It's a bad omen. shits gonna happen..omg
$C: You are using windows, that's worse!
$C: The bird is alive and just sitting there?? 
$C: I bet your excitement level soared.
$C: >	Repent, for the end is near.
$C: You've got mail. 
$C: Idk what you’re using but I prefer to use Twitter 
$C: Better than his I suppose. Like if comically terrible. 
$C: Really nice bro, I hope my day is as good as yours.
$C: Better than your day. Better than that bird’s day too!
$C: Is it multi-level shit?
$C: This is how those who follow the POTUS on Twitter must feel like every day.
$C: Hey - if something horrible happens to you or a loved one in the coming weeks, can you keep us updated? 
$C: Damn son you singlehandedly killed twitter
$C: Twitter trying to kill a Reddit user
$C: Well, atleast it seems to have missed the keyboard...
$C: I guess, a bird had a heart attack when it saw Bitcoin price dropping so heavily. Had loans from bank and didnt know what else to do to sh\*t everyhting out and put the blames on u
$C: you had a pretty fowl day
$C: They say that is good luck, little sparrow!
$C: So pretty!
$C: I have the exact same laptop at work. 
$C: At least you didn't have to kill it in revenge.
$C: You are the opposite of a Disney princess...
$C: I think he’s just stunned...
$C: That’s so sad. Do you know what kind of bird!
$C: At least your ex didn’t take your toilet. 
$C: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
$C: He flew in your windows to shit on your windows to die because he's Linux Master Race
$C: "Sorry sir, I'm just gonna die here if that's ok."
$C: And people say mercury retrograde isnt real!!! Weird shit happens... it's definitely a sign!!! 
$C: It made the right decision 
$C: Worst part is that you are using Dell 
$C: I walked into my office toilets today and stepped in human shit. So there's that.
$C: That's the same model we give our employees and I work in the I.T. department. Please I hope you're not in my company lol.
$C: Today's my birthday, so pretty good.
$C: You didnt hear? Decapitated, a whole big thing. We had a funeral for a bird.
$C: In my last fortune cookie it said “the blue bird of happiness will shit on your next birthday cake.” Apparently he went to the wrong house. 
$C: It didn't want to die alone... 
$C: Were you using windows? I’ve had that happen at my house. 
$C: Well, that is one way to start your day
$C: Probably exactly what I would do if I ever ran into a Windows laptop...
😁
$C: Shit happened. 
$C: Better buy a lottery ticket. That’s good luck. 
$C: This should be the intro to skyfall song
$C: Sell it to the blind kid in Providence, RI. Might go to hell, but $20 though.
$C: Currently side-glancing that same screen saver while I peruse here, so, pretty unproductive. 
$C: "He got that thing I sent him!"
-Potamus
$C: r/wellthatsucks
$C: But why did you leave your window open without a screen?
$C: Thats how I wanna go out. 
$C: Shit is spelled with an "i", not an asterisk.
$C: Did OP die?

$C: Better than that bird's...
$C: I got laid and didn't see anything die so I'm good.
$C: *shit
$C: [removed]
$C: Maybe you gave it a heart attack...what were you doing on your laptop OP?
$C: It's a sign.
$C: I just bought a slurpee, a corndog, and a joint. Im chillin
$C: This is a mood.
$C: That’s good luck! Go buy a lottery ticket now! 
$C: Remindme! 28 DAYS LATER
$C: Windows didnt crash after the bird hit your laptop?
$C: Shitty Deal,
Bird flew...get your vaccine today!
$C: I can picture it, "awe honey a bird just flew through the wind....oh.
$C: Man I stood up from my laptop, went to take a dump and saw this. You scaring me man...
$C: [removed]
$C: It’s the Crappening
$C: A Dumb and Dummer scene comes to mind...
$C: You must have been watching some horrendous stuff mate 
$C: Shitty, I ran out of pot.
$C: For sale: dead bird, not going cheep
$C: So dramatic 
$C: I think that is still covered by Geek Squad. 
$C: Someone tried to kill me today. So yeah.
$C: It's good luck! 
$C: Better than that birds day
$C: That says something about either Dell or Windows 10
$C: Cabbages, kickers. It hasn't got... A beak!
$C: This person fixed their laptop full of viruses with bird shit! Laptop makers hate him! Find out why!!!
$C: This must be some kind of ominous warning from the future. OP, have you been time traveling and altering the past again? 
$C: Say what you want, but do not shit on the bird.
$C: Twitter is getting out of hand. 
$C: I'd rather the bird than the dell.
$C: r/nevertellmetheodds
$C: Anybody here worried he/she killed it?
$C: People are responding to the thread offering useful advice as if OP is the person that this happened to. When will people learn that 9 times out of 10 that isn’t the case?
$C: Fake News. 
$C: It's just sleeping. Your laptop is warm.
$C: It’s a Dell. Probably improved it. 
$C: Dell finally delivering that BIOS update?
$C: reddit.com/r/natureismetal
$C: yikes lmao 
$C: Do you have blind kid for a neighbor?
$C: And the award to the biggest troll goes to....
$C: In human-culture this is considered a dick move.
$C: this should be how seagull sends all his hatemail.
$C: Well now? Worse.
$C: I once took a summer job at a newspaper where my mom worked. One day on my commute (we drove separate due to work hours) I hit a cardinal. Right on the windshield. Looked in the reargue and saw it fall 3 seconds later.

When I got to work, I told her about it. She had also hit a cardinal on that same road that morning. An hour before me.
$C: r/nevertellmetheodds
$C: Pretty good hbu? 
$C: Uhh. Is that a Bluebird?
$C: This pic remembers to myself that life is a precious treasure! :)
$C: Nice dell latitude! What model is it?
$C: Thats a great advertisement for Dell.
$C: Its an old wives tale that when a bird flies into a closed window that someone you know has died. I can't even imagine what this means. Condolences.
$C: Evidently, a little better than the bird’s
$C: AND YOU ARE USING DELL LAPTOP OMG ITS THE WORST DAY EVER.
$C: That is a mountain bluebird. It was probably in the middle of its migration south :(
$C: The new way of giving someone the bird.
$C: Got passed over for another promotion, another friend told me he’s engaged now too, found out I’ve been paying my sisters insurance for two years although that was last week and I’ve got like an ingrown hair or pimple that gives me a nice reminder it’s their every time I sit. So yea I feel ya 
$C: Hello, I wish to register a complaint...
$C: You think your day is bad? At least you didn’t run into a laptop, crap yourself, and die!
$C: Shitty day lol
$C: Just like my computer. Just took a shit ‘n’ died.
$C: Better than the poor bird.  
$C: That's wack
$C: Was it's last act to redact a document?
$C: I mean look on the positive side, he could have shat all over they keys instead of on that back panel.  
$C: Welcome to Twitter
$C: Better then that poor bird.
$C: Copycat (self) Killer.. A little birdy told em bout that poor, troubled dude in Seattle that stole the plane to fly to his death... Wonder where the shit comes into play though..
$C: He died trying to type out that he was a human living in a bird's body and didnt have long to live.
$C: I'm no doctor, but you should probably visite one.
$C: Copycat (self) Killer.. A little birdy told em bout that poor, troubled dude in Seattle that stole the plane to fly to his death... Wonder where the shit comes into play though..
$C: My day is going better than yours.
$C: "you goin' eat that?"
$C: "YOU CANT CATCH DISEASES FROM A BIRD!"

$C: The laptop though is very familiar..poor little bird
$C: What a shitty day.
$C: At least it died doing what it loved
$C: That’s what you get for leaving Windows open.
$C: Made my day man, thank you :D
$C: Dells are sh*t so I guess symbolism. 
$C: Lmao
$C: My day has been great! I just got my braces out! Thank you for asking!
$C: Looks like someones pet bird. Crows probably messed that poor thing up. =(
$C: I’m just curious to why it died 
$C: Now eat it.
$C: Poor dude didn't want to die alone.
$C: So basic compared to yours
$C: My day is better than the bird.
$C: F
$C: My day? Pretty bad. Not avian death diarrhea bad. But not great.
$C: Well at least bird do is supposed to be good luck
$C: So this is the opposite of a Disney princess, right?
$C: Wtactualf
$C: It's a sign. Twitter is about to shit the bed and go tits up. Dump the stocks now.
$C: Bird be like "I'm gonna die anyway, let's ruin his day"…
$C: This is so sad Alexa play Despacito 2
$C: Well after seeing this...pretty good actually ☺
$C: Free meal
$C: The bird is moving on to it's next life. Why did the bird want you to know it was moving on? 
Who was it before?
$C: Wow
$C: My day is going great when compared to the bird's day!
$C: When the death of another reliving being is an inconvenience
$C: Where’s the shit?
$C: I had a a pigeon fly into my open driver's window and die crashing into the closed rear passenger window. That was wack.
$C: Looks like you got the bluebird of death
$C: Shouldn't have had Windows open. Time to get a Mac.
$C: Natural selection...
$C: Probably better than the bird's
$C: I think she died of fear
$C: So Angry Birds has a sequel. Suicide Birds. *Exclusive to Windows
$C: He thought the windows logo was a way out.
$C: Lol
$C: Me too 
$C: All this guys posts get hella upvotes 
$C: Thats a fuckin curse right there....😐
$C: He unzipped his files 
$C: That's exactly how I want to go out
$C: Idk man but that's seriously some bad juju
$C: I've been reduced to anxiety tears by two people under 5. My oldest burst into the bathroom because something, saw me changing my tampon and all the blood in my panties and started freaking out. The smaller one (20 mos) came in and grabbed them smearing everything with his bloody hands... And is generally just climbing and jumping off all the things. Doors have been locked, cars flushed, and candy stolen from the store.

Needless to say, today has pushed me to the point of calling the doctor and making me deal with my anxiety before I start becoming an alcoholic and day drinking.
$C: That's the way I want to go out.
$C: I think your title says a lot about you as a person, OP. Not only that you use asterisks to censor curses on reddit, but a living breathing soul left this world today and all you can think about is how it inconvenienced you for 45 seconds, and then how you could get karma for it.
$C: Better than the bird's.
$C: Lol you stole this from FB. 

KARMA WHORE!
$C: I don't know its science or just weird. But Birds often Poop one instance before dying.
$C: Oh dear God! You killed the bluebird of happiness! 
$C: Oooh nooooo. So sorry. What did you do with the bird? 
$C: Ummm I'd avoid anything final destination related. Just stay home
$C: Nice. 
$C: Horrible!! Thanks for asking...
$C: Dude, you're shitting on a Dell.
$C: Thats a Depressing situation. Sorry
$C: It's an omen of something bad
$C: That’s the funniest thing I’ve seen in a long time, that poor pidgin made my day.
$C: **The Lannisters Send Their Regards.**
$C: Better than the bird's...

Edit: nice desktop selection btw.
$C: My day's certainly going better than that bird's. But it's still only afternoon.
$C: IT is gonna love hearing this story when you call them up...

Cant wait to see the other side of the conversation in /r/talesfromtechsupport
$C: I thought the bird was the turd at first then I looked again. So, you know it  could be worse. 
$C: Better than the bird's.
$C: Second depressing thing on here today...I think I’m quit the internet for the rest of the day
$C: Nice.
$C: Obviously better than the birds.
$C: So that's not how sending a Tweet works?
$C: I have that laptop too (minus the dead bird and poop)
$C: Perhaps it got exhausted from carrying a coconut.
$C: The Twitter bird :( 
$C: Technically I think that it’s called “voiding your bowels” when you shit at the moment of death.

So I guess take consolation in knowing only his location of death was intentional🤷🏻‍♂️
$C: In a way... its quite beautiful.  That creature decided to hate you so much, it spent that last moments of its life to shit on your laptop and die.  That level of loathing is to be respected.
$C: Why do people not customize their lock screens? 
$C: I just came here to say I was concerned for your obfuscation methods given that looked like it might be work. But you're looking good. I downloaded your photo and just absolutely wrecked it and found no data behind the redaction. Cheers! 
$C: Don’t do cocaine.
$C: That's shitty.
$C: That's the blue bird of happiness!
$C: what an absolute chad 
$C: I started a job at Wal-Mart.

*shivers*
$C: whatever it is you were doing on your laptop aint shit. the universe has sent the message. message received by op.
$C: Twitter’s gone extra interactive to distract users 
$C: Why does the bird look completely smushed flat?
$C: That is a powerful omen! Is it a bluebird of some kind?
$C: Question is, did you write that with or without the dead bird sitting on your keyboard? 
$C: Uhhh you may want to get a priest up in there dude. 
$C: Dude! You've got a dell!
$C: 7 days.
$C: Bummer. I like blue birds. 
$C: Transported a dying animal to another hospital, then found out a very important machine is down and we have half a dozen cases that need it.. 

oh yeah did i mention they were all emergencies? 
$C: It appears he was not the bluebird of happiness . 
$C: I have been unemployed for three months and finally had a job interview today ... On the drive home I realized my shirt was inside out. #fml 
$C: Your username is great. President Mal!
$C: Worse than that!😵
$C: Hmmm seems fake
$C: RIP Turdman Jr.
$C: Better than that, I suppose
$C: Well that can't be a good sign.
$C: That’s mayonnaise

This is FAKE!!
$C: Based on the House M.D. episodes I've seen, you're probably also going to die.
$C: Angry birds VR is no joke!
$C: r/wellthatsucks
$C: Maybe he just really doesn't like Dell and this was how he chose to express himself.
$C: This is pretty shitty.
$C: Is this what Twitter is?
$C: Got rejected from mad med schools today lol but I'm still alive so yay
$C: Thanos is coming. 
$C: Zipitty do da there’s a dead bluebird on my laptop
$C: Must be Lord Varys telling ya something

$C: Why is it flattened 
$C: Time of death: 6:35.
$C: Literally the same.
$C: That's what you get for having that stupid button thing in the middle of your keyboard that doesn't nothing but annoy me. 
$C: Aliens are about to abduct you!!!!!!!!!
$C: I was forced to read enough Shakespearean type work in high school to know you are going to die.  
$C: Oof
$C: Who says there’s no such thing as a free lunch?
$C: If you were running Linux instead it might’ve had a chance.
$C: A true keyboard warrior.

Defeated.
$C: Good morning by kanye West came on right as I opened this
$C: In my culture it's considered to be very bad luck to have a bird shit on you and then immediately die.
$C: Dude, he's going to hell...
$C: Poor bird 
$C:  Not as bad as yours. 
$C: Could be so easily staged
$C: Better than yours because screens on windows exist? Like what the hell man
$C: Better than yours I guess... sorry bud.
$C: About half as good as you
$C:  I think the birds day was Fuckin bed....
$C: This is just bizarre
$C: He flew right into your Windows.
$C: OP murdered a bird for karma.
$C: I sharted at work, so not too great
$C: So are you or are you not Peter Griffin? 
$C: Lol!!! Holy shit
$C: Insert windows joke here 
$C: Hey OP, let us know if you contract bird aids.
$C: This is how the bird flu zombie apocalypse begins
$C: That bird is no more 
$C: Oof
$C: At first this looks photoshopped
$C: But did you die? Cause your day is way better than that birds.
$C: Why u blank out what was on the paper pansy
$C: Sooooooo, what a day huh?
$C: Did it shit on your on button?😂
$C: And now you're patient zero.  Bon chance mon ami.
$C: I'm not liking this new Twitter update.
$C: Never thought I would be jealous of a bird
$C: I just picked my first pair of glasses in 10 years. Yes. I’ve only worn contacts since 2009. My eyes are thanking me now. 
$C: [Play the lotto now!!!!](http://www.theobserversvoice.com/2016/02/bird-poop-luck-and-a-lottery-ticket/)

$C: this made me laugh for quite a while, thanks! 
$C: Renew! 
$C: Dude! You’re getting a Dell!
$C: Man that's how I wanna go out 
$C: That bird is a dick
$C: Quite the shit tit 
$C: It was a juvenile, Mountain Bluebird— probably a male. Time of death recorded nicely.
$C: Unrelated, but I have the same laptop as you. Got it a few weeks back. It runs well when it’s working but sometimes it feels the need to randomly restart. Have you had this problem?
$C: That was pretty good 
$C: This made me lol
$C: It's a sign
$C: I just woke up to my 3rd day in hospital after having a lawn mower shoot a meathook into my foot. So about the same as yours. #baddaybros
$C: And you’re running Win10 - you really are having a shit day!
$C: Poor lil dude.
$C: i like to think that years ago you did something heinous to piss off this bird, so in revenge he ate the nastiest shit he could find for disease, fucked the sluttiest birds in the tree's for all the avian std's and hugged anything that died far and wide, and when he felt he was on the brink of death... he came over to give them all to you, with a shit on your laptop as an added "fuck you"

(hey, that kind of rhymed a little... that was not my intention.)
$C: At least it wasn’t a jackdaw... 
$C: Dude, you're getting a Dell
$C: The laat act of defiance against humanity.
$C: Your day hasn't finished yet. That bird died of West Nile virus (it's that season after all) and now you have it too...
$C: Time to buy a lotto
$C: That's a LOT of shit coming out of a budgie
$C: Birds are always crashing into windows.... 10
$C: Sign of times coming.
$C: That bird was poooooiiiisssoned ....
$C: Does no one have screens on their windows?
$C: Play powerball immediately. Either you're a winner, or you're dead. 
$C: Wow, people still leave windows open without screens in them?
$C: It is blue... This might be a message from Rick Sanchez... I cant help you here, youre dead in 232, 231....
$C: So a wild budgerigar just happend to fly through your window and shit on the laptop.

I call bullshit.
However congratulations on all the upvotes
$C: “I’m getting a Dell duuuuuuuuuu *thunk*
$C: ‘Huh?!’

[takes photo]

[sips coffee]
$C: Shutting likely happened with death, not before
$C: Bird's last words, "I shit on your Dell!"
$C: awww guess it just was too enthralled by what you had on your screen.  We saved a baby finch who got stuck in the bottom of the barn today.. learning to fly got caught and had a heck of a time getting it back outdoors.
$C: What if this is a message from the boyfriend who took the toilet after the break up?
$C: I feel like that birds day was worse than yours.. 
$C: thats an omen if ive ever seen one
$C: Your day is still going better than the bird's day.
$C: It’s because you touch yourself, isn’t it?
$C: I'm guessing it needed whyfly.
$C: Lmao

$C: You know what they say... When a bird shits on you, it is good luck.
Bro, or lady bro, you are going to have good luck for years to come. 
$C: Looks like a parakeet 

$C: Where's its legs?
$C: Are you a wizard? That bird clearly has a message for you from Sirius Black. 
$C: According to an old wives' tale (care of my Mom), it is VERY bad luck when a bird flies into a window you are sitting by. It's even worse luck if the bird dies. Now, because the bird landed on your laptop, pooped, then died, my calculations suggest you should stay where you are for at least 6 months. RIP pretty bird. 
$C: At least you're not the bird.
$C: I have screens, so not too bad.
$C: five years ago a bird used to visit me everyday, did it each day three years. a few times it enter in my room also. one day...it dissapeared and never came back. it was a beutiful bird. 
$C: r/birdsbeingdicks
$C: Aww it didn’t want to die alone. Aww
$C: I love Tuesdays!
$C: Just like that but metaphorically.
$C: You got free food. 
$C: Sorry about your day!
$C: Better than yours, at a guess.
$C: How long to repost? What other possible titles? 
$C: Decapitated. Whole big thing.  We had a funeral for a bird. 
$C: Yeah just throw out that laptop
$C: My daughter kicked out one of my teeth and almost knocked me out from headbutting my nose so hard during separate meltdowns; and very suddenly today, I now have $1500 in bills due by the 24th that I definitely don't have the money for, lol. And I've had to start my mornings at 2am for the past month all because of the sensory issues my daughter is experiencing. 

But!

I'm still feeling pretty grateful for all the non-material sweetness in life. Like watching my 3.5 year old daughter ask to be Kiss for Halloween, or that fact that I got to save a box turtle in traffic this week! I was able to experience a super compassionate and educational moment of my daughter's life through that. :-)

So overall it feels like a Tuesday. Lol
$C: see someone has been using windex
$C: I hate when birds fly into windows.
$C: holy crap ... or mayb just CRAP lol
$C: That was one fat shit
$C: I thought the bird was just shy
$C: The opposite of a Disney princess

$C: It's going better than that birds is lol
$C: Better than that bird
$C: Damn 
$C: Blue bird of crappiness.
$C: You need to do some sort of superstitious ritual now.
$C: My bird shits on my keyboard daily
$C: My day sucks, my bird flew away.....
$C: Aw, it chose you.
$C: Witness me! 
$C: Fun fact - that's piss too.  Birds expel the lot together.
$C: Do you have ProSupport with Accidental Damage? Your Latitude may need some.
$C: So you do shit yourself when you die. 🤔
$C: That'd be a great commercial for Apple 
$C: I guess he had one last thing on his bucket list... 
$C: Aint that something!  Wow
$C: This right here is my fucking life story. 
$C: I don't know man, call in a ticket
$C: You have bird flu now 
$C: Looks like you’re not the only one running windows at your place 
$C: your favorite dead uncle was in that bird as a spirit and went through all heck to get to you.  but tragically you uncle doesn't know how to bird very well and forgot to eat and drink enough and you have what we have here.  pretty obvious.  
$C: I'm new to Reddit and am like "wtf"
I cant even. 
Need more time!!!!
$C: Was its heart beating, Toby? Did you check it? No, of course you didn't. You're not a veterinarian. You don't know ANYTHING!
$C: My cat threw up on my gym clothes and rain jacket then I tore my work dress shirt on a light switch cover plate. 
$C: I shit my pants again today. Was waiting in the parking lot before my Dr.'s appointment and my ulcerative colitis kicked in. With no bathroom in sight i had to rush to a nearby porta-potty. Long story short, I had to clean up the mess i made in the porta potty with see-thru toilet paper. Got some on my hands, and had nothing to wash my hands with. 
$C: r/nevertellmetheodds
$C: O Dell beakem Jr has entered the conussion protocol
$C: Pretty apt for that machine.
$C: So... call the local CDC by the way. Bet the bird carries West Nile.
$C: Erik Cartman was right!
$C: Just what did you do to Mother Nature for her to send suicide birds to crap on your life? 
$C: Is this a Lenovo ad? 
"Dell computers kill birds! Buy Lenovo!"
$C: Well, it died doing what it loved...
$C: This bird is no more. It has ceased to be!
$C: He died doing what he loved. Shitting on laptops. 
$C: Well, it is a Dell.....
$C: Lucky bird - that’s how.  :(
$C: Ctrl-Alt-Del to stop bird.exe and shit.bat
$C: Haystack Rock in Oregon for a wallpaper! Nice choice!
$C: Not as bad as that bird's.
$C: He was probably like "well, i gotta do this one last solid for my people before i am out" 
$C: From Freebird to Tuesdays gone
$C: Hi patient zero
$C: Tire pressure warning went on in my car,  but when i check, all 4 tires are equally at the specified pressure.
$C: MeIRL
$C: Im just going to assume it means you’re coming into a shit ton of luck. All three on their own are good omens, so the trifecta must mean something great!
$C: I got stung in the neck 4 times by a hornet, twice on the top of the head and once on the elbow all before 8am. So looks like you and I are on different boats but treading the same water 
$C: And here I thought you voided your bowels AFTER you die. I guess it doesn't always happen in that order.
$C: Maybe next time you should close out of your...Windows.  I’ll show myself out.
$C: Better than that birds

$C: Bird WAS the word
$C: Similar 
$C: I am stuck  in Bocas del Toro, Panama and there is no way out of here as there is a general strike and there is no transportation.

I'd trade with you in heartbeat.
$C: This should be in wtf
$C: At least it was a dell... 
$C: How do you think the birds day is going huh
$C: Where are the bird's legs?

$C: You think your day is bad? My pet bird flew away this morning and never came home. He always comes home within an hour and I’m getting worried.
$C: At least it didn't get in between the keys
$C: Is that an African or European Swallow?
$C: I’m pretty sure that’s a bad omen
$C: Better than the bird's
$C: They say you shit your pants right after you die 
$C: Sure you didn't just snap when it took a shit?
$C: Stop trolling! 

I will continue doing so alone without you.
$C: I'm having a shitty day too, no pun intended, but you gave me a good laugh that I needed. Thanks!
$C: Mmm, free lunch!
$C: probably bc it's a dell
$C: Your cursed dude 
$C: Well it’s like someone tweeted you a death threat. 
$C: eat it
$C: Sue dell for killing animals
$C: Its a sign!!!
$C: Are you gonna finish that?
$C: What a shitty way to die.
$C: Why does it look so flat?
$C: He was dying already, was on agony and that's why sh*t. Poor guy. 
$C: Probably just trying to check webMD
$C: Deep
$C: I'm sick to death of Trump today... but you win hands down with the dead bird. 
$C: I have parrots. They shit on my laptop every chance they get, and they know that as much as I threaten to kill them, they won't die.
$C: About the same.
$C: dead birds often symbolize change or an end to a long struggle. Obviously in this case it means you'll soon get a replacement for your crappy shit-covered laptop.
$C: My cat shit where he was laying on my desk and is lethargic. Hopefully he doesn't die too. Other than that my day was meh. 
$C: I think that's some sort of omen 
$C: Welcome to the 21st century.
$C: You can clean it all up with some rocks from outside... you know... 2 birds with one stone... 
$C: I thought the bird was a massive shit smear... it took me way too long to realise what i was looking at. 
$C: No one else mentioned r/WTF ?
$C: Not bad. Better than the bird's.
$C: My cat does this all the time minus the dying part
$C: Cats are getting crafty with their murder framing these days
$C: He must have had Taco Bell. 
$C: It’s meditating leave it alone 
$C: It was going really badly. Not that badly
$C: This is a new Windows 10 feature
$C: So...you have a laptop?
$C: Pretty good. A bird shits on your computer??? Make that Great!
$C: Pretty sure you caught that bird, tortured it until it shat on your Laptop and then you left it to die there to take a picture for Karmafarming on Reddit. That seems a lot more plausible. Yes. Indeed.
$C: Its a bad omen to have a bird fly through your window
$C: That is a house sparrow they are not supposed to be blue someone spray painted it and that ended up killing the bird.  Birds don’t just die for no reason.  I have heard some people think nature is rebelling from our toxins and trying to communicate with us. 
$C: You are a suspect!
$C: Sell it to a blind kid.
$C: That's what you get for running Windows.
$C: It feels like a Stephen King book. Or a Game of Thrones parody/
$C: Did you squish it or does it just look that way?
$C: Well birds do have a tendency to fly into Windows.
$C: My mother would lose her shit due to that old wives tale.
$C: Ari??
$C: Something brought him there. Call it fate, destiny ~~a horse ~~. And then decided to self-destruct for good.
$C: What the f?
$C: I wanna die like that bird
$C: Someone hacked my bank account and stole every dollar I have and my bank let them do it
$C: For a second when reading the caption, i thought it was a parody for “Put Your Records On” by Corinne  Rae. 
$C: What if this post is staged and he killed the bird and put it on his laptop. Birds just don’t do that sort of shit
$C: Pretty shitty. My girlfriend and I broke up today.
$C: That's how I want to go out 
$C: I think you murdered that bird

burderer
$C: Aww, looks like a fledgling bluebird, too. Poor little guy.
$C: Not a interesting as yours. 
$C: Well I tried to put my cat in her carrier and ended up chasing her around the couch only to slip off of it to break my foot. 
$C: This is like someone’s first day of college
$C: It flew into windows
$C: I once had a bird fly into my window and bleed out on a cloth chair on my porch. I had to clean the window, pick up a dead bird and I ended up throwing the chair out because the blood wouldn't come out of the fabric. So I would say I know your pain dude.
$C: You're allowed to swear on the internet, mom won't find out I promise.
$C: Bird up!
$C: I think we all know what happened here. Your pet bird shit on your laptop and in a fit of rage you killed him and posted it here as some random, crazy phenomenon.
$C: Still alive.
$C: Are you from the future? Its currently 2:18pm here in California
$C: Birds day: He was desperate to find help, injured and knew he was going to die. He flew into an open window, hoping the human might help. Unfortunately he lost his bowels on landing and made a mess. The human then watched him die with a disgusted look on his face. 
$C: These things happen. I once walked in my room and there was pigeon sitting on my laptop screen. Took me ages to get the bastard out. Those days my internet was super slow and later I started thinking that maybe it was homing pigeon sent to me from my ISP to be used for large file transfers.
$C: Poor buddy, looks like he got some paint on him. Probably why he died. Rip birb
$C: Yesterday I tried to help a cat that got stuck in our fence and didn’t think to put on gloves which lead to me being bitten, scratched and mildly mauled 😂 had to go to the ER for a tetanus booster some bandages and a lesson learned. Wear some oven mitts next time 
$C: This is absolutely the funniest thing I’ve seen this year.
$C: I hope everyone's day is at least better than the bird's.
$C: Same
$C: Well.... I don't own a Dell at least.  Lol
$C: Dude lol I got that same exact laptop+screensaver+desk color combo
$C: Some days your the bird, somedays your the guy who gets his laptop shit on
$C: So.... what are you thinking of naming him?
$C: Better than that bird's.
$C: I guess that confirms it, when you die, poop leaves the butt...
$C: This is a sign that announce plague. Or a very cold winter...
$C: You scared the shit out of it and to death!!
$C: odds are the bird had a worse day than you
$C: WITNESS MEEEEEE!!

Also, you could've cropped out that paper ✌️
$C: Ah, fuckin flew into Windows 10.

Close Windows to resolve the problem.  I might consider switching to 7 Windows rather than 10.
$C: My day is going about like this, but without the bird. That would be a symbol of hope, one way or another.
$C: Makes sense.  It's a Dell.
$C: Fuck that laptop brings back memories!
$C: Better than yours 
$C: [to save some birds and clean up **less** shit](https://windowalert.com)
$C: At least you got some karma, I suppose...
$C: he hates that surface..
$C: My day seems a lot better by comparison.
$C: Them birds always flying into Windows...
$C: Made my day 
$C: SHIT! Literally.
$C: I stepped in water with my socks on, think my day is worse tbh 
$C: You might want to report this to your local town/city government. 

If you are in the US, the Center for Disease Control keeps track of animal deaths especially when they just die like this for no reason. 

Diseases like the West Nile Virus are moving northward in the US and reporting incidents like this help the CDC and local governments track its progress and work on a plan to eradicate it.
$C: I just found out i'm adopted.
$C: Found the disney princess
$C: Shakespeare esq 
$C: This is the beginning of the end. The damn feathered demons have brought the avian flu right to your lap.
$C: Ah, it likes flying into Windows 
$C: My day is alright. I'm getting some stuff done. Minimal interruptions.

I see that Infinity War is available to rent. I think I'll watch it tonight.

Sorry about the bird. I hope your day gets better.

Edit: was that question rhetorical?
$C: 😂😂😂
$C: Better now. Thanks. 
$C: Birds do bizarre things. I had a similar situation that happened to me while I was waiting for a morning class during high school. A bird flew towards a window making a loud thud, fell to the ground, and died in front of me. 
$C: Is that a blue jay?
$C: I'm not having the greatest day, but definitely not having a "fowl window shit die" kind of day.
$C: You should have saved it. You're just as guilty as Omarosa.
$C: I’m in Disneyland!”
$C: All said and done, at least your day is going better than the birds. So you got that going for you at least lol
$C: Be easy on the little guy. Probably shit right in the middle of having a heart attack or something 
$C: So Cartman was right? You DO shit one last time..
$C: Wtf I have the exact same laptop 
$C: He's pining for the fjords
$C: Since no one else said it. My day isnt going great but seems to being alot better than yours. Thanks for asking! Also at least your day cant get much worse. I hope. And now you've got all that sweet karma!
$C: It could be worse.....you could be the bird.........or the laptop  :)
$C: I think this is how some crazy viral pandemic starts. 
$C: My day's more or less irrelevant. I wanna know why it looks like the bugger is burrowing it's head within the mouse. Dude, I think it's a hacker.
$C: **[The song to accompany the picture](https://youtu.be/JnbtV5x5AEo).**
$C: My dad had the same laptop, it broke down within a year, jw hows yours working

$C: I’ve actually heard of something like this. In order to undo this bad omen, you have to lick the poop off your laptop.
$C: Im doing alright. Cept my bird flew off and i cant find em.
$C: I thought he was going to make a joke about the bird that flew against his Windows. Is there a subreddit for missed jokes?
$C: Had an iPhone 6 battery blow up in my hand. Thanks for asking.
$C: Well good thing it's a Dell 
$C: Decided... Hmmm🤔
$C: It thought it finally reached the promise land... and it turned out to be a screensaver. 
$C: What kind of porn kills a bird on sight?
$C: Well it's better than that bird's day, that's for sure.
$C: Sorry, I tweeted some shit and needed to delete it.
$C: Bird stomach flu. 
$C: It isn’t dead, it’s sleeping.
$C: Was that the bluebird of happiness?
But seriously, I read that sometimes birds that fly into windows fly away afterwards but then may die later of internal injuries. Could be a delayed reaction.
$C: As far as portents go... that's a doozy.
$C: I'd burn some sage up in that room if I were you, there's some serious mojo in that house you are not equipped to deal with.
$C: Same thing happened to me. But in an order that would surprise you.
$C: I guess he took your comment get your shit out of here literally.
$C: Well it's not like it wasn't already crap before the bird flew into it. It's running Windows 10 after all
$C: Better than that. Fuck. 
$C: That's what you get for buying a Dell. 
$C: Guess he didn't like your tweet.
$C: Well obviously not as good as yours.
$C: OP, give us an update when this bird gets tested. Is it carrying disease? Is it chemical (like DDT)? 
$C: /mildlyinfuriating 
$C: Not going as well as yours, you had lunch delivered directly to you, for free! Must be nice.
$C:  Enter than yours apparently. 
$C: Just one of those days where you truly ask yourself just what in the fuck happened right now
$C: better than that bird's...
$C: Whole big thing.  We had a funeral for a bird. 
$C: Sounds like you're having a fowl day
$C: 635AM. Must be a Donnie tweet
$C: You cant make that up -shit
$C: Well it IS a Dell. If I had only 1 shit left to give, I'd give it right on one of those things too.
$C: Haha rip
$C: I think this means you're Paimon now.
$C: Sometimes I feel like the bird.
$C: I just go rear-ended at a stop sign in my 1968 VW camper bus. great day.
$C: Like those global pandemic movies, OP is patient zero.
$C: I think it's time to just throw the whole computer away wooow, they say it's good luck if a bird shits on you, how about shit on your computer and die.?
$C: Dude this happened to me like 2 months ago while buckling up my 2 year old. Canary crash lands in my front seat and dies while bleeding out of its beak.
Thought it was pretty ominous at the time because a crow was cawing from the top of a telephone pole.
My dad later explained it was probably fighting for territory with the crow, and I felt much better.
$C: Reason for new laptop request: Current one now has some kind of gypsy curse or the like. (See attached image)
$C: This is a message from the Overlord.  Be warned.
$C: When the technology kill's the environment 😉
$C: i tought it was a paper cutout of a bird 
$C: By the time I got to “sh*t on my laptop” I thought you were gonna finish this by saying “I closed my laptop on it”
$C: My condolences...
$C: Fucking lol nice treat
$C: My day is definitely going better than yours. 
$C: Better than that bird anyhows 
$C: I think somebody may have used a sling shot to kill the bird which happened to fly through your window and die.  Sorry if this were already mentioned.
$C: Scared shitless!!!!
$C: guys this is the best opportunity to kill the bird who shat on your computer and then blame it on #justnaturalthings
$C: ✌🏿
$C: "And decides to die"

 Poisoned by his enemies, huh?
$C: I upvoted this because it's the first post containing original content I've seen in days
$C: I'm not a bird-poopolagolist but that thing doesn't look like a bird poop
$C: Coming by the pub for a couple?

Na mate, gotta fly home, dying for a shit.
$C: THE SOUTH PARK THING IS TRUE!!!! YOU DO POO WHEN YOU DIE!!!!
$C: r/madlad
$C: Fake. You made the bird shit on your computer before you killed it. 
$C: r/natureismetal
$C: When your bluebird of happiness goes tits up!
$C: Good omen ? 
$C: > The shit that finaly bloody kills you.
$C: More like shitter notifications 
$C: Bad omen! 
$C: Get a MacBook
$C: Might want to contact someone who specializes in bird law to see if you are entitled to compensation. 
$C: Id shit and die too if I seen someone using a Dell
$C: my day is definitely not going as bad as ... the birds. 
$C: This is how I would want to go.
$C: Did you eat it or what?
$C: Oh YUCK! its a Dell..
$C: There goes the bluebird of happiness... 
$C: Pretty good thanks for asking
$C: Im sleepy but now im awake
$C: Better than the birds
$C: This is so sad, play Despacito 2
$C: r/CasualConversation
$C: The things people are doing for karma are getting crazy!!!
$C: F
$C: I would like to see you reaction when this whole this was happening 
$C: Not dead, resting
$C: This moment of zen/solidarity coming across my phone just now... is the true calling for push notifications.
$C: Right in the volume control keys. 

Btw I have the same laptop, which company your work for? 
$C: This guy must live in Europe. I'm from there and I can't believe I lived all those years without  mesh screens on my windows.

If I ever move back I'm putting them up on all my windows, I don't want any creepy crawlies or dying birds with explosive diarrea to fly into my house. 
$C: Statey pulled me over for turning like an idiot but let me off with a warning. So okay so far! 
$C: r/wellthatsucks
$C: That's a real stand up bird, one last fuck you before he heads to hell. 
$C: Toby killed this bird
$C: Looks like this bird just tried to update Windows 10. 
$C: 6% better than that.  Thank you.
$C: Better than yours. So sorry 😮
$C: Windows is literally shit these days
$C: How does this fit r/pics? Perhaps r/wellthatsucks would fit better.
$C: Apparently not as good as you.🙈
$C: Give it a proper burial. For all we know it could be an ancestor's spirit in a different form that found you.
$C: Scared the shit out of him
$C: That's worth two in the bush, y'know
$C: This is gonna be the top post of all time.....isn’t it?
$C: r/wtf
$C: I really did think i was having a bad day until i saw this. 
$C: The bird had one last thing to do before it died. I guess it just had to get it out of his system. 
$C: I tried to pay off my washer & dryer this morning; instead of that though they had to call an ambulance for me for what ended up being the most horrific anxiety attack I've had in 3yrs. I found that out after 7hrs in er being tested for the everything. 
$C: It’s my birthday.
$C: It looks like it flew in your Windows.
$C: I wonder what the hell it was trying to get away from 
$C: I hate when that happens. 
$C: At least it didn't shit in your keyboard. 
$C: "Remember me!" 
$C: well the starter in my car just died and the milage check from my work that was supposed to be ready yesterday isnt going to be ready untjl thursday and npw i have a $300 size hole in my bank account and i have to do all the work myself... so... shitty
$C: He clearly had some kind of beef with Dell and wanted one last strike before he died, after he was laid off.
$C: Could be it came in to be your friend but saw you're using a Dell and it was offended so bad it shit on it then had a heart attack and died.
$C: Well, your day is going better than the bird’s🤷‍♀️
$C: My day is going well.
$C: This is an omen of some sort
$C: I'm pretty sure if his lockscreen wasn't up we'd see what it was that scared the shit out of that poor critter and then gave it a heart attack.
$C: My s/o has been pretty reckless with my car lately and reversed into a pillar in an empty parking lot smashing the side window (a small one in front of the mirror) and leaving bad scratches and a nasty dent in the door. The mirror is also not straight anymore. But I read my car insurance policy and I was sold-up and suckered into comprehensive cover along with the optional car hire so the only excess appears to be age related so that seems positive. 
$C: He saw the Windows through a Window.  
$C: Dude you’re getting a new Dell!
$C: Is your name really JaMolly?! That is hilarious
$C: A random street cat jumped into my bedroom through my open window, but he left as soon as I noticed him. 
$C: Wow.
$C: Pretty sure it died of bird flu if it did that. I would go to Dr asap. 
$C: Oh no, it’s happening!
$C: You now have bird flu. Good luck
$C: BIRD UP
$C: What type of bird is it?
$C: A bird shit on my laptop so I killed it where it stood.
$C: Did you get that thing I sent yah?
$C: Amazing
$C: That bird looks like it got run over a dozen times by a steamroller. Seriously, did you smash that bird on your laptop lid?
$C: Poor little guy shit his brains out.
$C: Shit on the bird, that'll show him
$C: Remember that time some kids fed laxatives to birds and the comments said 'don't do that they'll shit themselves to death'?.

Yeah
$C: Better than the bird, that's for sure.
$C: I’m the bird. 
$C: More importantly, how old is that laptop?
$C: Maybe it thought that Windows was an actual window you could fly out of
$C: [Almost the same thing happened to me](https://i.imgur.com/PEccKnb_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium) except that fucker managed to hit my screen and actually got away with it
$C: So, birds do this thing where they lay on the ground with their wings spread out to warm themselves in the sun.  My friend is nuts about birds so she's constantly posting photos she's taken of birds doing this (outside).  I have accused her many times of dragging a dead bird around and posing it for her Insta.  Any chance he's just ... warming himself on your laptop?
$C: Hey...you’re patient zero!
$C: I can't stop laughing. But I do feel terrible that happened to you lol...
$C: Eat it
$C: Gotta give that bird a proper burial
$C: Maybe the shit was too hard to push out for the bird and it died like how some people die when they give birth 
$C: Lmao. 
$C: The Aflockalypse has begin. 
$C: You could sell it to the blind neighbor boy for snack money. 
$C: Ladies and Gentlemen- Bird Tywin Lannister
$C: Well, atleast we have the same login screen wallpaper.
$C: You know, that's a sign. A sign of what you may ask? A sign, that the world fucking hates you.
$C: r/talesfromtechsupport
$C: It must be because it ran into your WINDOWS computer 
$C: I think he died of embarrassment 
$C: To be fair, your day is going better than the bird’s. 
$C: Bad luck, expect some bad shit to happen 
$C: So living things  do release they're bowels after they die!
$C: I flew into a window, shit on a laptop and died. RIP me. 
$C: Probably died from lack of legs, poor little bugger.
$C: This is good for Bitcoin
$C: R/wtf
$C: Looks like a pretty bird
$C: Decapitated. Whole big thing. We had a funeral for a bird. 
$C: I suggest throwing your laptop into a river to dispose of it. Then it would be a Dell rolling in the deep.
$C: It flew in the window to shit on you Windows machine. Soon a penguin will come through your window and install Linux.
$C: I found my dog dead in the sideyard this morning, so not too great. Had her for 14 years. 
$C: 110k ups wow
$C: bruh get a priest to cleanse your house
$C: DethNote
$C: He didnt want to die alone =(
$C: Teaching your bird to shit on command and play dead is very impressive.
$C: “BECKY, LEMME SMASH,”  
flies into the room,
kills himself

$C: Youre some sort of trash tier disney princess.
$C: Guess hes not a fan of Windows 10.
$C: Become an EDM artist and call yourself DeadB1rd.
$C: “Yo rigby check this out”
$C: I guess it flew in your window and on your Windows.
$C: Been destroying any ancient relics or anything?
$C: This bid just had a seizure on this guy’s computer😂
$C: Better than the birds.
$C: R.I.P.
$C: He missed the windows. Badumtss
$C: Otherwise good (vehicless) friend of mine called asked if I wanted to go to the mall i said yes thought we was gonna chill his ass is playing Pokemon go and I'm sitting on a bench in this dead ass mall 
$C: r/nevertellmetheodds
$C: um what are the symptoms of bird flu ? 
$C: Maybe don’t put a dying bird on your laptop?
$C: Kinda crap knowing you that happened
$C: You're like the Anti Disney Princess.  Stay away from squirrels and deer.
$C: Pretty good.
$C: You should play ADell songs at its funeral service 
$C: I think you might be cursed. 
$C: 
Much better than yours. I only had to drive 2 hours into work but no deaths in the process
$C: AND scribbled out your paper work. What a twat.

$C: Hey! I use that same background!
$C: That's some freaky witchcraft
$C: When you said it flew through your window I thought you meant windows and you were making a joke about the computer lol

$C: The only thing that comes to mind is " The Happy  Prince " by Oscar Wilde. 
$C: The bluebird of happiness? No... the bluebird of crapiness.
$C: PLEASE CALL ANIMAL CONTROL!! That bird is likely diseased.
$C: It dodged the first window but hit the second
$C: The death shit followed by the death faceplant. 
$C: The universe is telling you something, not sure what, but something.
$C: Fuck! I have that same pc and I love it. It is such a shitty thing to happen to that pc 
$C: Whatever you were working on... maybe start over.
$C: Better than yours, tbh.
$C: Sounds like a bad omen or something.
$C: Well, my notebook went kaputt last year and since I can't find a job, cannot afford a new one. There was a big storm today, my room's and the kitchen's wall are totally wet. Anyway it was an average depressing day. 
$C: Well.. clearly not as lucky as you. You now have a cool story for life.
$C: This reminds me of one of those parasites that makes a mouse less afraid of cats or a grasshopper jump into water in order to facilitate it's spread.

Is there a mind control parasite for which the bird is a carrier that spreads to humans through bird shit before it kills the birds?

Go to a doctor, Patient Zero.
$C: I would say the bird is having a better day than me because at least it's dead.

$C: How dare he decide to die right in front of you that’s just inconsiderate
$C: We need someone well-versed in bird law. We could have a bird murder on our hands here. 
$C: obviously-- your day is going better than the bird 
$C: Good, thanks for asking
$C: Dell has that effect on people
$C: He shat on his own grave
$C: Thank you for that perspective. I need that.
$C: Maybe it means you're currently being poisoned by CO2. S.O.S. Send Help.
$C: Dude ...you’re getting a dell

$C: My day is not bad.... A laptop shit on my bird

$C: My wife had a bird suddenly drop dead in a tree and hit her mid fall while she was riding down a hill on her bicycle.  She did not hit it mid flight.  It fell straight down and hit her face.
$C: I wouldn't google if that's a sign if I were you


$C: My lucky charms had extra rainbow marsh mellows so pretty great so far
$C: Dell latitude... serves you right
$C: Then universe is trying to tell you that your posts suck.🤣
$C: He flew in your window and crashed into windows. 
$C: Like yours, a hell of a lot better than the bird’s day
$C: Don’t threaten me with a good time...
$C: But dude you got a Dell
$C: Oh dear. Not a great day for you, is it? Even a  worse day for the bird that died! 😢
$C: Natural is metal. My day is slow going. Hotel life. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
$C: Known issue with Dell.
$C: The bird last wish was to shit on a laptop. 
$C: Shouldn't have got a Dell...
$C: It’s my birthday 
$C: Lmaoooooooooooooooooooooo
$C: Wow I have the same computer and background... I could pass this off as mine
$C: Eh, pretty decent day thanks for asking
$C: I had something like this happen once. I worked at a nursing home and a bird got in when our shift change was happening. I was tasked with getting the bird out and noticed it was not trying to fly away from me even though it flew in. I picked it up and let it perch on my finger. It was the end of my shift so I just took it out as I was going home but it would not fly or anything. 

I thought it might have been hurt or something even though there were no visual signs of being hurt so I decided to take it home and take it to the vet the next morning since it was past 1 am.  It stayed perched on my finger in my truck the whole way home.  

When I got home I walked in and went into my living room where I had a empty box from a ups delivery by my couch. As I sat down on the couch with the bird still perched on my finger and got ready to set it down in the box it pooped on my knee and fell over dead off my finger and onto the floor. 
$C: Nah, he's just pining for the fjords.
$C: Weord, ive thtown away two brids, both hit my dirty glass windows dying instantly, one literally within five minutes of waking up, and i have. Asleep consitionz so waking up is ludaxeisly hard, but for damn sure that spooked me the fuck up... odd, has anyone else had this issue?
$C: Nevermore
$C: Must’ve had a wild night, rip.
$C: I really hope that you didn't fake this picture
$C: A hummingbird literally just flew into my window as I read this, broke its neck and died in front of me and my cat. My day is also NOT great.
$C: F
$C: Maybe the bird was obsessed with you all the time :(
$C: Something, something... Flew into your Windows 10...
$C: Whenever you're having a bad day, think of this post.
$C: r/natureisfuckinglit
$C: Probably just wanted to get up close with a human before it died and tell it what it thought of us.
$C: Literally shit his brains out. 
$C: Apparently, birds shitting on something is lucky. So I'd put that shit on eBay immediately. 

The laptop I mean, not the actual shit. That would be...uh...a bit specialist for eBay 
$C: Give it a proper funeral. I’ll bring my recorder. 
$C: It really be like that sometimes
$C: I'm guessing that it shit as it died
$C: You didnt happen to buy it from two guys in a dog car?
$C: Was that or “you killed him”??  🔫😵🤫
$C: I find it hard to believe. I think you were pissed off at the bird for pooping on your keyboard and decided to brutally squash the poor guy to death by slamming the screen on him.
$C: Yeah just sometimes life does not give you lemons, but it gives you a dead bird who shits on your laptop.

^(But that's okay, life goes on.)
$C: Beautiful plumage
$C: Love your Windows 10! 
$C: What a day I'm having! I picked up my shirt, a button fell off. I picked up my briefcase, the handle fell off. I'm afraid to go to the bathroom!
RIP Rodney Dangerfield.
$C: That is what happens when you watch too much porn😭😭
$C: A tad better that I’d say 😂
$C: Avenge him!!
$C: Tell the truth! It came in, shit on your laptop, and you killed it in a fit of rage.
$C: Looks like you scared the shit out of it... or did you scare it to death? ...both?
$C: At least it has the courtesy to sh*t away from the keyboard... 
$C: What do you do if a bird shits on your laptop? Don't bring her home again.
$C: Not too bad.
$C: Serves you right for using a Dell.
$C: Has I walk in the valley of windows and laptop, I shall shit on your stuff.

Die Bart Die!!


$C: Dell Latitude:  toilet cemetery for birds since 2013
$C: So that’s what happens when a bird flies at the wrong latitude. 
$C: the poor thing was trying to fly into your screensaver
$C: Eat shit and die
$C: It’s just pining for the fjords!
$C: So, now we got to the point of killings birds and faking their suicide por internet points?
$C: Kinda held hostage. Hopefully I’ll get to leave tomorrow 
$C: f
$C: I was meant to be going on a few days' holiday tomorrow (in about 9 Hours), to somewhere I've wanted to go for years. Except we've just had to cancel due to family illness. I'm now sitting on my case drinking tea and moping.

So, not great.
$C: It's bird-life
$C: Hmm, I wonder if this was the bird's bucket list, fly into a humans house and go out with a shitbang.
$C: this should be the new carbon tax.
$C: And then it drew all over your paperwork with a black marker?    
   
Can your day get any worse? 
$C: Doesn't this mean you're going to die in 7 days?
$C: *"A bird flew in my window, shit on my Windows..."

FTFY
$C: How sad, poor thing
$C: If you think your day is horrible, I bet the bird would swap with you. 
$C: Hahahaha it flew into your windows and died from a virus. So much for the Mac is better crowd, can Apple do pest control like this?
$C: Good, thanks. 
$C: It’s a sign from god~ man. God didn’t do that! You did it.  You’re a fucking narcotics agent! 
$C: The shit and dead animal most smell fowl.
$C: It just died?  With no help from you?  Dude, I'd bag that bird (while wearing gloves) and give it to your local DNR for testing.
$C: Sorry to hear about that I never heard of that before my first time here when something like that
$C: I'm a hardcore Lenovo man myself.  Can't really blame the bird.
$C: Better than yours apparently 
$C: /r/nevertellmetheodds
$C: Is that a dell 7480? Trying to guess the model the bird died on.
$C: Oh no... sorry to hear that, patient zero.
$C: You should start making Electronic music,and call yourself 
Dead3ird
$C: Ever heard of a screen?
$C: I lost my house/car keys and I'm very sad
$C: You should probably not leave the house today. 

$C: Does this mean your deleted your twitter account?
$C: Bird- "Thanos is coming!". 
Proceeds to shit and die.
$C: I hope you posted this and instantly logged out and see your karma tomorrow.
What a way to start the day.
$C: OP is now Patient Zero.
$C: What the fuck
$C: You know, honestly? Not quite that bad in comparison... I mean, it wasn't by any means great, but it certainly was not THAT bad.
$C: I'd say it was staged, but who the fuck would dream up this scenario?
$C: I mean I just became homeless so..... Eh
$C: I’m calling it. Time of death, 6:35
$C: Forth day of battling myself if I can live with gf after finding out about her two romances and multiple cheats. 
$C: I once was driving and heard a thump but notice any different. When I got to my house and got out of my truck I saw half of a bird stuck to my ladder rack and flapping in the wind. I followed the trail of entrails to the bad of my truck and found the other half of the bird. At least your bird is still in one piece.
$C: lol
$C: If I’ve ever played an rpg you are the chosen one.  They will contact you soon...
$C: This is basically the rise and fall of my confidence in each new writing project. Inspiration flies in, I unload on my keyboard, and then I lose all hope.
$C: I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself 
A blue bird will drop dead on a laptop
Without ever having felt sorry for itself 
$C: Really shit the bed on that one...
$C: It‘s actually been really great, thx for asking!
I‘ve overcome an anxiety that I carried around about 2 years along. I‘m very proud of myself to be honest cause it was really hard for me to overcome by myself. Have a nice day sir.
$C: Reincarnated IT person.
$C: Better than that birds. 
$C: Sell it to the blind kid next door.
$C: Ha! Classic 
$C: That was a weird decision.
$C: Nice
$C: "They dont tell you how they all shit themselves when they die."

- Bobby B
$C: It's a Dell. Obviously, the bird was trying to tell you something. 
$C: You have died of ~~dysentery~~ West Nile Virus.
$C: Ok it's not a race but so far my day is kind of winning.
$C: Did the bird die from blunt trauma? If not, you should report the bird to your local health department, as it may have been infected with West Nile Virus. 
$C: It's an omen buy Apple 
$C: Dell will fix that right up for you. Pack it in a box, ship it and it’ll come me back in six months the exact same. 
$C: Or it died then shit.
$C: Where was this? If in the U.S. it looks like a female Western Bluebird, but hard to tell.
$C: At least he shit on the area that's easier to clean. This is a prime example of the old 'it could've been worse' cliche.
$C: A bird shat himself and died, and yet all you can think about is how this reflects a bad day for you.
$C: "What are you doing with that dead bird" ?

"Shut up Karen its for the internet" 
$C: Keyboard caper!
$C: I'll take the laptop off your hands
$C: Wait maybe it's a new computer virus called Avaryon flu virus
$C: Damn it...I laughed out loud at work in a quiet 80's type of office where laughter isn't allowed. 
$C: You now have bird flu or some other nasty shit...
$C: Did you name it Adele?
$C: Must’ve died of embarrassment 
$C: :(
$C: The bird couldn't make it to the bathroom in time :(
$C: r/FunnyAndSad
$C: Its my 21st birthday and that bird is me after tonight
$C: What did you do to deserve that? I mean, thats a bad omen for sure. Better get on webMD
$C: Rubber gloves, a bag and some lysol wipes. Go about your day.
$C: Never laughed so good in a while. Thank you.
$C: They don't tell you about when they shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. 
$C: Related story time!

It was me and my boyfriend’s anniversary and we decided to go out to the Marriott in San Diego. We were having a drink at the outside bar when suddenly a seagull crashed into a woman and then into a glass plane. The seagull pushed everything on her table everywhere and made a giant mess. There was food all over her area and the seagull was distraught and was flailing. The lady was screaming and someone tried to help her. The seagull flew away nearby, threw up, and flew away again. Then a bunch a seagulls came and ate the throw up. 

Me and my boyfriend were trying so hard not to laugh at how ridiculous it was seeing this. 
$C: right.... “decided to die.” we’re onto you op...
$C: this made me LOL
$C: Eat it
$C: Dude that bird could have a serious disease steralize your laptop and anything it touched. 
$C: You're the chosen one 
$C: Dude the bird just died and you're complaining about your laptop. Man what about the bird? He's dead. Get your shit together kid.
$C: This is how a pandemic begins. 
$C: Is anyone else a little suspicious that this is fake? The supposed bird waste looks like someone smeared mayonnaise on their laptop (a pile of thick bird feces like that should be dark in color [I believe the dried uric acid is what makes the remnants look white on cars] ), the blue bird looks like it's been photoshopped in (no discernible shadow, no effect on the keys, and no stray feathers anywhere from it supposedly flying in and shitting itself to death?), the guy's post history (now deleted) was blatantly self-promotional and this bird just happens to die right where he can get a picture of the time and date. I can't say for sure but to me this looks more like bullshit than birdshit.
$C: That's a bad omen. Go light a candle and do nothing for an hour.
$C: One in the hand is worth two in the bush.
$C: I got fucked by a final exam!
$C: You are really lucky. That is the blue bird of paradise!

$C: This is profoundly hilarious 
$C: Shoulda bought a Mac. 
$C: It disapproved of your choice of OS.
$C: That's wack 
$C: That must been a shit day.
$C: That's why you put tape over your windows. 
$C: I can safely say that my day is going better than that fucking bird's
$C: Flew into your WINDOWS or flew into your window? Ah, doesn't matter. 
$C: Must have been a shitty death
$C: [What shape was the poop?](https://i.redd.it/f5cmjvlfejf11.jpg)
$C: That's pee, he pissed on your stuff.
$C: That’s fucking metal.
$C: My tired eyes read this as “decided to dig”... “that’s strange”, I thought. How would a bird “dig” on a laptop? Was there food stuck between the keys?

Scroll down and see a picture of a dead bird. “Wow, that’s extreme!” Did OP really kill a bird over a bit of sh^t and some harmless digging?

Scroll back up and re-read the title. Am relieved that OP is not a savage. 
$C: Just be glad that it wasn’t a man.
$C: Pretty sure this is a message from the spirit world 
$C: Only slightly better.
$C: The bird came for your glorious stash of Foot Jerky. 
$C: This bird looks two dimensional 
$C: I had to watch 4 kittens die slowly in the past 2 days
$C: Dude, you're getting a Dell.
$C: r/BirdsBeingDicks
$C: And, thus, the Bird Flu Pandemic begins…
$C: did you touch the bird? did you touch its shit? 

please be checked for rabies right away. its the only virus that has a 100% kill rate. 
$C: I just fished 11 drowned ducklings out of my pool, my day isn’t any better, bro.
$C: You’ve got a shitty laptop lol. 
$C: Squawk! Eat my poo human....grarrrraph unggg tweet.
$C: Lol
$C: You should go out for a beer with the chick who’s ex took her toilet over in /r/wtf.
$C: About the same.
$C: Better I suppose, but I'm an optimist.
$C: There's also some more shit beside that laptop.
$C: That is pretty effed up 
$C: Wellll... better than the bird's I guess...
$C: Hey I have the same screen saver on my laptop. Different bird though. 
$C: That is one bad omen.
$C: I dont want to believe you 
$C: I went for a stroll I guess. Doesn't beat a dead bird though
$C: Fight or flight in one picture 
$C: At first glance the bird looked flat and I thought you’d closed it in your laptop 
$C: Wow, I didn't think a dell could get any better... 
$C: Not to shabby. Thanks for asking <3


( FINALLY SOMEONE ASKS HOW IM DOING DX )


All jokes aside your day can only get better :D ( hopefully )
$C: Somewhere a scientist said, "Dude, what are the chances that thing survives long enough to shit on a warm surface that is near a person.....infinitesimal.  Just close the window and put that stuff back into quarantine."
$C: Reddit automatically beeps profanity, along with your password. See:

F**ck

********

Now you try.
$C: That laptop is cursed.
$C: F
$C: If a bird pooped in my computer, he'd also decide to die. Spontaneously, after being tortured.
$C: I’m more concerned about the Prometheus black tar shit it spewed all over your desk
$C: I think he pretty sure did that shit bcz he died , muscle relaxation physiology:/
$C: Time to start over! 
$C: Is he ok? 
$C: Well... now I know that my day is going better that at least a couple other living and previously living, things....
$C: No one seems to have made the joke about the windows computer. Jesus Christ HP has really upped their hardware, can’t believe the screen isn’t even cracked
$C: Amazon's new delivery service needs some work
$C: A bad omen. 
$C: Might be a protest against Windows 10.
$C: My day is going significantly better than his, thanks for asking.
$C: That birds day is just like your laptop, shitty.
$C: Your spirit animal
$C: same, tbh
$C: It looks like it was squished in the laptop, and that’s how it died... 😳
$C: Man, the craziest thing that happened to me today was a wasp decided to free fall from the ceiling right into my till at work. So by comparison, yours, mine, and the wasp's day was a lot better than the bird's.
$C: I'd say that bird had a plan and he stuck to it.  That's how I want to go out...
$C: lmfao u must’ve smelled like shit
$C: Lovely day for it
$C: Pretty sure I can guess how it died
$C: That's a shit laptop. 
$C: Do you have a toilet? If so, I know I know a girl you should meet. 
$C: this can't be a good omen
$C: Hey in Russia that's considered good luck! Not so much in Italy.
$C: Its you . JaMoAd.... The Disney princess of Death . 
$C: Wow
$C: That'll make a great office decoration 
$C: Are you sure the bird shit itself before dying?
$C: Better than the bird’s
$C: Lololol ❤
$C: Yoooo my company gives the same laptops.  
$C: 'sup laptop twin!?
$C: r/ThatHappend
$C: I’ve had two of those three things happen to me. Twice. 
$C: It probably just hated Windows 10
$C: Windows 10 is the worst
$C: That is unfortunate 
$C: Blue screen of death, indeed. 
$C: You are now contagion number 1, the birds are finally getting revenge.

$C: In bird culture, this is considered a dick move
$C: Bird knew it was dying so it panicked and flew to a human for help but died anyways. 
$C: /r/thanosdidnothingwrong PERFECTLY BALANCED
$C: /u/xxxbentacion 
$C: If the foo shits, wear it!
$C: But did you die?
$C: Congratulations your Indian name is now Shitting Bird.
$C: Sewage backed up and flooded the office building I work in so they sent us home early to work from home the rest of the day. It was very smelly when we left. No idea if it will be clean tomorrow. 
$C: Is that Windows 10? That bird actually tried to save you. 
$C: I thought I was having it rough when I found the shed snakeskin in my data closet. You win...or lose...depending on your POV.
$C: The bird tried to do a Hedwig cosplay and failed
$C: Today I was at a customer service position and had a like 10-12 year old girl pull my hair out of a pony tail and repeatedly yank on my dreadlocks while shouting I needed to take them out or my hair would fall out.

Then she took my personal fan and ran away.
$C: Even worse, you have windows 10!
$C: This is one crazy turn of events
$C: That cable management tho!
$C: Dude! Your getting a Dell!
$C: THE PLAGUE HAS BEGUN!!
$C: Honestly my day's been pretty shit but thank you for making me laugh.
$C: Throw this in r/aww see what happens
$C: WITNESS ME!!!
$C: OOF
$C: This needs to be posted to /r/dafuq 
$C: Dude fyl. I'm sorry this happened to you. Also laughed and felt guilty.
$C: Was this ‘am’ or ‘pm’? Hindsight, your day is fucked, my friend! 
$C: Fine, thank you. 
$C: At least it’s a work laptop. 
$C: What laptop is that?
$C: What kind of bird is that? Where's it from?
$C: Shitty.
$C: Better than that bird's.
$C: R/AnimalsBeingJerks... 
$C: Deciding to die... must be nice
$C: OP Shit and killed bird on his laptop
$C: CrapTop computer
$C: Not that I believe in this kinda thing really but sounds like a bad omen lol!  No, stuff just happens. That’s all. Did u freak out? 
$C: That bird shit mayonnaise on your laptop and then sacrificed itself,  it would be a crime NOT to make an avian sammich. 
$C: I don’t know why, but this made me laugh uncontrollably. 
$C: These tweets are getting serious!
$C: That's what I call "going with a bang" 

$C: Reminds me of a certain card in Cards Against Humanity. 
$C: Probably thought it was an Alienware. 
$C: Now sell it on /r/hardwareswap
$C: But it's so pretty.... 
$C: I killed a bird last night. It flew into my grill, which scared me, but I calmed down long enough for it to scare me a second time when it worked loose and flew up over the windshield.
$C: These new emojis are getting out of hands
$C: Yea, nice try bird diddler.
$C: Better then yours id imagine 
$C: The universe downvoted you. 
$C: If it makes you feel any better I don't think it intentional shat on your laptop
$C: Oh you found my web developer. Great! Tell him he's late for work.
$C: Death Omen!!! ...J/K... have a wonderful day!
$C: I see you are about as productive as me at work...
$C: If great literature has taught me anything, it’s that this isn’t a good sign.
$C: Not as good as yours.
$C: I am that bird.
$C: Imagine seeing this when your stoned 
$C: Did it hit the fan??
$C: You sold him Petey?!?
$C: Isn't this how pandemics start?
$C: I had that same screen saver! It's relaxing, isn't it? 
$C: Cocaine is a hell of a drug
$C: You're allowed to curse on the internet, we won't tell your mom
$C: To be fair, that’s an upgrade for that computer 
$C: You got 141k upvotes. You’re doing ok for yourself pal. Now go cash in those fake internet points and get yourself a new laptop!

$C: Birb just wanted help, you failed him.
$C: Worse. I'm the ghost of that bird you're trash talking
$C: Could be worse, thanks for asking
$C: You explained it without the clean up.  
$C: Better than the bird's
$C: ....I this falls under Cosmic omen of either Death or Destruction. your either dead in afew days or worse.
$C: For once I am going to crush it in the "reddit way." 
   Now I am not really good with this internet crap but...
 I figured it out... You need to do a virus scan on your Flintstone5000BC Software. I am  glad I could help. I am old and this new stuff I am not that up to date on..but BC(Before Computers) I know my "shit."
YABBADABBA FUKKKA DOOOOooOoOoo BABY!!!!!!!
$C: Such a shitty laptop, no wonder..
$C: That is 100%  a quest giving bird, check for a tiny scroll on its leg. 
$C: "Look everyone the bluebird of happiness!"
$C: At least he didn’t shit on the keys
$C: If I've learned anything from reddit get that thing outside before the worms/parasites come out and get you when you sleep. 
$C: Was maybe trying to fly out of the other Window(s) 
$C: really? you're joking rn? 
$C: BUT WHATS ON THAT PAPER

$C: Engage Bird Flu
$C: This post is on its way to being top post of all time. 
$C: I’m more curious about what you’re hiding under those black scribbles. 
$C: I have that laptop!
$C: Ooooo that’s a bad omen.
$C: That's an omen if ever I've seen one.
$C: Day 30 of 33 Days of Summer Camp: No injuries, no majors! (All kids come with some kind of development disability, and that one instance of a "missing child" doesn't count, she never left the building!) 
$C: Damn... Not only do you have a face that can stop a clock... Shit dies after looking at you.
$C: Oof
$C: I've heard that having a bird fly into your house is an omen of death. That was a short as fuck omen.
$C: I blame global warming
$C: Wow!! Now that’s a fucked up shitty day!!!
$C: I mean, the sphincter is a muscle and it Does loosen when living things with sphincters die.  
$C: Sorry for the bird, but that’s a mountain blue bird! I would totally keep the wing ... or a feather ? And probably the skull ... #vultureculture 
$C: It's a sign to start making music. Make a mask of bird's head with X's for eyes and start calling yourself D3ADB1RD 
$C: I mean, to be fair, I think your day’s going better than that bird’s day so far.
$C: Sheesh, imagine how it feels lol. Oh wait, you can’t because it’s dead!
$C: F
$C: Sorry to hear you didn’t get accepted into Hogwarts.
$C: No one going to call out the bullshit? Ok. I will. There is "bird shit" on the desk as well, and it is kind of smeary. That's now what bird poop does when it lands. I'm pretty sure it's acrylic paint and a fake bird. 
$C: Your problem is your laptop is Dell...
$C: Bahahahahah
$C: I have the same laptop w/ the same desktop image! No bird yet tho. 
$C: it was a message
$C: I have that same laptop
$C: Actually I heard that when you die your bowels empty so that could be why the bird pooped 
$C: Now that's a bird who truly lived
$C: What a short story 
$C: The fuck....?
$C: In some countries, it's considered a compliment!
$C: I was just stood up, but on the plus side I didn't have to deal with bird shit so yeah... Could be worse.
$C: the only thing I can say is that I have the same dell laptop model 
$C: It’s ok, you can say SHIT on the internet. 
$C: Are you in McHenry???
$C: Poor birb
$C: Is there nothing that Dell can't do?
$C: OMEN!
$C: Better than yours....
$C: Its good luck for bird shitting on you.
Its bad luck for bird dying infront of you.
You are so gonna die today 😂 its conclusive.
$C: Youre now cursed
$C: You know what? This bird is dead. He died alone. The least you can do is be there for him now. 
$C: So much karma... and all for one post....
$C: So metal
$C: Pretty well.  Thanks for asking.
$C: Sage sage sage
$C: It’s an omen lol don’t go outside today OP 😂
$C: Oh yeah, I’m sure it just died aaall by itself after shitting on your laptop...
$C: Where’s its head? Did Lloyd forget to tape it back on? 
$C: Poor bird :/ poor laptop. :(
$C: Taking the Twitter app update failure notifications to a new level...

$C: Whoa. 
$C: Mom: Hey honey, pull some poultry out of the freezer when you get home from school!

Child: Okay mom
$C: the End times are near!  
$C: Better than the fucking bird....I've just shit myself today but it didnt kill me.
$C: Sell it to the blind kid next door?
$C: No, it just shit for Dell.
$C: My fiance left me...
$C: Better hope it didn't have West Nile virus. 
$C: where do you go to school?  I only know one place where you have that kind of luck...
$C: And you thought you'd have to go out for dinner :)
$C: Did you check his leg for a mystery? 
$C: How many Disney princesses did this guy piss off?
$C: Maybe it was choking on something and was hoping you'd give it the Heimlich maneuver.
$C: Just found out my son is very allergic to my dog I rescued 8 years ago.  No idea where to go from here.

You can wipe the bird shit up with some cleaner and a paper towel, both can go in the trash outside.
$C: Dell's marketing team is getting weird.
$C: is this the highest voted post ever?
$C: I chased a rabbit through a bush as a young child to find the rabbit dead and had pooped itself when I got to the other side of the bush. I must have given it a heart attack. It was a traumatic experience for me.

8 year old me is sad for you.
$C: That’s terrifying lol
$C: It died from seeing your shitty laptop. 
$C: r/techsupportgore
$C: I've been fighting a stomach bug all day. Yay. Somehow managed to fight through work.
$C: Holy shit
$C: Bird must be a Mac user
$C: Dell?
Fitting.
$C: The bird could have shit on your keyboard atleast it didn't do that 
$C: this is rick taking a shit as a bird then transfers his consciousness to OP
$C: Looks like OP is the chosen one. 
$C: well in this case you gotta show that little shit whos boss you better eat it. 
$C: looks like a pretty old budgie, if their not indigenous to the area it might be that someones pet escaped
$C: Was it the bird that scribbled all over your work in front of the laptop? What a jerk!
$C: Death has that effect... Loosens the sphincter and the animal (humans included) defecate while keeling over. So the bird probably shat as a result of death. 
$C: My first instinct is to yell "WHO DID THIS TO YOU!?"
$C: Toby?
$C: Oh, Death Excrement! Ive heard of that
$C: r/untrustworthypoptarts /s
$C: My spirit animal.
$C: Bird knows pc is shit
$C: Meh, my day is going better than yesterday.
$C: My day has been shit
$C: Better than that bird's.
$C: F
$C: Better than the bird, that's for sure
$C: Lemme guess. Your parents walked in on you sitting in front of your laptop with no pants on, a dead bird and bird shit on your laptop, and you went with the old "I dunno what happened, he just flew in here" story?

"What the frick? I didn't order this!"
$C: A plague is upon your home. Move. 
$C: Call IT
$C: These new Twitter notifications are getting ridiculous.
$C: The Twitter took a shit and died.
$C: Look like he flew though your window into your Windows. 
$C: I was walking in from football practice the other day and some dumb shit bird flew as fast as it could into my window and dropped dead in front of my feet. Birds are dumbasses.
$C: This is what happens when your twitter DMs get deleted before they’re read.
$C: Better than the bird's
$C: Did you see it die or find it dead?  It might have flown into something then landed there.
$C: Lots of stuff shits itself, crashes and dies on Dell running Windows.
$C: Bird was killed by your Wi-Fi frequency. Very interesting. 
$C: Did it just knocked itself out? I have seen that numerous times happen with birds 
$C: Technically he flew into two Windows by the looks of it 
$C: Got to accidentally pass my ex with her BF on the way to my work event. Pretty dope. 
$C: Birb.exe dumped and killed
$C: At least u got free lunch
$C: I hope that's how I go out

$C: Did you try CPR man?
$C: One time a sick-but-dying bat woke me up by falling upon my pillow in front of my face. He didn't even have the fucking decency to die; *I had to "euthanize" him*.

&nbsp;

If he'd had an estate, I would have sued.
$C: Well it is a Dell so I get it.
$C: Clearly the bird saw you as a welcoming, warm, inclusive person; with whom it could spend its last moments with dignity. 
$C: Well the engine blew on my car today, I can't afford to replace it but I don't have a dead bird in my laptop.
$C: Looks like a budgie, are you Australian? Otherwise it must have been somebody's pet :(
$C: Gas leak in your house? Birds in the past were used to detect trace amounts of harmful chemicals in the air. If the canary died, you got out of the mine. 
$C: That’s full-on legit bird flu right there
$C: So essentially you murdered a bird who shit on your laptop
$C: At least you weren't mauled by a bear today
$C: TIL humans are not the only species that shit when they die
$C: I had one hit my windshield the other day. Not only did it hit my windshield, but it also managed to get stuck in the wiper blade. Not under it, but the framework of the wiper itself. A dead bird stuck in my wiper for an hour. Worst commute ever.
$C: Bird said your laptop so shitty it killed me!
$C: Im so sorry your laptop is also a Dell. :c
$C: My immediate response was "Jesus fucking Christ," and laughter. My first experience with bird death found me crawling on all fours to meet face-to-face with a dead Bluejay under my jewelry box (a separate body like a dresser). My sweet cat thought I needed it since I was pregnant...
$C: My day is going better than that birds, thats for damn sure. 
$C: Life has a weird way of saying fuck you
$C: r/natureismetal 
$C: r/notsopcmasterrace
$C: All of a sudden i feel better about working a double shift for the last 20 hours. 
$C: you should go play the lotto right now...you probably won't win...but hey...if you don't play, you'll never win...right? :)
$C: I agree, your life sucks. 
$C: Looks fake.
$C: /r/NeverTellMeTheOdds because I still wouldn’t believe you- but that is random af!
$C: This is definitely an interesting event 
$C: Better than yours.
$C: 146k votes for this poor bird dying? Smh.
Guess I saw this in a different light.
$C: Real talk I saw the picture and thought a bird landed on your computer. That shit is a work of art. 
$C: Wow.... That bird did not like your laptop! It popped with such anger it died! 
$C: How graceful.
$C: Pretty sure Chris Cornell wrote a song about this. "Like Suicide" by Soundgarden
$C: Better than that bird's... That's for sure.
$C: :(
$C: lol he doesn’t realized he’s been cursed
$C: Nice.
$C: Better than his..  damn, can you imagine busting into someone's place, shutting yourself and dying in one fell swoop.  That's a bad day.
$C: HAHAHA
$C: Call dell tech support
$C: Windows 10: "like what you see?"
$C: Not as good as that bird’s
$C: [Can confirm](https://media1.tenor.com/images/d06d6720bb5ae75e46647a8d0c8e265b/tenor.gif?itemid=5919210)
$C: I feel you.  Driving home from college on the interstate and there was a slight drizzle so I turned on my wipers.  At that same moment a bird barely made it over the van in front of me and was jerked down by the down draft and smashed into my windshield.  It got stuck in my wipers and started flapping like crazy as it barely cleaned the water off my windshield.  Back and forth it went as I screamed, it screamed.  Then it broke loose and went over the car to be crushed by the car behind me.  I still don't know what I was supposed to take away from that encounter.
$C: I’m 29 and I just got shingles. It sucks. 
$C: Did you shut your laptop on it and kill it?
$C: Just be glad cows don't fly.
$C: Thats a no from Disney then...
$C: Windows is always open, yet no fresh air
$C: That's, um...

Hi! 🙋‍♂️
$C: I mean... damn...
$C: Yeah, no
$C: r/WTF
$C: Laptop probably overheated.
$C: Well you're repping a Dell laptop, so I think my day is going better than yours 
$C: So judging by the model of the laptop and green ethernet cable, that is a DoD computer. Honestly I'm not even surprised that happened haha. Our stuff seems cursed at times. 
$C: It has begun - the end of the world!!
$C: At least he died with the pleasure of taking a good shit...
$C: i just spent a 9 hour work day doing detailed surveying of a swamp in 30 degree weather, 100% humidity and 100 mosquitoes per cubic foot. i’ve been better
$C: I blame the Dell.
$C: With that laptop I’d say he did you a favor.
$C: What was its airspeed velocity?
$C: It was trying to delete it's browser history before it croaked!
$C: “IVE COME FROM THE FUTURE TO WARN YO-“
$C: did you know when anything dies it looses bladder control LOL and piss shits 
$C: He’s not dead, she’s just really tired from pooping. He’ll be back up in just a few hours. 
$C: Well you're not even logged in yet so must be alright. 

Id have just went home.
$C: Kid threw 4 chairs and a desk at me...so I think I win
$C: Bummer, Dude. I think that was the Bluebird of Happiness.
$C: Not sure but this might be an official r/partyparrot at the end of its life.
$C: The bird needed 60 fps to go on living. Why didn't you get the Alienware why?!
$C: You are the chosen one. You will absorb the soul of this bird and in doing so, be granted it's powers.

Sadly it seems it's powers are shitting on laptops and then dying, so maybe save that as a special move.
$C: Better, now.
$C: Death is dark as fuck.
$C: Yo fam talking about dead stuff there's definitely something DEAAAD next to my apartment like legit I'm covering my nose while typing this I hope it's not a dead human cause I heard that dead human flesh is the nastiest....ah man this smell is strong 
$C: The thought of this poor birds last moments kind of makes me sad 😔 
$C: Ladies and gentlemen patient zero
$C: you have bird flu 
$C: Or did that little shit give you the bird? 
$C: Did you spill black ink on your desk too?
$C: Well, it’s a Dell, so maybe the bird did you a favor. 
$C: Oh... shit. 
$C: I'M NOT THE HARBINGER OF BIRD DEATH ANYMORE!!!

THE TITLE IS ALL YOURS!!!

IT COMES WITH NO BENEFITS!
$C: #skyking2
$C: Is it just me or for some reason the picture looks photoshopped? The light hits the bird in a very weird way
$C: Time; 5:35

Cause of Death; Unknown

Dun dun dun!
$C: Cartman was right 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Collect its bones
$C: “Excuse me if me dying inconvenience you” Bird
$C: It probably shat as it died, the relaxing of the sphincter muscles and all.
$C: Thanks to you, that bird didn’t die alone.
$C: r/untrustworthypoptarts 
$C: He missed your keyboard with his shit though, so there's that.
$C: Not too bad...but then again, I have screens on my windows.
$C: Get a good life insurance and leave your loved ones as main beneficiaries, just in case.
$C: The way the picture is angled makes it look like the bird got pancaked between your screen and keyboard. 
$C: I'd recommend bringing the bird corpse to a veterinary office or something, the lack of obvious external trauma to the bird indicates to me that it likely died from some form of disease which is potentially transmissible to humans. Cheers
$C: Blue Jay?
$C: Dude a bird just died falling out of the sky last week here, right next to me. Is there some bird sickness going around?
$C: Windows 10, thats why
$C: Clearly, you need to be thinking of the pranks you're going to be pulling with this thing.
$C: Its a dell, you didn't want it to die on something useful did you?
$C: Seems like a scene from the bird equivalent of pulp fiction. Instead of the horse it's the bird, instead of the bed the laptop.  You get the gist. 
$C: He's dead Jim
$C: Wanna know the content of the censored document. Is it a blueprint of a revolutionary bird trap?
$C: I was fired from my newly acquired county job today, after failing a drug test. It’s been over 45 days since smoking. My day sucked ass.
$C: did he die on your laptop or did you put him there for the photo 
$C: That’s how I want to go!!!
$C: Cool photoshop skills ;)
$C: It flew into your windows!? Sorry I'll leave...
$C: Fantastic, found out I pass d level 1 of the CFA, bosses told me to have the day off, golfed, got stoned, can't complain
$C: Now.. Fine I guess
$C: To be fair, you are using a Dell laptop. Maybe it's a sign!
$C: Um... my day's going well
$C: I’m the bird.
$C: A bird shitting on you is good luck. A bird dying near you is bad luck. They wash each other out and nothing will change. 
$C: At least he didn’t sh*t between the keys!
$C: Patient Zero !
$C: Crap. This is legendary. I logged in the first time when this had ~12k upvotes and now its at 160k. 
$C: "Decided"
$C: Almost 5k comments and no one has called this out as fake yet? Sheesh.
$C: Well ain’t that some shit... 
$C: Decided to die? You mean died after you decided to slam that laptop shut😂
$C: Well at least he died in a warm place 
$C: [Shitty too](https://imgur.com/MXjGX6O)
$C: Might want to check the battery in your carbon monoxide detector.
$C: Wow
$C: You are the chosen one.
$C: Today I was getting ready to dig up some weeds and found a black widow in the handle of my shovel.  I banged the shovel on the ground to dislodge the spider and a mostly eaten bloody bird carcass fell out of the tree above me and landed only a couple feet away.  Weird day, pictures were taken.
$C: *What a shitty day*
$C: Aww you scared the shit out of it and then the died 

/s
$C: Well this is something you don't see ev....er.
$C: Why the fuck did this make me laugh? 
$C: Well that sucks 
$C: 3 gold well deserved for the day you're having, my friend. I'd give you a gold, if I could.
$C: He didnt want to face the end alone.

$C: r/bestof
$C: Poor little guy probably just didn’t want to be alone in his final moments...
$C: Yea, ok, Norman Bates. We know what you’re going to do with that bird. 
$C: I'm gonna take a wild guess and say that the decision to die was out of the bird's hands*.     
    
* = Primary flight feathers
$C: I laughed so hard that i shit on my laptop and about to die.
$C: Did you give it CPR ?
$C: It call's Perry 
$C: Ewww...Windows.
$C: This is so fake 
$C: My day was better than his was, apparently. 😳😳 
$C: I think mafia sent you a message but sent you that instead of horses head in your bed....
$C: What a shitty laptop.
$C: Not so bad anymore 
$C: It means that anything is possible and that we should never take anything for granted.
$C: My day is better than the bird’s day. 
$C: I wonder that kind of story the little guy had
$C: I mean it could be worse, you could have fled into a strangers house, shat yourself and died right?
$C: You might want to get your laptop like scrubbed now!
$C: Dude, you're getting a turd.
$C: Better than the bird's I guess.
$C: Well ain't that just dandy LOL
$C: Holy shit I haven't laughed that hard in years 😂
$C: I swear to you Mrs. Poff it isn’t my fault that I wasn’t able to finish my report on time. You see there was this blue bird that hit my window and then pooped on my laptop just before it died on my keyboard and well I couldn’t.....
$C: Stupid Microsoft Windows.
$C: There's a South Park joke about pooping when you die in here somewhere.
$C: That bird knows how to treat a dell.
$C: These are actually north Korea's new weapon, they are supposed to delay technological advancements by shitting and dieing on everything 
$C: It shat on your windows 10
$C: Reminds me of my own and only trip to "the happiest place on earth."  When entering the gate a big pigeon shat on my son's head ruining his day (I took him to women's bathroom and cleaned up his hair while his Dad purchasing for him new clothing (Disney T shirt.) He'd been looking forward to the day and was upset as his older brother spent the morning laughing at him about it.   Can only wonder how many people get shit on upon entering the park!  
$C: Think grim reaper sent it telling you to run
$C: All right I'm pretty sure you're gonna get avian flu 
$C: I'd say you're having a pretty good day; at worst it what on your speaker, which is a lot better than shitting on your keyboard.
$C: Hello technical support?
$C: Talk about a shitty start
$C: Fatal Error: Angrybird.exe has stopped working. 
$C: r/2meirl4meirl
$C: Sad story time: I live in one of the driest captial cities in Australia. One winter a couple of years back we had a torrential downpour. It's usual to have flooding rains in winter, but not so much in my particular area. 

I saw a Greater Sulfur Crested Cookatoo in the backyard, on the ground, walking around and getting drenched. I have put wild bird seed out for the local birds before, and so a cockatoo on the ground during heavy rain is particularly unusual behaviour, as they are big birds and getting wet will make them a target for predators like cats and foxes.

I went out to check on it. Now the cockatoos here are social, but not tame, so if you get too close, they'll fly off. This one didn't. That's when knew something was very wrong. Close inspection, I could see his beak was broken and deformed and his head was missing a lot of feathers.

I put on some heavy gardening gloves and got a towel and a cardboard box, and picked him up. They do bite, so if you are ever forced to rescue a large parrot, you need some seriously heavy duty gloves or your fingers will take a beating. 

I drove him down to the vets, and unfortunately he had Beak and Feather which is highly contagious and at his stage, fatal for the bird. They had to put him down.

I named myself after his legacy. It's a sad thing to see the disease in action in the wild, especially knowing these birds are highly intelligent and can live for 40 years or more in the wild, up to 80 in captivity. Sadly, a life cut short by a wasting disease.

Make sure you throw that thing in the garbage.
$C: My day is going good thanks for asking!
$C: That bird was a radical Appleist
$C: Much of been shitting your self ;-)
$C: That's some bad joojoo
$C: This happened to me once! Came home from the gym, grabbed my rotisserie chicken out of the fridge and started going to town... Then looked over to this on the other counter:

$C: Dude, you’re getting a Dell...
$C: Dude! You got a Dell!
$C: That’s shitty
$C: you scared the shit outta that bird to death.

$C: Bird dies from running into Windows. Huh.
$C: This is exactly how I want to go out. 
$C: Hot
$C: Thus begins the next pandemic that will wipe out humanity, but save the world.  
$C: LMAO! YUP, EVEN STEVENS I SAY.
$C: Bird flu?
$C: I feel really badly for the bird, I feel really badly that you have to deal with that shit (and the body), but goddamn if this isn’t the funniest fucking thing I have seen all day so far.

The comments are also golden.
$C: My day was not good 😣
I was in the bad mood and still am
$C: Not as exciting as your day i guess. Lol

$C: Well as long as it shit on your laptop you will now have the luck to win all fortnite games
$C: Time of death.... 6:35
$C: Extremely  interested in what was scribbled out...at least make an attempt ti entertain us with lies
$C: Pandemic begins
$C: Traditionally, dead birds in your path mean big changes on the way soon. A death of an old thing (job, relationship, change of residence, maybe even a person), but ALSO the beginning of a new and different path. It symbolizes a big, uncomfortable transition. But one more than worth it. Clearly, the universe felt strongly that you needed to get this message directly. Be ready. But don't be afraid. Good things are in the other side. 
$C: These viral advertisements are getting elaborate. 
$C: It's aDell, so it's really more like a bird took a Dell on your Dell
$C: How the fuck has this managed to garner 168,000 upvotes. In 10 hours…?! That’s almost 5 a second - for a dead fucking bird! I mean, what the actual FUCK, people…?! 🤪🤦‍♀️
$C: Sorry that you had a bad day but I gotta ask what kind of dell is that? Ive been looking for a laptop with  keypad
$C: Macys? 
$C: It’s ok, bird death actually improves the performance of dell laptops. 
$C: Please tell me that you stated the "time of death" out loud after failed attempts of resuscitation. 
$C: But why is he upside down and what happened to his feet?

$C: it's a Dell --- just good to shit on and die
$C: I think that’s at least 5 years of bad sex
$C: I laughed way to hard at this... 
$C: I'll take your dead lap top shitting bird over some of my co-workers any time. The bird is quiet, its mess is easy to clean up, and it is guaranteed to never bother you again. None of these things is true of my coworkers.
$C: Good actually, my dog didn't try to piss on my face for once. 

$C: This is the type of shit you can’t make up
$C: Did you buy the bird from Lloyd Christmas?
$C: I’m shopping for a new laptop too. 
$C: Wow! That one is definitely more interesting than my day! Death, how inconvenient! Lol.
$C: "pretty bird, pretty biiiird, Polly wants a cracker?"   X_x
$C: You have quite the luck!
$C: Bad juju
$C: it was trying to catch the mouse
$C: Sounds like an omen bro idk!!
$C: I feel ya...
$C: On which day of Christmas was this? 
$C: It's your fault.
$C: You killed it, didn't you?..

$C: I’m ugly and I’m proud.

$C: The important question is - is the time 06:35 or 16:35?
$C: You have a killer laptop. 
$C: I'm slightly confused, did he flew in through Windows 10 or 7? Cause I thought we closed 7.
$C: Why are you keeping it warm on your Dell laptop?
$C: I think that's the little asshole I threw out on the side of the road a few weeks ago.  He flew straight for the sun and I didn't stick around to see where he came down
$C: Get out!
$C: That's a life well lived for that bird. He died the "fuck you I do what I want" way. 
$C: Am I the only one wondering which of the windows the bird hit?
$C: He knew the FBI was on that laptop monitoring you... he sacrificed his life for your privacy
$C: You sure that's the right order? 
$C: You even got the time of death and date 
$C: Like the Killer whale with her cub on the nose....it's a warning from nature.... we're killing it. 😉
$C: I jusat sapilled sa cup of coffee on my psantsa, desak sand keybosard. I samell of coffee sand my keybosard isan't working properly...

$C: Bird flu.
$C: Oh, ya know, just the same old thing.
$C: Just run it through the dishwasher!
$C: At least YOU had a better day than the bird. 
$C: Ewww! Be careful you dont want to get hystoplasmosis!!! The bird poop disease!!! Just an FYI: you dont have to eat bird poop to get hystoplasmosis. 
$C: Dude! You got a Dell!
$C: Well that's gotta suck
$C: Yeah right... It "decided to die"... Admit it, you made the decision!
$C: Probably god trying to remind you that it’s about time you get a new laptop.
$C: That's how I want to die, taking a shit while on my computer.
$C: Nice alibi. Liar.
$C: 😳
$C: Same story, only with a moose. 
$C: I can't top that
$C: A little better after hearing your story, thanks.
$C: I remember when a bird dropped dead infront of me. Although he couldn't fly so I caught him, took him somewhere to see if they could help, and when we put him on the ground he ran around in a circle and then dropped dead.
$C: What kind of bird is that? It's really pretty (aside from the losing control of his bowels and dying) 
$C: I lost my Bluetooth headphone ear buds just now
$C: This probably the best post on the entire internet.
$C: No no he’s not dead, he’s restin’! Remarkable bird, ain’t it?
$C:  )l
$C: "I'm taking you down with me"
$C: Looks like the bird got scared his s#!t out looking at your laptop screen and died.   
Was it your photo as screensaver or wallpaper?
$C: Get your affairs in order
$C: RIP lil birb
$C: So Cartman was right? 
$C: What's with the bit scribbled on the table in front of the computer?
$C: Did you kill a bird for up votes? You bitch!!! 
$C: Idk, why did you kill a bird then spread mayo on your laptop for imaginary internet points?
$C: RIP birbo
$C: There’s a city in Greece that has a “shit” ton of bird poop that it literally covers the city...

Permission to live there?
$C: Fuck you op.
$C: I actually laughed out loud on this one 😂
$C: Birdy birdy in the sky dropped some white wash in me eye aren't we glad that cows cant fly.
$C: Where are its legs...?
$C: Quoth the bluebird: "Nevermore, nevermore"
$C: I hope you were watching Black Hawk Down or Falling Skies
$C: how do you know this was its decision?
$C: Like seeing the rerun of...

$C: I have the same computer. I would love if a bird shit and dies on my computer Soni have an excuse to buy a new one.
$C: He shit himself to death
$C: At least it didn't shit on the power button, that's damn near impossible to clean without taking apart a lot of your laptop
$C: /r/wellthatsucks
$C: My day feel deja vu? 
$C: WTAF? What voodoo god did you piss off? 
$C: It’s sad how many birds die when they hit Windows.
$C: That's life, man.  Eat, shit and die.  
$C: return the favor. find an innocent bird's nest, with or without occupants, and shit in it 
$C: Fine, thanks for asking.

Edit: Fucking mobile.
$C: Tbf that laptop is a piece of shit anyway, I think the bird was just giving you a reason to upgrade
$C: The date in the laptop its my birthday... spooky!
$C: Oof
$C: That day? I was celebrating my country's independence day.
$C: Just bombed a midterm and discovered that my grade for another was shit. Heres a beer

You fucking bot! How can I show my Facebook friends reddit memes with context if you ignore me like my ex?! 
$C: Looks like we have the same laptop, which is probably what killed it
$C: u/titletoimagebot
$C: better than you, not by much, but better
$C: Lmao! I had a great laugh.. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: I laughed way too hard at this but my day was ok so far, poor bird though but wouldn’t have happened if you had a Mac.
$C: You don’t have to lie. We all know you were watching a bird movie and used that poor dead bird to crank one out. That’s not bird poop. That’s human seed. Now clean up your mess before the keys really get stuck together.
$C: well, it is a Dell....
$C: I hope you handled it carefully, birds can have terrible diseases and this one was likely very sick with some aviary ailment.  A shocker for sure and possibly an omen. I hope your days ahead are better! 
$C: I heard that's a problem with that brand of Dell
$C: Why are you posting your twitter issues on reddit instead of twitter? 
$C: Please tell me it did at least bring your Hogwarts letter!
$C: That's Dell for you.... nuff said 
$C: r/nevertellmetheodds
$C: @ OP: Former pest control guy here.

Spray your keyboard  and surrounding area with with a pesticide for fleas and mites. One that says "kills eggs when they hatch". Please, for your own sake. 

#You do not want bird mites in your house, I promise you.

Do this right away. You may already have a problem. Good luck.
$C: That's what you get for running Windows.
$C: "Decided" to die?
$C: My bad dude I accidently let that one get away must've died from the internal bleeding 
$C: No one else thinks it weird that the bird is lying on his keyboard, but the time is still up on his screen? So if the bird had hit a key, it would have switched to the log in screen right? And then the weight of the dead bird would be pressing a key so you would have constant input to the screen, why is this not showing? Also, that looks like butter, not bird poop. Either way, well done on the story.

EDIT: Spelling.
$C: No it didn't, your lying and that's fake shit 
$C: Told you everyone shits themselves when they die!
$C: Press F to pay respect 
$C: It took me forever to find this post after I heard rumors that this post was stolen by some buzzfeed like company, I needed to give you my up vote have a great year friend
$C: Not as bad as yours apparently
$C: This is so random it can't be true
$C: Can we make this the top Reddit post ever? 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Bird flew in my window and landed on my laptop so I smashed my laptop closed. I killed the bird but I also hit it so hard that a little shit flew out...
$C: This is fake and gay
$C: yes, I'll take "SHIT THAT NEVER FUCKING HAPPENED FOR $1000, ALEX"

gtfo
$C: thats my fucking bird

$C: Lie. You found a dead bird on the yard. Grabbed some of moisturizing cream and smeared on your laptop. Case Solved. 
$C: Hahahaha the last shit 
$C: Easily could’ve squirt some mayonnaise and set a dead bird on my laptop for the same amount of karma you’re getting buddy 😫
$C: Next time buy lenovo 
$C: Is this how we're electing popes now? I've never been super clear on the protocol. 
$C: Birdshit happens.
$C: Isn't Windows 8 the real shit on your laptop?
$C: u/JaMollyAdams apparently better than yours! 😂😂
$C: Sell it to a blind kid
$C: A dell laptop? I didn’t know they still existed lol
$C: Well it is a Dell....so it's just shit piled on existing shit. 
$C: WITNESS ME, BLOOD BAG!
$C: That looks like a domesticated parakeet so I don't think this was a wild bird and was probably someone's pet 😢
$C: It means: your laptop sleeps with the birds. 
$C: Fuck this guy in particular 
$C: fuck man that thing really wanted to tell you it's time for you to get your shit together huh. 
$C: looks like a decent breakfast, didnt have to get up, already warm, what are you complaining about
$C: All I can do is lmao right now.
$C: Inb4 die from flu
$C: Just DAMN!!!

$C: Now your computer has a virus.
$C: wtf 177000 upvotes
$C: I have always wondered where all the dead birds go. Now we know. 
$C: He probably just noticed it was a Dell. 
$C: I’m having a pretty decent day. Thank you for asking 🙂
$C: FUNERAL PYRE AT SEA

$C: Damn that’s sick.😂

$C: Looks like a juvenile California Scrub-Jay.

Where is your location and what time of day did this happen?
$C: August 14 2018 was a rough day for me to, take an upvote for your troubles
$C: Real talk. There's the slim possibility that bird had rabies. Maybe make sure you've got your shots. Make sure to tell them you had this unusual encounter with an animal so they know exactly what you need. 

I read a haunting story on reddit somewhere on what it's like to be claimed by rabies. You really don't want that. 
$C: wtf happen here
$C: So? Someone gave you the bird?! 
$C: The bird was the reincarnation of your great granpappay. He knew he was dying once again and his last wish was to try to deliver a message to you. To stop with the computer because you're wasting your life away on reddit
$C: r/mildlyinfuriating
$C: Oh like you were working anyway, the computer is in sleep mood Donna! 
$C: r/fiftyfifty
$C: Most intense upvoting I've ever seen. 
$C: This would never happen with ASUS ROG laptop. Bird would have hit the breaks to stop and watch you game. 
$C: Might want to consider taking the carcass to your health unit or animal control. Kind of weird circumstances for its death
$C: I don't know why, but this just really cheered me up.
$C: I think you should lick it clean with your tongue.  let us know how that works for you.  Thanks for the post.
$C: Not this interesting 
$C: You got Trump's new tweet! 
$C: That's what you get for owning a Dell.
$C: Some animals will seek out humans when they are in trouble. This bird may have panicked and found you if only just to keep him company while he died. The poop, he just couldn't control. Poor little guy. 
$C: Your Dell is shitty.
$C: And you have Windows 10. Another strike.
$C: Can 😙😂😉😁
$C: /r/madlads 
$C: All about you huh. 
$C: Barry the bird and the laptop together
$C: Don't lick it...

$C: Now THIS is the quality content I subscribed for.
$C: Past case of avian flew.
$C: Told an old crush I thought they were cute via one of those Instagram “send x if you don’t hate me and I’ll post my favorite picture from your account but you have to answer some questions first” things, and one of those questions was “what’s one thing you’ve always wanted to say to me” so I just said “I think you’re cute” and they posted my picture, left me on read, and didn’t send x when I posted it on my story so I honestly don’t know?
$C: I mean, I just spent the second straight day jackhammering in an empty swimming pool in 95+ degree heat so...yeah, I'll take your shitting, dead bird if you wanna trade?
$C: I've been unemployed for over a month due to my mental health and I'm trying not to fail my class so, probably better than the bird...
$C: I saw someone today whose shopping bags (yeah, plural) split in half. Eggs, tomato sauce and a range of other things all over the pavement. 

Turned the corner, someone crashed into her parked car. The wheels were pointing outwards. 
$C: Zaza n b.c bbn b
$C: Guys help seriously I have a problem. Everyone keeps telling me they will die from ligma and I’m very worried. I don’t what this disease is but it seems to be pretty bad. If anyone could explain to me what ligma is I would appreciate it very much because google has no info on this disease.  Please guys tell me what ligma is.
$C: This should totally be in r/funny because this is gold 🤣
$C: This is so sad Alexa play darude sandstorm 
$C: It’s a dell , no big deal.
$C: As an enlightened vegan, the fact that you took the picture for karma instead of quietly burying that poor creature makes me incredibly sad.  what is happening in this world?  what if a person flew in and died on your computer?  would you post it to redit?  food for thought.  I wouldve made sure to give that unfortunate creature a proper bariul, just sayin
$C: Omg! Wth? That is funny, but not funny at the same time. Creepy that it happened the way it did. Be glad the pop didn't land on the keys or it would have been really hard to clean. Disinfect that keyboard!!!
$C: Perfectly balanced. 
$C: People only say its good luck to make you feel better about having just been shat on from a great height by the bird.
$C: *Seinfeld music plays
$C: That bird knew it was going to die and didn’t want to give you bad luck, so it shit right before it died. That birds a fuckin hero.
$C: So his laptop is in for good luck, but OP is not.... 
$C: He's Shia LaBoeuf?

Man, his day just keeps getting worse...
$C: True story: When I was about 21 I was walking across a bowls green with some friends in Port Sunlight. In the middle there was a bunch of flowers on the ground. I picked them up and began to read out the card which started "In loving memory of" but then, in realising my error, put them back on the ground. My friend started laughing at me saying "you're cursed! you're cursed now!" Within 10 seconds a bird shat on me. I'm not sure about this whole 'good luck' thing.
$C: A seagull shit in my grandfathers mouth when I was young. Is that good or bad luck? 
$C: A bird shit in my eye in boot camp, massive pink eye. I wasnt allowed to go in the pool for swim qual, so i lost my future job. Maybe it was a blessing in disguise. 


It wasnt. They sent me to field artillery. 
$C: R/unexpectedshialeboeuf
$C: It kinda looks like when it shit on his laptop he crushed it 
$C: The bird felt bad it was gonna give him bad luck so he shit before he died. XD
$C: [Guess I'm lucky then.](https://i.imgur.com/PEccKnb_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium) Mine made it out alive
$C: Whoever made up that it’s good luck to get shit on by a bird definitely got shit on by a bird in front of people they knew. Guaranteed.
$C: Then I have a damn lucky car....
$C: Yes! First time I’ve heard someone other than my mother say this.. A pigeon pooped on my head when I was in the 1st grade. I thought she made this up lol.
$C: Jerry r/Seinfeld is Even Stevens. 
$C: *Be one with harmony*
$C: What do they say about it dying on your laptop?
$C: My name is steven
$C: Double jeopardy, you’re fine. 
$C: I don't think he feels even stevens however
$C: God be praised!
$C: They say its good luck if he dies in your laptop so you are good ! 😁
$C: Wouldn't this be the expected value anyway?
$C: No one i have ever met said its good luck to get shit on, i think they told you that so you would pull through hard times 
$C: It’s even Stevens for the laptop, OP tho..... 
$C: I get shat on by birds regularly, I hate them for that reason (I'm also a hygiene nut) and I'm also very scared of them... everytime this shit (pun not intended) happens someone says it's good luck. I am the most unlucky person ever lol
$C: I was once shit on by birds **THREE** times in one month. I have yet to experience any kind of luck from it.
$C: Fuck this particular bird right here 
$C: At least he has the window open with those computer fans running..
$C: r/waterpancakes
$C: Neglecting, of course, that you’re covered in shit and have a dead bird. Barring future events, I count that as unlucky.
$C: Even Stevens. Hell of a show.
$C: photos or it never happened. Photoshop doesn't count.😎
$C: Its double jeopardy!
$C: This thread is beautiful 
$C: If the foo shits...
$C: Yep...they right!

$C: Except now he's stuck with a dead bird and a shit covered laptop
$C: Hello, my name is Steven. You called?
$C: Better than the the bird’s
$C: Still bad luck for him good luck for the computer 
$C: Wait are you being serious? Or just sarcasm please I need to know!
$C: Not a believer in omens, but be careful. 
$C: Bird pooped on my head once during a first date. Now we’re engaged
$C: The laptop is lucky. The owner is fucked.
$C: beans
$C: Yeah I've been pooped on twice in my life by birds. People say how it's good luck, well I certainly didn't feel very friggin' lucky!
$C: r/oddlysatisfying ?
$C: You are sooo FUNNY 💕‼️
$C: Idk if that's true because I've been shit on by a bird 3 times in my life and my lifes still shit.
$C: Jim Lahey would call this a good omen. "Shithawks, Bubbles they're all around!"
$C: ashley young had a bird shat in his mouth and he transformed into a completely new player. so the first part is definitely true.
$C: Perfectly balanced.
$C: Yes...

Now OP has to start wearing shades of green, purple and black.

No exceptions, the Mouse has spoken

Edit: also red, cause jafar has to screw everything up, just like in the movie.
$C: I think this makes him patient zero. 
$C: Better then the birds I would say 
$C: Or a witch. 
$C: BE PREPARED. Is whats scrawled down in his ledger below
$C: Count Dookie
$C: This is the beginning of a Shrek live action movie
$C: I once had a blue songbird (not sure if it was technically a bluebird) fly into my house and literally land on my shoulder while I was deep into work at my computer.

It was not a zip-e-dee-doo-dah moment for either of us, but I didn't kill it.
$C: Or an undead Disney princess.
$C: If it does, let's hope this posted picture of the future story board doesn't destroy OP's career. 
$C: I don't get it, can someone explain?
$C: "Eat shit and die"
$C: I personally prefer to use the good ole' pigeon. Larger fecal mass.
$C: This message will self destruct in 5 seconds.
$C: I think the birds day was pretty bad...
$C: > I see you got my message.

You`ve won reddit. Go home. To your birds of shitty doom.

Edit: I am dying. Can not breathe. If I succumb to situational humor, so be it. Non, je ne regrette rien. Let it be written on my grave stone: *"I see you got my message."*
$C: You get that thing I sentcha?
$C: Subtle. I like it
$C: Can I get a message next, puhleeaaazzzze?
$C: Chanting Incantations!!! 🕺💃🏃👯
$C: I read your username as "ShitofDoom" at first, and was like.... "ah, yes, he got your message alright."
$C: Fuck.. Well done new celebrity.

$C: Is your name an SCP reference?
$C: Don’t shoot the messenger?
$C: Get shit on
$C: How about that delivery confirmation?

$C: Shit and die 
$C: Send a raven.

$C: It is official. You are pure evil. 

All I can think of is, the Godfather movie when Michael received the two dead fishes wrapped in brown paper.  So, yes someone is sleeping ~~fishes~~ birds.  Now, we need to find out what who and the meaning of the 'dead bird'.   Your day is not over yet.  
$C: for some reason I can't guild people on the credit card I have, but god it means a lot to me that you know I tried.
$C: Devious sloths 
$C: Thunderbird strikes again 
$C: Good thing it's not Sunday or your post may not have arrived in time for death. No post on Sundays.
$C: Whoa. Why do I feel like you might be, like, my evil nemesis or something.
$C: Bird, not sloth. That would have been way more traumatic. 
$C: I literally LOLed.  Outstanding postmanship, SlothOfDoom.
$C: Sampson?
$C: I challenge your Sloth with my Shroom, prepare for battle!

$C: Now that's the glass half full response 
$C: There are days where taking a dump on someone's laptop then dropping dead actually sounds pretty nice. 
$C: My thoughts exactly. The bird is clearly having the worst day of their life, whereas OP seems to be doing pretty well in comparison.
$C: I guess that depends on your idea of a “good day.”
$C: Probably, or probably this is how the zombie apocalypse begins, and OP is the patient zero.
$C: Well the bird is having a much better day than me 
$C: That's not true at all! The bird got a chance to die!
$C: Or the laptop.
$C: Nah. The bird isn’t using Windows 10.
$C: Maybe we should ask the bird what they think... oh wait.
$C: That's what I came here to say
$C: Idk, the bird doesn't have to worry about shit anymore
$C: the bird just solved all of it's worldly problems. the guy still has to clean shit up off his laptop.
$C: That’s Chang from Hangover’s response, “But did you fucking die!?”
$C: Idk I wish I was that bird
$C: Until he’s patient zero with a new strain of avian Flu. 
$C: Bird had a heart attack when it saw the really screwed up porn he was watching. 
$C: Slightly
$C: Is he really dead? Are you sure he’s not just stunned? 
$C: Came here to say this, take your upvote
$C: Sometimes you’re the one taking the shit, sometimes you’re the one getting shit on.
$C: I’d have to hear where he shit today, first. Before agreeing with you
$C: Hehehe. He ain't going home to his wife and kids. 
$C: Not if he's constipated
$C: At least the bird gave a shit.
$C: Id also choose this guy's dead bird
$C: I get it, cause it’s fuckin dead
$C: Until you contract the bird flu that killed it 
$C: Did someone shit on the bird's computer?
$C: That bird's day was really shitty 
$C: That bird went out like a warrior. The perfect crime.
$C: Debatable.

$C: Haha! Bravo.
$C: It's not dead, it's pining for the fjords 
$C: It's not dead! It's just resting! 
$C: Pretty sure that's a crow...
$C: It is a pretty bird. Very nice colors.
$C: Just pining for the fjords.
$C: The plumage don’t enter into it. It’s stone dead.

$C: Introducing "Shitter"
$C: Shitter* notifications
$C: Yeah that’s pretty much what opening guide feels like. 
$C: Haha good one.
$C: This comment made my day. Thanks bro
$C: Liberals decided using a tool created by a White man could be no more. So, they created tweetr and used birds thinking it was safer for the environment. Not realizing that like the windmills. fast moving things kill birds. :D
$C: this picture is an accurate summary of how I slide into the DMs
$C: Shitter
$C: Well shit, the new Facebook notifications are gonna terrify us all.

\*EDIT:cloacae->cloaca. incorrect pluralization assuming some sort of multi-chambered chimeric avian monstrosity. My mistake.
$C: Should be top comment
$C: "The bird's got balls!"
$C: > I mean there’s days I wanna shit on my keyboard and die. This bird had the ~~balls~~ shit to do it.

FTFY
$C: me too, constipation is the only thing stopping me from death
$C: Hahaha
$C: Why did he do it on OP's keyboard then? What a selfish bastard. 
$C: Holy shit. Somehow I read "fish" and nothing made sense.
$C: This [work of art](https://images.curiator.com/images/t_x/art/20f8d7e891435d17267817f3eb9e2212/bruce-nauman-one-hundred-live-and-die-1984.jpg) was made for you then (top left corner).
$C: Do birds have balls?
$C: This one is at least gold level 
$C: And now he has a cool story to tell. 
$C: The hardest decisions require the strongest wills.
$C: 😂🤣😂
$C: If you shit a die, than i can only assume you rolled a natural 1. On secons thought, perhaps it was the number 2.
$C: Agreed. It's probably sick. Don't touch it
$C: "Hello, this Animal Control.  How can I help you today?"

"A bird just flew in my window, pooped on my laptop and then died.  I think you guys need to come test it."

"Yeah...  Ok...  Yeah...  We'll get right on that...  Thanks for calling."




$C: That neon yellow shit is a big red flag. I've never seen bird shit like that.
$C: In America you call Vector Control, not Animal Control. 

Source; work for wildlife rescue. People bring us shit we can't take and I have to explain what goes where.
$C: Where at? I had a rash of dead birds in my backyard over a period of like 2 months a while back, and got concerned/annoyed so I called animal control and they basically said, “meh!” 
$C: I was just thinking what it could have been sick with that it had diarrhea and then keeled over immediately. Has a human ever died like that? What was that cause?  
$C: Also call the police. There is a chance this bird's death will be pinned on you and you don't want to go down for that. Trust me, I'm well-versed in bird law.
$C: Probably too late, op probably picked it up and tossed it outside. Rip op
$C: It most likely injured itself badly on the way in, broken neck, etc. No need to raise any alarm.
$C: Don’t a lot of birds die of fatigue? I know that flying takes lots of energy.
$C: It most likely hit glass.
$C: Probably run a virus scan, too.
$C: 6hrs, no update from OP. This is how our new zombie apocalypse begins
$C: 'I'm gonna trust this human to save my specie from this terribird disease.'
$C: I agree... Could be West Nile or something. Very abnormal... 

Poor birdie. I hope your day gets better, OP.
$C: Upvoted for visibility.
$C: Well, it likely died from internal injuries from hitting the window.
$C: ~~It looks like a parakeet/budgie to me. Looks like someone got tired of their pet and decided to set it 'free' without realizing it had almost no chance of survival.~~

Edit: I was wrong.
$C: Probably should burn that laptop too.
$C: Or eat it, if you want superpowers!!
$C: Beware of mites, man. Those things are not fun.
$C: Looks like a budgie to me. Lost house pet that couldn’t survive in the wild probably. 
$C: That’s really good advice. 
$C: Well, given that the bird just flew through his window, I think It might have died because of other causes then a disease...
$C: You can't get diseases from a bird!
$C: Please listen to this guy^^
$C: This. Or it might just be dumb and not understand glass since it’s still a juvie. Birds...can be real dumb
$C: YOU CAN’T GET DISEASES FROM A BIRD!
$C: Nah just fry it up, save me some beak!
$C: It hit the window.  It probably died from the impact. 
$C: I'll go get my coat hanger.
$C: *hereditary tongue click*
$C: A [sign of death](https://youtu.be/Ps6BfaD7J-o)
$C: The only bad omen that's bringing is a bad case of H5N1
$C: Either even birds want to see your new app, or you should really stop looking at that feather porn.
$C: No, it’s a Dell
$C: Arrrr... tis an ill omen. "White keyboard at morning, typos be forming. White keyboard at night, yer paper be tight."
$C: I remember once my mom was driving to work and me to school and accidently ran over a couple of birds. She mentioned that we should turn around and go home since that's probably a bad sign.


We didn't. And her wheel fell off her car later that day. Dead bird = go home. 
$C: It is known 
$C: you know the old saying of the bird that dies and shits on your laptop dont you?
$C: Yeah. Pretty sure OP's gonna die.
$C: ITS AN OMENENENENENEN....DoOoO DeE DEE DOo DeE DU dUrh. Duh Doo do Duh Dee doO 
$C: 7 DAYS!!
$C: I need a young priest and an old priest. 
$C: Man I miss Pratchett
$C: There’s some bad juju mcgumbo getting ready to go down. At least the bird tried warning them. 
$C: Now the writing's on a wall. It won't go away.
$C: But isn’t this a dell?
$C: I'm not a soothsayer or anything, but agreed.
$C: But it's a DELL laptop... 
$C: Or as I like to call it, dinner
$C: Just an omen pigeon.
$C: But it comes with a free frozen yoghurt, which I like to call frogurt!
$C: So like, oh man... Instead of oh man!!
$C: But a bird pooping on you is good luck. Maybe the one cancels the other out? 
$C: Ah yes, I remember the last time a bird flew through the window, shit on my laptop, and died on the keyboard. That was a rough week for me.
$C: Dinner!
$C: I think u meant to say o men that's bad
$C: Depends.

You have to open it to make sure.
$C: Dude, you’re getting a spell! 
$C: Nah, OP's just a reverse Disney Princess. Like an evil Disney Witch of some kind where everything around her withers and dies.
$C: Literally bad auspices.
$C: It's a Dell
$C: In my culture, that means someone close to you is going to die soon. I don't believe it but they do.
$C: Actually it’s a dell, HP makes the Omen 
$C: That's a Brad O'Man
$C: A bad case of the augury I take it.
$C: Seriously OP’s cursed now. 
$C: "A cormorant? What an auspicious sign..."
$C: I dunno where op is from, but to my people this means a bad harvest. Renew! 
$C: OPs going to be patient 0 of the new super mega bird flu. 
$C: Hey OP, let us know when you make it home safely
$C: Bad ramen
$C: An omen pigeon?
$C: Let us know if you die from this. 
$C: Stagnating air is common foreshadowing that something terrible is about to happen.
$C: Yep. 
Once I found a beautiful butterfly in my garden, just chilling on a plant. Watched it for ages, took photos. The next day I see it again, dead, in a spider web. It gave me this weird heavy feeling that stuck with me. 
A couple of months later I had the most lovely person move into one of the rooms in my house. We got along really well. And he died in a car accident after just a few weeks. 
It really made me wonder about omens. 
I feel like the bird shitting on the keyboard then dying... maybe delete twitter if you have it. Or stop posting stuff on social media. Just a thought. 
$C: ...for the bird. 
$C: Comet Sighted!
$C: BAD JU JU
$C: Should have bought a Mac...

Edit: and downvotes completely miss reference to standard Mac-head response to PC problems in the past
$C: Be sure to be polite and wavy back. 
$C: Could also be trichomonosis from a dirty bird feeder. 
$C: County health department confirmed wavy 


🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
$C: Interesting fact: West Nile virus is named because the Egyptians considered the west of the Nile as where the dead go (because the sun disappeared in the west and reborn in the east).  People were buried in the west with their heads facing to the west.

Mildly Interesting Fact: The Dead Sea is west of the Nile.  Coincidence? I think not.

Interesting fact: East Nile virus makes you live longer and improves your sex drive.  If you have an erection that lasts for more than 40 years, please consider getting the vaccine.

Mildly Interesting Fact: Egypt had a zombie problem for a while before they discovered that burying people to the east of the Nile just caused them to be reborn as walking corpses.

Interesting Fact: The dead were wrapped (Mummies) to prevent them from running after people in the event that another zombie problem occurred.

Mildly Interesting Fact: 5 of 7 of these facts are false.

Interesting Fact: The east is not "west of the Nile if you keep traveling west" because the Earth is flat.  If you keep going west, you just end up at a giant ice wall.
$C: 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
$C: Apparently it’s spreading like crazy so might not be a bad idea
$C: I wish I had a picture of it, but I used to have a funny fridge magnet that said "Got dead bird?" and gave you the number to call.  It had a cartoon of a dead [I'iwi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BBI%CA%BBiwi) on it.  This was Hawai'i so they were mostly looking for avian malaria and avipox virus which absolutely shred native birds.  Luckily we don't have West Nile... yet.
$C: WNV is carried in birds, but only kills corvids. This doesn’t look like a corvid.
$C: Odds are it just dead from heat stroke. 
$C: Boy, wouldn't that be the kicker if this thing was diseased and managed to infect OP with its dookie?
$C: But what if they want to collect OP to see if he's also now carrying West Nile?
$C: This should be top comment, very serious shit going down in subby's life right now. 
$C: That's what I was coming here to say. Thats off for sure, little guy may of had West Nile. If you're in California it's going around with the birds right now. 
$C: The *waves* is back!
$C: My guess is it hit the window before flying in, shit, and died of head trauma
$C: That's so silly, how could the bird carry an entire river
$C: But how can this small bird be carrying a whole nile?
$C: /u/JaMollyAdams I really hope you see this top comment. Super important.
$C: Is West Nile one of Kanye’s kids?
$C: 🌊🌊🌊
$C: I appreciate your comment - but I was laughing and enjoying the other comments until I ran into your "Debbie Downer" comment... I am not saying anything I'm just saying ......
$C: Make sure to write 'Dead Dove Do Not Eat!' on the bag though.
$C: Find the cure for r/deadbirds
$C: Lol hes fine.  A couple disinfecting wipes and the bird in the outside trash.  

You guys watch waayyyyyy too much tv.
$C: Just burn the thing. Much more sanitary. 
$C: I mean you do you and all but that shit crazy
$C: But who's gonna break into his house to find the dead bird in the freezer ala Dr. House?
$C: This guy House MDs.
$C: What about the laptop? Bag that and put it in the freezer too?
$C: Better throw out the laptop too...you know, because it's a Dell.
$C: And maybe put up a fucking screen on your windows
$C: Birds aren't as dirty as people think
$C: He's probably just pining for the fjords.
$C: Pining for the fjords. 
$C: The plumage don't enter into it. It's stone dead. 
$C: So, my cat once snatched a bird out of midair from our balcony and brought it in. I got her to put it down and it layed there, unmoving. While in trying to figure out if it is dead or if it's too injured and I need to put it out if it's misery, it pops up and flies off. 
$C: Oh man, that’s not good
$C: This is 7 omens at once. 

I know once my grandmother had a bird fly into her house and she saw it as a bad omen. The next day her neighbor - who she is very close with -got hit by a car and died.

birds, man
$C: Quit your job. Leave your house. Get a new identity. 
$C: Once i had a therapist appt where my therapist called me “little bird” in reference to a children’s poem I wrote. When I walked out of his office that same day, a bird fucking fell and died right at my feet. I about shat myself 
$C: Does he need to eat the birds heart to break it?
$C: No, it's Windows 10, pretty shitty.
$C: It definitely bodes
$C: Yeah yeah, now you have to pickle the beast to get the ball back.
$C: Yeah, this is not the Bluebird of Happiness I was expecting.
$C: Nah man, it's a Dell Latitude. 
$C: "We at Hogwarts had to make cutbacks and couldn't afford owls anymore, but congratulations,  you're in!"
$C: "That's rough buddy."
$C: Yep, Tuesdays.
$C: He prob had the bird flu, should check your windows for viruses
$C: Your're right - this wouldn't be a problem with a linux
$C: Just to shit on windows 
$C: Yup. Dead alright. 
$C: Yup. That's a bird. Oh what kind? A dead bird. Pack it up boys.
$C: I know an old Dell computer can be a beast of a burden sometimes, but I don't think you need to go that far.
$C: That's Tax Office's job to inspect animal control, not OP's.
$C: It's okay, they probably read Reddit
$C: "Oh yo, yeah, we found this bird ouside, we tried to turn it into a work whistle like in the beginning of the Flintones \*tug tug\*. tougher than it looked though." 
$C: OUR PETS HEADS ARE FALLIN' OFF. 
$C: Wait, why?
$C: Could just be a case of bad breath. 
$C: Too late, OP is dead.  Turned out he had a shit ton of radon in his house.
$C: The bird wouldn't have died instantly upon entering the room lmao....
$C: I'd check the dihydrogen monoxide levels aswell.
$C: It most likely had a heart attack
$C: It's always carbon monoxide with Reddit 
$C: Doesn't look like a Canary 
$C: Canary in a coal mine.
$C: To the top with you!  Keep OP alive!
$C: Yes all this might just be a hallucination. Except I can see the bird too, maybe we all have CO poisoning....
$C: The CO would have to be fatally high to instantly kill a bird the moment it enters your room (CO is dangerous because it slowly builds up in the body without you being able to tell). This bird obviously died from trauma and shock.
$C: > I would check your house for carbon monoxide levels.

Screw it, too dizzy to do all that.
$C: Did the bird leave any post it notes?
$C: Bird flew in from outside so the CO levels in OPs room should really be a factor in this.
$C: But what about my carbon dioxide detector? It goes off every time I am near it. Can you help me? 
$C: Yeah that's just a picture of a laptop, OP. 
$C: If he's sitting next to a window its not carbon monoxide levels.
$C: Reminds me of House

$C: Best reference yet. 
$C: I would check for M.Night Shamalan writing another horrible movie.
$C: If the bird flew in an open window, wouldn’t that air out any danger of excess co2?
$C: Ah, the canary in the mine analogy.

Reminds me of the joke from Hannah Gadsby about straight-white-males:

“They’re like the canaries in the mine, aren’t they? 
If they’re having a tough time, the rest of us are goners.”
$C: Not a canary. OP is fine.
$C: Oh Reddit here we go again
$C: If he rents and is in the United States his landlord is required to have a carbon monoxide alarm installed. 
$C: Been studying flock deaths for a while. Developed a theory that some of them are caused by release of methane (man-made or natural). Methane reaches a certain height in the air, then hovers and creates sort of a 'blanket' that lasts until it disperses. The height is dependent on things like barometric pressure, temperature, etc. 

I thought about this when reading about a flock of birds that dropped dead near a sewage treatment plant and a witness said "It looked like they hit an invisible wall in mid-air then dropped dead. The ones that weren't dead on hitting the ground were gasping for air." Further investigation showed the birds weren't poisoned nor ill but seemed to have died from sudden oxygen depletion.
$C: Seems like a lack in coverage if they can't prevent H1N1. 
$C: I typed your symptoms into the thing up here and it says you could have network connectivity problems.
$C: Where’s your gold? 
$C: I keep seeing these west Nile comments and imagining OP quietly panicking because s/he already picked it up with bare hands and then had a snack.
$C: Please do not eat that bird for lunch. Plucking those suckers is excruciating. 
$C: Well he can't just leave a dead bird on top of his laptop forever!
$C: A Dreamworks crone
$C: Pepe le Pew?
$C: ^*Well....*

*^Maybe ^gently ^place ^it ^in ^a ^shoebox.*
$C: > throw it in a shoebox

:) I have just the shoebox for it :)
$C: Just makes sure it's not the cumbox.
$C: I don't think it hit the window I think it flew in an open window hence: flew in my window
$C: Thats a weird gift to send someone 
$C: He's pinin' for the fjords. 
$C: Did he make it?
$C: Noice 👍
$C: [deleted]
$C: Unlike the bird. 
$C: Jesus, leave some pussy for the rest of us dude.
$C: Dad, get off Reddit!
$C: Sent from my Windows Phone, official phone of bird heaven
$C: That bird just gave a shitty review to it
$C: Windows update... NO!... death.
$C: What's wrong with Adele? I love her.
$C: that bird was really rolling in the deep. 
$C: Dude don’t shit on his dell. (We can’t all afford a Mac)
$C: That's the real tragedy. 
$C: I suspect owl flair.
$C: r/ilikthebred
$C: Last item on my bucket list too.
$C: That’s how I want to go
$C: Right? Suddenly my day doesn’t look so bad 
$C: He was just one day from retirement too.
$C: I think it's fair to say the bird had the worst hand out of everyone. 
$C: Wait what? This has to be a joke right? That’s some vindictive ass shit right there.  

You wanna break up? Well guess what I’m taking something that you won’t notice is missing till your crowning and go into the bathroom to take that massive shit. 
$C: Meta
$C: That would be a romantic as fu** first date.
$C: Bird poop, or tartar sauce? Only one way to find out.
$C: Maybe someone fed this bird laxatives and he died. 
$C: What the hell is this? You some kind of bird Detective?
$C: It was just starting up, it wouldn’t have had time to heat up. I’m 99.99% sure this whole thing was faked.
$C: turn around, bend over. I'll show you where my foo shits.
$C: underrated comment of the thread right here.
$C: Ever go drinking with one?  You always end up at the same place.  I tell you hwat, that Foo Bar is pretty damned fucked up.  Can't even recognized it as a bar any more.
$C: Have you seen this....Uncle Remus?
$C: Came to find Bluebird of Happiness reference. Upvote sent.
$C: F
$C: If the carbon monoxide level in his house is enough to instantly kill a bird that entered through his window, then I think the OP must have died within a couple of minutes of posting this.
$C: Or depression!
$C: Confirmed, could be West Nile or other mosquito-born virus.  But is't not like anyone is going to get bird blood mixed with theirs.

$C: F
$C: f
$C: F
$C: What a story this should be its own post. I'd be so annoyed coming home on the subway and being delayed like this , I was supposed to go take the A/C today glad I didn't go. 
$C: It’s pining for the fjords

$C: Me too, thanks?
$C: damn bro, are you ok?

$C: 😂😂😂😂 told ya e7mede rbk 
$C: If it was a pigeon, they almost always have mangled feet. 
$C: D2 🤙🏻
$C: Savage. 
$C: Meh it's just a dead bird, not like it's a dead animal or something.
$C: Are you suggesting that if your boss walked by and saw this picture you would get in trouble?

I see 3-4 dead animals (deer, raccoons, squirrels, possums, etc) during a 15 mile rural commute. Dozens of school busses follow this same route.

If you get offended by a dead bird, planet may not be for you.
$C: Pretty bird. Pretty bird
$C: Pretty sure none of that was real.
$C: You better watch out
$C: Lol
$C: Thanks for all the bread
$C: *ba dum tss*
$C: Obviously the bird had just had a similar experience, but without your fortitude .
$C: I'm in for 10 upbirds
$C: Which one is #1?

That Latitude is a durable workhorse.

$C: To be fair I think most things that kill birds don't kill people.

I'd definitely clean it up though! With fire probably...
$C: You need to get the milk out of the seat.

Seriously.

Aged milk smells worse than sick
$C: That's quite an assumption.

I'd say poison personally but could be shock. Especially if OP was there staring at it.
$C: Uh...where do you live, so I can avoid it?
$C: At this point, 100%

**NEW** custom title! usage: /u/titletoimagebot "your title here"
$C: looks like a juvenile mountain bluebird! (or maybe a western bluebird, but it doesn't have the rusty color)
$C: No offence but that's libtarded
$C: Hit window hard, gets concussion, shits, dies. 
$C: F

$C: You dont work in an office do you?
$C: The inspiron gaming laptop is actually surprisingly great. Mine has an issue when it goes to sleep mode, but thats from my stupidity. 
$C: Weird lad
$C: You're fake and gay lol wtf
$C: r/nothingeverhappens
$C: 90% of posts on here are pictures that would be meaningless without an overly descriptive title that a toddler could have made up. 

Like, LOL a bird just shit on my laptop and died right here LOL you'll never believe it!!!!!!!
$C: > I found the species of bird in this picture looked up a picture of that species and made a post about it to make it look like my bird karma plx xD

FTFY
$C: That... that very clearly is not your bird 
$C: I had a Lenovo for a year the week after the warranty was up the hard drive died
$C: we did it reddit, we once again brought evil orang cheeto man into something completely unrelated
$C: Not nearly enough shit for that. 
$C: That’s...not true
$C: Why can’t you just laugh at his funny moment? Why when I sort from controversial I see such terrible terrible terrible comments like this? 
$C: ligma balls
$C: Birds =/= People

Theres some god damn enlightenment for you
$C: > what if a person flew in and died on your computer? 

Well first off, I would be impressed as hell to see a human fly, and then end up very sad that said flying human is now dead. 

> would you post it to redit?

Fuck no, it’s a *person* not a bird. I would call the cops and administer CPR.




$C: Vegans always gotta let others know
$C: Also as a vegan, I really don’t think this is a big deal. OP was simply sharing something very strange that happened to them.  Sometimes we really have to pick our battles, and I don’t think this one in particular is worth fighting. The bird is already dead, OP didn’t kill it.  I understand what you’re trying to say but there’s not much here to call boo about

Edit: also burials are a human construct, animals couldn’t give two shits about it. OP should honestly either call animal control to take it since it’s sick, or throw it on the ground outside
$C: This literally makes no sense whatsoever. You think a bird matters as much as a human? 
$C: Vegans are falsely moral. Way more immoral when get down to the meat of it. Lol

$C: Worst, last, are they really equal? I mean, I wont remember my last day. 
$C: Also, that bird will never have a day like this again. So, there's that.
$C: Looks like the worst half-day at most. 
$C: Why do you have to sully the memory of our dearly departed bird friend by trying to start a political argument?  Just sad, man. 
$C: Came to the comments for bird identification. Thank you. 
$C: Can they be found in the UK? I think OP is from UK. 
$C: Can you rule out juvenile Indigo Bunting?
$C: Yes!
$C: Thanks, I *was* curious! 
$C: Looks like it was crushed...
$C: Username checks out.
$C: I think its a juvenile California Scrub-Jay.

A Mountain Bluebird would be pretty rare depending on OPs location.
$C: He's not dead. He's sleeping!
$C: Do you mean cuttle fish? 
$C: I once had a bird,  or should I say,  she once had me.  She died'n my notebook, Isn't it good,  Norwegian Blue. 
$C: It's shagged out after a long squawk
$C: It would be kind of interesting if cuttlefish came up to snorkelers and cuddled them... actually that's probably already rule 34 right there damn.
$C: Polly wants a cracker. But she wants you to get off her first. 
$C: He's all shagged out after a prolonged squawk!
$C: He’s gone to join the chorus invisible!!!
$C: Here's the thing.  You said a "jackdaw is a crow."

Is it in the same family?  Yes.  No one's arguing that.  

As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows.  If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either.  They're not the same thing.

If you're saying "crow family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.  

So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people "call the black ones crows?"  Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape?  It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works.  They're both.  A jackdaw is a jackdaw *and* a member of the crow family.  But that's not what you said.  You said a jackdaw *is* a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling *all* members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too.  Which you said you don't.

It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?  
$C: sweet. i've always wondered...how is babby formed?
$C: 5 foot 9, 307 lbs gaming recluse here. I've not talked to an actual person in about 4 weeks and have not left my living area in several days. WoW and reddit are my existence.

Security Considerations

>   Security is not generally a problem in normal operation, but special
   measures must be taken (such as data encryption) when avian carriers
   are used in a tactical environment.

It could be a government experiment gone wrong. Maybe the bird is trained to kill itself on capture.
$C: That's my favorite wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers

Mostly because of [this image](https://i.imgur.com/5JPAt10.png)

$C: Notification bowel movement.

It’s fucking perfect
$C: Pretty cool I wonder what the record is ?
$C: Thought i'd be safe from any mention of Trump in here but nah.
$C: Fact: bird feces is both a safe and effective treatment for GERD
$C: Ah, the old Reddit swapapoo.
$C: Yes?
$C: Someone’s constipated 
$C: Did you receive a PM of a hot dish with fecal matter?
$C: well OP's breath was so bad it made the birds ears numb.  and then it shit itself and died.
$C: he did the barrel roll
$C: RIP Rich
$C: He went out in style just like his namesake. 
$C: That trillion dollar company sure does make shitty OSs...
$C: The best OS on the market for the last 12 years? Yeah, oops. 
$C: More like r/2meirl4meirl 
$C: Me too. Special comment of the month. Rare feat.
$C: Technically, they have 'a cloaca' or 'cloacae' if there's more than one cloaca present (usually a multiple bird scenario, though I'm sure there's a subreddit here that can show me otherwise).
$C: Don't listen to these guys -- it's free dinner.   Make nuggets out of it. 
$C: It sprayed diseased shit all over his laptop and face, then exploded. The whole laptop and face have to go.
$C: Try CPR and mouth-to-mouth first, but if it stays dead don't touch it because it's probably sick. 
$C: Scan your laptop with your antivirus. If there is nothing, it is safe, otherwise the antivirus will clean it. Bon appetit!
$C: You can’t get diseases from a bird!

Edit: before people believe me, I was quoting The Office
$C: If it’s dead, it’s not sick
$C: I dare OP to lick the bird
$C: Yeah, but what am I supposed to do?

It kinda takes the romance out of things when you're trying to crack one out but there's a dead bird and birdshit all over your laptop.
$C: It's not sick anymore.
$C: Burn the laptop.
$C: It's worse than that, he's dead Jim!
$C: Pfft panko that motherfucker
$C: Well you can, just not with your hands.
$C: Mum! Dad! Don't touch it! It's evil!
$C: ...bruh wayyyyyyy to late loool
$C: Shut up Dwight! You can’t get diseases from a bird!
$C: It *was* probably sick.
$C: Too late, OP us using it as a fleshlight.
$C: “Holy shit guys, we’ve got a serious case on our hands. Get the radioactive bags ready!”
$C: *One week later*

OP: “Hey guys, did you ever find out what happened to the bird? Got any leads?”

Animal Control: “Leads, yeah sure. I'll uh, just check with the boys down at the Crime Lab. They uh, got uh, four more detectives working on the case. They've got us working in shifts!”
$C: They actually will though. It's their job to handle situations like this. It's like calling the garbage man to come pick up your Little Miracle's shitty diapers. 
$C: Patient Zero right there.
$C: I have before, but I also work at a vet clinic who the veterinarian is the only avian expert for like 4 counties so still probably not a good thing
$C: Might just depend on what they ate.

Growing up we had a huge cherry tree.  It was a competition to get some cherries before the birds ate them all.  Quite a lot of red poop, and it stained clothing too.
$C: Actually, I think that bird died from liver related issues, yellow stool is a sign of liver disease in most creatures from humans all the way to birds. Though liver problems can be caused by another disease or illness.
$C: And I've seen *a lottttt* of bird shit
$C: How have you seen a sufficient number of bird shit to be an expert? Like, really?
$C: Does that exist in every state? Looked it up and couldn't find anything for mine
$C: That's how they got Elvis. I bet that bird partied hard in its heyday
$C: Taco Bell
$C: I feel like OP would have included if smashed through the glass. 

$C: Rarely in smaller species. If you look at migratory birds that cross oceans or fly for hundreds of miles at a time without rest, it's more common. But a tiny bird like this, I'd say it's unlikely. If this thing was tired, it would just land on the nearest thing. 
$C: It flew in through the window, not into it. 
$C: Not a budgie/parakeet, the beak shape is not hooked. Could be a young Indigo Bunting? Depends on where OP lives.
$C: I don't think it's a budgie, the beak shape isn't correct. It looks like maybe a young Indigo Bunting or a juvenile of some other little blue bird, depends on where OP lives.
$C: It's a juvenile Eastern/Western Bluebird
$C: /s

I see you left the /s tag off your comment, so I’m adding it for you. Just in case anyone takes you seriously. 
$C: I don't believe you, you're clearly on their side

I still see her sawing her own head off every now and then, just as I go to sleep.  Then I turn on the light, hug my girlfriend, and pretend that I'm not afraid.
$C: How bad was that movie? It appeared to be awful.

Edit: Apparently not awful at all. The trailers I saw for it were leading me to believe it would be pretty bad. I never followed up and haven't heard anyone really talk about it. But I guess it's worth a try based on some downvotes and positive comments
$C: HAIL PAIMON
$C: one of my favorite tweets ever. 
$C: or even worse...H1Z1.
$C: Or West Nile!

$C: More like Dead bird = confirmation bias
$C: Exactly.
$C: Do you mean saying? Because I think you mean saying.
$C: RIP OP.
$C: I’m not gonna upvote because as of now, you have 7. It would be a bad omen to mess with that kind of synchronicity. 
$C: And some pea soup.
$C: Yeah, a lot of people are commenting that HP made something called the Omen? I dunno. I meant a literal bad omen, I'm not computer savvy enough for HP vs Dell quips. 
$C: I say the sooth and nothing but the sooth. 
$C: Oh. Then it's ok.
$C: Pigomen. 
$C: A bird pooped on my mom's head once. She died of leukemia less than 2 years later. (True story).

$C: Bizarro Disney. 
$C: That'd be creepy if OP did lose someone soon. Good luck, OP.
$C: I saw that movie. This isn't gonna end well.
$C: *if
$C: Pigomen. 
$C: Then it would be bird poop to begin with

Trichomonas gallinae is a bird parasite and often fatal. Thankfully trich vaginalis just causes an itchy snatch.

$C: You people are weird, you don't call the health department over a stupid bird. Seriously
$C: Looks a bit like a blue jay. They're corvids.

Beyond that though, while corvids are particularly susceptible to the virus, they aren't the only ones. Gulls and chickadees are also at high risk, and other birds can die from it, it's just a bit less likely.
$C: Odds are a bird won't fly through your window, shit on your laptop, and die.

$C: Ravenclaw kept complaining about the unsustainable consumption of unrecyclable parchment, so we've transitioned to fully disposable messenger birds just to spite them.  
~Slytherin
$C: The bird died waiting for Windows to load because it started installing an update as he sat waiting to use the laptop.
$C: At least until a penguin shits on your laptop and dies
$C: Random dead birds can be a sign of big problems in the area. 
$C: I’ll need a second opinion.

“Oi Jim come av a look at this bird”

Pokes with stick

Yup. Dead alright.

$C: [Yep, it's wood!](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/816/782/cce.jpg)
$C: Kill.. all... birds... this is for the drill right? ... but I’m actually gonna Kill these birds. 
$C: Open and shut case Johnson. 
$C: That’s a bleepin dead bird if I ever saw one
$C: Actually got a good laugh in. Thank you, kind sir.
$C: He's dead Jim.
$C: How do you know?
$C: Open and shut case Johnson
$C: Hahaha
$C: This is Reddit. Just go with us on this one.
$C: Carbon monoxide could exist in their house that would kill a bird, but not people except with continued exposure.

And there was a story on here about a guy that found odd notes / happenings in his house and it turned out he had levels of CO that left him with memory lapses.
$C: Miners used to bring small birds with them into the mines because of the  oxygen level got too low, the bird would die before the humans giving the miners a small window the escape before they also suffocated.  

Edit: Minor miner
$C: If OP lives in the PNW the bird could have died because of all the haze and smoke. If I can barely breathe in that toxic soup out there it's got to be really awful for them.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Have you never heard the phrase "A canary in a coal mine"?
$C: Carbon monoxide poisoning causing memory lapses
$C: never head of the canary in the coal mine?  They had them cause they'd die faster then we do when exposed to the various gasses you'd find in a mine that could be lethal to us.  Carbon monoxide, methane, ect. If the canary does, you get out of the mine asap. 
$C: It's just a good idea, generally.
$C: CO will kill a bird before a human. That's why coal miners kept canaries in the mines with them. It's where the phrase "canary in a coal mine" comes from
$C: Canary in the mineshaft 
$C: Because this one time a very weird Reddit poster's mystery was solved by someone suggesting that there was a CO leak in his house and ever since then this site has had a bigger boner for carbon monoxide than it does for incest.
$C: Because 

*YOU*

**COULD**

#DIE!!1

#[*dramatic music*]

^(...but no, seriously, you should buy a carbon monoxide detector if you don't already have one because you could for real die. They have combination fire/CO/radon detectors you can get that are totally worth it because not dying is just the best! If you can't afford one, local fire departments often give away detectors for free to those who don't have the money.)
$C: They used to use birds in caves for coal mining since they were more susceptible to carbon monoxide poisoning. 
$C: Every heard the phrase "canary in the coalmine"? In ye olden days, coal miners would bring canaries into coal mines because carbon monoxide would kill the canary in lower concentrations than it would kill people.

If the canary died, that meant that carbon monoxide was at a dangerous level and that you needed to get out of the mine ASAP.
$C: Canary in the Coal Mine.
$C: Birds can die from a much lower parts per million concentration of toxic gaseous vapors than humans. That’s why you’d send a canary down a new mine shaft to check for gas. A PPM concentration that kills a bird super fast is likely to harm a human over a longer time span. Birds are so sensitive to airborne contaminants that using Febreeze around them can kill them super dead. 

That being said, it’s worth checking, but the risk is probably low. It sounds like the bird was sick, got disoriented, flew in the house, and then died. It’s unlikely a perfectly healthy bird flew in, then died of carbon monoxide in the house. 

It’s way more likely it has west Nile than carbon monoxide poisoning. However, checking for carbon monoxide isn’t difficult or expensive, so OP probably should just in case.
$C: The reason they use canaries in mines is because theyre natual monoxide detectors 
$C: small animals specially birds are more susceptible to Carbon Monoxide because they are smaller. so it is likely that this person has a leak that hasn't reached a level high enough to kill him.
$C: He's just hallucinating the bird. And so are we. 
$C: https://i.imgur.com/aDz2bsv.jpg 
$C: You know that canary in a coal mine song by the police? 
$C: This is the first bird I’ve ever seen with a fatal case of halitosis. 
$C: Oof
$C: [deleted]
$C: Don’t worry he’s not dead, he’s just leaving post-it’s all over the house 
$C: Radon exposure won't cause death like Carbon Monoxide poisoning.
$C: Nasty stuff. Just one lung full is enough to kill you.
$C: Mine are off the charts, what do i do
$C: Should reverse the charge on the dilithium crystals too.
$C: I'll bet that the bird is full of it. 
$C: Also the Oxygen levels.
$C: You're not supposed to breath into it
$C: Sorry but that's not a thing. There is no national law or regulation requiring rental properties to have CO detectors. 

[Only State laws](http://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/carbon-monoxide-detectors-state-statutes.aspx) and most only require them if there is an attached garage and/or gas stoves/fireplaces. 
$C: That’s not the point. The reference is post on r/legaladvice, where OP was asking about strange post-it notes left in his apartment. One smart bloke recognized the situation and asked, out of the blue, if he had headaches recently, which he had. The responder then informed it might be CO-poisoning, which it was.
$C: Not true, everywhere anyways. I rent in a new apartment complex in FL that does not have nor is required to have carbon monoxide detectors.
Staff looked at me kinda funny when I asked. But, everything is electric there - furnace, ac, stove, etc.

We know a person who rehabs animals so maybe she can look tomorrow if he makes it and can't fly. This shit happens alot. Crows are crazy. They always dive bombing and other birds chase them all day too. But it's still cool and gigantic so. Well see.

$C: nope

$C: You know what, I don't actually know the conversion for 'canary in the coal mine' vs human actually is. 

I assume it's a pretty large conversion considering the many air toxins work so quickly. 
$C: I suppose it's possible OP's depression to cause the bird to die. 
$C: “Pining for the fjords, what kind of talk is that”
$C: It wasn't, it was a very small sparrow-like bird. 
$C: I'm not offended tbh. Just felt that someone might not like to see a dead animal
$C: So long and thanks for all the seeds
$C: I bear news from the Sparrow Prince! Make Haste, Lemmiwinks!

$C: [deleted]
$C: The only time I see Dell now is if the company is using an IT group that gets kick backs for selling Dell or the owner of the company is doing the purchasing and doesn't realize there are far better products with Lenovo and HP.  

I've been doing IT for probably 12+ years and can say with extreme confidence that Dell quickly became the streaming pile of garbage that it is now, starting about 6 -8 years ago.  Most likely when they started buying as many companies as they could afford.  Every time I see a Dell I want to throw that garbage through a window.

All of our clients are either on HP, Lenovo, or an old Dell waiting to be replaced by an HP or Lenovo product.  
$C: Yuuuuuuup 
$C: Jokes on you, its not even the same species.
$C: Bummer. If you had contacted them they would honor it anyway just to keep you from saying things like this. 


They replaced my fan. Sent a box right to my door and back.  They said warranty was expired. 

Plus I bought it used on Ebay. 

I’ve been a loyal customer ever since 
$C: There should be a subreddit for this
$C: I'm uncensorable. 
$C: Why would you even sort this by controversial? You went looking for something you didn't like just to complain; you're fucking pathetic. Get a life.
$C: What, you’re not going to launch into the “OP slit it’s throat” routine that you do on every other fucking thread that reaches r/all when there are consumable animals involved? You people are shameless hypocrites that put animals to death in your own shelter and yet have the utter gaul to shame and attack others- sometimes physically by pouring fake blood on them. Shame on you, and shame on your bullying.

$C: According to a Japanese legend, if you cannot sleep, it is because you are awake.
$C: If a bird shits on you, that means it has had enough to eat to create that shit. Your environment is more likely to be healthy, which is good for you. Meanwhile, if a bird dies in your house it may have been unwell and potentially brought diseases into your home. Hope that's science-y enough.
$C: I was a little too old for Even Stevens, but my sister was right in the target age bracket, and wanted to watch it all the time.

$C: I am not starting a political argument, just noting that the majority of your comment karma before this comment came from you defending a child predator who is now in the white house, that's all. 
$C: Oh dear! If the OP is in the UK then that's not the right bird at all. That's why location is so important when IDing birds, you can have some very similar lookalikes (especially when you have a view from an odd angle).
$C: It's not a UK keyboard.
$C: What makes you think hes from the UK? He posts a lot about NFL and uses American spelling.
$C: If he's British this is a very rare bird, I've never seen one like that
$C: IMO the bill is too thin for a bunting.
$C: I’m just getting into birding and that was my guess! Based on other comments it’s not right, but it feels good to not be completely clueless 
$C: The short tail with a notch, comparatively thin bill, and dark primary feathers make me think bluebird over scrub jay. Mountain bluebird was my guess on the basis that it could be a female rather than a juvenile (and honestly it's just what I'm used to seeing), but it could very well be another bluebird species too. Comparatively California scrub jays have a much more restricted range.

$C: ...before or after?

Wait, no, I don't want to know the answer. 
$C: There is a series of books written by author Terry Brooks; The Sword of Truth series, which is set in a world of magic. The characters in the series dont *always* possess magical ability, however, and it is suggested that offspring from very magically gifted parents will tend to also posses a high degree of magical ability.  But, such is not always the case.

In the book series we learn of the existence of certain ungifted offspring of Lord Rahl (ruler, and most revered wizard in the land of D'Hara), and we learn that the reason these ungifted offspring are relentlessly hunted and exterminated is not, as one may initally suspect, because of ego or pride, but rather these non-magic persons are what the author terms "holes in the world".  That is - they do not register on the radar of magical persons; they cannot be detected by magical means, nor harmed by magical weapons, nor influenced by magical charms.  And this  makes them potentially quite dangerous to those in possession of 'the gift' (of magical ability).

If you're still with me, thanks! Its been easily a quarter century since i last endeavored to produce a "book report", & i imagine the reading of it has been equal to or greater than the misery of that long ago experience.  Hope my comment makes a little more sense in this light.
Thx for your reply!

I mean, I suppose I could have fiddled with my ad block to allow whatever shit was blocking comments, but lol who am I kidding, fuck you redesign!
$C: No.
$C: I do ACtuALly.
I kinda like the transformation the modern UI in general take right now.

Everything turns into multible device support. The design (less elements/designer needed within a Project, Corporate Identidy), the code is smaller and basically everything looks the same now. Which, I think, is pretty good, especially when it comes to new users: they find quickly what their needs are. Not only reddit seems to take the wave. We need smaller applications for people with slower Internet speeds. Also Apple, for example, made us think we need fancy, expensive shot to make things happen. But they are Specialists when it comes to simplicity. Now other companies see what their users really want.
People are able to find there stuff quickly and be able to Adapt thinks quickly. That's what modern application design looks like and we're kinda want to have it easy that way.

$C: Wait can you call the garbage man to pick up trash like off of your floor
$C: Yes, I had many birds as a kid. Bird shit was everywhere.
$C: I wouldn't have thought a bird that small would need to smash through glass to cause some severe head trauma.
$C: It did land on the nearest thing! It's just taking a rest. 
$C: Lots of small birds migrate huge distances. It's not unusual at all for small songbirds that spend summers in the United States and Canada to overwinter in central and South America. A major migration route takes birds across the Gulf of Mexico. Fatigue after such a trip is a major reason coastal habitat along the gulf coast is so important - even for birds which nest much further north.
$C: Ah, that makes sense.

$C: It's a Birdemic reference I'm pretty sure.
$C: IT'S A BO~~Y~~RTED
$C: ..I hope you didn't strain anything making that stretch.
$C: Such as seals
$C: I like this one the best.  Kept it on bird topic, but with that abortion twist.
$C: Seriously; everyone is talking about it and no one is saying where it's from!
$C: I thought it was a great movie. People hyped it up to be the best horror movie of all time which might be too generous but it was definitely worth the price. 
$C: I thought Toni Collette turned in a great performance. Ending was a little weak in my opinion. 
$C: It was pretty good, great performance from Toni Collette. 
$C: Definitely not awful, I really enjoyed it. But I also went in blind with no expectations really at all.
$C: First and foremost, if trauma to children triggers you, don’t see this movie! I had a hard time keeping it together in the theater (but I think Im just sensitive lol). I think it’s worth seeing! I do wish there’d been more answers, but I’m glad I saw it, at least for the unique story 
$C: What? It’s literally one of the most well received horror films in decades. 
$C: Awful like awful bad or awful like awful scary? 

I thought it was very good. A mark of a good horror film to me is I'm disturbed still while leaving the theater and I was even thinking about it for a few days after. 

The ending could have been better and I felt like there were a lot of things that never got fully explained. Not that everything has to have resolution but there were scenes that felt like it should mean something that never really got circled back to. 

THE REST IF THIS POST COULD BE INTERPRTED AS SPOILER. NO SPECIFIC PLOT DETAILS THOUGH: This movie I wouldn't say is scary until maybe the final 30 minutes. To me this movie fucked with my physique more than scared me. One scene in particular is so fucked up I cannot get the image and just overall situation out of my head. It really turned things upside down for me.

Overall it does do a good job raising tensions and has a uniqueness to it where instead of one character experiencing shit and no one believes them, the "horror" reveals itself pretty early on to the main cast which adds a sense of "where could this possibly go next" 

Overall I'd give it an 7/10. I would do higher but the ending was just a little too disappointing. Before the end I would have done 9/10. It's a unique horror film IMO and as someone who loves horror I appreciated it. 

Horror has been revived the last 5 years. From the conjuring universe to IT to Get Out (more thriller I suppose) to higher quality independent films,there has been a lot to enjoy 
$C: Who said it was bad? It's a damn good film and really goes ball to wall crazy in the 3rd act
$C: I found it hilarious, so did my theater. I see how it can be scary though.
$C: Ending was trash but I loved the movie overall 
$C: Worth watching. Definitely a couple oh “fuckin hell” moments.
$C: It was actually one of the better Big Hollywood horror films made in recent times. Beautiful ending.
$C: It's amazing.  I don't like modern horror movies, but I really liked this one.  Its imagery still fucks with my head when I remember it (really powerful visuals), but the real value of the film is how well the actress who plays the mom does.  She's amazing in every scene, and it makes for a really scary movie.

$C: He's singular, apparently 
$C: Prooooooobably not. 
$C: West Nile Virus can do this.  

But so can mashing your head on a window at 30 mph.
$C: But honest question: where are birds supposed to die? There are tons of birds out there and they don't have super long lifespans. Wouldn't you expect to see random dead birds pretty often?
$C: Yeah. Gang violence sucks. 
$C: Yep.  It's how they identified West Nile in the first place.  Birds were coming up dead all over Manhattan and then a few died at the Bronx Zoo which prompted their vet to start looking into it and she discovered West Nile. 

Interesting little tid bit, there is some chatter that it's believed West Nile may have accidentally been released from Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center (it's across the water from Long Island on one side and CT on the other).  They were working with West Nile at the time the disease showed up on the mainland.  The Center is closed down now but for the last 30+ years of it's existance the place was falling apart, all the safeguards that were supposed to keep the viruses inside were falling or had failed (for instance, there were holes around the vents that were supposed to be sealed so that air filled with infection could be forced through filters to remove the bacteria and viruses that were being worked on in glove boxes).
$C: My guess? Insecticide, but I’m no expert. Turns out poison is bad for living things.
$C: The problem being stinky dead birds.
$C: Birdemic.

$C: Pretty sure I went out and bought a CO detector immediately after reading the story about this. They're like $20 and could save your life. 
$C: > except with continued exposure.

Good thing I'm not continually exposed to my house's air.

Wait...
$C: This is dumb. The bird flew in from outside. Even if the house was filled with CO, it wouldn't succumb to it suddenly, and in a room with an open window.
$C: Is there any chance someone has a link to said story. Sounds super weird
$C: Hopefully OP remembers to check.
$C: But he had his window open?
$C: Also anytime anything happens on this website ever “yOu NeeD to cHeCk yOuR CaRboN mOnOxidE lEveLs”
$C: Where did CO come from?
$C: But why did the miners bring minors down with them?
$C: You made a miner spelling error 
$C: Not so much lack of oxygen as displaced oxygen by other gasses that in themselves are dangerous. Methane and Carbon Monoxide being the main gasses they were worried about. 
$C: There's the saying about a yellow canary being a sign something was going to go bad because of this fact. 
$C: Canaries.
$C: Oh dang they did that in the movie Arrival too! 
$C: Except the bird died instantly here... it didn't fly into his window and go "OMG THE OXYGEN LEVELS ARE LOW IN THIS ROOM OMG I'M DEAD" and flop next to the laptop.  Smfh.
$C: I heard the birds didn't often die becuase miners kept a close eye on them
$C: Not accurate. They brought them down because they would start flying around and freaking out to signal there was small levels of gas detected. They didn’t just up and “die”, if they died the levels were probably human toxic as well. 
$C: Out of all the puns that couldve been made from your comment I'm surprised noone tried to use the bird "myna"
$C: >Miners used to bring small birds with them into the mines because of the  oxygen level got too low, the bird would die before the humans giving the miners a small window the escape before they also suffocated.

$C: Live in the East Bay, the smoke has finally cleared and I can breathe!! The past week has been horrible for my ashtma, thank you Karl and the Marine layer. 
$C: That's not how it works - birds don't just die on the spot from CO poisoning.. it takes a bit of time.

This bird flew in through a window from outside and died right there.

CO poisoning is not instant - as in these videos.  Miners would watch for the birds reactions and behavior and move out.  If they stayed there long enough, sure, they'd be dead but it still takes a awhile for death to occur.

Paging doctor Google: "*A digestive disease in which stomach acid or bile irritates the food pipe lining.*"
$C: Basically chronic heartburn. It happens when you have a lazy/loose LES (lower esophageal sphincter) which is the part responsible for closing and keeping stomach acid in the stomach. This can cause a lot of problems besides having heartburn including: choking on stomach bile during sleep, causing esophageal cancer (this happens because the lining in your esophagus tries to turn into stomach lining, and when cells try to turn into things they are not mistakes happen and it mutates into cancer), and the medicine that helps GERD (a PPI, or protein pump inhibitor, basically it stops your stomach from producing too much acid) also inhibits calcium absorption. The last part is really bad for your teeth especially because not only are your teeth subjected to regular stomach acid baths, they dont have the calcium required to maintain your enamel, which leads to really fucked up teeth, which then needs thousands of dollars worth of dental work. Basically your mouth turns into crowns on every tooth (for the teeth they can save, otherwise they are pulled) and eventually full on dentures at an early age.

While I am definitely part of the crowd that thinks the last couple generations of MBPs have been overpriced ( technically speaking ), it is absolutely NOT because of OSX.  

OSX is simply phenomenal and the Mac hardware just works and lasts.  I have 8 year old MBPs that run better than a mid-to-low range Windows PC after even just one year.  

The work that it takes me to maintain Windows 10 is astounding. Fresh installs every year or two at the MINIMUM.  Constantly battling built in ads, bloatware, and Cortana. Fighting off updates that will break my PC (I’m looking at you Spring 2018 update and my Sandisk SSD).

$C: Thanks! Haven't seen that one yet actually
$C: Yeah, I get that...
$C: Flew in his window, not into the window
$C: Also demons. Every demon movie has birds dying near windows or straight up come inside to die


YOU'RE CURSED OP DON'T LET THEM GET YOU
$C: So I should stop doing that then?
$C: Yeah but there is a difference between dying relatively peacefully while sitting in a tree and randomly dropping dead after a landing i think
$C: Usually, upon reaching old age, birds become weak and slow and are easy targets for predators. Many get eaten before they get the chance to succumb to old age on their own. 
$C: They probably get quickly eaten after they die. My parent's cat is quick enough to snatch small birds out of the air.
$C: I assume they get gobbled up by other critters.
$C: I was just mentioning this exact thing the other day.

Given how many birds there are, why do we see so few dead birds.
$C: Not really...  Usually they are either in their nests or eaten.
$C: > don't have super long lifespans.

[You obviously haven't seen cockatoos then](https://www.bradbaker.com.au/albums/nature/bjb_150624-294/) They can reach about 150 years old. They can destroy entire parks in a day.

$C: Hey, we got five of those two people.  
$C: And no one ended up dying or anything! We did it, Reddit!
$C: I know we're supposed to be lighthearted about this but goddam was that some scary mob mentality shit when that all went down. Very very scary. 
$C: Reddit really did help someone find out that their carbon monoxide levels were too high. I'll look for the story, its neat.

$C: Link?
$C: Ladies and gentleman- we got em.
$C: We have a better track record with carbon monoxide.
$C: Yeah, and not only was it in accurate, but we had tortured a family for a couple weeks, forcing police to reveal the actual bombers, allowing said criminals an early chance to get away before the police could sneak on them before we could hurt innocents any further.
$C: >We

$C: Ah yes, the "Bag Men."

$C: That'll teach'em
$C: Link to this please.
$C: I mean this is cheaper and a good thing to do anyways with nobody getting harrased online and something people don't do enough or know that it needs done.
$C: Suicides don't complain about blame.
$C: There’s sleuths in ever sub. They figure out what OP ate for breakfast.
$C: hey man, when we say 'we did it Reddit!' it means we did it. no questions allowed. 
$C: We did it! 
$C: We did it Reddit!!
$C: No but we did save that guy from carbon monoxide poisoning. That shit was wild.
$C: This particular situation is quite different, I'd say. Of course, I don't know exactly why the comment was made; whether he meant that OP hallucinated the bird (which is obviously false, since we all see the bird in that picture) or that OP may have CO levels in his home that are enough to kill a small bird. I'd certainly like to know why the bird died so quickly. (Perhaps it may have died of shock?)
$C: It's a hit or miss, Reddit also caused a professors' life to be a living hell because he had the same name as the guy who participated in the Charlottesville riot. Even when it was clarified, morons was still sending him death threats.
$C: Scranton Strangler is still out there
$C: Congrats then you sent the cops after the wrong kids.
$C: You didn't find shit. You harassed the family of a man who had committed suicide. 
$C: Eh, I can't ever buy one that works. I take them home, turn them on, bam! They just start screeching. Multiple times, they just go off immediately.

And anyway, even if I needed one, I can't ever buy one that works. I take them home, turn them on, bam! They just start screeching. Multiple times, they just go off immediately.
$C: I had a brief moment of panic about whether or not I should go right now and get one because I’ve been feeling like shit lately, and then I remembered I have two very loud active budgies living in here with me. 
$C: How do you know you actually got the CO detector? It could be that you never got it and you are just living in a CO-fuelled illusion in which you are safe from it.
$C: I just moved into a new apartment. First thing I checked was the detector which had no battery in it 
$C: Do you have any appliances or fixtures that generate CO?

CO doesn't come from nowhere. For example, if you don't use natural gas for heating, cooking, water heater, natural gas drying machine--or don't have a wood stove, or indoor combustion--you probably don't have anything that actually generates CO. 

Not everyone needs one. Moreover, if you *do* have the things and didn't have a CO detector, your landlord or the mortgage broker that sold you the house was breaking the law, as they have been required in every state for living spaces since the 1970s.
$C: My house is full of large houseplants. And we don't have any pilot lights in the summer months.

$C: They're required in my city (when you buy a new home it has to have one). I know because this cost me two fire department inspections. 
$C: *Well, aren't* ***you*** *fun...*
$C: I feel your pain.
$C: No you just have it backwards. Outside has too much CO2 from global warming. The bird flew inside to get some air, but didn't close the window in time.

$C: But why male models?
$C: The minors are the first to go of all the miners in a coalmine.  True story:  children as young as  [as young as five](https://www.mylearning.org/stories/coal-mining-and-the-victorians/236?) were heavily used in coalmines.
$C: Miners, not minors!
$C: To get a finer estimate on when oxygen levels were too low.
$C: Underground pedo sex ring.
$C: They were Catholics.
$C: Lack of labor laws usually.
$C: Back in Victorian times children as young as 5 worked in mines opening and closing doors, and pushing coal cars for up to 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. So, there's that...
$C: This guy knows simple asphyxiants 
$C: So basically OP farted and killed this bird, is that what you’re saying?
$C: Lmao that's what I was thinking. 

Like the whole point of the miner thing is they waited a good amount of time and checked on the bird. It wasnt like an instant death. 
$C: I think it was more meant as a joke for the people that understood the reference of why he would say that. Not that he literally should check the carbon monoxide levels
$C: Plus:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/8i5odr/til_the_canaries_sent_down_into_mines_to_detect
$C: Birds will definitely drop dead before humans from air pollutants. Their size and the fact they have better lungs than us means they'll be affected much more quickly and dramatically. Sometimes even burning candles, incense, spraying air fresheners, etc inside can kill a bird.
$C: They were kept in tiny cages, so I highly doubt they would start flying around. More likely they would pass out and then either die with the miners or wake up outside the mine.
$C: Carbon monoxide is a colorless odorless gas that iirc just makes you lethargic until you fall asleep and die due to lack of oxygen in your blood. It's supposed to be an incredibly calm way to die so I'm not sure why the bird would be flying around and freaking out. Unless I'm getting the poisoning effects confused with co2 but I'm too lazy rn to double check.

The ppm levels would be toxic to humans as well but seeing as how much bigger we are it would take a longer time and more exposure until those levels were fatal for us. Oxygen deprivation can make you feel all funny and giggly and stupid so the dead bird is a "oh shit levels are rising we need to go" type of warning.
$C: Yay! My dumb cat keeps going outside and coming back in smelling like a BBQ and sneezing all over the place. We're supposed to have some wind tonight that'll lift the haze so I hope it clears out soon! 
$C: Plus he’s right beside an open window so....
$C: A human can die from CO in minutes, depending on the concentration. At high enough concentrations, it only takes as long as you can go without oxygen, so basically how long you can hold your breath. For the average person, that's probably about a minute before losing consciousness, three minutes before irreversible brain damage, and five to ten minutes for death. It would be significantly faster for a very small animal.
$C: Birds' lungs are much more sensitive than ours to problems.  It absolutely could happen pretty quickly.

Source - just got a pet bird and the pet store had an ornithologist give me a tutorial.  I'm not even supposed to cook with teflon cookware - she said humans may not even smell the vapors that are strong enough to kill your bird.

Edit: although the above is true I agree it wouldn't happen that quickly and not affect the human assuming it's CO poisoning.
$C: In my experience...at least a few hours. I know this because my mother accidentally killed my grandmother’s beloved canary by leaving the gas clicking on our stove while we ran errands. Came home a few hours later to a house filled with gas and a dead bird. How my mother didn’t accidentally kill us in my youth is still a good question. 😐
$C: No worries. It's one of the many things that should be national wide and uniform across the nation. But we all know how cooperative and productive our national level politicians are at passing common sense legislation... 
$C: No, not everyone. If you have nothing that generates CO in your house, there is no reason to have a CO detector.
$C: The letters refer to two proteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, on the surface of the virus. The numbers refer to slight variations in the form of each protein.

I read in the director's AMA that they were the two scenes/shots/images he had in mind when he started.  One towards the beginning, and one towards the end.  Anyone who's seen the movie knows which two I'm talking about.

The mom character really sells the movie.  She's on a wild ride, and brings us along.  Genuinely scary.

So fucked up.

I'm rambling now.  It's probably been over a month since I saw the movie, and it still makes my stomach turn a bit to think of it.  Given that it's a horror flick, I think those are pretty high praises.

$C: It could have ricocheted off the window too.
$C: Also, better be safe than sorry when it happens right on your lap... top.
$C: Plus another commenter said it looks to be a juvenile. Doesn't look malnourished (to me, but I'm no birdologist). It happens, but kinda weird to see a young, healthy looking bird do that. I agree with making a call. Doesn't take much time out of OPs day to do so. 
$C: Yeah. I've never seen a bird shitting so hard it died. 
$C: That's a good answer.
$C: I would assume even if they keel over from old age, there are enough scavengers out there to make quick work of the body (crows, cats, raccoons, etc.), right?

$C: It takes a few minutes at least - the OP said it came in through an open window and died - so there was ventilation in the room.  It's likely the bird was sick/stressed and died from something completely unrelated to CO poisoning.

I'd look into it further on Wikipedia, but it's way too close to quitting time here...
$C: F
$C: But you'd have to be a comedian.
$C: I see what you're saying. People have different sensibilities. I don't click on links that are probably going to be terrible gore. Some other people must. This particular picture isn't bad to me. The bird isn't mutilated. The person didn't kill it for fun. It just died. Natural death is totally normal and this natural death was kind of crazy for someone to see the way it happened. They posted it because it was notably weird and strange. It's okay of you don't like this kind of content. We all have different limits of what we find acceptable.
$C: Good human.
$C: Oof I guess I just had shit luck
$C: Dormammu!

$C: I think he wore black and purple most of the time though tbf.
$C: He's purple looking imo.
$C: Yes, but you can’t afford it.
$C: Lemme search this ^
$C: I read the first statement as indicating that my parents are Marilyn Manson and Spongebob and the second as indicating that I love the listed three...... seems like the comma makes a difference.
$C: i don't know why but i've always thought alot is one word. Despite learning (once autocorrect became popular) that it isnt, i still use it.
$C: [removed]
$C: cheep.
$C: Wait until you see the bill.
$C: DUCKMAILS (ohwoooo-ooo)
$C: Hippos are even worse for making speedy arrivals, and they balk at the idea of having to do jobs too far away from the water, but the flicking tail will do an excellent job of spreading the huge amounts of crap far and wide over the property of the person you despise, so there’s that.
$C: >an hipster
$C: Somewhere in Portland someone is drinking it out of a martini glass with a crazy straw and mocking east coast culture.
$C: Somewhere in Toronto, a hipster is drinking that mess.

lol
$C: Does a randomly generated bruteforce really count as “typing” though? It’s not a sentence as much as it is a coincidental string of characters 
$C: All words are made up.
$C: I'm almost 100% confident your sentence has been said before.
$C: You're getting down voted but this is more true than people realize. Of course there's tons of relatively common sentences  that get used a lot, but a shocking number of sentences are novel when you speak them 
$C: Good to know! What about a VPN? I'm not super tech savy beyond knowing what to use and how. No idea how traffic is actually tracked.

$C: yes i want 2 know if i'm pregananant how to tell if babby is mine??
$C: Dangerops prangent sex? Will it hurt baby top of his head???
$C: I have retained this style of living now for nearly a decade. My previously abhorrent social skills have deteriorated to the point where I can not hold meaningful conversation in person. I do not know the mannerisms of a normal person, therefore I stand out in public. I have seen my picture on this very website many times now from an innocent trip to the supermarket 2 years ago. 

My self esteem is broke, my confidence is non existent. I am extremely weird. I have boarded myself off from this world because I do not belong. You people do not and have never accepted me, I have been bullied and rediculed since elementary school. I was fired from my only job at 18 for 'weirding out the customers,' but I did nothing wrong. I stocked shelves, as per my outlined duty. I didn't talk to anyone and I tried my damned hardest. It hurt me.. 

My mom wants me out within the year. The van lifestyle will have to be sustainable, as that is my only option.
$C: I can't remember anyone's birthday, but I remember memes and what the numbers of my favorite TV channels 15 years ago

$C: Maintain eye contact to assert your dominance. 
$C: i dont think we're the problem 
$C: I wish 😂😐but nah I work in a fitness company I’m just tired so I can’t focus on work. Thankfully Google told me what it was so phew good thing I avoided clicking it. 
$C: non quand meme pour heu 
$C: 😂Google says it’s nude people. 
$C: 😂yeah I didn’t realize so many people would be replying. 
$C: Yeah, but I never actually go back to look at stuff after work I just kind of collapse when I get home and hope that something will happen that will let me sleep in the next day. 
$C: slurp
$C: So you have to eat shit? Or die?
$C: \*Laughs in Linux\*
$C: Oh, I see now.  You don’t like OSX because of some misguided, egotistical sense of arrogance that people using OSX aren’t as “smart” as you are.  

Well that’s rather unfortunate for you, but I am not going to even bother conversing further with someone who has their head that far up your own ass. 

Good day. 
$C: I wish I was people :(
$C: Yes but “people” on the internet making opposing arguments aren’t really as much people as we are. 
$C: That’s great! I never said they didn’t though. 
$C: The best part is the sense of false security its users are lulled into. Prime phishing targets. That and they are slightly less likely to be technologically clued up. 
$C: We had a funeral for a birddddd
$C: Might I add the OP of the first comment in this thread has a reference to the office as his name.
$C: I'd lean more towards Frisky Dingo, with the quote coming from the Xtacles. Pretty much the same show, but superheros instead of spies.
$C: Semi-erect? That's called chubs.
$C: Not gonna lie my brother is named Damien and I say this more often then I care to admit. 
$C: Poor blind fools!

$C: I had to triple check it thinking “am I seeing this wrong?” Lol
$C: IK LIKE WTF hahahah
$C: Lol parent comment had the title but looking back I suppose it's not very clear if you dont know about it.  

It's called Herditary. One of the characters clicks her tongue hence "hereditary tongue click"

Be warned it's kinda gory (realistic gore not SAW) at parts and pretty dark but if you like horror I highly recommend 
$C: I'm gonna tell you guys right now. You watch this movie, you leave the theatre and start thinking of little things that would be considered "weird". It's a really weird uneasy feeling. Took about a week to shake off. What I loved about this movie there were really minimal jump scares, maybe 1 or 2. This type of scary is just the atmosphere, in a realistic way if that makes sense. Enjoy the ride! And let me know how you like it. The movie is called HEREDITARY. Type it in r/movies and see how disturbed people are.
$C: I looked it up.  The movie is apparently named Hereditary.
$C: I would guess “The Omen”. But I could be wrong.
$C: Bingo. 

It wasnt even the image of it. I can take gore. I felt his guilt and helplessness and the mothers anguish and omg those emotions are coming back to me now just thinking of it. I'm getting depressed again. 
$C: Indeed 👂🏾👂🏽👂🏼👂🏻👂🏿👂👂🏼
$C: 👋🏿

$C: Ethnicities? 
$C: And genders.
$C: I don't see color.
$C: Just downvote them and move on.

Hopefully eventually they'll stop using them on Reddit.
$C: 🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆
$C: Happy Cake Day!
$C: Weird that there are different names for the same thing though. Both words just mean "Disease state of *Trichomonas*," but physicians just picked "-iasis" and veterinarians I guess just picked "-osis."

The specific species are different.

Looks like one is caused by *T. gallinae* ("of the hen") versus *T. vaginalis*
$C: Then there's that one you get from eating bad meat.
$C: Yeah, was just sending what he thought it was 
$C: *lights computer on fire and moves to Canada*
$C: Indeed. I myself prefer Bepis though
$C: I appreciate the advice.
$C: I don't think a bird of that size could manage that lol
$C: I've seen birds kill themselves in wierd ways on windows on a few occasions. Even if they hit a window they sometimes won't immediately die and flail around a bit in their deathroes. 

Could have hit the closed part of the window then thrown itself into the open part doing this.
$C: Damn you, take your upvote
$C: T'was a good question!
$C: Definitely!
$C: Yes, I'm well aware.
$C: Found the safety inspector 
$C: He has carbon monoxide in his house.

That will be $40.
$C: The window is opened. That is how the bird flew in 
$C: Found the Ace Handy Hardware Man&trade; 
$C: I would make sure you have something capable of producing carbon monoxide first...like gas stove or heat, propane, etc. Can oil boilers produce carbon monoxide?
$C: Most buildings require you have one now at least where I live. Though when I cook it keeps going off. 
$C: Shut the fuck up, Toby. Go back to Costa Rica.
$C: I'm good, thanks.
$C: Wait, why?
$C: But only after you start seeing sticky notes everywhere. 
$C: I don't have it. Also I don't have any gas or gas appliances in my house, do I still want one?
$C: Reddit's righteous condemnation of the wrong people resulted in the Boston PD announcing publicly that the Tsarnaev brothers were the actual suspects. This lead to the Tsarnaev brothers executing their escape plans early, leading directly to first their lethal confrontation with a campus security guard, and the police's lethal encounter with the Tamerlan Tsarnaev.

If Reddit had just sat around doing nothing like we usually do, the police could have taken their time and avoided an innocent person's death, and potentially the death of one of the perpetrators.

Overall, it was not out best moment.

$C: That’s the joke
$C: I got a good laugh out of EU.USAToday.com

Thanks, GDPR!
$C: If it's like that you should definitely stay away from carbon monoxide alarms as well. Those things go off the second a battery is installed.
$C: Perfect. You should write a full length fanfic.. I feel like he is an under-explored character. Maybe you could find some explanation for the loop between Dormammu and Dr. Strange? Example: They could be stuck in a Carbon monoxide memory lapse.
$C: If you’re not joking, fireplaces do often produce carbon monoxide too.  Make sure to start an updraft in the chimney by sticking a flaming piece of newspaper or similar before lighting the fire, so the smoke and CO goes outside instead of collecting.

Almost never does burning actually produce only CO2, due to impurities and all sorts of other chemistry shit.
$C: r/woooosh
$C: A canary would work better IMO.

$C: " do you or someone you love suffer from mesothelioma?"
$C: Well that's a subreddit I didn't know existed. 
$C: Holy fucking echochamber. 
$C: That's interesting, but it doesn't really change that birds are highly sensitive to pollutants and will drop dead from them very easily. Way too many parrot/small bird owners have learned this the hard way, unfortunately.
$C: I would say it very well invalidates: 

> They didn’t just up and “die”, if they died the levels were probably human toxic as well.
$C: So was my assumption close to correct?
$C: Please don't be mean :( I can barely breathe out there as it is.
$C: Yeah, the idea that a bird could fly through a window and consume enough CO to die virtually mid-flight is so fucking stupid. It's not nerve gas. 

The reason we know memory loss can be a symptom of CO poisoning is because people live long enough to have experiences and not remember them.
$C: Have you been killing birds with Carbon monoxide for 30 years? How does raising birds in any way qualify you on this? 
$C: Ok agree it wouldn't be instant and there is definitely some other factor that would make it fly in the window and land on his laptop anyway.  Sorry I kind of got excited about my new knowledge
$C: CO doesn't magically come from nowhere, dude. If nothing in your home can create CO, what is the point in buying a detector? Seriously.

Smoke comes from fire, which can happen anywhere. It's not the same at all.
$C: Happy to help!

Of course if I was writing it out, I'd just avoid the confusion by typing it out like this.

$C: I personally like the way RevengeHippo uses their tails to spray the massive amounts of shit far and wide over a targeted person’s property. They’ll even smash up and make tusk holes in your enemy’s car, garage, barbecue grill, and more for an additional fee. Their service tends to be awfully slow though, and RevengeHippo can only carry out their services within several miles of a body of water.
$C: I use an aircraft carrier service. They're expensive, but the shit they drop is devastating.

$C: I don’t know if it’s because I’m a Mom, or because I have anxiety, or both maybe haha, as soon as he was driving her and the noises she was making made me want to throw up, it was just so horrifying. All I could imagine was it being my kid. My husband let me know when I could look again, so I’m grateful I didn’t see THAT particular moment. But dang. But you know what?! It’s just a movie!

$C: While the first two are very similar organisms, this one is not at all related and is called trichinosis, caused by *Trichinella*, and is usually the one people mix up. Haven't seen the bird-human mix-up before!

$C: The true cause of the Boston bombing were the carbon monoxide levels
$C: Pfft, look at "Mr. Safety" over here, being all safe and shit.
$C: I actually had a coworker nearly lose his wife and cat to CO poisoning from an open window. There was some work being done on the street outside, with a generator going. Apparently the crossbreeze through their open apartment window was enough to create a chimney effect. Luckily when his wife went to nap off her headache she noticed the cat was unresponsive, and knew enough to get out.

It's a weird edge case, yeah, but just having a window open doesn't preclude CO poisoning.
$C: Any device that burns anything can make carbon monoxide. The byproducts of complete combustion of almost every common hydrocarbon fuel source is heat, water and carbon dioxide. If you burn at any suboptimal rate, you will create carbon monoxide.

EDIT: If I could stop screwing shit up today that would be nice.
$C: Get one anyway. There are a bunch of stories of CO coming from external sources, like a generator outside a window or a car running close to a building. I had one in my apartment with all electric appliances, and it still made me feel slightly safer. No reason not to.
$C: gas stove? 
$C: Yes.

Keep in mind the carbon monoxide produced by a fire is more likely to kill you than the fire itself. Don't wait for a smoke detector to notice smoke. Get a carbon monoxide detector.
$C: Except the FBI begging the public for their help in identifying the suspects. Double-edged sword
$C: I can't stop laughing
$C: Does it give you headaches? It gives me really painful ones. 
$C: This happens to me too! It's so annoying. I go outside and it stops, back inside and it beeps. I don't live outdoors damnet, I'm a reddit user.
$C: No I mean it's the summer and the fireplace is not being used. Last time it saw fuel was half a year ago.
$C: Why do you hate canaries?
$C: Only if you live in a coal mine.

$C: [No, it's not.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzh7zvXZ_VA&ab_channel=JamesAnderson)
$C: Just pointing out that there's a period in which they can be resuscitated (and since they were being closely watched, it's more likely for that to happen).

I imagine most of those parrot/small bird owners didn't notice in time to save their bird.
$C: Yep. 
$C: LMAO seriously? Stop reaching.
$C: When you're a bird owner, you tend to read all about the hazards that affect birds and what to look for when they are sick, the sources that make them sick, etc.  Unlike people who make extraordinary claims about their scholarship.


I know from experience, dumbass.
$C: Miners would watch their behavior for presence of CO - they didn't wait for them to die because it takes time, like I said.  It's not immediate.

$C: https://www.cdc.gov/co/faqs.htm

> Who is at risk from CO poisoning?

> Everyone is at risk for CO poisoning. Infants, the elderly, people with chronic heart disease, anemia, or breathing problems are more likely to get sick from CO. Each year, more than 400 Americans die from unintentional CO poisoning not linked to fires, more than 20,000 visit the emergency room, and more than 4,000 are hospitalized.

Feel free to disregard my suggestion but making a big deal that its not needed is stupid.

$C: Aw yis champ.

edit: for real tho pls no
$C: Ironically that does got under the red and gold rule if you flip it around.
$C: But after yours there should also be a comma after Marilyn Manson.
$C: ""I love pizza"" is a statement by itself there, not part of a list. So essentially there are only two items in your list and it doesn't make sense for a comma to be between them anyway.

The Oxford comma allows for more efficiency so you're not weighing down  a sentence with redundant words. The sentence ""I love my parents, Marilyn Manson, and SpongeBob"" is concise, to the point, and there is no room for confusion as to its meaning.
$C: If you miss a bit of pterror then you should check out carrier geese - they might not be licensed but they have pretty respectable fecal mass and work cheap, pretty loyal to their coin so as long as you pay 'em you'll get great service.

$C: Greetings from Steam Radiator Land. No CO here, but we got the detectors to prove it!
$C: >If you burn at any suboptimal rate, you will create carbon dioxide.

Excuse me, but do you mean carbon monoxide? 
$C: Did you mean carbon monoxide in the last sentence?
$C: Yes, though sometimes we do accidentally burn stuff that makes sense, but also they just replaced all the detectors in our building because the city inspector was there checking all the units and just came back last week to make sure everything was up to date. 
$C: Huh, never heard of anyone that has it here (no one uses gas, everything's electrical) - we get recommended optical fire detectors by the fire service.
$C: There's a pretty big difference between contacting the FBI because you have some information they might want, and engaging in a very public witch hunt out of the belief that it's better to have a thousand people with no idea what they're doing looking for suspects than a few highly trained investigators (which is what a mod of that sub openly stated was happening, and approved of it).
$C: Maybe you should get a carbon monoxide alarm.
$C: Ok, we raped the hidden message
$C: Oh.

$C: There was a moment last night, when she was sandwiched between the two Finnish dwarves and the Maori tribesmen, where I thought, "Wow, I could really spend the rest of my life with this woman".
$C: Is it 100 percent right now? Or 100 percent right, now? Because you’re 100 percent right, now.
$C: My advanced degrees in Biology and Biochemistry qualifies me and a quick google search can conform. I don't think you understand what experience means. Unless you've exposed birds to carbon monoxide and observed how long it took them to die, you don't have experience. 
$C: From your own link:

>CO is found in fumes produced any time you burn fuel in cars or trucks, small engines, stoves, lanterns, grills, fireplaces, gas ranges, or furnaces.

If you don't have anything in or around your house that produced CO, there is no point in having a detector. Please, don't just read websites and not actually think about what you are reading.
$C: F
$C: Ah, sorry... that role is already taken by *your* mom.
$C: [removed]
$C: I have come to bargain!
$C: AND MY TREBUCHET 
$C: This Is getting out of hand, now there are two of them
$C: Perfectly balanced.
$C: Neutrally balanced.
$C: I think you misunderstand me.  I'm not saying the Oxford comma is wrong.  I'm saying, depending on the context, it IS redundant.   In a perfect world where everyone used the Oxford comma, it is precise.  This isn't the perfect world.  Let's go back to a less radical example like "everyone eats, shits and dies."   Is there anyone that reads that and thinks "shits" and "dies" are examples of "eats?"  The Oxford comma has it's place but doesn't always have to be used for the sentence to convey a concise meaning.
$C: It's treason then
$C: of course I do. I just don't think it's very clever to immortalize 'brand new' sentences because they are trivial to create. I'll create 5 for you now:


1. Macaroni for the mind is a blessing to crows.

2. Instilling fear in fruit takes more time than it's worth.

3. I walked into a placenta yesterday, my boss was pleased.

4. Mechanical politicians are known to be the best liars, their hands are huge.

5. Adolph spelled backward is hploda. 


And I could keep going on forever... Yawn...
$C: ‘ELLOOO POLLYYY!!!
$C: Hey friend! I'm seconding u/xxdean-dangerousxx - if you're on the west coast around the NorCal area, I would love to be your friend! Like he offered, I too could bring movies or my gaming laptop or something so you wouldn't even have to go out.

I also know how shitty it feels to to be ridiculed, outcast, alone. I also struggle with depression and every social interaction takes serious effort. I'd be happy to put in the effort, though, if you'd be open to making a friend!

Things can always get better. And that's coming from someone who also hardly ever believes it, someone who struggles with depression and finds it easier to just be antisocial and alone. I also have numerous health issues that have derailed my life and my ability to function and contribute to society. Things *can* get better, you just have to want them to and be willing to put in some effort. Even if it's a tiny thing, like putting on clean clothes or taking a shower. People suck, but don't let them ruin the world for you. You deserve to be here, and be happy, just as much as anyone else.

Send me a PM if you want someone to talk to! Even if you don't feel capable of being around someone, I'd be happy to be your friend via internet conversations :)
$C: I mean I'll come over. And bring beer or something? And movies! 

I kinda feel like I'm one bad day from being essentially a hermit, so someone who understands that feeling is appealing to me. 
$C: Listen here you little shit
$C: That's why it's in u/domjeff's driveway. 
$C: So is mine. It's a sea of white hands in front of me :-/
$C: Looks green on my iPad anyway. Maybe Apple secretly hates blue people. 
$C: Troll

$C: LMAO you fr?**😂**
$C: I hear he's being investigated.
$C: Haha, didn't even know this was a thing. Thankfully it's not /r/SubsYouFellFor
$C: Thanks!
$C: if it's setting the alarm off when you're not burning things, you are being poisoned.

Carbon monocide is invisible, oderless, and will kill you.

it looks like you're in california [PGE do free checks](https://www.pge.com/en/about/newsroom/newsdetails/index.page?title=20161005_free_gas_appliance_checks_by_pge__help_keep_customers_safe_and_warm_this_winter) 

$C: We'll, if you don't burn *anything* a CO detector isn't going to be much use...
$C: My dad's a firefighter so it could just be my own lifelong paranoia.

Edit: I think we also have one because of the boiler? I'm not exactly sure.
$C: Yeah, but you should pay for a good one. Each time I’ve gotten one, it’s been faulty and just started alarming once I put a battery in. 

$C: Sounds to me like he needs a nitrous oxide detector
$C: So I'm rappelling down Mount Vesuvius when suddenly I slip and I start to fall and I mean I'm about to die. Hot bread Zeke! Just falling "ahh! ahh!" I'll never forget the terror. When suddenly I remember "holy shit! Hansel, haven't you been smoking peyote for six straight days and couldn't some of this may be all in your mind? 

*And?*

It was. I was totally fine. I've never even been to Mount Vesuvius.
$C: Ok, pal.... 

I'm also a Navy Seal, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills... 


$C: Unless you've personally exposed hundreds of birds in a test experiment with various controls then you wouldn't know the difference in how a bird would react either. 

Nobody cares about your qualifications on Reddit. On the internet, you can be anybody and nobody will give a shit.

Edit: every single one of your posts in history attacks someone or something. You need stress relief beyond an internet discussion pal.

$C: it's also trivial to create comments that sound weird when you remove the context, yet r/nocontext is a thing
$C: WAKE UP POLLYYY!!!!
$C: I'm in the NE, unfortunately, thank you for the offer, regardless. It has helped to have a couple people reach out which is something I've never known before. 

Before my dad left he sat me down and told me that life is a journey, one that a man must ultimately take alone. Through both the roughest of seas and the mellowest of plains a path should be rendered and followed precisely because both are equally as deadly to the unmindful.

I don't know what metaphorical path I'm on but it's the path I've chosen and it's the path on which I will remain. I'm happy. To most it would seem that I must be wretched and miserable but the opposite is true. I've accepted myself for who I am and from here I can only grow.

I wish you the best of luck and I hope that you too find happiness. Thank you again for reaching out, it won't soon be forgotten.
$C: Do not experiment with the hermit life, it is not a rabbit hole you wish to get stuck in.

$C: They literally just checked it though. 
$C: Maybe you have carbon monoxide in your house?
$C: Cool story Hansel.
$C: r/iamverybadass
$C: I don't have to have done it personally. I don't have to have personally been bitten by a rattlesnake to know what happens. I don't have to have personally drank a gallon of gasoline to know know happens. And like I said, you can spend five minutes and search the internet for all the information you want to know.

$C: Haha nope. Missouri. Dang it. 
$C: then (if the alarm goes off regardless of your cooking skills) either the detector is faulty (which could end up killing you) or the stove is (which could kill you) 
$C: or at least a carbon monoxide detector?
$C: You've been on Reddit for 11 years with "advanced degrees in Biology and Biochemistry" and you have NO contributions to either of these subreddits?  None? Zero?  Let's see you discuss some of these advanced theories you've studied with some of the members there?  Show us what you've got.
