My cab driver tonight was so excited to share with me that he‚Äôd made the cover of the calendar. I told him I‚Äôd help let the world see

$C: I want to make good humored inappropriate jokes about his lollipop, but ultimately I just want to say that I am stoked because he is stoked. 
$C: Uber hates him
$C: He's not just on the cover but also [Mr. December](https://i.imgur.com/J4wQbxf.png)


Here's the [whole calendar](https://nyctaxicalendar.com/) which features plenty of shirtless NYC cab dudes.

$C: Where can I buy this? It‚Äôs my birthday tomorrow and I‚Äôd love to gift myself something nice. 
$C: I love random adorable shit like this. I'd never in a million years expect to see this yet here I am grinning ear to ear because a yellow cab driver in New York took a shirtless picture licking a lollipop. 
$C: I‚Äôm feeling a lot of conflicting emotions right now. 
$C: makes me wonder how many average normal people we encounter are actually fabulous when not working
$C: Welp, then to the frontpage you go!
$C: It's like Jackie Chan and Tommy Wiseau had a son
$C: I got this for a gag gift for a white elephant exchange last year, and even though it wasn‚Äôt a competition, I definitely won. 
$C: But July tho... 
$C: [deleted]
$C: I got this for my sister for Christmas and she was thrilled! That's so cool you got to ride with him!!
$C: That's lovely. Here is a tiny doodle of this beautiful man. https://imgur.com/otxFESr
$C: 42k points in less than 2 hours.

In my 9 years those are the most ridiculous numbers I've seen other than the Obama AMA.

Wow.
$C: Prediction: sold out by morning. This **has** to be vulcanized‚Äîor are you a true OP?
$C: Whoa, tag NSFW! I coulda lost my job viewing such lewdity.
$C: I like how his eye is focused on you. He wants to see your enjoyment.
$C: I'd fuck him you cant say you wouldn't fuck him.
$C: I'm not gay or anything, but I would pay $20 for that calendar.
$C: Now that‚Äôs how to attract customers.
$C: Buy this calendar at : https://nyctaxicalendar.com 
$C: Aww this is so cute. Happy for the dude. 
$C: UPDATE: I was able to contact Alex (the cab driver) and just got off the phone with him. He couldn‚Äôt believe the attention he has been getting from the photo!! He wanted me to thank everyone for the overwhelming positive feedback. He also invited me to karaoke later :)
$C: This photograph is amazing. The set up cannot be a coincidence. The calendar is highlighted by the cabin light, and everything else is properly exposed too!

Correct amount of light on the face of the driver as well. I can see the city outside as it is not darkened. Good contrast. No blurring. Great camera work. This cannot be the work of a phone camera, or is it? I know the tech has come a long way, but kudos to the person behind it.
$C: 134k upvotes in 4 hours. Gahddamn. 
$C: Holy shit, I did not expect this to get so much attention! THANK YOU FOR THE GOLD! I have already attempted to reach out to the cab driver to share the news about his overnight fame, and will post an update as soon as I hear back.
$C: Last Christmas my wife and I came across this and bought it for her brother.

I was absolutely not ashamed to ask the frail old woman at the counter how much the calendar would cost.
$C: I wonder how my family would react if my next year's christmas photo was staged like this on my car?
$C: He'll be uber happy when this is lyfted to the front page.
$C: The pottery dude looks like an actor but I can't quite remember who
$C: But why male models?
$C: That's one hell of a lollipop, he knows how to spend his tips.
$C: 166k upvotes?!
$C: I‚Äôm having a horrible Holiday season and this just made my whole month. Thank the whomever there is still joy like this.
$C: Number 1!!!
$C: Most upvoted post in reddit history. Wow.
$C: Mr. Miyagi seems to have gone down a dark, dark road. 
$C: This is so adorable. Up to the front page you go!
$C: I honestly never thought I‚Äôd live to witness all this yes in one picture
$C: Just leaving my mark on the top post of all time on Reddit.
$C: Looks like this just overtook "Guardians of the Front Page" as the most upvoted post of all time.
$C: This is a great shot. (Ops pic)

$C: I'd show everyone if I was that glamorous as well.
$C: How is that site surviving the hug o death.
$C: This is so funny and genuinely wholesome 
$C: I remember about 8 years ago there was an AT&T commercial with people dancing and there was a clip of a cabbie goin dumb hella hard. One night my friends and I are getting drunk and my buddy has to leave so we call a cab to pick him up. It was said cabbie from the commercial and we were stoked. Not in a drunken, arrogant idiotic annoying way; we just thought it was dope to see dude at my neighbor‚Äôs house.
$C: Starting the year off strong!
$C: 211k upvotes in 9 hours. Thats crazy!
$C: My work has last years version of this calendar and we think it‚Äôs the funniest thing ever! Glad to see it really is actual cab drivers and that they‚Äôre as fond of it as we are. 
$C: This made my day. Seriously that is awesome. Thanks OP and thank you cab driver for being badass enough to lick a lolly on a car hood for a photoshoot.
$C: This photo has been on the front page more than once... 
$C: OP you're a saint.
$C: For those who like this kind of thing, I found the 2016 calendar

http://www.strangebeaver.com/2015/11/the-2016-new-york-city-taxi-drivers-calendar/
$C: You took one home didn‚Äôt you. Don‚Äôt lie. 
$C: Taxi drivers gone wild.
$C: Firefighters get out of the way, your time has passed!
$C: I can't breathe
$C: Chinese! 
$C: Imagine coming in from a normal day at work and finding out a quarter of a million people (and counting) had liked what you were proud of as a person. 

That‚Äôs not even counting the amount that enjoyed but didn‚Äôt like or scrolled past still. This will be a truly memorable moment in this guy‚Äôs life and I hope he finds out the joy it‚Äôs brought many others. Little things like this make humanity a better thing to comprehend than the day to day negative, frightening view we get from the media and our governments. We can make it work people.
$C: [You can get your VERY own copy here](https://nyctaxicalendar.com/)

I honestly just wanted to see if it was real. This is amazing.
$C: That is the most NYCest taxi driver picture I've ever seen

$C: 1, that's hilarious. 2, he's not bad looking, heeeey. 3, I thought his finger in the rear view mirror was a penis, I had to zoom in incredibly far to figure out what it really was. Thought op was holding up a dildo in the back seat.

Edit. Saw the whole calendar. Apparently I need to date a cab driver because like 80% in there have the physique that's my type.
$C: [wow this has happened a few times] (https://www.google.com/search?q=Chauffeur&tbm=isch&tbs=simg:CAQSlwEJegGqBjHTrScaiwELEKjU2AQaBAgVCAAMCxCwjKcIGmIKYAgDEiisBKYMrAyVBKMMqgSADIwXjheuDKU6uCy6LOYmxiTPMoUkszP2JYIkGjDLGr2q5_1MmRVZIeSH1Mv5Zb0Zd-sbPJq11Wkg-Mny5iY6LXvgThD7xufP-6eODNccgBAwLEI6u_1ggaCgoICAESBC7ztJ0M&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWr-37mc_aAhUOn1MKHX7mBC8Qwg4IJigA&biw=1366&bih=647#imgrc=FLF5S8vlNTqSJM:)

$C: Honestly you are lucky to meet him

$C: I saw this at the mall the other day and had a good laugh with someone else in line. Awesome!
$C: The joy in that mans smile makes me happy
$C: Most of the photos in that calendar just make me think of all those news stories about women being raped and killed by cab drivers. Drivers trying to be sexy on duty = icky scary gross out.
$C: A sense of humour! Neat c:
$C: lol I bought this calendar not knowing who I'd give it to
$C: He‚Äôs like my favorite person right now.
$C: That's it, we can just skip to 2019 now because 2018 is pretty much made.
$C: Mr December ladies and gentlemen.
$C: How many licks does it take?
$C: I can't be the only one who thinks he looks like some kinda wizard with that hat and how the photo cut, right?

$C: I'd take him to the candy shop
$C: I'm in for July
$C: Steamyyyy
$C: I want to buy one but I have no idea where I would put it.
$C: What kind of car is he on?
$C: I just got that for Christmas from my cousin lol

$C: My lady friend bought this for me for Christmas.  It‚Äôs awesome, and definitely being hung in my office.
$C: I hope he somebody tells him how popular your picture was! 
$C: Looking at your picture, I thought he was wearing some kind of medieval body armour.
$C: These images made me realize that I have an incredibly dated idea of what style vehicle a taxi cab is. I apparently thought all taxis were stuck in an 80's or 90's style.
$C: Fucking bad ass. 
$C: he he big boy
$C: Respect the cabbies. 
$C: Fabulous 
$C: hahaha awesome
$C: Woah, that blue blanket thing looked like his shirt and his shoulder looked like the seat so when I saw an arm coming out of the 'seat'  WOAHHHHHH MAN.
$C: Holy shit! >101k upvotes in 3 hours! This may surpass the top of a time. 

Fucking hilarious, but damn that's a shit ton of karma. OP needs to split it 50/50 with the cab driver.

$C: I saw this at the store today and was so tempted to buy it.
$C: And I thought I was a sexy Native American....
$C: Props to the photographer!

$C: Is it weird I find it extremely adorable? 
$C: Meaningless yet meaningful I‚Äôm happy for him that‚Äôs awesome 
$C: Rich gets richer
$C: I bought the 2017 version last year as  Christmas presents for Family members. They weren't that happy, but made me smile.

$C: FUCK YEAH!

$C: haha so funny

$C: that's a good cover
$C: That is funny!!!!
$C: This is one of those things that the world wasn't meant to see. And look, it got 3 golds. Lmfao
$C: Does this guy make eyes for replicants by chance?
$C: He is so freaking adorably excited! Hope he sees how big this post gets. He probably won't but it would be so sweet. ‚ô•Ô∏èüöï
$C: And so you did :D
$C: That is the best thing I have seen in a while. His smile makes it.
$C: Legend
$C: Saw this calendar in VT and immediately bought it for my Secret Santa gift along with a few chocolate bars. Went over great!
$C: Now let's send the OP to the top by upvoting a new post that shares this post about sharing this calendar. 
$C: I wAnt to make good humored inappropriate jokes about lollipop,but ultimately I just want to say that I am stoked because he is stoked.

$C: 2 hours in and already one of the top posts today! 
$C: I wonder if he knows the (reddit) world is seeing this right now
$C: HongKong?
$C: Reddit saw it. Now, the world has seen it.  

Mission accomplished. üöñüöïüöñüç≠üç≠üç≠
$C: This genuinely made me as happy as he was. Lol it's good to see people excited for things
$C: Boy.        That escalated quickly. 
$C: That's some funny shit. I was in for 1 until I saw I had to give them a credit card. Sorry nyctaxicalendar.com, I don't give out my card info to websites I haven't heard of. Why no eBay or Amazon presence? At least take PayPal, this is true art.
$C: Excuse me, but what hell was he doing?
$C: Am I the only one that likes February? Hot daddy 
$C: They still have taxi‚Äôs? But good for him!!!

$C: Slap a NSFW tag on that badboy, it's getting hot in here!

$C:  Just bought two
$C: How cute.
$C: This blew up!
$C: If he was that cool, he‚Äôd be driving with Uber or Lyft 
$C: hey ... thats mr wang
$C: I always wondered whether or not those types of calendars REALLY portrayed *actual* professionals in said professions, and now I see they do.  This was actually an item on my bucket list. Thank you and Merry Christmas.
$C: Same website also sells ‚ÄúThe Comic Sutra‚Äù, a weekly digital subscription!

Love their creative fundraising ideas üòÇ
$C: Why are you paying for a taxi when Uber is cheaper? That's the real question.
$C: After seeing something so fantastic as this on my front page, top post...

  I close Reddit, nothing else is as good.

  Happy New Years!

$C: To be fair, I did nazi that coming. I came here to say this but boy, that escalated quickly so to the top with you! Lost it at 'This is why we can't have nice things' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 9/10, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro. CTRL+F "about tree fiddy" was not disappointed. Wait, why do I have you tagged as "NOPE NOPE NOPE"? Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as "YOU HAD ONE JOB". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. This stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fuzzy little man-peach, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. whoosh. Since rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle. I have the weirdest boner right now.

$C: I literally saw this in Barnes and Nobles tonight. It is a sign that I should get this as a late Christmas gift for my good friend that I met through my current roommate and who my mom thinks is gay, but totally is not gay...no Homo

PICKLE RIIIICKKKKK WOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
$C: Looks so gay
$C: Gay
$C: Is that really the picture they think will sell calendars?
$C: I'm pretty sure that is a girl
$C: Hey look, finally a thread where the president doesn't get bashed inexplicably 
$C: [removed]
$C: Me too! It came out of nowhere- he was pretty quiet the entire cab ride, but was just too excited to share the photo by the end!
$C: The planet express crew tried this once. I'm glad real life is doing a better job of it. 
$C: Stoked for the sake of stoked-ness isn't necessarily a bad thing!
$C: I'm a simple man. I see passion in action and I upvote
$C: /r/wholesomememes welcomes you 
$C: All the Good Humor jokes I know are from the popsicle sticks
$C: I‚Äôm stoked that you stoked that I‚Äôm stoked that he‚Äôs stoked
$C: Ugh, kids these days, getting stoked. What next, chest bumps?!
$C: U sure u're not stroked? 
$C: Now I'm stoked that I wasn't the only person to use the word stoked this week. 
$C: So stoked.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Faith in humanity restored.
$C: After viewing his December photo, I just want to say that I am stroked because he is stroked. 


$C: I stroked cause he's stoked
$C: He needs to do the shirt inception thing when he wins next year.
$C: You'd take him to the candy shop?
$C: Can i hear the joke? I don't get it.
$C: Lil Wayne would be proud!
$C: Stroked?
$C: Let's hear a joke 
$C: Wow ! it is amazing to see... Soo Hot

$C: Lyft doesn't want you to find out about him.
$C: I was in NYC a month ago for the first time in my life. I summoned an uber driver pool deal. My uber driver stopped to pick up the next 2 riders but he couldn't find them. So he barely pulled his car over and said he was gonna walk around the block to see if he could find them. So here I am sitting in the passengers seat of a strangers car thats almost blocking a roadway. Suddenly I hear incessant honking. I look back and its a taxi driver trying to get around the car of my uber driver. More honking. I try to ignore it. But the next thing I know someone (taxi cab driver) is knocking on my uber drivers window screaming, "move your fucking car!". I instinctively yelled back, "it's not my fucking car!" Im thankful the cab driver just went back and somehow worked his way around us. 
$C: I don‚Äôt even bother with Uber when I‚Äôm in New York City. Yellow cabs are so ubiquitous, that it‚Äôs quicker to grab one than wait for Uber.
$C: But New Yorkers love him!
$C: Find out how this man sent uber bankrupt in only 6 hours
$C: This is a NYC cabbies version of employee of the month. 
Edit: typo
$C: This guy actually drives for Uber, he was my driver a few months ago. 
$C: [Well it gives Planet Express some competition.](https://i.imgur.com/6eQJYHH.jpg)
$C: Promise me you won‚Äôt looked at this while at work 
$C: Probably because he doesn't molest his passengers.
$C: Uber hates him. Click here to see Why
$C: Ive never seen a comment get so much upvotes without any replies, so heres one.
$C: Market makers hate him
$C: Joke‚Äôs on Uber, we all hate them.
$C: Good.
$C: One simple tip...
$C: Amr loves him.
$C: This exceeded my expectations 
$C: >A portion of each calendar sale will go to University Settlement, America‚Äôs oldest settlement house (1886), based in New York City and serving over 30,000 immigrant and working individuals and families every year with basic services like quality education, housing, recreation and wellness opportunities, and literacy programs.
$C: Mr. January can drive me anywhere he likes, and he can take the scenic route if he pleases.
$C: July tho
$C: These will probably sell like hotcakes now. 
$C: Y'all are getting real *excited* here. Good thing [August](https://i.imgur.com/nP1Zveh.jpg) is prepared to clean up afterwards.

Edit: He's September, not August.
$C: Is it just me or does [Mr. July](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0639/4849/products/tommy_july_longshorts_grande.jpg?v=1510661882) looke like Shia LaBeouf got stranded on an island, came back, was told he had 10 minutes to get his hair ready, and then they took a photo?
$C: Is Mr. September eating a cake of himself?
$C: I need to find Mr July's taxi route. He could totally take me for a ride (¬¨‚Äø¬¨)

$C: This.  Is.  Phenomenal.  
$C: I'm not gay, but a shirtless cabbie calendar is a shirtless cabbie calendar, and I can work with this. 
$C: Can we get these for every profession?
$C: Ms. October can take me home.
$C: I never knew I needed this in my life.  



$C: There‚Äôs no way in hell that June isn‚Äôt H. Job Benjamin!
$C: [deleted]
$C: Holy moly that July dude
$C: May and July ain‚Äôt half bad. 
$C: May and July can get it. 
$C: My life is far better now after viewing this. lol November!
$C: You can also get a phone case with him on it in the shop. Equally exciting!
$C: We at /r/gaybros have been jerking to these for quite some time now 
$C: so basically the it guys season 3 episode 6.. 

and this is a also a picture of 1/12 the market for the calendar as well

$C: May looks like Michael Pe√±a without facial hair. 
$C: This is gold
$C: This is so cool.. There is another picture of the same cab driver, ejecting ... water..üò¨
$C: I love the fact that these are actual cab drivers. Talk about Authenticity.
$C: This is so hilarious 
$C: omg thats amazing
$C: This calls for a Photoshop battle.
$C: Where‚Äôs the Cash Cab? 
$C: How do you always manage to comment less than 5 minutes after a post is made?! Madness! 
$C: Oh damn, the pottery one is legit hot
$C: You had me by dudes.  I mean calendar wtf phone 
$C: What I've learned from this is some dudes use hair irons on their beards.
$C: These are the lives that Uber destroys. Won't anyone think of the shirtless taxi dudes?
$C: I really wish I saw this earlier so I could‚Äôve bought it for all of my relatives for Christmas

Might just have to buy it for myself
$C: Thank you for this. If it isn‚Äôt already a Buzzfeed headline, it will be shortly! Hope he knows he just made that calendar a thing!
$C: Uhm, Mr. May and Mr. July CAN GET IT üí∏
$C: > whole calendar

Mr. May can mold my clay any day. 


$C: May and July could totally get it. Just sayin'
$C: May and July tho omg such snacks
$C: That's impressively well done. 
$C: My god mr july. Hot!

$C: Holy hell... May and July..  woah.
$C: You  the real MVP
$C: I love this haha

$C: They do this every year actually. Got my mom this for Christmas last year 
$C: I don‚Äôt know what I expected but holy shit, expectations exceeded. 
$C: Just ordered one, thanks for the link! 
$C: The calendars are great! Been getting them for the past three years and they never disappoint. 
$C: I've just realized we don't have a calendar for next year yet...
$C: Grab ‚Äòem by their shifter and let‚Äôs take them for a ride. It‚Äôs the least we could do, really. 
$C: Who knew Aziz Ansari did pottery?
$C: That was absolutely amazing 
$C: Username checks out?

$C: *Added to cart*
$C: Omg check out their twitter feed @nyctaxicalendar 
$C: Wish Id seen this before Christmas. Some of those shots are priceless haha
$C: Cool, just bought a couple for some..friends.
$C: January looks like Matt from Big Brother and July is smokin!!! But the whole calendar is really funny and cute! Id buy it!
$C: This might just be the only calendar I ever buy
$C: This is so cute
$C: Holy shit. Must buy. 
$C: I cracked up at November.
$C: Subtle. Very very subtle.
$C: So hot!! 
$C: I‚Äôm digging the guy in September 
$C: Love the guy eating the cake with a picture of himself on it.
$C: Mr.July had me double taking
$C: Hello, Mr. December! üòè
$C: I'll take 20
$C: Lies there one not shirtless 
$C: Oh thank you for that sweet sweet link
$C: Oh golly, hi July
$C: This is great! I got this calendar for Xmas. December is a great one. 
$C: July isn‚Äôt too shabby
$C: Hellooo Mr July!
$C: lol the dude eating cake with his face on it
$C: Okay, July can get it. 
$C: This is the best part of my week.  Christmas happened this week.  
$C: I want this calendar on my study table.
$C: The one for Mr. November made me laugh at loud
$C: I'm pretty sure I saw something in the bible about this happening. It went a little something like this. 

Jesus said unto thee, "Let there be a calendar featuring mostly shirtless cabbies" and so it was. World peace then reigned over the Earth.

$C: Reminds me of the IT Crowd episode Calendar Geeks!! >.<
$C: This is fricking awesome! 
$C: I too aspire to be eating candy shirtless and in a notorious NY calendar as a cab driver.
$C: I'm like 93% sure that May was in the movie Shooter with Mark Wahlberg. 
$C: Anyone else think January looks really similar to Matt Halpern, the drummer from Periphery?
$C: Ok but that dude is pumping a car tire with a bike pump and it is INFURIATING me
$C: Those streets seem waaaay too clean for NYC.
$C: July is really turning me on
$C: The dude eating a cake with a picture of himself on it while offering up a slice...oh man, what a legend...
$C: I find September particularly amusing.
$C: Mr. August (3rd row down, middle picture) is fucking sexy. 
$C: Where is Chuck Levine 
$C: in my opinion, November is the best, and May is the weakest. 
$C: October in the classic pedobear stance 
$C: What The Fuck is going on with the ‚Äúdishwashing gloves and weird sci-fi movie prop propping up a wig‚Äù guy?!?
$C: Just yesterday I stopped in the calendar store while at the mall (normally grounds for suicide) to grab a desk calendar.  I saw this calendar on one of the stands and kinda chuckled thinking, ‚ÄúNo way that shit is real...‚Äù

I humbly stand corrected!  Glad this calendar was made and glad these dudes had what must have been a great time making it!  
$C: $14.99? [Shut up and take my money!](https://youtu.be/OnB1TgxgwEA)
$C: The poses are so good haha
$C: Jesus these are horrifying XD
$C: It‚Äôd be August year round in my home if we owned this calendar if you catch my drift. 
$C: Holy shit that's fantastic. I didn't know I'd like this calendar so much haha. 
$C: Dnu What I‚Äôve expected. But thanks 0-0
$C: I love the guy eating the cake with a picture of himself on it. So wrong yet so right. 
$C: Did anyone else notice how hard they were avoiding anything to objectify the lady haha the only thing that would‚Äôve been less misogynistic is if she carried the damn thing

$C: How does it feel to be lumped with Jebus?
$C: My birthday is today as well happy birthday man. Hope you got what you wanted. I know I didnt.
$C: Gift is poison in german

$C: This is why I love Reddit. Also I now want a calendar I never knew existed.
$C: 'Yellow' cab driver or 'yellow cab' driver? The contexts are both fitting but the implications are different.
$C: And now he's #5 on the top of all time on the front page 
$C: Not very nice to call them yellow, it's 2018 man come on.
$C: Couldn‚Äôt have said it better myself. This brightened my day completely
$C: He looks red indian,not chinese.
$C: My emotions are clear:

I love this cabbie!
$C: Happy Cake Day!
$C: Well. Happy cake day mate. Cheers.
$C: At first I thought he looked like Danny Trejo, then I got to December and ... I guess he's Asian? As a fellow Asian, it must be late because I was a little surprised. 
$C: Same. Like he really needs to pay attention to the road. This is scary. 
$C: Happy cake day! Have a cab driver calendar to celebrate
$C: Happy cake day!
$C: Happy cake day!üòä
$C: Happy cake day my dude, Here's a üéÇ 
$C: I don't! 
$C: It‚Äôs ok to feel that way, don‚Äôt stress.
$C: Happy Cake Day!!
$C: I hope this doesn't awaken something in me
$C: Dude, Jackie Chan was your cab driver!?!?
$C: We all have the potential to be fabulous. 
$C: Start the meter
$C: Count me in!
$C: ~~Front page~~
Top of all time!
$C: Is this gold being thrown around or are they taxi medallions?
$C: Give me gold and I'll give you a ray gun.
$C: I always imagined reddit gold to be like a ring. Precious
$C: To the top of reddit all time
$C: "YOU'RE TEARING ME APART, JUNTAO!"
$C: ~~Denny~~ Jackie, don't plan too much. It may not come out right.
$C: Haha what a story /u/My_Body_The_Mystery
$C: "You're tearing me apart Jackie!" 
$C: Oh shit u right man
$C: I was thinking more like Robin Shou?
$C: lol
$C: I'm thinking he looks like Bob from Twin Peaks.
$C: did you get an ipod through yankee swap?
$C: I didn‚Äôt recognize him without the flannel shirt he most definitely wears every day.
$C: Something tells me that this whole thing was july's idea
$C: Fabulous
$C: What about September? No ones mentioned September and he‚Äôs clearly amazing.. 
$C: [this might interest you](https://imgur.com/gallery/FSnH1)
$C: July is available as a fleece blanket, apparently. 
$C: I'm way more into June
$C: on the same site, you can by a Mr. July fleece blanket
$C: [Fleece blanket with Mr. July](https://nyctaxicalendar.com/products/let-tommy-keep-you-warm-fleece-blanket) 
$C: I think it's awesome that he is proud of this and now with this one post he probably just sold thousands of them. 
$C: Love this. Great job!
$C: You earned a new follower for this glorious doodle. 
$C: You need to make a novelty account if you wanna be famous like shitty water colour lol
$C: You‚Äôre the cerebral palsy arm hair guy!
$C: Keep being you!

$C: Do you draw for Attack on Titan?
$C: It looks like a Titan.
$C: Lincoln isn't too keen on what he's seeing.
$C: 5 hours in with 146k upvotes and double gold made me do a double take at first! But so did Mr. July *finger guns* 
$C: This still has Obama stats. Look now ;)
$C: I swear I've seen this posted before.
$C: The crazy thing is that it was the late for the Eastern US so much of the US hadn't even seen it yet.  I was awake (and replied fairly early) and was also amazed by the numbers.  
$C: Nine hours, and its 2 million points. And 4th highest post on r/funny of all time.

This thing *blew* up. 

$C: It is because this post is bought and paid for.  You are looking at an ad.
$C: By morning? Way earlier than that. This is gold. Gold, Jerry! Gold!
$C: He stole it.
$C: Wow! Your job must have a strick "no lollipop" policy.
$C: I know.  I love it. I would totally buy this calendar and have him sign it. He looks so happy and excited!! 
$C: He needs you to enjoy it. He needs you to feel his energy. 
$C: Look at the mirror--it's not just one eye that's focused on OP
$C: That's fare to say
$C: I'd certainly tip him.
$C: I'd probably fuck him.
$C: "You wouldn't fuck him"


I said it.
$C: I mean I would, just look at that sexy ass pose. He'd li-li-lick you like a lollipop for sure. 
$C: ITT: Rule 34 for the movie *Taxi Driver*. 
$C: I'd smash 
$C: I'd fuck him, hell I'd let him fuck me. 
$C: You know it, i know it, everyone knows it. 
$C: I'd fook him.
$C: Why would you say something so controversial, yet so brave?

$C: Well you are in luck! It's barely $15! You can buy me some Reddit gold with your change üòÅ
$C: But it's only $14.99
$C: Sooo u wanna go for a ride?
$C: Will you be singing Big Yellow Taxi?
$C: You have to report back about the Cabbie Karaoke! This is the start of a beautiful relationship
$C: Looks like he picked the right person to show his calendar to! Have fun at karaoke!
$C: Yesss this is amazing. I'm thrilled that he's thrilled. 
$C: I don‚Äôt know, doesn‚Äôt look out of the ordinary for current-generation cell phone cameras. It looks like he just asked the guy to turn on the interior light, instead of using the flash (I try to avoid the flash as much as possible because of how ugly it looks, and I‚Äôm no pro). Also, I know iPhones at least have HDR, which would make the city background appear properly exposed. If anything the dark areas are pretty noisy for a DSLR camera. Looks legit to me.

If it WAS a marketing stunt, kudos to the team because this is genius.
$C: That is because it is clearly not.  This post was bought and paid for.  You are looking at an ad.

$C: I‚Äôm just glad to finally see May mentioned. I‚Äôd buy this calendar just for him!
$C: Michael Pena
$C: Michael Pena.
$C: The spanish dude from Ant Man and that cop movie with Jake Gyllenhaal 
$C: He reminds me of Adam Beach. 
$C: May can definitely get it.
$C: A sexy female taxi driver showing her sexy calendar pictures to random passengers at night in NYC... what could go wrong?
$C: Check out October 
$C: Because they're really, really, ridiculously good looking
$C: Did you know Ben actually improvised that scene yadayadayada? 
$C: Why not?
$C: Are you kidding? I just told you like a minute ago
$C: The was one fully dressed woman dragging a cab behind her
$C: Someone did this a few years back with male bartenders in Denver's seediest strip, East Colfax. It was very similar, even down to the single female who wasn't typical calendar girl material. It had a good run and even got some more-than-local pub at the time. I think the humor of male models acting like pin-ups is pretty profitable every few years.
$C: One is female.
$C: You're female chauvinist pig. 
$C: Not yet.
$C: How dare you Daniel son
$C: What are you talking about, this is an AWESOME road!

$C: Because this post is bought and paid for.  You are looking at an ad and they are making their money back in fistfuls.
$C: Because they didn't make the cover.

$C: Check r/movies top post
$C: Second one.
$C: honestly, the whole medallion system was absurd

$C: You see taxi drivers like this all the time?
$C: I see what you did there. I like a good pun and yours was... uplyfting.
$C: Well, between 28 days and 31 depending on what month he is featured on.
$C: Doug, is that you?
$C: What ???
$C: What's anything?
$C: Usually, people steal from Reddit to post to 9GAG
$C: Asian
$C: Look at the top comment and you will find the answer for one of your many questions.
$C: Second on the sub fourth all time i think 
$C: What? 
$C: What did I just click on
$C: It is now the most upvoted post of all time
$C: [deleted]
$C: > all time

it's the top post of [all time on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/top/), not just this sub.
$C: Nope the senator post is 
$C: Ikr
$C: There was a post with like 305k but it got deleted

I think it was on r/prequelmemes or something
$C: This is a four month old post
$C: Well if anyone will see your comment in the future it will probably be bots. I don‚Äôt believe anybody will have time to dig through billions of comments.
$C: So I'm the only guy who thinks the guy on the front of the calendar looks just like Jackie Chan?
$C: It‚Äôs still really new
$C: I am not deterred.
$C: Nope
$C: Why have you done this
$C: Hey fuck you buddy
$C:  she's fucking useless
$C: Ad for what?
$C: ...The majority of Leos are born in August, though.

$C: And who wouldn't want a ride on Mr Vain....?
$C: I got down voted why
$C: It was uploaded 2 months ago you twat
$C: That's racist
$C: Not like Uber and Lyft are gonna stay same when there is no taxi competition.
$C: You must be looking at your reflection 
$C: How do you know this isn't his own country?
$C: Ok go back to europe and give America back to their rightful owners then? The only reason you live there is immigration you joke.
$C: Well, you got him to the top of Reddit, literally. 

Good shit, I hope they sell out! 
$C: I'm glad he did because so many people are loving it.
$C: That‚Äôs awesome man. He seems cool. 
$C: He was probably thinking about telling you the whole time, and almost worked up the guts like 7 times, heh.

/r/meirl
$C: You‚Äôre a good guy OP 
$C: He was probably questioning whether to show it you or not because this can come as weird if you're a boring guy.
$C: Sitting there the whole time driving, telling himself ‚Äúthese guys don‚Äôt care; it‚Äôs a silly pic anyways; they‚Äôd probably be weirded out‚Äù while the whole time you‚Äôre thinking ‚Äúman i hope this guy shows me an interesting picture of himself for posterity.‚Äù 

Then BAM your worlds change forever. 
$C: He really wanted to tell you but didn't know how. "Oh yeah that's cool, so listen I'm kind of the cover model for my union's satirical pin-up style calendar, you buying or what"
$C: So... Did you look through the calendar? 
$C: How do I get a copy? 
$C: Is he more stoked in the picture?  Or in the picture?  I can‚Äôt decide
$C: Tell him he is officially worlds most famous taxi driver.
$C: The entire duration of the ride he was probably contemplating if & how he should show you! I love this city. 
$C: But was there consent?
$C: ‚ÄúMr.November+December2017‚Äù 
what month did he also claim next year?


$C: It's one way of marketing their calendars. :) 
$C: Haha, thats so damn funny.

Also, interesting, he's got some newspaper with text in Asian (Chinese?) letters. Must be cool to live in a city big enough that you can get newspaper in your mother tongue!
$C: That's so adorable. He really wanted to share that with somebody. Thanks for giving him his moment to shine!
$C: We actually get this calendar for my sister every Christmas! It's pretty funny 
$C: You did good
$C: Psh idk what you're talking about, [I bought like 10 copies](https://i.imgur.com/6eQJYHH.jpg) where else am I gonna get [Lady Fry lookin so Fyneee as Zap Brannigan said](https://i.imgur.com/zDTPneU.jpg).
$C: i want to travel like this exciting driver
$C: it's an endless spiral of stoked-ness from here on out
$C: [This is an debate about the dangers of being stoked.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgXObaM9i2Q)
$C: I'm stoked that you're stoked that he's stoked that the taxi driver is stoked. 
$C: There's two concepts in the world that are okay to do for the sake of doing them. To some degree, they're essential to life.

One is stoked for being stoked or someone else's stokedness 

The other is being cheesey. Because in one way or another we're all out cheesing each other.
$C: Some people club baby seals with passion. 

Orphaned baby seals. 
$C: No. You are stoked that I am stoked he is stoked, which makes me stoked that you‚Äôre stoked that I‚Äôm stoked that he‚Äôs stoked. 
$C: Jokes for days huh?
$C: Pass
$C: Nah man. It wasn‚Äôt for fear of offending. I just had a few options and couldn‚Äôt decide, so I threw out acknowledgement of having the jokes and opted to go wholesome. 
$C: Sidecar wants to be him
$C: *10 little-known loopholes your Uber driver doesn't want you to know*
$C: Welcome to the city.
$C: Yeah people are dicks when they use Uber here, they'll request a car and then come downstairs when it shows up, or order a car while still paying their check. So the car is left blocking the road for several minutes and causing a mess. No surprise about the window knocking -- if you're in the way, you're in the way, move. Driver should've stayed with his car, dunno what he was thinking.
$C: Uber pool is a dumpster fire.
$C: Did he have that " oh, i dont know what to say now bye" look
$C: in a new York minute (minute!).   
things can get pretty strange
$C: sounds like Tuesday to me Daaaavey.
$C: I feel like when you are in NYC you should take a taxi cab, just for an bucket list item. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Also uber is very expensive in nyc and often more so than taxis with surge pricing. It cost almost twice as much as in L.A.per mile.


And it would often be faster walking or taking the bus than doing uber pool there with the NYC traffic.


Still can be hard finding cabs outside Manhattan. Also cab drivers fret about going to other boroughs.
$C: > ubiquitous

TIL a new word, thanks stranger! :) 
$C: Uber is less racist. 
$C: We must be in very different New York Cities. I can't even remember the last time I've had success in getting a yellow cab. Although, I'm mainly in the city during rush hour.
$C: Yellow cab usually smells bad and the drivers are ultra aggressive. 
$C: But the Germans hate him!
$C: Same. Just bought it for my friend's birthday present. 

He'll be satisfied. 
$C: I'm not even gay, but January is making me want another man's pump in my tank
$C: Where can i buy one?
$C: I wouldn‚Äôt have clicked without you!
$C: Rest assured the meter was running during the photo shoot. 
$C: Mr. December just got his Owl and I assure you, it was Outstanding
$C: All of the pictures are both very sexy and very awkward at the same time. It somehow works.
$C: November is the best one
$C: For real lmao November got me
$C: August scares me
$C: Hello, Commander.
$C: That cake one had me in hysterics. 
$C: https://i.imgur.com/YIJqb1B.jpg

$C: The dude eating a cake with his own face is a 10/10 picture
$C: The guy eating his own face on a cake, offering you a slice...
$C: Not trying to put this guy down at all, but....last years calendar was better. I ordered a couple for Xmas presents and they were a hit.
$C: "A portion"? how big/small of a portion?
$C: I‚Äôm feeling a bit cynical. Tell me this post isn‚Äôt a well thought out advertisement? 
$C: Where do I sign.
$C: Yeah, would love a ride from him!
$C: You got a body like a back road?
$C: Hershey Highway? 
$C: Fellow human, hello! I think these might be euphemisms, am I correct in my reasoning?
$C: They sell his picture as a blanket called "Let Tommy Keep You Warm", I cannot stress the importance of this enough.
$C: Thank you at least someone else noticed!
$C: I have an August birthday but would gladly come after July 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Agreed. I am moist. 
$C: That's a weird way to spell June
$C: Am straight. Noticed.
$C: July's pic is also sold on a blanket just FYI 
$C: Yeah. Wow. 
$C: He looks like Shia.
$C: pretty sure you meant [June](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0639/4849/products/dan_june_longshorts_grande.jpg)
$C: I‚Äôm all about May. 
$C: Is it just me or does he vaguely resemble Shia LaBeouf
$C: Holy shit yeah. 
$C: July looking like a scorcher 
$C: He even got his own throw blanket with that pic.
They know. He knows.
$C: Fun fact for those who know British comedians: Mr July is David Baddiel's brother.
$C: Oh. Yes.
$C: I thought his face looked like Shia Labeouf
$C: All of them tho
$C: *sweats*
$C: May. Definitely May.
$C: Yes please!
$C: YAS. 
$C: Ya think?  It's interesting to see which random products make it through the reddit marketing gatekeepers.


$C: I'm not even American and I'm ordering a copy. 
$C: That's not august, that's september.  This is august

$C: July is way more attractive than actual cannibal Shia LaBeouf.
$C: God no. He's way sexier than shia

$C: I haven't made a sound come out of my face like that in a long time, I laughed really hard. The BEST shot of all of them. 
$C: Fuck that picture keeps getting funnier

$C: This is low key an amazing gag gift.
$C: Topless Underwater Archeologist calendar is going to be lit.   
$C: Funeral Home Directors Edition is going to be HOT.
$C: Even Sysadmins?
$C: They all can, they're taxi drivers. Did you not read the title of the calendar?
$C: Only if you give her a tip. 
$C: I think they're all male tho

Edit: downvoters, prove me wrong? I wasn't trying to make a joke. Why would 11/12 be male with just the one female; it makes better sense if all are male.
$C: June is hilarious!
$C: I was thinking Dan Harmon
$C: I have no words to describe that...
$C: Sometimes I set a time limit to turn off my phone and go to bed, sometimes I just know it's enough internet for one day...

$C: the hell do you want to photoshop here? every picture is already insanely stupid
$C: shoot, I was wondering what that guy was holding up to his beard
$C: The fact that he went in there and set up an entire functional pottery station at a bus stop for that photo shoot is one of the best things ever.
$C: July wins. 
$C: All proceeds go to university settlement
$C: So shia labeouf is a ripped taxi driver!

$C: And now ten hours later, it's at 225 thousand upvotes! Goddamn, I never knew reddit had such a thing for seductive cabbies

$C: Yes!
$C: Omg yes!  Thanks!
$C: Exactly.
$C: But why male models? 
$C: And now I‚Äôm sad
$C: There are very few female yellow cab drivers for some reason. 
$C: Yea because men always RAPE. Men love to RAPE.

Men? RAPE.

When you think of men, I want you to think of RAPE.

$C: Revive taxi patronage.
$C: He's extra though.
$C: Maybe, I know there are more days for Leo in August, but I'd be pressed for time to actually chevk the census. However, in my experience, Cancer's are pretty damn extra too.
$C: I'd take you more seriously if not for your username.
$C: Extra implies that someone is over the top, excessive, dramatic, or doing way too much. I think straightening your beard with a flat iron is pretty extra. It really serves no purpose other than doing something extra for no damn good reason.

Edit: A word
$C: Suck my dick you cunt
$C: Rip. 
$C: OK, I thought he's in Honkong as I saw the Chinese on the newspaper
$C: No, it's not.
$C: kfc and watermelon
$C: they've got competition between each other.

taxis wouldnt even be alive on their own without government help which is how bad they are. 
$C: Huh, never heard this argument before. How does competition against the taxis help Uber and Lyft? Don‚Äôt they offer better prices and put taxis out of business? I‚Äôm always curious to learn something new about this! Thanks for any info.
$C: He doesnt look right. Looks like he's from somewhere else
$C: Live where? I'm from America. Not Europe. 
$C: [Good job, OP!](https://i.imgur.com/uMFwohb.gif)
$C: 172k upvotes!
$C: I have never paid for a calendar in my life.

$C: Im pretty damn high, and that was hilarious. They need to make another after school special on the dangers of being 'lit'.
$C: R
$C: Woah you must be stoked
$C: Tesla wants to drive him. 
$C: wholesome
$C: Sidecar?
$C: Meah. Since GM bought sidecar, no one at sidecar cares about sidecar, or has left to go work for uber. 
$C: *Number four is walking*
$C: *click click click click* -Simply ask ‚Äúam I being detained?‚Äù Uttering this magic spell will immediately absolve you from any charges and payments. Congratulations! You win Uber.
$C: Number one is NYC taxis.
$C: [guitar sets in]
$C: Wow the mayor of NYC is on Reddit? 
$C: Yeah but then riders give you one star and eventually you get deactivated. It's messed up but riders *expect* you to stop in the middle of the road for them. 
$C: That's why it's so important to check the time estimate. If you are just asking for your check and the car will be there in 4 mins, you wait to order that car.
$C: I have never been to New York in my life but the idea of Uber even being needed there seems strange. New York is always portrayed as being packed with cabs. Seems like it would be easier 
$C: But paying the check should take like a minute max. What are you guys doing stateside that it's a whole affair just to pay for your food?
$C: He was probably looking for a baby-sitter for his car so he can have free parking.
$C: Haha never tried it because I‚Äôve suspected as much. Do tell. 
$C: Yeah? Cool story 
$C: > Also uber is very expensive in nyc and often more so than taxis with surge pricing. 

Damn, really? In LA grabbing a taxi costs like 3 or 4 times as much as an Uber or Lyft.
$C: I take Uber Pool all the time. It's much faster than the Subway if you're going to an outer borough, at least with how shitty the Subway has been lately. I also almost never pay over 10 bucks for an Uber pool. I paid $47 for a taxi today though...
$C: Yeah, I always stuck with yellow cabs in Manhattan when I was there, but out in Brooklyn and Queens it was a lot easier to book an Uber. Probably about the same price though.
$C: It‚Äôs Probably because the yellow cab drivers have been sitting & basically living in the same driver seat for years... in order to provide for their families. **It‚Äôs typically their only source of income, and their families depend solely on the money they bring to the table.** That‚Äôs usually the scenario. 99% are immigrants who don‚Äôt have the resources or language skills [yet] to find better jobs. It‚Äôs also probably very difficult to express ones self with any language barrier present. Whereas Uber & Lyft, many drivers just do it as their side gig and/or are brand new (started within 3 years) to the livery-lifestyle. Way more English-speaking drivers too.

$C: I'm sorry to break it to you bud!
$C: Definitely gay. It's your year man, go forth and be merry! 
$C: I‚Äôm not gay, but if I were Mr. July looks super hot.
$C: Shoot, May and July made me do double takes.
$C: But have you seen May, July, and September?
$C: Nah you're extremely fucking gay.
$C: Have you even seen July though?
$C: I'm pretty sure that means you're gay. From what I hear, it's not all that bad. Embrace it. 
$C: I am not either but have you seen May? HAVE YOU SEEN JULY? 
$C: It's only gay if the balls touch!
$C: Don't worry man, it's only gay if you look 'em in the eyes!
$C: Hey I ain't, gay I just like dick in my ass..
$C: I'm goin after May and July
$C: Bro have a look at the New Zealands firemen calendars, it's enough to make you wish you were gay  
$C: I'm a big fan of July
$C: I'm moister than an oyster
$C: Damn you weren't lying. January nice af.
$C: How can you tell which is which month
$C: January? I mean look at may.
$C: July baby
$C: Lmao
$C: July, holy fucking shit July. 
$C: How about July?!?

$C: You‚Äôre gay. 
$C: There‚Äôs no way you can‚Äôt be gay after saying that..
$C: I've fapped to like 100 clips with dudes that look like him.  I don't blame you.
$C: Yeah, he's rockin' the daddy vibe.
$C: As a female, I'm going to have to agree. May is pretty sexy too (if you're old enough to know the movie Ghost)
$C: May‚Äôs eyes drive right into my soul. 
$C: I'm not gay either, but free gas is free gas
$C: July is my birth month and I'll be damned if I didn't get the sexiest of the bunch. Hot damn, those abs...that beard... Pretty sure I'm going to be taking a cooler shower than usual this morning.
$C: Bro you gotta say ‚Äúno homo‚Äù even if another man jizz on you mustache and use it as lotion.. no homo
$C: First of all, love the username, second of all, it‚Äôs all about July‚ù§Ô∏è
$C: Welcome to the Kinsey Scale.

No homo tho, don't be gay about it
$C: The link that he posted that says "whole calendar"
$C: From the looks of it, the website that /u/TooShittyForYou posted has the option to buy the calendar

$C: [One Quarter Portion](https://thenewheroines.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/one-quarter-portion.gif)

$C: Well they say they raised over 60,000 dollars on the site if that helps
$C: A quarter is only one third of that! 
$C: 0% is a portion!
$C: According to an article I made up they said that approximately 1.21% of sales would go to the settlement house. So far they‚Äôve only made $289 in sales which means that they‚Äôve donated about tree fiddy. 
$C: Seriously. It's the fucking holidays. Why do they do this kind of shit? Give them all of what it's earned. _Sigh_
$C: The post isn't, but the calendar appears to be...for University Settlement it would appear. Apparently they could use some donations, but aren't selling anything more than a calendar.

$C: We *all* noticed.
$C: What do you think normally comes after July?
$C: We all would.. 
$C: Hey its me July
$C: That's a weird way to spell September. 
$C: Can I get a Buzznights‚Äô Calendar flair?
$C: Yes! That's what I thought too! 
$C: Yesss üôåüôå May or July, I'm not picky. 
$C: That's interesting, I think I can see a little bit of resemblance there.
$C: It's for charity 
$C: 1. It‚Äôs for charity
2. It‚Äôs a real, established account, I don‚Äôt think this is a marketing ploy. 
$C: Well I'll be damned, I didn't even count to see lmao. [Apparently someone fucked up the filename](https://i.imgur.com/b0SqnSP.png) since that's where I got it from.
$C: I wonder if he's the guy that bodyslammed super star Shia LaBeouf
$C: ^Quiet, ^^quiet...
$C: This is a hidden gem. 
$C: He seems so wholesome but the way he‚Äôs eating that cake says otherwise. I love it so much.
$C: Wait, that‚Äôs the same guy?? Wearing clothes doesn‚Äôt suit him. 
$C: This needs to be higher up 
$C: "I can remember him"

Well at least that's something
$C: Jesus fuck the confidence that man has. I need to emulate this guy 
$C: If I jumped in a cab with that guy behind the wheel, and he shirtless offered me a slice of his face cake. I would accept.
$C: He eat he own ass.
$C: You should buy a copy and support the cabbies.
$C: Your comment about the sound coming out of your face made a similar sound come out of my face.

$C: Either that car is really small or Mr July is fun size. Either way, I'd take a bite.

$C: Johnny B good
$C: Seinfeld theme?
$C: Or harmonica
$C: Bill de whatsisname
$C: Uber should be shut down.
$C: Uber/Lyft will actually come to your door when you summon it so there‚Äôs the convenience aspect of it - you don‚Äôt need to run around hailing. 

Plus most people do not live in touristy areas where there are cabs swarming, there‚Äôs 5 boroughs with many different types of neighborhoods. More people live in Brooklyn and Queens than Manhattan - if they were their own cities they would be the 3rd and 4th largest cities in the U.S. respectively. There are definitely cabs in the boroughs, but more of a process to find one. 

What sucks is that times when it‚Äôs IMPOSSIBLE to get a cab (rain - never do this just suck it up and use an umbrella) Uber is usually also surge priced. 
$C: Yeah generally the scale of which Uber and Lyft are filling the streets is ridiculous, especially since our public transit is pretty decent. But I'll say that the situation sucked in the outer boroughs because all the yellow cabs hung out in central Manhattan, so at least that's fixed. Still, there's like 60k Ubers and 13k yellow cabs, so if NYC was always portrayed as having yellow cars everywhere, imagine 4x that but they're black Chevy Tahoes.
$C: They're mainly useful in the parts of the city that don't have yellow taxis everywhere - Brooklyn, Bronx, and Queens. In Manhattan for the most part you can find yellow cabs everywhere so Lyft/Uber aren't really needed. People still use them though because it's easier to reserve a car and have one come to you than walk outside and flag one down.
$C: Well, usually, first to have to request a bill. Then the server has to deliver it to your table. Then, you need to determine a payment method among you, your wife, your friends, and your lover. Then, you have to put the money on the table and wait for the server to come back and hopefully see you have finished deciding what to do. Then they take the money. If you paid with a card, it has to be run. It then gets taken back to you so you can add on a tip and sign that you really are going to pay the amount you promised...
Is this not how it is done elsewhere?
$C: LA doesn‚Äôt really have taxis in the city though. it‚Äôs way easier to just call an Uber, versus NYC where the streets are flooded with yellow cabs
$C: Unless you get a taxi pool.
$C: Agreed...and uber pools and lyft lines are consistently under $5-$7 going from middle bk to LES or northern bk

$C: Pretty gay. Pretttttttty, pretttttttttty, pretttttty gay.

$C: just because you're a dude and you enjoy getting fucked in the ass by other dudes does *not* make you gay
$C: > It's only gay if you BOTH cum .. Nothing wrong with being neighborly, and letting someone park their hose for a spell


$C: hmm, liking butt play aint gay but if Matt is hitting it right and you call him up for dinner and you suck his dick while looking into his eyes...thats pretty gay

$C: Are you the only person who sees the word come and doesn't immediately think cum?

No, and I was honestly extremely annoyed by this process when I was in the states the past few weeks. Took anywhere from 2-15 minutes.

Here in Europe, the waiter comes to your table, and most people will pay right there and then by cash or a mobile card terminal that every waiter has.

Also there really isn't any tipping as well (only in restaurants, for actually exceptional service, or just rounding up to the nearest Euro value) which would add time for some people trying to calculate it, as waiters get a good salary (gratuity/service cost is included in the dish prices on the menu, which also already include sales tax).

And hardly anyone pays by credit card, removing the requirement for the two receipts that need to be signed. Usually it's debit cards, which take ~0.5 - 1 second to process with a contactless payment, or ~5 seconds when you need to actually dip the card and enter your PIN.
$C: Over here they bring a card reader to the table, slam my card in and pop my pin in, maybe one of my friends does too since you can pay with multiple cards if they want to split it, then I'll leave about 15% on the table and make eye contact with the waiter/ess as we're walking out to let them know there's money there for them. Doesn't take long at all. 
$C: Here the waiter usually comes with the bank terminal in hand. The bill if paid by the card is usually paid by single person and everyone else pays the payer later. I also noticed during my brief time in states how slow everyone are at bringing the bill to you. I didnt want to generalize but seems like it's common to wait 5 minutes for your bill to arrive there. Also for tip people usually will just leave the change or smaller bank notes with the bill and we don't have to write that down anywhere. Also we usually have chip and pin. Plus depending on card type and your settings (with bank) for smaller meals you don't even have to enter the pin with credit cards. Although I guess banks are phasing that out for renewals and new credit lines.

$C: Can‚Äôt even remember the last time I saw a taxi in LA.

$C: >only if you look each other in the eyes

FTFY
$C: Sometimes it's hard to get out with a dick in my mouth... :/

No homo tho
$C: I wish that infantile and homophobic expression would go away
$C: I agree, and it's also why I feel like I can be 100% gay.  The only straight porn I watch has very little vagina play, but it's pretty rare for me to do that.
$C: That guy has a lot of talent. Very sharp. 
$C: If someone needs to to tell me he's not gay to convince me, he is a little bit gay 
$C: It's only three inches but it smells like a foot!
$C: I think the general consensus is that most everyone falls between the extremes of the spectrum. Personally, I'm far from gay, I'm pro gay rights, and the thought of myself performing gay acts doesn't even feel close to right, but like everyone else in the world I feel like Ryan Reynolds is fine as fuck.
$C: but then again, you're the one with the erection
$C: Interestingly, in some cultures sexuality was not about which sex you were with but the position. This was the case in ancient Greece.

Men expected to be on the top. Women on the bottom. If a man wants to fuck another man, that's fine if you are the one on top. No one cared. The one on the bottom is considered a freak and inferior, feminising himself. 

The exception being age differences. It was perfectly acceptable for young boys to be on the bottom. 

So yes. Depending on where you are and the time. It is not gay if you are the one getting your cock sucked. 

I remember seeing that parts of the middle east still think that way but I am not sure. I am having trouble finding what terms to search to verify that does not talk about sexuality in that region from a Western perspective. 
$C: I mean, July has a sick beard and abs
$C: Apparently, gay people only like one type of guy. If you find someone else hot, you can have your membership revoked.
$C: take it or leave it

$C: You should all try latinum. 
$C: I thought you could only get that in the porn subs
$C: Well, one thing is certain.  You do not work in marketing.  Have you ever heard the word "publicity"?  How about the phrase "publicity stunt"?  If something gains enough traction on reddit, it will quickly translate over to all other forms of social media.  I would estimate that 99% of people who live in New York City also utilize some form of social media.  Many people in New York City choose to use Lyft or Uber because it is currently the cheaper option.  However, when their cold New Yorker hearts are warmed by this post (whether they see it here now or their grandma forwards it to them a year from now), they will be more inclined to use the New York Taxi company.  This post paints the taxi company in a very positive light and makes people associate the warmth of the post with the taxi company.  As many others have commented here, they are planning to buy the calendar even though they are not located in New York or even in the States.  This in turn results in more advertising.  It is the same reason companies pay big bucks to have their brands slipped into popular movies.  Everything about this post screams "AD!"  This has been your lesson in Advertising 101.

 I started to pay by credit just to get my credit up in the first place and just pay it off after a couple of days. I don't anymore now that I fixed it.

There are some restaurants with that table tablets. Where you can pay and tip there. I think it depends on the restaurant willingness to buy tablets for all their tables. 

I know it seems rude, but as soon as I get my food we ask for the check. I hate waiting and I don't sit around and talk. I prefer to GTFO of there once I'm done.

$C: Then you only *think* you're not gay.
$C: the fact is, Taxi drivers are WAY better than Uber or Lyft or any of the other ride share services. It's because taxi drivers have pride and a culture of profession. What does Uber have? shitty rapists, murderers and pervs. 

(edit: im not a taxi driver. im a ride consumer. just observing how ride sharing works, and applying a bit of common sense, it's obvious ride sharing is prone to murder and mayhem)
$C: Sign language is a great substitute, just make sure you keep your hand off the dick when you do it!
$C: I see where you're coming from.
$C: It's an everyday struggle.
$C: I assume Ryan Renolds and Chris Pratt are the two guys most guys would go gay for.  It's a combination of being sexy and having general well received personalities.  This is compared to Gronk, who is extremely hot, but I don't think his personality transfers into Desirable trait a straight man would look for in other men.
$C: I really hope so, because that would drastically improve my chances of a relationship.
$C: Quote is a Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo reference
$C: I think July is *clearly* the most conventionally (aka mass media) attractive guy of the bunch. Though the strong lady cab driver is giving me some tingles...

$C: I can dig 
$C: I can‚Äôt speak for the UK, but for most of Europe credit scores aren‚Äôt a thing. You do not have to create debt in order to establish a financial reputation for yourself. So, credit cards are used more sparingly, perhaps for larger expenses. I‚Äôm sure most offer rewards, but I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre as alluring as the rewards offered on most US cards.
$C: I think you only have to sign if it's run as a credit card or they don't have any way for you to enter a pin (which means that they ran it as a credit card)
$C: No, you type in your pin immediately and it's done. Receipt either gets printed or sent to your email address on file at the bank.
$C: It depends on your bank and the company you are at relationship. Where I work, credit over $35 requires a signature. If you used debit it doesn't.

 But there are two local banks where I live who require it every time no matter what even with the Chip.
$C: It's ok. No one's judging you.

$C: It‚Äôs not a literal choo-choo. It‚Äôs just a metaphor for how you get from here to there. 
$C: [Not even this?](https://imgur.com/a/YYdl4)
$C: Anyone? At all? :(
$C: It's official, Jeeves says so, no bro to bro choo-chooin'  on the downstairs business. 
$C: nobody asked you

Also *anyone*? So you‚Äôre not gay but not straight?
$C: Anyone at all? There's a lot you're missing out on...
$C: I guess I never thought to ask Jeeves about that...
$C: That's why you're still a virgin..
$C: What's manlier than a dick? Extra dick in the mouth = extra manly.
$C: Your age is leaking 
$C: I just love the Animorphs...

$C: nope, just two straight guys pranking each other
$C: Two gay dudes doing hetero stuff; he said a brojob isn't gay. 
$C: Bro homo?

$C: True strength
$C: My god, that‚Äôs the most hetero thing I‚Äôve ever read. 
$C: It‚Äôs like the Nightman comes into my room at night and I become him, I become the Nightman 
$C: Pretty much my thoughts exactly. 
$C: ‚ÄúCome inside us‚Äù yeah, just think about what you said lol
$C: Now that‚Äôs gay
$C: Sorry. I meant to pull out.

$C: my seat is squishy, but I protest not ..
$C: Yeah, why not
$C: That's a whole lotta dicks.
$C: ...

$C: Then you only thought to think to be gay. 
$C: Then you can‚Äôt think straight. 
$C: Pass the weeds please.
$C: You‚Äôre gay but in denial.
$C: You think you thought therefore you is.
$C: And actually thought "no hobo" 
$C: Oh yeah? Well you're a pee pee head!
$C: Looks so matey. See the key to any gold train is comments 3-5.
$C: Include me in the train fellas
$C: Now that's what I call a gilt trip.
$C: You deserve a üçÖ
$C: It needs more 3s and 1s

$C: ....ouch
$C: It‚Äôs Adam and Eve,  not Broseph and Steve!
$C: Yea but that's bro to rope... same shape, different taste. 
$C: True.

Nobody asks Jeeves anything anymore.
$C: Can't believe this is getting downvoted.
$C: Jeez... Is that skit ten years old already?
$C: I think you mean ‚Äúplunking‚Äù each other. 
$C: The only time a brojob isn‚Äôt gay is when a Japanese woman is giving it. 
$C: Ha ha, not a real book, though...it's from an episode of "Arrested Development." But nicely played, CH_GOROG.

$C: Why am I not surprised about who wrote that
$C: The front of this book really should say no homo somewhere
$C: thatsthejoke.jpg
$C: That isn't right. He only thinks he's not gay.
$C: I think I thought I saw you try.  
But that was just a dream.  
That was just a dream.  
That's me in the closet.  
$C: Is deep
$C: I'm afraid we missed it lads.
$C: yum
$C: \#2joke2meta maybe?
$C: Yep. It's why I chose it.
$C: I know I was just... never mind
$C: So he gay?
$C: Username needs some work, like ZattackonTitan or aZachonTitan.
$C: You clever rascal, you.
$C: Bingo.
$C: You're not the first to tell me that, but I don't like how the alternatives sound. Not worth losing what little karma I have. 
$C: Another reddit mystery solved. Time to pack it up boys.
$C: ZachAttack has a bit more of a sharp feeling to it, like a well maintained knife, while Zattack sounds like 55 year old "social engineer".
