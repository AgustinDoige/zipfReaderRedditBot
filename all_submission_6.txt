Local Mexican restaurant used to be a Chinese restaurant. Instead of painting over a mural, they just put sombreros on the pandas.

$C: The chilies in the trees are a nice touch
$C: This seriously made me laugh out loud. When it's turned into an Italian restaurant in 5 years they can just add little plates of spaghetti 
$C: Possible restaurant name - Pancho Panda, 
$C: In Phoenix AZ we have a place called Chino Bandidos and there is a giant panda statue with a giant sombrero on it too!
$C: My husband is Chinese, I am Mexican. This will be the mural in our future kids room. Thank you internet. 
$C: *¬°Pandejos!*

Edit: There's gold in them there churros!
$C: This is the most adorable thing and I desperately want to eat there. Where is this magical restaurant? 
$C: Upon entering the former Chinese restaurant, the Mexicans saw several small bottles of black liquid on a table. One guy picks up a bottle, looks at the label and says, "Yes, you are."
$C: The nose on the one standing upright next to the tree looks like a mustache. 
$C: The panda eating the taco is my favorite.
$C: I feel less depressed after seeing this

$C: Did they do the double braids on the girl panda as well?
$C: Haha they are ....Panditos 
$C: In Phoenix we have a restaurant called Chino Bandido and it's Mexican/Asian/Jamaican fusion and that's their logo

http://chinobandido.com/
$C: The added taco on left panda and the mariachi guitar really tie it all together.
$C: *I'll have one order of the Pork Fried Rice and Beans, and one General Tso's Chicken Tortilla Soup for starters.* *The green soy sauce please.*
$C: There is also a restaurant in Phoenix with a panda wearing a sombrero for a logo. It's a Chinese and Mexican mashup.

http://chinobandido.com/
$C: Now this is creativity. 
$C: There are a lot of hybrid Chinese/Mexican food restaurants where I‚Äôm at. Along with Irish/Mexican food places.
$C: I love the panda chowing on two tacos. This is true nonsense greatness. May money rain down upon them. 

I hope to God they have a few tongue in cheek offerings. A General Tso's wet burrito, Sichuan  Chicken Tacos, a tamale spring roll.
$C: This is why mildly interesting is the most interesting subreddit on Reddit. 
$C: Improvise. Adapt. Overcome. 
$C: New menu items- 

Egg roll Mojado 

$C: Honestly, this is better than anything else they could have painted. Taco Panda, Water Panda, Mescalin Trip Panda, Serenade Panda, and Conchita Panda. 
$C: r/NotFoolingAnybody
$C: Reminds me of a local Mexican Chinese restaurant we have called Chino Bandido
$C: This is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.
$C: Not a terrible idea. I kinda like it.
$C: Mexicans work smarter, not harder
$C: Haha I was thinking this could be [chino bandido ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=86kjMk63PLY)  in Phoenix! Chinese/Mexican fusion, yum!
$C: Why not a pandana instead of a hat?
$C: This is the best thing ever.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Szechuan Cabeza Tacos
$C: Hah! Like a panda would ever waste their calories standing, or climbing a tree 
$C: I believe this art style is called Panda Expressionism. 
$C: This would be the perfect place to roll out my new chorizo and scramble egg rolls.
$C: Little known fact. The chupacabra is just a panda in a sombrero.
$C: Panda Mexpress
$C: I want a print of this for my family room.
$C: This reminds me of a meme I saw in high school:  ‚ÄúPandas are the least racist creatures; they‚Äôre black, white, and asian.‚Äù

These pandas are also hispanic. 
$C: Manager: What are we going to do with the pandas on the wall?

New Worker: I've got an idea.


$C: Panda Hut
$C: I'm seeing epic t-shirt artwork.
$C: This makes me far happier than it should!
$C: Something something Great Wall
$C: I love this: laziness and ingenuity combining to forge a net positive.
$C: My favorite Chinese place in the area packed up and left suddenly and it was all decked out with Chinese architecture and murals and statues, the Italian place that replaced it tried to cover it up as much as possible but the outside you can tell it was Chinese. At the same time there was a nice German restaurant in the area all decked out to look like a high German house and everything, they litterally moved 2 buildings down, not even 200 feet away and a Chinese place moved in and the outside looks German and the inside is Chinese.
$C: When life gives you lemons...slap some sombreros on there and call them lim√≥ns. 
$C: In the town i went to college, There was an Indian restaurant in and old Victorian house that was formerly a British pub/restaurant. There was a mural
of Alice and the cheshire cat. They put a sari on Alice and kept the mural. It was badass. 
$C: Thaaaaaaaat‚Äôs fucking amazing. 
$C: For some reason this reminds me of South Park.
$C: Work smart, not hard
$C: My level of commitment in just about everything
$C: That se√±orita wears ribbons in her braids.
$C: Reminds me of Chino Bandido in Phoenix
$C: When I was in University there was a chinese restaurant that moved into a place that used to be a Italian sandwich shop called Mr. Panino's. The owners didn't seem to speak much english and they never changed the sign, so it became known as Mr. Panino's even though it was a chinese food place. They made really good food and became fairly popular, so in my last year of University the got a new sign. The name? "Mr. Panino Beijing House"
$C: Mexican pandas is now my new mantra. 
$C: That's what we call "mexicandas" 
$C: This went viral quick
$C: That‚Äôs one of the greatest things I‚Äôve ever seen 
$C: That is cool. Does remind me of when I got married to my wife, who is Colombian, I was asked if I was going to wear a sombrero for the wedding. I couldn't understand why I would wear a wide brimmed Mexican hat. It was then that I learnt that sombrero just means hat. 
$C: I don't know why but I absolutely love this.
$C: The panda with taco made me lose it. 
$C: ...and the panda is eating tacos instead of bamboo!! 
$C: HAHAHHA OMG I almost peed myself laughing. This is seriously cute and creative way. LOL
$C: Work smart, not hard.
$C: Im so pleased that so many of you have gotten a kick out of our Mexican pandas. We knew it would get heads turning and a couple giggles here and there. I just didn‚Äôt imagine that it would become internet famous. Our hard work paid off!üôåüèªüé®üòÇüòÇ
$C: Congrats
This is now the most mildly interesting thing of all time
$C: I like that this is the 2nd most upvoted thing on this entire site; beaten out only by then President Barack Obama‚Äôs AMA. 

Never change Reddit. 
$C: And the 3 on the right just crossed the Rio Grande illegally into the USA. 
$C: They must be the hardest working pandas ever. 
$C: Pandas only eat Bamboo anyway
$C: If white people did this I bet it would be racist. I really dont know anymore. 
$C: This makes me irrationally happy.
$C: Orientol√©
$C: What do they eat? Smothered bambooritos?

I'm sorry. I'll leave.
$C: That female panda looks distressed
$C: The panda enjoying the giant tacos is my spirit animal
$C: Don‚Äôt miss the one eating a taco instead of bamboo!
$C: Re-purposing is the new thing. I applaud this effort...with canastas!
$C: We call this ‚Äúfusion.‚Äù
$C: In Des Moines, IA we have a pizza place that used to be a Chinese restaurant. Instead of redecorating, they went with the theme. They named it Fong's Pizza, and their most popular specialty is their crab rangoon pizza.

Pandas in sombreros are way cuter, though!
$C: Cute
$C: I love the panda with the small guitar playing a serenata for the panda girl! 
$C: This isn't mildly interesting, it's totally hilarious.
$C: awesome 
$C: That's *El Panda* to you senor.
$C: I‚Äôve got broads in Mazatlanta  
Tacos, Burritos and Fanta  

$C: the one good thing about Harrisonburg VA
$C: They should sell chorizo dumplings
$C: In Arizona there is a similarly themed restaurant called ‚ÄúChino Bandido‚Äù. It. Is. BOMB. 
$C: Son panditos ahora
$C: MY PEOPLE!
$C: The tree panda looks so sad about the music, and probably is stuck and just wants a taco so bad.
$C: Too funny! ü§£
$C: Panda to the left had his bamboo turned into a taco. Panda in the tree is handing the other a guitar. 

*It's the little things.*
$C: I like the one eating the bamboo taco
$C: Ingenious 
$C: That panda is eating one big taco 
$C: Cactus and chili... genius 
$C: Is this that cultural appropriation thing I've heard about?
$C: Gonna get lost in the comments but , there is a place in North Phoenix called Chino Banditos and it‚Äôs Chinese Mexican fusion food. It‚Äôs pretty bomb.com
$C: I dont understand whats cultural appropriation and whats not now 
$C: I'm sorry, but I find this genuinely interesting
$C: Any chinese and mexican fusion restaurants out their? Ive seen a Japanese Mexican fusipn called TacoSushi
$C: pretty sure third from the left has a mustache too..




$C: Bravo!!!üëèüëèüëè

Would have been my choices for restaurants name.
$C: Kung fu pancho
$C: If they ever close, I hope the chain continues on.
$C: What about the taco üåÆ? 
$C: This makes me hope a different ethnic restaurant moves in next, and they keep adding to the picture.
$C: Working smarter, not harder. 
$C: One word: efficient
$C: There‚Äôs a building near my parents house that is currently a chinese restaurant, but used to be a Mexican restaurant (among other things like and Indian restaurant)... the roof of he building looks like a giant sombrero. 
$C: Brilliant! Appreciated art and baby twquiked* it to fit into new ownership. 
$C: Are those Chile peppers in the trees? 
$C: I‚Äôm on mobile, has anyone complained about cultural appropriation yet?
$C: A. I love it.
B. It would be awesome if some restaurant used a similar theme for a Mexican/Chinese fusion menu.
$C: In Arizona there is a place called chino bandido and it‚Äôs Mexican Chinese. I thought this was a picture of chinos for a sec lol 
$C: u/georgiahippie
$C: The taco in one of the Pandas is a nice touch.
$C: THIS is what makes America great.üòä
$C: Any chance this is Chino Bandito?! I love that shit!
$C: Reminds me of Chino Bandito in phoenix. The only place I know to get Chinese Mexican fusion.

Jade Pork BURRITOOOOOO GOOOO
$C: They're evolving
$C: I‚Äôm my town we had a Mexican restaurant called ‚ÄúTacos‚Äù (very small town, creative naming not necessary)  and we had a pizza restaurant called ‚ÄúMezzaluna Pizza‚Äù that moved into the same spot. Upon learning that the mandatory sign letters were $1200 ea, they renamed their business ‚ÄúcoasT pizza‚Äù
$C: This should be the standard at all restaurants!  I love it!
$C: Pshh... Please, in Phoenix we've had this for a while. http://chinobandido.com/
$C: Reminds me of Chino Bandidos in Phoenix. Dammit now I want snickerdoodles.
$C: Aw that's adorable.
$C: Now I just want Chino. Thanks.
$C: And mustaches. 
$C: I love the taco eating panda.
$C: Like Wong‚Äôs Scottish Meat Pies
$C: Panditos. 
$C: One of the best restaurants I've been to was chino bandito.  Mexican/Chinese fusion.  Their mascot is a panda wearing a sombrero
$C: ƒ∞ love pandas
$C: 6th St in Austin, Texas used to have a nice little place called El Chino; served Chinese and Mexican; great deal for lunch; Chinese with chips and salsa appetizer was one of my faves. 
$C: Fun fact: the only non-Chinese pandas are Mexican. 
$C: I love America.  (This is in North America, right?)
$C: That's one of the most American things I've seen.
$C: Their little ears peeking above the sombreros are so cute!
$C: r/frugal lol
$C: If those were MAGA hats this would be racist. 
$C: .^.^.^.^.^ENHANCED
$C: There‚Äôs a pizza restaurant near me called ‚ÄúcoasT‚Äù because it used to be a taco place and they already had the sign letters. 
$C: And moustaches I'm assuming? 
$C: Ohio? We had a Chinese place in my town that decided to add Mexican food to the menu and keep the Chinese as well
$C: LOL! This is fucking hilarious!
$C: There's a Chinese Mexican restaurant in Brooklyn
$C: Then, if they want to go to a Sci-Fi theme, they could just convert the pandas to porgs. With sombreros.
$C: That's called Asian Fusion
$C: Mexican ingenuity, we can make anything work, even making Mexican pandas
$C: That's a lotta upvotes OP

You mind sharing some?
$C: The panda on the left with a lil taco...my heart!
$C: Is this El Sol?
$C: And now it's the most up voted post in r/mildlyinteresting
$C: That's how you work around the budget.
$C: Doing God‚Äôs work.
$C: Hold up... What state is this in? There is a Chinese restaurant in my hometown that just got converted to a Mexican restaurant and it has a mural in it almost identical to this.
$C: What do you call a Mexican Eggroll?



A Burrito 





  ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
$C: I just really want to know how that conversation went... probably stood there, in painting overalls, leaning back and just looked at each other and nodded. 
Love it. 
$C: That's adorable!
$C: Thanks for this. My mom and I had a good laugh and watching her laugh is one of my favorite things.
$C: Is the panda on the left eating a taco?
$C: Did anyone think to ask the pandas how they felt about the sombreros? 
$C: I love this, quirkiness at it's best, well done pandamigos!
$C: r/mildlyracist 
$C: This needs to be a shirt
$C: It's a sombrero panda- mic
$C: As a Mexican with a Chinese wife, this is basically my household.
$C: I like how that one panda is eating a giant taco. 
$C: This is El Sol in Harrisonburg, Virginia.
$C: There‚Äôs a restaurant in Phoenix Arizona called chino bandidos with the same decor taste lol. They serve Chinese Mexican Jamaican fusion food. Uh-mazing.
$C: TIL there are 181k reddit users because no one on the internet can scroll past this without liking it
$C: PANDITOS
$C: r/pocointeresante
$C: U/kubm
$C: This straight up made my day! 
$C: Around here, the mexican restaurants share a kitchen with the chinese restaurants- same owner and phone number, different storefronts.

The one I used to go to was Fresh Taco King/King Wah. Looks like the taco part has closed now, that's a shame, but there's still New King Wah.
$C: This is great! This is my favorite place to go for Mexican, so pretty cool to see them on here. I don't know why I never thought to post it online.
$C: I had the exact opposite in my hometown. Chinese buffet built in the Spanish mission-style Mexican restaurant that closed down. Used their sombrero art and everything.
$C: The braids tho. Panda grows hair on the head. Osmhdiqksix hwmnxjw ! Geniusness.
$C: My local chinese restaurant is also a mexican restaurant.
$C: Sneak 100
$C: congrats you're the top upvoted post of all time
$C: As a Mexican with a Chinese wife, I can really appreciate this.
$C: A scene from Kung Fu Panda IV
$C: truly peak mildly interesting
$C: Nice !

$C: El Sol? Harrisonburg VA?
$C: H.  Hh
$C: r/sombreropandas
$C: Hold it!  Did they just appropriate Chinese culture?  s/
$C: You in Raleigh?
$C: Que g√ºenos lo pandas! Viva Mexico motherfucker!
$C: I know this place, I remember seeing it and thought it was pretty clever, didn't think to post it though lol. El Sol Mexican restaurant, Harrisonburg VA. 

$C: Despacito, pandas wearing sombreros eating burritos 
$C: amazing
$C: Silly Pandejos
$C: Yo wtf this just beat Obama's ama
$C: Man. Now I wonder how a fusion mexican Chinese restaurant would be. I can't already feel my butthole burning trying to eat some general tso chicken tacos with some housemade salsa. 
$C: I love it
$C: And mustaches and a taco!
$C: Pandas would probably be less endangered if they actually learned to eat tacos instead of bamboo.
$C: +10 cultural appropriation 
$C: I wanna know something from Mr. Panda Bear here. If you pandas are from mountainous areas of China and Tibet, how come you only eat tacos which is prone to be made in dryer, more arid regions?
$C: In 10 years it will be a French restaurant and they‚Äôll put on moustaches on their faces and berets on top of the sombreros.  Jump 10 more years, now it‚Äôs a Shawarma place, all the pandas wear turbans and hijabs below the sombreros.  In 100 years this place will have quite the story to tell
$C: We have a Restaurant local to Phoenix, AZ called Chinobandidos. Mexican-Chinese fusion. 

It's so good. 
$C: Don't you mean som*bear*o?!?
$C: Something something cultural appropriation something. 
$C: Cinco de Mayo, people must look at that mural and be like "Yup, had 1 too many Margaritas" Before they realize it's real.
$C: This is pretty adorable üòÜ 

PANDAS WITH SOMBREROS
$C: Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.
$C: On a somewhat related note, are there Chinese Mexican restaurants out there?
$C: This is something only white people could get offended by for other people. When truly, its hilarious and genius.
$C: This is fantastic.  I would go there in a heartbeat 
$C: I love it.
$C: "Try our Saki Margaritas!"
$C: This would be considered racist if some other nationality took something and put a sombrero on it and called it Mexican 
$C: Taking "lazy mexican" stereotypes to a new level.
$C: This is adorable, we're there any more paintings?
$C: Not at all Mild...That shit is Ghost.
$C: As a New Yorker, I'd be to the moon by getting delicious Chinese with delicious TeX-MeX.
$C: Wild Panda-**ejo!**
$C: I'll have the wonton taco.
$C: I bet they mke bitchin Margarita pitchers
$C: Why waste good panda?
$C: I'm wondering how did they get to that solution, probably it was something like... que hacemos con los pandas?.......Meeeh, dibujales unos sombreros y ya hombre..
$C: This is pretty great.
$C: i'll have one order of Gen. Changs chicken fajita, please. can I have that with rice tortillas?
$C: That's pretty great, reminds me of a Mexican restaurant in MN that had a neon "Pizza" sign in the window that they never turned on and some Italian looking ingredient posters on the wall.  
$C: What happens if an Italian place takes over then?
$C: This is gold!
$C: And added chilis to the trees. and a taco and guitar
$C: It's going to be a hipster bar after this and they won't change a damn thing. 
$C: I‚Äôm pretty sure most small town people are clicking on this thinking it‚Äôs going to be of their restaurant. 
$C: I would eat here.
$C: Hey that panda has 2 tacos!
$C: They should serve some Chinese food. Hakka is Indian style chinese food. They have it in Toronto. It's great. Mexican style Chinese food might be interesting
$C: Found my new desktop background.
$C: This is the only thing that has made me smile today. 
$C: I guess it's like the saying goes.  If life gives you lemons, paint sombreros on them
And serve a lunch taquito special
$C: I love this 
$C: If it ain't broke...
$C: Ah those pandajos
$C: And mustaches

$C: Mexicellent.
$C: If you think about it, they still did paint over a mural
$C: The one on the left is eating fucking tacos!!! I need this one a t shirt.
$C: And little mustaches 
$C: This is glorious 
$C: When the Spanish version of Po finds his way to this restaurant, he will be pleased.
$C: Is that a panda eating a taco? 
$C: Lazy and effective at the same time, that's hard to pull off 
$C: This would've been perfect for Chino Bandito's in Phoenix.
$C: I like the one eating a taco. 
$C: Would‚Äôve made them much bigger though
$C: I hope they named the place Panditos.
$C: Los panda casa
$C: Chexican
$C: Ayyy l'Mao
$C: ...And chilli's in the trees, one panda eating a taco, and another serenading his lady in the tree with a machismo mustache.
$C: [Looks like Chino Bandidos aka heaven on earth.](http://chinobandido.com/)
$C: In Arizona we have a restaurant that is a Mexican Chinese mix, it‚Äôs wonderful. [Chinos - Check them out here](http://chinobandido.com) 
$C: Smart 
$C: It's perfect
$C: Right?! Who knew there was more than one place with pandas wearing sombreros?! You know what that place probably doesn‚Äôt have...JADE RED SAUCE & soft snickerdoodles! 
$C: This makes me happy. I‚Äôve done a number of murals on restaurant walls and so far, even changing hands, no one had painted over any of them. 
$C: Mildly interesting, my ass. This is amazing.
$C: I see Reddit is still doing blatant advertisements
$C: Wasabi Juan‚Äôs!!! 
$C: We have a local Chinese restaurant that used to be Mexican. Still has adobe tiles in the dining room. 
$C: When life gives you pandas...
$C: Panderos 
$C: You made no mention of the fact that one of the pandas is definitely eating a taco.
$C: I'm happy now.
$C: And one is eating tacos
$C: They should convert the mountain in the background into an Aztec pyramid!
$C: LOL, took me soooo long to realize that there was chili peppers in the tree
$C: Omg üòÇüòÇ I wanna go there so bad right now.
$C: Is that a hard shell taco that the panda is eating? 
$C: r/actlikeyoubelong
$C: We Mexicans are so petty lmao. 
$C: The panda in the middle looks like he has one eyebrow raised.  I feel like he's judging us.  "Really, you think this is cute?  You let them paint a sombrero on me?"
$C: Plot twist: it's Asians working in the kitchen
$C: Now i wanna see Mexican and Chinese couple
$C: [Chino Bandido](http://chinobandido.com/) is a restaurant Asian/Mexican fusion place here in Phoenix with a similar logo, a panda Pancho Villa. Killer eats of you're ever in PHX.
$C: And eating the taco!
$C: Similar to Giovanni Changs on the loud house.
$C: Love it.
$C: I used to go to a Chinese restaurant that had the same mural but without the Mexican flair. Wonder how common the painting is
$C: Cuteeeeeee
$C: Hometown on the front page! I have almost posted this before :)
$C: [Chexican!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DK1L4auH_A&t=16s)  The mural even looks similar.
$C: Trying to do the best with the minimal effort. I'm sad üòî
$C: Here, have my upvote.
$C: Haha that's so lazy 
$C: I'd eat the ass out of a panda taco 
$C: The far left panda is eating a taco lmao
$C: Lol
$C: 
Hey /u/Bombaskos,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
$C: this is so fucking cute!
$C: dont forget one of them is eating 2 tacos!!!!!!!!!
$C: r/frugal
$C: wow, the pandas are cute and pretty
$C: The owners have a good sense of vision
$C: [Literally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=9&v=cUN9sX86ZwA) all I can hear.  
  
Fuck you South Park
$C: Multiculturalism?
$C: I'd love to meet the desiigner
$C: Also changed are:

1. Panda eating Taco

2. Panda playing Banjo(?)

3. Panda in Pigtails and  Headbow

4. RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS! 
$C: Reminds me of Chino Bandido in Phoenix, AZ.
$C: If it was a different animal it could back fire really bad. That happened with Tacos Felix in Monterrey some years ago, they had [felix the cat](https://www.google.com.mx/search?q=felix+the+cat&oq=felix+the+cat&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59l2j69i61j69i60j69i61.3193j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) as their logo and painted in some walls then people started a rumour that the meat used was from cats. They had to change name and logo of the business and also now [state "100% beef" in their new logo](http://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/facilite/V3/objeto/logo/1453403534-pipe.jpeg) because of this.
$C: I swear we have a chinese restaurant in my town in Demkar that has the exact same motif painted on a their wall, except way prettier.
$C: Thats awesome, I love seeing small buisness owners using frugil tactics in a creative way.
$C: Place near us used to be a KFC, turned Mexican restaurant. Col. Sanders etched in glass now sports a lovely sombrero.  
$C: I went to a chinese-mexican fusion joint called Chino Bandito once when I was in AZ. It was awesome! It had a panda with a bandoleer and a sombrero, IIRC. 
$C: I can't wait until they become an Italian restaurant and then suddenly each panda has a plate of Spaghetti. 
$C: In some regions pandas have been known to wear sombreros 
$C: chinese mehicahn food hmmmm
$C: This is hilarious problem solving. Love it. 
$C: But chinese food is wayyyyy better
$C: This is quality content
$C: Where is the wall? The great wall. 
$C: And they replaced the bamboo in the one pandas arm with a taco
$C: /r/frugal
$C: That is so brilliant!
$C: This is the best "fix" ever
$C: There's a Chinese restaurant in my area that shares the building with a panaderia.
$C: omg, that is amazing!! Where is this?  I would love to see it in person.
$C: Bruh, I laughed so hard at this. It reminds of the Chinese Shoprite near where I work. At first I thought it was a former Chinese restaurant converted to a grocery store, but they have dragons on the aisle number signs.

$C: Aww I love this 
$C: There,  I fixed it.

$C: Work smarter, not harder 
$C: Bola de pandajos!
$C: Lmao I like it better this way
$C: ...and added a corn instead of a bamboo 
$C: I like the panda with the tacos
$C: I hope they have at least one mixed dish like Kung Pao Taco's, Lo Mein con Queso, or Won Ton Mole.
$C: I sense a fusion restaurant. Coming soon
$C: Far right with the hair 
$C: Win
$C: El Sol was good eating when it was in downtown Harrisonburg. Wonder how it is with the new relocation 
$C: Reminds me of a restaurant back in Phoenix Chino Bandito, a Mexican/Chinese restaurant that was awesome. Huge Panda statue out front wearing a sombrero and bandoliers.
$C: Aren't all restaurants Mexican restaurants once you go in the back? At least in Arizona and California they are. 
$C: This is incredible 
$C: They also added tacos, an (apparently cheap knock-off brand) acoustic guitar and some ~~cactus~~ *nopales*. 

What they need to add is a mural of an Aztec Panda warrior carrying a limp Panda female inside a zoo cage with the words "NO SE PUEDE".
$C: Looks like the panda in the tree has "boobs on its head" like the guy in the movie "Little Nikki" 
$C: Is this in Tyler, TX?
$C: Omg
$C: R/NotMyJob (but in the most complimentary way possible, this is fucking awesome)
$C: The one with the guitar has a mustache too!
$C: This is like something out of John Dies at the End.
$C: There's also Chino Bandito in Phoenix where they have sombrero pandas all over the restaurant.

$C: And a wig!
$C: Dedicated to your stereotype lol
$C: The cactus makes it really convincing 
$C: The inspiration for Desiigner's new part 2 hit. 

$C: Now it's like Day of the Dead art with fat-ass skeletons.
$C: adaption at its finest! 
$C: Work smart, not hard
$C: Some person who is neither Chinese nor Mexican will complain about "offensive cultural something or other," and this will be gone soon. 
$C: Reminds me of a Pho place that did the inverse with a Taco Bell and it was amazing too. Such good food and cheap. Taco Pho was the best; cheap, good, and always packed.
$C: "Yo soy Fiesta!"
$C: This is adorable.
$C: Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.
$C: Can you buy panda fur so you can do a Leonardo DiCaprio from The Revenant?
$C: I wonder if they'll make a lo mein burrito
$C: Reminds me of a running gag on that old sitcom Night Court; there was this restaurant they'd go to an every time they went there it would be a totally different theme and they'd just throw some token decor over the old stuff.
$C: Work smarter, not harder.
$C: This made me laugh out loud
$C: That's kinda adorable
$C: If you go to Mexicali, you'll see a bunch of Chinese-Mexican hybrid restaurants, it's strange.
$C: I‚Äôve got broads in Mazatlanta
Tacos, Burritos and Fanta
$C: So the mustaches were already there?
$C: U/bombaskos. Bless you for posting this. This post has legs!
$C: And tacos, hair on the "girl", some Mariachi instrument, chili peppers in the tree, cacti spread about

But yeah just sombreros I guess
$C: Just a little Piece of Trivia on MeÃÅxico and Pandas: 

M√©xico has the only two Pandas in Latin America: Shuan Shuan and Xin Xin.
Shuan Shuan is 30 years old, Xin Xin is 27 years old.

Also, the Chapultepec zoo was the first institution that breed Pandas in captivity outside of China.

$C: Is that Chino Bandidos?!
$C: Lol! This is awesome!
$C: Brilliant
$C: dat Panda stash with teenie violini
$C: Bear-down for midterms!!!
$C: Fongs Pizza in Des Moines did this as well, except instead of redecorating they just kept everything the same for the most part. Tons of old Chinese cigarette posters and a crab rangoon pizza that is very famous locally. 
$C: If I‚Äôm not mistaken this is a hole in the wall joint in Arizona and it‚Äôs a Mexican Chinese infused restaurant called Chino Bandinos. 
$C: ¬øCuantos me entienden? Jaja
$C: I once ate at this pizza joint in Alaska called "COAST" but the T was huge on the [sign.](https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/b2O15khLU36Qi27kYbc2dA/348s.jpg)

I was assured that it was because it used to be a Tacos place and they didn't want to buy new letters
$C: I'm fairly certain the pandas werent there. Otherwise you'd have some weird proportions in the painting with the pandas and the landscape. 
$C: I wonder how a mexican-chinese fusion cuisine would taste like.
$C: r/mildlyinfuriating 
$C: Everytime someone points out something new on the mural, I scroll up to see small details I overlooked.
$C:  you should march back in there and suggest that they upgrade to day of the dead pandas
$C: This is great!
$C: It's like a reverse They China Food restaurant from John Dies at the End.
$C: Chino bandito.

$C: This should definitely be on r/funny
$C: Mexican efficiency 
$C: I Havent read any comments, just laughed at the comedy values of this painting :D BUT! Are there any people getting offended by this? If your read this and are offended by it, could you then please explain me why? Im just very curious. 
$C: There‚Äôs a Chinese restaurant where I live. Used to be an Italian restaurant, has two statues of waiters holding trays of spaghetti and meatballs out front. They just left em 
$C: Am I really the only one?! 
$C: Racist AF - in both directions. It‚Äôs amazing 
$C: There is a place in the greater Phoenix area that takes this a step further. I present to you... [Chino Bandido](http://chinobandido.com/) . 
$C: Is that Chino Banditos in Phoenix?
$C: Someone go get a hi-res photo so I can have a new background for my desktop plz. 
$C: Someone go get a hi-res photo so I can have a new background for my desktop plz. 
$C: Must find and eat here.
$C: This is more than just mildly interesting.
$C: Aguila in Des Moines, Iowa?
$C: El Bamboo
$C: I hope it gets bought out by an Italian restaurant and they add chianti and spaghetti to the mural. 
$C: haha, awesome. One of the pandas is also eating what looks like two tacos
. 
$C: The panda with the taco is the best part.
$C: That takes some huevos.
$C: If that restaurant isn't named "La China Poblana", I'll be very disappointed.
$C: Mexican Chinese could be a good food combo'
$C: el fusi√≥n
$C: Banda! Banda! Banda!
$C: Build the Great Wall Of China, that'll keep those 'bad hombre's' out.
$C: I like it, it's effective and environmentally friendly.
$C: They should serve fusion food 
$C: Some college kids have been triggered by this...
$C: Someone, somewhere, thinks this is racist. 
$C: This sub has been really shit lately, with pictures of odometers and stuff that isn't interesting at all. This really qualifies, good post.
$C: hey
$C: Lmao, sure copy my work just change it a little ok
$C: Business must be virtually non-existent if a Chinese restaurant went out of business. 
$C: I love their little mustaches 
$C: They should have given the female panda the Frida Kahlo eyebrow treatment
$C: I donno man, that pretty festive and awesome.
$C: There‚Äôs one near me, ‚ÄúItalian & Mexican‚Äù. Probably the only one on the planet.
$C: mildly hilarious
$C: That... that is actually amazing

$C: Were the long braids Chinese or Mexican?  

Somehow I feel that I simply must know the answer to this.
$C: Sucks they only have tacos on the other side of the river. 
$C: The braid tails on that girl panda makes this really accurate 

$C: You forgot the taco in the left pandas hand.
$C: Cute
$C: 'MERICA!
$C: That is so cheap xD
$C: This. is. Awesome.
$C: There's a restaurant in Forsyth, MO called Chinese Mexican burrito, this would be great for them! 
$C: A creation greater than the sum of both cultural contributions taken individually. 

AMERICA. FUCK YEAH.
$C: Some ponchos would have been nice too
$C: I love this thread!! Yo amo esto cuerda!!

$C: In New Haven, there's a Mexican restaurant called Fresh Taco. Everything about it the design looks like your typical Chinese restaurant. Not to mention, all the staff were Chinese people. They make decent burritos, though. 
$C: I like how the Summer Shack in Cambridge MA converted the old Aku-Aku Polynesian restaurant into a seafood restaurant.

They even kept the old island mural inside the restaurant.
$C: I.... can't stop laughing....
$C: Most awesome mural if i ever saw one üòäüòäüòä
$C: The girl panda with human hair is unsettling.
$C: There‚Äôs a place here in Phoenix that is Chinese-Mexican fusion. This would be perfect for that restaurant.

$C: ¬øPorque no los dos?
$C: Has that wall been built yet? 
$C: Welcome to Obama's America
$C: We had a combination mex/Chinese restaurant near us a few years ago called Pancho Panda, it had pretty much the same decor.
$C: "In this restaurant, it is Chinco de Mayo!"
$C: I bet the cooks are the same people. lol 
$C: I missed the karma. I'm a horrible Karma whore he.
$C: Its like They China Food in reverse.
$C: I'd go there just for these cute pandas!
$C: love the panda eating a taco XD
$C: Panda appropriation, ooh I'm outraged
$C: one of the coolest things I've ever seen...should absolutely be on
 /r/Frugal 
$C: When you find answers to test questions and change them slightly during an exam. 
$C: There is something deeply American about this.
$C: Somewhere around where I live there is a sushi place that used to be a cowboy themed restaurant. Instead of changing their mural they painted sushi over the hotdogs the Cowboys were roasting. It was honestly the silliest thing.
$C: What's the least racist animal?


 A panda wearing a sombrero. Black, White, Asian and Mexican
$C: ÈÄôÊòØÊá∂ÊÉ∞ÁöÑ
$C: There's a Chinese/Mexican combination restaurant out here that has a Mexican Panda Mascot. It's called Chino Bandido's 
$C: And gave then tacos!
$C: Title overlooks the most important change, a panda eating a taco.
$C: One of them is eating a taco! Pure genius.
$C: We have a sushi/hibachi place in my town that used to be a tex mex place. All their booth seating has long horn cattle imagry.
$C: Genius. That's all that is.

$C: And one has tacos also
$C: I need the panda eating the taco on a Tshirt. 
$C: When life gives you pandas....
$C: I dunno, something tells me the chinese didn‚Äôt paint the cactus on there.
$C: I‚Äôm curious to learn where this is located as in my city there is a restaurant with the same pandas wearing sombreros only it‚Äôs a Chinese-Mexican fusion restaurant. They any have a five foot tall statue of these little guys.
$C: What‚Äôs the name of the restaurant? Pandibertos?
$C: Me too
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôd do,makes sence
$C: That's so weird. I was just wondering what the strangest crossover accent would be and settled on Chinese person with Mexican accent.

This fits perfectly.
$C: Something about this makes me so happy.
$C: Kinda reminds me of the Mitch Hedberg joke about Pringles and tennis balls...
$C: Is this Chino Bandidos in PHX? - different back story, same pandas. 
$C: Mine did something similar.  They decorated the dragons and other stuff and slowly over time at night would remove and plaster over things.   It took years and was actually a pretty neat side show, each time you'd go in something changed.

One of the waiters later told me "oh the dragons are all at my house".
$C: Mexican ingenuity! 
$C: panda panda panda panda panda
$C: In Des Moines Iowa there is a pizza place that is in an old Chinese restaurant. They kept all the Chinese decor and a lot of the things on the menu our odd fusions of Chinese and Italian stuff. Some examples are crab rangoon Pizza and the mozzarella sticks are wrapped in wonton wrappers instead of the typical breading.
$C: Panderos are what we call them in our days
$C: Los Pandejos 
$C: What about the She-Panda with long hair?
$C: They gave the panda on the left a taco to eat 
$C: This is actually pretty cool, I dig it. 
$C: Not Chino banditos?
 
 
$C: This is amazing 
$C: I want this framed and put up on my wall
$C: Wasn't this place by chance, was it?

$C: When I was a kid we used to go to a restaurant in Austin called Cocina del Sur that had some excellent Tex-Mex from what I remember, but they also had a few Chinese dishes if you knew to ask for them. The family had run an excellent Chinese food restaurant called Lung‚Äôs. I wasn‚Äôt around when Lung‚Äôs closed and not at all old enough to venture out of my food comfort zone to try their Chinese food, so I missed out. Still it is a neat memory. 

Cocina del Sur is also where Jimmy Buffet got the idea to write Margaritaville. Apparently, they had truly inspirational margaritas. 

It only could have been better if they‚Äôd had a mural of pandas wearing sombreros!
$C: TIL pandas eat tacos 
$C: Lazy but stylish.
$C: This reminds me of a restaurant in North Phoenix named Chino Bandido, a Mexican-Chinese-Jamaican mix menu'ed place. Best damn burritos I've had.
$C: I hope the next company does the same but adds their flair to the mural.
$C: Honestly the most Mexican you can do.  
$C: I guess they added those cactuses too
$C: Hope they put more care into the food.
$C: r/mildlyhilarious
$C: They Mexico Food!
$C: Brilliant marketing, well done Se√±or Panda

$C: Classique my friend great find ((( : "
$C: "Ay jue, there's those black and white bears on the wall."
"Put some sombreros on those fuckers."
"Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyye."
$C: There was a Mexican restaurant that took over an old A&W and they didn‚Äôt repaint the murals either. All they did was replace the food the car hops were serving with nachos. This is much, *much*, better. 
$C: This reminds me of Chico and Chang's in Atlanta. Being able to get a mu shu pork burrito delivered at 4am is the Pinnacle of human acheivement.
$C: There is a Noodle World in Alhambra, CA that used to be a Bob's Big Boy and they never remodeled after taking over the building. There is still a giant BBB statue in the lobby and everything is red and white checkered.
$C: There is a chinese/Mexican restaurant in Phoenix called Chino Bandido that has a panda in a sombrero. They serve a fusion that is amazing. They even had it on diners, drive-ins, and dives. The best part is the cookies that comes with your meal. 
$C: haha i love this
$C: There‚Äôs a place in Oakland called Comida Panda, and I have no clue weather it‚Äôs Chinese food or Mexican. 
$C: Chino Bandito

$C: This is my kind of restaurant! 
$C: Asian fusion
$C: what about the chili peppers!
$C: I'm confident in saying that there probably hasn't been another Mexican restaurant that has ever had a painting with pandas in sombreros in it. 
$C:  This reminds me of Chino Bandido in Phoenix! Mexican-Chinese fusion. Orange Chicken Burrito ftw!
$C: well this is the best shit I've seen all day
$C: Sure not Trump's favorite restaurant 
$C: This reminds me of We Bare Bears!
$C: Where the hell are we?
$C: The panda on the left eating a taco is a nice touch.
$C: Genius 
$C: That‚Äôs hardcore they should send a post card to trump 
$C: Everyone is coming up with great jokes and all I can think of is Juandas...
$C: ctrl+f they china food

$C: I can't tell if some of the pandas noses look like mustaches, or if some of the pandas actually have added mustaches

$C: Missed opportunity - Margarita River 
$C: Good idea, that mural kicks ass. Way better to add to it than destroy it
$C: Lazy, cheap and creative? Yup, checks out.
$C: China poblana
$C: So the panda eating the taco was on it before
$C: Is that a panda with a mustache holding a guitar? 
$C: There's even Panda Kahlo up in the tree.
$C: Asian, black, white and Latino
$C: Yesssss
$C: Look at those two pandas that crossed the river! #buildawall
$C: Panda - one of the greatest cultural melting pot icons ever. Black, white and Asian
$C: A couple of them even have gaucho mustaches
$C: Reuse Recycle 
$C: Aw, look at the silly chupacabras.
$C: The taco
$C: ‚ÄòWildly Interesting‚Äô
$C: Hey this is in my city! Harrisonburg va, glad to see us getting on the map. 
$C: I know this place! The Chinese restaurant used to have a deep fried sushi in honor of Ken Jeong's character in community called the Chong roll and it was amazing. They would bring it to you and ring a Chinese chime in celebration, which was kind of a treat. Once they switched to a Mexican restaurant the new owners kind of kept the tradition alive by making a chimichanga which is a friend burrito and named it after famous comedian Tommy Chong, and it was also great! They served it while ringing a chime and excitedly exclaimed, "Enjoy your Chimingchangchong!"
$C: Hey now a couple of them have mustaches as well. Haha 
$C: Hahahaha

$C: Cultural appropriation pandas...
$C: Mexican ingenuity!
$C: And fed one a taco
$C: We've got bamboo taquitos 
$C: Somewhere, some Salon blogger is very unhappy
$C: There is a place here in South Florida that used to be an Italian restaurant with several old roman sculptures outside.  When it was bought and converted to a Mexican place, they painted the statues and put sombreros and holsters on them to make them look like banditos.  It makes me laugh every time I go there.
$C: Harrisonburg Represent!!!!

$C: Or it was a Mexican restaurant and the Chinese restaurant added pandas. ü§î
$C: Hey, why not?
$C: https://i.imgur.com/dVDJiez.gif
$C: They added some hot peppers in the trees and a tacos too!

$C: Instead of painting over the mural they did exactly that. 
$C: Big fan of the Frida Kahlo panda
$C: I want to see more Chinese-Mexican folk art now
$C: And [this](https://m.discoverlosangeles.com/sites/default/files/styles/mobile_poi_detail/public/Restaurants/guelaguetza-exterior.jpg) Mexican restaurant also used to be a Chinese restaurant. As you can see, they didn‚Äôt bother redesigning the place. My guess is they‚Äôre just being cheap, not creative.
$C: Awesome 
$C: There are also Nepal‚Äôs on the ground - Mexico‚Äôs national plant. It‚Äôs on the flag guys!

$C: Don‚Äôt forget them little moustaches! Top quality!
$C: Double the racist stigma AMIRIGHT....or does not only apply selectively per your political beliefs? Lol...
$C: Cultural. appropriations!!!! 
$C: A really close friend of mine lives up in Harrisonburg and has sent me this pic of the mural everytime they go to this restaurant. I find it very intriguing and hilarious and would love to actually go here one of these days.

$C: Best of both worlds. All you can eat Mexican buffet

$C: Dey terk er jerbs
$C: Haha, I have a restaurant next to me that was at one time a very old school Italian restaurant in the 1960s, then a Greek restaurant in the 1970s, a disco at one point in time, and now an Indian/Chinese fusion place. It's the most bizarre looking place you've ever eaten at. 

It was odd enough to be featured in an episode of 30 Rock (although I forgot the plot line why they were there)
$C: You never know when you didn't know you needed something until you see it.

$C: The five spice in my hometown used to be a Backyard Burger so they just painted it purple and put what looks like saucepans over the little flames on the side of the buildings to just make it look like a wok. 

I'll have to take a picture of it sometime üòÇ
$C: how do you know they painted over it? maybe the last owners were half mexican and chinese
$C: This is one of the cutest things I have ever seen
$C: Were the pigtails on the girl panda before or after the change?
$C: Those are a buch of Pandeho's :P

$C: Panditos
$C: That‚Äôs racist!
$C: Does this count as cultural appropriation? 
$C: 4hours and already >100k upvotes? At this pace this is easily going to be the most upvoted post ever!
$C: Ah! I worked a  Mexican restaurant that used to be a Greek restaurant! The took all the paintings of the gods and added mustaches! So funny! I had a pic on my old droid and no one else got why it was so funny to me!! 
$C: I love how the panda by the tree has a guitar and a moustache to complement the sombrero
$C: This is my favorite thing to come across on reddit so far. Photo. Story. Comments. Everything. 
$C: Supporting the classic stereotype Mexicans are lazy nice job internet!
$C: cant wait until it turns into a Italian joint and they paint pizzas in their paws 
$C: Nice full blood moon in the background too
$C: At my local mall they have pelicans painted on the walls, for Christmas they just put santa hat stickers on them as Christmas decoration.
$C: It‚Äôs great because it works
$C: Jaja, Chingon.

$C: Racism.
$C: Pretty sure those are raccoons
$C: Teaser to Kung Fu Panda 4? 
$C: That is quite cool.
$C: They have created a masterpiece.
$C: Mix the food too, taco's with roasted pork! :-)
$C: They improved the painting by about 500% by doing this.
$C: I bet this place has fucking good food.

There's a Mexican place near me that used to be an Italian place.  They never bothered to get rid of any of the artwork or the bottles of olives and such.  They kept all the decorations but they painted the walls bright orange.  They make a fucking good taco.
$C: The perfect amount of effort! Love those pandas even more 
$C: And that is totally one of those Mexican trees. I'm not sure about this..
$C: Address so I can go here to dine, please
$C: *culture appropriation frieks triggered*
$C: I hope this is a portal in Ingress.
$C: Mex restaurant here was a chinese restaurant. "Entrance" decal on the front door is in chinese english letter font.
$C: They are going to get a lot of business from this one post alone. 
$C: Do they have stir fry tacos? That would be amazing.
$C: OP where is this place? I wanna go!
$C: Tijuana actually has really good Chinese food 
$C: I would love to visit the resturant and take a selfie
$C: This is exactly the sort of think I expect from cheeky Mexicanos. 
$C: Âæà bien
$C: 4 hours after I see this, I am back and wondering what kind of wall this is. It looks like it's actually a mixture of painted blinds, cardboard props (see the shadows from the trees), and painted walls? Any other bored internet detectives come to similar conclusions?
$C: Brilliant actually
$C: Is this in Harrisonburg VA? They have one of these there as well.
$C: how strange we dont even use sombreros in MX, i have not seen one in a few years already
$C: Reminds me of a Mitch Hedberg joke...  Must be a laid back company
$C: The panda eating a fish taco
$C: Amazing. This reminds me of an Indian buffet nearby that has Mexican placemats detailing spellings of different Spanish words. Come to think of it they also had art hung up of the Eiffel Tower too, so I'm not sure exactly what was going on with the theming of that place
$C: This is wonderful
$C: I love it
$C: Chino Latino!
$C: I want to put it all over my room!
$C: The more I stare, the more I notice. They could just keep adding through the years. 
$C: This should be in r/veryinteresting 
$C: Used to have a place around here called Poncho Panda with paintings like that. Was the only Chinese Mexican buffet I've ever seen. Applied one time and asked if I could be the poncho panda. They told me no.
$C: The lack of damns given is impressive.

$C: I've been here! Rocktown!
$C: React, adapt, improvise!!!
$C: Ive been to a restaurant like that but instead of replacing things they just integrated everything into the menu. The restaurant is now chinese and mexican. 
$C: .^ENHANCED
$C: Genius!
$C: I don‚Äôt see race
$C: And they're just one step away from unleashing Chinese-Mexican fusion cuisine upon us all!

$C: This is probably the best thing I've seen all day
$C: Chino Bandito?
$C: Lmao is he eating a taco bahahhaa
$C: So when I was a kid there was a restaurant in Wichita Kansas called Carlos and Wong...a Mexican / Chinese place....under the name it was referred to as Westawaunt....this would have worked perfectly there.
$C: *gasp* Cultural appropriation!
$C: Yo soy una panda tristeeee...
$C: That looks like Chino Bandido tbh
$C: [spicy!](https://youtu.be/Vbnv37AHpvc)
$C: Is this cultural appropriation?
$C: This reminds me of the cover of Music From Big Pink
$C: Rolf owners of the restaurant are really badass xD
$C: I know that restaurant! I grew up in that town.
$C: üòÖ
$C: I can bet you the owners are still chinese
$C: The cacti were a nice little detail.
$C: Yo, I live in the same city! El Sol is üî• 
$C: Innovative üòÇ
$C: Local AZ Mexican-Asian mashup restaurant [Chino-Bandino](http://chinobandido.com/) says hello. 
$C: There is a good Mexican Chinese fusion restaurant in Arizona called Chino Bandido. The food is sooooo delicious!

[Chino Bandido](http://chinobandido.com) 

$C: We name that a "mexicanada" a smart and simple solution.
$C: They should keep going with it , piece by piece 
$C: Improvise. Adapt. Overcome
$C: Where is this? I have looked you several of the restaurants but none are right, thanks all ‚ò∫Ô∏è
$C: Ingenieria mexicana alv compa.
$C: Was it "Panda Express".
$C: This is great. Exactly what I would do. High interest. Low effort.
$C: It still looks more Chinese than Mexican though 
$C: And braids 
$C: Ingenious! 
$C: I've been there
$C: Shut up and take my money.
$C: Chino Bandidos?
$C: This pleases me.
$C: Not just 
$C: lol
$C: R/outrun
$C: oh hi harrisonburg
$C: now that's fusion cuisine
$C: Que vergas.. 138k hmm vatos
$C: I love ah-mell-ee-kuh.
$C: ¬°Ole!
$C: A Lebanese restaurant near me called Cedar House closed and a Chinese place bought it. I didn't even notice for a bit because they only took down the "e ar" from the sign and called themselves "C D   HOUSE"
$C: New ownership? Or same people
$C: I could have sworn this mural was in a restaurant in the city I went to university, Tyler, TX. Name of the restaurant was called Pancho Panda. It had a menu that had both Chinese food and Mexican food. Look it up... The logo of the place was a guy in a pancho and sombrero riding a panda.
$C: This reminds me of Chino Bandido in Phoenix! It's actually a Chinese/Mexican place and has similar art work üòÇ
$C: I like to think that after the last brush stroke, they stood back, put their hands on their waist, and let out a goofy chuckle.
$C: And yet somehow it all works. Bravo... I mean, √Åndale, √Åndale!
$C: That bear is eating üåÆ!
$C: r/repaintings
$C: um..... uh.... USA!!! USA!!!!
$C: amazing.
$C: El sol!!!!! Best Menudo soup I've ever had!!!
$C: Where's "local" because Phoenix has a resturaunt that is a mix of Mexican and Chinese.
$C: Their noses look like little mustachios ^_^
$C: ‚ÄúEl Panda Express‚Äù
$C: Almost as cool as Chino Bandidos logo
$C: I want to eat there now!
$C: This post had to have been an unexpected karma jackpot for OP. I could reddit 1000 years and never see that high of a post. 
$C: Up cycling 
$C: That Mexican improviastion at work !
$C: This is awesome!
$C: What a painting!!!!!!!!!!!!
$C:  A R T !
$C: My God, they even put mustaches on a few of the pandas.
$C: [?](https://i.imgur.com/Hr7xOFn.gif)
$C: That‚Äôs the type of place that has insanely good food. Low brow Mexican is the best 
$C: Donde?!!! Pls tell
$C: The restaurant Summershack in Cambridge, MA did something similar.   It‚Äôs a seafood place that went in where a tiki bar had been for a long time.  They kept the giant Moai by the door, and just repainted it to look like a fisherman in a rain slicker.
$C: We have a local restaurant that servers both 
$C: This is the greatest thing I've ever seen
$C: Fun fact: the direct translation of sombrero into English is hat. If you were in Spain, you could call every kind of hat a sombrero.
$C: Hopefully the next restaurant follows suit.
$C: Mexican Chinese would make a great fusion.
$C: Mexicans.
$C: Are the owners from Monterrey, N.L. In Mexico? (people in that city are known for being stingy) - stereotype, I know 
$C: They probably didn't even need to switch out the cooks.
$C: There was a smorgasbord restaurant in West L.A. called ‚ÄúThe Viking‚Äôs table‚Äù that had a mural of a helmeted Viking on the side. It became a Chinese restaurant and they repainted the Viking‚Äôs eyes to make him appear Chinese.
$C: There is a restaurant in Phoenix called [Chino Bandito](http://chinobandido.com/) They have a statue of a panda with a sombrero. It's chinese mexican fusion 
$C: Congratulations you are now #1 All time OP!
$C: What is the name of this restaurant?
$C: And gave Spanish names to all their waiters: Jose Chang, Pedro Wang, etc.
$C: Honestly without Chinese, Mexican or Indian food I would've died of hunger as European food is utter shit.
$C: Yeah, but do you really care? Mexican pandas are much cuter than I thought they would be
$C: I'm the panda gently nomming on a taco by the riverside
$C:  
$C: How is this one of the most upvoted things off the day?!? For god sakes where is Jah?!?
$C: rip Chito Banditos 
$C: Next up, Hipster Bar and now, the pandas are on unicycles.
$C: I would patron this place for sure. 
$C: This is awesome! 
$C: That happened in my town and too. The usual chinese food menu ( large pictures of the food on lot. Up plastic. They just change the words and pictures lol   basic example of what I mean 
https://goo.gl/images/CZVEE6
(edited to include image) 
$C: Mexico is the only other country in the world to outright own their pandas instead of leased ones like every other zoo outside of China 
$C: Really? No one is gonna bring up They China Food from *John Dies At The End*?
$C: A place on college blvd used to have this mural in Kansas 
$C: Used to go to a tapas restaurant that's now a Thai; all they did was put some Thai flags on the massive Spanish mosaic they had lol
$C: And that prick of a president says Mexicans have nothing to offer. This is more innovative than anything that asshole has ever done. 
$C: Panzteca!
$C: actually before the continents split, Mexico was the safe haven for all pandas... not many people know that.  And they called it Mexico back then too. 
$C: That's cute
$C: This is someone who knows how to make the best of a bad situation. 
$C: Is that chitobandito
$C: The panda on the left has a taco
$C: There is no secret ingredient
$C: John Dies at the End, anyone?
$C: It's beautiful
$C: Plus 3 pandas have successfully crossed the Rio Grande! 
$C: Aaaaand it‚Äôs the most upvoted thing on mildly interesting 
$C: I've seen similar with a Japanese restaurant turned Mexican. They themed up the tatami booths, little bridge and stream. Should've taken photos.

$C: My hometown's Mexican restaurant didn't do anything this beat, but when they moved into the ten-year-vacant Pizza Hut building they kept the Hut roof intact. 
$C: My people ‚ù§Ô∏è
$C: How creative! Ol√© 
$C: There used to be a restaurant in my city called Wok-a-mole. It was a Chinese-Mexican food buffet. 
$C: Who's ever heard of a Chinese resturaunt closing?
$C: this guy is on the row for the the most up voted picture? 
$C: And the nopales man!
$C: Tequila river 
$C: There is a place in Phoenix, Arizona called Chino Bandido that uses similar images! It‚Äôs a Mexican/Chinese blend restaurant that has some of the best food I have ever had. http://chinobandido.com/ 
$C: And gave them taco's.
$C: Isn't this cultural appropriation? These images belong to an abstract group of people called the "Chinese" and this is "problematic"
$C: If anyone is ever in Phoenix, Az you have to check out Chino Banditos! It's a combination Chinese and Mexican food place and this really reminds me of it!
$C: In before mods lock it because free discussion is too hard.
$C: Would love to hear the conversation of the first teens on lsd to sit at the table next to this
$C: What if it was native american themed and the restaurant put top hats on the figures. Would there be a double standard?
$C: This is actually freaking cute al hell 
$C: Gz on top post of all time
$C: That would be chino bandido right?
$C: Is this by any chance at the old super panda that they turned into the Mexican grill in Greensburg, PA? 
$C: No.
$C: The patterns don‚Äôt look right. These are just bears in white jumpsuit 
$C: This is el Sol in Harrisonburg, VA! I live there!!!!!!!!
$C: They are all trying to woo the same panda-rita
$C: Did they get permission from the original muralist?
$C: There's a Chinese fast food in east la (owned by asians). Their logo is a Chinese guy with chinky eyes, a sombrero, and a mustache. Pretty similar to the Cha Cha Chili korean/Mexican fusion chain
$C: This is amazing.
$C: Which one is the kid rock climbing on the basketball shooting game at the local pizza pueblo
$C: I wonder if the old owners are happy they kept the painting or upset they changed it like that. 
$C: Aaaand this is the sub‚Äôs top post of all time
$C: Juan: Roberto! What should we do about this painting? It's too nice to paint over. 

Roberto: Let's put chiles in the trees, give them sombreros, give one a taco and another a guitar while wearing a mustache.

Juan: ¬°Excelente!
$C: I love this so much
$C: Address or this doesn‚Äôt exist.

Kung pao quesadillas or GTFO
$C: Do pandas really eat tacos?
$C: /r/NotFoolingAnybody
$C: Dude this is amazing.  Save money and super neat!  I bet it attracts a lot of photos and shit lol
$C: This is how I want to live my life.
$C: Even the female panda has chola eyebrows
$C: There is a Thai place in Tucson, AZ that has a southwestern desert mural with bufdhist temples painted over it.  Char Thai.
$C: Isnt this Chino Bandido? Its a legit restaurant last time I checked. It is asian mexican fusion with a hint of Jamaican.
$C: This is a beauty. 
$C: Cultural appropriation, or cultural apandaration?
$C: And added s taco 
$C: La panda de Guadalupe 
$C: That's pure genius right there
$C: Well naturally.
$C: very cool.
$C: Can someone please draw a nacho boat sailing by the one in the back?
$C: I‚Äôve seen Chinese men cooking Mexican food, and Mexican women cooking Chinese food. But Mexican Pandas picking tree top Chiles? Now I‚Äôve seen everything. 
$C: The restaurant is sold and serves Arabic cuisine. Sombrero wearing pandas sitting on flying carpets . Add chickpea bushes (if they come in bushes) and put stong little coffees nearby. 
$C: The panda in the middle seems to be really confused about the cactus.
$C: "That's racist!" In 5, 4, 3 ,2...
$C: the title is actually wrong. i grew up going to this place it is called "Chito Bandido" in Arizona.

http://chinobandido.com/

it is a great place to eat with a great history in the area!

it's like mexican meats served chinese style. there is a bunch of silly and funny pandas with sombreros on and even when i was a kid there was one a giant plastic one sitting in the place.

yum!

edit: i think the painting is done custom for the place since it has a local mountain range in the background with a classic AZ sunset. must be the Superstition mountains.

$C: most economical rennovation
$C: There is a Mexican restaurant near me that used to be a Burger King. They had a playground where they put a Sombrero on the Burger dude and turned one of the other characters into a chicken and painted all of the equipment yellow and red. They tore down the playground a couple of years ago to put in a patio so no pic.
$C: More lile r/notmyjob
$C: This post just gave me the idea to wrap my general Tso's chicken & rice in a Tortilla. 
$C: It's perfect. Exactly how I picture them in the wild
$C: Is this cultural appropriation? 
$C: And I believe the panda is eating a taco! 
$C: what used to be a roman temple was often transformed into christian church when the circumstances changed. The Hagia Sofia bazylika became a mosque. an australian city has a church and synagogue , both transformed into nightclubs - so ...nothing gets waisted
$C: I can't wait for a different culture to take over this place and add their own little details to the mural
$C: Cost saving ;v
$C: I worked at a Chinese restaurant where they did this with New Orleans. It was a Cajun restaurant originally. All over the restaurant, they had murals that were clearly new Orleans- they just painted over the street signs with Chinese characters.
$C: r/funny
$C: I worked in Mexico City for 14 years. Its national zoo was one of the of the first foreign zoos to get a panda from China> The zoo is set in the middle of Chapultepec Park, which is mobbed on weekends by families, with a trip to see the panda almost mandatory.

So, pandas really are part of modern Mexican culture today. Wise move by new owners.
$C: They should make a new kind of food; ChinaMex!  Taco won-tons would be awesome.


$C: how lazy
$C: No Chinese avocado?
$C: At least they made an effort. One of my local sushi places has giant murals of Santorini courtesy of the Greek restaurant that held the location before them. 
$C: If they opened a restaurant called "Taco-Pagoda" in my town, it would be my new place to eat. 

Imagine Mu-shu burritos, lemon-chicken flautas. Carne-Asada chow-mein. 


$C: But the painting style is not Chinese style. It looks more like Japanese style. So Chinese just added some pandas on Japanese landscape painting
$C: /r/NotFoolingAnybody
$C: but muh cultural appropriation!!!
$C: My fiance burst out laughing and said she hopes it's the image for a pokestop

- is there no way to insert an image in the Reddit android app?
$C: The thriftyness of small Mexican restaurants never ceases to amaze me.

Do some of the pandas have mustaches haha.
$C: This is funny hehe
$C: The panda on the right is muy Bonita 
$C: Someone please put me in my place if needed, but is every single taco store in Brooklyn run by Chinese people, or am I just imagining.
$C: Pandilleros
$C: So much attention to detail. They added chillies to the trees, mustaches, and tacos. I wonder if they use cat meat for their tacos?
$C: Hahaha there's a nopal hahahaha
$C: This is pretty awesome 
$C: Wow, Chino Bandido is getting more free advertising out of this than the restaurant with this mural. It is that good tho.
$C: Oh my thats perfect.
$C: Savage
$C: Mexican Restaurant Art is ni hao bueno.
$C: I need this full scale over my bed
$C: I think this is the first time cultural appropriation is an apt term!
$C: they‚Äôre olmec pandas.
$C: shit like this makes me really think that people can actually do the 'philosophical unicorn' thing and be perfect. 

  this is perfect.
$C: Love the tacos in the pandas hands too!
$C: Jose, como propone arreglar el mural?

Y no ve Chon?
$C: The Chinese place by my house used to be Mexican. It has beaches and stuff painted on the walls, all tropical. They covered the walls in paper lanterns and put a big goldfish tank in front of an ocean view to try and bring it in.... but it still looks distinctly weird until you realize it used to be a Mexican restaurant haha.
$C: When laziness and creativity combine, beautiful things can emerge from it. 
$C: The one with the taco is my favorite.
$C: They don‚Äôt even have tacos in China. 
$C: They missed an opportunity not connecting those eye brows on the right most panda. Panda Kahlo. 
$C: Ni hao, Se√±or
$C: They also turned the bamboo the far-left panda‚Äôs eating into a taco.
$C: Fuck it eh!
$C: This is beyond mildly interesting 
$C: That's what you call a cheap fix.
$C: they‚Äôre havin way more fun now
$C: This makes me very happy. 
$C: This is what you get when the owner is on budget yet the art team is talented af. 
$C: This is beautiful! 
$C: Bro I'm fucking dead üòÇ this is fucken Mexican af I love it 
$C: You won the upvote lottery!

$C: Êàë
$C: Let's not forget they're eating nopales and tacos.

$C: Seems legit.
$C: There was a Chinese buffet in the town I used to work in that very clearly used to be a Mexican restaurant.  The outside was painted bright orange and yellow.
$C: I saw this whilst scrolling and was like, "...wait, I know this place!"

Sup RW!
$C: Most Mexican thing to do!!! We don‚Äôt throw anything away! 
$C: There used to be this place where my dad lived that was an Asian and Mexican restaurant called Pancho Panda that had art similar to this. Sadly this mediocre restaurant is closed so there‚Äôs no more pandas in poncho murals for me. 
$C: Put me in the screenshot
$C: Improvise. Adapt. Overcome. 
$C: That's so funny lmfao
$C: The panda on the left is eating a taco! 
$C: How much is a panda meat burrito? 
$C: Is this restaurant located in opposite-day [Undisclosed]?
$C: Wow! A post on my hometown. Who would have thunk it?! This place is great. My wife and I try to eat here when we visit.  The food is great and everyone is so friendly.  My wife has Celiac's disease and they go out of their way to make sure her meal is gluten free.  They even make us fresh tortilla chips.
$C: And the Pandarita with braids!!! 
$C: My town has a Mexican buffet restaurant that is run by Asians.  It has allot of stuff that a Asian buffet would have.  
$C: cultural apandaration 

$C: This is an awesome tradition. When the Mexican place ever turns over I hope it goes to a Thai place.

$C: Wonder if they took the same approach with their condiments? The sriracha rooster now has a sombrero and is trying to steal someone's job in America.
$C: [deleted]
$C: China and Mexico, BFFs confirmed. Sorry U.S., its not us..its DEFINITELY YOU.
$C: A former Mexican restaurant near me became a Middle Eastern restaurant.

There was a beautiful mural on all 4 walls of the place, so they just scribbled out all of the sombreros and crucifixes.

It looks super trashy and the food is shit though :(
$C: Wow! Two stereotypes combined into one mural....I hope for the owners sake, she is a Chinese-Mexican.  
$C: "Local Mexican restaurant that used to be a Chinese restaurant. Now a Chinese restaurant again, instead of painting over a mural, just put rice field hats over the sombreros over the pandas"

$C: [deleted]
$C: Is that cultural appropriation and that‚Äôs not allowed. 
$C: That's cultural appropriation and racist. Liberals should be ashamed 
$C: I think I'm on firm ground when I say that this is an act of appropriation: the use of traditional artistic elements from outside the tradition of the artist.[sub-1 "parallel thinking"]

But as we move further into the 21st century, and as the internet continues to propagate the meta-meme of globalization, we're going to have to continue to reinforce the attitude that appropriation is a good thing; that the act of appropriation further distinguishes the cultural heritages of various traditions through their sharing of commonalities; which, in this case appeals to how wonderful pandas are, and the relative liquidity of the food service industry. Furthermore... yeah I finished my pancakes and I have other stuff to do today.
$C: Low key racist 
$C: Sounds racist
$C: If nothing else, wetbacks are fucking resourceful 
$C: I work next to a Mexican restaurant and this is such a typical move from their playbook. 
$C: Racist. 
$C: Plagiarism
$C: Isn‚Äôt this cultural appropriation?
$C: That's racist
$C: Uhhhm stereotypical much???
$C: That's racist!
$C: White liberals were offended.
$C: It‚Äôs slightly racist but if the people who own the place are Mexican it‚Äôs ok
$C: I would not eat $1 tacos. 
$C: And the panda on the left is now eating a taco instead of bamboo while the one on the right is playing a Vihuela. 
$C: The guy who painted the sombreros clearly has the ability to paint a whole mural, but fuckit we makin' Mexican pandas
$C: And there are cacti growing.
$C: They are! I didn't even notice those till you pointed them out. 
$C: Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è I thought it was too üé®
$C: I didnt even notice that, at first
$C: i‚Äôm more curious to know what the bear on the left was eating before they drew a taco over it.
$C: Cacti too
$C: They even painted cactus in there...
$C: Also the cacti.
$C: I like the lady panda on the tree touch the best.
$C: those mountains should have been pyramids
$C: [The chilli panda](https://i.imgur.com/psXBHNM.jpg)
$C: are we going to ignore the fact that it has as desert landscape with some mountains like mexico, which is probably painted over a jungle, which is where the pandas live(d)
$C: And the left panda is munching on a taco
$C: Actually that region where pandas are from (Sichuan) is known for having too many spicy dishes.

I'm Mexican and my gf is from that region. I eat spicy compared to my European friends but my gf beats me!
$C: Not to mention the cactus.
$C: Actually, it *was* his job and he did it pretty well.


$C: Has anyone mentioned the braids on the panda in the tree? Lol
$C: I think those are red bamboo leaves. But I want to believe they're chilis!
$C: and the nopales. dont forget the nopales.
$C: Let‚Äôs just hope they didn‚Äôt apply this same logic in the kitchen area 
$C: The corn on the cob lefty is mowing down to is a nice touch as well. 
$C: I thought they were red carrots. Yes...in trees. 
$C: The mustache on the pandas, and the guitar..
$C: Yeah, it‚Äôs missing a wall though...

Either one will do. 
$C: Totally realistic.

$C: that‚Äôs a carrot tree dumbass smh
$C: Umm that looks like bamboo 
$C: It's a bamboo tree for crying out loud
$C: When it becomes an All-American restaurant, nothing will change.
$C: That would be hilarious! Then it become a German restaurant next so they add some lederhosen. 
$C: There is a Polish restaurant in Florida that used to be an Ancient Egyptian themed restaurant, they just draped a Polish Eagle Banner over the mummy.
$C: And when it becomes an Indian restaurant they'll just make the pandas a wee bit brown and introduce some cows. 
$C: *little bits*
$C: But when that happens, don't you toucha my spagett
$C: And some baguettes... 
$C: Pandito's

$C: I used to eat at Pancho Panda in Tyler Texas, they served both Mexican and Chinese. Also had sombrero wearing pandas on the menu and walls.


Their buffet was crap, but everything fresh from the kitchen was delicious!
Sadly they are no more.
$C: Someone email the owners this
$C: Pandito Express
$C: Is a Pandaderia 
$C: It‚Äôs Chino Bandino

$C: Glad to see fellow Arizonans reppin‚Äô the best Chinese-Mexican joint in the country.
$C: I'm surprised I had to scroll this far down to see this mentioned.

Also, I think I know where I'm going for dinner now...
$C: I actually clicked to see if anyone had mentioned Chino! 
$C: Thanks for the lunch sugestion , time to get some Jade Red Chicken.

$C: It sounds like a place to buy Mexican khakis
$C: I have a [shirt](https://imgur.com/a/KrED5) from here!
$C: Came here looking for this comment! My whole neighborhood came to Chino once a week when we were kids, awesome memories. The food there is so dang good.

I believe there are multiple locations in PHX too
$C: I fucking love that restaurant. 
$C: Chinos is my favorite restaurant!! Guy Fieri went there for his show too so you know it's good
$C: Literally was thinking of Chino Banditos. Nice
$C: Came here to say this. Although the one in my neck of the woods closed. 
$C: Love Chino Bandido. Definitely gonna have to go there this weekend. I live about 5 minutes away. It's awesome. 
$C: I also expected this to be related to Chino Bandoido. I love it there. Their chili relleno is out of this world.
$C: Where‚Äôs this? I must see it!
$C: Is it any good?  When my husband told me about it from his coworkers we both came to the conclusion it can be delicious awesome or horribly bad. 
$C: God I want a Jade Red Chicken Quesadilla so bad right now.
$C: I have a friend here in Phoenix - a loyal husband focused on his wife's happiness.   The one exception - CHINO !  She hates it, he doesn't care.   He defers to her on almost everything. But he won't budge on his love for a Chinese / Mexican fusion dive.
$C: I've eaten there on my aunt's recommendation... It was quite far from where we lived in AZ but it was surprisingly good and I didn't get food poisoning like I thought I would rofl!
$C: ...Damn it, why did I choose this week to start the keto diet again.
$C: Safe to say they‚Äôre going to have an influx of patrons this weekend, I know I‚Äôm definitely gonna pop over there! I could use some emerald chicken üòç AND THAT JERK RICE
$C: Also outside of phoenix is (was?) a chinese/mexican buffet. Gross as it sounds. 
$C: Soo good! The jade red chicken is fire!
$C: One Japanese restaurant in Santa Barbara used to have Japanese students as staff and cooks. When the staff was on vacation they would have Mexican cooks doing the public thing. Heavy make up around the eyes to make them look more Japanese...
$C: What are you waiting? You have free karma in that place, go get it!
$C: Be sure to buy them this [Mexican brand](https://super.walmart.com.mx/images/product-images/img_large/00750103045250L.jpg) of gummy bears

$C: I demand to be notified when this becomes reality.
$C: Your children are going to get the best food on the planet. 
$C: does your family hate him? generally speaking, it seems like mexicans hate chinese people. source: am chinese, grew up in los angeles. 
$C: You're Welcome
$C: You will give birth to the hardest working kids ever...
$C: That kid is going to have some delicious cuisine coming to him. I hope he learns about both of his cultures.
$C: Am in the same boat and definitely taking the idea as well.
$C: My dad is Chinese and my mom is Mexican. I‚Äôm excited for your future kids! I love being mixed and have never met anyone outside of my sister with the same combo. Definitely encourage your kids to embrace and express their mixed heritage!

$C: My condolences 
$C: Wow, how progressive! I am literally dying just imagining how this kids will look like! 

That is what we need to preserve the human race a mixing of every color until we all look alike. (Well, except for Jews. They are God's chosen people)

Also, it gave me the biggest real life chuckle. Today will not be topped. 
$C: How dare you.....you magnificent bastard
$C: I just got an idea for a Nacho Libre-Kung Fu Panda cross over! We‚Äôll save millions on casting!

$C: ¬°JAJA jaja! 
$C: Pandajos!

edit: ok u negative peeps! that's how my "pocha" tia says "pendejos" .  #pinchiojeteshijosdelarechingadamamones
$C: Pandajos
$C: ¬°Pandejos pendejos!
$C: Actually is "Pendejos".

Do you know what it means? It's quite offensive.
$C: This is actually really disturbing that this got gold because this is offensive. Almost even racist.
$C: El Sol in Harrisonburg, Va. They do an awesome $1 Taco Tuesday!
$C: The mustache on the panda serenading pandette is my favourite.
$C: You'd love the Chinese-Mexican fusion joint here in Phoenix then.  [Chino-Bandido's Takee-Outee](https://i.imgur.com/Hf8dMKs.jpg)
$C: If you live near Phoenix, there is a place with a similar concept called Chino Banditos. Very good.
$C: I desperately hope the house soundtrack is Mariachi music played on traditional Chinese instruments.
$C: If you‚Äôre near Queens, in my neighborhood a former Greek restaurant was bought by a Mexican restaurant. Rather than replace the sign it‚Äôs now proudly/illogically ‚ÄúEl Athens Grill‚Äù.
$C: If user name checks out, also ask for their timings
$C: >Where is this magical restaurant? 

Tahiti?
$C: Turning Mexican food restaurants to Chinese food restaurants and vice-versa seems to be pretty common in my experience. After all most restaurants [fail in their first year](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/20/heres-the-real-reason-why-most-restaurants-fail.html). The Chinese takeout down the street I like, still has Spanish style architecture.
$C: Carpool?
$C: This is actually from a bar in Toledo, called the Mexican Panda.  This is an imaginative backstory though.
$C: I‚Äôm convinced this post was made for this joke.
$C: Underrated joke.

For those wondering.  Soy = ‚ÄúI am‚Äù in Spanish.
$C: ‚ÄúHola Sauce, yo soy Pap√°!‚Äù
$C: I speak Spanish and didn‚Äôt get this. Oops.
$C: I‚Äôm currently taking Spanish classes and it still took me a solid five minutes to figure this joke out.
$C: Soy milk. 
$C: You mad fucking genius.
$C: For some reason, I‚Äôm imagining Se√±or Chang coming up from behind them going ‚ÄúSup, bitches?‚Äù
$C: Trying desperately not to laugh in class
$C: Thank you for this.

$C: It was a struggle and a half to not bust out laughing at this while at work.
$C: You've hit the peak shifty.  Drop the mic and ride off into the sunset.
$C: Oso brilliant!
$C: I can just see the guy gently caressing it while whispering that. 
$C: I'm Mexican and feel ashamed that it took me a good 5 minutes to get the joke 
$C: Had a buddy buy Soy chorizo once thinking it was just saying "I am chorizo", nope just vegan.
$C: Take your upvote. 
$C: Perfect
$C: aaaaand saved
$C: Hahahahahahaha that's some funny shit 
$C: You're one of my favorite Redditors. I see your comments everywhere. That said, this may be your best ever work right here. Absolutely tremendous. Well done. 
$C: Also painted peppers on the bamboo stalks. 
$C: its going over my head and i feel no
$C: Looks like I have a new favorite joke. 
$C: Im glad you got gold for this. Well done. 
$C: More likely: "You're what?"
$C: A Spanish Cartesian walks into a former Chinese restaurant. Wondering what the bottles of black liquid are and why they are in a Mexican restaurant, he picks one up. 

Upon reading the label, he spontaneously transforms into savory black liquid and is promptly pumped and bottled, completing one step of a world-wide scheme to rid the world of rationalists.
$C: My mother tongue is Spanish and had to read comments to get this 
$C: I used to get packages of Soy Chorizo all the time. Now I always read it as "I am chorizo"
$C: Is Soy milk simply introducing itself?
$C: The good news is, they didn‚Äôt have to fire any of the kitchen staff.
$C: I'm stupid, explain?
$C: I don't get it.     
Someone explain?
$C: Well done..had to read it twice and use Spanish dictionary of about 5 words in my brain.
$C: Think globally, act ‚Äúloco‚Äù-ly
$C: It took me a few minutes but when I got it I died laughing. Good job
$C: Nothing has deserved an upvote more than this comment 
$C: I'm Mexican. This joke made me giggle for like 10 minutes. So good.
$C: ayyy lmao
$C: Reddit silver!
$C: Oh, it‚Äôs definitely a mustache.
$C: Guy sipping from the stream has one too.
$C: I like the festive braids on the one in the tree too!!
$C: And the girl panda has sharpie eyebrows.
$C: Looks like it may have been a fish at one point that they turned into a fish taco.
$C: Bamboo Tacos, mmmm
$C: I was looking at it, scanning it over,  and excitedly shouted "there's one eating a taco!". My girlfriend was confused. 
$C: That panda is my spirit animal.
$C: First read this as "panda eating taco".  Didn't recall seeing a panda being devoured by a taco when I first looked at it...
$C: That‚Äôs my spirit animal
$C: Then may I direct your attention to the delightful sombrero wearing panda, a panbrero if you will, to the left. Lucky bastard's got a damn big taco.
$C: I suggest you make this your desktop background and then go get some tacos!
$C: you and me both buddy. have an ehug
$C: I feel less depressed after i read that you are less depressed. 
$C: I just watched that jimmy kimmel DACA video so yeah it helped.
$C: That is relevant AF. On a side note, we must return it back to its home.
$C: It's the "boom" that makes it real. Boom.
$C: Trenzas
$C: Frida?
$C: Cracked me up
$C: Panditos wearing panbreros.
$C: If you would have said pandejos instead of panditos, you'd have reddit oro right now. 
$C: That pandido has some serious munchies
$C: Came looking to make sure someone mentioned Chino's. 

Man I love their food!
$C: Also the cactus, which I'm assuming was painted over bamboo
$C: Just like The Dude's rug.
$C: I'd like to think those were already part of the mural
$C: can i have a Kung Pao Bamburrito, Peking Duck Mole, Chow Mang, a Green Tea Horchata.... oh and some beef emPandadas.
$C: Jest all you like, but a place near me serves Chinese/Mexican food, and it's glorious.

I'll take the jerk fried rice with cuban beans, the Pollo Diablo in a quesadilla, and Jade Red Chicken in a burrito.

Heartburn for dayyyyyyys.
$C: You joke but spanish/chinese places are great.
$C: There was a chinese/tex-mex place near where I lived in Dallas. Full take-out box of fried rice for ~$5 and pulled pork tacos for a buck. Great stuff. 

 
$C: I'm really hungry right now and I would definitely eat either of those with zero complaints.
$C: Lol dammit i just posted the same and saw this. So yum 
$C: This is the same restaurant
$C: Dammit you beat us all to it!!!
$C: That‚Äôs where I thought this was! 
$C: Love that place!   Chicken diablo and jamican jerk rice.  Yuuuum. 
$C: Fusion
$C: Where my family is from in Mexico, the city was founded by Chinese people. The food that comes out of that city is a hybrid of mexican and Chinese food. It is seriously the best food you will ever have! 
$C: The mural is the only hybrid thing here, it‚Äôs pretty authentic food. On another note, Irish/Mexican is something I have never heard of 
$C: Mescaline trip Panda. Trippin balls on the Great Wall
$C: You beat me to it!
$C: In North Phx riiiight
$C: Pandido 
$C: agreed
$C: Oh I see you are a cultured one!
$C: I would eat the shit out of Szechuan chorizo 
$C: Ha!!
$C: That's going to be the pizza place moving in next.
$C: True fact: there used to be a Pizza Hut next door to this place but it burned down. 
$C: Something something appropriation 
$C: I've found a value to convert:

- 200.0ft is equal to 60.96m or 320.0 bananas
$C: my thoughts exactly! [reference](http://chinobandido.com/)
$C: you have no idea how much I absolutely love this.

Like literally. Can I get a poster of this to hang on my wall ?
$C: Atleast they get to eat Bamboo tacos
$C: That's a Bamboo taco, you fool! 
$C: I hear they enjoy eating Bamboo for the taste despite it being hard on their digestive system.

So it fits the mexican food theme pretty well
$C: Just regard the general idea of cultural appropriation outside of others literally invading, dominating, stealing artifacts, and destroying other people's culture (which was the original idea for the concept) to be stupid as shit.
$C: Maybe because it's a Chinese/Mexican restaurant.
$C: I suddenly want to see what a white people version of this mural would be like.
$C: But a white would say racist with a w to make it more in appropriate 
$C: That would work if the Pandas were Spanish, not Mexican
$C: Fongs tastes so good but makes me so sick!
$C: I was thinking of this exact place! I love it!
$C: Yes! Also the cactai in the foreground and the chiles in the trees.  They did a great job of subtly changing the context of the painting. 
$C: Since cultural appropriation is a false issue made up by people that love to go around being outraged at everything, I would say that this isn't cultural appropriation.
$C: Yes, a local restaurant in Forsyth, MO called Chinese Mexican Burrito
$C: Technically, "Sushi" and "Taco" are just cooking techniques, not a food in themselves. You can Make Mexican Sushi and Japanese Tacos...
$C: We have a Korean and Mexican fusion restaurant here called tacorea. 
$C: As u/Italianfreshness pointed out, there's a place in Phoenix called [Chino Bandidos](http://chinobandido.com/). As a fellow native of Arizona, this made me happy. 
$C: I love this wayyyyy too much. 
$C: I thought this was them at first! 
$C: me too!
$C: and now it got gold!
$C: Female pandas raise cubs on their own (the male leaves after mating).
$C: Do you remember it? 
$C: We have one in Denver and it‚Äôs absolute horseshit.

Although I‚Äôm confused about why your butt hurts.
$C: There's one in Phoenix called Chino-Bandido's and it's fucking heavenly.  They throw a little Jamaican in there too for extra colon cleansing.
$C: I've seen a few grimy joints in LA that do the same, mainly in the neighborhoods west of downtown. I can vouch for Bamboo Express, a little place near my mom's house. Getting fried tilapia alongside chow mein and egg rolls is pretty cool and goes together fairly well. 

It either arises from the restaurant owners cooking for the local Latino population, or because the restaurant owners are Latino immigrants who once worked in Chinese places. 
$C: Dunno bout Mexican/Chinese, but we have a few Mexican/Korean places where I am and it's effing amazing! Kalbi Chimichanga served in a way that looks kinda like a sushi roll is my favorite. So... Good.. 
$C: Me too!
$C: now Skeeter, they ain't hurtin' nobody...
$C: Not sure why you were downvoted. It's a fair question.
$C: I don‚Äôt think Pandas are bears but nice pun.
$C: [deleted]
$C: There's got to be some place in that gigantic culinary melting pot eclectic enough to do both.
$C: General Tso's Chicken Enchilada Plate
$C: And the world goes on and you still get to post on reddit. 
$C: Plus mustaches and cactai.  Lots of cool subtle little changes

$C: Can't unsee
$C: There was a former sports bar that turned into a New Orleans/cajun-themed restaurant in my hometown. It then closed and reopened as an Indian restaurant. It had purple walls and gold and green confetti painted on the walls and exposed ductwork, TVs everywhere playing sports, belly dancers, and an Indian buffet. It was really something.
$C: Go on 
$C: What a weird thing to tag me in. I'm so confused as to why... :|
$C: If you read through the comments, you will realize no one actually cares about ‚Äúcultural appropriation‚Äù. It‚Äôs just people complaining about people saying cultural appropriation.
$C: What jobs are they stealing?
$C: Racist pos
$C: This story is so unrealistic. Pandas aren't marsupials.
$C: Cry more
$C: SJW: "this is incredibly offensive! I can't believe they make you work in an environment that's so disrespectful to your culture."

CASHIER: "I painted it, and i'm not Mexican. I'm cuban."

$C: I don't get it, what's wrong with cultural appropriation?
$C: Liberals be artistic. Like the other person wrote, Panda Expressionism
$C: Wow, so well thought and educated. Thank you fellow redditor for that insight. I think I feel euphoric in this moment.
$C: The local Chinese restaurant in my old neighbourhood changed to Mexican (same owners - new menu). They changed the name to Happy Fresh Tortilla Taco. 

Food sucked, but I ate there just for the name.  
$C: It‚Äôs a special thing restaurants do for Taco Tuesday. Some of the more ‚Äúupscale‚Äù Mexican/taco  restaurants in my area do this and they discount their normally $3-4 single tacos to $1. Same taco, lower price. You‚Äôd eat the $1 taco. 

Plus, some of the best tacos are like $1.25 off taco trucks near construction sites. Taco trucks are the shit.
$C: I want an all you can eat Mexican buffet 

1 dollar tacos sound legit
$C: And has a mustache!!
$C: Don't forget about the little nopales added in too! 
$C: Mexicana here and don‚Äôt know what a Vihuela is
$C: Man that‚Äôs one spicy taco 
$C: And there's a panda playing a classical guitar!
$C: A bamboo taco 
$C: Don't forget those moustaches
$C: Bamboo taco no doubt.
$C: This is like a Leslie Neilson movie, every subsequent viewing yeilds another surprise lol.
$C: *Dos tacos
$C: Also look at the nopal (cactus) 
$C: Everything in that painting is racist. I bet the owners are white people lmao
$C: The guy who painted the sombrero‚Äôs is a girl, actually 2 girls üòÇ 

And thank you. I will take that as a compliment üòÅ
$C: Work smarter, not harder
$C: Did you just assume the painters gender?
$C: Mexicans are a resourceful people, we use what were given. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Eggroll. 
$C: They'll make the pandas fatter.


$C: i dont know, you could substitiute the violin and nacho for some cool guns.
$C: Ranch dressing anybody?
$C: Hahaha,  no I think Obama will stand in the heaven above the pandas, and lots of drones will fly around killing half of the pandas, isn't that what got him the Nobel peace prize anyway?
$C: Burritos Chinitos
$C: Frito Pandito
$C: Los Pandas hermanos
$C: /thread

You nailed it
$C: Taco-chino hehe
$C: Chingadita!!
$C: Pandaricos
$C: Now I can't decide!
$C: Pandandele! Andele! Pandarriba!
$C: Came here for the Chino Bandido but now I‚Äôm sad the one in chandler is gone.
$C: +1 for Chino Bandido. I make sure I stop by every time I‚Äôm in Phoenix 
$C: Yes! I love the jerk chicken quesadilla and the jade red chicken burrito. They closed the one near me so I haven't been able to go there in a long time.
$C: Chiming in to say Chino is legit some of the best food you'll ever have in your life. Cannot recommend hard enough.
$C: I‚Äôve been there. Awesome food.
$C: Their jerk chicken and black beans are some of the best I‚Äôve had. I miss living in Phoenix sometimes!
$C: I just booked a trip to Arizona! Definitely will be stopping there. 
$C: Takee Outee 
$C: Well, that just sounds fantastic.  I wish we had something like that where I live.
$C: Been there and the panda Pancho Villa statue is legit
$C: Therse also a chinese mexican place in Minneapolis called El Chino Latino
$C: They started Asian-Mexican fusion way back in 1990, well before the recent craze!

- Chino Bandido Takee-Outee was founded in November 1990 by Frank and Eve Collins, husband and wife. The blend of Mexican and Asian cooking styles and flavors came about from Eve‚Äôs Chinese background and both Frank and Eve being native Arizonans. The original store was only 1000 square feet, seated 16, and was modeled after those ‚Äúhole-in-the-wall‚Äù restaurants that Frank and Eve love. As soon as they realized that people wanted to stay in to eat, as opposed to taking it out, they expanded the restaurant year by year, until the restaurant grew to over 5,000 square feet, seating about 150.
$C: In Georgia and the Carolinas there‚Äôs a similar restaurant called Takosushi. Pretty good eats. http://tako-sushi.com/our-story/
$C: We have gone there.  It‚Äôs really good
$C: clicked on this article just to search for Chino Bandido.
$C: It looks horrifically awesome! 
$C: Thanks, now I‚Äôm hungry. For Mexican pandas.
$C: I now have a goal of eating at chinobandido. How did I not know of this place?
$C: Was going to say this reminds me of one of my favorite restaurants in the world. 

Love the chino bandido
$C: I was literally scanning comments to see if I was the only one who recognized it. Have an upvote, friend. 
$C: As a Mexican that mix looked interesting, but [when i saw that they serve bowls](https://k60.kn3.net/taringa/7/B/6/C/3/6/vagonettas/970.gif)...
$C: So confused on the naming of that lol
$C: Where does the guy stand? Is he on the bed or standing in front?
$C: I'm confused...
$C: Is that why pandas are going extinct?
$C: Mexican Touchdown!!!!!!!!!!
$C: Reddit is a magical place where both these things can exist and be brought together
$C: Middle finger in belly button? That just leaves the thumb to finger her elsewhere, and that's just weird.
$C: And I thought I've done it all, always more poo-play to discover 
$C: That‚Äôs fusion with a capital F
I‚Äôd definitely go there if I was near there 
$C: I went there cause of guy fieri. It's not that good :c
$C: I‚Äôm sad this has been buried so far down 
$C: This is the only logical choice. 
$C: Do they serve Nacho Libre?
$C: What activities? Siestas? Drinking tequilas?  They didn‚Äôt paint a panda or donkey with stripes to make it look like they do with a zebra in Tijuana? 
$C: Wong answer.  Twy again 
$C: The daily special AKA The Hong Kong Sing Song Pingpong Special. 
$C: Frito Bandito
$C: Couldn‚Äôt keep up.   The thought of throwing that in did occur to me though.  
$C: *Fun Fact- on Friday and Saturday nights instead of live music, Nacho Panda has Lucha Libre wrestling with Sumo Wrestling matches in between.   Fun for the entire family 
$C: It is I, Sancho Panda!

I bring you burritos!
$C: Hahahah well at first I got excited when you said Utah because I‚Äôm driving through right now but after reading the whole comment...hard pass hahaha. How do you go out of business with such innovative dishes like bowls of ice?!
$C: I live in Ogden, UT. 

Can confirm,  food was really strange and the owner was really eccentric. 

They restored the sign though, so that's cool. 
$C: Oh man, just imagine if China didn't have that great wall, they'd have so many Mexicans and tons of awesome signs.
$C: The Egg Foo Young Sandwich is a regional dish here in St. Louis known as the St. Paul Sandwich. I've never been tempted to try it.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Paul_sandwich
$C: Utah in the house!
$C: There's also a lot of Cuban Chinese places because when the US banned Chinese people many went to Cuba
$C: I'm starving, I could go for a nice bowl of ice right now lol
$C: Dafuq is Bowl of Ice? 

Is it like glass jelly or literally a bowl of ice?
$C: Lmao ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôll have the bowl if ice please.‚Äù.
$C: How is it possible to combine the greatness that is chinese and spanish food and turn it into shit?

This angers and disturbs me.
$C: The Egg Foo Young Sandwich is a regional dish here in St. Louis known as the St. Paul Sandwich. I've never been tempted to try it.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Paul_sandwich
$C: Egg foo yung sandwich sounds awesome.
$C: Ayyy I'm from utah as well. I'm surprised I've never heard of it.
$C: technically, mexican food and chinese food are all the same. Weird meats, rice as a side, and funny music. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: This sounds ghastly but I suppose I should try before I hate. 
$C: lol Haven't been to Az in many years so i didn't know about this place until I visited for a day and took a family member to P.F Changs and she was all mad I didn't take her to the "Chinese-Mexican" place. 
$C: See ya there! 

JADE CHICKEN
$C: Always a good idea!
$C: Ugh I miss Chino....it's SO GOOD. Have some Jade Red for me!
$C: Squanch you buddy 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Noooo only one now :( chandler location closed a few years ago 
$C: Had nothing to do with the food - just a shit location; sadly. 
$C: 19th Ave & Greenway :) 
$C: It's delicious. They give samples if you're not sure what to order, highly recommend. I moved out of state but will be in town this weekend and definitely hitting it up.
$C: As long as they are not Sugar-Free gummy bears. pls no.

$C: If he were Japanese instead, there is also this [not-racist-at-all product](https://imgur.com/a/o1GWC) I found at my local Mexican store.
$C: Panditas are the shit, specially the red ones, throw the lime ones out.
$C: No thats some wholesome marketing.
$C: omg
$C: I see you're a man of culture.
$C: I am Chinese and Mexican!

Although, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm that gorgeous. üòÖ
$C: I always found the offspring of 2 ethnicity from opposite sides of the world to be better looking than average.  Maybe it's the gene pool breathing a sigh of relief.
$C: Cousin is half Thai half Israeli. She is a model and a source of jealousy
$C: Can confirm, my grandmother was half Chinese and half Spaniard, that woman could have stopped traffic in her day. Thankfully the apples didn't fall too far from the tree
$C: You motive me. 
$C: Pics or it didn't happen, OP pls.
$C: Am Vietnamese-Honduran, am gorgeous as well.
$C: As a mom with mixed race kids, your comment made me smile. Love your confidence!
$C: Honestly this is my dream lol
$C: R.I.P. your inbox.
$C: I really hope your name is Clarissa.
$C: How you doin'?
$C: pic or it didn't happen
$C: I'm a half-white, quarter-Hispanic, quarter-Indian (dot, not feather--thanks Columbus) dude and I think I'm pretty good looking. At least I seem to benefit from most of the things mentioned in the AskReddit "what do attractive people get that ugly people don't" type threads.

The drawback is when you're pursuing an Indian girl who doesn't care about race but to whose parents I'm neither white nor Indian enough...(bonus points: her parents care about race because they "want attractive children". Shouldn't they want to mix some then?)
$C: I normally wouldn't post a comment like this, but.. Wow, my fucking jaw dropped on seeing that photo. 
$C: Relevant name?
$C: I‚Äôm about ugly as hell 
$C: I believe you!  
$C: I have always said that biracial babies are the cutest.
$C: Oh no...their kids are going to be narcissists...
$C: Callate Pedro!         

           

Post picture or you're Pedro.
$C: I really want to see how you look like. That's such a interesting racial combination.
$C: Huh
$C: And named Clarissa judging by the username 
$C: Wow I wanted to say this but you beat me to it!
$C: Is your name Clarissa?
$C: I need a picture! 
$C: Chitina 
$C: You got anything to back that up?
$C: And according to Dave Chapelle, they‚Äôll be the hardest working kids ever.
$C: Sure you can, Clarissa!
$C: we're gonna need pics, for proof....

if you're shy, just show us that backside.
$C: Need proof
$C: [Why don‚Äôt you have a seat please](https://i.imgur.com/rlwyRMf.jpg)
$C: Can confirm.am also Chinese-Mexican.  Am Amazing 
$C: This isn't Star Trek
$C: Well, shit.  I was kinda hoping you weren't because of how matter-of-factly you said it, but damn dude.
$C: Wait, are you like, half Argentinian, and half Chinese? 

Or Chinese, born in Argentina, which technically still makes you Chinese-Latina?

And yes, you‚Äôre very pretty!
$C: Source checks out.
$C: any Latinas in this thread want some soy sauce?
$C: Hey
$C: -Dave Chapelle

$C: YOU ARE INSENSITIVE TO OUR INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE MR. CHAPPELLE! 
$C: oh shet 
$C: Am Filipino. Have been mistaken for being either Chinese or Mexican by other Chinese and Mexicans.

Although, I am part Chinese, so there's that. 
$C: The Philippines.

 The answer to the question, ‚ÄúWhat if M√©xico and China were to have a baby?‚Äù 

Source: SNL (trying to find the video) 
$C: Pretty much. 

Source: I am Filipina 
$C: underrated comment here.. lol
$C: Ê≤°Á§ºË≤å
$C: Welcome to reddit! This is a weird way to start out your adventures here, I must say. 
$C: I live in the Bay Area and a good number of my closest friends are Mexicans and I am also Chinese (mixed however). Maybe that has something to do with it 
$C: Honestly, my family loves him. It was his family(mother in law) that wasn't as accepting of me. 

Story: In laws were in the process of moving. The 3rd time I met MIL she said to me "You need to make more Mexican friends so that we can have cheaper movers". I was shocked and nervously laughed. Now that we have been married for years, that shit won't fly. 
$C: Am Mexican, literally what are you talking about.
$C: Am Chinese-American.  When I went to Mexico, everyone was super nice to me and my family.   
$C: LA is soo weird.

Growing up, the only Mexicans I ever saw on tv were the cholo and ese gang members that they would show.

Being a Mexican American that grew up in NYC, I didn't know they were of Mexican decent. That's because we didn't have that culture up here. I started doubting whether I was really Mexican or not.

Now find out that they hate Asians out in LA?

That's weird.

$C: I think it's just the ones in LA. My brother moved there last year, and one of the first things he noticed was that many Latin Americans seemed kind of hostile towards him. 
$C: I think how you are treated probably has a little to do with weather you are a female asian or male asian. 
$C: We Mexicans do not hate Chinese people... in what world are you living in?
$C: Mexican people don‚Äôt hate chinos vatoloco, Chicanos and people from American nationality but Mexican descent are very protective of their culture devolving into racism, I‚Äôm sorry if that‚Äôs your case.

Source: je suits le mexicain 
$C: Depends if they're people who spent most or all of their lives in their country, and what country and area that they're living in now.

[domestic] Chinese can be the same sort of way about _any_ foreigner, not just Mexicans.
$C: Am Chinese. That sounds like a you problem.
$C: Of course when they met, they should have thought "Nah this can't happen between us. We shouldn't mix our races since we need to preserve them". Stupid cunt.
$C: lmao kys
$C: Happy cake day!!
$C: Cake!
$C: Feliz d√≠a del pastel!

$C: You know what they say, quit while you're at the top.
$C: Somebody mind explaining? I googled it and found "pendejos" but that means asshole apparently
$C: https://i.imgur.com/YOcdhBm.png
$C: The joke

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Your head
$C: Over here friends call each other "marica" it means "faggot" but it is like "cunt" for aussies here. I don't see pendejos as something too rude
$C: Ok, I'll bite. How is this racist?
$C: Sometimes I have to step back and wonder if I am actually being over sensitive when I see something I consider racist, sexist, or otherwise insulting. 

But then people like you show up
$C: este guey
$C: Do they have bamboo tacos?
$C: I went to JMU and never ate here?? Welp, guess I'm heading down this weekend..
$C: I bet they have the same cooks too. 
$C: holy shit never thought I'd see Harrisonburg on reddit ever. How have I never heard of this place before?
$C: It‚Äôs weird seeing your favorite local restaurant on the front page 
$C: Finally something good on Reddit from VA, I feel like we never have anything 
$C: I'm going to JMU on Friday to meet up with my broke younger brother. I will definitely have to take him here!
$C: Hello from Harrisonburg! I've lived here for years and never been there. To be honest, I always thought it looked kind of sketchy. I guess it's on my list in the next week or so now!
$C: Never thought I‚Äôd see Harrisonburg on the front page lol. Love that place!
$C: Hburg getting some love! I went to college down the street!
$C: H-burg townies represent üëå
$C: Woah man, go Dukes! I'll have to try this place out.
$C: Go Dukes!
$C: Found their yelp page and was pretty disappointed. Not a SINGLE photo of this is on their yelp page. Please fix this OP.
$C: Oh man, I stop in Harrisonburg twice a year on my way to/from NC....I am totally diverging from my usual Texas Roadhouse tradition this time. 
$C: legend has it that the $1 tacos are the only way they can move their panda meat. you have been warned!
$C: Go dukes?
$C: Usually my first thought with posts like this is "oh man, too bad it's probably on the other side of the world." But this is actually close for once!
$C: https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/el-sol-mexican-restaurant-harrisonburg-2

This one?
$C: Duuuuuuuukes!
$C: As a JMU alum, I will always think Taqueria El Primo is the best Mexican place in Harrisonburg. But now I want to try this place!
$C: I go to jmu and never heard of this????
$C: How far is this from VA beach? I love me some $1 tacos.
$C: 1 dollar tacos !??!! What a magical discovery
$C: Too bad they are closed on Wednesdays.
$C: Sweet! How close is it to the interstate and is it "road trip friendly"?
$C: Oh wow I spend a week near there every year visiting family. I‚Äôll have to check this place out next time I‚Äôm nearby.

Btw there‚Äôs a really fantastic Indian restaurant by the Costco called Taste of India. Some of the best Indian food I‚Äôve had, and I‚Äôm from a city with pretty great Indian options. 
$C: Heyyyyyy not often you hear about Harrisonburg. Great Mexican food in general in this town. 
$C: Holy shit!  Hey neighbor!  Is this the is Mexican restaurant than went in by Arby's?  I remember the Chinese restaurant from when I was a kid, haven't been in since it switched over.  I'll have to make a trip.  
$C: Woahh small world moment! Used to go to JMU but never been here before! Is this where Great Wok used to be?
$C: Dukesssss!!!!
$C: Wow never thought I‚Äôd see Harrisonburg on the top of the front page. Roll Dukes!
$C: I knew it!!! I've been there!!!
$C: I live near there! I'm going to check it out!
$C: Dude, I‚Äôm going!
$C: Holy shit that‚Äôs close to me!
$C: I live like an hour away. Totally gotta go here.
$C: Next time you're in tell them to put the chichen itza in the background on that mountain. Still looks too asian.
$C: That's crazy, they did the same thing in Taqueria Chingon in Omaha, Nebraska. I'm actually going there later tonight, will take pictures.
$C: Ooh that's within a drivable distance from me. I'll make a trip there one day just for the pandas
$C: Cville here üôÇ
$C: Wild, i used to eat there all the time when i worked up in the park. Never noticed the pandas though!
$C: I wanna go to Virginia just for this restaurant 
$C: Wow that‚Äôs actually right near me! 
$C: Hmm, I've got a road trip coming up next weekend thatll take me down 81.  Might have to make a stop!
$C: So I went to Google Street View and scrolled back the date to see if it was a Chinese place during any of the times the Google car drove by. I didn't see it as a Chinese place, but the earliest photos from 2012 indicate that it was also formerly *another* Mexican place called El Rancho. 

That's kinda funny, I wonder if they were the ones who painted the sombreros.
$C: They're going to need to buy a lot more tacos after today
$C: Ever since taco bell shutdown I've missed the sacred dollar tacos 
$C: hell yeah.  I'm only 80 mins from Harrisonburg.  I'll make my way down there soon.  Thanks for this gem! 

$C: C'mon, with the money they saved by only painting sombreros on the pandas' heads they should be doing $.25 tacos on Tuesday. 
$C: 4 hours and 20 minutes away.... hmmmmmm.
$C: My wife and I seem to visit or at least pass through nearby Staunton, VA about once a year or so (we live in DC).  I'll have to try and remember to pay a visit!
$C: Bro front royal va I'm there 
$C: Omg I live like 30 minutes away.. How have i not eaten there.. I need to go. Tonight.
$C: Holy shit. A restaurant that's actually close to me
$C: Saw this and could have sworn this mural was super familiar. I was right! They have awesome tacos for sure. 
$C: Are they real tacos though? I love Taco Bell, but those aren't tacos...
$C: I knew it looked familiar! 
$C: Welp! Now there isn‚Äôt going to be a taco Tuesday at this restaurant... :/ (maybe) Unfortunately this comment has gone viral and the guy who created taco Tuesday has a legal right to sue anyone who profits from using the two words ‚Äútaco Tuesday‚Äù.
$C: Totally not an ad. 
$C: Damn! It‚Äôs closed today. It‚Äôs definitely getting the Reddit bump tomorrow. 
$C: I live in Harrisonburg! 
$C: J

M

U
$C: hey that‚Äôs in my state! i‚Äôll have to take a trip down there.
$C: Never thought I'd see my hometown on here.
$C: I'm going on a road trip in the United States in the summer, and this place will definitely be one of my stops. Thank you OP
$C: Holy shit that‚Äôs right up the road from me! I‚Äôm in Winchester. I‚Äôm def gonna have to make the drive to see this haha 
$C: WHAT THE HELL HOW DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS PLACE WHEN I WAS AT JMU?!?!?!
$C: Hm...two hour drive from where I live.  Passed through there at Christmas.  If I had only known!


$C: Looks like a great place! They should put a gigant sombrero on the roof too! https://goo.gl/GnkKCY
$C: Do they play the "Mexican Hat Dance" with Chinese instruments?
$C: Whaaaaaat, i need to go there now
$C: Harrisonburg? Love that place
$C: Dude, I live in Richmond. If I find myself in Harrisonburg I'm definitely looking this place up.
$C: I‚Äôm from Harrisonburg! Outside of /r/FCS I didn‚Äôt think I would see Harrisonburg mentioned haha. 
$C: Go Dukes!
$C: You must go to JMU!  Is Brothers Craft Brewery still there?
$C: I went to JMU. Was this there in '98 - '02? Never mind. Saw the same question lower.
$C: Phoenix AZ has a Chinese Mexican fusion with a similar mural called Chino Bandinos. 
$C: That's less than an hour from my house. I'm so gonna go next time I'm up that way. 
$C: I spot a fellow duke
$C: I never had Tacos in my life 
$C: Dollar for a taco? that's expansive. 

$C: What! Wow that's not too far from where I live mahbe I'll go!
$C: Go dukes!
$C: Harrisonburg, VA?!

Color me surprised. Might have to make a trip.
$C: Is you're name [Jesus?](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/el-sol-mexican-restaurant-harrisonburg-2?select=ouMwLibqwleNbbm4RTXOhg)
$C: Oh shit, a post about cool restaurants in my state? Sick!
$C: Oh shit that‚Äôs actually close to me
$C: $1!
$C: I would definitely go there some time in the next week and show them this post.

You just virtually alerted 200,000 people to the existence of this resturant, and the reception is mostly positive.  You can't pay for advertising this good.

Get get a free taco, just [don't slip on your skateboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMdtYZFTvhY)
$C: Good old Harrisonburg.

But yep! Used to be China Inn; was one of my best friend's favorite  places to convince his parents to take us when we were kids. They always had things like Pok√©mon and whatever iteration of Dragon Ball on the one TV in the place over their koi pond/fountain...
$C: I will go to that place at some point in my life.
$C: I love the panda on the left eating a fish taco! 
$C: Se√±orita Panda de la arbol
$C: I think he looks like [Don Corleone](https://www.marketing360.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/don-corleone.jpg)
$C: I‚Äôd love it just a little more if pandette had a unibrow like Freda Kahlo. https://i.imgur.com/aRuP5Qs.jpg 
$C: theres chiles painted on the bamboo too
$C: Super spicy good food. I'd highly recommend the lava cookies too.
$C: Can confirm. Food is fantastic! (Source: live 3 miles away.)
$C: OH GOD I MISS CHINO SO BAD
$C: And that's the greatest restaurant name ever!!!
$C: To love is human, to Chino is divine.
$C: Came here just to make this comment.  
$C: I grew up eating here almost every Sunday. I would order a cheese quesadilla with a side of steamed rice and cover everything in soy sauce. Wasn't until I was older that I realized how weird it was that I put soy sauce on my quesadilla.    
   
And I second the lava cookies. Soooooo good.
$C: I was just looking to see if anyone mentioned Chinos. I lived in Phoenix for several years. Anytime I visit this it‚Äôs one of my must visits. 
$C: Be still my heart, how I miss it so!
$C: There‚Äôs a Korean-Mexican fusion restaurant in Las Vegas called KoMex. http://www.komexexpress.com/
$C: Grew up in the neighborhood and now live too far to eat it weekly like I used too. :-(
$C: I've been there once. I have a picture of my kids climbing the panda. Good time.
$C: To add its‚Äôs Chinese and Mexican tossed together with some Jamaican spices thrown in for good measure.  What‚Äôs nice is they‚Äôll give you little samples on your first visit.  It‚Äôs delicious.  I usually get a split of Jade Red Chicken and Emerald Chicken with Jerk Fried Rice and Black Beans.  The complimentary cookie is a Snickerdoodle, I think the Lava might just be on weekends..
$C: Thank you! I think this thread has given me a few stops on a hypothetical future gastronomic road trip! 
$C: Chico and chang‚Äôs Atlanta take out

$C: I kept saying "Kikoman" to myself and was super confused. Thanks for explaining it to me. I'm a terrible Mexican 
$C: A local sushi place here in Tucson has the slogan "Soy awesome"
$C: Thank you.... hahahaha 
$C: I speak in spanish but i dont get the joke until you explained
$C: Explaining a joke is like dissecting a frog. You get to see how it all works on the inside, but you kill the frog.
$C: and sauce is a tree type :

$C: And the other guy says "yo! no soy marinara?"
$C: I am salsa? 
$C: If if soy milk was just trying to introduce itself?

$C: Jokes are definitely underrated when you have to explain them.
$C: I am boy.
$C: S O C K S!  I'm speaking Spanish!
$C: Every time I see ‚Äúunderrated joke‚Äù under a highly rated joke, I shit my pants.
$C: I was trying to figure out which Spanish words sounded like Kikkoman - _-
$C: [Soy, yo!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxWxXncl53U)
$C: It seems to be appropriately rated now 
$C: I am sauce?
$C: Ich bin ein taco.
$C: I thought it was "Vinegar", and that that roughly translated into something like " I'm black" in Spanish.
$C: Thanks. I was wondering if I didn't have to be Mexican to understand the joke.
$C: Whole time I was trying to make sense of the joke using the word, ‚Äúkikkoman‚Äù.  <facepalm>  you made absolute sense to me.
$C: I only know this because of Dora the explorer
$C: Thanks... 
$C: And sauce means willow.
$C: Richie Valens keep telling me that you should not use soy in a marinade.
$C: As a mexican, I would have never understood the joke if it wasn't for you.
$C: Thx
$C: I am so sick of the word underrated now
$C: Thanks. This joke was too shifty for me.
$C: Underrated clarification.

Thank you lol
$C: In what way would it be properly rated?  Everyone has to find the same things funny?
$C: No shit buddy
$C: *Recu√©rdame*
$C: r/BromasDePap√°
$C: You clever little f... 
$C: Encantado.
$C: Soy sauce = I am sauce
$C: Me neither, I thought "Soya" and couldn¬¥t get it...
$C: Is it too late to drop the class?
$C: I am a native spanish speaker and still took me a while
$C: Explanation? I want to jajajaja too
$C: I am a native speaker and didn't get it until I saw the explanation. I must be having one of those *slow* days.
$C: Hey man I only took one quarter of Spanish in 7th grade and I got the joke. 
$C: I'm a native spanish speaker and didn't get it because I keep thinking it said "Soya"...
$C: Hi Milk
$C: r/unexpectedLewisBlack

$C: Soy means "I am" in Spanish.  He read "I am sauce" on the label.
$C: Thats is just too adorable!
$C: Not bamboo?
$C: Pandas exist on a diet solely of bamboo.
$C: That'd be panda-eating taco.
$C: That taco is rapidly approaching quesadilla territory. 
$C: Panbrero made me go from giggling at the responses to crying with laughter. Thank you!
$C: I got some tacos and looked at it again. It was nice

$C: So good!
$C: Green tea horchata sounds really good though
$C: Mmm Chino Bandido
$C: ChinoBandido!!
$C: So every country has Chinese food, right? Plus, every country has it's own *version* of Chinese food to fit the tastes of the locals. American Chinese food involves a lot of breaded chicken and sweet sauce, for instance.

I'm here to tell you that the best Chinese food in the world is Indian Chinese food. Everything you love about Indian food and Chinese food *at the same time*.  Tandoori chicken in black bean sauce. Szechuan paneer. It's...just amazing.
$C: Close to us was a Mexican Chinese place called Jings Jalape√±os ... i regret not trying it when they were open
$C: Lol same same saaame 
$C: No it isn't, to quote OP:

>El Sol in Harrisonburg, Va. They do an awesome $1 Taco Tuesday!
$C: Oh yeah. Some of my favorite food for sure.
$C: Where in Mexico? 
$C: There was a place near me that I can‚Äôt spell the name right, something like Shillelagh Ol√© .  There is also Carlos O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs.
$C: Look at the panda staring at the cactus and tell me he isn't having a crisis of self. 
$C: I was just there two weeks ago and get a laugh from the mustachioed, pancho wearing panda statue every time.
$C: Love love love chorizo.  Best chorizo tacos in my county is only a half mile away. 
$C: Of my...quote????
$C: "You've been Bamboozled!!!"
$C: I see this repeated a lot. Do most people just have shit Mexican options where they live, or digestion systems made of tissue paper?
$C: Oh damn, you've outsmarted me
$C: But i would never use the term "cultural appropriation" for those things, i would just describe those things. Its a totally invalid term. 
$C: The pandas will be drinking Starbucks. 
$C: Little red baseball caps on the pandas and assault rifles in the trees.
$C: That #7 Jade Red chicken with some jerk chicken rice. Yes. Please. The owners of this place are so chill too. Just a Mexican lady and Asian man making food that they like in the desert. 
$C: The snickerdoodles complete me.
$C: I saw one in San Antonio. Chino Latino
$C: I know you tagged Ber in this earlier but it's too good
$C: I thought you said, "now you just got gold".
I nearly had a heart attack.
$C: Neat. 
$C: What place in Denver is that?
$C: Well, normally spicy salsa doesn't give me much trouble but imagining Chinese and Mexican together plus spicy salsa, it would do wonders to your stomach. 
$C: Do you have brain damage?

$C: I‚Äôll remember that next time reddit screams about a white kid wearing an Afro for halloween

$C: I checked and Spanish for "panda" is indeed "panda."  
$C: Could it BE any more gone? 
$C: Chino Bandido on 35th Ave & Greenway is still open :) Had to-go dinner from there last week!
$C: Damn, it's gone? I'd eat there once a week about 5 years ago, but it did seem to be getting worse with every visit just before I left.
$C: I lived by that one so I was really really bummed it closed. It was replaced with a Korean fried chicken place which was actually pretty okay. They kept the panda! but then they closed too. :( 

$C: My old boss does that, are you from Atlanta?  
$C: What do you recommend? 
$C: I second this. Chino bandito is the place to be. 
$C: Think about the August heat and it will bring you right back to not missing it lol. Its been 80 degrees the past week and it's only January :(
$C: Just FYI it‚Äôs a hole-in-the-wall place. It‚Äôs also a place where I see cops eat a lot because Phoenix PD knows where all the good restaurants are.
$C: When I was a kid I had the Takee Outee shirt. I wore it till it had holes in it

$C: ‚ÄúHow would you like that served today, iced or hot?‚Äù
$C: Pretty sure it was literally a bowl full of ice cubes.  The owner apparently had a reputation for being something of an eccentric. 
$C: What's a burrito?  Tortilla with cheese meat or vegetables                 
What's a tostada?  [Tortilla with cheese meat or vegetables](https://soundcloud.com/crash-2-1/jim-gaffigan-o-mexican-food)
$C: So I grew up in AZ and ate Chinos quite a bit. When I moved to Florida I would watch this video when I was missing Chinos. Told me sister, who then mailed me a lunchbox cooler full of ice and jade red chicken and jerk rice. It was amazing. I even kept the bowl on the fridge I kept it in inside the fridge and sometimes open it up for a wiff. Love chinos to death
$C: I recommend the Pollo Diablo.  It‚Äôs a nice flavor blend of Mexican spice and Chinese Orange Chicken
Edit: it‚Äôs called Jade Red Chicken. Not Pollo Diablo. Their Pollo Diablo is another tasty item on the menu however.
$C: It has no right to be as good as it is but it's truly amazing, trust
$C: If you haven't tried the jade red quesadilla DO IT
$C: The Chandler location closed, but the North Phoenix location is still open I think.
$C: Just spit out my food laughing at this omg
$C: It's K-momo... Phoenix's original hip hop shop
$C: And their lack of willingness to spend any money on marketing or advertising. Once they started cutting their portions to nothing, I stopped going in. 
$C: Thanks!
$C: It‚Äôs such a weird fusion but I love both ethnic foods. I will brave it up and give it a go. Thanks!!

$C: IDK if they have sugar (they most likely do), but they taste awesome. I haven't tasted [*Panditas √Åcidos*](https://userscontent2.emaze.com/images/a954b920-acfd-4585-b82d-5f1860b42619/1ba3b9ab54e3e42eccba1fabeea09937.png) (Bitter little pandas), but they look tasty.
$C: "Like yelling kwisatz haderach through a coffee-straw"
$C: Do you say this because they make you sick? That happened to me.
$C: On a scale of one to ten how mean would it be to buy them for my mother in law on a ‚Äúdiet‚Äù?
$C: Does anyone have that original story? Classic.
$C: As someone with chronic constipation, I‚Äôve been tempted to try these. 
$C: Haribo hell bears 
$C: The US advertising world was chock-full of racist caricatures back in the early 1900s. Most countries don't have the same complicated relationship with race, so they never felt the need to stop.
$C: The fact that that product says its weight in ounces (and then in grams) makes me suspect that is as Mexican as Taco Bell.  
But racist cartoon characters in Mexican snacks are not [unknown](http://adrenalinaradio.com/radio/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/adrenalina-radio-dud-luis-angel-escalante-activando-tus-sentidos-el-nito-o-negrito-panque-pastelito-bimbo.jpg)
$C: wow
$C: Appropriate disclosure
$C: I kinda like these old school stereotyped heads. The racism in them is so outdatet that its commonly a headshaker, but they are neat little iconografs. Kinda like cave paintings. 

I kinda guess we whities would have to be represented by the monopoly guy. Or a soldier... wich is bad in the same racist way as this chinese guy, so

$C: Yea I live in Hawaii now and as a white person I really feel like the multi-race people are just out of this world beautiful, it's almost not fair. thanks Mom and Dad for both being the whitest white people to ever be white
$C: Can confirm -- my wife is mixed (white/black) and she's a 9/10 on a *bad* day.
$C: My daughter is Mexican and Greek. Cutest baby in the world. Didn't even know babies could be this cute. 
$C: Brazilian Japanese üëå
$C: The most gorgeous girls I've ever met have been Thai-French and Swiss-Brazilian. I'm hoping my Filipino-Mexican child will be equally beautiful.
$C: Humans like unique qualities, eg a black pupy will get picked over any otger in a white litter.
As those rase-mix is uncommon maybe people like it more for the same reason.
I don't know, just hypothesizing
$C: The two most gorgeous people I ever saw in person was an Asian woman who looked like a supermodel and a Black man who looked like a supermodel. They had a little Blasian toddler with them that was absolutely adorable.
$C: I'm Scottish/Palestinian (don't ask, but I essentially look white with an Arabic nose) and my girlfriend is Indonesian. We were out one night in New Orleans, it was our first time traveling through the States and we didn't really know what to expect, what with all the news stories about gun violence and crazy people and whatnot. As we turn down this empty dark street heading back to our guest house, this old homeless man shuffles up to us, barefoot, long beard, staring at us intently with crazy eyes. My girlfriend grabs my arm. He comes right up to us. 

"Y'all are going to have some beautiful babies. Goodnight" and wanders off down the street.
$C: pic plz
$C: This sounds like the hottest combo ever lol
$C: My dad was Mongolian/Mizrahi Jewish.

My mom was white.

$C: i'm talking about getting spat on while walking past a group of mexicans when i was a kid (4th grade).

i'm talking about getting jumped in school for fighting back after they made slanty eyes at me. only to have the mexican counselor lady laugh it off and suspend me.

i'm talking about walking past mexicans at a theatre with my wife and young kids and hearing them snicker "penchi chinos. go back to chinatown."

i'm not saying all mexicans hate chinese people but it sure seems like a recurring theme. maybe it's just the area.
$C: Yeah I live in east Hollywood and the Latinos and Asians seem to get on better than most. 
$C: We don‚Äôt hate Chinese people. The commenter above is crazy, or he/she‚Äôs just easy to hate lol 
$C: Above commenter doesn‚Äôt represent what I‚Äôve seen in LA. 
$C: I think he just grew up in a bad neighborhood. My experience has been pretty opposite. Not to say there aren't stereotypes held on both sides. Also  I think the older generation and traditional types on both sides frown upon interracial relationships. At worst, there's some socioeconomic tension and people have their stereotypes. But I wouldn't say anyone hates each other.
$C: I live in NY for a while. My neighbor was puerto rican. one day i was BBQing and he looks over and says "what are you grilling? (makes 'chinese' eyes at me) and says "chinese food?".  i was like *damn*.. really? otherwise he was a nice guy though. 
$C: That's not true. A lot of LA is mostly Mexican and Asian. Places like Koreatown and Eastern side of LA county. 


$C: los angeles (long beach/paramount area). throughout my childhood (even adulthood) i face racism from mexicans. not all, obviously, but in general i found that mexicans were really hateful towards me. i cant tell you how many fights ive been in from assholes making slanty eyes and calling me penchi chinito. i was always too proud to let it go so i ended up getting jumped a lot.

i live outside of LA now. but i recently made friends with a mexican guy at the dog park. i know he's mexican because he brings it up a lot. anyway, he thinks i'm filipino because i'm not afraid of the sun and rock a goat-tee. he's always talking shit about chinese people. but i let it slide because i'm not petty but it really drives home my prejudice that mexicans hate chinese people..
$C: This. 
$C: or maybe we just grew up in different era, different city.
$C: We're taking about Jewish people, right?
$C: Thanks!
$C: Woo!
$C: ¬°Gracias, amigo!  
Or should I say pandejo?
$C: When I was 11 playing a cheap mmo groups of brazillians or whoever would laugh like that, and my socially illiterate dumbass thought they were repeatedly calling me a jackass

This was a time before IM became widely popular and most communication was still email, so cut me some slack
$C: jejejeje.

$C: In Thai they say 55555555 because the number 5 is pronounced ‚Äúha‚Äù

$C: What do you think the pandas are made of?
$C: Arrest this man, he puns too much...
$C: Dang, I wish I knew which RADIO station I heard this song... it's lost in my HEAD somewhere.
$C: A chingar a su madre de mi Reddit, pinche morro meco.
$C: mexicans love to put puns on swearing. love to play with words that resemble some form of rudeness without saying it. pandas are simply cute silly bears doing cute silly stuff and the Spanish word pendejo can be translated to someone who is not really good at something but the opposite. the action of doing silly stuff contraire to cool stuff is pendejadas and the subject is a pendejo. panda is just taken as the subject and adapted into Spanish. therefore pandejo. 
$C: "Pendejo" + "Panda" = ??? (Come on, you can do it! I see the lightbulb flickering!)
$C: I wish they had panda tacos. I know they're hard to breed, but I'd eat a panda taco.
$C: I'll never eat a piece of meat  
That's one thing I won't do.  
So when I want a special treat  
I fill my tacos with bamboo.
$C: You could probably chop up bamboo shoots and use those as the base of a taco filling or salsa... they seem like they'd pair well with lime and cilantro... 
$C: This is making me wonder if Mexican-Chinese fusion is somehow a thing...
$C: *Pacos. FTFY 
$C: Mema tacos would be a great idea.
$C: don't you want some raw water too ?     
some hipsters, man 
$C: Bamboo tamales
$C: I thought you said bomboo tacos
$C: They have only been in this location for about 2 years.
$C: I‚Äôm at JMU now and had no idea this place was here at all. Now I know where I‚Äôm eating tomorrow though lol
$C: With sombreros 
$C: Yea I was real surprised to see a place I could actually visit one day
$C: I'm a recruiter and need to find some people in Harrisonburg to start in Q2 this year. If anyone needs work PM me.
$C: See but it also has a pretty big University, so I guess it's not *that* surprising. But I have the same reaction when I see anything regarding Virginia on Reddit. I guess since I live here, I don't see it interesting enough to ever mention, so it's a surprise to me when it is mentioned
$C: It was downtown near the Wolfe st. parking deck in a really small location with weird hours for the longest time. Their hours are more normal now that they‚Äôve moved, and they also have a beer license now, but I think the quality of food was a little better before they moved. Still probably the best in town though.
$C: You could‚Äôve had 138k upvotes but no
$C: There was a post here about one of our taco bells some time ago. The one in Alexandria that used to be a bank. 
$C: Well that‚Äôs the vibe of that whole shopping complex really. Try Thai Flavor if you haven‚Äôt, it‚Äôs two buildings over.
$C: Right? Only Mexican I‚Äôve ever known is jalape√±os and El Charro
$C: Va Beach is like 4 hours or so from Harrisonburg. Unfortunately. 
$C: Right off the interstate. Less than a mile... What is "road trip friendly"?
$C: FUCKING YES THAT PLACE IS THE BEST
$C: Roll Dukes??? What kind of alumni are you? lol
$C: 81 south, 64 east
$C: Harrisonburg probably has more authentic mexican restaurants than any city north of Texas.
$C: Yeah, authentic and different kinds of meat. Nothing like the Bell.
$C: It sure is!
$C: Que bonita!
$C: It better be super spicy. My soon-to-be father-in-law owns a Chinese restaurant and he makes this awesome chili sauce from chilies bought at the Mexican market. 
$C: With enough ambition you could live 1 mile away

$C: Lmao!!!
$C: But... But... Kikkoman is japanese soy sauce... You don't mean to say you put that on Chinese food, do you? o.o
$C: Random stuff, but the original meaning of 'Kikko' in Japanese is turtle's shell.
$C: I was trying to figure out what Coca Cola meant in Spanish.
$C: I want to start a dairy business and only hire Kurdish people even though I'm Hispanic. I will call it Kurds and [G√ºey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BCey). 
$C: Glad I‚Äôm not the only one 
$C: what the hell is teriyaki in spanish? Some kind of crystal? ? 
$C: Came here to say this.
$C: Went even further over my head since the reply was in English, I figured that the joke didn't need any translating. I knew it had something to do with Soy Sauce but, even then, I've never heard people being referred to as sauce so that left me completely confused.
$C: Actually, the correct Spanish translation of "I Think, Therefore I Am" is "Pienso, Luego Existo". 
$C: Fookin' laser sights
$C: Sounds like a pretentious motto for veganism. 
$C: That would be an amazing name for a Chinese-Mexican fusion restaurant. 
$C: I suffer from sexlexia. Its a terribly debilitating deasese
$C: Creole que soy sauce!

That's gold Jerry.
$C: I'm Dsylixec too
$C: I love you, whoever you are for that comment alone XD
$C: -Dos cartes
$C: >Thank you.... ~~hahahaha~~ jajajaja

FTFY
$C: that's because soy is soya in spanish. If you assume the label says soy like other people would expect it would make sense almost immediately. If you are hispanic (like me) you might assume the word "Soya" is on the label which ruins it.
$C: That's because the joke makes sense only if you don't speak Spanish.

I mean if I read "soy sauce" my dad joke would be: "claramente no eres [sauce](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salix), eres botella".  
$C: You mean vivisecting a frog. The frog is already dead if you dissect it.
$C: I actually find it funny now that the joke was explained. Frog still alive.
$C: I am Groot?
$C: sauce is salsa
$C: In Mexico, Goku's wife is named Milk
$C: Nether of those conditions was true at the time I commented.  I actually had to scroll down to see the comment and it had single digit upvotes.
$C: That bottle is willow
$C: Fuck, se me antoj√≥ un gansito
$C: Someone before me pointed it out. Wouldn‚Äôt have thought of it otherwise 
$C: Soy sauce = I am a willow tree.
$C: It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm bad at Spanish, I‚Äôm just slow
$C: spaniard here, didn't get it either
$C: Moo cow fuck milk
$C: jajajajajajajaja!
$C: Haha, I get it now.
$C: \*gives thumbs up*
$C: i like the idea but orchata doesn't really mix well with things, tastes horrible with coffee for instance (at least the orchata drunk in spain, not sure about the mexican one)
$C: Where do you live that there is fusion Chinese/Mexican?

I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôll be the same as the one from Mexicali (because it grew organically as opposed to chefs experimenting with tastes) but I definitely would love to go try it. 
$C: Mexicali. 

We moved to Las Vegas a long time ago, and I still miss that food. My favorite food has always been Chinese food and Mexican food. I hate it that the only times that I can have fusion Chinese/Mexican is when I go there. 
$C: We cook with 5 spices... maybe. A large group likely only use salt and pepper. Mexican food is a lot on a digestive track that has only has pepper or salt lol. 
$C: Microbiota shock maybe? You train your gut bacteria to eat a certain diet and suddenly you upset them. Happens a lot for first time travelers so maybe there is a mild version when trying a new cuisine where you live?
$C: [deleted]
$C: The girl panda would be drinking a pumpkin spiced late.
$C: Black pandas would wear ankle bracelets.

edit: my bad, we're shitting on white people.
$C: The Jade Red in a quesadilla and The Pollo Diablo in a burrito!
$C: I've never been there, but when I get back to AZ I'm stopping in. I'll be living in Tucson (my home town), but don't mind the drive. AZ is so underrated for their food. Best Mexican food you'll find north of the border (sorry Texas, it ain't you).

I hate the term "fusion" in regards to food (it just sounds so pretentious), but I absolutely love fusion food. Especially when Mexican is involved. Next time I make it, I'll post a pic of this taco I make. It's beef masala, with shredded kimchi and pico de gallo, on a blue corn tortilla. It's way better than I make it sound. 
$C: Somehow their doodles taste totally better than any doodle I‚Äôve had 
$C: It realllllly isssss 
$C: Man, I have IBS and a fairly delicate stomach but I still don‚Äôt understand why people have trouble with these foods. 
$C: No, Im just tired enough to mistake Pandas for koalas
$C: You have to understand that not everyone shares the same views on things. The people you're talking about might easily not regard what retrofuturekid said.
$C: That's hilarious. What's even funnier is that I^am^a^bot^and^these^are^all^scripted^replies.
$C: Yeah and there‚Äôs always the one Nazi but let‚Äôs not pretend they are not fringe groups.
$C: I feel like its one of those Highlight finders

$C: r/bettereverylook
$C: TacoBell/Panda Express. Coming to every WalMart soon.
$C: And the cactus in the left corner

Edit: I meant there is a cactus in the left corner, but thanks for the laughs XD
$C: OP IS A FUCKING LIAR
$C: One on right has pigtails
$C: No one has mentioned that the female one has pigtails and also eyebrows (or that is actually how you tell that it is a female in the first place), which none of the others have. The pigtails look post chinese place. Not sure about the eyebrows.
$C: is it odd that the first thing i thought was 4 sombrero pandas vs. 1 pigtail braids and flower crown panda = the odds are not in her favor...
$C: It's a specific type of cactus, yes, but not just for cactus in general. It's the big round flat cactus that are usually pickled/cooked and eaten, and they also produce prickly pears, they're delicious. 
$C: In Spanish they are ‚Äúnopales‚Äù
$C: Ohhhh, I knew it as guitarron, but bigger in contrast with the one panda is holding 
$C: Like from Spain?
$C: And a whole lot of Mexican food 
$C: i like your train of thought....
$C: User for 2 hours... 3 comments relating only to this...

It‚Äôs possible, but I‚Äôm calling **shenanigans** 
$C: _I_ painted the sombreros.
$C: Some Bear Rose
$C: Well then just give her a bitcoin.
$C: Cactacians
$C: [deleted]
$C: Empandadas*
$C: It hurts me trying to say this out loud.
$C: No, but they have Sopapillas that are even better than the ones at Casa Bonita.

$C: I tried it! It's good!
$C: Damn, it was I‚Äôm a really bad location. Like how am I ever supposed to know it was even there. Cyclo is good though and hungry monk is one of my favorite spots.
$C: No but I might know them depending on industry 
$C: Honestly anything on the menu, I don't think i've had a bad item.  The Jade red chicken is a good place to start. They let you try stuff there too!
$C: Jerk chicken quesadilla and some form of jade red chicken (I prefer just the chicken over rice, but burrito is acceptable too). I prefer the black beans. There's little containers of sauce for free next to the register, good to dip the quesadilla in.
$C: I live in Vegas now, so the climate isn‚Äôt too dissimilar from Phoenix (usually about 10-15 degrees cooler here). I was just telling someone yesterday I would take 118 and humid over scraping ice off my car any day!
$C: Singing the Mexican national anthem. 
$C: *Mexicanos al grito de gueeeerra!*
$C: Nothing.  A huge portion of those "definitions" are just written by people who like to hold up their sporks.
$C: Art
$C: holy bendy arms, Batman
$C: LONG SLOW CLAPS
$C: Now I get it.
$C: Thank you very much for the NSFW warning lmao 
$C: I am speechless. Thanks. I think.
$C: Thanks, I was looking for a diagram. This is probably the best quality one I've seen.
$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AC9qe5r7Gw
$C: Guess it‚Äôs a Southern California thing.  I could throw in prostitution and pickpocketing but that‚Äôs a small percentage.  I‚Äôm rather fond of the corner hot dog cart vendors with bacon wrapped hot dogs. Something people wouldn‚Äôt usually eat but after drinking it‚Äôs damned good.  
$C: Having been there and ordered off the menu, I'm pretty confident they would have served you a literal bowl of ice cubes.  The reason they'd offer such a thing on the menu is anyone's guess.

This was not a place that came up with creative names for menu items.  It was not even the slightest bit trendy.  It was an ancient chinese place that hadn't been updated since the '70s in a distant suburb of SLC (population 75,000 at the time)
$C: Snow tho
$C: This actually remind me of a joke David Mitchell made on QI, where he said that all sign makers know how to spell "accommodation", but instead of pointing out spelling mistakes, offers a normal service and a premium 10x the price service where they'll correct the spelling mistakes. 

I'd imagine the owner wanted to say "Bowl of Rice", but made a typo and went to one of those menu printers that would charge extra for a spell check. He didn't pay up, they didn't correct it, so now he's just like "fuck it, if anyone asked for it, bring them a bowl of ice".
$C: Oh sweet jesus what is this place
$C: I sometimes get it in burrito form.
$C: Never noticed a cut in portions, tbh. They relied on word of mouth for their first location so, I can see why they did the same with the second. Even though it was nicer than the original Tbird location, it was at the back of an industrial complex, not viewable from the street, next to other businesses that were having the same problem, etc. 
$C: Of course! Let us know what you get and how much you love it ;)
$C: That‚Äôs what you put in your least favorite‚Äôs stocking at Christmas. 
$C: I ate them once on accident. Out of body experience. 
$C: If you make your kids shit themselves, aren't you just punishing yourself?
$C: I want to try them. Who's with me ?
$C: Agreed. They should come with a warning. 
$C: Sprouts sugar free gummy bears destroyed me. 
$C: ANy sugar free candy almost, the sugar alcohols they use as sweeteners are laxative in moderate doses. So eating a couple handfuls of sorbitol or whatever Gummi bears is gonna blow out your colon.
$C: He's talking about Haribo SUGAR FREE Classic Gummi Bears, 1 Lb

>It all started the day prior when my sugar tooth persuaded me to eat 2 handfuls of these sugar-free delights. Fast forward 15 hours 23 minutes and 44 seconds, the world shook. All hell broke loose inside me, a sudden headache, my skin began to perspire and something tore around in my abdomen with force enough to make me latch onto my couch with both hands and let out a sheer cry that sent my dog retreating into the bedroom, she probably knew the battle was already lost. I tried to make for the bathroom but the pressure was so intense I had to wait it out on the couch until a lapse in the gut-busting occurred and I regained control of my muscles. It took only moments before the volcano Mt Anus had blown its top. The air quickly turned poisonous from the methane and sulfuric fumes that spewed forth. Violence and terror are understatements of what happened for the next 45 minutes. I sustained 3rd degree burns from contact with the lava that flowed abruptly from my bowels, my blood pressure was at record levels, and my body mass was reduced by 4 lbs. After ample ventilation of the crime scene I quickly took a shower and changed clothes because the powerful fumes had soaked through the fabric and into the skin. I almost had a mental breakdown in the shower after realizing those little gummy bears had nearly defeated such a man that I thought I was. I can now hardly bare to look forward through the night-terrors and PTSD that will come of this horrid event. . .

$C: Sick is like cold/flu....eating these take you beyond any level of sick. The pain, horror, and level of shitting one experiences after eating these is hell on earth.  I‚Äôll never forget the pain, and I wouldn‚Äôt wish it on anyone. 
$C: Tough one. I dislike my MIL, and she is always on a diet.  I don‚Äôt even think I could do it.  Got mine at Sprouts, and it didn‚Äôt take much before the pain started. I mean, you‚Äôre not killing her, but you are scaring her for life. 
$C: There has to be a better way. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: How is being represented as a warrior or a elite rich guy considered " fair"?
$C: And drink ‚Äòem both together
$C: Hey I‚Äôm Scottish and French!!


Yeah I‚Äôm ugly AF.
$C: it does! 
$C: Do you look ok? We're probably gonna spring out some Vietnamese and Middle East babies in the future, but the people we know who are Vietnamese Lebanese are not great looking at all.
$C: I don't know, aren't Vietnamese the Mexicans of Asians, or was that Filipinos? 

China #1
$C: How did your parents meet?
$C: dead üòÇüíÄ
$C: Can confirm, have friends of mixed race. Some look gorgeous, and some just got the worst features of both sides.
$C: It always is, but higher genetic variety has better odds of a good outcome. Same reason why incest comes with especially bad risks.
$C: definitely a crapshoot.  Got Chinese-Mexican cousins and they fell in the crap territory, sad to say.
$C: Negative. [Hybrid Vigor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosis).
$C: Hard to say. I saw a documentary with a similar scenario in twins. One took got the worst genes. One got all best genes and an Austrian accent.
$C: It doesn't work that way

> Heterosis, hybrid vigor, or outbreeding enhancement, is the improved or increased function of any biological quality in a hybrid offspring.

So, Mixed > Inbred
$C: You just have to choose the best genetics from each of your parents. Like I'm half Asian, half White so I'm good at math and I know a martial art but I'm tall and not a bad driver.
$C: my brethren  
$C: You really are. Such a cutie.
$C: Love eurasian girls/women. always gorgeous.
$C: You should checkout r/hapas
$C: Seems like Hawaii gets tons of tourists who are either elderly or bangin. Or both. Mom and Dad sure are
$C: They're going to have to fight me for that title.
$C: I too look racially ambiguous. My mom's a quarter Chinese and three quarters Spaniard and my dad's Mexican. I am brown and kind of look like I'm from where ever it is that came to mind first, whether it where you're from or where ever.  People walk up to me speaking languages I do not know and I have been expected to know my "native language" of (fill in the blank here) and have had to explain that I'm not from wherever they think I'm from and that I do speak my native language thanks. That said, it is really handy for any time I want to play dumb
$C: #MOTIVE ME!!!
$C: OP delivered, you look great.
$C: \^_\^ Good thinking, 99!

$C: My friend's Japanese mom would pronounce my name "ku-ra-rissa" so you're not off
$C: Thanks! well worth the ask! I used to date an argentinean girl. told her we should made babies. I was right see?
$C: While I empathize strongly with the identity crisis part of things, it's really fucking cool that your dad's Chinese from Germany and your mom's family is from Argentina! Yay for mixed people!
$C: Ni hen Piaoliang!           
I am neither Chinese nor  Spanish but I speak a little of both.
$C: lol - username gave it away sorry chica, 80s kid here. But you linking the IG definitely didn‚Äôt help 
$C: It‚Äôs the username. Doesn‚Äôt help that I had a huge crush on Melissa Joan Hart when I was a kid. 
$C: I'd say it's cuz it was the ghetto, yeah 

really sorry that stuff happened to you tho! 
$C: As a representative of the human race, please accept my humble apology. 
$C: I‚Äôm gonna go with the area thing. Forgive me if I find what you‚Äôre describing hard to believe. We don‚Äôt get enough exposure to Asians to even have strong opinions about you to begin with.
$C: Seriously, this comment really bothered me. 

I‚Äôm Mexican.

I feel like California is lightyears a way from the rest of the country when it comes to... idk how to word it.... racial harmony? 

The vast majority of the state is Asian and Mexican, and there is never any altercation between us, we befriend each other, are part of each other‚Äôs lives, and live peacefully among one another. 

To hear that Mexicans and Chinese hate each other is one of the weirdest things I‚Äôve heard. 

$C: That's horrible. I'm sorry. 
$C: Sounds like you just had shitty/trashy neighbors bro
$C: Some people my friend, sorry that you went through those experiences 
$C: Well, we don‚Äôt hate you... you‚Äôve had some terrible experiences and unfortunate anecdotes, but I can tell you with 100% certainty that this is not a popular sentiment among us. 
$C: Yes. You got us. This is a Jewish conspiracy to defeat the goyim through \#whitegenocide. Then we're going to replace all your bread with matzoh. All of it. 
$C: You're welcome. 
$C: Same to you too! I missed my cake day :(
$C: On a bitch 
$C: No le digas pandejo a mi amigo
$C: Huehuehue 
$C: The Brazilians I know type kkkkkkkk 
$C: in english, dogs go woof woof, but Albanian dogs go " ham-ham" , Portuguese dogs go "au-au", and Malaysian dogs go "gong-gong"
https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/canine-corner/201211/how-dogs-bark-in-different-languages
$C: Brazilians wouldn't say jajaja... it's kkkkkk

Sauce: am Brazilian
$C: Latin Americans would laugh with 'ja's. Brazilians use multiple 'k's
$C: Brazillians speak Portuguese. But point taken. 
$C: you insult my country and my people. we laugh online as : huehuehue, not :jajajaja . i'm so offended
$C: Tibia?
$C: wait, Brazilians don't laugh like that. what were you smoking
$C: Brazilians text-laugh like rsrsrsrsrsrs or kkkkkkkkkkkk, must have been Argentinians or Colombians or something.
$C: Let me guess: Tibia.
$C: Similar situation with 'kk' back when that was for some reason really popular in those mmos. My 8 year old self thought they somehow knew my name and was saying "Okay Kenny"
$C: we dont laugh jajajaja

HEUEHEUEHUEHEUEH
$C: How many is a Brazilian? 
$C: EQ
$C: Socially illiterate...so that‚Äôs what I am..
$C: Kek
$C: Sorry pal. No slack will be allotted a this time.
$C: Kkkkkkk kakakaka
$C: Were you playing Tibia???
$C: > brazillians

ummm...

> Portuguese is the official language of Brazil,[5] and is widely spoken by most of population.


$C: yeah i never understood it either
$C: >cut me some slack

Pun intended?
$C: And that game? Ragnarok online.
$C: Jijiji
$C: Lol...o
$C: jojojo lleg√≥ navidad
$C: Not funny, but "jajajaja" makes more sense to us.
$C: For Spanish natives, "hahahaha" is pronounced "a a a a"
$C: Hopes, dreams and bamboo?
$C: Jail isn't pun-ishment enough
$C: He talks in memes
$C: For a minute there... 
$C: Use a pun, go to jail.
$C: Tengo 31 llooolol
$C: Wow thanks for the in depth response!
$C: Because everyone knows Spanish
$C: There was more to it than that if you read the longer explaination above, I thought there was more to it that's all, but it's more of a cultural humor

Like I thought there was more to the joke than just a play on words
$C: Panda actually breed fairly well in the wild, just don't in captivity 
$C: If you get her drunk enough, then you will have no problem with breeding.
$C: Exotic forbidden taste. I think the young pandas would taste divine with some sweet and sour sauce 
$C: Wouldn't panda taste kinda shitty?  People don't really eat regular bears; I figure there's a reason (besides the liver being deadly).  
$C: I'd definitely eat one too.  I keep a list on my phone of animals that I've eaten and I would love to add panda to it.
$C: Lab grown meat is the future. All
We need is a muscle biopsy and we could have more lab grown panda muscle cells than real panda cells in no time. It‚Äôs panda meat without the panda. And the dude that did an AMA on the lab meat said that ground meat like taco meat is very easy to make in the lab, so we could do humane panda tacos, realistically in something like 10 years time. 
$C: In a similar vein, I once had szechuan reindeer in Finland.
$C: > but I'd eat a panda taco.

You may not get a panda taco but you can get a panza taco.
$C: Found Hannibal Buress.
$C: The panda might be easier to breed if you start eating their tacos first...
$C: Ya know that would be highly illegal right?
$C: Do you only eat animals that are easy to breed?
$C: ‚Ä¶Exactly what a panda would say‚Ä¶ 
$C: Username does not check out.

U good
$C: No green eggs and ham for you or my-shoo pork
$C: Hmm... I'd eat a bamboo shoot taco.... Maybe I'll try to make one. 
$C: Bamboo shoots are awesome.
$C: I went to a Korean taco place in NYC once. It was delicious. I'm sure Chinese and Mexican would also pair well. 
$C: Yeah, I hear it was a Chinese restaurant before that.
$C: Is the food any good? I'd love to go, but it is more than a 2 h drive
$C: Check out Ruby's Arcade if you go. Bomb-ass pizza and duckpin bowling, what more could you want?
$C: Like a military recruiter? A porn star recruiter? The term recruiter is very uh not specific.
$C: what type of gig?  i'm 20 minutes south of the burg
$C: I'm a physics tutor looking to find tutees anytime this year. If anyone needs help PM me.
$C: Oh yeah it still makes sense. I was just more surprised to see something in Harrisonburg I hadn't ever seen or heard of before even though I know the area well lol
$C: Jalisco is pretty good, it‚Äôs right near Macados, probably worth a visit. 
$C: It won't give me the shits due to high grease content.
$C: Their tea is amazing if you haven‚Äôt tried it. Also the buffet. And everything else. Also the staff is really friendly. I go there at least once a year even though I live 500 miles away! Having family nearby is just a bonus haha
$C: I‚Äôm in my senior year actually
$C: I had no idea. Good to know!
$C: Sounds yummy!
$C: 1Q & 7, white rice, black beans, more black beans, and that volcano cookie...now I need to drive across town.
$C: That's my order too, you clearly have great taste.
$C: I couldn't help but think theyd imagine it as a deep fried corn kernel Man. 
$C: In Mexico Kiko is a child from an 80's sitcom called "El Chavo"
$C: So... Popcornman.
$C: I look forward to the next netflix series this summer... 

Marvel's KikkoMan.
$C: Cocaine penis.

No, really...
$C: So you guys are telling me 

"Soy Soylent ~~Green~~ Verde?"
$C: That is indeed the correct translation. And if you then translate it literally back to English it says "I think, then I exist".
$C: Actually an even more correct translation is "Pienso, por lo tanto soy". (or "existo")
$C: I think therefore I exist?
$C: Entonces instead of luego but yeah 
$C: I like the way we've translated this in English. Technically, it's grammatically incorrect. One of the English professors where I went to school used to always say "you always have to have a direct object for am unless you are Descartes."

But just saying "I am" instead of "I exist" just sounds more poetic to me.
$C: Actually, I don‚Äôt think he was going for accuracy. 
$C: I think your translation is slightly wrong. Its more like "Yo Pienso, por lo tanto yo existo"

I might be wrong though. Neither translation sounds 100 percent right to me.
$C: Don't want to be that guy but technically is "Pienso, por lo tanto existo"
$C: looks like penis
$C: Pienso, por lo tanto existo.

You said ‚ÄúI think, I‚Äôll exist later.‚Äù
$C: [deleted]
$C: My Spanish is trash, but wouldn't the correct wording be: **Yo/Pienso, entonces debo ser!** Or **Yo/ Pienso, entonces soy**

**Pienso** : I think, since the direct translation would either fall under : **Yo pienso or Pienso**, since the actual translation literally is **Yo Pienso : I Think**, but figuratively the word alone implies **I think** altogether.

**Entonces debo ser** : So I must be, **entonces** translates to **therefore**. **Debo** : is a conjugation of **deber*** : must, **ser** translates to **to be**.

The other alteration is **entonces soy**, which literally translates **Therefore I am**, or short **I am**. 

Im my opinion the actual translation would fall more under, **Yo pienso, entonces debo ser!** 

Someone with an actual Spanish understanding please correct me.

Source: Native born Spanish speaker who is now a main English speaker.

P.S. Another user also posted: **Pienso, por lo tanto soy**. Which is also another alteration of my previous statement.

P.S.S. **You used Google translate didn't you xD**

$C: Phoenix, Arizona has a few.  

One of the more popular ones is called Chino Bandido.  
$C: My family and i are from Mexicali and went to Vegas last week, we enjoyed the tacos at Tacos el Gordo on the strip and the menudo at El Menudazo at Lake Mead Blvd, do you know of any other good mexican food places on LV?
$C: You're getting downvoted but as a Mexican living in the US, some of these people that say they like Mexican food would either hate eating at an actual traditional restaurant in Mexico or they'd get their mind blown by the quality upgrade in ambiance, presentation, and taste -- for much cheaper, too. Yeah, there's a lot of US-Mexican restaurants that rival their counterparts in Mexico but they're pretty hard to find. Those are way more common in Cali, Arizona, NM, Texas, and New York. I finally found one here in Iowa and I'm so happy I did.

$C: There are other less extreme stereotypes for black people, you know. You could've gone that route.
$C: I think people mix up the type of food with quality of food.
$C: I dont understand either. Like I hear how Taco Bells screws people a lot. But maybe because they probably haven't grown up on it to develop some kinda of resistance to whatever gives you the shits. I've been eating food with Valentina since I was a toddler. And where I work, I work with 40-50 yo, (white American, so idk if its their white American upbringing) guys. I pull out my small Valentina bottle and they ask "Geez, how can you just consume that like nothing." I just say I grew up with it,assuming I can probably take a ghost pepper like nothing. But eh, I don't know. 
$C: No, of course they are... But if left unchecked their numbers will grow... Like flat earthers or antivaxxers...
$C: Love those things. 
$C: Wow, flashback to my childhood :')
$C: Only one post in that sub. /u/Bombaskos should x-post.
$C: And the other two cacti 
$C: You do not know how long I spent looking for a mustache on that cactus before I realized what you meant.
$C: The cactus has a mustache?!?!?!  *Looks for several seconds*
$C: And the pandas.. Wait, what are we doing?
$C: No way. It used to be called China Inn and now it's the expanded location of El Sol, one of Harrisonburg's first authentic Mexican taco places. I grew up with the owners.
$C: The others don't have eyebrows so I would assume it was added post chinese place too.  The pigtails and flower crown is a nice touch, imo.
$C: And if you really zoom in, those eyebrows give her a VERY concerned look and it also appears as if she has googly eyes. 
$C: I could eat nopales for the rest of my life and be happy.

Greetings from Aguascalientes, friend. :)
$C: Those guys have a word for everything!
$C: Well the one the panda is holding still looks reeeeally small. So a vihuela would probably still be bigger than that. As you know, the guitarr√≥n would be bigger yet.
$C: I guess this might be a rare example of [Spexico](tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spexico).
$C: damn this is gettin spicy
$C: This is clearly the network comedy we need. 


$C: Isn't it possible she created the account in response to this being posted?
$C: Is that the name of the Mexican restaurant?
$C: I, painted, the sombreros.
$C: Nopales, pendejos
$C: ‚Äú...puckering some tight ani, *ain‚Äôt I*‚Äù

$C: Thats what he said
$C: Surprisingly difficult to pronounce
$C: Same.


But now I want an empanada. 

And I already ate 2 some hours ago.

What should I do?
$C: *el acero aprestad y el brid√≥n*
$C: Sorry, my cartoon viewing these days is limited to Luna Petunia, Trolls, and Disney Princess cartoons, as I‚Äôm almost 40 and have a 4 year old daughter. But after I watched that, I still don‚Äôt know what a Mexican touchdown is. So to me, I‚Äôm still going with: https://youtu.be/09DOG5V6lRs
$C: That‚Äôs actually fucking hilarious
$C: "Bowl of Rice" would certainly be a much more reasonable menu item :)
$C: The Jade Red Chicken in a quesadilla is heaven coated with melted cheese.
$C: Burrito is best.
$C: Well that and a pair of Browns tickets
$C: Yea I‚Äôm sure that many ungodly bodily solids and fluids indeed came out from your body
$C: its by accident

$C: Thanks. My colon intestines hate me. 
$C: What the fudge, lmao.
$C: Lol. I'm sure it is because of the Maltitol. I wonder why they don't use a different sugar alcohol such as xylitol or erythritol. I do the keto diet and neither of them make me sick.
$C: I live near a sprouts and it would be easy to set up the ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù drop off but I don‚Äôt have it in me. She‚Äôs annoying but I don‚Äôt hate her. 
$C: That‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt tried them yet lol
$C: I've never seen that product in Mexico so at most is a regional snack and possibly an US-only product.
$C: Elite rich guy: most of us aren't, and at least slighty resent those who are. (Therefore ironic)

$C: You're beautiful on the inside XD

$C: Those Scottish genes...
$C: I'm Ukrainian and Irish, I literally could not be whiter.
$C: English French Mexican worked very well for me. 
$C: me too!
$C: Don't feel bad you might be ugly AF, but you are also stupid
$C: I love how this thread is turning.
$C: Ahah, i would say I‚Äôm a above average. I‚Äôm lucky to be tall and I take care of myself
$C: It's Filipinos because they were also colonized by Spain and all have Spanish names too.
$C: Filipinos, because they throw the best parties in the neighborhood. 
$C: at the airport in Paris!
$C: Yep. 

I knew a couple a number of years ago where the man was Kurdish and the woman African-American. Their son was fucking drop dead handsome-- the jaw of an Adonis, magnificent hair, tall as hell, a constant smoldering look in his eyes. That dude must've been a regular walking heartbreaker.

Meanwhile, their daughter was just... not attractive. At all. She took almost every unattractive trait you could swing for. Huge forehead, deeply receded hairline, thin hair, eyes spaced far enough apart they didn't look right, lips thin as pinstripes... I could go on, but I think that's a pretty clear picture.
$C: Exactly this, I love my sister but she's one of the ugliest people I've ever seen :( 
$C: Yea inbreeding depression is a bitch, the unmasking of deleterious alleles results in some ugly ass albino babies
$C: > higher genetic variety has better odds of a good outcome

Isn't that just mostly concerning health, not beauty?
$C: Hybrid vigor ftw. Mixed race is the true master race. 
$C: Yes and no.  Certain hereditary diseases only require one parent to carry the allele to be passed on and activated...  you can easily get TWO hereditary diseases from TWO ethnic haplogroups if each of your parents carries such an allele.


$C: Yaaaarp?
$C: Yakety YAK!

$C: Looked there for a few minutes; no thanks, I prefer my reddit without vitriolic racism towards anyone thank you very much.

$C: Hey, I GET VIEWS (/s)

$C: don't apologize. i know there's plenty of hate on both sides. your story about movers doesnt surprise me at all. i have a chip on my shoulder. i know that.
$C: I second this. I live on the east side and things a pretty chill. I've heard parts of Long Beach can be trashy.

$C: These pandas would be made of tacos rather than bamboo.
$C: Y usas Pacman en Reddit.
$C: Right? This whole thread is making me feel like I‚Äôm lost in Mexico. 
$C: Not everybody, hence my explanation.
$C: It really is just a cultural humor. "Pendejo" is widely used in Mexico as "asshole." Paired with pandas in a highly improbable scene and you get a once in a lifetime pun, that was all.
$C: So if we get pandas to screw more often we get tacos? 
$C: Pandas become too depressed to breed aparently. They sad little bears.
$C: Well, I only eat wild caught panda, so we're all good.
$C: Problem with wild pandas is they don't survive very well in the wild and don't breed like rabbits. They didn't evolve to adapt to procuring and digesting a varied diet like bears or raccoons did. Instead they adapting to eating and digesting bamboo. It was ok when the weather was good, forestation plentiful, and there were only a few external threats to their survival. None of which are the case any more with humans impacting their habitat.

On the other hand, countless other animals have extinct. Meanwhile, Pandas will survive (willingly or not) because they evolved to look cute/cuddly (to humans) while their slow clumsy mannerisms also seem cute and adorable.
$C: There have literally been panda porn videos showing pandas how to mate.  They rarely mate 
$C: Oh boy, here we go again.
$C: We probably just have a bunch of ugly fuckin pandas, so they don't wanna bang.
$C: Need Panda ranches for free range Panda then. 
$C: In captivity they have to watch panda porn.
$C: Is there any research done into how they breed in reserves/are there any reserves available for pandas? 
$C: Concur. A couple I know is having a hard time. 
$C: If that's true, how come there's so many efforts to breed them in captivity? Is it just a matter of they breed well in the wild, but not well enough so they would go extinct, and we're trying to just  make that not happen? Just curious, thought you might know!
$C: Tacos don‚Äôt breed well at all though. 
$C: I don't think I'll breed well in captivity as well...
$C: This is not true at all. Pandas almost only breed in captivity. Google Panda Porn ..
$C: I‚Äôve had black bear. It‚Äôs delicious.
$C: *I got ya plug on some of that Panda, fam.*
$C: Hmmm, but would it really be? They're not an endangered species in US law and I can't find a law about slaughtering pandas. Probably smuggling your breeding pair in would be the biggest hurdle
$C: They only breed with animals that are easy to eat why?
$C: Damn exposed 
$C: Too many Bamboo shoot up.  Heroin addicts
$C: Yea, they had pandas on their murals

^(Bleep-bloop, I'm a bot. This )^[portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) ^( was created from the phrase 'Sounds yummy!'. To learn more about me, check out this )^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/78ilq0).
$C: ¬†¬° Soy loco por los Cornballs!
$C: Well, *I* do, but I'm weird :P
$C: Kikkohombre
$C: Deep fried man kernels...
$C: ¬°Soylent Verde es gente!

$C: "Luego" should still be translated as "therefore", that "luego" is more a "por lo tanto/por eso/gracias a eso" than a "despu√©s/entonces".

As a really old philosophical phrase it uses the fifth meaning [here](http://dle.rae.es/?id=Ng77N8B) instead of the others.
$C: [deleted]
$C: [deleted]
$C: Yup this one is good.
$C: [deleted]
$C: "Luego", though it's not the same than "por lo tanto" or "entonces", shares some meaning similarities with those two, and when we hear this phrase, it's got that fixed form 'pienso, luego existo'. Even in philosophy classes we were taught it that way. (Spanish is my first language)
$C: Yeah, technically it is but, you know, more often than not phrases are not translated directly, specially in these fixed cases where you quote somebody else.
$C: It is not wrong. 'Pienso, luego existo' is   translated from latin. 
$C: They are translating it from the Latin text, NOT from english.
$C: If you translate it from English, then yeah but since it's translated from Latin, the best or precise translation is "pienso, luego existo".  The literal translation from Latin would be, "pienso, por lo tanto soy."
$C: {-}7
$C: Is there a TIFU after this?
$C: Ja also means yes in Dutch and some other languages
$C: The J in Spanish has the same sound as the H in harry, so "jajaja" is how you laugh in spanish...however ,in japan, when people wanna write that they're laughing, they use "WWWWWWWWW"  which is the first sound of the word warau/warai which means laughter.
$C: Welcome to US English and UK English, how may I direct your call?

$C: I will never read soy sauce the same way again.
$C: Que?
$C: [deleted]
$C: I like El gordos, but I hate their line system. If you want asada, and pastor, that‚Äôs two lines you have to make. And by the time you pay, your tacos are cold. =( 

On the lucky chance I get to have their food warm, those tacos are great! 

I actually have never heard of ‚ÄúEl Menudazo‚Äù and I‚Äôm gonna have to give it a try now! Thanks for that tip!!!

Mmmhmmmm.... I would definitely try out ‚ÄúEl Dorado‚Äù Mexican Cantina. It‚Äôs a Mexican restaurant next to Sapphire‚Äôs Strip Club. It‚Äôs delicious. The chef is from Mexico City. All his products are organic and pesticide/antibiotic free. 

Honestly, the Mexican food here in Las Vegas isn‚Äôt the best. There are so many tourists here from all over the world, that the food tends to be compromised in order to suit the taste of international clients :(
$C: Everyone knows the best Mexican food is served out of a truck. That‚Äôs my go to check for quality. Double points if it‚Äôs not even a food truck 
$C: That would make it okay?
$C: You might be very right.
$C: I think you‚Äôre probably onto something in part. I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúgrow up‚Äù eating Taco Bell, per se, but we ate it once a month or so. And my mom loves spicy food, especially super hot Mexican food, so I got a taste of that, too. 

I guess I don‚Äôt order beans things at Taco Bell, though, so maybe that‚Äôs the issue. The Chinese thing baffles me, though. American Chinese food is the easiest thing to eat in the world!
$C: plus girl panda has "La india Maria" braids (classical Mexican comedy character)

$C: Holy shit this mural really does keep on giving. 
$C: Where is this Harrisonburg you speak of
$C: I meant his title is misleading because it wasn't just sombreros added. 
$C: They also seem to be mexican
$C: I would literally live off tuna (the fruit, not the fish) if I could. Hello from Tlaxcala!
$C: Alternatively, maybe they just make it look small. They are bears after all. Could be bigger than it seems.
$C: It‚Äôll be spicy at both ends if you know what I mean
$C: Two Girls, 1 Mural, and a Whole Lot of Mexican Food.

$C: Hahah acceptable. Did you enjoy bravest warriors? I found it 3-4 years ago and it always entertains me. 

$C: No, they just put it in a tortilla with nothing else. Quesadilla is the best. 
$C: no thread is safe
$C: Geez, you gotta really have it in for someone to give them that.
$C: If they eat those sugar free gummies they *will* be taking the Browns to the Superbowl, if you catch my drift. 
$C: I‚Äôll take free football tickets I don‚Äôt care who‚Äôs playing. 
$C: You may not like them but that's going a little bit into torture territory.
$C: Nah, just one ticket. He's gotta go by himself.
$C: The horror. 
$C: it is is it's not its
$C: There are more.... Oh so many more.
$C: I'd recommend an exorcism before trying these to solve your poop problems. I love your enthusiasm though. 
$C: Negrito Bimbo? (Now called Nito) It‚Äôs in every Oxxo / convenience store / supermarket in the country and has been for the past 20 years at least. My coworker buys them at least once a week. Or are you talking about the ‚ÄúEl Japo‚Äù? Lol because I haven‚Äôt seen that one either. 
$C: I'm Mexican and I've seen that product, specifically that one.
$C: Meh, I don't mind being stereotypically portrayed as rich even if I am not, and all vast majority of cultures respect warriors and don't mind being portrayed as such. Beats being s slant eyed rice farmer with a straw conical hat.
$C: That's where the delicious meat is.
$C: Why is he a sheep? Haha i kid I kid, you‚Äôre not welsh. 
$C: Well, until like 75 years ago most people wouldn't have considered you white at all.

$C: >Meanwhile, their daughter was just... not attractive. At all. She took almost every unattractive trait you could swing for.

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, my friend. I just got wood from your description alone.


$C: Found my bio boyz
$C: That‚Äôs a hell of a sentence.
$C: I understand all of those words separately.
$C: [Mhm](https://i.imgur.com/dPIKefN.jpg)
$C: Yeah but a lot of the traits we consider attractive are indicators of good health so they‚Äôre not completely unrelated. 
$C: I get it, but in my in experience, just adding to the average hotness of people in Hawaii, it's also a Mecca of Fineness. I know a handful of people who've moved there. A few older couple, parent's friends, several model types and a cougar realtor

[Pandas are bears, though.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda#Classification)
$C: Well, considering the female can only conceive once a year, for a single 24-36 hour period, and they average 1 cub every 2 years, humans are vastly outpacing them in population growth.
$C: Koalas are the same way, with eucalyptus.  Their lives revolve around it.  This may sound heartless, but I sometimes wonder if we should just let Darwin do his thing for some of these species.
$C: Honestly, fuck pandas. Let's stop the desperate efforts to prop up an incompetent species and put that money towards looking after ones that don't completely suck at life, like rhinos and snow leopards and shit. If pandas wanted to keep existing they should have evolved better. They're not even that cute, they always look like they're on benzos or something.
$C: They just haven't figure out what kind of porn they really like watching. 
$C: ...In captivity.  It's not like Pandas are the only animals that don't really breed well in captivity.  I mean, for example, there's a reason why we still have fishing boats instead of just raising all the fish we eat on a farm.
$C: There is
$C: Problem is 'in the wild'. Humans have more or less paved or cut down most of the wild.
$C: Then how the fuck do they survive in the wild

You're from Vector Marketing, aren't you?
$C: *Estoy 

Soy = permanent state of being
Estoy = temporary state of being 
First person, of course. 
$C: Spanish has two verbs for "to be". In this case instead of using soy, you must use estoy.
$C: Oh. I see that you're kinda that guy. That guy who makes jokes like that. 
$C: ¬øQu√©?
$C: The low sodium soy salsa?
$C: SOYLENT GR√úN IST MENSCHEN! 
$C: ¬°Tiempo para QUESEDILLAS!
$C: Apparently the Spanish dub of *Soylent Green* is titled *"Cuando el destino nos alcance"* ("When destiny reaches us"), however Soylent Green (the food) is left untranslated in the movie itself.
$C: It's the correct translation from the Latin expression "cogito ergo sum."

Why would you translate it from Latin yo English to Spanish though? 
$C: It is the correct translation in Spanish.
$C: Well my native language is Spanish and "Pienso, luego existo" is as common in Spanish as "I think, therefore I am" is in English. Both are the only translations I have heard in either language of Descartes' original quote.
$C: He literally said it was a literal translation.
$C: "Guy above" ( /u/John_Enigma ) is correct. But also is /u/AerialAmphibian

Source: https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito_ergo_sum

Also source: Native spanish speaker.
$C: Actually,  "Pienso, luego existo" is a valid translation from "Cogito ergo sum"
$C: You're obviously the one who doesn't know Spanish if you think that's Google translate, it isn't, it's a non-literal translation that sounds better in Spanish and the one that's always used by native speakers.
$C: I did not know that! Thanks for the information. Spanish is my first language, but oddly enough I have better English grammar.
$C: But it definitely changes the meaning, if one says "pienso, luego existo" it means that first I think then I exist,  but in the case of "pienso, por lo tanto existo" it means that since I think I must exist, which was Rene Descartes intention.

$C: A few nights ago Rory's Roger iron's rusted. He's gone down the battle-cruiser to watch the end of a football game. Nobody is watching the custard so he turns the channel over. A fat geezer's north opens. He wanders up and turns the liza over. 'Now fuck off and watch it somewhere else.' Rory knows claret is imminent, but he doesn't want to miss the end of the game. So, calm as a coma, picks up a fire extinguisher, walks straight past the jam rolls who are ready for action and he plonks it outside the entrance. He then orders an Aristotle of the most ping pong tiddly in the nuclear sub and switches back to his footer. 'That's fucking it,' says the geezer. 'That's fucking what?' says Rory. And he gobs out a mouthful of booze covering fatty. He flicks a flaming match into his bird's nest and the geezer's lit up like a leaking gas pipe. Rory, unfazed, turned back to his game. His team's won too. Four-nil.
$C: Now beat it.
$C: Guey 
$C: Nah mate it‚Äôs despacito, despacio works too but it‚Äôs also acceptable. Maybe not terribly correct, but you can use it as an adjective.

Source: speak Spanish naturally
$C: That too, for sure, but that's mostly for tacos, tortas, or elotes. Basically Mexican fast food, which is delicious as well.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Surprised it took this long for someone to notice.
$C: lol thats the first thing I noticed too! My uncle used to call me La india Maria. 
$C: You take my life into somewhere I can't describe
$C: AND MY AXE
$C: Virginia. We've got JMU and Kline's ice cream here too. 
$C: I see.
$C: If I were to pick a fruit, it would be *mamey* for me.

The most delicious thing in the universe.

And sadly, extremely hard to get in non-tropical areas. :/
$C: You're right, maybe I exaggerated with the emphasis on "really".
$C: Do you think?

Or should I go for the safe option and wait till tomorrow and eat 2.
$C: I disagree, no reason to mess up that delicious sauce with cheese.
$C: The only way the browns will make it to superbowl

$C: Honestly, spending my lunch reading those comments. Brb ü§£üòÇ
$C: Good to know. 
$C: I was talking about the sh'uh-ri-tous :laughs in Spanish:
$C: Where?
$C: Yeah, ok. But how else would you like us represented? The fallout guy?

How did, say, the japanese equalent of cartoonists draw white men at the last part of the 10th century?
$C: We should get jackets and meet to talk about animal sex 
$C: Not as hellish as outbreeding depression, those poor lonely fucks are too dissimilar to fuck! Damn conservationists should a brought a geneticist 
$C: Inbreeding depression is when mating with related individuals raised the probability of the child/progeny having a 'bad' effect; such as albinism which could make them more prone to predation/early death.

Outbreeding depression is when a conservationist introduces a new individual to a group that is doing poorly/small/verge of extinction/low diversity in order to increase diversity, but the new individual is too dissimilar to either mate, or they do mate, but there genetics don't rescue the old line. 

Biology is about FUCKING TBH

$C: kkkkkkkk
$C: Five is pronounced ha in thai, so self explanatory.  Used like lol

Not to be confused with chinese people typing 555555, which is used the same way but with opposite meaning since its pronounced wu and is a crying sound.  
$C: Actually, yeah that was way more common now that I think about it. It was mostly a rival Linkshell (clan/guild for you non-FFXI folk) that would spam KKKKKKKKKK. But all the JP randos would stick to w.
$C: Rs is short for ‚Äúrisos,‚Äù which means ‚Äúlaughs‚Äù
$C: I would say it is more like "tsss tsss tsss tsss" like that laughing through your teeth kinda sound. I've also heard its more of a generational thing determining if you use rsrsrs or kkkkk
$C: and what the heck is a henge?
$C: And to think that I confused femur with tibia in a PE test
$C: Seriously. I played from 7.1 up until 8.6, then played heavily on OTservs for years. Legitimately about 10 years playing. Got out of OTserv and took a break for a while, then went back and started playing again about two years ago on my very original character (where I get my username from!). Played for about two weeks before my account was hacked and I lost everything, including items that you can't get anymore, etc. I was so upset. Haven't touched it since.

$C: Ecstasy Panda Farms??? Take My Money!!!!
$C: Hi bear. I'm twink. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
$C: Quiet rammus.
$C: Thats in the wild. Wild pandas were not having sex. Captive pandas are actually really happy, so much so that they have been having so much sexy that they are no longer critically endangered.
$C: They did evolve to look cute.  That doesn't necessarily imply any deliberate intent.  They *just happened* to evolve to look cute.  But that's true of all evolution, it *just happens* to go a certain way, and then that way happens to be advantageous rather than deleterious.

Which is an odd, but still valid, form of Darwinism.  Cuteness is an evolutionary advantage because it encourages a kind of commensalism with humans.  We protect them while they provide us no real evolutionary benefit.  So over time, hypothetically, animals would evolve to become cuter overall.

Just like humans are evolving to be better looking, even if we're not becoming more biologically robust.
$C: rhinos suck at life???
$C: You definitely have the right idea. All the amount of money China has spent on Panda conservation could be used to save many other endangered species. We're only putting so much money and effort in them because they're cute and cuddly. I mean, if they can't be forced to breed maybe that's a sign that we should move on?
$C: I guess I shouldn't tell you about the breeding efforts of French Bulldogs...
$C: PDSM
$C: Oh!! Did not expect that! That's really sad to hear :( thanks for the reply tho
$C: >Then how the fuck do they survive in the wild

Not to take from your point but the whole reason for them being in captivity is that they don't :D 
$C: Sperm bank, duh
$C: The goggles do nothing. 
$C: Paint a picture of a wall and have the American people pay for it. 
$C: I think we're both in too deep. I'm heading for the country and lying low for a while. I suggest you do the same.
$C: Haha, no. Just a recruiter browsing reddit at work seeing mention of a hard to fill location that I will be hiring for in the near future and just seeing what pops up from reddit. Also if my boss ever checks my browser history and asks why I spend so much time on reddit I can point here and say its another recruitment tool lol.
$C: Probably Vandelay Industries.
$C: That's the first company to pop into my head as well.
$C: Perhaps he/she IS permanently loco for cornballs...
$C: Hey thanks! I know ashamedly little about languages other than mine. :) 
Also, I'll admit that this was a blatant copy/paste from Imdb.com so I'd get the quote right. ;) 
That being said, you helped me learn something new today, so again, thank you!

$C: Username checks out. 
$C: U dum? He translated to American first am then to Mexican .
$C: This literally makes no sense
$C: [deleted]
$C: [deleted]
$C: *changes hahaha for jajaja*
$C: As I pointed out before, "luego" has a similar meaning to "por lo tanto", and as a native speaker (not trying to be condescending, it's just that for a native speaker things sound different) it definitely keeps the cause-consequence relationship, at least for me and for the vast majority of people I know.
$C: The literal translation from english does not mean the same.
$C: No need, as the original phrase isn't an English one.

You're claiming that he used Google Translate and I was simply clarifying that he was using the correct Spanish translation for the original quote. 

If anything it is on you to demonstrate that he is using Google Translate or the *correct* Spanish translation is "broken gibberish."

Pretend like I said "they are 'likely' translating from the Latin text" if it makes you feel better.


$C: I met her and she has the classic tanned, brunette beautiful Spanish girl look. She was a foot and a half smaller than me but I quickly over looked it. We had drinks and I went back to her flat, then we started kissing and she had HORRIBLE breath. And then I looked at her teeth and they were filthy. I got the next train home, I couldn‚Äôt handle it. 

So no, there is no TIFU, just a SFU. 
$C: I'm just pointing out a double standard. I don't agree with any of these stereotypes or hatred.
$C: are we going to ignore the fact that it has as desert landscape with some mountains like mexico, which is probably painted over a jungle, which is where the pandas live(d)
$C: One of the first things I noticed, am Mexican though
$C: Should‚Äôve known this was coming 
$C: Well that's another state/country on a long list of places to go eat. 
$C: Kline's....OMG I miss Kline's...

$C: Do you think?

Or should I go for the ~~safe option~~ boring option and wait till tomorrow and eat 2?*

Fixed That For You 


$C: You have misread my sentence. What I stated was:
'it is' is it's not its
or alternatively: 
"it is" ~~is~~ *contracts to* it's not its
$C: I don't know man, somewhere around Delicias or Chihuahua city, I do remember that logo and the name, but I can't pinpoint the oxxo or tiendita de la esquina where I saw it.
$C: Hmmm....if you insist something as degrading, I wouldn't mind an obese redneck wearing a wifebeater holding a can of beer sitting on a motorized stroller with a MAGA cap on....
$C: Thank you for helping me better understand. You're a good teacher.
$C: Badgerbadgerbadgerbadger
$C: i got broads in atlanta
$C: Holy shit, that's from 2015? HOW OLD AM I?
$C: I kinda hate the fact that desiigner has grown on me.
$C: *desiigner noises" I got broads in Atlanta
$C: Here's your shameless like
$C: Nice
$C: No thank you 
$C: donde esta la biblioteca
$C: ou "Way to go dude"
$C: Thank you
$C: Ah, that makes sense. Thanks for the explanation! Funny about Chinese usage being the opposite. 
$C: Maybe they were Koreans? KKK = „Öã„Öã„Öã (though it's sometimes written as kekeke)
$C: w
$C: Oh ok so it‚Äôs like lololololol?
$C: yep 15 years later "rs" was a big thing, now the "kkkkk" took over together with other international laughs like "lol"
$C: Fuck that sucks. How'd you get hacked?!
$C: I just realized I grew up listening to that song but I'd never seen the girl singing it. This brought back tons of memories.
$C: Queonda we.

Das pena man... 
$C: Sorry I instantly assumed the worst. You're a good guy.
$C: No but I'm pretty sure zoos use panda porn to get their juices flowing.

$C: Come on. If you had a panda farm wouldn't ecstacy be your general condition in life?

Til harvest time, anyway.
$C: /r/nocontext seems to work here haha
$C: Give it a couple of years and we'll stop becoming more beautiful as the need for that stops with the VR sales rocketing.
$C: Well, they suck at not getting killed by poachers but that's not exactly their fault. 
$C: His point I think is that in the game of life where the point is to spread your genes as much as possible,  and that pandas aren‚Äôt as good as other animals at accomplishing that.
$C: Their horns make you a sex god
$C: The assumption here is that if those funds weren‚Äôt directed to pandas they‚Äôd be directed to other endangered species. This isn‚Äôt necessarily true. People put money towards things they like. People like pandas. As sad as it is to lose some rare species of bird and frog and worm, they‚Äôll just never be as popular as the panda. 
$C: Oh yeah, animals that are physically incapable of giving birth without a C-section (and increasingly reliant on artificial insemination too) definitely need to die out. Frenchies and bulldogs are adorable, sure, but let's not bring any more of them into the world. 
$C: That's thanks to us humans fucking up their habitat, though. Pandas have survived fine in the wild for millions of years before hominids, let alone humans, were ever even around. If breeding were really such a big issue for them, the only Panda we'd have ever seen would have been a fossil.
$C: On the contrary they do... but humans fancy the panda's home

$C: I think you should put an /s before you're downvoted to oblivion, unless you aren't joking.
$C: Only for the figuratively illiterates.
$C: Both are correct. One is "a more accurate translation".
$C: That link says the other translation is more *accurate*, not that it sounds better. It doesn't, there's a reason "Pienso, luego existo" is often used (*like the article itself said at the start*.) I am a native Spanish speaker so I think I would know a bit about that.

Also, your original comment was trying to say it was a shitty Google Translate, but you not only linked to a Spanish article that uses it but also linked to a Google search for the translation of the words...
$C: [deleted]

$C: I don't know what role the panda plays in the ecosystem, but I do wonder if there are other species that are literally "more valuable" in an ecological sense. 
$C: Username does not check out. Unless, that is, if animal extinction is your fetish. 
$C: It has a lot more to do with their (lack of) diet. Without human intervention these "bears" would have died out. Their biggest evolutionary achievement is their coloration which makes them cute enough to garner enough attention from humans 
$C: Pandas shouldn't be so bloody picky!

$C: maybe the Panda's just know they are being watched and think it's very unchill.
$C: Another comment in this thread was put there
$C: Bees?
$C: So you think Pandas would have died out because of an inherent flaw in their diet, a diet which they adapted to over the millions of years they survived just fine, but luckily for them they were saved by humans deciding to save them *this century*?  
  
Pandas diet's are fine. They found an evolutionary niche in food that's low in nutrients but is abundant, has little competition for it, and doesn't run away. What other animals have a lack of diet if low-nutrient high-volume ones don't count. Cows? Koalas? But I suppose people think Pandas aren't *supposed* to eat bamboo, they should eat meat like *proper* bears. A great point I'll contemplate while consuming my much more natural diet of cheese and soda.
$C: No exactly why is their diet hard to find now days? Human intervention. Their biggest evolutionary achievement in my eyes is that they have a wrist bone that acts as an opposable thumb, that is big.
$C: Despacito
$C: Help, i think my Reddit turned Spanish and I can't figure out how to change the language settings back 
$C: I got the joke, just wanted to point out. Don't be mean :C
$C: You're doubting I'm a native speaker because I disagree with you? Anyway the thing we were arguing in the first place is your claim that "Pienso, luego existo" being a translation native speakers wouldn't use, which just isn't true. I admit the other is more exactly accurate, but what almost all Spanish language books and such use is isn't that one, and "Pienso, por lo tanto soy" definitely doesn't sound natural to Spanish speakers.
$C: Same here. I grew up along the U.S. border, so I am familiar with some "Mexican stuff" but not everything.  
$C: Whats a maga cap?

 What does a redneck face look like? Red nosed, blue eye and unshaven?
$C: Snaaaaaake! 
$C: They have to spend 15+ hours a day just eating. 
$C: Their diet is bamboo which has low nutrients. It does not support healthy living. In fact new born pandas don't gain sight for 3 months of age. They don't have enough nutrition to support a healthy libido 
$C: DESACTIVA EL MODO VIVA LA REVOLICION
$C: I'm from the border too, but my parents were the first to immigrate so we still have a lot of family on the other side, and we, our family, lived on the other side too, and everyone still speaks Spanish and at my  mom's we still watch Spanish television and eat tamales during the holidays. 
$C: Just use Trump's face squinting with is tongue out. Put a red Make America Great Again hat on it. Perfection....
$C: As opposed to what? Learning to play the piano? Are pandas actually musical savants that just never have a chance to put their talent into practice because of their busy schedule? I was always pretty convinced that animals generally don't really do much besides eating,  
  
And it's not like a predator like a lion just snaps its claws and it suddenly it has food. Hunting also takes time, and a lot more energy than just meandering through the forest eating bamboo. Not to mention the potential of another predator stealing their meal. No such problem for pandas.  
  


$C: It actually does support a healthy lifestyle, pandas need a lot of bamboo to sustain themselves on this diet, and therefore need a large habitat to have a healthy life. But what we do in zoos is shove them into a much smaller habitat. Now pandas avoid breeding if it seems their habitat can't sustain more pandas (it's a bit more complicated involving hormones and etc). If their habit is small it gives off the impression that their offspring will not survive, so why breed if the off spring will die?
