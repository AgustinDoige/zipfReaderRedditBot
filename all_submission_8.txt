I took a few shots at Lake Louise today and Google offered me this panorama:

$C: Its really messing with my head how well your face blends into the picture. Google's got skill.

You mean google took your pictures, made this panorama and offered it to you without you even ask? Did we reach this level of technology already?
$C: Since it was dark at the time of posting, when were you actually there? How were conditions?
$C: Welp, time to get my ass behind Wall Maria.
$C: AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH
$C: Now I understand how giants appeared in Norse mythology

$C: SHOW ME WHAT TOU GOT!!!
$C: What is this? A ski slope for ants?
$C: This is actually funny, it doesn't belong here

The guy in the photo is u/team_swilly and I will post proof that it was Google and not Photoshop, along with the photos it must have used in an edit to this comment when i get better WiFi!
$C: Did google combine two photos? I'm trying to understand what the hell happened here and how I can get google to do this for me.

$C: Ok Google make me really big!

*childish giggling*

The trees are my mustache brush now
$C: Hello...

$C: /r/confusing_perspective
$C: It's an omen. When Google's AI gains sentience it will strive to replace everyone's lower bodies with trees.

Now we know it's master plan.
$C: Why and how google would do this kind of things offering something
$C: Now even I understand why we need AI in Phones
$C: I'm jealous.  That picture is awesome
$C: Free photoshop!
$C: Me before clicking: "Yeah, we know Google Assistant tries to make animations and panos - it's not all that good, why would they share this?"

$C: Wow, so Google totally cut out the lake. That sucks. 
$C: "Here comes that guuuuuy!!!"
$C: Google really upgraded your panorama 
$C: Just wait until summer to skip the fight 
$C: We all remember where we were, the day the walls fell... The day the Titans arrived.
$C: It's amazing how nature does that.
$C: Maybe due to a time travel mishap you parents didn’t meet.
$C: Majestic AF
$C: Giant skier 
$C: This is a pretty cool picture though... I love it

$C: FINALLY Google has proven its value!

$C: Lake Louise is really nice right now! Not super cold but the snow is falling!
$C: Sasquatch is real! Take that, doubters!
$C: You should get that printed and framed. 
$C: /r/imaginarybehemoths

$C: I'm afraid all this karma has given you a big head
$C: It looks like some sort of ski enthusiast-esque giant is emerging from the woods.

$C: Reminds me of the April fool's Google did where they photoshopped David hasslehof into everything 
$C: Attack on Titan
$C: It's too early to be laughing this hard
$C: That is the single best thing I’ve seen all day. Thanks, OP!
$C: Those google elves have a unique sense of humor!
$C: You look like Ant-Man practicing for the move he pulled in Captain America: Civil War.

**Ant-Man:** "I got something kind of big, but I can't hold it very long. On my signal, run like hell and if I tear myself in half, you don't come back."

**Iron Man:** "Okay, anybody on our side hiding any shocking and fantastic abilities they'd like to disclose? I'm open to suggestions."

$C: Whatever you do don't post this to /r/skiing they will say you are riding out of control. 
$C: "Show me what you got!"
$C: reminds me of those mountain men commercials
$C: What mountain is the one with the goggles?
$C: I love this so much. It's art - if you had made it in photoshop you'd be a visionary
$C: A rare Sasquatch siting. 
$C: How is that mountain, are the conditions usually power like or groomed hard packed snow/granular ice?
$C: [̲̅H][̲̅E] [̲̅E][̲̅M][̲̅E][̲̅R][̲̅G][̲̅E][̲̅S]

$C: Nah, this is augmented reality ;) 
$C: Great guess who is going to have a Yeti nightmare tonight!
$C: He accends
$C: Wow, I like the rule of thirds being used here.
$C: [All I think of when I see this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LGTEI1RMoQ)
$C: Not sure it's big enough.
$C: It is hard to run away in snowshoes.
$C: Magrite.

$C: That what I feel like every time I ski behind the trees to pee. 
$C: Weird
$C: Look it’s a giant he is trying to hide but is failing very badly.
$C: SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT!
$C: Instant classic. Get it printed and framed.
$C: I would frame this.
$C: Majestic!
$C: i really am confused by this post. OP took a few shots at Lake Louise? Searches or took photos... And google offered OP that panorama? So he searched ....  please don't downvote me for the confusion!
$C: Too bad you weren't skiing at Panorama
$C: Show me what you got!
$C: Offered, and accepted.

$C: This is amazing actually
$C: Oh hello! Welcome to my mountain!
$C: I don't get it?
$C: is this even a panorama? it seems like google just wanted the opportunity to hide a giant snowboarder in some trees
$C: Most concerning to me is the reflection of the Night King in the guy's goggles. 
$C: And here I thought Sasquatch was hard to spot!
$C: It’s telling you to be one with the mountain. Or that you are. 
$C: Glorious. 
$C: “I am the mountain” 
$C: There's something weird in the middle...

I saw him once before actually, the google maps car went by and I saw someone across the street take a photo, obviously that must have been Mr. Google, taking the street view photos. I expect they came back later and picked him up, after he was done spinning round really fast with his camera to get the 360 views.

$C: Hill giants are real shit. Don’t play around!!
$C: I watched someone try to ride thru him and never come out the other side
$C: He is one with the trees.
$C: it must be your last shots 
$C: You know you're in college when you read the title and thought you went out drinking
$C: Lol that's awesome!!!
$C: Think we just found Paul Bunyan's descendant.
$C: Watch out! It's a Sentinel! 
$C: Unintentional photoshop. 
$C: WHATS THIS? A LAKE FOR ANTS???
$C: Giant step.
$C: Attack on Snowboarder. How did he make it past the walls?
$C: This is r/oldpeoplefacebook profile photo material.
$C: Hahhhahh
$C: I thought you were standing behind a mini forest

$C: BOW TO ME...FOR I AM A GOD!
$C: /r/hmmm
$C: GIANTS!!!!!!
$C: Jesus christ, that's Jason Bourne! 
$C: This is how the god of skiing appears 
$C: It's beaitiful! 
$C: Fajita of the slopes. 
$C: Show me what you got! 
$C: The stuff they're doing to make water towers blend in with the surroundings these days...
$C: A meme machine in the makings. OMG.
$C: No amount of Photoshop could achieve this 
$C: Sweet album cover.
$C: I'm shook
$C: r/ImaginaryBehemoths/ 
$C: There’s giants in them hills...
$C: Google Assistant will occasionally add effects to images I take to make them look more interesting. Recently, it added effects to a photo it had already added effects to, leading to [this weirdness](https://i.imgur.com/39YtoHd.jpg) 

Edit: For some reason, this picture doesn't look as saturated and funky on my monitor as it does on my phone.
$C: SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT!!!
$C: I love it, thanks.
$C: I burst out laughing in the shower. this is magical.
$C: I'll take it
$C: This was not taken today.
$C: !dreambot5

$C: That’s Brody, God of the Powder and Lord of Snowboarding. He’s just there to make sure you’er having a wicked time, Brah. 
$C: Damn Google u scary.
$C: ARISE as the legends foretold
$C: Your model looks amazing. What kind of train are you putting in? 
$C: r/bossfights 
$C: Taste THESE Rockies, bitch!
$C: Thats a really big guy
$C: Just needs a power plant and hogarth.
$C: Oh hi, I just upgraded your board
$C: SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOOOOOOOOT!
$C: Taking a line from an R Kelly song too seriously. Which are you though? The mountain? Or the tall tree? 
$C: It's actually pretty nice
$C: *Cue Final Boss Music*
$C: He approaches...
$C: Those branches should hold off your hunger till help arrives Paul! 
$C: Jesus how big must be your camera
$C: Looks like grim reminder
$C: Album cover definitely 
$C: Damn that drunk off a few shots?
$C: Reminds me of Kilroy
$C: Very Funny!
$C: run
$C: Pretty much rules. 
$C: Like a Telletubies sun
$C: Huh? there are trees in the background 
$C: /r/megalophobia 
$C: Look! A yeti!
$C: Shots of what? Whiskey? Tequila?
$C: Brilliant
$C: *Attack on Titan's intro starts playing*
$C: Reminds me of that south park episode with Scott the giant dick
$C: Big Foot
$C: Looks like the Iron Giant peaking out from the trees.
$C: And I hope you took this and hung it on your mantle “the snow king”
$C: Can't help but feel that this is both hilarious and concerning at the same time. 
$C: Re re return the map return what you have stolen from me 
$C: Well, I've been waiting for Attack on Titan Season 3 for a while now.
$C: Now when you say shots...
$C: Snow me what you got!
$C: HE COMES
$C: The real question is... Are you big enough?
$C: Soon...
$C: Now you’re one with nature 
$C: Nailed it!
$C: Show me what you got!
$C: Cherish this for all eternity...
$C: I thought it was a mini town for a second 
$C: How is Lake Louise?! My lift ticket this season includes two days at that mountain and I’m deciding whether or not I should make the trip.
$C: t's so... beautiful
$C: That's Scott, he's a dick
$C: It’s in the spirit of a Star Wars dvd cover 
$C: Lool best panorama ever!!!
$C: Nice try, mountain giant
$C: How do you get your Imgur linked pics to scale to full screen rather than a thumbnail off to the side?
$C: On that day, humanity received a grim reminder... 
$C: Great. I laughed out loud in the office. This is too good.
$C: Oh hi benevolent ruler
$C: What is this?! A ski slope for ants?!
$C: Love Lake Louise!
$C: I've drifted there.
$C: I didn't realize we were in the hall of the mountain king
$C: He’s a mountain of a man. 
$C: The keeper of the mountain
$C: I LIKE WHAT YOU'VE GOT!
$C: This made me laugh in real life.
$C: Looks like you just got a new sick profile pic! #ThanksGoogle
$C: Please, won't someone reference the iron giant
$C: That's definitely a keeper.
$C: This is too great!
$C: All your lakes are belong to us
$C: jesus, you look like the walrus from Pingu's nightmare.
$C: [I'm having flashbacks](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/pingu/images/1/1b/GIANT_WALRUS.png/revision/latest?cb=20140619072421)
$C: This new season of AoT looks amazing.
$C: That's the perfect profile picture if I ever saw one. 
$C: You are a big guy!
$C: Stomped!
$C: This is real art. Thanks google
$C: r/Bossfight
$C: Remind me of that terrifying Pingu episode.
$C: That's a sick slope, the goggles look sketchy though
$C: Something similar has happened to me... https://imgur.com/M89t0VR I'm the reverse headless horseman!
$C: Very Pythonesque 
$C: Become the wilderness 
$C: Just for the laughs alone, that's worthy of printing out and framing.
$C: he watches us all
$C: Print it. Frame it. Put it up.
$C: Is that the legendary big foot?
$C: So basically, the real world version of [AHHHHHHH](https://youtu.be/yBLdQ1a4-JI)
$C: Looks like the Titans have discovered winter clothing, nowhere is safe!
$C: Welp.. Someone prepare the Megazords. 
$C: For a second there I thought this was a miniature showcase!
$C: Your own personal Mount Rushmore.  Everyone should have one.
$C: There are some other rather large people taking the picture in the reflection of his goggles! What is this mystic land!
$C: Why does it say google offered me this? He take the pic on a Google phone?
$C: ...Big Enough?
$C: The Man Beyond the Pines 
$C: my dude looking like obito uchia
$C: wat
$C: Few shots of what? Jäger?
$C: Dat giant creepin’ hard rn. 
$C: Tomadatchi Life
$C: Ever been out in the woods alone and suddenly get the feeling you are being watched?  It was this guy.
$C: This years Christmas card
$C: RUN, YOU FOOL, THERE'S A GIANT!!
$C: You are one with the mountain. 
$C: I love Lake Louise, and I've been there 3 times, but I've never seen the giant!
$C: This makes me feel like a migraine is setting in. Basically what it looks like right before I get one. 
$C: Bro drop the mixtape already.
$C: Paul Bunyan?
$C: Please tell us this is already your new profile picture on everything you own!
$C: Old man winter looks better prepared this year.
$C: The new season of Attack on Titan looks promising
$C: Well, did you accept?
$C: Fuck yeah. GO ALBERTA ROCKIES!
$C: Google knows
$C: google got game!
$C: Totally photoshopped. I can tell by the shadows.
$C: Old man mountain is waiting
$C: This is incredible.
$C: https://youtu.be/8OkpRK2_gVs
$C: Stupid, sexy, giant Flanders. 
$C: all hail the mountain king.
$C: Psst, hey kids! Wanna try a black diamond?
$C: Someone put Kevin spacey behind him
$C: That's awesome actually
$C: Nice snow out there, would’ve sucked to be mount slushmore 
$C: Muhaha! 😂🙃😆
$C: r/bossfight
$C: It could always be worse.
$C: Always watching
$C: Someone needs to Photoshop in a shadow of your head on the mountain to complete this picture.
$C: Better than what a green-screen can ever do 
$C: Never seen a more perfect photo
$C: Honestly thought that the dude was poking his head up between a model landscape. 
$C: Happy Mistakes.
$C: First Mt Rushmore. Now this.
$C: I can’t stop laughing. 
$C: Attack on Titan!
$C: Ah, Mount Darker. 
$C: Three more faces and it will be a new Mount Rushmore
$C: It's coming up, 
it's coming up, 
it's coming up, 
it's coming up, 
it's coming up, 
it's coming up, 
it's dare.
$C: Mount MeMore
$C: Be the mountain side. 
$C: Ahhh, the majestic Todd.  Our family promised, someday - by golly - we're gonna make our way to Lake Louise and see it for ourselves!  Word has it, photos do the scale no justice.
$C: Trees  shrunk in the dryer. Checkmate climate change deniers!
$C: Wow. Google really outdid itself with this one.
$C: Are you big enough 
$C: How’d you get your huge body stuck that deep in the ground for the panorama!?
$C: I wish I could do this kind of photoshopping.
$C: [removed]
$C: Majestic. As. Fuck. 
$C: EPIC!!
$C: *THE ICEMAN COMETH*
$C: Facebook cover photo thank you. 
$C: Bumbles bounce!
$C: that's a new looking titan
$C: Nice try Baldur. Nice try
$C: Yeah, I'd frame that one.
$C: He rises
$C: Reminds me of a sentinel from x-men
$C: Even Paul bunyon needs a skiing vacation once in a while 
$C: Take it.
$C: It's the big-head of the northwestern forests, lesser known cousin to the legendary big-foot.
$C: hah you are looking too large  
$C: He was a mountain of a man.  An appetite so large he carried with him a skillet sized well enough to cook a meal fit for 20 men and an axe so large and so sharp it could fell an entire forest in one swing.  He travelled with a giant brute of an ox named BABE who could drag a plow clear across the great plains of the United States of America. His name...was PAUL BUNYAN!
$C: Was this taken using a particular app or just using an android phone?
$C: Masterpiece.  Frame it.
$C: SUMMON THE LORD! A GIANT IS COMING!
$C: We found sasquatch and he's a boarder.
$C: Skiing is big in Canada.
$C: Big man in the snowy place. 
$C: The giant of the hills has awoken 
$C: You maniacs! You blew it up! God damn you! God damn you all to heeeeeeellll!
$C: Anybody expecting that I’m a giraffe vine guy sliding down the mountain.

$C: Armored Titan sporting a new look there
$C: Got an attack on Titan vibe hahaha
$C: Huh? there are trees in the background 
$C: Man I was there 5 years ago and I do not remember that landscape.
$C: Dem Titans coming oot the snow now.
$C: These Skyrim mods are getting out of hand...
$C: SIE SIND DAS ESSEN UND WIR SIND DIE JÄGER!! 
$C: That’s so cool
$C: damn thats a big Sasquatch 
$C: You're on the verge!
https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/1/18/16907456/google-photos-automatic-panorama-stitch-software-fail-reddit
$C: LMAO! 😂🤣👏
$C: Wow. New desktop wallpaper!
$C: That's wiwaxy 
$C: Hey I’ve been there
$C: Please frame that as a landscape in your house 
$C: This should've been Justin Timberlake's new album cover


$C: Funny you mention that, it's in my top 3. But by the time I watched that I was already on a huge anime binge. I meant that before I gave attack on Titan a chance, I had never really given anime in general a chance.


$C: Paging u/awildsketchappeared
$C: Took me a second to see it
$C: Well, this is a masterpiece all right. I am wallpapering it pronto!
$C: Where's Waldo?
$C: LMAO 
$C: Beautiful picture. And you really have photography and image editing skill. Like how you have your head there. Cool!!
$C: So that's what Lake Louise looks like 
$C: Pls help!! I’m new and need karma!

$C: +1 from me. This got a very weezy, throaty chuckle out of me 
$C: Hey man, just hijacking this top comment (sorry) to answer a few questions!

I am not the guy in the photo, that's my friend u/team_swilly who I photographed against the background!

Source photos are here as well as proof that this was Google's work and not my terrible photoshopping skills!

https://imgur.com/gallery/gtsdg

Edit: I literally took like 3 pictures, one with them in, and two without them. And for some bizarre reason Google Assistant offered me a really strange panorama of the 3 photos spliced together.

Edit2: Holy cow top 20 all time?!
$C: The shadow really helps. Notice how in his goggles someone stood to left in the reflection. 
$C: AI IS HERE!
$C: I want to upvote, but you are at 666!
$C: A real giant among men.
$C: For some reason this reminds me of that rick and morty “show me what you got” episode with the giant head 
$C: Right! He's looking like sneaky Mr. Steal Yo Ski Bunny

$C: Are we supposed to be getting season 3 this year?
$C: On that day the skiers received a grim reminer...
$C: This would be classified as an Abnormal.
$C: If you try to go to the basement, you're gonna have a hard time.
$C: Where can I watch Season 2? Is it on netflix?
$C: I came here solely for your AOT comment!!! 
$C: Mikasa can strike me alway where she wants :-) 
$C: The bees and the eagles!
$C: Leaking
$C: Google: giving the people what they didn't know they needed since day 1
$C: I think I see what happened here. If you look to the left of his head you can see that tree has been cut off and replaced upon the top of that other tree.

Given the perfectly blue sky behind both, google must have interpreted that tree - which was actually far behind him - to be a scale marker for everything else relative to his face in the image. That tree must have been sufficiently similar to the top of the other and boom - Skizilla. 
$C: Now run this through Arts & Culture. 
$C: It nailed everything here !
$C: I’ve never seen a better shot of Mount Steve. His goggles are glorious on sunny winter days like these
$C: Except the shadow.
$C: And by coincidence, the goggles are on sale!

$C: Isn’t it r/bossfights ? Or are there 2.

$C: Live free or dieeeee
$C: They are the food and we are the hunter!
$C: Take this: Ä
$C: Was
$C: Wait...is that actually what it says?
$C: Correct, Google Photos offers you animations if several photos are taken in quick succession, sometimes puts filters on your photos and offers panoramas if it notices your photos are side by side
$C: Google does some really neat things with your photos. Just yesterday it made a 2-minute long video piecing together highlights of all the videos my girlfriend has taken of her niece, from birth until now. Google titled it "They grow up so fast!". I guess it did face recognition on her niece.
$C: Yes. It offers me collages of my kids. It insists they're all the same person though.
$C: Dude, do you even Google?
$C: Google photos is an amazing project check it out!
$C: I always take a bunch of pics of launches, and it started making a [little gif](https://i.imgur.com/ozy3wHC.gifv) for me.  :)
$C: Dude, use Google Photos. Best mobile app and service in the world.

I dumped my 400GB of pictures and videos there, it swallowed them all and made wonders with it.

It recently created a "They grow so fast" video from my daughter. Since the very delivery to now, with chunks of videos and pics of her. Just popped up in my phone. Cried like a fucking baby.
$C: Increasingly becoming hard to depend on any form of digital media, sort of processing or manipulations everything goes through without asking for it and how clean and unnoticeable these artifacts can be, makes trust a prime casualty and these are unintended glitches!
$C: Yeah, I find it kind of annoying actually. I will say that the creations usually turn out well, but it's like get out of my shit Google.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Yep. On my device, the Google Photos app automatically creates panoramas from photos you take and sends you a notification when it does that.
$C: It does shit like this all the time. I took a picture of a crime scene a while ago and then like an hour later, Google was like "How do you like this filter?" and it was the picture I'd taken earlier with a sepia filter on it. What's worse is there's no obvious way to turn off this crap.
$C: Yup, it also enhances photos automatically.  My summer job is with parks and rec so I take a lot of pictures and Google makes them look awesome
$C: Yep! My Google Pixel does this stuff all the time. Picture collages, Gifs, Animations and Mini movies that it creates with my pictures and video clips.

Shit is cray, but sometimes cool.
$C: It always surprises me how far people are detached from Google Photos. If you have a smartphone (iPhone or Android), Google Photos offers unlimited backup at a lower resolution( and it's not even that much lower). So ditch your retarded iCloud storage and stop listening to whatever garbage Apple shits out without thinking twice or exploring other options. Google Photos automatically generates panoramas, animations, and even creates albums of photos taken on a certain date in a certain place. 

In b4 /r/hailcorporate. Like I said I'm just constantly surprised by how little people even look at other options instead of swallowing whatever one company sells them. And I know about Amazon Drive and use it as well before someone points me to that. 
$C: Yeah it happens to me too, kinda creepy. Although it's hilarious when it adds filters or effects to photos I took for work.
$C: What's interesting is that Google processes an image to make it look better before you even look at it. So, when you look at a photo you just took, you think it's objective, but Google may actually be altering the way you look at reality

$C: > You mean google took your pictures, made this panorama and offered it to you without you even ask? Did we reach this level of technology already?

Yes. Google Photos isn't the only app to do it. Facebook does it (complilation videos), and I'm sure many others.

But the most frustrating thing is that Google Photos did not give you the option to tell it to make a panorama with a set of photos. It just randomly decides when it wants to.
$C: Just heard there's been 8cm overnight!
$C: Two days ago...no idea why I put today in the title.

Conditions patchy in places, good for the most part, and way better than what I'm used to in Bulgaria. Snowed last night and more due tonight apparently :)

$C: Beautiful today. Been a bit patchy the last few days but loads of snowfall overnight and still snowing!
$C: On android, Google Photos offers you suggested edits to photos. For example, if you take multiple photos of someone in like 10 seconds it'll make an animation.

Here it took two or three photos I'd taken and spliced them into a panorama. For some unknown reason this is how it ended up.
$C: I have no idea, honestly
$C: So do I....

$C: Go away 
$C: Wow, other than accidentally putting the giant head in the photo, that panorama stitching is amazing. I could not tell at all it was a stitched panorama. Usually there's dead giveaways because you can see vertical lines in the sky where it was stitched.

Actually, as that I'm typing this, I'm realizing that must be how they blend the stitches together so well. Instead of just using a simple vertical stitch with localized blending, they do a much more sophisticated blend following shapes. That explains how the head was blended in so seamlessly, and the sky gradient is perfectly smooth.
$C: They should add a surrealist checkbox in the settings for photos assistant.
$C: Please tell me you guys laughed for a solid few minutes at what it cranked out, it's hilarious how perfectly it fits
$C: Is this a feature of newer phones or something? I've never seen a panorama generated on any phone I have without selecting panorama mode in the camera and it doesn't just combine random pics...
$C:  That would make an excellent desktop background...
$C: Google made a photo of me throwing my own arm in to lake Michigan once.
$C: Thank you. I needed this.
$C: It was really good at adding holiday shit into my photos four or five years ago so I don't doubt this at all
$C: Google assistant randomly makes little mash up videos for me on days after I take lots of pictures but I can never find the videos again
$C: Google doesn't make "Accidents".
$C: Reflection looks like Kane of the Brotherhood of Nod.
$C: Idk what that has to do with it, I'm confused.

$C: Trying to image the strip that would go with the caption is pretty amazing, too. 

There was a section in "Prehistory of The Far Side" that had pages from his sketch book. Some of the captions were even more off-the-wall than this - one that always stuck with me was a sketch of a guy with a raccoon-skin hat and a rifle above the caption "It was Jeremiah's job to guard the rhubarb, but he never knew why."

I miss The Far Side...

And this time, Google nailed it on an epic level. What a time to be alive.
$C: My favorite was when google took a bunch of photos of my cats and made a two minute video complete with music and cat noises. 

Edit: I can't find the video right now but here is a recent photo of [Siegfried in a tiny sombrero](https://imgur.com/a/ZznUf). Some of Reddit might remember him as the cat with the tiny couch. 
$C: Occasionally their assisstant comes up with some cool stuff. Other times it basically creates a collage of like 4 terrible photos, etc. But yeah, I appreciate it. Plus the search feature on there is the tits. 
$C: So if someone took a load of dick pics, google would make a big panorama shot of all of them? Impressively creepy
$C: It also puts entire videos together if you take lots of clips, and edits them to music. They're not always perfect, but I really enjoy them nonetheless. 
$C: This seems like it was written by PR. BUT I don't care, Google Photos is an amazing app
$C: Is it an app or something?
$C: A while back my grandma died and recently Google just compiled a bunch of her photos shortly taken before her death and compiled them into a collage or whatever. It was surprising to say the least 
$C: All Google does for me is apply a black and white filter :(
$C: Next it will be automatically creating an account on a printing site and sending you offers for your images on tshirts, mugs, and high-quality canvas artwork for your home. 
$C: As an app? Or? I’m not sure how this works
$C: Google photos would also combine sleeping pictures of your infant and add a lullaby and make a video out of it and make you cry.
$C: Wait how do I sign up for this?
$C: My dog passed away three weeks ago, google made a video of his best moments with an emotional song in the background. Needless to say I cried. 
$C: I quite enjoy getting the assist pop up telling me it's got a new stylised photo or video for me. It was a *bit* awkward when it made my partners pictures from a trip to Auschwitz into a movie with really cheery music. 
$C: Yeah, Google once added David Hasselhoff to a picture that a friend sent me. It was... kind of creepy.

Edit: [Found the pic.](https://i.imgur.com/RpIQyez.jpg)
$C: I thought my Pixel 2 was just possessed when it started offering me modified photos. The first week I had it, I snapped a pic of an old barn on our property covered in snow and I thought to myself "I'll do a black and white filter in this when I get home" and within a couple hours I felt my phone buzz with a notification saying Google offered me this filtered image and it was that image in black and white. Creeped the hell out of me.
$C: Next season, on Black Mirror:
$C: Yep. It did it with my daughter. Since birth. Cried a lot. Love Google photos like no other app or service in the world.
$C: It provided me one of my daughter from 0-2 years and I bawled my eyes out the entire length of the video gg Google you ended me
$C: My friend got a "They grow up so fast" video. Except he had only started Google Photos in the past year, so it only contained photos of his son at age 5. lol
$C: "neat"
$C: They are. One kid has been posing as many for years to cash in on multiple birthdays. 
$C: Who are you to question Google?
$C: > It offers me collages of my kids. 

Too bad it doesn't offer college to your kids.
$C: They're just rapidly moving to and fro so that it appears to your old eyes that there are several of them.

It's just one.

Like the Olsen twins.
$C: Probably an iSlave.. Psh, peasants don't know the #PixelLyfe
$C: Does it work for iOS people?
$C: deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.1188  glhf 96044)
$C: "permission"
$C: google photos -> settings -> assistant cards -> turn off everything
$C: But isn't it also a little scary that Google is editing photos perhaps with people not even noticing it? We like to think of photos as being objective, but this makes the line between reality and fiction a little blurrier.
$C: You can turn it off if you don't like it
$C: I had the Magisto app or however it is spelled and it would sometimes auto-generate a movie out of pics and video clips. There was a meeting where I took a bunch of pictures of the whiteboards and a few of the team and it put them all together with a techno beat and strobe light effects. Made the day feel more fun that it actually was. 
$C: Epic! Getting up at 6a to drive from Calgary on saturday.
$C: Holy shit that's like 533 cm to us mortals.


-I'm assuming that tree that went from below shoulder to top is roughly 33m.
$C: Haha. That seems like an answer to one of askreddit's question "Why did you lie unexpectedly or something like that."

$C: Snowboard Titan needs no ramp. Snowboard Titan will do a sick 720 Ollie over that wall.

$C: Thanks for popping my Reddit gold cherry kind stranger!! I literally put it through a filter on the prism app, but it looks good enough to hang on the wall lol
$C: Well you have graced my accusation with a response, so I will give my redaction. 

Let it be known that I fasteddy, would like to make it known the MalletsDarker is a gentleman of the highest caliber and by all appearances a seeker of truth and transparency. 
$C: Omg that is hilarious. Thanks for the clarification! I don’t upload to Google so was all the more clueless. 
$C: I can do that too

Wrong res for a panorama stich. Sorry but just own it
$C: I saw that after I commented. Thanks.

$C: Congratulations! You just let someone else make money off your efforts! 
$C: Yes! That's the point. It's a reminder. 😊
$C: This ignores the possibility that his friend was actually in the trees.
$C: yeah my coworker mate went somewhere and took 3-4 pics of the inside of a warehouse where he was doing a job (it was a particularly large one like an airplane hangar hence the photos) and then google made an automatic up/down/left/right panorama. it used all the pics facing up down left or right and put them together into a giant mega photo. he said when he saw it on his phone he was surprised cause he never did a panorama photo but it looked absolutely perfect like it was just one big image. really cool tech
$C: it also removed the fence...

$C: You just reinvented seam carving.
$C: Oh yes. We were looking at the day's photos in awe of the views but then this popped up and we had tears in our eyes for ages
$C: You take the photos (they don't need to be panorama), upoad them to Google photos, and if they are similar enough they will be stitched into a panorama automagically by Google. It also creates GIFs and other neat things once you upload the photos. 
$C: it made one of my son that showed about 18 months worth of his growth from baby to toddler. it was actually amazing

$C: google should have advertised [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbYWhdLO43Q) to you
$C: Because google gives a shit
$C: On toilet having trouble. Could use some. Where are you Google when I needed you.
$C: Dookilax
$C: Nobody likes sitting on a hard stool.
$C: Stool softeners are one of the fastest growing non prescription in the health arena in the us

With the rampant use of opioids and all types of pain killers, with side effects being a difficulty with stool processing.....

Buy stock 
$C: It makes "grinding out a grumpy" less grumpy
$C: Glad to hear you're off the hard shit.
$C: Wouldn’t a soft stool collapse the moment you sat on it?
$C: Target predicted a girls pregnancy before her parents found out.
$C: Do you apply it directly to the stool?
$C: "Tips tin foil hat" M'Learning

$C: The ever elusive Godzilla (1998) reference. Say what you will, but I enjoyed that movie, and the soundtrack was dope.
$C: Neither can Illinoisans or Texans
$C: Well thank you for the clarification! I’m now subbed to both. 
$C: I love Reddit.
$C: So.....basically just another subreddit. Thanks for clarifying! 👍
$C: AAAHAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
$C: The music video perfectly encapsulates my feelings after a hard day. You just want to get home, get into comfy clothes (or in this case a cowboy hat) and scream at the top of your lungs.
$C: What... the fuck is this... thing?
$C: ...I actually like it.
$C: I didn't know I needed this in my life until this moment. Thank you. Thank you so very much.
$C: Thank you 
$C: Me when I step on a lego
$C: Knew what it was going to be before clicking it. Still clicked it and enjoyed it.
$C: haha better than i remember it!
$C: Was expecting the dancing praise the lord clip, was not disappointed. 
$C: And it's always such a great feeling to find them by accident Ü .
$C: *jazz hands* Mandela!! 
$C: Glorious
$C: Ja aber ich hatte das auf Englisch gesagt.
$C: I would like to see that one
$C: They did the same with my dog pictures using the The Blue Danube Waltz song.
$C: Google made a video out of the pictures I took at my friend's farm and added country music.
$C: I got one of these too!! Was yours a song that just repeated "meow meow meow meow-meowwww"? Because I get it stuck in my head ALL THE TIME now.
$C: Hey wait a minute

Sure you're not using Gloggle?
$C: Yeah, except for me the cats are drunken pictures of myself ._.
$C: Oh wow, I'm going to re-enable these options now.
$C: They did that for me too. Such a treat! 
$C: Meow movie, it made one on my phone as well. I thought it was hilarious. 
$C: Please send when you find it ♡ 
$C: My collages are usually 4 of basically the same unimportant photo.
$C: The fact that Google photos recognises my cat from all angles and also pictures of me as a child is both impressive and kind of scary
$C: I need more info on that search feature.

up till now I only save my pictures in my own Owncloud though, don't know whether I like the "every picture is online for google" thing
$C: Would be so funny if somehow posted that here.

  Right now.

  ... so we could see it...
$C: Google would make your dick huge brah
$C: Oooh! Interesting...🤔💡
$C: Not sure about the panorama shot.. however I have seen the search feature return dick pics when searching for “fast food”
$C: I'm literally dying right now...
$C: It is the app that finally made me give up my (pointless) boycott of everything Google, except YouTube.
$C: Google Photos
$C: Google photos...comes with android phones!
$C: awwww that's so cute how Google is watching your child sleep at night. I'm sure it's all just a machine too, and there's absolutely no engineers or workers at Google who have access to that info of your child. 
$C: Seriously this is exactly what you'd expect as the intro to the crazy technology in the show before it shows how it's actually harmful.
$C: You receive a video, from birth to 20 the twist she was only born an hour ago. 
$C: ...Google Photos has been available on iPhones for a very long time now lol
$C: From our point of view the googlers are evil!
$C: Google Photos is on iOS and Apple Photos also pops up with weird auto generated "Memories".
$C: deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.6518  glhf 81880)
$C: Yep anybody can use it on web, iOS, and Android.

They recently added auto shared album which is great for loved ones
$C: I have disabled it now, but it took a little while to figure out how/where
$C: It doesn't delete the original, it just gives you the option of saving the touched up one
$C: I know, it doesn't bother me that much and it's kind worth the occasional funny picture.
$C: But not really off
$C: Hahahahaha that's awesome
$C: More forecast so you're in for a treat. I fly home Saturday so last ski day tomorrow! At least it's not still -30C like last week
$C: http://www.snow-forecast.com/resorts/Lake-Louise/6day/mid

carpool? See ye at the meeting spot.
$C: Can't remember the names of the chairlifts but it's after you get the first one up from the village, and then right at the bottom of the 2nd one that's next to it. The viewpoint there.

Does that make any sense? Haha
$C: Dosent need to be for snowboard titan to pull it off. He's a champ
$C: And he's careful not to speak so as not to cause avalanches to endanger the skiers.  Just gives them a thumbs-up from time to time.
$C: Random Handmaid's Tale ref. Nothing to see here, move along..
$C: Yeah I did. Posted it there this morning and then copied the link. Mobile format maybe?
$C: Buuuutttt not by humans
$C: [removed]
$C: This was actually a perfect representation.  His friend really is a floating disembodied head.
$C: *among the trees.
$C: Google is great again!

$C: It could always be worse https://i.imgur.com/JuYTEjS.jpg 
$C: Sooo.... has anyone ever told you you're a complete dickhead?
$C: I don’t think anything is really worse than a human centipede baby
$C: Isn't this in a Duck Sauce music video
$C: But nothing compares to this https://m.imgur.com/gallery/R390EId
$C: It could always be worse https://i.imgur.com/R390EId.jpg
$C: The mom is just there saying "Why the hell did I try to have a kid?"
$C: That gives the human centipede a whole new meaning O.o
$C: The second from the back set of legs looks like a giant ballsack. 
$C: Nah.
$C: "Here come the legs!....and here come the...other legs?...and here comes-PUSH IT BACK IN PUSH IT IN EVERYBODY OUT QUICK"
$C: Imagine just giving birth
$C: Imagine how long the turds are!
$C: It would be like Mary Poppins purse but sideways.
$C: puuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuush!
$C: I imagine it would be like one of those prank snake in a can toys.
$C: I love the startled look of the person on the right.

"The fuck is that?"
$C: How do I biiiiirth this kiiiiiiid
$C: Don’t worry it’s just the awkward phase right before turning into a pupa. That “Thing” will be a beautiful butterfly one day. 
$C: If you were saying that to a family member you'll probably give birth to something similar ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
$C: You don’t give birth to it. It takes it for itself...
$C: Meh, once the head comes out, it's all gravy after that ;)
$C: I was just about to create a new subreddit and was trying to decide what to call it.
$C: Oh fuck yeah, that's what I've been looking for
$C: Is there a subreddit for such relevant subreddits 
$C: One was just created: /r/panoramasgonewrong
$C: here u go

$C: The Hipster Gorilla of Central Park.
$C: Thank goodness for amnesiacs
$C: Fuck, marry, kill. He's the only option.
$C: > it.


$C: Are you that girl that fucked her dog?
$C: Delete this nephew.
$C: It’s crazy how recognisable it is, I also immediately thought “hey look it’s Budapest!”. I think this is right outside the Parliament building, I remember standing on that dock.
$C: Seems dead though. I checked a few others and they're equally dead. Maybe we should make one? 
$C: M-more. Ugh
$C: \*Eggar
$C: So he went Back to the Past?
$C: Pa-job
$C: Well met!
$C: I love it.
$C: Someone should make this into a book!
$C: He failed at making something shitty.
$C: He forgot to add in a few random, unexplained cows
$C: Oh believe me...you know *exactly* what failure is...don't you?
$C: Dither?!?! I barely even know her!
$C: It's on the internet so nah.
$C: It feels like there's a lot of newer people replying who have no idea who he is. 

Man, I miss when novelty accounts were everywhere. :(
$C: Not much to get really, its just absurdist.
$C: Have fun?
$C: "unsolicited" is the word you're looking for.
$C: He would be smoking r/trees.
$C: Not even One Punch Man?
$C: Same, except my first animé was Pokémon. Attack on Titan was my first "real" animé, though.
$C: http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/29/attack-on-titan-season-3-premiere-details-announced
$C: Compared to season 1 it was a mess. 
$C: Personally I find the fee for Crunchyroll premium to be well worth it compared to ad filled sites with crazy popups and buffering videos.

Crunchyroll even has a ton of anime available for free, just at a lower quality and not immediately after it's broadcast.

But yeah, if something is ridiculously hard to find, or unavailable based on region... a weebs gotta do what a weebs gotta do
$C: I never knew I needed death sticks until my local drug dealer caught me in the cantina and said "hey, you wanna buy some death sticks?" 
$C: I never knew I needed ripe, juicy tomatoes until Google told me how delicious they are and how rich they are in vitamin C, biotin, molybdenum, vitamin K, copper, potassium, manganese, dietary fiber, vitamin A (in the form of beta-carotene), vitamin B6, folate, niacin, vitamin E and phosphorus!

They’re a superfood!

Eat more tomatoes, y’all!
$C: Google suggested me a bouncy house after watching dragon porn
$C: I never knew I needed a French tickler until I saw George Carlin.
$C: FYI, if you want online ads to stop tracking you, you can actually opt out of it. If you see that teal triangle with an i inside of it next to the ad, then it's part of a group of advertisers where you can opt out here: http://optout.aboutads.info

Also on your browsers, you should turn on "Do Not Track" or "Tracking Protection" in your privacy settings.
$C: Did you ever see the [parody](https://youtu.be/cNQ3sxvslhQ) ZebraCorner made? I always like how they make fun of these commercials.

$C: What's not to like?
$C: Is that supposed to be a smiley face at the end of that sentence?
$C: Would it be better if it was made by a computer program or a human doing their job?
$C: Mine my cat under "dog". 
$C: It was a few months back but that sounds about right. I knew the assistant did stylized photos and albums but the video took me completely off guard. It was hilarious.
$C: Ha, hahaha, get the hell out of here 
$C: Yeah, like an accidental burst photo where you didn't realize the volume button doesn't change the shutter volume. Not that that has happened to me many times or anything. I'm not a smart man. 
$C: Google photos search feature lets you search for specific people, whatever object you can think of, places, date and time ranges, etc. The caveat to this is that to search for people, it will ask you who someone is in your photos that it doesn't recognize, you either pick from one of your gmail contacts or you can just type in a name if you like. For objects, you can say table, chair, couch, Eiffel Tower, Christmas tree, dogs, cats, things of that nature. When google uploads your photos, it will automatically parse the data and look for those objects using their proprietary algorithms. 

Apple has something similar in Apple photos, but google is the king of all things data, so their algorithms are a little more reliable. 

Google photos has other great features that I like, though. Like, automatic backups, automatic sharing with a specific partner (I don't do this), it will automatically create albums and ask you if you want to keep them, etc. It also makes it really easy to share the albums with people. My favorite feature is the ability to free up photo space on my photo, where it will go and delete all photos and videos that have been uploaded to google already (you have to select this).

Overall, I'm happy with the service. I would have chosen iCloud except its more of a pain to access and manage outside of the Apple ecosystem. 
$C: I search things like city/state locations all the time, holidays, or groups with specific multiple people. I can say "Susie Jason & Mark Christmas videos" and it'll return everything meeting that criteria.

One Halloween a few years ago it even took pictures of the most-photographed people and made them spooky with overlaid silly masks or lightening flashes that showed a skull over their faces for an instant.

My phone even lets me take photospheres where it walks me through capturing a couple dozen pictures in every direction & then it stitches them together similar to the auto-panoramas. I have fun with the kids moving to pose for every direction so i have a photosphere where there's like 5x copies of the kids doing stuff. 
$C: It allows you to put names to people and animal's faces. Then you can quickly find every picture with a certain person's face in it. I believe you can also type  in something generic, like mountains, and it will show you every picture it thinks has mountains in it. It's creepy, but super convenient. Just have to decide if it is worth it to you.
$C: For science. 
$C: Sir! Do you need help sir!
$C: Why no YouTube?
$C: BWAHAHahahahahahaha

Seriously though, it really is a shame how far Google has fallen. 


I'm sure that fiber is gonna roll out to the rest of us any day now... right? 
$C: What are you talking about!? What could *possibly* go wrong with a large faceless and money driven organization whose willing to do some of the most heinous things to the public at large all for advertising revenue... what could possibly go wrong with giving them large swathes of your personal information and life that they have the power to analyze and use in ways that are not only incomprehensible to most, but also never known to any regulating agencies outside of the company itself???


You're just paranoid! After all, they even *said* they would "Do No Evil"... You're just paranoid. It'll be fine. haha. Your so paranoid. What a conspiracy nut, amirite guise!? haha. These silly conpiracy people.

$C: My favorite iPhoto Memory was titled "Trip to Arden Fair Mall 2015" because I apparently took a bunch of photos there one day. I think I was testing the camera in a new phone.  
$C: TIL
$C: This is awesome 
$C: What I'm saying is that when you take a photo, even if the assistant doesn't add "effects", it still processes your photo before you look at it. And the processed photo is the only one I have access to. 
$C: Yep - you've taken the Glacier Express - the one that starts next to the Kokannee Kabin (if it's still called that - I haven't been there for a couple of years!) Then skiied down to the Top of the World chair.  Not far from Whitehorn Lodge.  In your picture I think you're emerging from the Men's Downhill piste.
$C: Not entirely,  just his head. 
$C: Or maybe he's just really close and the size of a potato
$C: [It could always be worse.](http://imgur.com/LDplNMs.jpg)

$C: Funny you mention that, it's in my top 3. But by the time I watched that I was already on a huge anime binge. I meant that before I gave attack on Titan a chance, I had never really given anime in general a chance.
$C: Then it's not the same...
$C: Well, yeah I guess if we're counting Pokémon. Attack on Titan made me get over my fear of subtitles though
$C: Agreed, but I'm one of the people in the seasonal treadmill so it's worth paying it to me. If you just want to watch a single show it might not be though so just watch the ads

$C: My bad lmao, did I not get your joke in the first post? 😂😂 I just woke up 
$C: He literally replied below that he wasn't joking lol
$C: That's great. Nothing like an AI montage from the mall with some muzak to brighten your day.

So you manage to get her some help and she decides to go to a community college instead because she's smart enough to realize that ivy leagues are a waste of money nowadays. She excels in her math courses and saves a ton of money getting most of the prereq's out of the way for her four year college degree, which she obtains with ease.


She then goes on to become a commander in the military and a guardian to The Library.

$C: [It could always be worse.](https://i.imgur.com/BOIyjO3.jpg)
$C: That's some Cyriak-level shit, right there. 
$C: This is like a still from a [cyriak video] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FavUpD_IjVY).
$C: Even the cars got in on it!!
$C: What's between his legs?
$C: My name is Barry Allen!
$C: Is that Vincent Adultman?
$C: But you think there’s a uterus long enough for that job?
$C: She's married to the muffin man....
$C: Right? It’s basically like watching soldiers loading shells into a howitzer. Just...wetter.
$C: Although I've heard that it's a feature of the process. 
$C: are you asking or are you telling?
$C: /r/MNightPanoramalan
$C: Likewise :-D
$C: Yes! 
$C: Ah, I see you’re a traditional conservative, opting to marry before consummating the marriage.
$C: I like your style.
$C: the reference, nasty
$C: Sorry tha- sorry tha- sorry tha- sorry that happened
$C: How long can this go on?
$C: Heh. Greetings.
$C: I'm Garth Merenghi. Author. Visionary.

Dreamweaver.
$C: Fuck.... thanks.
$C: Haven't heard of it. Right now my top 3 anime are all very different from one another, from 1 to 3 in this order - Death Note, Attack On Titan, and One Punch Man. So I really have no idea what genre I would say is my favorite. 
$C: The dub of AoT is... odd. (AoT spoilers)  At one point in the subtitled version one of the characters (Armin) says something rather profound.  If I recall correctly, he said something like, sometimes, someone may have to give up their humanity ("what makes them ‘innocent’" may be another way to put it) to get something accomplished. An entire season later, that same character flashes back to what he said and subsequently decides to give up his humanity to save his best friend.  It's rather heart-wrenching to watch, unless you watch the dubbed version where he said something completely different that makes no sense in the context of that later scene.  (End AoT spoilers)
$C: It was the first show I watched that I had to read sub titles. 
$C: I googled this and... it's a thing. Weow.

$C: Actually, the vendor Elan Sel'Sabango did indeed go home and rethink his life and had an interesting story after that which you can read about here http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Elan_Sel%27Sabagno
$C: I never knew I needed to know about the droid attack on the wookies until Ki-Adi-Mundi asked about the droid attack on the wookies 
$C: War Eagle!
$C: We all need to rethink the seller‘s life. Sitting in a very small corner. 
$C: Sam...
$C: ...AAH!
$C: "kamehamehaaaAAAAHHHHhhhhhh dammit I think I sharted."
$C: Yeah, I believe Google gets more ad revenue from iOS so they pretty much have every major Google service on iOS too. Plus, the goal of Photos is to mine data, might as well include the millions of iOS users on it too. 
$C: deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.0748  glhf 85070)
$C: Nah, Google rarely does things exclusive. Some of their apps even get released on iOS first
$C: Actually I think every single one of those would fit perfectly on /r/Bossfight  
$C: What is there not a subreddit for. /r/notasubreddityet
$C: I was gonna say....there's no way there are this many hilarious examples and no sub for it

Thanks!
$C: Aaaannnndd... subscribed.
$C: the hero we all need
$C: Sweet! Thanks for my new favourite sub!
$C: Subbed, thanks
$C: I was just saying to myself, through happy/horrified tears of laughter, I hope there's a sub for this...
$C: Oh this is great 😂
$C: *Cue Inception trailer music*
$C: I’m not sure how this one doesn’t have over a thousand upvotes. It’s awesome!!!
$C: This made me feel a little unsettled.
$C: Is this what scientists mean when they talk about folding time and space?
$C: “Jeez, you’ve got a big puuuuuuuuuusssssssssyyyyyy”
$C: Good luck finding someone to sign that marriage certificate
$C: Prepare to face The Mighty Millhouse Manastorm!
$C: Plus actor.
$C: Hunter x hunter is like a super dope version of naruto in a sense. It's from the same people that made yuyu hakusho, which is DEFINITELY another must watch. They're essentially like fighting or fighting competition type anime.
$C: I've seen the dub, I love it, but I'm obviously biased as I just can't seem to get on the sub train with animes for a number of reasons. I know subbed is supposed to be better, the vast majority of people say so, but I just can't get into it lol.
$C: Well you could've watched the dub, no?
$C: reddit and the great ppl within it never cease too amaze me
$C: They left out the part where the death stick dealer then goes home, quits his drug dealing, and lives paycheck-to-paycheck while his kids go hungry because he lost a big source of income.
$C: r/prequelmemes
$C: Have you heard the tale of [Darth Plagueis, the wise?](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Darth_Plagueis_(novel))
$C: Still not as deadly as sadness.
$C: Followed the link and the advertisement at the bottom f the page told me, ["This is your brain. This is your brain on drugs..."](https://i.imgur.com/SytmeIv.png)

Thanks google
$C: The amount of Star Wars canon outside the movies is incredible. 
$C: I like how the dealer stuck to his grammar of "wanna" instead of obi wan's "want to"
$C: A story of more illegal dealings and more rethinking his life. What a life.
$C: War eagle friend! =D
$C: *the one where he doesnt scream*
$C: Or on a sequel to the Human Centipede
$C: These would all fit well in a Thing themed sub as well.
$C: Thank you for introducing me to that
$C: hahahaha hyuck yuck yuck yuck yuck yuck
$C: As Frank always said, "I know a guy."
$C: EVERYONE, GET IN HERE!
$C: YOU FACE JARAXXUS, EREDAR LORD OF THE BURNING LEGION
$C: I greet you.
$C: I tried the dub for Season 2. Armin's voice in that one scene in the premier sounded so ridiculous that I stopped watching the dub for several weeks.  So, yeah, I prefer the subbed version.
$C: I watched it through Netflix, and apparently Netflix only has subs. I'm saying that I liked the show enough to read subtitles. Now I actually greatly prefer subs. Just reading the screen keeps my way more focused and involved in what I'm watching. Plus the lips sync up quite a bit more convincingly. 
$C: So much useless information. It's a beautiful thing. 
$C: thats okay, Sheev will avenge him 
$C: He actually went back to selling the finest deathsticks in the galaxy, then did another moral 180 and started handing out pamphlets against drug use before rethinking his life another time.

It's actual canon: http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Elan_Sel%27Sabagno
$C: Have you heard the tale of Snoke the wasted character?
$C: Aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh
$C: YOU FACE JARAXXUS, ERADAR LORD OF THE BURNING LEGION
$C: heh, PILE ON!
$C: *TRIGGERED*
$C: How long must this go on?
$C: Lol I definitely do not like his voice at all in the dub.
$C: Idk about specifically AoT, but you may just not have the function to choose subs or dub on whatever device you're using. I only say this, because I've spent way too much time trying to figure how to find this function on my Blu-ray player with no success. It's not that the anime's I was watching didn't have the option too, because they did on my playstation. Extremely frustrating. 
$C: *Useless?* Judge me by my size, do you?
$C: r/empiredidnothingwrong
$C: Good ol' Sheev "Frank" Palpatine.
$C: I'd watch that
$C: My dreaming ends. Your nightmare begins.
