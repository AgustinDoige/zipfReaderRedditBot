She took me in 15 years ago and no one makes me as happy. We had the best Xmas. I love my Granma so much.

$C: Nice cardigan and bow tie.
$C: For this wondering how she took me in. I grew up in a kids home (orphanage) after losing my parents. She was my key worker there as well as my carer. When I was too old to live there and had to move out.

She was  retiring at the time after 40 years as a carer and said that she couldn't stand to lose me, which kinda works out great because I love her and I couldn't stand to lose her either.
$C: I just love this story! She is an awesome lady and I'm quite sure she helped mold you into an awesome man! You look so happy! That cheese is genuine! 


Edit: changed lay to lady. ...because that's disrespectful 

Edit 2: thank all you kind strangers for this sweet Christmas karma! It's really made my day!  

The last edit: OMG! MERRY CHRISTMAS AND THANK YOU TO WHO[M]EVER GAVE ME GOLD!  I'd never thought I'd see the day! And thanks to swype text for thinking lady was lay! 







$C: You two look so happy. [I made a sketch for you](https://i.imgur.com/3UjGG3r.jpg)

Edit: Several kind redditors asked me to give the sketch to op. I am more than glad to give it to op. messaged him. Thank you everyone. Merry Christmas!
$C: Took you in how?  Tell the story!  It's a happy picture.

$C: This is what grandmas do best!
$C: Just when I start to hate people, I come across this post and it reminds me that people can be awesome. Your granny is the best 😊😊😢👍👏🙏
$C: Your grandmother is a young black man?
$C: yo that's cool as hell man. we need more people like both of you. 

My mom's a social worker in a similar field to your grandma and she got fired for loaning/giving one of the kids $20 to buy a christmas present for one of their parents (parents were alive but recovering addicts trying to get their life together)

On top of that, social workers get paid peanuts, so most of them truly love what they do.

Merry christmas

$C: [we all need a loving family](https://imgur.com/gallery/0Vquk) 

My wife and our son. He’s been thru so much in his 6 short years. 
$C: This is such a sweet picture. I would just like wish everyone this kind of love for Christmas.
$C: That's, flat out, one of the best Christmas pics I've seen. Now *that's* what I call a family. 
$C: Ahhh bro! I was just talking to someone today about how Christmas hasn't really meant as much to me since my Grandmother passed (even less since mom passed.) 

Seeing you get to enjoy yours on Christmas brings fond memories of mine. :)

She was the biggest supplier of books and knowledge throughout my life and she always wrapped my gifts in sunday comics with her favourites, cut out and pasted over top. <3 
$C: This is what it means to be a good human. I strive to reach her level someday. Well done grandma. 
$C: This could fill Even the Grinch’s heart with warmth. 
$C: Merry Christmas! I'm sure the feeling is mutual. 

This is my first Christmas with our adopted child (baby) and it's amazing. 
$C: There is a certain, real, inextricable beauty to this.
$C: How wonderful! God bless you both! Merry Christmas. 
$C: Damn allergies, making my eyes all watery... 
$C: Love both of your smiles! 
Best to you both!
$C: [deleted]
$C: Majora's Mask?
$C: [deleted]
$C: I love your gran, too. She is a good woman and seeing her smile makes me smile.
$C: I'm so glad you two found each other, Merry Christmas to you both!
$C: What a lovely story op! Ty for sharing this! 

PS Wishing you both a merry christmas and happy holidays! 
$C: I'm just watering my beard, not crying. 
$C: Saw the picture without the title: first thing I thought of was Denzel from Brickleberry.

Fans know what I'm talking about 😉
$C: The smiles are priceless
$C: Thanks for sharing this.  We just celebrated Christmas for the first time with Foster children.  One in particular is an ungrateful teenager... Oh the words I want to use... Anyway it's nice to see we can provide hope.  You look so happy I hope we can provide the same some day to our children.
$C: There is so much good in the world. We just have to share it. 
$C: This is the kind of stuff I love to see. Beautiful 
$C: That's beautiful. Merry Christmas.
$C: Nice man Im so happy for you!
Once you lose those watching over you its a quick path to go down a wrong route in life. Glad you both seem so happy and loving.
$C: Sweetness is at its peak.
$C: There’s a lot of love in that picture. 
$C: This is a beautiful story and the two of you are so adorable together.  I am so glad you have this person.  Having at least one person who believes in you is crucial.  It's so important.  
$C: You both look so happy, What a great woman to have taken you under her wing. Merry Christmas to you both!
$C: much love to both of you this is heartwarming af
$C: You both are absolutely beautiful, and those smiles tell us all we need to know about how much love there is between you. Much happiness this season to y'all <3
$C: This is beautiful. It’s a Goddamn Christmas miracle.
$C: Sounds like an amazing woman, and a great guy for acknowledging her and sharing your story with Reddit. Such genuine and contagious happy smiles. This should be one of those stock photos that come in picture frames when you buy them lol

Merry Christmas to the both of you and everyone else in here.
$C: Man it's tough when they leave. This is our first Christmas without Grandpa and it was tough. It's so awesome you are showing her all your love now. Both of you are lucky to have each other. 
$C: I ultra-skimmed the title and interpreted the picture as a very interesting couple.
$C: Awee :) 
$C: Merry Christmas! This warms my heart!
$C: Dude, order this thread by controversial and have yourself a good Christmas laugh. 
$C: Sweet! 😍
$C: This is awesome!
How can a world we live in be this awesome but there are people out there whom are terrified by race or have  ideologies that we are not all equal? I can’t understand it. Hopefully the next generation will our number people whom have this idea?
$C: I lost my Grammy 30 years  ago today. This post warms my heart to the core. I miss her every day. The kindest, sweetest lady in the world. She would make all these Swedish dishes that were so scrumptious. 
$C: When ever I see a post like this, just two people that happen to be two separate races. Reddit never never lets down with the over karma-ing "ohh you're so amazing" comments. It reminds me of when someone is uncomfortable about meeting a handicap person and talks really really loud because they just don't get it. Nice photo, nothing extraordinary here though.
$C: Let me guess why this particular one made the front page...
$C: White guy and white grandma, this pic gets 12 upvotes maybe.
$C: God’s blessings to you both!
$C: This is great. Also, you're handsome. Have a great day, internet stranger! It's good to see some love in the world!
$C: I love this photo! You look super happy, and that makes me happy too! 😁
$C: Welcome to the front page

$C: Merry Christmas to you and your Granma
$C: Merry Christmas friend. Love your smile, hat, your nan, and your sense of dress! Lots of love your way from Canada!
$C: Your story is touching and your family is a beautiful one. Blessings to you both. 
$C: Must fight the feels... I must resist... Just too many emotions right now....  And for the last damn time, stop cutting onions! 
$C: What a wholesome post
$C: Thats cute! Merry Christmas to you both!  
:)
$C: Can we adopt each other as siblings? No blood family on this side of the screen so I'd be happy to have a wonderful adopted sibling!

$C: She looks like a sweetheart. 
$C: 😭so good. 🎄
$C: She looks like a jolly, no-nonsense and kind soul.

Merry Christmas to you both!
$C: These are the everyday heroes the people working these jobs and really caring about it. i feel like we are really moving away from it where everyone is pushed into whatever makes the most money and doing something good that makes you feel good is not as appealing anymore to people.
$C: Your grandma is adorable but I'm also giving props for that awesome Majora's Mask hat!!
$C: Merry Christmas to you both, your story is wonderful :)
$C: That's a good picture.
$C: More importantly is that a Majora’s Mask hat?!    Merry Christmas!

$C: Why is my room so dusty all of a sudden? Its getting in my eyes.
$C: Awh this is lovely to see. Wishing you both all the best :) 
$C: [Sup, Jacob.](https://i.imgur.com/xPvw6Nj.png)
$C: Your picture makes me happy. Thank you for sharing. 
$C: This is my first christmas without my grandma Johnny.  My parents divorced when I was young and my mom had a drinking problem so when custody came up, the court allowed my grandma to supervise my visits with my mom.  If my mom had been drinking I wasnt allowed to see her.  My grandma would still take me every other weekend though.  She was instrumental in my upbringing.

You two look great!  Enjoy every second!  Merry Christmas dude!
$C: This is beautiful ❤️
$C: That’s an amazing story Merry Christmas!
$C: Thanks for sharing tales of good people at this time of year add to the magic of the season, I'm so happy for you! 
$C: Grandma*
$C: ❤️❤️❤️ much love brother :) this picture and your story really lifted me today. Thanks 
$C: This is an incredible photo.  Merry Christmas to you both!
$C: And she loves you right back!   

Merry Christmas!
$C: You both look very charmin
$C: She looks like one of those cool grandmas that are way above your level but still humour you. 

But man, you are killing it with that bowtie! :D 
$C: This is truly beautiful. Thank you for sharing this.
$C: AHH shit, emotional rollercoaster. I thought you meant we *had* a good Xhristmas, like it's the last one you had with her. Heart sunk.

But no, just turns out she's an awesome gal and you love her. Heart rose!
$C: Great bow tie!
$C: You and your grandma earn my respect! Merry Christmas! :x 
$C: Man, I see the love of God in you and your grandma. It reminds me of my own. She died 12 years ago and I missed the funeral because I was away with the military. She was proud and looked at me like yours looks at you. Cherish that and never let it go. Be thankful always and honor her. 
$C: Tell your granma thanks for being such a great person. From: the world. <3
$C: And the award for most contagious smiles...
$C: Love cares not for genetic structure!
$C: Is that a Majora's Mask Hat!?!?!
$C: Yay!!
$C: Damn, this makes me really happy for you. I sadly lost my grandma the beginning of the year, she was my evrything aswell. Enjoy the time and somt foget to telö her you love her :) all the best man!
$C: Those are two smiles of true happiness. Merry Christmas. 
$C: This is awesome. 
$C: Godbless
$C: This reassures me that there are still things to smile about in life. Thank you for this OP.
$C: Your smiles alone speak volumes of the love between you two.   Have a Merry Christmas!!
$C: The look on your faces is pure happiness , love it!
$C: Idk why this makes me so happy. Maybe because I’m mixed race and I can relate to some of my relatives not having the same skin tone as me?
$C: ermahgerd I LOVE this pic!  what a great story :)
$C: I need more wholesome stories like this in my life :') 
$C: Happy holidays to you and Granma!
$C: The best story ever.  She is the best
$C: Merry Christmas. It takes one kind human to change the world! Tell your grandma thank you for bringing such light 
$C: Thumbs up for what looks like a Majora's Mask emblem in your hat.

$C: Merry Christmas!! So happy!
$C:  That smile is really the only family resemblance y'all need! 
$C: She helped you becoming the man you are today, don't ever forget that! Moving story!!!

$C: Y’all are so lucky to have each other. Love that you choose (rather than obligated by blood) is so powerful.  Best to both of you! 
$C: I love your smile. You both look so happy! 
$C: LOVE!
$C: Grandmas are a beautiful thing.
$C: Is that jumper pink and white or is it blue and gold?
$C: I dont wanna have to be the one to tell you this buddy, but you might be adopted.
$C: STOP CUTTING ONIONS!  *sobs*
$C: Merry Christmas! 🎄
$C: I saw this pic a few weeks ago saying you two met playing words with friends or something like that 
$C: You're Moss' long lost brother.
$C: This is Awesome! We need more grandma's like her! 
$C: Too many onions in this room I'm in.
$C: This post makes me happy. You two make me happy. What a nice way to end this day before bed :).
$C: Protect grandma at all costs
$C: Great story and great taste in games! Love the hat, my man!
$C: Please tell me you've written a screenplay. This is such an awesome story. Merry Christmas.
$C: Your grandma is the real super hero I wish more of us aspired to. Happy holidays to you and your family!
$C: Dammit who's cutting the onions. 
$C: This is fucking amazing. This is what we need so desperately in many places in the U.S. I hope we get to the point one day where interracial families and love relationships aren't even acknowledged as different and no one says or thinks shit.

I like to think I grew up relatively well adjusted to people of other races and religions being that I grew up in a predominantly black community. That being the case a lot of the people I associate with now, and a lot of the people I've called friends in the past have been mostly black people. I'll chill with anyone, but for some reason that's just the way it usually works out lol.

At some point the people causing all the racial issues in this country and around the world are going to have to either die angry or give in cause the world is changing and integrating whether you like it or not. :)
$C: This is such a good post, your Granma sounds like a great person and you must be too for her to get so attached to you. Happy holidays!
$C: Greatest post on Reddit ever.  Give her an extra hug for me, please.  
$C: Look closely at the hat..is.. that majora's mask?
$C: So I saw this posted earlier and just thought "aw he was raised by his grandma. How cute :)"

Didn't realize until seeing it the second time that they're definitely not blood related. Even sweeter. 
$C: you dont have to be blood to be family.
$C: This is exactly what I go to Reddit for. (Yeah right but) Merry Christmas to you and grandma!
$C: I went to school with this dude and he's a wholesome G always spreading the love. Makes me smile everytime he appears on the front page.  

Music block for life bro x
$C: I lost my Grandmother this year, and this reminds me of how much I miss her. You two look happy as can be. Hold on tight and take in every moment together!! 
$C: She looks OK with the deal...



$C: Came for the upvote for u/faris-hilton.

Stayed for the awesome Majora’s Mask hat!
$C: I envy you. Everyone hates my grandma and we were so happy when she left Christmas lunch early.
$C: Really lovely! What a wonderful Christmas picture of you & your grandmother.
$C: This is awesome. 
$C: I can feel your happiness through my phone. Have a wonderful 2018
$C: [removed]
$C: Get out anyone?
$C: Having a bad day, so I searched for this story. 

Now having a good day :)
$C: Thought she was your wife there for a second. 
$C: Get Out sequel 
$C: That hat is awesome!
$C: Hope you're having a happy day
$C: She kinda looks like a loving and affectionate Donald Rumsfeld.
$C: You kinda look like a black [Northernlion.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/youtube/images/e/ec/Northernlion_3.png/revision/latest?cb=20111212022512)
$C: That's amazing. You're a lucky fellow to have a woman in your life that is as caring as she is. She's a very lucky lady as well. 

I refuse to read down any further than the first 20 comments or so, I don't want this happy feeling to be ruined. 
$C: My Xmas sucked on a biblical level.   This is awesome to see.  All the best 
$C: As an adopted child, this story made me smile. Thank you.
$C: Granma for president 2020
$C: [deleted]
$C: Miss me with that gay shit
$C: This is beautiful. You're beautiful, she's beautiful, everything is beautiful and everything about this is pure and wonderful.
$C: Hey, this will get lost but I just wanted to thank you for posting this.

My son and I had a bit of a fight yesterday over stupid shit. Makes me realise how lucky we are to both have each other when you realise some people have struggled to find someone to care for them at the beginning. All the best.
$C: Fuck yeah man, posts like this make me still believe in human race. This world needs more Granma
$C: Merry Christmas you two!
$C: [First thing I thought of.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Px6eqcfLdzs) I know, I'm a horrible person. 
$C: Happy human holiday!
$C: So glad for you, and your Grandma ❤️

$C: This warmed my heart. 
$C: Lovely picture! I love your hat!
$C: I miss my grandma so much. I'm so happy you got to spend Christmas with yours.
$C: Is that a Majora's Mask hat!? 

(heart warming story btw)
$C: Looks to me like she feels the same way
$C: It’s always nice seeing a reminder that people can be good. It’s easy to forget in our crazy world. 
$C: Trigger warning to the alternative social justice warriors
$C: My Mom took me in when I was 6 years old and hung in, even though I was the craziest kid to try to raise.  She was 54 then and made it until I was 20 before she passed on.  No one had an influence on my life like she did.  I'm glad someone like her found you too.
$C: you look SO HAPPY
$C: Love to you both!
$C: I was raised by my granny too. High five bro.
$C: As a black man with a biological grandmother who was white I can relate to the confused looks gotten when walking down the street, P.T.A. meetings, etc.
BTW Chris Rock wasn’t the first person to school me to the difference between black folk and n words.
R.I.P. Granny.
$C: You are one wholesome person, I remember seeing another one of your post about your weight loss.

Wishing you and your grandma a wonderful Christmas.  
$C: This is a great picture and I can tell just from this she is a wonderful lady and y'all love each other very much :)

Also I like your hat :D
$C: This is fucking class, it looks like she raised you right too man, thats some gut wrenching wholesome shit right there. =)

$C: I am a little confused. What's the big deal?
$C: Follow her example OP. When you have kids make sure you stay in their lives - no matter how many different women you impregnate. I believe in you.
$C: So sweet

$C: Where you from? Granma looks like a loving Irish woman (looks like my parent's gran!) 
$C: Sweet Majora’s Mask hat.
$C: Merry Christmas to you both!
$C: Majoras mask hat on point. 
$C: I just lost my grandma last Monday and I'd give anything to see her again. I wasn't able to make the funeral and I will forever bear that burden. 
$C: Everyone's too distracted by Grandma to mention the sweet Majora's Mask hat.
$C: Now post a picture with your brothers Marky Mark, and Andre 3000
$C: I miss my grandma so much. Enjoy all the time you have with her and let her know exactly how you feel as often as you can.

This is a great looking pic! Merry Christmas.

$C: WHERE DID YOU GET THAT HAT. MAJORAS MASK!!
$C: I LOVE YOUR MAJORA'S MASK HAAAAT
$C: Majora's Mask hat is fly

$C: Simply beautiful. Thank her for being such a great human, ok?

$C: I love your Majora's Mask hat!

$C: [deleted]
$C: The happiness radiating from this pic is what it's all about. Merry Christmas!
$C: The comments will be locked soon... 
$C: I like her hat
$C: Seriously why the fuck is this at the very top of all? Dude could be an animal rapist child murderer, she could be an ex Nazi who killed Anne Frank, but we dont need to know anything besides the fact that hes black and shes white! I wish reddit would add a bullshit filter.
$C: Only has 90k upvotes cuz he's black and she's white.... yay petty upvotes! People would know this happens everywhere in their community if they'd simply turn off the tv and step outside once in awhile.
$C: See, Humans can be awesome to each other sometimes.
$C: This is on the front page because....? 
$C: Oh look upvote because black is still a thing 
  
Or is this upvote because benevolent white woman? 
  
Shits confusing. 
$C: She needs to stop feeding you soy milk.

$C: Grandma.
$C: Go back to Facebook 
$C: What the hell is this liquid coming from my eyes? 
$C: My heart cries tears of joy 

$C: I would normally downvote for backstory but it’s Christmas I guess
$C: Wondering why you don’t call her mom?
$C: I hate how racist some of yall can be over the internet.dude shared a picture with his grandma and the racist trolls just gotta come out the woodworks huh?
$C: I call my grandma ‘granma’ too - what’s your reason for spelling it that way?
$C: Don't answer if you don't want to. I'm simply curious. Those tax breaks can sometimes help.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I miss my grandma
$C: God bless her soul man.

$C: Batman?
$C: I love a man in a bow tie
$C: She's beautiful and so are you! Merry Christmas!
$C: I love your grandma too. She looks like a sweet grandma and you look like such a sweet grandson. The warm & fuzzies in this picture, man!
$C: I think this is getting more upvotes than the EA Star Wars thread got downvotes. 


So sweet and Merry Christmas!
$C: This is heart warming - so glad you found a chosen family and that you bring love and joy to one another. Merry Christmas and happy holidays to your beautiful little Family!
$C: Thank you for sharing. Stories like yours warm my heart. I am glad y'all are so happy together. 
$C: Just Beautiful
$C: You both look so happy together, what a beautiful story. That makes your grandma a hero in lots of people's eyes  (mine included ). If I could ask, why is "grandma" the term of affection you have for her? Did she have you always call her by that name, even before you got older and lived with her? Only curious, because I think it's such a warm and graceful way to refer to someone that raised you - sounds so much closer and lovely than foster parent. Not that foster parent is bad or is not to be appreciated, it's just that choice of grandma is so indicative of closeness. :-)
$C: As a fellow bow tie fan, nice bow tie!
$C: So... fucking... wholesome
$C: I'm a grown ass man, yet I'm tearing up. Got some sand in my eye. Christmas is no humbug, thanks for the picture and story.
$C: Hey man, I know you probably won't see this but I want to wish you and your Granma the very best. Merry Christmas and Happy new year bud.
$C: I've just been cutting onions, 
I'm making a lasagna,
(... for one)

Serious feels on this one I love it! Those smiles
$C: Sending my love to both of you.Looks like two wonderful people to me.😀
$C: Aw, man, I love you and your Granma! Happy Xmas! 
$C: I truly needed to see the love in this post that you put up for us to see. My husband and I want to adopt eventually and this just warms my heart and makes me want to pursue it even more. ❤️ Merry Christmas and thank you for sharing. 
$C: THOSE TWO BIG SMILES ARE THE CUTEST THINGS I SWEAR
$C: Awww.  Nothing more beautiful than to see a black person and a white person getting along.  
$C: Granma........
$C: If you’re going to wear sweaters and bow ties, there are certain rules you have to follow. One of them is called *proper grammar* and *correct spelling*. 

Here, you failed to spell Grandma properly. 

Bow tie privileges have hereby been suspended for one week, during which you will read the dictionary.

$C: Wow, Aaaand Xmas instead of Christmas, this is going to the top of r/all!
$C: Did anyone else think of Four Brothers when they saw this? 
$C: This thread is probably going to get locked. Which is a shame for such a cute picture 
$C: Okay, so I’m not saying that the story isn’t real or anything like that. But is it just me or does this pic look fake? Like the background looks like it was edited in and his hands especially the one around her shoulder look... I don’t know wrong. It may just be my eyes but this pic looks fake to me. But I’m not saying the story isn’t real. I’m just saying the pic might be.😂
$C: Your hands look photo shopped with her bright sweater as tge background, lol
$C: You look like will.i.am in a goodway
$C: Interracial generation gap love story is always nice. 
$C: Could be behind the scenes photo from "Get Out".
$C: And some people still think older whites hate black people
This provides proof for people like that
 Good on you and you grandmother 
$C: Sneaky aren't they? They always show up when I'm watching The Lion King. Always at the part where Mufasa dies too.
$C: You two are absolutely adorable. I'm so glad you had someone when you needed them.

But I have to say, I don't see the resemblance. :D
$C: How do we know you two didn’t swap places/ bodies and have been trying to swap back all these years 🤔

$C: Black man smiling? Have an upvote, kind sir.

$C: Thanks for not being a statistic.  (Not a bad stAtistic anyway).

Edit:  just so my meaning is not misconstrued:  I mean as someone who spent a great deal of his life in the foster care system.  But I guess it does come off as kind of judgmental or arrogant.  Sorry bout that.
$C: Sweet Majora's Mask cap. 
$C: sorted with controversial. i must say the comments aren't nearly as disgusting as I thought they would be!
$C: That looks nothing like Angelina Jolie...
$C: Thank God for Reddit being a place you can still see some good in the world. All the best to you and your family! And to the whole of reddit, happy holidays, whatever it is you may celebrate.
$C: if that was al franken hed be forced to resign again
$C: Looks like ya love her a little tooooo much! Lol. #handsy
$C: Only upvoting for the hat
$C: Not sure that I approve of any one raising someone to be a hipster. But I’ll give this points for being very heartwarming at Christmas time
$C: Not that i am against this at all...but my ginger, adopted mother would have never got as upvoted than this by her ginger adopted father 55 years ago today...
$C: If this were two people of the same race, this photo would have 0 upvotes. Simple facts. 
$C: Where's granma's d
$C: Only got so many upvotes because he is black and she is white who gives a fuck,if they where both white know one would be bothered 
$C: I wish more white people would be nice to black people

$C: “Oh, so that’s how it is in that family”, as I watch from the principals office as you grope Gramma’s left titty.
$C: I hate that family values are dying out. 
$C: You're 2 different races and you're hugging? Good job!!

$C: “The Seed is Strong”
$C: Your still drowning in Pussy I see.
$C: So if you're not related at all, calling her grandma is completely arbitrary and because she's old. Couldn't have called her your sister? Y'know, probably helps her feel younger.
$C: And I should know about this because...?
$C: Kevin Spacey was originally casted as Granma and was replaced by Christopher Plummer.
$C: Awesome lay huh ? I bet with that boob grab you got going on 
$C: Alright this pic is p cool because grandmas are nice and here is a respectable man hugging his grandma, its relatable! 

BUT these type of posts dont get popular just because of that. This particular post gained traction because people try so hard to be not racist that they end up being *subconsciously racist*

["**huurrrr hurrrr hurrrrr** POO POO PEE PEE black people **CAN** be good see!!! Look at how wholesome this BLACK PERSON is!!!!:DDD He and his grandma have a GOOD relationshship :DDD even though typically granmas HATE *black people* :DDD"](https://i.imgur.com/ISmAjBD.png)

$C: He's wearing a bow tie... Is that a Muslim thing
$C: Oh look more black and white propaganda
$C: You see, Trump isn't such a bad president. The Fake News would have you believe the entire nation is a bunch of sexist fake people trolls. Look, real people, just people.
$C: I was going for the Boyz ii Men look after seeing it on Always Sunny In Philadelphia. Couldn't find a white males cardigan anywhere so I had to improvise.
$C: Because,, bow ties are cool. - 11th Doctor.
$C: I dig that Majora's Mask hat
$C: Real talk though where can I buy that hat. 
$C: I love the Majorca’s Mask hat, it tops off the outfit perfectly! Merry Christmas to the both of you!
$C: Now that’s what you call swag x100
$C: Nice going against societal norms for free upvotes* is what you meant to say

$C: You win the "Most comforting story I've come across lately" award

Your grandma is amazing. And you seem so as well. 
$C: Good for you man, it’s always great to hear stories like these that work out! Merry Christmas  to you both 
$C: Someone needs to stop cutting onions
$C: I just lost my Grandma today. We were always very close, so I recommend keeping that bond and keep all your best memories alive as long as possible. 
$C: I honestly feel soo very happy for you. Life is very short, always cherish people in life who truly love and care for you. Many people aren't soo lucky to have such people around them. Merry Christmas buddy and have a great year ahead.
$C: 👦🏾😕+👵↗️🏡=❤️👦🏾😁
$C: This just makes me happy! I wish a wonderful and long life to the both of you! 

PS: Those damn onion cutting ninjas!
$C: You know what I really, really love in that photo?

It just *screams* love so loud and clear.
So damn cute you two- merry Christmas!❤️
$C: So sweet!!
$C: It's nice to hear such a happy story.  She must be an amazing person to do that for 40 years.
$C: That's beautiful man. Merry Christmas to you both. Best wishes.
$C: Glad to see you kept the hat too. 
$C: Wow! That’s so beautiful! Happy Holidays to you both! Reading this made mine even better. I hope y’alls next year is filled with everything good in this world. 
$C: Not crying. You’re crying. I’m not crying. 
$C: Who says reddit ain't civil? Super happy for you, please keep winning life.
$C: Such a beautiful story! I’m so glad you all found each other. More validation that when it’s my time to have kiddos, I’ll be adopting. 😍
Happy Holidays! 
$C: That’s beautiful. If there’s a case to be made for people being meant to find one another, this is a mighty strong one. 
$C: Thanks for sharing! Even just sharing your story has brightened up my day! Cheers! It’s nice to know there’s still lots of good people like you and your Granma in this world!
$C: Not crying... not cryin... aw shit. 
$C: Best post on Reddit today! Merry Christmas! 
$C: Thank you for sharing this story. Made my day. 
$C: Ok I'll admit I'm crying. Merry Christmas and may both of you have a healthy and incredibly happy New Year! 
$C: You and your grandma both sound so lovely :) Merry Christmas <3 
$C: What absolutely, incredibly beautiful people.
$C: I'm so happy you have her in your life and that she has you. Merry Christmas man. 
$C: Happy for you man. Merry Christmas. 
$C: Sounded like she needed you as much as you needed her. Anyways, I hope you two have a merry X-mas and a happy New Years !
$C: Who saved who?
$C: Sweet lady, you both look very happy!
$C: Aw man, that's a lovely thing to say. I hope you can stick by each other for many years.
$C: You can see she did a wonderful job raising you. 

You look like the best versions of yourselves in this photo.  Thanks for sharing.
$C: You've got a great taste in fashion, had to say it
$C: So happy for you!!! I think families of choice can be even stronger than families of blood. That's love right there!
$C: You're making me miss my grandma so much :(
$C: I don't need to read any more reddit today. This satisfied my need for Upliftingnews, aww, happy, and popular content all at once. Plus OP's replies are FUNNY. :D
$C: We all know grandma really just likes BBC.  Being Benevolent to Children.
$C: Merry Christmas. Great story!
$C: I love wholesome stories like these, especially on Christmas morning T_T. Merry Christmas to you and your Granma bro!
$C: I’m feeling a lot of feelings about this.
$C: Beautiful. Everyobe deserves the love of family, I'm glad you found yours.
$C: I'm so happy people like your grandmother exist, merry christmas!
$C: Awesome story and sweet hat! Yall are lucky people!
$C: Wow. What a lovely blessing that you both found each other. ❤️
$C: What a beautiful story!  I'm so happy for her and you.
$C: After watching all the shit on the news, you remind me that there are at least two good people in the world. Thanks to both of you.
$C: Omg made me cry!! Thank you for sharing such an amazing story!!!
$C: This got to me, that is just awesome of her... and you to share your story.  I felt moved to do something to help others and the people that care for them.  I donated to the [Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption](https://davethomasfoundation.org/donate/).  Happy Holidays!
$C: Your cap is so awesome, so much style all round!
$C: When is the made for tv movie of your life?
$C: I'm not crying, you are! She sounds like a wonderful woman :)
$C: You can't just adopt grandmas
$C: All aboard the feels train!
$C: Im glad people like her make the world a better place 
$C: If you don’t mind, I am curious why you refer to her as grandma rather than mother. Is it just age?
$C: Great story, and fantastic hat!!
$C: Which one are you, OP?


J/k. That’s an awesome story. Give her lots of hugs man. 
$C: Holy fuck this is beautiful

$C: Super cool. Merry Christmas!
$C: Thats fucking awesome, merry effing Christmas.
$C: Hell yes. A family bond that’s chosen is at least as powerful as one that’s hereditary. Merry Christmas to you both!
$C: So cool.  It's good to know there are still really, really, REALLY good people in the world.  Such a great story. You both are so lucky to have each other. 
$C: I’m very happy for you.  Merry Christmas.
$C: Your story made my day :’) Merry Christmas!!
$C: This is a wonderful story. Massive shout out to your grandma, mate!
$C: Im so happy for both of you, you seem to make each other incredibly happy, which in turn makes me happy. Happy holidays. <3
$C: God bless both of u 
$C: something something onions ninja 
$C: By far, my favorite story on Reddit in a long time. From my family to yours, we're happy for you and your success because of grandma. 
$C: My own family sucks so I I’ve reading about loving families at Christmas. So happy for both of you!! 
$C: Its like cutting onions in a dusty room..
$C: Majora's mask spotted
$C: Love is a powerful force.
$C: One of the most genuine smiles I have ever seen. 

You both look happy. 

Merry Christmas!

$C: Thats beautiful!!! Merry Christmas to you both 
$C: Aww, I am happy it worked out for you. I miss my grandma who died few years back. But she lived a happy life, saw her kids get older too and have their children and grandchildren. The bond you too have is strong and i wish you all the years with her. 
$C: Similar thing happened to me, though on a way way WAY smaller scale. Hope you did what I did and made sure everyone who said she wasn’t your “real” grandmother ate shit.

Merry Christmas to both of you!
$C: Full on sobbing! What a beautiful story! Merry Christmas to you both Xox
$C: You shut up with these stories 😭 why you do this man...

OP, I’m really happy for you. We need things like this in this cruel world.
$C: Oh my god I never cry but y’all are so sweet! 😭
$C: Merry Christmas. This is an awesome story to read on a day and shows what is truly important. 
$C: Its been raining on my face again. 
$C: I'm so happy you two found each other. Looks like you were just what the other needed.
$C: So great to know that she chose you!
$C: I’m hiding from my family (well, the kitchen really 😊) for a quick breather. Had to take a couple extra seconds to tell you how much this warmed my heart. What beautiful smiles and sentiments. Both are quite infectious. God bless you and Merry Christmas!
$C: I’m not crying. You’re crying!
$C: Yeah, that's fucking amazing man, a kiss on her forehead from me
$C: you both look so happy.  merry christmas
$C: I like to think that for every awful foster/orphanage story, there are more like yours. Give her an extra squeeze from the internet. 
$C: She sounds like an amazing woman, and you must be an incredible person as well to have made such an impact on her. 
$C: Seeing this is easily the best part of my day, it's so sweet and to see such genuine looking happiness on both your faces is just absolutely wonderful! :)
$C: I’m not crying you’re crying 
$C: Damn, seasonal allergies in the middle of winter!
$C: I am so tremendously happy for you and your grandma. Give her a big hug for all of us. She sounds like she is just the best.
$C: Da feels be like woah
$C: ❤️
$C: This was lovely to read on Christmas. Many blessings to you both!
$C: Merry Christmas! A remarkable story, thank you for sharing with us. It touched me to see your post. Take good care of that sweet woman and enjoy the holidays. 
$C: This is the most beautiful thing I have ever heard. 
$C: oh boy...hold it together...hold it together. 
$C: Wouldn't she be your ma than?

Why did she skip to granma?
$C: Damn onion cutting ninjas
$C: I would love to adopt a kid at some point. As someone said "You can't change world by adopting a kid, but you can change world for this kid". 
$C: Happy Holidays buddy! 🤗
$C: This is an incredible uplifting story, no matter the time of year.

However, this made my Christmas. Thank you.

May God continue to bless you and your Granma!
$C: I’m glad you guys have each other. Merry Christmas to you both. 
$C: This is a truly great story. Merry Christmas to you and Granma!
$C: I’m not crying I swear! 
$C: Best anime of the season. I cri Everytime... 

On a serious note, thank you for sharing your story. Excuse me while I cherish these emotions. 

P.S. Your grandma is awesome, but Monika still the best grill imo.
$C: Blood does not make a person family, love does! My stepdad raised me from the age of three and he loves me more than a blood relative would. Your story is beautiful and melts my heart. Merry Christmas!
$C: Aw so heart warming! 
$C: I was wondering that. Thanks.
$C: These types of stories are what keep my cynical ass from giving up on humanity entirely. Merry Christmas to you both!
$C: Your grandma looks just like mine. Does she also cheats when playing cards? :D Bless you! Have nice holidays sir with your lovely granny 
$C: Damn onions ..
$C: You're Granma is amazing. I hope you both have a wonderful Christmas! Much love friend 😁
$C: r/humansbeingbros. 

That is an honestly wonderful story. She's got a wonderful heart. 
$C: Ouch, my feelings.. So much feelings...
$C: Beautiful
$C: Do you call her GamGam? I really hope you call her GamGam. Or The Original Gamster is acceptable too. 
$C: Your grandma is now all of our grandma. We all love her as you love her. 

This is by far the best post I’ve ever seen. 

Merry Christmas!

Sincerely,
Fellow adoptee 
$C: So sweet - so glad for both of you - thanks for sharing!
$C: Thats so dope :). Also that bow tie lookin fresh!
$C: Cherish her for as long as you can. (I can tell you are).

My biological grandmother took me in after my mother passed (single mother, abusive household) and she gave me the gift of unconditional love and taught me how to have real empathy for others. I know I wouldn't be half the man I am without her.

She passed away a year ago right before Christmas and my life has been far more empty without her.

I'm glad you got to experience that love too. Cheers to both of you. I hope you get many more years with her!
$C: I love you, both! Merry Christmas!
$C: Sounds like you two were really meant to be family. Merry Christmas to you both!
$C: Oh my God my heart
$C: As a person who has many cousins and close friends who are not biologically related to me, family isn’t just about the blood you share. Great to hear that you are both happy, OP!
$C: Please tell her that I, a stranger on the internet, thinks she's a wonderful woman.
$C: My heart :’)
$C: I'm not crying; you're crying
$C: Goddamnit I'm literally crying this is so beautiful. You two are beautiful people and your love for each other truly shows. 
$C: Merry Christmas to you and your Grammy
$C: You both look so incredibly happy!
$C: God bless. This is so adorable. 
$C: Thank you for telling us your story. Just when I start to think that all humans suck I hear a story like this. I've got tears in my eyes now. Your Granma give me hope.
$C: Dude I’m crying right now because of this story. Merry Christmas, bro. Glad everything worked out so well for you! 
$C: That typo will cost you dearly.
$C: Haha Aw man you should've left the typo. I'm cracking up rereading it. 
$C: Such a sweet comment. I will not capitalize on your typo. 

I want to so bad. But I won’t. 
$C: This story made my Christmas so much better!
$C: The best time of the year
$C: He clearly grew up playing the best Zelda. That’s quality molding.
$C: ROFL, that sure changed the meaning of that statement.
$C: [Lay Lady Lay](https://youtu.be/Go2jbER0wk0)

$C: That’s really cute. 
$C: You are well on your way to reddit fame.
$C: Anyway that OP can get this for her nan?
$C: Awww the style of this is so perfect, really captures their obvious joy :)
$C: r/redditgetsdrawn

$C: Nailed the smiles. Nice one 
$C: Do you have a website? 
$C: You are an absolute angel! That’s SO sweet!
$C: Feel like his phrase is overused and outdated, but

U da real mvp.  
$C: Wow, that is amazing because 1. You are talented and 2. How wonderful that this story caused you to make art.  The soul is moved when art happens.
$C: How do I give reddit gold without having gold
$C: WE NEED A NEW WILDSKETCHAPPEARED.

YOUR TIME IS NEIGH 
$C: You are the best part of Reddit today. :) Merry Christmahanakwanzica! 
$C: Send it to OP to give to granma for xmas!!!
$C: Anyone know how to give gold on the Reddit app?
$C: Looks like an illustration straight out of a children's book. Looks amazing! 
$C: Great looking sketch! How much do you charge for a commissioned piece?
$C: You are rapidly becoming my favorite Reddit account! I love looking for your sketches in the comments. Keep up the good work 
$C: Oh this one got the onions for me.
$C: Beautiful!
$C: Lovely!! Please send it to them! <3
$C: Wow, bless you! This is wonderful for him to have.
$C: That’s pretty sweet
$C: This is so pure!!
$C: Wow you really have a talent for smiles/joy, such a cute sketch. 
$C: People like you make us see that there's still great people in the world 
$C: Love the smiles, so cute!  Kinda Ghibli-like.
$C: The hero we need
$C: Damn this is why I love Reddit. Makin me cry
$C: That is beautiful
$C: Oh my gosh that’s so cute 😍
$C: My God, who are you? That's amazing. Merry Christmas. 
$C: Awesome
$C: #I am in before the LOCK!
$C: It teaches the chimp to read?
$C: Your style is really nostalgic it reminds me of children’s books I read or something. Beautiful.
$C: Pretty sweet sketch
$C: Omg, that's amazing sketch mate. Keep up with the good work.
$C: That's so cute. Love those huge smiles.
$C: /u/Liyana_sketch this is just so frickin' awesome.  I think you just gave OP one of his best Christmas gifts.  I love it!  <3
$C: You’re a gem. This made me smile.

$C: Wow, nice!
$C: Congrats. Having a grandma is great. wish mine was still around.
$C: I love that style. Keep up the good work. 
$C: I evaded the onion-cutting ninjas until I saw this. Thank you for your good heart. 
$C: God this kind of stuff is frame worthy. What a beautiful thing to do!
$C: I love your art style!
$C: Something... something about the simplicity of that sketch evokes emotions inside me... I.T just radiates pure happiness.
$C: this sketch makes me so happy
$C: That amazing! Lovely touch :)
$C: Holy shit, I think I have the exact same watercolor set! 😄
$C: Fuck that's good
$C: I love you! You inspired me to make this my next hobby. I've been looking for a relaxing hobby to help me cope with anxiety. I think I found it! :)
$C: I bought that same watercolour set about 14 years ago and it's still amazing, I love those little sets!

Ps: cute painting!
$C: I’ve seen your work in various subs and it’s fantastic. Always makes me smile when I see a new one. 
$C: Oh my god. Trust reddit to punch this thing into overdrive! Sooooooo good. 
$C: This guy sketches. 
$C: I just wrote a comment explaining how!
$C: Like Jon Snow was taken in by Bed Stark. 
$C: *Happy holidays

FTFY
$C: Truly the best lay!
$C: For every awful person, there are 100 grandma's like this. They just don't grab your attention like the awful ones do. They don't make noise. They don't make grand gestures. They just put out their hands and their hearts and help the people nearby. 

You have to look for them most of the time.
$C: Do yourself an absolutely huge favor.  Go to your local volunteer fire house, blood bank, or charity get together.  Make friends with one person like this.  In a year you'll have dozens of amazing people in your life.  And you'll find yourself doing these sorts of things.  It snowballs.  
$C: Yes!!

Not to mention /y/Liyana_sketch, who posted a watercolor within an hour. 😺
$C: Seriously!! Stuff like this restores my faith in people. There is good out there.
$C: and then you read the comments making jokes and you start hating them again
$C: > Just when I start to hate people, I come across this post and it reminds me that people can be awesome.

Don't worry, from years of experience I can assure you that the hate will come back. You just need to be strong and weather through this dark cold night of joy and awesomeness. Keep the dream alive! Or the hope dead... either way works.

$C: i still hate people, just not this guy and his grandma.  yet.
$C: No, hedge. Gran gran is hedge
$C: [deleted]
$C: Retro-jammed
$C: She wears the hell out of that bowtie, though.
$C: The ol’ Reddit grandmaroo.
$C: "O, Bama, what a big black caucus you have."

"All the better to engage in participatory politics, my dear."
$C: Hey! It's what she identifies as so please respect it.
$C: Ahh, the ol' Digg christmasroo.
$C: This is some r/damngoodinterracial 
$C: I think the world would be a better place if we all had liberal white grandmas. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: How does dumb shit like this get upvoted
$C: Not sure if funny because of some obscure meme... or american education system failing you because you can't read the title and distinguish who is the speaker.
$C: Why would they fire her though? Was it her own personal money or the home/facility's?

I'm looking for jobs in social work right now and goddamn, the pay is awful for what is expected of you. My friend is making slightly more than minimum wage working with troubled youth (a lot of them have cognitive/developmental disabilities that lead to them having behavioural problems). To me, she should be getting paid at least 20$/hr. 

Social workers are so underappreciated and underpaid. 
$C:  Yeah I agree. Social workers are like the glue that holds our society together regardless of political identity and both political parties over look them. They don’t get enough credit or get constantly bombarded by people for not “doing enough”. (Or too much.)

 They need to get paid more, because they are also dealing with the worse and best of society.

 Beuarcratic red tape is the worse though. Shame your mom got fired, because when I worked with a kid I also gave him a good gift before I moved away. (With consent from his parents.)

 

  

 
$C: That’s so silly... “You may work with the children but you must never feel for them or give them anything...”
$C: Oh shit, I want that!!
$C: Love is a decent Band-Aid. Mele Kalikimaka!!
$C: Psst, I think he's the favorite.
$C: Sweeeet
$C: Cute!
$C: You. You are part of what makes Christmas special. Never stop. 
$C: My grandma always wrapped our gifts in the Sunday comics too. Good memories. 
$C: My grandfather did this from time to time. Love it!
$C: [deleted]
$C: Grinch here...and yes, it did.
$C: And break that measuring device
$C: Did nothing for me
$C: You seem like an ocean of love. This makes me respect you so much. I'm not very religious but I'd pray for you. I hope your wish is fulfilled by next Christmas. 
$C: Majora's cap 
$C: Majora's Mask!
$C: Why do you people love to tell everyone how much you cry over the internet? lol weirdos up in here. 
$C: I've yet to figure out why that's his thing
$C: I'm sure you already know this, but ungrateful foster kids are usually scared, hurt, damaged and figure that attitude will protect them from more of what got them there.

Good luck to you and your family. 
$C: That makes me sad to see a foster kid described as just an “ungrateful teenager” and to hear there are more words you would like to use.  This is a nice post so I won’t  say anything else but they don’t owe you gratitude.
$C: Lol, I found this comment when I did that.
$C: >people out there whom are terrified by race or have ideologies that we are not all equal?

these people are all over Reddit. They can't just be happy, ever.


$C: Okay, go live across the Anacostia river in S.E. Washington DC and get back to me. Or go backpacking through the Middle East as/with a woman wearing no hijab.
$C: What does "equal" mean in your statement?
$C: It belittles the scenario with the coddling tone. It is apparent that many people are not aware it has this affect on people. They are distracted by the actual racist comments and so automatically beleive they are defending a position of virtue. 

Be respectful, like the picture for what it is. Don't spotlight it as if it is something extraordinary. This is ordinary and does happen and should happen. Your ooing and ahhhing is condescending even if you are unaware of doing it. Even if your intention was good!
$C: HOW DARE YOU NOT APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY!
$C: No guess required. In response to the age of Trump, most decent people have decided it's a great idea to share and encourage expressions of love for each other, regardless of ignorance and bigotry and snide remarks. Happy festivus!
$C: Black guy and black grandma would probably get 10 upvotes and 20 racist comments.
$C: But it wouldn't get nearly as many comments by triggered racists if you sorted by controversial. 
$C: Jesus, what happened?
$C: Uhm but black fetisch is very rare, most white people just can't see themselves with blacks so people get weirded out when you see it in real life. I have only seen it on the Internet and and even then I'm like wtf. 
$C: You sound like an asshole...
$C: He really does.
$C: Lmao
$C: Tf he isn't Gambian lol
$C: Denzel from Bricklberry
$C: Thanks!
$C: Really? 75% its on the front fucking page! More like 98%.
$C: so?
$C: so fucking what?? 
$C: Let's say >85%...

$C: Le pickle Rick xDDD
$C: I call 'em the "Social Injustice Warriors".

$C: Yeah! The races should... uh... stay separate or something stupid like that!
$C: Yayyy a asshole being a cynical fuck on Reddit!!! Here's my downvote!!!
$C: [deleted]
$C: No big deal. A redditor shared his happiness with us and we are empathetic redditors who upvoted his joy because we appreciated experiencing a sliver of that joy via his shared photo.
$C: Stop, you're ruining the racist circle jerk in here.
$C: you shouldn't,
You should clap and upvote because it's a heartwarming picture 

$C: Many people do

$C: Hi Anna!
$C: That's a good point you have there. I honestly never considered the matter that way.
$C: Fuck that's good. 
$C: Don’t cut yourself on that edge man
$C: Found the racist asshole. Edit: yes, assuming peoples’ race based on their comments (which provide no supporting evidence) is also racist. https://i.imgur.com/YXX1FCg.jpg 
$C: Because it's awesome. You suck though.
$C: Because you were raised by racist assholes?
$C: Because it is heartwarming and simultaneously exhibits how far society has come in terms of racial diversity acceptance? 
$C: Honestly I’m a Trump supporting TD user and I think this is great. This is exactly the type of thing I wish we would hear more about. Way better than the “My conservative republican family member hates puppies” posts that have been popping up over the past few days.
$C: I downvoted this post to prove I'm not racist 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Much like the rest of reddit.
$C: [deleted]
$C: If it was just two white folks this post wouldn't be upvoted. Reddit is so predictable.
$C: You proved that you are racist by pointing that out - you saw a picture and the first thing you noticed was skin color lol.
$C: Ah yes, good thinking haha I’m tolerant. 

Also, fuck you whitey!!!
$C: r/DownvotedToOblivion 
$C: r/OnionHate
$C: Believe it or not, it's possible for people to think a post with a Black man and his White grandmother is cute and christmasy without it being about race.
$C: Your life must be so tough.
$C: Soy milk is very high in protein and leads to sweet gainz. A great part of a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle!

$C: He's just missing the d
$C: Haha why did this get downvoted? 
$C: Oh man his hand is slightly blurry because it's in motion, must be shopped.
$C: “Hey can I post a picture of us on reddit?”
Wow he pimped her out smh
$C: Why's it gotta be "pimp"?!
$C: Could you generalize your issue with this post? Do you dislike pictures of family members together?
$C: It's OK he gave her half of the points. 
$C: Looking at your post history, your attempt to troll and be divisive is pretty obvious. Its christmas, dont you have anything better to do?
$C: Black people were enslaved in America (reddit is largely American), and there is still disproportionately more racism against black people in this country than other races (except maybe Muslim now?) so the non-racist people like seeing signs that the racism is abating.

Is there anything about that explanation that isn't obvious? Serious question BTW.
$C: i read your question out loud and a bunch of dogs started barking
$C: I see racist comments everywhere and comments of disgust in black people like you would promote. So, that's weird.
$C: I'd say it is because its a glimmer of beauty in a dull and bleak world. This could be a Christmas movie its such a happy ending
$C: I’d say its the grandma. And you sir suck
$C: Why are you commenting on this an being dismissive? Because its a black guy thats why.
$C: The why the fuck bother bringing it up in the first place? 
$C: You're a moron. Did you even read OP's story about how he came to be adopted by this lady?  It's actually quite remarkable.
$C: LITERALLY. The tears are LITERAL.
$C: And dudes got a nice bowtie to boot! Grandma's love bowties!
$C: ...And?
$C: Extra reddit points

$C: r/DownvotedToOblivion 
$C: Minus 119, my dude. How you find such a socially regressive opinion on Christmas day. Hope you take some stock from this response.
$C:  Just because no one cares about you doesn't mean we don't care about decent humans. 
$C: even though it has over 30K upvotes... ok...
$C: https://youtu.be/4BIfFC3M2WY?t=2m12s
$C: Merry Christmas! 
$C: I really hope this is a satire. 
$C: "This young man keeps calling me his granma and insista on hugging me." 
$C: Why it matter tho
$C: It's funny that you think that's how black people talk
$C: Cut the crap karma-whore. 
$C: So participate in some threads.  Actually take part in them, the karma will come.

But if you're just begging for karma so you can start shit-posting for karma, well, get bent.  

Merry Christmas.
$C: He's actually caucasian! Hejust has a rare skin disease.
$C: Some are.
$C: 100k plus people who upvoted care, if you don't care then just keep on scrollin'.
$C: Bizarre amount of effort to put into such a meaningless question.
$C: He literally looks nothing like Kanye
$C: You sound like you love your life! 

I wish you all the best 
$C: And you're a cop! How many black men have you killed? 

Oh and I see that you also believe in God! Too bad you're probably going to hell.
$C: Merry Christmas
$C: Yeah. It super cute and sweet. But I could t help but to notice that too.  Wish his hand was a few inches further. 

Edit: further toward the shoulder not the other way. Not trying to be that guy. 
$C: huh
$C:  😂
$C: This.. Makes you cry? 
$C: [deleted]
$C: you're a misguided miscreant 
$C: What's your problem?
$C: Very relevant....
$C: Your comment only proves that you're an idiot.
$C: no im not
$C: > with Leftist agendas'

lol

Pandering on a few social-issues does not make a hypercapitalist, neoliberal war agenda "leftist".

$C: Have of BLM is white so your point is moot
$C: It blows my mind that you can see this and negativity comes to your thoughts
$C: Just go to Voat and quit whining.

Same format, fewer nice people doing nice thing.  You'll love it.
$C: You are not helping either.
$C: For that matter, why doesn’t he just go ahead and call her his daughter!!!!
$C: Um, he was probably adopted. He says she "took him in" in the title 
$C: what the fuck are you talking about?
$C: Wat
$C: I was gonna say nice Zelda hat. I was on the fence about your nerdiness with the bow tie and glasses, but the hat sold it :)
$C: Now I guess the last question is, can you go from flaccid to erect at will?
$C: Motown Philly's back again
$C: I love the look.

Cardigans are my favourite article of clothing...I am female but I make good use of both the granny and grandpa cardigans at the thrift shops.

One time though it was sad, as a lady had obviously just died, there were a bunch of her hand-knitted cardigans with her name label stitched in the back. They still smelled like a nice old lady's home.

What is a white male cardigan? I haven't watched enough IASIP yet to know if that's a reference :) What is the one you are wearing? White female? lol
$C: 1) you look great in it!

2) Motown Philly back again. Doing a little east coast fling. Boyz to men going off, not too hard, not too soft.
$C: Oh man, have I got some good news for you— there are no longer racial restrictions on who can wear which cardigans! There are no black men’s cardigan’s or white men’s cardigans or Mexican men’s cardigans— they’re *everyone’s* cardigans!
$C: The majoras mask hat is my favorite part of the ensemble 
$C: Just uh, make sure your ready for the singing contest alright? No beer or pizza.
$C: Can you please be my best friend? You're a lovely person.
$C: Hella slick! 

You both are super crisp
$C: Motown Philly back again! (Da da da da da da da da da da)
But seriously, what a wonderful woman she must be and what a wonderful man you must be. All my love to you two this holiday season. 

Ah fuck it, my love to you two always. 
$C: "like a cool Butler look"
$C: Single greatest reply regarding your fashion choice! 

Seriously what a wonderful and beautiful story! Merry Christmas to you and your Grandma. You both seem like amazing people and we need more people like the both of you in this world, and especially on Reddit! 
$C: You look very dapper!! I love the look
$C: That's probably my favorite Always Sunny episode
$C: Majora Christmas to you both!
$C: No one’s going to mention the awesome Majora’s Mask hat??
$C: I love you for this!!
$C: The whole look is very good on you. Also helps that you two look so happy. :)
$C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Only Christmas Miracle I see is that glorious Majora’s Mask hat Op is donning. Now THAT is taste.
$C: Turned out classy as hell, bro.
$C: So if grandma had any other kids she took in, would they be like, your sister? Or your sistah... or...

^man ^I ^hope ^people ^realize ^this ^is ^a ^IASIP ^reference..
$C: Philly Philly!
$C: Also, dope username bro
$C: It looks great always wanted one. Back in school we used to dream about it everyday.
$C: "It's so hard... to find a tie.. from yesterdaaaaayy."
$C: What are the rules?

Love that show, one of few shows that can bring up a serious subject without making it boring or preachy.

Also OP you look dapper as shit. Happy you didn't go for Charlie's outfit in s1e2.
$C: Well I think you look snazzy!
$C: Why did Michael Jackson call Boyz ii Men? 

He thought it was a delivery service. 
$C: Not too hard. But not too soft. 
$C: Merry Christmas! *whew, no typos
$C: I never realised white males wear different cardigans than black males 
$C: That louis vuitton?
$C: Seriously, what an amazing lady. So easy to get down on the world sometimes, but the really good people remind you what we can all be at our best. 
$C: That means a lot coming from an asshole like you.
$C: Yeah, seriously, whoever is doing it needs to stop. I'm trying to read all those lovely comments people are leaving and it's making me tear up.
$C: It's windy and there's dirt and stuff. I don't care that I'm inside!
$C: Bro these are some strong onions. I’m chewing bubble gum and it’s still menacing. >__> 
$C: I’m cutting red onions over here, so they’re just regular tears.
$C: DAMNIT DENNIS!
$C: Yep, someone's been running all over reddit cutting onions today. 
$C: blah blah blah onions blah blah im crying
$C: Heaven forbid we just admit something makes us emotional...
$C: I’m sorry.  Merry Christmas 
$C: DAE onions?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!

Why why why why does the comment section of a sentimental post ALWAYS have a giant useless comment train about onions and dust and big manly tears in your big many eyes?

Fuck you reddit.
$C: It's a terrible day for rain...
$C: As soon as I read the headline and saw how high it was upvoted, I knew the person the grandma took in was black. Reddit is so predictable.
$C: It's those damned ninjas again!

$C: cut them under water, it helps.
$C: [deleted]
$C: onions am make me cry
$C: What does this mean?
$C: Cut those onions properly please.
$C: Damn allergies... get me every time
$C: It's must been the sandstorm, I've got something in my eye. They are very common during winter here in deep north Canada.
$C: I’m sorry, I was making a lasagna...for one
$C: My allergies are acting up as well 
$C: I think we should get a petition to remove onions from all social gatherings 
$C: Someone cranked up the heat here because my eyeballs are sweating
$C: It's a terrible day for rain...
$C: Its just OP's grandmother making traditional Christmas dinner and pies in her kitchen.
$C: Who put this bowl of dusty chopped onions beside me as I look at this seriously heartwarming picture? 


$C: It's the vidalias too. And I think they are using the serrated knife again.
$C: [i'm not crying..](https://i.imgur.com/xZ1RsUE.gif)
$C: Someone needs to stop growing attached to their onions. 
$C: Yeah, but that other dude is throwing sand.
$C: The republicans.
$C: Like, seriously, how many onions are they cutting?! God....
$C: YOU'RE TEARING ME APART GRANDMA
$C: I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING
$C: I'm making a lasagna for one 
$C: Sorry as soon as I’m done reading the comments I’ll stop 😭
$C: My upstairs neighbor must have a leak because my keyboard is drenched 
$C: dude to contacts and perpetual dry eye, I'm immune to crying, however this pressure behind my nose is really getting to me. I love when people are happy like this.
$C: Serious question. Are you people actually crying when these "stop cutting onions" comments come up on reddit? I don't get it. I mean, I have emotions just like the next person, and I have and do experience all of them, but just reading something doesn't make me cry.
$C: I’m sorry for your loss, I hope your family all pull together today to be there for one another. 
$C: I'm so sorry for your loss! take care 
$C: You didn't lose her. You just can't call her up or ask her to make cookies anymore. As long as you have your memories, she's always with you. 

Edit: My deepest condolences. My comment is meant to help. 
$C: I'm so sorry. :( I'm glad that you were close to her, though. It's so hard to lose someone like that. Stay strong.
$C: Sorry for your loss, friend. ❤️
$C: I'm sorry about your meemaw. 
$C: Losing someone close around the holidays is extra tough. I hope you and your family can come together from this, and grow even stronger! Merry Christmas.
$C: My condolences. I lost my grandma 5 years ago yesterday, exactly 8 years after we buried my grandpa. I know it hurts especially with the holidays and all the mixed feelings, but hold on to your memories of her. My grandma was so sweet and kind, and I miss her every day.
$C: Im sorry for your loss. May your family celebrate the good times & great memories you all shared. 
$C: Hug.
$C: I’m sorry for your loss. 
$C: I'm so sorry. It's so hard to go through, especially when you're close.
$C: Lost mine a couple of weeks ago. I agree wholeheartedly with this sentiment. I'm realizing I've a lot of her in me, and it's helped me to be less sad.
$C: 17 years and it's still the same. Not constant, it is just less often. It feels exactly the same though when it is lol 
$C: So sorry to hear that! I hope you stay strong and cherishing great memories with her!
$C: Im infinitely sorry for your loss! I hope she rests in peace!
$C: 😭 Omg I’m so sorry for your loss. How heart breaking. 
$C: Have you looked under her bed? My Grandma was bad about hiding under hers every time I came over.
$C: Amen to that. Truer words have never been spoken. Merry Xmas and happy holidays to you!
$C: This is the first time emoji has made me emoji.
$C: Sneaky aren't they? They always show up when I'm watching The Lion King. Always at the part where Mufasa dies too.
$C: You cold bastard.
$C: same here! i'm really looking forward to improving my future children's lives by bringing them into a happy, loving home.
$C: The lady took the boy in after he was too old to stay in the kids home
$C: oh no
$C: Have my upvote you asshole. Merry Xmas. 
$C: This guy is the author of one of the better dick related copy pastas out there though.  Merry Christmas!
$C: Nephew..... Delete this
$C: Fuck 
$C: Amazing how one letter can completely alter a paragraph! Give grandma lots of love my dude! As for you, have a great Christmas!
$C: Hahaha
$C: Congrats on the love and kindness from a selfless, wonderful human being! They're as rare as the earth itself!
$C: Cost her?  She earned Reddit gold for that typo, and I missed it!
$C: Beloved _aunt_
$C: Hey, an awesome lady like her deserves to have a little fun!
$C: Denzel?
$C: Consequences were never the same.
$C: But grandma will still offer you cookies for the mistake and just laugh it off with a wink. 
$C: Dude you're hilarious. 
$C: probably why you don't act hood
$C: What’s so bad about lay?
$C: Can you tell us the story please??
$C: I mean for real. He/she broke out the pen and ink super quick and captured this emotional masterpiece 😭
$C: This would be a great gift for your Nan.
$C: I thought i was scrolling through my home page but it was just your post history. I thought reddit was doing a black guys and cat thing today. 
$C: Agreed, it's beautiful!
$C: now we just need a duel a la /u/shitty_watercolour, /u/shittier_watercolour and /u/awildsketchappeared


goodbye funny pencil man :'(

$C: Fuck that's good
$C: “Always look for the helpers...”
$C: <3 That describes my grandma. She is 91 now and people are always helping her. She said to me that she doesn't know why and I say that it's all the good she's done over the years coming back to repay her. 
$C: Remember aweful people are aweful because of themselves not because of anything you did.  It's either because of things they went through or something in thier brain.

It helps me some times.
$C: 😢 Someone's cutting onions. I'm gonna go call my grandma. 
$C: I'm sure this was a comment "in-passing", but this melted me mate. All the best to you for the new year - I could use more of your attitude around :) 
$C: It is...unfortunately the crappy people usually get the attention and that's the sad part. Just seeing this really brought a smile to my face and just gave me a wonderful feeling inside.
$C: I want to check it out but this post brought such a smile to face that I don't want idiots to ruin it...

$C: exactly.
$C: seriously?
$C: Oof, literally begging for downvotes 
$C: Not sure whether to make fun of you, or leave it well alone cuz you’re plausibly autistic.
$C: Personal money. I guess it was against policy.

Shes since found a better, more fun position. It involves elderly people rather than youth, but she still enjoys it.
$C: Unfortunately it's usually against policy and for good reason. Kids and teens aren't always honest what they need money for and a social worker isn't in much of a position to make that judgment call. It could easily be used for drugs for example, whether for their family that takes it from them or themselves. That means liability for the entire organization. If you want to help out, buy the item yourself and gift it to them is usually ok (I think)? Still, getting fired for a one time 20 bucks is dick from the employer.

Social work is most definitely underpaid and underappreciated and it sucks.
$C: Move to Australia and work here!

I'm a social worker and we get paid pretty well over here these days. The community sector used to be underpaid here too, but a law was made to pay us in-line with what people with similar responsibilities would make in other industries.

As an example, if I'm responsible for about 25 staff  (Disability Support Workers) these day, I'll earn closer to what someone earns at Coca Cola if they're managing 25 staff. Not the same, mind you... but a lot closer than before!!!

I work for a small Non-government organisation, but if you work in a government role, you'll earn about $110k AUD/yr, which is about $85k USD per year.
$C: I think she had been told that she cant give money to kids because it can create dependency. 

Honestly though, its still shitty. Rules and rules but come on, a kid trying to make a connection with their recovering-addict parent is a whole different story.
$C: Yeah its really shitty. My brother and I are in our 20s now so my mom didn't have to spend much on us for presents, so she payed it forward to one of her kids. Ended up jobless because of it. Kid wrote her letters apologizing and ended up paying her back within a month or so.
$C: Haha. My wife says it’s a close call. 
$C: Me too. And I forgot,so thank you both for the memory.
$C: That was a .... smart decision. 
$C: It's a real thing. It's called [Gerontophilia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerontophilia)
$C: I do and that's why we gave her even more hugs today than usual.  We are far more blessed than she will ever be but if we can give her even a slight chance of getting what OP has then we consider it a success.  Sure isn't an easy ride though :)
$C: I just do not understand. Hate is a terrible thing. 
$C: A human, not matter race, sex, or religious beliefs is still a human. 
$C: Equal treatment under the law. Equal treatment under the social contract.
$C: Truth.
$C: Said I need to get a job and pull my own weight. I havent been able to get one though because I have been taking care of him (he's in bad health). We yelled at eschother and I'm kicked out.
$C: You have only seen interracial couples on tv?
$C: You should go to Phoenix, AZ. Lots of interracial relationships there.
$C: You sound like a retard
$C: Good. Aim for your keyboard.
$C: Nope, but thanks for letting me know I can sound like I'm doing it. :)
$C: Thats an alternative too
$C: Want to know why racism is still so huge in America? Because of people like you. Instead of glorifying the fact that a black person and white person are fucking standing next to each other, why don’t you just see it how it is; two people hugging. You CANNOT tell me this post would get 100k upvotes if they were both black or white. 

E: close to 200k now
$C: good for you buddy, you feeling a sense pride and accomplishment yet?
$C: No, we're offended by the fact that it gets upvoted and circlejerked to death because of that.


$C: Noice! I'm visiting my mom, haven't seen her in 2 years. She is still in the same sad cycle of poverty and confusion. I'm glad there are people out here. I found out today a friend of mine is struggling with a severe drug  addiction. I still love them. I'm glad we can all stay positive.
$C: i bet my left ball if they were both white it wouldnt reach 60k+ upvotes though
$C: His heart isn't warmed because all he sees is the difference in skin color.
$C: Agreed! I think this is adorable. 
$C: Ok 👋🏻
$C: Christ what a racist shithead
$C: That wasn't really racist
$C: None of that was racist. He said white AND black lol.
$C: he really enjoys using his time to find people 
$C: It's a fucking picture of two people you don't know. It's a shitpost.
$C: Well if we're going on content alone, its a picture of two people smiling, nothing more. Am I wrong?
$C: Do you guys even know what racism is anymore? 
$C: How does that make him racist? People toss that word around like candy.
$C: You’re assuming he was talking about race? Racist.
$C: See this is acceptable. No smug shit. Just straight forward as you can be. I don't appreciate racism and I think it is a huge waste of human time but if you're gonna be racist, don't be a bitch at the same time lol.
$C: Yeah I'm sure you've met most of the "rest of Reddit" so you must know exactly what kind or person each user is!
$C: It would have none.
$C: Noticing skin color isn’t racist. Making assumptions based on skin color is.
$C: That's the only reason this is on the front page.
$C: [deleted]
$C: They’re taking away my internet points ;(
$C: I doubt it, this is Reddit after all

$C: Color put this pic on the frontpage, if it was a couple of white people (or black people, or purple people), nobody would have given a fuck.
$C: Of course time moves more slowly in space, so Gramma is Laurel Lee?

But to answer your question, yes. I'm actually doing it right now.
$C: Not too hard, not too soft
$C: Boyz to men going off, not too hard, not too soft!
$C: You can't?
$C: Flaccid II Erect
$C: Dah dah dah dah dah dah dah daahh
$C: I think he means a men's cardigan that is white in color, not a white-male's cardigan.
$C: http://classic.motown.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Boyz-II-Men.jpg

Men’s white cardigan :) 
$C: > Cardigans are my favourite article of clothing...I am female but I make good use of both the granny and grandpa cardigans at the thrift shops.

Pockets.  A good cardigan will have nice, deep pockets which serve as a much-welcomed complement to all the under-pocketed items in our [female] wardrobes.  Invariably, a male cardigan will have pockets, and grandma/grandpa cardigans are likely to have pockets too (for holding tissues and cough drops!), but cardigans made for younger women are hit-or-miss.

Pocketless cardigans are the work of Satan himself.
$C: Dadadada dada dada da
$C: Thank you for bringing me out of my post huge piece of French Silk Pie sugar crash that apparently makes me quite unaware of anything but the Death Star light thing I got for Christmas atm. 

I couldn’t figure out the not too hard, not too soft. I was like, typical penis talk on Reddit; have an upvote. NOW, I remember the music and some of their songs were the ones we would listen to after a breakup or just emo. Move it along, nothing else to see here.....
$C: I am a woman and I wear men's cardigans!
$C: All cardigans matter
$C: Love me, love me, say that you love me...
$C: Not sure if you’re joking, but I think he meant a white cardigan for men.
$C: They ruin every single reason I have for hating this planet.
$C: oh come on, he's not that bad. asshole_278 is far worse
$C: I just have something in my eye... that's all it is 
$C: Merry Christmas man, to you and your Grandmother. 
$C: Thank you for this post. I’ve been reading the news all morning and this post offered a much needed reminder that there are wonderful, loving, selfless people out there doing great things. You’ve inspired me on this Christmas morning to follow in your family’s footsteps. 

Seriously, this post sent me over the edge! LOL 
$C: ;_; this is too precious. this is the best picture ive ever seen because yall just look so earnestly happy
$C: I'm not crying, I'm making a [lasagna](https://youtu.be/-pVT_mvvZLo?t=52s). 
$C: This response hit me harder than the picture.
$C: If there are two things I enjoy in life it's onions and beautiful stories.

Today I received both, Merry Christmas to everyone!
$C: I just can’t upvote everyone enough. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: My nose is so stuffed up from crying at how sweet this is I can’t even SMELL the onions!
$C: that fucking smile my guy XD beautiful picture hope u guys have a good xmas.
$C: Tear up, tear up, or both. I’m battling with some waterworks here myself. Leaky plumbing, maybe?
$C: I wish someone could cauterize my eyes right now...they are leaking 
$C: All this Christmas is making me tear up or something
$C: I'm not crying. My eyes are sweating!
$C: Bloody hell those onions are so strong
$C: SEE I TOLD YOU IM NOT CRYING YOUR CRYING
$C: You both look so happy. This makes me smile. Cherish her!!!
$C: Well, somebody needs to say it...  

Nice hat.
$C: just sort by controversial and you can balance out all that love with some nice hate too.
$C: Hey, youngblood. I like the way you show appriciation. You granny sounds amazing But so do you! Sorry the loss of your parents happend But im guessing you Could not have gotten a better carer/parent! Life finds a way man, it always do. Happy holiday My brother.
$C: Post this in r/wholesomememes too. 
$C: *You're* making *us* tear up! Merry Christmas, OP! :)

Also: that's a bomb Zelda hat. Is Majora's Mask your favorite? I gotta say it tops Ocarina of Time for me, but is equally as favorite as Twilight Princess. I just can't pick lol.
$C: I love you. Am I doing this right?
$C: The recipe calls for red onions, but all I have are white onions, so that's what I'm chopping.
$C: Hey man for 2.2k internet points I’ll take it
$C: Dude it’s a joke
$C: Rody? is that you? can you tell upload a better version of the bloodmeat music video to youtube? 
$C: Calm down, grinch

is only joke. Why you heff to be mad?
$C: Me too

Power to us
$C: Generally, cutting onions causes you to cry

It’s a common reddit joke to say someone is cutting onions when you’re emotional 
$C: Its just people repeating a tired comment to feel like they're part of a group
$C: Nah I think it’s just a nice jovial way of saying something is cute
$C: In our case it’s the family sauce, but fortunately I already made it this year and was able to share it with her loved ones today. Felt good. 
$C: Thanks friendo. 89 was a good run and it was good to be surrounded by family. 
$C: Thank you soo much.
$C: Great story behind the pic, and I'm glad you get to spend the holidays with your family.  Also, love the hat mate.
$C: You’re feeling emojinal?
$C: :‘D. Have a beautiful christmas and tell her from reddit what a beautiful soul she is! 
$C: The by also gave companionship to an old lady, is I think what he was getting at.  
$C: It was a play on those bumper stickers for rescued dogs. Supposed to be funny. 0/1 for today folks
$C: One of? Kayjay is a master of dick copypastas
$C: Or just leave it since it's really funny
$C: aka awesome lay.
$C: This had me laughing so fucking hard, OP seems like such a cool genuine person. 
$C: I too love lays
$C: >Give grandma lots of love my dude! 

Not that much though...
$C: The unbridled power of a single D
$C: > Amazing how one letter can completely alter a paragraph!

Is there a subreddit for this?
$C: You know there are all black families living in places that don't act hood, right? Like African American black, in the USA, growing up in not hood culture.
$C: Wow. Would you have said that to a white person?
$C: You know... the implication.
$C: I just wrote a comment explaining how!
$C: Love your username btw!
$C: Also /u/motivatinggiraffe 
$C: Me too? Something about the 5 o'clock shadow 
$C: OP is more than one woman?
$C: Is OP plural?!
$C: Whooooppps!
$C: You're welcome! 
$C: Meta in the same thread. What is this, /r/askreddit?
$C: M  E  T  A  E  S  T  H  E  T  I  C

After gran-gran, that is.
$C: Incredibly adorable
$C: HA!  Awesome stuff.
$C: Her daughter ensexed a brother, and this is how she became his mother of grand.

This should be a normal thing and if anyone has a problem with interracial breeding, you should meet people from the group you used to hate. Lots of them. If you meet 1,000 white people and one's a dick, it's a drop in the bucket. If you meet 15 black people and one's a dick, it seems more significant. Up the numbers and it tends to even out.

You also gotta factor in habits. You programmed yourself to hate them for a good, long time, and it's gonna keep going for a bit, just because of momentum. Your job is to not add to it. Notice when you find yourself thinking in your old ways, be nice to yourself about it, and gently remind yourself how you'd like to be instead. You've heard of death by a thousand cuts? This is happiness from a thousand smiles. One, two, or twenty won't do it. Make it a regular thing and let the numbers get big enough over time. 

Find some random, inanimate objects. The more mundane, the better. A pencil. A plain coffee mug. Now, viciously berate the mug. Be as mean and toxic as you possibly can. Dig in to that thing for a solid two minutes, like you're actively trying to be so awful to it that it commits suicide. You will feel like shit. That's one good reason not to hate--it makes your day worse. Now give the mug overflowing messages of love and unconditional acceptance. Let it know how much it means to you, and that you appreciate it more than it can ever know. You will feel great! That's one good reason to be great to people--it's the secret to the good life. 

You can get creative. Pick a white person and imagine they're black. See if anything changes in your head. Pick a black person and pretend they're white. Notice internal changes. Mix n match whatever other races you want.

Exhale fully when you remember to. Holding your breath is bad for you. It's part of the cycle of feeling bad. Finishing an unfinished exhale weakens the cycle. 

Most of all, the change you're going through is exactly what the world needs more of. I can't tell you how wonderful it is to read your post! Once things are sorted out for you, please help others do what you did. You will save lives.

Thank you.


$C: Cursory link request. 
$C: Grambo
$C: It’s a reference to Its Always Sunny
$C: You write "because" as "cuz" you are autistic lol. You just proved my point of you failing the system. And you are a racist, if he was a white guy, would you have said "young white man?". Doubt it.
$C: Oh for sure. I totally understand that but idk, terminating someone's employment seems kind of extreme. I get the home/agency/organisation can't have that kind of liability on them. 
$C: That’s so sad for all involved. Sounds like a sweet kid too
$C: I'm so glad to hear it. You're right, it's not an easy ride, but well worth it, in the end. Good luck and stay strong! The world needs more good foster parents. 
$C: They're not worth anyone's time.

Merry Christmas!
$C: Who is arguing that sex and religious beliefs change the existence of the species Homo sapiens? In regards to race, one can argue for sub-species/groups but even that doesn't challenge the broader species category.

Your statement seems meaningless because you haven't specified how humans are equal - you simply state that they are.  I'm sure you can agree that not everyone has the same capabilities for strength or intelligence  so what do you mean by equal?

  
$C: I believe you mean well and I agree that in an ideal society people would be treated mostly equally - some exceptions being the mentally ill/disabled as more group resources are generally required to not let them die.  However, the comment i was responding to says "are" not equal, not "should" not be equal - and simply recognizing we aren't equal cannot possibly be wrong.
$C: No, I have seen some IRL. Never black people with other races 
$C: No thanks, I prefer to see normal couples
$C: I’d rather see posts about racial harmony get circle jerked over than anything that promotes a race war.
$C: [deleted]
$C: It'd be one of countless images at 20 or less.
$C: Why would you care, though?


Can we drop the cynicism just for one day?
$C: I think the race aspect of it *is* part of why it’s so heartwarming.

A whole lot of us come from parts of the US where racism’s still grossly alive, and were around a lot of people growing up that really were real assholes about race. The pictures already cute, but the obvious interracialness of it makes it even nicer because you know the relationship A - was one the grandma *chose*, as this kid obviously wasn’t born to her, and B - one she chose despite having grown in a time when you can bet your ass she was exposed to a ton of racist-as-fuck shit. Despite the fact that there’s still stigma about interracialness in this country.

So yeah. For me a part of the reason I gave the picture a fake fucking internet point was because of the race aspect. I think it adds to the beauty of the photo.
$C: Probably becasue it makes it clearer he was taken in. Two completely different people being brought together, what's wrong with that? You are right for the wrong reasons. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: What if they were both black?
$C: So this is how you spend your Christmas. Nice.
$C: Why do conservatives always have to bring up race?
$C: [deleted]
$C: You should see the difference though, there just doesn’t have to be any anger in it. It’s fine and good to realize the reconciliation and healing this picture represents. Ignoring color can lead to people also forgetting the past and the present issues hat do exist. Love this picture, it’s great to see anger replaced with love and people seeing past color while not ignoring it. I’m not saying you are by the way, you only wrote a sentence, I just know some do.
$C: As opposed to all the pictures of people I do know that show up on the frontpage? Sorry, do you not know how the internet works? 
$C: I'll explain. He's insinuating that it was upvoted to the top because he is black, she is white, and reddit is mostly filled with liberal social justice types who will drop a Macho Man elbow from the top rope onto the upvote button.

But yes, on top of that, it is also a lovely picture of two beautifully happy people, and will get those upvotes as well.

In reality, it was a mix of all that bullshit. Or it wasn't. Who gives a shit. Lets have some whiskey together.
$C: You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
$C: you know he was, don't act silly 
$C: "you guys are racist for pointing out my racism" - a piece of shit lonely loser
$C: I don’t have to meet everyone on this site. I’ve been on here long enough to know the main demographic and how a lot of these people think. It’s not very hard. 
$C: If someone looks at me and assumes I get sunburned easily they aren't being racist. 
$C: No. That’s called prejudice. We use the word Racist too much
$C: In a way,  he did make an assumption based off of skin color. He could've just upvoted it but instead  he just HAD to point out exactly why he upvoted it.
$C: Uh, no. Racism is the discrimination if someone based on their ethnicity/colour of their skin etc. Assuming everyone is from similar backgrounds is not racist, not even remotely. If you water down the definition of racism you take away from the signifgance of saying the word. Don't do that.
$C: You think everyone else makes things about race, but it's you dude. It's you.
$C: Nah, just your comment. If your go-to response to seeing an interracial family is "People only care about this because he's black", the issue isn't the family or the people who care about them.
$C: But tough enough where you became a contrarian to feel superior. 
$C: TIL East Asian men all have boobs.
$C: "virtue signalling" Is a virtue signal lmao
$C: >but they've been banned on most subs

LOL.  So you're evading bans.  You're just a real winner then.  

Got it.

$C: His NSFW comments are funny af
$C: He's a certified Reddit Investigator. 
$C: there are more white couples adopting minority kids because you don't take a kid if you're impoverished and it's more probable that you are an orphan if you were poor


[here](https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/black-families-adopting-white-children/) is an website about adoption talking about black families that adopt white kids, the part about "Why Aren’t More Black Families Adopting White/Hispanic Kids?" may interest you, reasons include: 

> Depending on the agency, it may cost more to adopt a white baby.

> Proportionately, there are more African-American children in foster care in need of families.

> Not wanting the hassle/risk of being thought of as the nanny or kidnapper of the child.

$C: The answer is that it does happen but you've not heard about it, or you've ignored it because it doesn't fit your narrative. I have seen it happen, and I personally know a black couple who adopted a white teenager. 

I think you're insinuating that one group is more compassionate than others, when the truth is that one group has historically been more advantaged (at least in the U.S.). You don't take in a kid if you can't afford to. 

There's your answer. Merry Christmas. I hope you don't spend the rest of it asking stupid questions. 
$C: You may be right. I wouldn't give a fuck either way because it is SHIT CONTENT. Objectively speaking: without the back story it's a picture or two people smiling. It is a NOTHINGBURGER and we're all getting sandy tits over something utterly silly 
$C: Gramma is a real person living today. Laura Lee was a fictional character on a TV show that was broadcast on CBS from 1989-1997. Urkel was also a fictional character on that same TV show.

I'm glad I could clear this up for you. If you're still confused, consult a psychologist. 
$C: Totally brotally totally totally

$C: You...may need to get off of reddit, then. I only foresee pain in your future
$C: If you get so hurt over those phrases to the point that you reject other people's happiness in family, you might need some professional counseling.
$C: Did you read further or stopped at this?

I say, boy! I say! 

>I don't actually want to censor you; I want to convey a message and a feeling. 

$C: Yes, those pesky liberals with their "family values". Totally.
$C: Ain't liberal. I'm more conservative, but like fiscally and more neutral on the rest of things. 

Just don't like coded-racism and bullshit like that. 
$C: Oh, eat it, we (the three of us here...) know we're talking about the USA. 

Yes, countries in Africa or Asia are *OMG* not predominately white. 

There is no real racist movement/racism against white people in the USA. This ain't anti-apartheid South Africa, OK? Being a white male in the USA right now is still one of the most privileged positions in the world - that isn't to say people can't be racist against whites, what I'm saying is: 

a) white people are not disenfranchised in the USA 

b) overwhelmingly there is no direct dissent towards white people as a whole 

c) most USA states are at least 75% white, with a lot of the 'heartland' to be in the 80-85% range so there is no threat of whitey disappearing any time soon.

d) the outliers, the crazy people that claim white people are evil/need to die/etc. are crazy. See: Crazy Fucking People, 2010, Chapter 6, pages 270-275. Also see, Westboro Baptist Church

p.s. comments about 'diversity' like OPs are fucking code-word for being annoyed as a white person about something involving race. 
$C: That's great and fine, still it has no place in this post or thread as is irrelevant to the picture and story.
$C: [removed]
$C: Wait, where *are* white people “the dominant race”?
$C: My point is you're inflammatory for no real reason. You're just a schmuck. Reddit... the world needs less of people like you. I hope you change and learn to live a little bit.

I don't actually want to censor you; I want to convey a message and a feeling. 

Edit: Also, I don't downvote people. So don't downvote me, schmuck.
$C: If the original post was a new theory, and your opinion was a peer review of that theory, and everyone else's downvotes were a further peer review of your research, you'd probably assume your take was wrong, right? Like, your opinion you'd assume was probably way off base after everyone else's peer reviews right?

Assuming your negative review is right because it must speak some shameful truth is an emotional defense mechanism you need to learn to think past.

Your deletion of your peer review also speaks volumes of you confidence in its accuracy. You don't need to feel shamed by it, it's an opportunity to learn and evolve from the worldview. 

Hope you have a merry holidays.
$C: You think it's just randomly messing up grammar, but it actually is just a new syntactical structure that pretty much conveys the same information in a different way. It's called AAVE and you're not even imitating it well. You obviously do not expose yourself to much... actual black culture.
$C: Why mock? You said it yourself you don't care.
$C: You're wrong on both counts, but hey, you seem fun.
$C: *Articulate*
$C: No, you're whining.  And nobody really cares what you want.

$C: Love your pic merry Xmas but serious question is it worth it to buy the Switch just for BOTW? I haven’t played any Zelda games in years but I really want to and am considering 
$C: Actually fell for it T_T
$C: ITS SOOOO GOOD. I really recommend picking up Splatoon 2 also. I don't have internet but I've been plying it everywhere I go with internet and it's great.
$C: Best game I have ever played.  Been playing pretty frequently since August, only 26.8% finished.

$C: Thanks for clearing this up. Thought maybe I was missing out on primo white guy wear. Saved me from an embarrassing conversation with a store clerk.
$C: oh like the color of the article of clothing... 
$C: I don't think any of mine have pockets actually.

I always have my little purse.
$C: Now that's too far
$C: It was a jokey joke
$C: Ikr?  These people need to stop being so genuine and kind so that I can reasonably justify my hatred of the world.
$C: Oh come on, he's not that bad. asshole_277 is far worse
$C: I thought asshole_280 was worse
$C: I have something in both my eyes.
$C: I'm not crying... It's just been raining on my face...
$C: Im not crying you're crying

$C: I hate when it rains and you get a drop in your eye. 
$C: I have really bad allergies and the pollen count must be incredibly high today...
$C: >look so earnestly happy

They're just gassy.
$C: For 2
$C: Can I have some too? 
$C: Thanks for reminding me about this!
$C: I’m not crying my eyes are sweating
$C: It's ok. I got really angry there too. I lashed out a lot because sometimes you can feel trapped and alone there. I got lucky and found those who loved me for who I am. I know that not everyone can be as lucky but if you keep an open heart, it can happen.

I would seek counselling and try to keep myself as occupied as possible. Remember that your stay there is not permanent. Once you leave you will realise how different life can be once you have control of it.

So if you can, take it from me. Try and direct that rage into something positive, I play guitar and can play some sweet solos because of it. Find your thing and keep at it. You'll be out of the system before you know.

Just please don't do anything that can ruin your future. It so easy to cave when you don't think much of yourself and feel like your actions have no real consequence because they can and they do.

Sorry for the rant but I really hope it helps.
$C: That sucks I’m sorry :(  If you could write an instruction set to new adoptive parents on what to do and not to do to help you, what would it say? I wish you could come live with me! Merry Christmas. I promise things absolutely can and will get better because very soon you will be old enough to build yourself any kind of life you want. And that advice from OP was straight gold 
$C: Like I said
$C: Not rody lol, just a fan who signed up for reddit before there was a large userbase and was aw to snatch up the name 
$C: I mean, yeah it’s a joke. But it still feeds into the concept that men shouldn’t show emotions. So while it’s (mostly) harmless, it’s one of the many things that I could totally stand to lose. 
$C: Its not remotely a joke, its a "hey everybody I know what everyone says every time so I'll say it for upvotes, no one be original, or just talk like an adult about emotions, just circlejerk!"
$C: Can it really still be called a joke when it's been repeated 1000 times?

$C: What
$C: You have to be trolling. No one is this retarded. I don't believe that you think he's racist either.
$C: Yeah, totally agree. Firing someone is life changing for them. Doing it over 20 bucks that were given out of kindness and love is just fucked up.
$C: Merry Christmas to you as well!
$C: I read OP's comment more carefully. I believe morningtrain is referring equality as individuals, that see each other as equals. In his eyes, and my eyes, we are all equal in that sense.

$C: So you have NEVER seen a black person with a white person before?I guess you must live in one of those areas we like to avoid then
$C: He doesn't care that it's true, he cares that people pretend that it's not true

I'm inclined to agree. Let's be honest about the fact that we like to see pictures of happy people from groups that have shall we say, some "tension" between them.
$C: I think the two people pictured are great, but people care because reddit is very dishonest and transparent. 

Long ago reddit was more or less honest, and for those who can remember it kindof hurts because its like losing a close friend to hard drugs. 

Front page doesnt display what people upvote, it displays whatever reddit wants to be there.
$C: Why should I not?
$C: What’s cynical about it? It’s nice to see something wholesome in an area that has seen a lot of tension. 
$C: Well you don’t know what his opinion on it is yet. He just said it wouldn’t reach 60k and I agree, that doesn’t mean he thinks it’s a bad thing. 
$C: i have that shit subreddit filtered the moment filtering came out so try again
$C: proof?

edit: lets see if i can get to -100 downvotes without proof. Go Reddit Go!!

edit2: I ask for proof on a post highly critical of T_D, and they delete their post. Noice.
$C: What? I also agree that it probably wouldn’t get as high if it was too white people, that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be upvoted though or it isn’t a great picture. It’s nice to see race barriers broken when places like T_D are so prevalent online unfortunately. The original commenter that started this thread was definitely trying to say it was a negative though, it’s not, but that doesn’t mean the base of what he’s saying isn’t true. 
$C: >celebrated

You spelled ‘detested’ wrong
$C: new years is more celebrated where im from anyway :^)
$C: Um...your link is two pictures both with one white person and one colored person...I'm not sure what you think you're proving
$C: >Ignoring color can lead to people also forgetting the past and the present issues hat do exist.

Ignoring skin color means seeing people as equals. When you see people as equal, it becomes exceptionally apparent when someone is not being treated equally. 


$C: >	reddit is mostly filled with liberal social justice types

This is a blatant lie lmao. Reddit is only second to 4chan when it comes to the largest alt right hangout spots.
$C: What a fucking bully, didn't know you could sink this low.
$C: Yes I'm sure the main demographic on here is racists neckbeards. Get real lol. To make an assumption on such a large amount of people based on what you have seen on Reddit is stupid and shows that you have no real grasp of the real world.
$C: I think the original comment this is all in response to was dumb and unnecessary.. But, racial prejudice would be assuming something based on skin color. Noticing skin color is not racist or prejudiced, it's being able to see and tell the difference between skin tones. 
$C: I believe the comment is a commentary on why the post has so many upvotes
$C: You’re kind of a dick, huh
$C: Reddit makes things about race everyday, The sustained mantra that everyone who is white is a redneck Christian racist is on Reddits front page every single day, I never see posts that denigrate black Christian people or Muslim Arabs, it’s very blatantly noticeable 
$C: They’re called reactionaries. Worthless scum.

$C: ...because people are getting beat up on reddit all the time these days. 
$C: yeah that's just stupid hyperbole.  
$C: The people who believe in raising children without gender, murdering babies in the womb, censoring free speech, taking away people’s means of defending themselves? Real family values.... 
$C: Bullshit. You’re anti-free speech. You have liberal values. Move to Canada if you don’t like free speech. 
$C: You're talking about institutional racism. This disingenuous conflating of institutional racism with racism as a whole needs to stop.

*Of course* there is racism against white people -- including in the US. Is it institutionalized here? No, of course it isn't. Does that mean that it isn't racism? No, of course it doesn't.

Saying there is "no *real* racism" against white people in the US as if the only *real* racism is institutional is fucking ridiculous.
$C: People discriminate based on color. It's entirely possible to be discriminated against if you're white. Being white doesn't get you invited into every ethnic clique that forms. No it's not institutionalized racism that others face but it can be just as pervasive.

The idea that white people can't be discriminated against is complete fiction.

This is where you confuse me. Which post are you referring to? 

If you are trying to say that my 'theory' is incorrect because people downvoted my post, you should know that makes little sense. 

I said the post was going to get crazy upvotes, it did. I was right. The fact that people downvoted me doesn't take anything away from that. It just says they think I am an asshole for being so blunt. I can live with that.

$C: I’m so jealous of all the new switch owners who are playing it for the first time 
$C: If you only plan on getting BOTW, no. I thought that that's all I'd end up with at the end of the year, but man was I wrong. Super Mario Odyssey is (IMO) better, Xenoblade 2 is awesome, Mario and Rabbids is fantastic and better than any others in the genre, and so much more. 
$C: I would say it's a very damn good first game to get. It'll take you some weeks to finish it (it's gonna take less time if you iron man grind it, naturally). 

Then there is now Skyrim, LA Noire (have no idea how good that one is though), Super Mario Odyssey and Mario Kart 8 HD. 

There's a fine assortment and there's more to come, including a rumoured Pokemon game (a full-blown RPG, not something like Pokkén Tournament). 
$C: I already had a Wii U, so there was no need for me to get a switch, since it's basically the same game. That being said, if you don't already have a Wii U, then yes, totally worth getting a switch for BOTW. Easily one of the best titles Nintendo has ever released.
$C: Risky click of the day
$C: Not too hard, not too soft

$C: Threads like this make me optimistic :) best of luck with everything OP, and to everyone going through what you went through or similarly tough situations. 
$C: These are wonderful insights :)

$C: [deleted]
$C: You sir are wise and kind. May life treat you well. 
$C: Yo, see these sweet solos you speak of... got any videos? Merry Christmas to you and your wonderful Grandma!
$C: Do you have videos of you playing slick solos?
$C: Merry Christmas man, thanks for spreading the love and being an all-around great guy. 
$C: You're a wonderful person. Merry Christmas to you and your grandma. 
$C: Merry Christmas!!
$C: You're making the entire internet fall in love with you! All your comments show what a lovely person you are + you're handsome AF (rockin' that bow tie!) + you love your grandma. I hope you're prepared for the consequences of being this charming. 
$C: you seem like a really cool dude. thanks for being out there, being you. 
$C: You mention you play guitar. Do you have some soundcloud or youtube channel or anything like that?
$C: Sorry guys I deleted my comment i didn't express myself correctly and I was getting likes (and even a gold : sorry kind stranger) for something that was misread(or better mistyped)

for any confusion: No I am not in any sort of risk, I have lived a very easy going life and am not looking for attention, it was honestly a comment that wasn't expressed well. I appreciate all the help comments and if anyone is at risk please seek advice and read OPs comment above.It is very informative.

I am so sorry for the confusion
$C: Man I’m totally for men showing emotion, but it’s just a harmless joke. I also never said **anything** about me being male

If you take someone joking about someone cutting onions as a deterrent of men showing emotions, that’s on you
$C: Well hey I got thousands of internet points, so I’ll take it

Also, a joke is “a thing that someone says to cause amusement or laughter, especially a story with a funny punchline,” so it kinda is

$C: Fuck that I got plenty of black friends and I grew up in the burbs with one. He had a nice family in a nice house, he just finally decided to be “hood” as you put it.  Idk why you think it’s a compliment. I guess this is sort of a question rather than a comment but why is that since you seem to know so much?
$C: Nah. Definitely not an excuse. In fact, you should know better. That compliment was horribly backhanded.
$C: a lay is someone you had sex with
$C: Potato chip

#THIS SHOULD BE A NORMAL THING AND IF ANYONE HAS A PROBLEM WITH INTERRACIAL BREEDING, YOU SHOULD MEET PEOPLE FROM THE GROUP YOU USED TO HATE. LOTS OF THEM. IF YOU MEET 1,000 WHITE PEOPLE AND ONE'S A DICK, IT'S A DROP IN THE BUCKET. IF YOU MEET 15 BLACK PEOPLE AND ONE'S A DICK, IT SEEMS MORE SIGNIFICANT. UP THE NUMBERS AND IT TENDS TO EVEN OUT.

#YOU ALSO GOTTA FACTOR IN HABITS. YOU PROGRAMMED YOURSELF TO HATE THEM FOR A GOOD, LONG TIME, AND IT'S GONNA KEEP GOING FOR A BIT, JUST BECAUSE OF MOMENTUM. YOUR JOB IS TO NOT ADD TO IT. NOTICE WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF THINKING IN YOUR OLD WAYS, BE NICE TO YOURSELF ABOUT IT, AND GENTLY REMIND YOURSELF HOW YOU'D LIKE TO BE INSTEAD. YOU'VE HEARD OF DEATH BY A THOUSAND CUTS? THIS IS HAPPINESS FROM A THOUSAND SMILES. ONE, TWO, OR TWENTY WON'T DO IT. MAKE IT A REGULAR THING AND LET THE NUMBERS GET BIG ENOUGH OVER TIME. 

#FIND SOME RANDOM, INANIMATE OBJECTS. THE MORE MUNDANE, THE BETTER. A PENCIL. A PLAIN COFFEE MUG. NOW, VICIOUSLY BERATE THE MUG. BE AS MEAN AND TOXIC AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN. DIG IN TO THAT THING FOR A SOLID TWO MINUTES, LIKE YOU'RE ACTIVELY TRYING TO BE SO AWFUL TO IT THAT IT COMMITS SUICIDE. YOU WILL FEEL LIKE SHIT. THAT'S ONE GOOD REASON NOT TO HATE--IT MAKES YOUR DAY WORSE. NOW GIVE THE MUG OVERFLOWING MESSAGES OF LOVE AND UNCONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE.

$C: Merry Christmas to those who live in a a place that hates gays and women like islamic law countries, they aren't worth our time!
$C: What does it mean to see someone as your equal? If you recognize differences in strength/general intelligence, you have to admit that some people are better at certain jobs than others - and that some jobs are more value than others.  It seems to me that you can only hold the belief in equality until you determine the capabilities of that person - what happens after you find out they are better/worse at certain things?

Should a person with 130 IQ necessarily see a person with 70 IQ as equal and in what way?  I just don't understand that definition of equality.
$C: I live in a large city in a western country and like all big cities in western countries non-whites flock to it, have seen people of all races here, have you smelled an east African? That is probably a big reason as to why I only see black people with their own. 
$C: Yeah, but Jesus, it's freaking Christmas.  I'm an atheist cynical piece of shit cunt, and I still think there's a moment for everything.
$C: >he doesn't care that it's true, he cares that people pretend it's not true 


This made me nod at my phone somberly.  Like Pompey Magnus said, "You touch it with a needle".  People mean well, but it's so transparent, pandering... insulting, it seems like.  Everyone dutifully lunging for the upvotes just because the guy is black with a white grandma?  That's _highlighting_ differences, it's the opposite of acceptance, and if the world was really post-racial, which is presumably the goal, then photos like this would have zero significance.  
$C: What do you mean by people and what do you mean by reddit?  Isn't reddit its users? Or are you talking about the reddit staff putting stuff up?
$C: > Long ago reddit was more or less honest

Bullshit. 
$C: If you answer my question, I can give an accurate assessment at yours.
$C: Because what you're saying and what OP implied are totally different things.
$C: Not seeing it is exactly why you have wrong information about it.
$C: I think you’re misunderstanding what was said. I can recognize my friend is Asian, has a different history, ethnicity, and experience while knowing they are still equal. Please reread what I said with that in mind. You don’t have to ignore ethnicity to view others as equal. I used to think in the same “colorblind” way until I went to school and was able to talk about things a lot with people of many different ethnicities. Equal can still be unique and ignoring someone’s ethnicity is ignoring part of their history, culture, and what makes them who they are. 
$C: Right. It is most definitely a very conservative forum. I stand corrected.
$C: You can definitely eat a dick. Going into old threads and getting upset because people get called out for their racism. Using an alt account is just the cherry on top of you're pathetic life
$C: Funny how you say I’m making assumptions when you’re doing the same thing to me. There’s literally entire subreddits dedicated to being racist on here. Blatant and subtly racist things get upvoted on this site all the time. Every other post with a black person on it gets locked. But every once in a while reddit will upvote to the top and gild a post with a black person in it just so they can later point to it and say “See?!? Reddit isn’t racist at all!”
$C: You should just see how antisemitic backyardchickens is!
$C: That’s .. What I said
$C: I see what you mean! Man sometimes the things people say on Reddit makes me wear my "screw racism" glasses lol... 
$C: Nah not at all. Just a dude that thinks a little differently I guess. 
$C: > The sustained mantra that everyone who is white is a redneck Christian racist is on Reddits front page every single day

there are a lot of news story, it has no impact on the racists because they just ignore the stories and just share what is good for their narrative

[here](https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/black-families-adopting-white-children/) is an website about adoption talking about black families that adopt white kids, the part about "Why Aren’t More Black Families Adopting White/Hispanic Kids?" may interest you, reasons include: 

> Depending on the agency, it may cost more to adopt a white baby.

> Proportionately, there are more African-American children in foster care in need of families.

> Not wanting the hassle/risk of being thought of as the nanny or kidnapper of the child.
$C: I shouldn't have to explain this but I will because it's Christmas. OP asked "who hurt you?". You replied "people who chime in with overused phrases". 

That's mostly what reddit replies are, so I was saying if those overused phrases hurt you, you're in for a world of hurt.

 
$C: I spend a lot of time on reddit I guess. 

This nonsense is everywhere and yea, downvotes tend to bury this bullshit anyways, but seriously it's annoying that people even come to such delusional thinking. It's easy enough to read through enough comments and see the same trend of thoughts - like the diversity = upvotes angle lord_of_the_ham tried to make. 

"So, you want to silence or have people silenced that disagree with you!"

No, I want this part of the USA to die out already. Racism, sexism, political divides in EVERY FUCKING THING EVER by a lot of people. 

So, yea, quote me, triggered. 
$C: Yes because all liberals clearly want that. You're so very in touch with liberals, I can tell. We all just raise genderless children, of course. And censor everything. You caught us.

Conservatives are much more likely to want to ban fiction with explicit or controversial material. That's been the case for decades and decades. 

The "murdering babies" thing is absurd, and clearly we won't see eye to eye with that. If you actually took the time to look at data instead of how you feel, you'd know that most support restrictions past the first trimester, and especially in the third trimester except for health emergencies. A first trimester birth isn't a baby, for crying out loud. But of course, we won't agree.

And I'm pro second amendment rights just like many other liberals. You clearly have fallen for a narrative, as is normally the case. Concern over assault-style weapons and issues like that doesn't mean "they're takin our guns away boys!". Same shit, every time.
$C: You probably can't describe what free-speech means legally... 
$C: I mean it says a lot when the comment section on a wholesome post that happens to feature a black person somehow devolves to "there's racism against white people too!". Nothing like that would ever happen on a post featuring all white people.
$C: The institutional sort is more harmful though. It affects an entire group of people. Isolated incidents only suck for the victim.
$C: Discrimination doesn't always equal racism. ... Discrimination DOES happen when men aren't allowed into a women's support group, for example.

See, English is complicated like that. Discrimination doesn't have to be racism but it exists in forms; white people being discriminated against for not joining certain groups is so not racism... 

When we as a culture say blacks have been historically discriminated it's a different definition of the same word. 
$C: While I understand the point he is making and the nuance involved, this comment is funny as fuck. Merry Upvote!
$C: People can be, there is not an actual racist ideology against white people in the USA. You skipped over the rest of my post to cherry-pick things. 
$C: Tell it to, then: u/Lord_of_the_

They brought up this shit and I'm getting real tired of these comments across reddit - not even just racism but EVERYTHING. So fucking annoying. 

It's a happy thread about an adopted guy and the grandma who took him in; /u/lord_of_the_ made it all political and racist with his comment. I'm just speaking up to say, "Hey, not fucking cool, yo."

$C: Your assumption that people downvote your opinions because you're just blunt is unrealistically self-protective, and exists as an assumption to emotionally protect yourself from having to evolve beyond your current mindset.

$C: Thanks 
$C: >What does it mean to see someone as your equal?

You are my equal in the sense that you deserve all of the same basic benefits and rights of living in society, and respect, that I enjoy. Or more specifically, you deserve the same rights I enjoy, and a minimum level of benefits that all people should have. 

For example, I believe everyone has a right to free healthcare, regardless of their level of contribution to society or criminal behavior. In this way, you are equal to me in that I recognize your right to live and be healthy. (Accordingly, I don't believe in the death penalty.)

There may be a  few exceptions that some of those things might be taken away if they take negative actions demonstrating they cannot be trusted with those benefits. An example is felons losing the right to vote. I don't know if I agree with that sanction, but it's an example of what I'm talking about. 

>It seems to me that you can only hold the belief in equality until you determine the capabilities of that person 

I can believe you have a basic human right to certain things simply because you are human, independent of your intelligence, ethnicity, cultural background, beliefs, behavior, etc.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Its mostly just annoying having to see all these posts get so many upvotes just because theres black people in them. Like I get it we shouldn't be racist now stop pushing this shit down my throat. Theres nothing that special or interesting about people taking other people in. It happens everyday and I bet there are dozens or hundreds posts like this. Why aren't they on the front page too?  The post getting 100k+ is because he's black. 

It happens everywhere not just on reddit. Most recent movies, some video games do it too for "muh diversity" when they shouldn't really. Just sjws and their shit
$C: How so? He just said it wouldn’t get 60k... I agree, doesn’t make it less wholesome or worthy. 
$C: On a day-to-day basis, I do not see their ethnicity. If, for example, my friend of X ethnicity likes certain music or food or has a perspective shaped by his cultural experience, then those are simply the qualities I see in that person. It would be a *huge* mistake for me to assume anything about my friend because of his ethnicity, and so I make no assumptions. If I 'see' his ethnicity, then I am making assumption about him based on his classification in a group, rather than him as an individual.

The only scenario in which ethnicity has a place is when communicating with an entire ethnic group, say in healthcare or education where a large number of people in the group I serve identify as a certain ethnicity. Without knowing them as individuals, I might make certain precautionary assumptions so I don't offend them, until I understand them as individuals. For example, I might avoid using certain artwork in a facility or on my office wall if the imagery is offensive in a religious context (the stereotypical example is, say, a nature photo of an owl in a hospital serving Native Americans who view owls as symbolic of death).
$C: Happy holidays!
$C: Link three posts which got locked BECAUSE people were being racist against a black person
$C: He said two things and you didn't specify which you were responding too. Sorry I thought you meant seeing race was prejudiced.

$C: hahaha. I get it now. Merry Christmas my dude
$C: I think that person made a totally reasonable point.  Reddit has a huge left-leaning bias so things promoting racial diversity will be upvoted to the top.  I'm pretty centrist so it does irritate me a little bit to see that.  I'd rather have a balanced perspective and not the leftist hive mind Reddit has turned into.  It is also totally possible for people to have racist attitudes towards white people.   
$C: I'm not sure what point you're making here. I don't think anyone's saying that white people don't have it *much* better off when it comes to race relations.

Besides, person who brought up the "racism against white people" issue was actually the person suggesting that racism against white people isn't "real" racism.
$C: Like motherfucking clockwork, it always happens.
$C: Tell that to the black on white violent crime rate. 5x higher than white on black. Per capita, it becomes around 20x higher. I'd rather deal with stop and frisk than some gang banger trying to play the knockout game when I walk by.
$C: It's crazy to me that you felt the need to point this out, as if there isn't an obvious middle ground between "there's no real racism against white people" and "institutionalized racism does more damage than personal racism."
$C: Yeah, English is complicated! For example, you can end up with a bunch of assholes trying to pigeonhole the meaning of racism to be limited to institutionalized racism.
$C: you think every white person is invited into the 1% club? poor white people face the same sort of institutional discrimination poor black people do. as a person of slavic descent i'd like to hear you tell me my ancestors didn't face that sort of shit.
$C: Pointing out that people are more likely upvote a picture of a biracial grandma/grandson is hardly racist or political. 

I know you think you are being noble, but really you are just overreacting.

It's hilarious to me that you can't see the hypocrisy in this comment. You dug through his comments like a creeper and care way too much about a harmless joke. Yeah, socializing properly is definitely your master craft.

$C: It does indeed, but I don't think the "what" was because the previous poster was hard of hearing or short sighted, or whatever. Perhaps "What the fudgesicles" would have conveyed his meaning a little better.
$C: I didn't downvote you, for the record.


But you haven't still answered my question.  Who is "they"?
$C: [deleted]

I said that, too, that people can be racist but there is not some mass racist against white movement in the USA.

Heavily agreed. I'm tired of both/all/any extremes. It's all so nonsensical.

>I think that person made a totally reasonable point.

You look through that person's history and it becomes even more evident what they meant here; that comment was, IMO, not talking about a tendency for Reddit to upvote liberal-centric viewpoints and media.

I know that's a total dick-move to read through someone's history but after my response ruffled this many feathers I just had to. 
$C: Yeah, stop and frisk is the full extent of institutionalised racism.
$C: Just wanted to make sure you knew.
$C: That's poor people. 

I grew up in trailers, small apartments, section-8 housing, spent weeks sleeping in sleeping-bags in the back of a truck homeless growing up, food banks and government insurance, ketchup sandwiches, shoes two sizes too small and fighting constantly, had to go through CPS moving me around - living with relatives for extended periods, food-stamps - I know what it's like to be poor. 

Being poor is shit and everyone shits on you. Hell, being poor is its own category of institutional discrimination and prejudice that impacts those people in it heavily negatively. 

I wouldn't go so far to say that being white and poor means you're still likely to have more benefits from society overall as a white person than a non-white, non-native person. 

Again, this is USA-centric in conversation .... 


$C: Your ancestors didn't face that sort of shit. There you go.
$C: Honestly, I did browse your history after my first response; it only solidified my assessment. 

You're kind of a dick. A schmuck if you will. 
$C: No, I said it to you.
$C: couldn't leave the "found the angry black" comment eh?
$C: Hot take: you were downvoted because you're wrong.

And your post was deleted because it was wrong.

$C: Thanks for proving me right. Have a nice holiday. Feel free to have the last word. 
$C: Man, reddit users really hate it when toxic masculinity they are so used to reaping karma from is pointed out.

For a group that professes to care about disadvantages men have, they don’t like to be shown the ones they willingly participate in, even in mild ways.

$C: I guess you're right then. Except for that last one. Didn't find any racist comments. Which is probably true for r/aww and r/eyebleach where people tend to be nice.
$C: You don't know who downvotes your comments. You're fighting a racist bogeyman.
$C: I didn't downvote you, but OK...
$C: nope, they did help me buy a house though. Now I live entirely on the money I make from renting out 3 of the spare bedrooms. you jelly, bro?  
$C: going through someone's post history for that 'gotcha' moment is a meaningless exercise in confirmation bias.  read the comment in the context it was intended.  
$C: Well you're certainly not referring to entrance into higher education or assistance programs. The examples always brought up are issues relating to cops, and I dunno if you've noticed but that has a whole lot to do with all the crime. You can absolutely make a case for police bias, but to shove all the blame on the cops is dishonest.
$C: Of course I do, and it's strange to me that you could've inferred otherwise from my comment.
$C: When you have to reach back in time for victim points, you might need to find a better argument

I hope you can find inner peace and work on decreasing your projection. I’m sure you’ll overcome being a dick someday.

Sure, I guess I’ll take the “last word.” Thanks.
$C: Yeah, this comment still doesn't make you less of a hypocrite. It was a good effort though, I guess?

Also painting the entire multimillion user base of reddit with broad strokes like that is one way to make your argument lose all validity. 
$C: My joke didn’t even mention the male gender

$C: I hear you, friend.  Still, your struggle with seeing this message is a small price to pay for helping those who are still suffering the consequences of those who came before us.  What's worse? That you have to endure a message of "say no to racism," every once in a while, or that you have to endure actual racism? And by enduring actual racism, I'm not saying someone calling you "nigger!" every other week, but being denied work/money/shelter/a fair trial/a safety net _permanently_.



I'm straight.  I've noticed that gay couples are more prevalent in the media (TV shows, especially.)  I notice it's more prevalent than it should be, but so what?  It doesn't really affect me.  I'm not afraid of [being tied to a post, beat up and left for dead because of my sexual orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Shepard).

$C: Five minutes waiting to use the bathroom, sure. 
$C: "It is though. Even if you buy the "racism = power" shit, you're aware white people aren't the dominant race in all parts of the world right?"

This is what I was replying to. This thread isn't the time or place because it has no bearing to ops picture or story. Even if you didn't start this sub thread. It's not an argument just a statement that's all. Downvote the original op Lord_of_th so it's burried unless a mod deletes it. Have a great holiday :) 
$C: That's not how you proposed the reason for the post's popularity. You proposed it was only popular because you recognized some racial angle. The downvotes argued otherwise.

Look, I'm no your father, I can't convince you into introspection. You do you, think what you think but it's a hard bet to assume 120 are just embarrassed and your right. That's a clear emotional deflection.

$C: Don't worry about people like him, dude. He's the kind of person who argues for the sake of arguing even when he can't see his own hypocrisy in calling out someone for not "socializing normally" when he dug through your comments like a creep. So don't let people like him get to you, just shrug them off like the man-children they are.
$C: Mmmm unrelated. 

I went into that commenter’s history because he claimed gender had nothing to do with his joke. Patiently false and easy to see. But yes, rather than discuss toxic masculinity, let’s just dogpile the people who bring it up and change the subject. 
$C: Didn’t have to. You can’t figure everyone is dense enough to buy that reasoning.

only a small amount are racist today racism was only a problem 100 years ago maybe

try reading what I said before i wont repeat myself im tired

if it wasnt about racism messages it wouldnt get so many upvotes

its a nice story i agree but not 100k upvotes worth 
$C: Why are all the people calling it an overreaction so heavily downvoted?
$C: All the controversial comments are saying that the black guy didn't deserve such an overreaction tho.
$C: kk
$C: That's because the premise behind your comment was an idiotic, disingenuous argument that's been getting pushed way too much lately. 

This is why you were arguing with an obvious asshole and managed to get downvoted to hell for it in a default sub. That's impressive.
$C: Preferential treatment is a bad example to cite if you want to claim discrimination by institutions, friendo. 
$C: dude, would a picture of a white dude and his white grandma have gotten 147K upvotes...come on. 

You seem to view me saying that diversity = upvotes on reddit the same as me calling him the n-word (something I would never do) so do the 120 people who downvoted me. But the 147K people who upvoted this post suggest that I was indeed correct.

$C: Thanks man. For some reason, things irk me way more than they should

Happy holidays!
$C: Yet again, digging through someone's comment history is not what someone who is "socializing normally" does. You're a hypocrite. Simple as that, really.
$C: Well, gender did have nothing to do with it, and you’re totally unqualified to say otherwise
$C: It’s not reasoning; it’s a fact. My joke did not mention the male gender. It was simply a joke about hiding **my** emotions by saying someone is chopping onions, not because I’m a man. I’m one of the most effeminate men I know

How far does claiming other people’s views are different to what they truly are get you in life?
$C: Realistically, if I could make every plural Latin, I think I would. 

Besides, when am I ever going to have to talk about multiple platypi?
$C: You can't just say "only" when it's the majority.


I understand what you're saying, but 40K out of 200K isn't "most redditors."
$C: Lol so I'm now the famous boogeyman, the strawman called "es-jay-doupleyoos". I didn't know that. Not being a racist automatically makes me an es-jay-doupleyoo. Hahaha what a joke. Btw, just sort out by the top most popular because this post has as much worth as the others.
$C: I guess some people on reddit thinks it’s okay to beat someone half to death because they pushed a cardboard box? 
$C: Yeah, ask yourself why those comments are sorted under controversial.
$C: There are no more default subs. That changed months ago.
$C: Yeah, those quotas are so generous.
$C: >would a picture of a white dude and his white grandma have gotten 147K upvotes

Yes.
$C: [Well don't stop now](https://i.imgur.com/0hQyd5L.gif)
$C: You know the only people I know who say this is people whose comment history refutes their point. 

But sure. Why not. I don’t super care what you think of me. I do care about pointless toxic masculinity under the guise of “joking,” since as men, it’s putting ourselves in a worse situation. 
$C: K lol
$C: You’re ridiculous. 

Why would anyone write “is anyone chopping onions?! -BY THE WAY IM A DUDE IN CASE THAT WASNT CLEAR SO I NEED AN EXCUSE TO COME UP WITH WHY IM CRYING.”

Spin it all you want. The concept is toxic masculinity and no willful obtuse-ness will change that. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: >Racism is one of the of 4 biggest problem in our world.

saying this makes u an sjw

just delusional
$C: Oh, I'd forgotten about that. Sorry; former default sub with 18 million subs.
$C: Better than a prison quota, which would be even more fair.
$C: lol, try it. 
$C: > You know the only people I know who say this is people whose comment history refutes their point. 

Implying that you do this often, how else would you know that their comment history refutes their points? 

Also, your hypocrisy has nothing to do with what I think about you. I think nothing about you because you're nothing to me as I don't know you. I'm merely pointing out an irrefutable fact. You are a hypocrite. 
$C: But I didn’t say by the way I’m a dude, so surely that means you’re the ridiculous one??

I mentioned that when you stalked me to find my demographics

> Well after a bit of looking at your comments you’re:

>* a dude or lesbian/bi

>* a teenager

That argument is inherently flawed, which means the rest of your point of me saying what I said in the name of toxic masculinity is too
$C: I can agree with you on that. But again, that's not "most redditors." Many, yes. Most, no.


"Most black people support the antivax movement."

"Dude, not most. Just three thousand out of 40 million."

"Well, it's still a lot."
$C: Okay :)
$C: Nope. That’s not how that works. The fact that you’re a dude and saying something that reinforces toxic masculinity is germane. 
$C: I agree. Still reddit is full of racist neckbeards. It didn't use to be like this. 
$C: I'm glad we had this conversation because it needed to be pointed out. Showing someone their flaws is the only way they'll correct them. This will be my last reply, enjoy the rest of your crusade. :) 
$C: So I can’t joke about not crying because I’m male? Would it be okay for a female to make that joke? What you’re implying is the only discrimination here
$C: Mmhmm. Like I said, don’t super care. 

Overarching point remains the same. Stupid joke that needs to go away as it contributes in a minor way to a toxic concept. 

Misdirect all you’d like from that, but it remains *my* point. 
$C: That’s faulty logic and I do hope you realize it. It’s not discriminatory for a joke, even a tired old one, to be different as a male than a woman. 

You can do whatever the heck you want. Just know that the *concept* of having to come up with excuses why you’re crying rather than just own your feelings is one that predates you by hundreds of years, and is damaging to men in general. Albeit minorly. 
$C: Dude, it’s not faulty logic. I’m allowed to joke about **me** not crying without it being about all men. That’s **your** inference, not **my** implication.

Stop projecting and being discriminatory. If you think my joke isn’t okay because I’m a male, you’re being discriminatory.

If a man chooses to make my joke about his masculinity, that’s on him.

I’m pretty flamboyant and effeminate, and I’m not bothered about masculinity at all. Sometimes we need a good cry.

Stop being stupid
$C: You are literally making the same joke that’s always made here. If I were to make a Reddit doll with a pull string in it this would be one of the lines. 

It’s tired. It’s old. It’s unoriginal. It perpetuates stupid ideas. 
$C: You’re interpreting stupid ideas (regarding toxic masculinity. I agree that it’s a low effort, easy karma grab). 

That doesn’t mean that **my** statement of the joke is a testament to toxic masculinity

Stop projecting. My female friends make cutting onion jokes all the time 
$C: Unrelated to the main issue, but while we're on the topic of tired, old and unoriginal jokes...

Would you mind retiring "DAE" in favour of something more witty to berate circlejerks? Thanks.
$C: I just don’t get why it’s hard to accept that maybe, *maybe* you’ve internalized some of this stuff. Heck I’m guilty of it too, and  a spooky SJW. Ah well we aren’t going to meet anywhere on this. I hope your Christmas was good. 
$C: Man you are deeeep. What are you even doing down here?
$C: Because it’s not true

I’m happy to cry, but I’m also happy to joke about **me** not crying

You’re pathetic 
$C: I don't even know

I think I missed a dose
$C: And you’re still being a dick to anyone who disagrees with you. 
$C: It doesn’t get any saner as you follow the chain down. 
$C: Sorry, you’re the one saying what other people’s views are (incorrectly) and saying I can’t make a joke about **myself** because other males might interpret it as an attack on them, as well as saying that I have poor social skills for no reason, stalking my comment history, profiling me, and coming at me for saying I’m a guy when I literally said “I am indeed a dude” **after** said stalking, but I’m the dick? Okay, invalid
$C: I had a whole thing typed out, but then I realized I was trying to get a teenager to have some introspection on social issues, and realized at this point, I wasn't going to get anywhere.  So again, have a nice evening and enjoy the rest of your school break.
$C: >I’m telling you the message it *sends*

You literally said, “the concept is toxic masculinity.” You cant correctly dictate the concept of my joke

>Show me where I said you can’t

Okay. I mean you said it’s wrong to

>your history shows me

I’m only a dick when it’s warranted

>you continue to be a dick

Where?

>I’m not sure

You should be, considering you’re the only dick in this convo

>isa thing dicks say

Yeah, probably. But it’s also a thing people who are dicks to people who deserve it say

>have the introspection to change

There’s nothing I should be changing. Even other people agree you’re just the dick here

>I thought I knew everything ... too

I don’t. But I do know that my joke was about me and not all men, and that interpretation is on you. 

Stop being so stupid and wrong

It’s also funny that you keep saying have a nice ... and then coming back. It really shows that you’re the only immature one. Are you just too tempted to continue being stupid at a teenager?

It’s funny thst an adult is criticizing a teenager and then literally being the only dick. Stop being such a pussy and realize that someone joking about not crying isn’t an attack on your fragile masculinity
$C: :). 

I like debating on the Internet. But I don’t think I’m going to get anywhere with you. But I keep getting pulled in. It’s a character flaw. 

My masculinity is fine. I’m assuming yours is too. I’m just saying you should think before perpetuating toxic concepts. 
$C: You’re not getting anywhere because you’re just wrong

I’m not perpetuating toxic concepts, because my joke had **nothing to do with my state of being male or my masculinity. I am a very effeminate person and cry regularly recently. It is okay for males to cry, just as it is okay for me to make jokes about me not crying.**

You should think before taking a joke about someone else as an attack on your evidently fragile masculinity
