The conversation my son and I will have on Christmas Eve.

$C: Welp. I guess we’ll be seeing this reposted every December for the rest of our lives. 
$C: I was on the fence with believing in Santa, but now I'm back on board after watching this. 


$C: This is top tier. Top. Tier.
$C: Was expecting it to end with "YOU'RE GOD DAMNED RIGHT I ATE THE COOKIES"
$C: That was fucking intense!

Edit: Did I spell "intense" wrong? Everyone keeps making dad jokes that don't make sense in writing. Are any of you even dads?

Edit 2: You cunts are doing it on purpose now!
$C: That would receive my vote as GIF of the year
$C: Is it strange I can hear this gif? 
$C: We had to break the Santa Claus myth for our son early because at age 5 on Christmas Eve he started freaking out about a strange man breaking into our house, regardless of motive.  He was inconsolable and would not accept that this was safe no matter what we said.  So, we finally had to tell him that Santa wasn't coming and that we would put his presents under the tree.  He immediately stopped crying and was fine after that.
$C: HUGE Thank you to /u/folkingawesome who generously turned my 3:07 video into this long-ass GIF.
$C: I am disturbed by the image of Tom Cruise calling Jack Nicholson “Daddy”. 

Edit: I should add that I am not judging those who are either indifferent or enjoy that image. I just have difficulty with these two specific people in that scenario, but we all have different tastes.
$C: Wow, that was awesome. My new favorite high quality gif, really well made.

*The script lines up awesome with the mouth movements and I can hear the actors' voices in my head because it looks so natural. Disturbing seeing Tom Cruise call Jack Nicholson 'daddy' o_o.
$C: I could watch this forever!  "I can confirm with Mommy..."  This is a treasure.
$C: Hello, I have no culture whatsoever, what movie is this gif made from ?
$C: Santa ordered the Code Red
$C: "Because, son, Santa *sees* everything and *hears* everything but he needs the letter because he doesn't *remember* everything. 

You see, Santa likes egg nog, every day. And egg nog has rum. And rum makes you forget shit. Like when Aunt Julie lost her pants on New Year's eve last year? 

So we write him letters"
$C: This is art.
$C: My daughter is 7 years old but still a ‘young’ 7 and so we thought we could keep the belief in Santa for at least one more year. 

But four days ago she came up to me with a notebook in hand and asked to hold a family meeting. So husband, baby brother, the dog and I gathered together in the living room where she announced, with a tone that was most serious, that she’s come to the conclusion that Squint (elf on the shelf), is not real and therefore she doesn’t think Santa is real, either.  She then proceeded to show us her notebook which contained notes of various experiments she had secretly conducted upon Squint.

The first experiment was to touch and move the elf, which kids are not supposed to do according to the book because it takes away the elf’s magic. She noted that Squint still moved that night.

She cuffed Squint’s hands and feet with pipe cleaners but noted he still moved that night. She told him to move to specific areas under the bribe that if he does, he will find treats. But he didn’t consistently move to those spots and has yet to find the treats, etc. 

The night before the family meeting, the last experiment she did was to put scissors over Squint’s legs and close them ever so slightly to see how Squint would respond, stopping just short of actually cutting Squint’s legs. She said that any living thing would not have trusted her to stop and would have moved away or fought back and therefore, he’s not real.

Admittedly I was a bit disturbed, but we had a big talk away from her little brother and asked her to please not spoil the magic for him, which she promised not to do.
$C: Fucking hell this is amazing. As someone who got all my Karma from a meme I made from this very scene, I support this. It got deleted after about an hour, but it took off. This scene is comedic gold and you capitalized hard. Well done, OP
$C: jesus chirst, this is like watching an entire movie... a plot, a conflict, a resolution, it had everything it was just... the perfect gif...
$C: That's it. Shut it down. No need to post anything else on reddit for the rest of the year. This wins all of 2017. Bravo sir, bravo.
$C: So fun story with my kid's mom.  She came to me last month noting, "I think he is beginning to catch on that Santa is not real."  She talks about how they are walking in Wal-Mart, and he makes some comment about hoping Santa gets him this Hot Wheels garage set thing.  It's like a $130 toy or whatever, and whatever comment she made had him say, "You just don't want to get it for me since you're probably Santa."  So, she freaks out because she has little ones, and she wants to keep the Santa dream alive for them, and then, the saving grace on why Santa "must be real" turns into him saying, "But then again, I got this laptop and a 3DS the last two years at dad's house, and he's too poor to afford it, so maybe he is real after all."

Thank you negative bank account for being good for something. :/

spez: Shit, I absolutely totally just remember what his actual excuse was for thinking Santa was not real.  "How is one guy going to go to all those houses and deliver presents to kids in *one* night?"  I had one job... and I botched it. :'(
$C: Speechless. So powerful. 
$C: You and your son have some heated discussions.
$C: This is one of the best things I've ever seen on reddit.
$C: Original : https://youtu.be/_frM44bBMfA
$C: I have never spent such a long time on one single gif.....
$C: LEGO is the plural of LEGO. 
$C: bravo..."you're goddam right he is!"
$C: This needs more gold
$C: This is pretty amazing, thanks for the laugh!
$C: I'm...I'm not ready for this conversation. I may need to save this and memorize it for later.
$C: Fuck this gets pretty real towards the end.
$C: Top shelf, OP. 
$C: Absolutely perfect!!!
$C: This was beautifully subtitled. 
$C: Can we get a spoiler tag. 
$C: Thank you for leaving, "YOU CANT HANDLE THE TRUTH!" intact.
$C: That was intense
$C: After reading this, I feel like my life goes into a turmoil not because I didn't know if santa is real; it is whether if, one day, I should relive santa in my children live or not, because if I have to, I'm facing a possibility of getting into a conversation like this. 
$C: As a father of three is the single greatest Christmas gif 
$C: That was amazing!

$C: I've never once been moved by a gif before. God almighty this was dope.
$C: I saw this neat idea that a woman did. When her kids found out santa wasnt real, she told that they were now old enough to become "Santa". She made them pick someone in need of a gift and find out what they needed. The kids delivered the present and signed it "Santa". They felt good about themselves seeing the neighbour down the street wearing the slippers they got her. 

The one catch was that they had to keep it a secret. If they told anyone about their "santa privileges", then they couldn't be Santa anymore. 

I thought this was a cool idea when the kids find out Santa isn't real, but the parents want to keep the Magic of Christmas alive. 
$C: The conversation I had last year with my (then) 7 year old son went a little something like this.

>"Dad, I know that you and Mom are Santa"

Oh? You think we're Santa?

> "Yes I know you put presents under the tree"

Have you seen this happen?

>No I haven't

Do your friends tell you that it's all of your parents?

>Yes

Well then I have a question for you. Let's say your friends ARE right, and every boy and girl across the world thinks, for awhile, that Santa Clause is real. And every Christmas morning, they get presents underneath the Christmas tree. Well, let's say that some kids think that their parents are Santa, but their little brother and little sister still think Santa is real. Do you think it would be smart to tell them?

>Yes they should know

Hmm. And if Mom and Dad ARE Santa, do you think that we would be happy that you told your brother and sister that Santa isn't real?

>... well...

Well, let's say that even if a kid, like you, maybe, thinks that Santa ISNT real, but doesn't tell anybody else... well... do you think that presents STILL go underneath the Christmas tree for that little boy?

>... yeeeeeessss?

Well, then what does it matter if Santa is real, or Santa isn't real? The presents come no matter what, right?

>Yes

So... maybe, just maybe, do you think that it would be smart to let your little brother and sister keep thinking that there's a magical kind man that brings presents down the chimney? 

>Yes, I think so

And maybe, just maybe, you'll be able to keep getting presents EVEN IF YOU THINK you know that Santa isn't real?

>Okay I won't tell them Santa isn't real

Wait a second here, did I say Santa isn't real?

>No

Well... what if your brother and sister ask if he's real or not... will you tell them that he is or isn't?

>I'll tell them that Santa is just as real as the fact that in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table

$C: “Santa’s a busy man...”

Epic setup OP. **Epic** setup.
$C: I think I’m gonna watch this finally today. 
$C: Shoulda warned me. I woulda gotten a bucket of popcorn first.
$C: 19 gold. How awesome! I would be over the moon if I could ever get just one, let alone nine-freaking-teen. 

Edit: YOU’RE THE BEST!
$C: Ended up re-watching this whole movie tonight because of this post. 
$C: GIF the movie
$C: How long does it take to make something like this?
$C: GIF of the year hands down. Amazing. 👍
$C: [deleted]
$C: After I got berated on a comment I made, I'd figure I'd share my newfound knowledge: the plural of Lego is Lego. 
$C: You're a lousy fucking softball player Rudolph! 
$C: You want me on that roof!  You need me on that roof!  Going down chimneys, delivering presents!  
$C: For those who haven't seen [the actual scene]
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83MQhjfYW0o) you should watch it. Makes this gif so much more impressive because of the way the text was built around the framework of the actual script
$C: I don't think I've ever seen 70k upvotes in three hours. This GIF is bigger than Obama's AMA.
$C: 16 golds. Wow. This guy with one post got 16 golds. I post constantly and can't get one. Boy I suck
$C: This is the most rewarding gif I've ever seen..... 

Great work /u/romobyl and /u/folkingawesome!


$C: He sees what you're doing, not what you're thinking.
$C: I just tell my son to get his butt to bed or I’ll replace Santa’s toys with my farts.

My son doesn’t like my farts.
$C: Wow! This was epic!! 
$C: This is incredible. Thank you
$C: Simply the best I’ve seen, of all time.
$C: My God.   Well done, sir.  *-Slow Clap, Rising From Toilet Seat-* Well done.
$C: This is literally gold.
$C: This is fantastic. Maybe the best thing I've ever seen on Reddit. I just want to thank you for posting this, have a good Christmas.
$C: Can the creator of this gif write and direct the next Star Wars please?
$C: I don't comment often...but bra-FUCKIN-vo!

LITERALLY laughed out loud
$C: Holy shit. I have to say. Today was the 5th worst day of my life. There was crying and almost being walked out of a hospital in handcuffs.

But here it is 9:30 at night, I finally found a modicum of peace to sit down and browse reddit to try to calm down from the day.

And 2 minutes in I was actually fucking laughing. If you made this, thank you for making it. If you're posting it, thank you for posting it (even if it's a repost). You got me laughing after the fucking shit-show of a day.
$C: Wow awesome video/animation!  In Mr. Nicholson's defense, just because Santa sees you and knows what you're doing doesn't mean he knows what you want in your heart ;-) 
$C: Damn that was an intense emotional experience.
$C: I realized Santa wasn't real once I could recognize my mother's handwriting on the to and from tags. The funniest story and cutest I have is of my daughter, who is now 17. When she was about 9 I told her the same thing I always told her when she said she wanted something for Christmas. I would tell her Santa goes to Daddy's house. And I told her this particular year that probably I wouldn't have anything at my house for Christmas. It was a rough year. My sweet angel daughter said to me, "It's okay Mommy, I know Santa isn't real". I told her not to tell her dad that she knew so she could keep the dream alive for him because he loved doing Christmas for her.
$C: Holy shit 20 gold?
$C: Lego.
Great GIF though ;)
$C: What is the name of this movie?
$C: We've peaked guys. We can stop now.
$C: "It is the official request from Santa and team. Idk, I think they use them for historical documentation...." 
$C: Beautiful 
$C: I came here to laugh, not feel things dammit.
$C: Sex is like Bridge. If you don't have a good partner then you're going to need a strong hand.
$C: The most intense wholesome gif I've ever seen.
$C: Masterpiece.  And I'm using that word correctly, not like, literally.
$C: This is fantastic, I cried laughing a little (I'm at work, squanched it). Very well done. I so wish we could get those two to act this scene out.
$C: Dude, spoiler tag please!? You just ruined my Christmas 
$C: Because its polite, he wants you to know you're thinking of  him and to write him... like your grandparents!


$C: Best gifmas present ever 
$C: Wow. Just wow. 
$C: As a mom, this got me right in the feels.
$C: r/noisygifs
$C: I did not find this funny.
$C: When I was first saw this , there were about 2 dozen comments and less than a thousand upvotes and no gold.. few hours later here we are at over 100k upvotes and 14 gold. 
$C: Hi guys browsing top of all time in the future.

$C: Could we somehow crowdfund this scene so that Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson could give us an actual working clip?  This is now first on my bucketlist.  The second is watch Casablanca, Singing in the rain, and Godfather but with all the voice actors of Spongebob Squarepants.
$C: Holy shit this is the post with the most gold I've ever seen
$C: Jesus.  Now I just want to watch this movie.

With these words. 

Tom Cruise should be in footy pajamas too. 
$C: Holy cow, 20 gold I’ve never seen that much before
$C: Appropriate actors given Tom Cruise is the height of your average 10-year-old.
$C: This needs audio!!
$C: Quite possibly the best gif ever made
$C: this is amazing

$C: That was incredible. I have nothing else to say.
$C: Tom Cruise calling Jack Nicholson "daddy" is making me uncomfortable...
$C: Brilliant, just brilliant!
$C: Would love a voice actor/imitator to dub over this gif
$C: This is the single greatest thing ever posted in reddit. 
$C: This is the best thing I’ve ever seen. 
$C: Awesome gif! But shit, I'd be lying if I didn't say that it was mildly depressing.
$C: HOLY SHIT this is the best gif I have EVER seen
$C: This is a goddamned masterpiece.
$C: That was fucking awesome!!!!!
$C: This is the best gif I've ever seen
$C: Me: "Get everything in writing in order for it to be legal and sound."

$C: I was so scared I was going to miss a word and have to re-watch the entire thing
$C: Who ordered the Code Red... and Green?
$C: I watched the entire thing.
$C: Can someone please post the actual video of this scene? It's depressing that I've never seen it
$C: I heard Jack Nicholson saying this in my head. Excellent.
$C: That was glorious, thank you. 
$C: This is the best thing ive ever seen. Thank you for this. If I didnt have christmas presents to buy for my children I could afford to give you gold, unfortunately Paw Patrol and Peppa Pig will get all of my money this Christmas.
$C: Very rarely do I find something from Reddit that holds my wife's attention or even generates a laugh, but alas, this did it. Thank you for that. I finally feel like all my wasted attempts have not been in vain. This video got a "how much longer is this" and, even, "oh this is getting good"
$C: I think the bit about constipation really sold this.
$C: I remember when I pressed my mom for the truth. And she finally caved, tearfully revealing; santa claus, the tooth fairy, the easter bunny all her and my dad, this whole time. The candy, the baskets, the money, the toys... All coming from inside the house. So then, I asked... And god? To which she quickly replied "Oh no baby, he's real." 
$C: What is this movie guys ?
$C: Hilarious!
$C: I’m jealous of your upvotes and 24 gold. 
$C: "...put in headphones and ignore the sounds coming from the living room"

lost it here
$C: “Why isn’t he asleep yet?” LOL
$C: Thats the most gold I've ever seen.
$C: The most upvoted posts of the year list might have to change
$C: I can already see it. This is gonna be one of the best of all time.
$C: That had to be the longest gif I have ever seen... And the best! Bravo from one dad to another. 
$C: Was expecting this to end at the "you can handle the truth" line. But really it's much better that it doesn't.
$C: This is hilarious, and brilliant.

But HOLY SHIT look at that gold! (23 as of this post)
$C: omg 200k upvotes and 22 gold 
$C: Happy cake day!
$C: 3 months later and I'm seeing this for the first time. Fan. Fucking. Tastic. 
$C: What movie is this? Seriously don't know
$C: Ah shit is this one of those cringey ass long gifs again... 
$C: It's a surreal moment the first time a child sees through you on an issue like this.
$C: Jesus this gif was long
$C: Jesus fucking god that is a long ass gif. 
$C: I feel like you and your son have some unresolved issues. Beautiful post! 
$C: This was fantastic.
$C: Wow. Guess I'll get this started... 
:: slow clap :: 
$C: This is the best gif ever.
$C: This is the single greatest Christmas GIF I've ever seen. Thank you.
$C: I really felt that moment when he said "I'm not ready for you to grow up!"

It's a conflicting thing to see as a father, personally. 
$C: Kevin Bacon simply had no response after this.
$C: *Lego 


$C: My boyfriends kids just figured out that we're Santa.  All because of stupid wrapping paper.  Not even the Santa wrapping paper either, but the regular paper for everyone else's gifts.  They saw it, asked me what it was for, I told them it was for wrapping presents for my family, the oldest one thinks for a minute and says "Santa wraps presents too...Are you Santa?"  Damn fracking smart kids.
$C: This is lame.
$C: Hahaaha this kid is stupit of course Santa is reall!1
$C: Best ever. 
$C: This was awesome. Putting this one in the archives.
$C: Dude this is great
$C: well done!
$C: What an amazing journey
$C: This. Is. Perfect.
Thank you for posting this, made my day
$C: Dude.  Wow.  Amazing.  I don't even have kids(that I know of), but, damn, that conversation must be intense!
$C: This is the best thing on reddit I have seen in a long time,  very creative. Thanks to all involved. 
$C: This is spectacular. 
$C: I am late to work because of this but it is worth it.
$C: This...... I like this!!!!
$C: Invest now, this is headed for numero uno!
$C: WOW.  That was daggun incredible.  Thanks to whomever put that together, and the other guy for reposting it tomorrow for more folks to see.
$C: God damn that was intense. I want to be a fly on the wall when ever you talk to your kid
$C: All karmas away!
$C: I want to see this reenacted. So beautiful.
$C: That was a huge gif, but I could not stop watching it. Really awesome job on the video and the gif.
$C: This is the best thing I have ever seen
$C: the headshake pause "Daddy?" was hilarious
$C: This is amazing. My six year old and I have had similar conversations lately. 
$C: Dude that was intense, good fkn job. Ill need to watch that film now.
$C: >I know, but you were refusing to eat your vegetables and you were constipated.

As a dad that might be my favorite line.
$C: Brilliant 
$C: Wow..Wow...Bravo. 
$C: Fucking awesome.
$C: I can't believe I sat there and watched that whole thing. It was riveting. 
$C: Best gif this winter
$C: This....this is everything I never knew I needed. Thank you. Thank you. 

Thank you, Santa.
$C: high quality gif right here, folks 
$C: Holy fucking shit I just went on a journey
$C: I love how long this goes on and how I read it in their voices. 
$C: WTF No spoiler flair!?!
$C: This was really long and really engaging
$C: That was beautiful
$C: This may be the top post of all time and we were here to witness it
$C: So he's not real? Or is he? I need to know!

(Thanks for that - that was awesome!!)

$C: Woah... I'm gonna need a minute. ..
$C: Long long gif.  Worth every second of watching.
$C: That was awesom!
$C: Man that was intense! 
$C: I feel this gif needs a standing ovation.
$C: What a long but satisfying gif 
$C: shit im 19 and i still want santa to be real
$C: Ho ho holy shit this is awesome.
$C: Great job.  This is really good.  :)
$C: I'm absolutely dying over here, this is great.  At work and unsuccessfully hiding my laughter from the boss
$C: Damn Tom Cruise used to be fiiiiiiiiiiiiiine
$C: hehe, typically I hate everything I see on reddit. But this did bring a smile to my face.
$C: My kid is 4. I'm keeping this for a, hopefully not too soon, future date where I will need to harness a bit of Jack Nicholson as my son starts to ask too many questions.  Too many, damn questions...
$C: Is your wife the court marshall/judge? That was my favorite part. "Why isn't he asleep yet?!"
$C: I sat through all of this just to get to the "YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH"
$C: Fucking gold
$C: That was amazing... kept waiting for it to end but went on and on. Nice.
$C: What is the movie?
$C: This is the first funny /r/funny post I have seen in like 3 years. 
$C: Holy shit... I've never watched a .gif that takes me on such a roller coaster of emotions
$C: How old are you now, 10!!?

Mom (from the other room): 7!
$C: This took up most of my lunch break.
$C: Is it still going? 
$C: Fucking hilarious. Grown ass Tom Cruise calling Jack Nicholson "Daddy" and questioning the existence of Santa Claus. You have slayed me.
$C: This is awesome, but I don't know if I was ready for Tom Cruise to call Jack Nicholson daddy.
$C: Wow that was a very well written and hilarious!
$C: My step sister dresses as Santa for our get togethers. The kids are reaching the age though that they are starting to catch on. She wears a pillow under the suit and glasses to cover her face and my niece starts getting all super sleuth and grilling my step mom:

"If he's Santa then why does he sound like a girl?"

"Why does he have to wear sunglasses indoors AT NIGHT!" (she was really proud of this one)
$C: Holly cow... this is the longest GIF I ever watched in my life. I'd give you gold if I had one.
$C: Absolutely loved this GIF! Two thumbs up! Fun for the whole family!
$C: I really thought it was going to end about 8 different times but this was the gif that keeps on giving
$C: This got way too real, *way too fast*.
$C: It's the same reason you have to file a tax return with the IRS even though your employer and bank already sends them your financial info: Santa does not like a bullshitter.
$C: A few good kids?
$C: This....this is the best thing I’ve ever seen.
$C: Epic! I love it!! “The things you don’t talk about on the playground “ had me rolling.  Haha. Good one OP 🙌🏼
$C: I can hear this in Jack Nicholson and Tom Cruise’s voices. 
$C: Gif of the year 
$C: Holy bejeez, this better hit triple digits. It's too damn good.
$C: That was an emotional roller coaster. 
$C: That was intense!
$C: GIF of the year
$C: The greatest GIF of all time. 
$C: I have never identified with Col Nathan Jessup in that scene. But putting in the "I can have Mommy confirm that you said..." part sure did it. 
$C: This just made me really excited for the next few years of my life. I can't wait to make my daughter's dreams come true every Christmas. 
$C: This was a real roller coaster of emotion. 
$C: Fucking genius. 
$C: That was amazing.
$C: Wow amazing, so what is the original movie?
$C: It took me way too long to realize these weren't the original captions. 
$C: That was superb!
$C: This is absolutely amazing.
$C: Whats the original scene for this movie from?
$C: Thats the realest "Is santa real" conversation
$C: fucking hilarious!
$C: So long as Reddit exists, this will be a front-page post every Christmas from now on. Five, ten, twenty years from now; it’s just that good. Great job OP. 
$C: How much of my mobile data did you just use...
$C: This may be the greatest thing ever done on this site. Well done.
$C: ive never actually watched this movie? whats it called again?
$C: My four year old daughter had a question this year.  "If Santa is always watching, does he watch me when I go poop?"

Mom is now in charge of all Santa related bullshitting that needs to be done.
$C: Well played sir, well played.
$C: This was brilliant thank you.
$C: That is sooo good. 
$C: My daughter's 9. I worry that this might be the last year.
$C: that was incredible

$C: That was awesome. Made my morning, thanks mate and have yourself a very Merry Christmas to you and the family. Let’s keep the kids believing for as long as we can. :-)
$C: That's the funniest thing I've ever seen. And it happened to be oon reddit!!
$C: r/NOISYGIFS
$C: That whole section about how the parents pull the presents down and cover up reminded me about last month when we exposed the business to my daughter. She took it less than well with a moderate level hatred meltdown which culminated in her crying to her room screaming "There was even a Santa tracker!"
$C: DAMN.
$C: A fucking plus man. 
$C: That was excellent.
$C: Oh my god, that's freaking awesome!  Thanks for that.

Favorite part:

"Why isn't he asleep yet?"

"I'm trying."
$C: Jiffs that keep on giving and giving and giving and giving and giving and....
$C: I forgot how hot Tom Cruise was when he was younger.


$C: r/bestof
$C: I'm dying
$C: This made me lol
$C: Man, Tom Cruise was a handsome lad, eh? 
$C: Outstanding 
$C: It's folking awesome
$C: Absofuckingfantastic!!! That was amazing. 
$C: Bravo, well done!

$C: This is fucking beautiful
$C: This in itself is a Christmas miracle.
$C: Amazing.
$C: What oddly worked well was listening to Glacius's theme from Killer Instinct while watching this.
$C: Jesus Christ that was incredible. Well done
$C: Did anyone else get EXTREMELY uncomfortable when Tom called Jack Daddy?
$C: https://i.imgur.com/0mKXcg1.gif
$C: Well done!
$C: You're a genius OP
$C: Watching Tom Cruise call Jack Nicholson “Daddy” is strangely satisfying.
$C: Quite possibly the best GIF of all time. 
$C: This GIF better become one of the most upvoted posts on Reddit. This is absolutely gold
$C: This is amazing. 
$C: This makes me want to watch A Few Good Men again...
$C: What movie is this ?
$C: Goddamn, if I weren't poor I would gild this fucker so fast.     Excellent work OP, this is top 5 shit for sure. 
$C: That was just amazing. I can hear them speak the dialogue. 
$C: This is the greatest thing on reddit ever.
$C: This is the best thing I’ve ever watched. Absolutely amazing. 
$C: This is brilliant.

When my now 21-year old was about 10, he wanted a Nintendo DS. But he wanted a red one.

"Son, I don't think it comes in red."

"Daddy, the elves will make me one."

$C: /r/noisygifs
$C: What a beautiful gif
$C: Tom Cruise looks like Ronaldo. 

I've never noticed this before 
$C: this is one of the greatest things l have ever seen. 
$C: This needs the [googly eye version](https://media.giphy.com/media/ByUDWjce12r3q/giphy.gif) randomly strewn in there somewhere.
$C: that's the longest GIF i have ever watched
$C: There’s nothing I hate more than long gifs because you can’t pause them, you can’t look away for a second because you might miss an important second of it and you’d have to watch it again from the beginning to get it. Fuck this, seriously 
$C: I'm 38 and don't have kids, and this is just fantastic!  Thanks for getting my curmudgeonly ass in the Christmas spirit /u/Romobyl and /u/folkingawesome!
$C: Logic error: If you don't say loudly what you want for Christmas, then Santa isn't going to notice it. He can't read minds. But he can read letters, and those are a nice alternative to screaming out of your window at midnight.
$C: My son started asking questions about Santa this year... Didn't help that a friend told him Santa was fake. Mom stepped in like a champ to remind him that the friend was not necessarily bang honest, because he is currently grounded for lying. 

Hoping to have at least a couple more years of magic/wonder for him. 
$C: Bravo. Best GIF of 2017. 
$C: Well that was long
$C: It unsettles me to think of Tom Cruise calling Jack Nicholson Daddy 
$C: That was.. intense..
$C: Reddit is so shit. There are three of these posts now on the frontpage
$C: Twenty some years on the internet, I think this is the greatest gif I've ever seen. 
$C: This is what I wish r/HighQualityGifs was.

At least I think that is what it once was.
$C: Knowing Tom as a scientologist, he probably still writes a letter every year to compensate all his wasted money he put in that stupid sect
$C: My god this absolutely phenomenal! 
$C: My kids know that regardless of their actual belief Santa is very real..... and he brings all the good stuff. Otherwise it's just boxes of white socks. Individually wrapped. They always get socks and underwear.... but Santa gives the wishlist. 
$C: The answer: Santa cannot hear thoughts. You could want something and never say that you wanted it for some reason. Then, he wouldn't get you the right thing. Which is why he needs letters. _Kek_
$C: JFC this was long
$C: Sometimes you have to do something arbitrary because fuck you, do it. Every year in the US you have to file your taxes when the gov't could've done it for you -- get used to arbitrary ya little shit, it's gonna follow you to the grave.
$C: "Santa sees everything, but he doesn't know what you're thinking. He has lots of ideas about what you would like but he wants to know what you would like the best. And Santa likes getting letters."
$C: The kind of weird thing about me was that I don't think I ever believed in Santa.  I think my parents kind of half-assed it.  We did the whole small gift in the stocking and presents under the tree with "Santa" in the "from:" tag.  And I was alwa

But I think I figured it out when I recognized it as my mom's handwriting since she has a distinct fancy cursive way of writing.

Regardless, I was always thankful for the gifts they bought and even was very sad one Christmas when they bought me a [Nerf Razerbeast Gatling Gun](http://nerf.wikia.com/wiki/File:RazorbeastStockImage.jpg). I really wanted it, but since I was still young and small, I didn't have enough strength to crank the handle. I thought they'd wasted money on something I couldn't play with and I didn't know the concept of return policies at the time which Toys R' Us had an excellent one.
$C: A Few Good Elves.
$C: I'm told there's more but I can't get past, "Daddy..." lol
$C: I’ve never supported anything on Kickstarter but if there was a campaign to get actual dubs from the actors for this clip I’d be all in lol
$C: My 8 year old (oldest child) already asked. “Why do we have to tell Santa if he already knows?” I told him something about asking for the one present you settled on. He’s not dumb. This is my last year. I just hope he doesn’t tell his brother and sister. :(
$C: Why did it take me so long to realise that's not what they actually are saying? 
$C: Aw, man. Shouldn't have thrown down the GD at the end. Can't be talking to kids like that, nor share on Facebook where grandmas will be offended :P
$C: Santa is real
$C: Now I understand what is it like being deaf and watch movies with subtitles
$C: People forget that Jack Nicholson is actually the protagonist in that film 
$C: This has to be the longest gif I’ve seen
$C: When in the song does he hear anything?
$C: My best answer is "he does know what you want but its polite to ask santa to bring it for you, thats why we write a list." 
$C: ten year old kids gettin constipated now? damn
$C: I knew what happened but it was hysterical 
$C: You Sir just improved my shitty day a little bit. Thank you for this. I'm actually smiling right now
$C: 10 years old?  That's like 5th grade, right?

Yeah, they should know the truth by now. 
$C: The best part is easily the part where he tells him he had to eat his vegetables because he's constipated.
$C: Did I just watch a 3 minute gif?
$C: Ah, the joy of being Jewish.
$C: For the record, I'd like to state that Santa required things in writing for legal reasons. A while back, before he requested the list in writing, kids and parents tried to pull a fast one on him saying he didn't bring the correct presents and there was no way to prove that he was bringing what he was told. Now Santa has no worries about it because he keeps each years letters in a nicely organized file cabinet and can easily prove his innocence if any dispute comes up.
$C: **Transcript**

> You said that Santa Claus, “sees you when you’re sleeping.” “He knows when you’re awake.”

That’s right.

>“He knows when you’ve been bad or good.”

Correct.

>Daddy, I have just one last question before I go to bed on Christmas Eve. If Santa sees everything we do, and hears everything we say, then why do we have to write him a letter? Why would it be necessary to tell him what I want?

Santa Claus is a very busy man. He needs those letters to keep track of…

>That’s not what you said. You said “Santa sees and hears everything we do.”

That’s right, but…

>You said, “Eat your broccoli.” I said, “All of it?” You said, “Yes, because Santa Claus is watching.”

I know but…

>I can have Mommy confirm that you said…

I know what I said. But you were refusing to eat vegetables and you were constipated…

>Then why do we bother writing letters? Daddy?

Sometimes Santa needs a list to give to the elves…

>No Daddy, you made it clear a moment ago that Santa doesn’t need a list. He knows everything we do and say. So Santa shouldn’t need us to write letters at all, should he?

Please just go to bed now.

>You and Mommy put those gifts under the tree, don’t you? Because that’s what a bunch of kids at school are saying. And when I fall asleep, you sneak those gifts down from the attic. You fill the stockings with candy! You eat the cookies we leave on that plate, and even the carrots we set out for the reindeer! Just tell me Daddy. IS SANTA CLAUS REAL?

*Why isn’t he asleep yet?*

Believe me, I’m trying. You want answers?

>I think I’m ready to know.

YOU WANT ANSWERS?

>I WANT THE TRUTH!

YOU CAN”T HANDLE THE TRUTH! Son, we live in a world that has kids, and those kids grow up way too fast. How old are you now? Ten? And your little brother’s, what? Seven? I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom. You scoff at Santa Claus and you doubt his existence. You have that luxury. You have that luxury of not knowing what I know: That the Santa Claus story, while implausible, makes kids happy. And the gifts that suddenly appear on Christmas morning make kids happy! You don’t want the truth because deep down in places you don’t talk about on the playground, you want Santa to be real. You NEED Santa to be real. You asked for things like Legos, a skateboard, and a Nintendo Switch. You see these things as cool stuff you get for free just by asking. I see them as Christmas magic. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a boy who rises and sleeps under the official Star Wars bedsheet he asked for last year, and then question the manner in which he acquired it. I would rather you just said, “Thanks Santa,” and gently fall asleep. Otherwise, I suggest you put on headphones, and ignore the sounds coming from the living room. Either way, I’m not ready for you to grow up just yet!

>Is Santa Claus real?

In a sense, Santa Claus is the spirit of Christmas that lives inside all of us and…

>IS SANTA CLAUS REAL?

YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT HE IS.

$C: The longedt GIF I've sat through and worth every moment. 
$C: This is outstanding.
$C: Santa likes to know you care enough to write to him.

Adults like letters and cards.

We send cards to Grandma and your Auntie and everyone else and they KNOW we wish them a merry Christmas, but they still like to see it in writing.  Give Santa a break.  He has a pretty thankless job and just wants a letter.
$C: I did not expect to see you outside of r/cowboys OP...nicely done
$C: That right there was the single best gif I have seen on Reddit so far
$C: This has more gold than I have in real money
$C: “DID YOU ORDER THE CODE RED??”

“I ORDERED THE BAJA BLAST!!!”
$C: Me:  Posted to r/funny and r/highqyalitygifs?  No one ever gets two updoots from me.

Also me: you get two updoots from me.
$C: I was already enjoy the hell out of the gif, but when I saw the part about the headphones I knew I was watching something special
$C: Did anyone else kinda get feels from this?
$C: My question is... “be good for *goodness* sake”

When you are framing this about the guy who gives me presents.

Be good for presents sake!
$C: I know this scene well, watched the movie bunch of times, and wow.  You killed it.  For anyone who hasn’t seen the movie they probably don’t appreciate it as much.   Sir/madam,  Well done.  
$C: Santa may be forgetful, thus voiding the argument of the prosecutor, because if santa was omniscient yet at the same time forgetful, letters would probably help.
$C: The amount of people I sent this to that said "the volume doesn't work" is terrifying.

Subtitle meme's don't have volume noobs!!
$C: So I knew before hand, but like my family tried to break it to me "nicely". 

AKA; my older cousin knew the truth for years because he caught his parents. He was sworn to not tell "yet" for this very reason... the "magic" that kids get out of it.

So that Xmas Eve when they decided I didn't need to go on the long car ride back from Church to my Grandmother's, was the prime time to tell me. OK cool, like I already knew. I as like 11 or 12.

What I did next was the game changer. I asked if God was real too, because all his BS sounded like "magic" and I was not down with it.

Christmas morning did not go well for me that year, it was also the year that I stopped enjoying the holiday.
$C: Fuck man. With each line I leaned in closer and closer to the screen wonder more and more what would be the end. In no way was I disappointed. Utterly amazing.
$C: We write letters because it's the *polite* thing to do.  It's not to convey the information to Santa of what we want for Christmas, it's to convey the information to Santa that I am a *polite* boy who thus deserves consideration for the present of a Switch instead of showing himself to be someone who takes Santa for granted.

Come on guys, this is Christmas 101 stuff.
$C: "It's the polite thing to do. You want Santa to get you stuff, the least you could do is to write a letter to ask him."
$C: That scene is so iconic that I was hearing most of the dialog in my head. 
$C: Replace Santa Claus with God and Letter with Prayer...
$C: My mom always shut this conversation down with a simple “Santa doesn’t give presents to kids who don’t believe.” My 4 siblings and I are all in our twenties now, and we’ll swear up and down that Santa is real, at least, when we’re in our mother’s house.  
$C: Reddit thought they could release the top posts of the year.... And then here comes OP, right down santa Claus lane. 
$C: In the movie and in this gif, as well, 'you can't handle the truth' was the most intense moment.
$C: This kinda hit me in my feels. :(
$C: This is beautiful! 
$C: I only regret that I have only one upvote to give for this gif. 
$C: This is the best gif I’ve ever seen. 11/10
$C: The shear effort that went in to this, my lord. Take your upvote. This is the first time in my reddit career that I've felt upset that I have but one to give.
$C: This is nice
$C: I've never seen so much gold. 
$C: Let’s see this surpass the Guardians of the Galaxy gif.
$C: The kid is ten and is only questioning the validity of Santa now? How is that possible?
$C: Upvoted for the devotion it took to make this gif.
$C: You sir, have just won everything in the whole world.

Well done. XD
$C: This may be the best thing I’ve seen on Reddit. Well done. Well done. 
$C: OP’s rich now....
$C: Tom cruize (at this age) would be a perfect fit for an archer live action
$C: This is outstanding.
$C: The justification for telling the Santa Claus myth to kids is literally the same justification we use for adults concerning religion. 
$C: Incredible!  Well done OP.
$C: I want the upvotes to continue on this so that the reddit in 2017 post has to be revised.
$C: I kept a straight face till the remark about the Star Wars blanket...
$C: If you happen to catch this in your inbox, congrats on winning at reddit
$C: That was amazing! Pretty damn accurate
$C: 19 reddit gold in 5 hours time? That's like some kind of record.

Good job, OP.
$C: That was really well done. 
$C: It's hard to get past Tom Cruise calling Jack Nicholson 'Daddy'.
$C: Hahahaha, fucking brilliant. Loved how when I was reading it I was hearing it in my head as Cruise’s and Nicholson’s voices. 
$C: Congratulations r/romobyl for being gilded 26 times in last 6 hrs..!
$C: Bravo, sir. Round of applause for this outstanding performance in gifs.
$C: Damn, whoever made this put a shit ton of effort into this.
$C: This was extremely well done. Good job, OP.  :o)
$C: Simultaneously hearing both the subtitles amd the actual dialogue 
$C: Best gif in existence.
$C: This is the best thing I’ve ever seen on reddit.
$C: Is this the most guilded post of 2017? As of writing this, it's at 20 golds. 
$C: This isn't even funny. It's fucking thrilling. Bravo.
$C: Gold....so...much...........gold...
$C: I think... I think this shit just convinced me Santa is real. Afk to write him a letter!
$C: Now this is a damn high quality gif. No flashy moving text to make you think it’s clever, just funny writing the matches with the scene. Gif of the year.
$C: ...This is the best day ever!
$C: This is so  well done. 
$C: Jesus Christ that's intense
$C: Holy shit, this may just be the best reddit post I’ve seen. Bravo
/u/Romobyl
$C: A tour de force
$C: Really amazing stuff
$C: This is the greatest Few Good Men gif I have ever seen on reddit
$C: I'm convinced 
$C: Yes. I watched this until the end! You God Damn right I did!
$C: This is hysterical. Thanks and Merry Christmas!


$C: And you were constipated lmao
$C: GOLD!
$C: What movie is this scene from
$C: When they are 9-10, it's time to have the "Santa Claus lives within us all" talk.  
There is a greater purpose to the Santa Claus story.  It's about giving to others that have less.

$C: [Warning, you can never unsee. ](https://imgur.com/0jVIGeU)
$C: We need sound.... best ever!
$C: XD lol even more funny when you hear their voices in your head!
$C: As a Muslim who as a child tried to convince the kids around me that the idea of Santa was blasphemy, I find the entire myth absolutely fascinating. 
$C: LOVE THIS!!!!😂😂😂😂
$C: The list being for the elves is air tight. He doesn't have time to relay that shit verbally for every child.
$C: Now I understand that the purpose of the letter is a moment of self reflection. What do I really want? What are my priorities? Santa not only gives us gifts, he promotes out emotional growth as well. 
$C: wow tom cruise was really handsome when he was younger
$C: Man, I didn't see that coming...what a masterpiece 
$C: Bacause Sana Clause can't read minds. Plus, his memory isn't very good, so although he can see and hear everything, he has trouble remembering things. Which is why he needs letters.
$C: Definitely GIF of the year.
$C: Nintendo switch ad.
$C: Too good... too good
$C: That was awesome
$C: Wow I see someone’s gunning hard for the Oscar for Best Gif 2018.
$C: One of my favorite posts...ever
$C: They have just released annual summary of best reddit posts and now this bomb drops 
$C: Classic 😁
$C: I feel like this is the top voted post of all time but I have no idea how to check
$C: bravo
$C: I don’t remember these lines in the movie. Ah he he
$C: A - Freaming - Mazing
$C: OP this should be in r/HighQualityGIFs
$C: Did Santa give this post 20+ gold?

“You can’t handle the truth!”
$C: The movie in question is "Rules of engagement" a wonderful movie
$C: 2 actors that I love !
$C: Holy 20 gold and 174,000+ upvotes!! Completely deserved too! 
$C: I have never felt so satisfied after watching a feature length gif.

One request for next time though.  Could you put in trailers for other gifs before the main feature?
$C: 
"... You wouldn't eat your vegetables, and you've been constipated...".

This is gold.
$C: This is way too long
$C: Wow 22 gold for this at $4 a pop .... this is an $88 gif 
$C: Ok I get the GIF is great and all but HOW THE FUCK DOES IT HAVE 22 GOLD?
$C: That was actually pretty hard to watch. My brain knows that scene so well that it kept telling me the proper words. I was desperately trying to read the subtitles but my brain kept interrupting and telling me the way it should sound. 
$C: This is why I've never physically sent letters to Santa as a kid... I would only pray for what I wanted.
$C: [deleted]
$C: if you don't write santa a letter, he will still get you presents... he'll get you things that he *thinks* you might want based on his observations alone. the purpose of writing the letter is to indicate to santa if you have any preferences for what he should get you. santa may be omnipresent and has the ability to determine if someone is good or bad, but he's not a mind reader. 
$C: For some reason I lost it at “your brother what is he, seven?”
$C: Twenty two gold. Wow that is the most amount of gold I’ve ever seen!
$C: omg 200k upvotes and 22 gold 
$C: There are 4 stages in life: 
*1. You believe in Santa 
*2. You don't believe in Santa
*3. You become Santa
*4. You look like Santa
$C: so, uh, you got 36 gold from posting this on two different subs. I'm impressed.
$C: It just kept going
$C: This is without a doubt the longest gif I've never seen.

$C: What a masteriece.
$C: Whoever wrote this deserves an Academy Award for Best Screenplay.
$C: Bless you
$C: Anddd I need to watch a few good men again. 
$C: Holy shit
$C: I was so happy that it continued after "you can't handle the truth"
$C: This is brilliant. Thanks for posting. 
$C: u/shiyinthegreat 
$C: I saw an article of what I plan to do when my son who is four stops believing in Santa. If I can find it I'll link to it.

It was the story of a mom whose son stopped believing in Santa. She took him out to dinner and told him he was right Santa isn't real but now he is old enough for the truth. 

Now that he knows Santa isn't real he gets to be part of a bigger secret. He now can be Santa for someone else. Santa is about the idea that sometimes we do nice things for other people but we don't take any credit for it. He now had the chance to pick someone else and do something nice for them and say it was from Santa Clause.

Edit: I found an article about it.
https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Telling-Kids-Secret-Being-Santa-42821561
$C: Am I the only one that finds this actually very heartwarming?
$C: That shit was intense
$C: My wife works as a nanny for two young girls. (5 and 2.) She was driving them around, looking at Christmas light displays when she texted me, saying that they're going to be driving by our house and to put on the santa suit.  (I've got a Santa coat, because why not?)   
So I throw it on and head into the living room. We've got a Christmas tree set up right in the middle of the big bay window that faces out onto the street, so I turn my back to the street to hide my not-white-bearded face, pull on a santa hat, and pretend I'm putting presents under the tree.  
My wife pulls up with the girls, and the 5 year old takes one look and goes "OH SHIT IT'S SANTA" loud enough that I can hear it inside the house.  
Of course my wife gasps in shock, and the 5yo realizes what she's done.  "Oh no! Am I on the naughty list now?"  
"Well.. Santa's right there. I'm pretty sure he heard you."   
"DRIVE! DRIVE! DRIVE!"  
$C: Your family sounds like a Wes Anderson film.  That is a compliment of course.  Family dog at the meeting is the icing on the quirky cake.
$C: Longest but the best holiday gif I've ever came across. Bravo 👏👏
$C: What movie is this
$C: I just want to comment that I was here for the original.
$C: 200,000 upvotes
$C: Who else was reading this in there head with an English 10 year old boy accent 
$C: **IM DYYYYYYING OMG** 
“Why isn’t he asleep yet?” AHAHAHA
$C: how the fuck did this get 117k upboats in 4 hours
$C: This was too long... got bored, left...
$C: Yesssssss!
$C: I want to believe.
$C: This is great!
$C: Santa is the real life "Code red" that exists only among those who have inside knowledge.
$C: 👏🏻 slow clap
$C: /r/highqualitygifs is that way
$C: How does the adhd generation sit through that much unfunny shit?
$C: I always got Jesus and Santa Claus mixed up when I was a kid.

They both have very similar and seemingly omnipotent powers.
$C: This was not funny at all 
$C: He sees you when you're sleeping, he knows when you're awake, he knows if you've been bad or good.

Nowhere in that description is "he knows every one of your thoughts".

$C: It's amazing that parents think lying to their kids is justified because of "Christmas magic."  The amount of harm and distrust they create, even on a subconscious level, isn't worth the false and temporary enjoyment.  

tldr: parents who lie to their kids are bad parents.  Period. 
$C: But you also said that Santa is writing a list, and checking it twice. So the reason you write those damned letters is to make his job a-hell-of-a-lot easier!
$C: Legit Question here:

Parents. Did you choose to tell your kids the Santa story? Was it something they just picked up? Was there ever any debate in your mind about whether you'd allow your kid to believe in it? Does one get something out of that? 

I don't have kids yet,  look forward to having them but... I question the idea of perpetuating the fairy tail that is the Easter bunny and Santa and all that....
$C: For the last year I've been fantasizing about Trump losing it in a court hearing with his very own 'you can't handle the truth' moment about the Russian collusion.
$C: As part of our Christmas tradition we read both from the Bible and the “Yes, Virginia” letter. Just as Christ’s birth is symbolic of the love God has for His children, so too is Santa Claus symbolic for the love parents have for their children, and both passages help illustrate that. One day, my kids may ask if both of them are made up, and I’ll tell them the same thing: maybe, but the ideas and virtues they represent are real, and that’s what really matters. 
$C: Is Reddit platinum a thing? This fucking deserves it. Was able to hear the whole thing.
$C: This is my favorite gif I've ever seen.  

And believe me, I waste an incredible amount of time roaming the internet.
$C: I feel accomplished for sticking through and watching the whole gif!
$C: Santa doesn't need you to write the letter. He knows that *you* need you to write the letter. You need to write the letter in order to consciously decide and affirm what you want so you'll be unquestioningly satisfied when you get it.
$C: Very high quality gif.
$C: Excellent.  My 7 year old is slowly getting to this point too. 
$C: This might be the greatest thing I’ve ever seen on Reddit.  I literally watched it 3 times in a rowing smiling the entire time (trying not to laugh out loud at work)!
$C: This. Is. Amazing.
$C: Just perfect...
$C: best 17mb gif
$C: Holy shit that was intense and way too real !
$C: This was so amazingly awesome!!  Heard every word in their voices as well.. 
$C: My mother never lied about Santa. I always knew. Think she respected my intellect more than that and for that I can never thank get enough.

I was a realist since childhood.
$C: It makes me uncomfortable to see Tom Cruise call Jack Nicholson "Daddy."
$C: This is one of the best I've seen. If it is not on HQG get it over there. Pure META
$C: What are you going to do with 10 gold?
$C: Quality.
$C: To be honest, now that your kid realizes Santa isn't real, you should stop giving him gifts.

Hear me out. He'll get presents, but not just, "gifts": The moral spectrum of the world isn't black and white anymore. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Your kid just discovered it was you all along, so now he's got to work with you to get presents. Christmas will work this way until he is capable of getting presents for you. Then, when your old and grey, he'll come into your room with a Santa outfit on... shotgun in hand...

Ho... Ho... Ho...
$C: [Just - bravo, bra-motherfuckin'-vo.](https://i.imgur.com/ADtEhsi.gifv)
$C: We just never made Santa a thing, saves everyone the hadache of keeping up the charade. 
$C: Tell them the elves need the list so they can make the toys ahead of time. Santa is just the delivery man. 
$C: This is awesome!  Wish it was a video with sound!
$C: "Santa uses that letter to give to the elves so he doesn't have to write it down for every boy and girl. He makes sure they've been bad or good not what they tell the elves they want."
 :D

$C: Because Santa can't give you the 100 things you want, so he want a list of the things you really really want, he can see you and hear you but can't read your mind, also if it's in paper helps so you don't change your mind later, so he is sure what to bring
$C: my mom ruined it for me when i was young and got a duplicate N64 game from santa (i had gotten it from grandma also the night before), and she tells me "oh don't worry honey, i have the receipt in my purse"... uh why would you have the receipt?
$C: I'm just gonna say this gif is better than the actual movie
$C: outstanding! you get a gold star!

*you have to believe in the gold star, its more something you feel
$C: It's a great gif, but the beginning is way too repetitive. It needs to be trimmed down. There's just way too much back and forth of the "if he knows everything, why write the letter?" bit. We get it, get to the point.
$C: This is the best thing I've ever seen on redditt
$C: This is the best thing I've ever seen on redditt
$C: I've never been so emotionally invested in a gif.

Damn good job! 
$C: *sees 3 minute gif

"Nah."
$C: Watching a professional actor call an older man “daddy” is a very strange thing to experience.
$C: damn that was long lol
$C: OBJECTION!
$C: Let’s hope no kids who still believe in Santa sees this
$C: Santa sees you while you're sleeping and knows when you're awake, but he can't read your mind ^you ^little ^brat. 

Also, the real Saint Nicholas was a bad ass who beat bad mean with chains sewn into his sleeves, so when you hear that jingle-jingle-jingle, close your eyes, pretend to be asleep, and don't get out of bed til morning.
$C: If you don’t believe you don’t receive 
$C: Wouldn't have minded if it stopped after "you can't handle the truth".....
$C: r/gifsthatkeepongiving 
$C: tooooooooooooooo looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong
$C: [That's a paddlin'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKiLfH3DVGc)
$C: I think I was maybe 5 when my dad said, "Santa Clause isn't real...your mom and I buy all your gifts. That's just movies"

I was crushed, but got over it. I still got a Nintendo.
$C: He should have responded. ”Santa does hear everything but he does not have time to write it all down for the elves and thats why he need a letter”
$C: [deleted]
$C: Hmm. Never had this conversation growing up. I guess we just like avoiding difficult conversations in our household.
$C: I love that the lips synced at "I want the truth !" "YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH"
$C: The dad actually had a good point which was completely ignored my Tom Cruise: Even if Santa saw/knew everything, instructing his elves to acquire the presents (or whatever elves do) is quite a lot of work, and it's easier for the kids to help write what they want than for Santa to spend a huge amount of time telling his Elves what to do.

A second point is that even if someone sees/knows everything, that doesn't mean they have the ability to process it all and remember it/consciously understand it. For example, when you look at a landscape, there is a TON of data thrown at you, but you only focus on/remember certain parts, and hence while you may have "seen" everything, what you saw is only a fraction of the information that a photo of the same landscape would tell you.
$C: Why do you need to write down stuff? It's because he knows what you do, not what you are thinking.

Also it is an exercise of self-reflection.

Still, brilliant job!
$C: Santa sees and hears everything but his elves don't, he needs to keep track of it all for their sake and letters help.
$C: That is the longest GIF I've ever watched all the way through

$C: you better watch out

You Better Watch Out

You BETTER WATch out!

YOU BETTER WATCH OUT
$C: What movie is this 
$C: Well, obviously he needs the letters for his elves.  If he spent all his time writing down what every kid in the world wanted around Christmas, they'd never have time to build them.
$C: He see it all but is only able keep track of the good and bad things. He then uses the list you sent to check it against that stuff to see if you deserve it.
$C: My Mom told me that as long as you believe in Santa he brings you gifts. I'm 45 and I still believe in Santa and he still fills my stocking and leaves me gifts. 
$C: Dank.
$C: Oh, just take my upvote.

My stocking won't be empty, right?
$C: Easy. It's a common courtesy. If you expect someone to just hand you a free gift because you're a nice person, the least you can do is write them a letter.
$C: "He's making a list, checking it twice..."
$C: In Canada he writes back, it's part of a literacy program.

his postal code is H0H 0H0
$C: Christianity + Capitalism = Santa?

Not sure if it makes kids happy or not. It's just a thing some people do.

Neat gif.
$C: Santa definitely needs list. In the song your son quoted it says "he's makin a list, he's checking it twice. He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice" so he keeps a list of naughty and nice children and he even checks it twice confirming that Santa has some memory problems. So of course he needs a list of the children's presents as well. Your kid isn't very bright is he? 
$C: whats the name of this movie plz ??? 
$C: It's because he gets lonely at the north pole and wants to hear from  all the little kids ... Obviously 😉😂😂
$C: u/owenbelly 
$C: I don't recall when I finally figured out that Santa was fake but I do have the story of how my sister found out. Apparently we were all driving home, I was asleep, and my sister was annoying the shit out of my mom. My mom's rage kept building and building until she finally just snapped and yelled "YOU KNOW WHAT? SANTA'S NOT REAL!" I found this out when I was wrapping gifts with my mom a few years ago and I find it hilarious.
$C: This is amazing, but the end is messed up IMO. It should end with Jack yelling "NO SANTA ISN'T REAL!!"
$C: Santa needs letters so he had a physical reminder. Just becaise he sees and hears everything doesn’t mean he remembers everything. Why else would he have a list of who’s naughty and nice?
$C: I saw the googley eyed "You can't handle the truth" when he said it.
$C: Your son is rather advanced.... :) 
$C: I remember when my 2nd grade teacher told me Santa wasn't real...
$C: r/loudjifs
$C: I'm sorry, what movie is this from?
$C: Santa knows all, but putting it in a letter is just polite. 
$C: Every single "Daddy" made this so much better. A+ quality gif.
$C: Your son reminds me of Tom Cruise
$C: I love this scene so much. Absolutely hilarious to see it with this conversation, just marvelous haha.
$C: Longest gif ever?
$C: Favorite gif on here
$C: This was entertaining, great work.
$C: You just broke the Christmas meta...
$C: But santa *does* need a list. It's right there in the song. 
$C: Orrr just not like to your children in the first place?
$C: This is fucking perfect.

I could hear Tom Cruise's voice in my head.

It syncs up so well.


$C: I was just waiting for how they would set up the line, "YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!" Executed perfectly. 
$C: Longest gif I’ve ever had the pleasure of watching.
$C: holy shit what a rollercoaster

$C: Bravo
$C: Christianity in a nut-shell
$C: tldw
$C: Wow, That was way more engaging than I would have guessed. Great job to whoever made this.
$C: Perfection. 
$C: This was freakin hilarious!  In my mind i was saying the actual lines from the movie. Made it hard to keep up with the writing.
$C: My God, the singularity is real and its now.
$C: That's the best thing I have ever seen
$C: This was awesome 
$C: You don't have to write thank you notes to Santa
$C: I want to nominate this for something then vote for it twice.
$C: How many terabytes is this gif
$C: The letter is your end of the deal.  He sees you and hears you and can make your wishes come true.  In turn your roles are to not be an asshole, eat your vegetables and write that shit down.  Don’t believe me?  That’s fine.  Don’t fulfill any of tour obligations but don’t cry to me when things fall apart.  

Fucking kids. 
$C: I lost it at the Official Star Wars bedsheets.
$C: 171MB fuck me.
$C: This shit is freaking hilarious
$C: That was hysterical!
$C: *slow clap*, *tears fall from eyes*, *stand up*, *clap gets louder and faster*, "Thank you! Thank. You!"
$C: Can someone type out the entire transcript for me? that would be awesome
$C: That is funny. 
$C: And I thought Johnny Depp’s jawline could not be rivaled...
$C: /r/gifsthatkeepongiving 
$C: Holy shit, I love this movie and while I won’t have kids for a while, I fully anticipate this conversation going this way!
$C: That's one long ass gif 
$C: Holyshit this is a masterpiece 
$C: At 5s in I was like ok got it, a finger move away from hitting back, but it just keeps getting better.  By the two minute mark I was completely riveted.  A masterpiece.

Thanks Santa.
$C: I have never seen this movie, so for about half of the gif, I thought the subtitles were the actual dialogue and I was VERY confused.
$C: This is the best GIF I've seen anywhere on the internet. 
$C: Wow, that was intense.
$C: Haha omg this just made my day haha
$C: I could feel the heat between the OP and his son up here in Canada
$C: This brings me joy in many ways.
$C: This just...I couldn't look away. 
$C: Thank you OP! 

This is amazing 
$C: This is just really damn good.
$C: If you're having this conversation pretty sure your child is too old to be believing in santa.
$C: This is the best thing I’ve ever seen 
$C: Thank you, this is the highlight of my evening.
$C: This is brilliant!
$C: Fucking awesome. 
$C: Daaaaaaaamn! It made me tear up. 
One of the bestest for sure. 
$C: > Legos
$C: Nice xD
$C: I was terrified the gif would end too soon.  This was amazing.  My sons are 2 and 5 and so far there is zero doubt.  They're smart; I know the doubt will come.  As an adult, holy shit do I miss that magic.
$C: beautiful
$C: Give this man a medal. 

No, don't look at me, as if *I* have a spare medal. 
$C: I think this might be relevant here:

https://youtu.be/7xXlW0kOddw

$C: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PKjr3S6NxPo
$C: Brillliant. Thank you!! Merry Christmas 
$C: That was damn good. 👏
$C: Awesome!!
$C: My parents did the novel thing and actually told me the truth when I was a kid: Santa is dead
$C: santa needs a paper trail for the irs. that's why he needs your letters. he already knows what you want but the irs hassles him.

make your problems your kids problems when they ask too many questions.
$C: What movie is this? 
$C: Get ready Reddit this GIF will be posted every Christmas. It is now a holiday classic. 
$C: /r/gifsthatkeepongiving 

$C: what movie is this from?
$C: Title of the movie is 'A Few Good Men' if anyone is wondering.
$C: Bravo
$C: I really felt that moment when he said "I'm not ready for you to grow up!"

It's a conflicting thing to see as a father, personally.
$C: Usually I just go: "Ask mommy."
$C: Can I get a source link to this movie?
$C: r/loudgifs

$C: I'm glad I stuck this one out. Absolutely fantastic.
$C: So he can know that you are truthful to him.
$C:  What movie is his again?
$C: What movie is this?? Weird.
$C: Awesome! Probably my favorite GIF
$C: As a new dad, I'm going to save this so that I can check it for pointers when I have this same conversation with my son. OP, you're a god amongst men.
$C: Took until December but that's our .gif of the year. 
$C: Seeing Tom Cruise refer to someone as "Daddy" is as creepy as one would expect from Tom Cruise. 
$C: Amazing.
$C: Someone had a rough Christmas one year in elementary school
$C: I was always just confused why there were barcodes on everything
$C: That was genius 
$C: This was fucking amazing.
$C: Standing ovation
$C: Amazing. 
$C: Good fucking job man.
Have some milk and a cookie, you deserve it.

- Santa Claus, probably
$C: Lol love this 😹
$C: This was amazing!  Thanks for the laughs.  

Now I want to watch the movie too!
$C: He sees you when you're sleeping and knows when you're awake, but that doesn't mean he keeps a running tally of everything. He needs the goddamned letter to remind him. It's like submitting your own performance evaluation during the annual review in order to remind your supervisors what you've been up to all year. Sure, they may have a general sense, but you still want to put your best foot forward and remind them of your best moments and explain your worst, so you get that performance bonus in your stocking on Christmas.
$C: My palms are sweaty. 
$C: I love it.  I just can't read that fast.
$C: Bravo.
$C: HEEEEEERE’S SANTA!
$C: This was as sad as it was funny
$C: *Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they abound and give to your life its highest beauty and joy. Alas! how dreary would be the world if there were no Santa Claus! It would be as dreary as if there were no Virginias. There would be no childlike faith then, no poetry, no romance to make tolerable this existence.*

*We should have no enjoyment, except in sense and sight. The external light with which childhood fills the world would be extinguished.*

*Not believe in Santa Claus! You might as well not believe in fairies. You might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the chimneys on Christmas Eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if you did not see Santa Claus coming down, what would that prove? Nobody sees Santa Claus, but that is no sign that there is no Santa Claus. The most real things in the world are those that neither children nor men can see. Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of course not, but that's no proof that they are not there. Nobody can conceive or imagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable in the world.*

*You tear apart the baby's rattle and see what makes the noise inside, but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest man, nor even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever lived could tear apart. Only faith, poetry, love, romance, can push aside that curtain and view and picture the supernal beauty and glory beyond. Is it all real? Ah, Virginia, in all this world there is nothing else real and abiding.*

*No Santa Claus! Thank God he lives, and he lives forever. A thousand years from now, Virginia, nay 10 times 10,000 years from now, he will continue to make glad the heart of childhood.*
$C: Not the ending we deserved, but the ending we needed. 
$C: This is magic right here.
This is this future magic we were all dreaming about in the 80's and 90's.

Greatest gif of all time!
$C: You shouldn't tell your children lies with obvious theological incongruencies.
$C: Oh man, I'm not ready for the day when my future kids question the existence of santa claus. 

also, nice job including the nintendo switch 
$C: I totally read this whole thing in their voices.  This is awesome.
$C: This is amazing. 
$C: GD thats like half the movie there.. good job.. oh and comment number 800. Suck it 799 and 801..
$C: This may replace the "Yes, Virginia" letter as my Christmas Eve Facebook post.

Also there is something creepily satisfying about watching a young Tom Cruise call Jack Nicholson "Daddy."
$C: We need an oscars for gifs... call them the  giffys .. this wins best performance by a gif in a dramatic subtitling 
$C: This is amazing. My co worker asked me why I was so smiley. Now I want to see this movie.
$C: Oh my god... I'm dying. 
$C: Lmao you were constipated
$C: Legendary gif. 
$C: Did you order the Code Red on Frosty????!!!
$C: I'm just here for the inevitable gold train. Choo choo
$C: and this is why you don't do year end reviews of reddit, /u/redtaboo, until the 31st of december.


$C: My then 8 year old oldest daughter pulled this on me with absolute conviction, I said welcome to the one REAL conspiracy supported by billions of human beings. There is only one conspiracy with an even larger membership but I shalt not name them.
$C: Some of you are so desperate for Santa to be important to your kids. They'd have just as much joy and wonder if you gave them the gifts yourselves.
$C: I bet Tim Allen takes this and uses it in Santa Clause 5: A Few Good Elves.
$C: This is excellent, OP.  👏
$C: Wow this is awesome. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Do people actually use Santa to get their kids to be good? I don't remember ever thinking that Santa might not bring me presents.
$C: With a kid on the cusp of the anti-Santa fad, this .gif genuinely made me tear up. Well done!
$C: It's so weird how I hear his voice from the gif when he says the last line.
$C: "You want me on that sleigh!  You *NEED* me on that sleigh!"
$C: wants expecting I'd watch that to the end. that was one gripping story!
$C: holy shit...i didnt know gifs could be this long lmao. 
$C: Phenomenal, thank you!
$C: This is one of the best things I have seen on Reddit
$C: Wrap it up boys, nothing is gonna top this 
$C: Lmfao 
$C: Damnit, now I’m in tears thinking about my kid not believing in Santa. He just started showing an interest in Mall Santa, I’m not ready for this!
$C: I forgot how hot Tom Cruise used to be....
$C: This is genius. Santa
$C: Can I get a transcript of this? 
$C: [deleted]
$C: This is beyond awesome, thanks op!
$C: What movie is this from?
$C: Good luck sir! God speed! 
$C: I'm both laughing and sad crying.
$C: Someone needs to get Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson to do this.

I need the Audio...
$C: Tom Cruise had a great nose job since then.  
$C: I never got to believe in the magic of Santa Claus :(
$C: that was intense
$C: Perfect.
$C: r/highqualitygifs
$C: Awesome!!! It just kept going lol
$C: As a parent with kids that age, that evoked a surprisingly emotional reaction out of me.
$C: This is just.. This is beautiful. The book stops here fella's- No more GIF's. The one has been found. 

$C: I envision this being the next "Hitler Rant" meme. Reddit, don't let me down!
$C: That was beautiful
$C: I am in tears. This is amazing. 
$C: FUCKING GOLD. I've never laughing so hard over a GIF before, thank you.
$C: This is absolutely brilliant.
$C: I fucking cried laughing at this!
$C: Source?
$C: This is art.
$C: Art. This is art.

The second half was real AF. 
$C: Just a sheer GIF masterpiece. 
$C: what is this clip from?
$C: One updoot is just not enough. I want to double-doot this gem!
$C: Oh my god that was amazing. I laughed and cried.
$C: Wow, that's was good.
$C: This is the best thing I’ve ever gotten out of Reddit. Fucking BRAVO! This is epic. 
$C: INSTANT KARMA LMAO
$C: That's one loud gif.
$C: I loved every moment of this
$C: Bruh...😂😂😂
$C: "If you have to ask you aren't ready for the answer."
$C: We now need to get Tom and Jack to reenact this... Holy crap that was good.
$C: Source

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_frM44bBMfA
$C: Can we make this a thing? Like the parody subtitles to Hitler's rant scene in Downfall? Please?
$C: This is absolutely brilliant. Well done. (Slow clap)
$C: A+++++++++++++++++++++
$C: If there was ever anything good to come off of reddit, in my eyes, this would be it. Thank you.
$C: this is the best gif i have ever witnessed
$C: If the GIF ended right after saying Nintendo Switch it would have been just as good as he extra minute after 
$C: Genius, truly!
$C: GIF was so long my phone's screen turned off. 
$C: Updoot for using A Few Good Men. Fucking awesome movie. And awesome gif. 
$C: Had Santa spoiled for me by my mother at the age of 6 or 7, because she didn’t agree with my dad telling me he was real. Dad told me 7-8 years later that even if he wasn’t really the one giving the presents, they still came from and because of him, because without him they wouldn’t be given.
$C: I have tears in my eyes. 
$C: This is fucking glorious. 
$C: This was absolutely beautiful.   But he could have just said.  Yes he sees everything you say and do but he has an absolute shit memory so needs the list.   He also has terrible writing and can never read his own. 
$C: As a father of a VERY inquisitive four year old, this hit me harder than it should have.
$C: Can someone tell me why gifs on imgur won't play on my phone?
$C: This may be the best post I have ever seen in my 5 years of redditing.
$C: Have an upvote.  Excellent.
$C: r/gifextra ?
$C: So you are telling me...
$C: This is the greatest thing I’ve seen on reddit. Bravo 
$C: This was absolutely amazing.
$C: Same could be said for prayer.
$C: Well that was a great way to start my day lol
$C: Too long fuck it
$C: I have never felt more intensity in a gif
$C: This is a HighQualityGif, not meta shit
$C: I never understood why elves in Santa's workshop would be working on making me a Gameboy I mean how you gonna make a Gameboy you would have to get one from Nintendo. Also we lived in an apartment so we had no chimney. ???
$C: This may be the best gif I have ever seen 
$C: Jesus! This is pure gold. Amazing work!!
$C: Best gif ever made
$C: This is amazing.
$C: That's the best long-ass GIF I've ever sat through, and worth ***every fucking second!!!***  Thank you!
$C: I mean, you could say that the letter is part of it because it shows Santa who cares enough to write him a letter. Santa prioritizes those kids first before the rest.
$C: I love my gay dead son 
$C: Buddy I work with has 5 kids from ages 4 to 17, and I asked him how he does the balance of believing in Santa for the kids. His answer is, "In my house, if you don't believe, you don't receive." He said it works great.
$C: This is god damned glorious!  Well done!
$C: I hope my daughter questions Santa the moment she can talk. Let her find out he’s fake asap 
$C: The Gif that keeps on Gif'ing
$C: Have an upvote for Santa!  I still believe!
$C: This is art.
$C: FUCK I exited out at is Santa Clause real god damnit
$C: I haven't seen this movie and it took me about 40s to realise that those weren't the actual subtitles. 
Not my proudest moment.
$C: Epic
$C: This is my favorite GIF of all time. Thank you for brightening up an otherwise terrible day. 
$C: I was watching this at work knowing at any time my boss could walk by and see me watching it and I could get in trouble... but I couldn't close it... even when I thought I heard footsteps, I didn't want to miss a part and ~~have to~~ get to rewatch it all.
$C: Damn, that was intense.
$C: Brilliant! Is it wrong of me to be reading the text out as the characters played by Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson. 
$C: For some freaking reason I can't get Imgur stuff to load on my phone like 90% of the time...it just has the green arrow button and freezes like that, then if I refresh, it disappears! Anyone have a solution aside from going on my PC? Samsung Galaxy S8+ if that helps anyone...
$C: we-have-been-discovered.gif
$C: What movie is this?
$C: holy shit
$C: This is the best gif I've ever seen :0

And now I believe in Santa again
$C: Was not prepared for the feels. 
$C: Am I the only who can't keep up with the subtitles? I swear I went to college!
$C: This will be the stuff of reposts for decades.
$C: This is the best.
$C: How do I upvote something more than one time?
$C: How do you make gifs that long?!

$C: I feel like Tom calls lots of older men daddy.
$C: I was mostly amazed at my sheer will to watch the entirety of this GIF
$C: This is the greatest gif of all time.
$C: It’s even funnier when you read it in their voices!
$C: This is just... amazing. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.
$C: Thank you for sharing this. 
$C: Best one I’ve ever seen.
$C: My oldest is in 1st. I haven’t even started to fathom “the talk” with them. Just let them believe!
$C: This may be the funniest gif I've ever seen. Well written, well played. 
$C: Great job ! This is awesome, every second of it!
$C: What movie is this?
$C: I wish this what you watch on jury duty
$C: 3 mins. Nobody have time for that 
$C: Damn this is some high quality gif right here.
$C: This is incredible
$C: That gif was worth every second.
$C: Might be the best on Reddit this year
$C: I was five when I figured out that Santa wasn't real.  I kept my mouth shut and milked it until I was eleven.
$C: This is brilliant. The cuts, the fact that you can so easily assign which speaker is currently speaking. The tone and cadence of the gifs in sequence.

Absolutely brilliant.
$C: Redditsilver!
$C: Can we get the inevitable reboot, done on this premise?
$C: Whoa, tom cruise is the same age now as jack was in this film. 
$C: I sincerely enjoyed this.
$C: Can this be more epic???
$C: fucking hell this is great, you deserve platinum not gold
$C: Uhh...
*raises hand*


what film is this from?
$C: What movie is this?
$C: That was amazing. 
$C: This goes beyond perfection! xD
$C: Because writing a letter asking for something is considered polite, and Santa loves politeness.  That's why you leave cookies out.  Just because he knows what you want, that doesn't mean you shouldn't properly ask for it.
$C: I really to to watch the actual movie...
$C: It is all fun and games until your son sends you to leavenworth.
$C: I would give you gold if I have any
$C: fucking awesome i loved it!!!! 
$C: Clever and funny. Haven't laughed out loud during a HQG before - this was the one. Really sucks you into the narrative and needs to be seen on a larger screen than a phone. Thanks! 
$C: Everything about this is true. This gif is like a documentary of my Decembers.
$C: Fucking brilliant. 
$C: "I WANT THE JUICE!!!!"
"YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE JUICE!"
$C: This is fantastic. Maybe the best thing I've ever seen on Reddit. I just want to thank you for posting this, have a good Christmas.
$C: nice
$C: Bravo 
$C: Who the hell is your son? Chief Justice John Roberts?
$C: This is a masterpiece.
$C: This is amazing. as a parent got a little throat lump. thanks. 
$C: Well fuck, I believe again.
$C: This is THE BEST!
$C: Holy shit that was long but the payoff was amazing.
$C: you are the best.
$C: Fucking brilliant
$C: This is just perfect.
$C: What a ride! (Sleigh, obviously)
$C: I've been thinking this for years.  *Literal years.*
$C: This belongs on topshelfmemes.com
$C: What movie is this from?
$C: Cmon kid, is not the end of the world. Your world maybe but who cares...
$C: Bravo sir, bravo.
$C: Jesus Christ this is... perfect... props to you, friend.
$C: [Bravo sir, Bravo](https://giphy.com/gifs/F2WFyAfpfVfFe)
$C: Best fucking GIF of 2017!
Case Dissmissed! 
$C: Man, some people spend far to much time on these. I thank them dearly for their sacrifice.
$C: Seriously, the longest GIF I've ever take the time to watch.
$C: I feel like I watched the whole damn movie with that .gif.

As a father,  LOVED IT!!
$C: I would have just told him it's because Santa likes getting letters. Even if he already knows, it makes Santa happy.
$C: Man, am I glad I sat through to the end. Brilliant!
$C: The solution https://imgur.com/gallery/qHrK6
$C: Holy fucking shit the effort.
$C: Me and my dad will do the same except I'm 26, he's 50 and we'll both be pissed as farts on a combination of beer, whisky and mojitos.
$C: The real question is "is the Joker real?"
$C: Outstanding Private Pyle!
$C: It's long, but the very end makes it all worth it. 

Well done, sir. 
$C: 7 golds and my phone won't load the stupid video
$C: My friends kid had their version of santa claus killed by a friends dad.  It really really hurt the kid.  I honestly don't understand why parents keep this myth going (especially agnostic ones).  The story of the actual man is interesting and great enough to justify remembering him during a time of celebration and gift exchange.  Parents don't need to lie, they choose to.  It's like they was their children not to trust them.
$C: If I could give gold you would have it sir , that was amazing. I just got done watching that movie. 
$C: "Believe me, I'm trying!"

Had me rolling 😂
$C: This is why Im on reddit
$C: TL DR
$C: I think I laughed too hard at this. Take my upvote, goddamn it! 
$C: I know this is entirely in me for having never seen this movie, but it was weird seeing Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson in the same clip. Worlds collide, damn.
$C: Brilliant. 
$C: This is amazing 
$C: 10?! i found out there was no santa when I was 5
$C: Wow. Really wow I don’t have any words. 
$C: That was more gripping than the movie itself.
$C: Come on, that hardly is a line of questioning that should bring that much trouble.

Why do you need to write letters to Santa?

A appeal to pragmatism:

There's 7 billion people. Santa can check on all of them at the same time and see who's good and who's bad. He then keeps the list of which kid is which, but he does this by writing these lists very quickly. He cannot do this with the lists though. If he was able to really quickly write down the list of what you wanted, get the whole thing in a second for each kid, it would still take him 31 years for 1 billion good kids! So Santa doesn't really handle telling the elves what kids want, he can check and make sure they are doing the job correctly, but he doesn't tell them what it is what you want. It's many elves that read the letters and make sure you can get your gifts and make sure you're in the nice list. Now elves are magical, but not as magical as Santa, they do not know everything you do, instead they need to get your letter to know what you want and get to working. Kids who don't write the letter may still get a present, but Santa rushes writing down what they want so quickly, that the elves sometimes read it wrong and get you the wrong present. It's better to send your letter to make sure they can see it.

(you can add this to the above: *"Even if Santa could write down the letters himself..."*)
An appeal to emotion.

It makes Santa really happy to receive the letters. Think about it you know your dad and mom love you. But it still makes you happy hearing that they love you, and getting hugs, and kisses and all that. Why would you need to get this if you already know they love you? Because it's nice to get something that shows what we know. Santa knows what you want, but he really enjoys receiving letters and reading them, he keeps his favorite and reads them throughout the year to make him happy knowing how such a good kid got such a good present. He makes you so happy with the presents already, why not make him happy by sending the old man a letter?

And when they respond that their friends are into Santa, an appeal to fear:

Santa doesn't visit kids who are too grown up to believe in him. So when other kids tell you that its their parents that put the gifts, it's probably true, they don't believe in Santa so its their parents that need to put the gifts under the tree. You know how capable we are of giving you gifts, we can't compete with Santa.. but if you don't believe already then I guess it's too late...

Source: have tricked kids into believe I never slept and only occasionally ate a bit of chilli powder on the mornings.
$C: Bravo
$C: As someone who has had this monologue memorized since my freshman year of high school (circa 1998), I would just like to applaud OP for their attention to detail. The choices made between what words to keep original and what to change, it’s simply spot on my good friend. 
$C: I felt like I was really sucked into that...

$C: Santa sees you and knows if you’ve been bad or good but that doesn’t mean he remembers everything he hears or sees. Even God has stuff written down. Why do you think he made the Bible? 
$C: For a moment, I thought the OP got snubbed with the gold, but he posted here too.
$C: "NOW GO TO YOUR ROOM! I WANT TO PLOW MOMMY!"

"And that's how I traumatized my son"


$C: You are a God, sir
$C: This is great!
$C: It started out funny but it just go too fucking real. God, I hate the feels.
$C: Fucking brilliant. This is perfection. 
$C: This made me so happy. Thank you OP.
$C: Brilliant, pure Brilliance.
$C: Nice one. It's amazing how you can replace Santa with any god and it would all still work.
$C: you Sir, deserve yourself some !redditsilver 
$C: Well the easy answer to this is "Yes, he can see and hear everything we do, but he can't read our thoughts. Have you said everything you want out loud? No? Then how will he know everything you want? That's why you write a letter"
$C: The mother of all gifs!

I feel like this was made for me, I recite this scene verbatim around the house, for no reason, several times a week!
$C: Who would say that this is the gif of the year?

Because I would
$C: so dramatic

$C: I salute you who made this .gif. One day it will hang in the galleries of the world with all the other great artists! 
$C:  If there was an epic gif, it would be this one. And if you can't handle that, you can't handle the truth! 
$C: This just got better and better. Amazing
$C: This is the greatest thing I’ve ever seen 
$C: About the list thing, isn't santa writing a list, checking it twice, working out who's been naughty or nice? So the list thing is pretty canon for santa. 

I honestly thought with the isn't santa always watching line of questioning, he was gonna ask if santa was a pedo
$C: F'IN BRILLIANT !!!
$C: Can I have permission to perform a slow clap?
$C: This is too good 
$C: This is possibly the most well thought out, hilarious thing I’ve seen in quite a while. Thank you for the laugh. P.s. this movie is hella good
$C: That's one long ass gif
$C: I would so pay money to see Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson perform the exact same scene with this lines instead.
$C: Your kid is one smart lawyer 
$C: This should be the most upvoted gif ever
$C: This is a masterpiece. 
$C: Fantastic script. But equally some very fine acting there! 
$C: Why isn't he asleeping yet?
Believe me I'm trying! Best part, I'm crying 
$C: What's the name of the movie again?
$C: Claps slowly...
$C: I watched the whole GIF only to miss the end because my son came over to distract me...
$C: This is the best thing I’ve seen all year. Thank you! Happy holidays!
$C: Maybe the best gif of the entire 2017. Simply perfect.
$C: /r/Gifsthatwontend
$C: You can't handle the truth!!!
$C: This was way deeper then I was hoping it would be..
$C: Santa may hear and see everything, but he can't read thoughts. What if I secretly wanted something but didn't tell anyone? I would put that in the letter. Or if I was pressured by people to say what I wanted I might blurt something out to shut them up, but that's not what I wanted. A letter clears this up.

Also, letters would be easier to give to the elves then Santa having to babysit and say what to make.

That's what I would tell my kids, but maybe in a simpler way. 
$C: Thank you for this
$C: Can I triple like this? Goodness, I practically had this same conversation with my eldest!
$C: Worth watching to the end, well done buddy
$C: This gif is only missing it's t as the best thing I've gotten all year. Bravo OP. Bravo. You are a God among men
$C: It was so intense. I need to take a walk to relax.
$C: **YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT HE IS!**
$C: I thought for a shameful amount of time that this was a christmas movie I hadn't seen yet. 
$C: Jesus, I'm just glad I was on a toilet when I found this. Pure genius man! 
$C: "why?  because he might know what you do and what you say, but he does not know what is truly in your heart and by writing him a letter, you give your wish form.  You've probably said that "this was cool" or "wow I'd want one of those".  but at the end of the year, you know what you really want, and you would be disappointed with those other things.  This is why we write the letter.  This is why we ask our reward for being good.  By writing.  The. Fucking. Letter."
$C: Just one thread in another post an hour ago I said I would likely cut my internet connection very soon.

And then this comes along insisting that I reconsider because it's so full of awesome.

Well played, internet.
$C: Or maybe just don't lie to your kids in the first place? "Santa isn't real, your mom and I work very hard so we can buy you presents for Christmas. Those presents represent how much we love you and want you to be happy which is why we worked so hard to be able to afford them for you. Cherish them as such." Now you aren't lying to your kids and they actually understand the value of the gifts given to them which will make them treat those gifts all the better.
$C: What movie is this? 
$C: Goddamn, it’s the Carolina Wine Mixer.
$C: Thank you!
$C: This is goddamn Amazing
$C: u/figgityfuckmeright 
$C: So in this scenario, your wife is the cynical black judge?
$C: To my future children, 

Santa may or may not be real, but one thing I can tell you is this: if you don't believe in him, he sure as hell won't be bringing you any presents.

What's that? Faith restored? I thought so. Go to sleep. 
$C: This is incredible.
$C: this is damn good
$C: Is it weird that I think it is just as powerful as the original? lol
$C: I can hear voices while watching this video.....
$C: From what movie is this?
$C: This is amazing
$C: Wow.  Well done.
$C: Far out that was brilliant! I've never been so captivated by a GIF before
$C: This is just fudging fantastic 
$C: This is the greatest thing ever!
$C: Did i stand up clapping in my living room... Yup!
$C: That gave me goose bumps that was so amazing!!! 
$C: That escalated.. slowly.. 
$C: Literally just watch the golds accumulate. Much earn. 
$C: Well, that escalated quickly...
$C: That was great
$C: That was a very long gif and i wish there were a way to pause it but very good none the less
$C: This is to emotional for this sub..... But thanks it was a pleasure just the same. 
$C: This is to emotional for this sub..... But thanks it was a pleasure just the same. 
$C: Just...wow.
$C: This may be the single greatest thing I've ever seen.
$C: Conversations like this with my parents are why i became a lawyer. 
$C: This is fantastic
$C: /r/gifsthatlastjustlongenough
$C: This has to be one of most well thought out gif's I've seen. Bravo!
$C: When does r/funny get renamed to r/HighQualityGifsReposts ?
$C: Ya tell them he see and hears everything, that doesn’t mean he remembers.
$C: This is the best thing I have seen on reddit, ever.
$C: Fucking A* 
$C: I keep seeing this GIF, what movie is this from?
$C: This just made my day :D.. love how it gets so real and simultaneously hilarious. Props to you OP!!
$C: awww man, why did TC have to be cult crazy. he was fun to watch
$C: Holy shit the "go to bed" part lip syncs perfectly. 
$C: I find it kind of funny  
I find it kind of sad 
$C: I get the whole magic and whimsy of santa, my family had me believing in him to...and yet, I feel like I would have enjoyed the gifts more knowing that they were from my mom who barely understands what a Nintendo is but, damn it, her son wanted one and she was gonna get it for him... without magic Santa powers!

Also. Fucking amazing gif, haha.
$C: *Rises up and starts to slow cap to the OP”
$C: Santa likes penpals

Santa wants to hear from you directly, maybe you've said out loud something you want but deep down you actually want something way more.

It's ok for Santa and kids to have secrets.
$C: just remember what my dad used to tell me before.... exact the same =-0

$C: The bit about “you wouldn’t eat your vegetables and you were constipated” is utter gold. The futility of those types of situations are *truly* the things only parents would understand. This is amazing. Thank you. 
$C: Kid: "Did you order the Nintendo Switch?" 

Parent: "YOU"RE GODDAMN RIGHT I DID!"
$C: Santa is the force in Star Wars 
$C: let's not even mention the whole "praying" thing to an omnipotent being
$C: On a serious note, what a great fucking scene from a great movie. 
$C: What movie is this?
$C: DID SANTA ORDER THAT CODE RED?!?!
$C: Goddamn I love Aaron Sorkin. Excited to see Molly's Game when it comes out.
$C: Should mark for spoilers 
$C: *CANDY CANE DROPS*
$C: My kids have always known the truth, and they are still happy on Christmas, without the namby pamby bullshit lies made up to reinforce religious stories. 
$C: Is this a HQG?
$C: Does anyone else think he gave it up when he said manner in which HE aquires it. 
$C: I've seen this scene too many times. I can hear the actual words Nicholson is saying.
$C: because he can't read your mind and some kids might not know exactly what they want
$C: My pizza is here ...
$C: Is it strange I can hear this gif?


$C: Repost 🙄
$C: What movie?
$C: I watched it entirely. Longest gif ever but worth every second 
$C: Man enjoyed every second of this. Imagining Tom Cruise saying “Daddy” multiple times kept cracking me up
$C: It would be cool to see this done with God in place of Santa. :) 
$C: /r/noisygifs
$C: Worlds longest gif
$C: You know, I've never actually seen this movie because I megaloathe Tom Cruise. But I heard that gif, and I got caught in the dialogue. Maybe I should set aside my dislike.
$C: I want to watch A Few Good Men now. 
$C: somebody's got way too much time on his hands
$C: 1992 Tom Cruise would've been perfect to play Sterling Archer. 
$C: You mean to tell me this kid believes Santa doesn't keep a list? Then how's he supposed to know who's naughty or nice? 
$C: Mark it nsfw 
$C: Dude this is amazing! 
$C: This is fucking amazing
$C: This is by far the longest GIF I’ve ever been willing to sit through.  
$C: same with christianity
$C: I posted this on my team's, slack Christmas channel. Got nothing but crickets, bahumbug to them.
$C: That's a good parody.
$C: The facial expressions are what make it great. 
$C: Because he cannot read your mind. Not everybody says what they want out loud. 
$C: This was made in July & OP has been sitting in it. 
$C: Should say that it's because if everyone speaks at once Santa can't hear everyone's individual christmas lists. Letters are far more sensible.
$C: I have a feeling I should know this but what movie is this. I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan so most of his movies I avoid but this was really well done.
$C: Congratulations, probably the best HQG I have ever seen.
$C: When I was a kid I never wrote christmas lists cause my logic was that Santa could see me and hear my wishes, my Mum did not like this logic.


$C: This needs to have a voice-over right now. That's all I'll ask for Christmas. 
$C: Tell him santa needs a paper trail
$C: commenting in epic gif thread
$C: I’m going to get crucified for this but what’s the movie title for this one? I remember seeing as a kid before I could understand it. 
$C: Watching the upvotes jump by the thousands every few seconds now.
$C: This is a terrible argument.

Santa can see you and hear you, but unless you say what you want, he doesn't know. 

And his memory isn't great. He's watching, but he's making lists in the process. Lists that he needs to check twice to make sure he has the naughty kids straight from the nice ones. What I'm saying is, Santa is aware of what you're doing, but he's watching a lot of kids and he needs things on paper to keep them in order. 
$C: "You WANT Santa to be real"
$C: I have two sons and I too say things like, “how old is your brother now? 4?”  
$C: R/highqualitygifs 
$C: This was amazing! Great work. 
$C: r/showerthoughts
$C: He needs the letters to know what you want or need enough to write it down and ask a semi-omnipotent immortal Norseman for.

It's simple, really. He knows what you're saying and doing, but not what you're thinking. He doesn't want to know what you're thinking. He just wants to know what you're saying and doing because that effects others. That's your behavior. Santa wants to know if you've been naughty or nice. The letters are his way of knowing what you really desire enough to ask for. Even if they don't reach him at the North Pole, which he would like if they did so he doesn't have to remember as much, he can see that you've made the written request.
$C: But... What about Jesus Christ dad?
$C: r/gifsthatendtoosoon
$C: “I can have mommy confirm...”

“I know what I said!”
$C: Why is this a gif?

Also, this is the longest gif I've ever seen
$C: This. Was. A. Journey. 
$C: Still a better political drama then attack of the clones
$C: OP has enough gold to last til next Christmas,where he will have to update us on how this confrontation went.

Each year he will come back and tell us the story of his child's evolving awareness of the cultural myths we have and our moral struggles of whether we should pass them on to our children.

Good luck, OP. 
$C: This shit is way too long to watch to wait for a predictable punchline
$C: *funny witty and/or relatable comment trying to gain delicious karma by leeching off front page*
$C: I freaking lost it at the Star Wars blanket
$C: That’s very good acting, you can *feel* their anger, yelling and frustration

also good gif
$C: What I would do to have Jack Nicholson stuff my stocking.
$C: The upvotes right now are coming in at the rate of 100/sec !
$C: This is the greatest GIF I have ever seen in my life.
$C: Almost 100k in 5 hours
$C: "Because even though he knows, Santa wants you to say it. Just like we always say we love you."
$C: This just restored my belief in Santa
$C: Wow so true!!!!
$C: Commenting to be a part of the soon most upvoted post on reddit!
$C: I was about 10 when i was told he didnt exist, I don't remember being overly bothered since I think kids at school had already said something.  But my parents basically said, look, santa isnt real, but that's not the point, the point is do you want presents, if you do then you have to behave, if you don't then you get less presents, it's how life works.


$C: Haha this is hilarious, there should be a whole sub for this. Maybe not too long though 
$C: This. Is. Genius. 
$C: that was intense for a 10 year old
$C: the letters are a courtesy thing.
$C: Can someone make this into a funny animation with sound?
$C: amazing
$C: This has any of the "Hitler in the Bunker" things beat all to shit 
$C: Awesome work! ThankYou!!
$C: Well jokes on him as you no longer need to buy gifts for your son!
$C: Why did I watch the whole thing?!
$C: I just need one simple answer. How does this get Gold? 10. fucking. times. Just how?
$C: This is beautiful and you should be proud of yourself OP
$C: This may be the greatest thing I’ve seen on reddit
$C: Best Christmas gif ever!!!
$C: That got really deep. 
$C: Fuckin'ell that was intense. 
$C: Is that the antagonist of Spiderman: Homecoming?
$C: Did I just watch a silent film?
$C: This is awesome!
$C: I want Jack to see this gif and i want to see his reaction. And then I want somebody to make a highquality gif of Jacks reaction.
$C: What was the original argument about? It seems just as powerful without the Santa topic.
$C: I would give gold, but 14 people have already done it for me. Thanks people!
$C: How fast do you people read? Some of those captions just flew by before I could even identify their colour.
$C: I--I have never seen so much gold in one place...
$C: So good
$C: What movie is this from?
$C: What the fuck
$C: TLDR
$C: Fuck that was amazing
$C: This is the first two minute gif I've ever watched all the way through. Good job, OP or whoever actually made it. :)
$C: This is... this literally made me want to cry.  My oldest figured out the whole Santa thing around age five, but never said anything because  he wanted to keep the secret for his younger brother.  He always gave us these sidelong glances and these sort of knowing little nods but it was not until his brother started asking that he let us know he had known for years. 
$C: When you stop believing in Santa, Santa stops believing in you. 
$C: This is great, but I feel it would have been better if it would have ended at "YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH".
$C: This was beautiful. Thank you. 
$C: Brilliant. Great writing scene for scene. 
$C: Fucking riveting. 
$C: 10 and 7? Isn't that a bit old for the santa story? Not old enough for make believe and such of course, but a bit old to seriously have the "is santa real" conversation IMHO.
$C: Marked. Funnyyyy
$C: Shit... dude... that was awesome!
$C: Cool gif but 14 GOLDS?!?? THE FUCK.


am i missin somethin here....
$C: I have never busted out laughing at a gif, but holy shit this one had me in tears. Amazing work!
$C: I started watching this gif when I came into work this morning. By the time it finished, it was time to go home.
$C: This is phenomenal 
$C: Explain why my mom bought me the GTA game on the GameBoy SP? 
And after knew the true... 

GTA on the Gameboy sucked ass. 
$C: Sub out 'Santa' for 'aliens' and this is pretty frighteningly accurate.
$C: oh...my....god.... my daughter is only 7 months old and now I am in terror of her growing up....
$C: I just started doing this dialogue by myself with the intent to create Toms and Jacks voices. Perfection! 
And that split second reaction at the end.... gold.
$C: This gif felt like a movie
$C: The loop is real
$C: Posts on /r/highqualitygifs gets 20k upvotes..... Posts on r/funny and gets 100k more.....
$C: Holy crap batman, that's folkingawesome!!
$C: This is wonderful. 
$C: Will I still enjoy this movie even though I have watched this scene before?
$C: The mouth movements don’t even match up with all the captions. Find a better video. 
$C: "Please , just go to bed now "  that was my favorite part.
$C: If I could only keep one saved post on Reddit, it would be this magical holiday gif. Thank you for this awesomeness. 
$C: This is a good reason why I'm still subscribed to /r/funny
$C: So problem with the argument...

Santa does see us when we are sleeping. Correct. But that doesn't tell him anything about what we want for Christmas because what he sees is sleeping boys and girls...

He knows when we are awake. Again correct. But this too doesn't tell him anything about what we want for Christmas because all he knows from this is that we are awake.

He knows when you've been bad or good. Correct. But this too doesn't tell him anything about what we want for Christmas because this is just knowledge of if when we've been bad or good.

Even if we accept that Santa sees everything we do (That was not the actual claim. He just knows if what we do is bad or good. But if we accept it as true) that still doesn't tell him ANYTHING about what you want for Christmas.

Say for instance you want a Skateboard for Christmas. This is presumably because you do not have a Skateboard. Not having a skateboard Santa of course would never see you riding a skateboard and enjoying it (unless you borrowed a friends). Not having seen you enjoy skateboarding there is nothing to tell Santa you might want a Skateboard.

So clearly if you want to Santa to know what you want for Christmas, you have to do SOMETHING for him to know. The accepted standard of practice for that SOMETHING is to either write a letter and ask your parents to mail that to the North Pole, or go to the Mall and tell him what you want for Christmas.

Now if you accept the argument that he knows everything you do, then of course you don't really have to mail the letter to the North Pole, because he would know what the letter says as soon as you write it... however he doesn't know everything you do. Just if what you do is bad or good.

By the way if you want something for Christmas it's polite (good) to ask for it, and not demand it. Demanding it would be bad. Thus writing a nice letter or going to see Santa at the mall while behaving is a simple way of earning a couple of extra good points.

Now I know, many movies show Santa having a detailed list of things kids have done throughout the year (IE: Little Jimmy pulled little Suzy's hair.) and sometimes he uses magic (or tech or magical tech) to review what someone has done. In some movies he even can recall such details on a whim without having to consult a list but this last part is the most unbelievable because the song clearly says he makes a list and checks it twice. We know for a FACT that Santa keeps a list and has need to check it more than once for errors. So he knows he might make a mistake, and tries to make sure that doesn't happen. And that's another reason we write to Santa. It's harder to make mistakes if you have something in writing.

This is also why you should give the letter to Santa to your parents and not just try to mail it to the north pole yourself. Good Parents will proof read your letter to make sure that Santa won't have any confusion with the letter, and will make sure it's addressed properly. Don't want it getting lost in the mail.
$C: Ia santa clause real? You're God damn right he is

$C: That was epic. Bravo!
$C: Bravo
$C: This is fucking brilliant. 
$C: This is magnificent. 
$C: Same logic can be applied to gods, yet people still believe in them!
$C: This is fantastic. Thank god I don’t have kids yet. 
$C: So what I get from this is, that santa IS real!!!
$C: I haven't actually seen this movie before so I have no reason to doubt that this is the real dialogue. 
$C: Bravo Romobyl, this was truly worthy of all of reddit's time.
$C: Shit, watching this high was so fucking intense, i was with full passion in that story
$C: I clicked onto this gif to look at the comments and when I clicked off it had 15k more upvotes and 3 more gildings.

This may turn out to be the top post of all time.
$C: When someone asks me what I remember most about 2017 I will regal them with the tale of this magical gif.
$C: when a gif needs a tl;dr
$C: Bravo
$C: Best post I've seen in months, good job!
$C: This is great! Bwahahaha
$C: Bravo! 
$C: Wait till he asks about the tooth fairy.

*You can't handle the tooth!*
$C: Santa claus was behind 9/11
$C: Damn that was a long one, worth it though!
$C: This is amazing
$C: So much gold!!! It's a Christmas miracle!
$C: Well that was quite a watch.
$C: Somehow. Someway. Someone get Tom and Jack to recreated this!
$C: One of the best gifs
$C: This is the funniest HQG I’ve ever seen. I’m a huge fan of the movie and could hear every word of the dialogue. Fantastic job!
$C: What an emotional roller coaster that gif was...
$C: Epic!!
$C: We will watch OP's career with great interest!
$C: This is brilliant 
$C: If god know everything, why pray?
$C: That was way too fucking long
$C: I know it'll never be seen, but this is one of the best things I've seen on Reddit this year. 
$C: Put this in the hall of fame. I have never seen 16 golds. 
$C: This is amazing. Well done to whoever put this together and thank you for sharing it. 
$C: Hey, this is pretty good.
$C: This needs awards. This was fantastic. The tension I felt was comparable to the actual movie. 
$C: Top Shelf. Like Applbee's current 1 dollar long islands.  Well done. 
$C: 15 gold? The fuk? 
$C: I had a similar conversation with my daughter last year. She was 10 then. And No, she did not want, and could not handle the "truth". She insists that Santa is real and any suggestion to the contrary would only bring a flood of tears. I am not ready for that.
$C: Awesome 
$C: Top notch, man. So good, and it's the truth. I've already had similar ones with my kids.
$C: This was awesome! More upvotes!!!
$C: Amazing. 
$C: Awesome, thanks
$C: Sometimes the internet just knocks it out of the park. This is one of those times. 
$C: That was one of the best things I have ever seen. Thank you.
$C: Fucking incredible. Perfection in he form of a gif congrats man you smashed this 
$C: fuckin 5 year olds and their know-it-all-ness
$C: Best thing I’ve seen in a long time.  Well done!
$C: Impressive.
$C: wow
$C: A gif masterclasses

$C: Best gif of all time
$C: I know I'm not the only one that heard Cruise's parts in a kid's voice.
$C: That went on for a while. 👏.
$C: this was amazing.
$C: Bravo! This is by far the best thing I've seen on Reddit all year
$C: There's still time to make top of 2017! YOU CAN DO THIS!
$C: Sleighin' the game right here.  Great work OP!
$C: Pretty sure most kids these days ask for a ps4 or a xbone
$C: Awesome
$C: Is a reddit miracle happening? Are we gonna break the Karma record?
$C: This might be the best thing I've ever seen on Reddit.  This made my day. 
$C: That was aweaome. New favorite gif.
$C: Amazing job HahaHaha 
$C: Am I allowed to FB this? Does it violate some rule/etiquette. I don't post often but this is perfect for my page.
$C: I love this. 
$C: Goddamit I missclicked and can start all over again 
$C: This is beautiful 
$C: It's for the aesthetic 
$C: I kid you not, me and a friend were just joking about santa claus not being real. Then I opened Reddit and see this!
$C: I feel really bad asking, what movie is this from? I don't know my movies
$C: This. Is. Soooooooo. Goooooodddddd
$C: This got 2000 more upvotes in the time it took to watch it.
$C: I was on the fence with believing in Santa, but now I'm back on board after watching this.
$C: Wow
$C: This was so dramatic and intense. 
$C: That was more entertaining than The Last Jedi.
$C: Santa is a pagan god that thrives on attention for power. Songs and decoration are just a part of it - the letters, cookies, and milk are a voluntary offering of your child's deepest desires which he feeds on to satiate his appetite.
$C: Time to go rethink my childhood 
$C: What movie is this? 
$C: What is this from really? I'd like to hear the real version. 
$C: Someone worked hard on this lol
$C: It is my deepest regret that I have but one upvote to give.
$C: This is fantastic. Great work!
$C: 16 gold, lord have mercy. 
$C: Can I get a transcript?
$C: This is so unbelievably well done.
$C: This might just be the greatest gif of all time..
$C: This is reddits finest hour. 
$C: Unbelievable job, best post I've seen in awhile lol
$C: He can see and know everything we do, but that does not mean he can read minds, now does it?
$C: tell him, santa may hear and see everything.  but he doesn't know your heart.
$C: r/gifsLongerThanLife ?...hilarious btw...well done.
$C: At some moments their mouths sync exactly to the words. Such satisfactions.
$C: This is the reason Reddit gold exists.
$C: Now we need one with "The Shining".
$C: It is weird when he calls him daddy. It doesn't feels right 
$C: A New Good Gif
$C: Bravo.
$C: Brilliance!!!
$C: That was amazing. The timing... Just everything. 
$C: Outstanding. 
$C: Look, the first time he asks "why do we have to write letters?" I would have said

"Because even though he knows, it's nice to get a letter. Just like grandma knows you are happy for your toys she got you, she likes getting a thank you note. And because she was nice enough to get it for you, you should send her the thank you note. You know I love you, but it's nice to hear me say it out loud to you. That's why you have to write a letter, because it's a small nice gesture to someone going through a lot of trouble to give you something nice." 
$C: Please make Tom Cruise stop calling him "Daddy"
$C: What a bunch of bullshit. 
$C: I would literally pay 50 dollars to see this scene reenacted with these new lines. It would be the greatest scene in film history. 
$C: Same argument can be made for JEBUS
$C: Lol 2 thumbs up
$C: This, right here, was quite possibly the best thing about my entire week. Most certainly my day. Thank you, OP.
$C: The list of most up voted posts 2017 was a little premature.
$C: This is priceless 
$C: So much gold
$C: This is a Christmas miracle!
$C: Comment for purpose.
$C: That is incredible. Well done.
$C: Was genuinely confused as to which film starred Tom Cruise prosecuting his father Jack Nicholson, took me about 30 seconds to find it weird after the second iteration of ‘daddy’. 
$C: I’m in a place with such low service the gif wont load yet I know what the content is based on the avatar and the time of year.
$C: That was the longest gif I've ever personally seen......but it was gold
$C: What movie is this from. I'm dumb
$C: Santa Claus can see what you do, but he can't read your mind. How would he know exactly what you want?

Witness was pathetically under-prepared.
$C: That is classic.

$C: I hope I can have this straight/serious intense face someday when my kid asks me if Santa is real. 
$C: the list becomes instructions for the elves, of course.
$C: GODDAMN RIGHT HE IS, CHILD!
$C: I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything with 16 gold
$C: I'm 15 (almost 16) and my parents still think I believe in Santa, and I keep hinting that I don't, and I'm not sure if they know that I know that they know that I don't believe in that fatass red dude. Like honestly wtf. I don't want to confirm it for them just yet because they seem like they enjoy it. Also my grandparents would freak.
$C: Long but good!
$C: Is it bad that it took me a while to realise that is actually NOT the real text in the movie..? I feel stupid now...
$C: Amazing gif, fantastic work.

I will never tell my children an outright lie. Not for convenience, not for their personal enjoyment, nor for the reasons listed in this gif.

I don't think people that do are bad parents and I completely understand the good reasons it is done, but I cannot bear to lie to my kids. My job as a parent is to prepare my kid for life as an adult and I inherently do not believe a "kid can grow up too fast". They can only not be prepared for the things they experience.
$C: Ridiculously long gif that was actually awesome and worth watching...
$C: best GIF i've seen in a long, long time
$C: I thought it was a video and the sound was off. Holy dick balls
$C: This is the most I've ever seen of this movie 
$C: Absolutely amazing. Very well done.
$C: Amazing, thanks.
$C: Easily the best thing I have seen on Reddit, ever.
$C: This is art.
$C: Is it bad that I really want them to get back together just to do this version of the scene?
$C: 16 gold wtf
$C: I was cackling like a witch because I couldn't stop laughing and control breathing at the same time. This is probably the best gif I've ever seen.
$C: Whew. That was intense.
$C: Never been so enraptured by a gif. Beautiful. 
$C: Imagine If Tom cruise and Jack Nicholson recreated this scene with this script this Saturday night on SNL. 
$C: Santa Clause clearly “makes a list and checks it twice”. why is this even an argument?
$C: Amazing 
$C: Bravo, best gif I've ever seen.
$C: I need an audio version of this. A full length gif is not enough to immerse myslef in it. I want someone to dub this with their voice. You could sound terrible but i'll still listen to it.
$C: bravo
$C: I think I’m gonna have to watch this on Christmas now. 
$C: Tfw a post gets more karma than you’ll ever get
$C: Holy crap that was funny.
$C: Haha mate this is amazing !
$C: > I'll have mommy confirm what you said

Holy shit this was the best part
$C: lol
$C: More gold stars on this post than on the general's chest.
$C: How does someone earn 25+ golds for a single gif.
$C: I am completely mind blown at this 
$C: A gif that keeps on giving. Thank you op. 
$C: Heh, all the smart kids I know play on Santa as long as possible.

"OK I want this and this from you and from *Santa* I want these things!"
$C: Beautiful.
$C: I couldn't hear a thing except when Jack said YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH.
$C: This went on for so long my phone shut off.
$C: this is awesome!! great work!
$C: So I guess I'm not the only one who watched it to the very last second.....

Awesome..

$C: THIS GUY REPOSTED FROM r/highqualitygifs !!!!!

Oh wait, it’s the same guy. Lul
$C: Why is this so popular? 140k updoots and 18 gold. Not hating, I think it’s a funny gif, but why is it so highly praised? I feel like I’m missing something.
$C: What's this movie called
$C: You’re definitely in the running for reddit post of the year
$C: my mom always told me: if Santa isn't real, and Santa brings half your gifts...

Santa was real for 5 more years after that.
$C: Yo. 
$C: Favorite gif of the year 
$C: that was beautiful, thank you
$C: If I had kids I’d tell them it’s because Santa is like me; he has to have everything written down or he’ll forget it! 
$C: Top of all time?
$C: 19 gold in five hours wtf
$C: Oh God all mighty 140k upvotes 
$C: 19x gold, is that a record?
$C: a masterpiece
$C: That was brilliant
$C: [r/highqualitygifs ](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/?st=JBED408J&sh=4d52951d) 
$C: When ur gettin upvotes like ur bashing Starwars Battlefront 2, u know ur shit is good.
$C: Epic!
$C: I never believed in Santa Claus, but I never admitted that to my parents because I was afraid that I would stop getting presents. Now I'm in my thirties and I still maintain the charade because it's the only thing I've ever known.
$C: Hahahaha!!! My kid exactly!!
$C: 19 fucking gold. I now give up.
$C: Omfg this is so good 
$C: My dad said that one year I wouldn't make a list or tell him what I wanted. All I would say is "Santa knows."
$C: I did not expect the feels that went with those laughs and I have no children.
$C: Transcription anyone?
$C: Wow that was amazing. Creativty off the chart. Enjoy your 20+ gold haha
$C: This is superb.
$C: I say, as soon as your kids start doubting or asking questions, just let them know he ain't real.
$C: Did I just watch a two minute gif and like it? Gah damn.
$C: In case you actually need an answer for him, you never said that Santa can see what's in his heart and mind so he needs to know what he wants!  Not everything has been said out loud.  

Alternatively, you could say he's supposed to write a nice letter to keep in touch rather than just a list of what he wants?  

Awesome gif, btw!
$C: Alright, who robbed who, r/HighQualityGifs or r/funny
$C: The gif that keeps on giving.
$C: That was incredible 
$C: Can someone post a mirror I still can't see it.. the play button does nothing
$C: Oh my ga! This has made my night!
$C: You are like the Judd Apatow of gifs, good but a little bit too long. 
$C: r/gifsthatkeepongiving
$C: 19 gold!?
$C: Goddamn this is great. I've never seen a few good me. But now I want to. 
$C: That was incredible
$C: 19 Gold.... Wtf?
$C: HOLY SHIT! 145k upvotes in 6 hours! Have an upvote just for that!
$C: Oh boy, now I'm seriously doubting tooth fairies! Lies all lies!!
$C: This is so intense it made my eyes wet. Damn ninjas cutting onions.
$C: r/gifsthatkeepongiving
$C: I actually believed this to be a real scene for a second there. 

Now THERE'S a Christmas flick Hollywood can make. 
$C: Easier answer: Because Santa likes to get letters and wants to hear from you, that's why. It's like eavesdropping vs. an actual conversation.
$C: This is got to be the most golds ever given to one post. This is an amazing piece here on multiple levels. Bravo
$C: That actually got sad at the end :-(
$C: Hands-down the best gif. Ever. 
$C: Mods can we get spoiler tag here, especially in comments.
$C: What's this? I'm crying? But I'm not laughing...

Very well done!
$C: No one on Reddit believes in santa
$C: Try saying that it is a means of being humble and polite that a truly good child would ask for what he wants instead of just expecting it.
$C: Um, he's making **a list** and checking it fucking twice. Get this amateur lawyer out of here
$C: I love this gif so much i want to have sex with it b
$C: Fuck! 19 Gold in 6 Hours! This has gotta be a legendary post on Reddit
$C: Which film is this from?
$C: 31 gold and counting...
$C: This is just brilliant. And he spoke the truth in the end. Santa is real! 
$C: He can't memorize every gift for every child in the world, that's why he needs those letters. 
Easy.
$C: I’m blown away by the amount of gold this dude has been given. Jfc
$C: "He needs letters for documentation"

In case anyone actually needed an answer for their kid. 
$C: This is amazing. 
$C: It’s hilarious that this was a repost and got 13 more gold than the original LOL 
$C: This is the Reddit I signed up for!
$C: One gif to rule them all
$C: Watch or even better read Hogfather. 
$C: Daddy? 😂
$C: I said he sees and hears everything, I didn't say he took notes! Now go to bed you little shit.
$C: A local lawyer was allegedly played by Tom Cruise in this movie. In reality, he was one of the attorneys on this exact case. But I don't think he had this exact exchange
$C: We write the letter because it’s polite. Old people like getting letters.
$C: Is there any way I can get the text for this gif? I was watching it for what felt like a long time but it still wasn’t over, and I accidentally refreshed the page and I really don’t want to sit through it all again. 
$C: Didn't know it was an actual NEW gif until it said Nintendo switch
$C: Awesome. 
$C: this is gonna be one of the most gilded posts 
$C: SPOILER ALERT!
$C: because he cant hear internalised thoughts so its a chance to ask for things they havent told anyone about
$C: I don't think my life can ever be complete if Jack Nicholson and Tom Cruise don't recreate this scene with this script.
$C: This is the type of content I wish /r/HighQualityGifs consistently upvoted. Instead it's just lame meta bullshit with those awful subtitle fonts and wacky transitions. Great job
$C: This is perfect 
$C: Dayuuuuum 20x gilded! Solid post!! 
$C: I would say Your ready for that conversation 
$C: This. Was. Amazing.
$C: Omg  this is epic
$C: Bravo
$C: Top 10 things i have seen on reddit.
$C: Santa clause actually works for the NSA


Edit: a letter 
$C: This is pure gold... if I had money to give gold I would. :( 
$C: This better stay top post all the way till next Christmas 
$C: Commenting for history 
$C: This was amazing! 
$C: Before you know it, your kids will reach that age where they enjoy going grocery shopping with their folks. 
$C: Am I the only one who finds it interesting  seeing a grown Tom Cruise calling Jack Nicholson Daddy?
$C: he knows what we do and say, but he doesn't know what we think. He needs us to actually say to him what we want (most people never verbally express their desires) and although he can hear it when you say what you want, he requires a letter because at heart Santa is a bureaucrat and he loves unnecessary paperwork.
$C: 27 gold stars so far between two subs. You deserve all of them.
$C: I was expecting something funny, but this got way too real and intrinsic for me.

I mean, haha yes.
$C: Fantastic
$C: Well, I made it about, half way through I'm guessing...
$C: This deserves all the gold it got and more
$C: Top Class. Top Class
$C: Did anyone else hear that?FUCK
$C: Can someone give me a  link for FB , this one does not work.
$C: Now I gotta watch this movie for the hundredth time
$C: This is fantastic. Thank you to all who participated in making me laugh for 5 minutes straight after watching.
$C: He needs the list to REMEMBER everything.
$C: Awesome
$C: "Because he wants a written record, for legal purposes."
$C: Santa comes on 6th of December not on christmas though.
$C: That was top quality, a new most "top of all time" post is on the horizon 
$C: What that sub for long gifs? 'Cause this should be at the top. 
$C: A good explanation for the letters is that though Santa knows your deepest and true desires, each kid should bear the fact that they asked for something that they want, something that is superficial, and through this Santa will bring them something to make them happy for a day, or a week, and let them understand that they cannot comprehend their deepest desires.
$C: This.was.excellent! You have my vote.
$C: This was hilarious!!! 
$C: Am now Santa for my young son and I feel the most excited for Christmas I've felt in years! 

Funny thing eh?
$C: I hate that Christmas song. My mom just sang it to my kids and it was the first time they had heard it and I really wish she hadn't. I want Santa to be a fun part of Christmas magic, not a creepy guy who watches everything you do, judging and withholding gifts from "bad" children. And kids are bad because they cry? Maybe I'm just a ridiculous millennial but I don't want to make my kids feel like showing emotions is a shameful thing.
$C: This is great and all that. But just because he can see and hear how you are behaving doesn’t necessarily mean he can know what you are thinking. So that’s why he needs the list.
$C: This isn't the absolute best but it is absolutely in the running for one of the...
$C: Sorry if I'm lame but what is the movie???
$C: Whats the original movie name?
$C: Is this gif the whole movie? Stopped watching a couple minutes in. 
$C: im on my phone so cant check but... how big if this freaking file?!? 
$C: This is the greatest thing ever. 
$C: The one mistake in this is the way you pluralised Lego.
$C: Am I the only one who read this in Tom Cruise an Jack Nicholson’s voice. 
$C: The perfect Christmas .gif doesn’t exsis—
$C: You are not keeping any magic if they already suspect. Time to grow up and make Christmas about family and food.
$C: That was magic, until he said "legos" and not "lego".

$C: Sure someone may know you in and out but just because they know you doesn't mean you give up conversing with them. If anything you converse more.
$C: I really hope seeing tom cruise calling jack Nicholson daddy doesn't awaken anything in me. 
$C: Oh my god the vid wont work is there a link?
$C: Love it!! They need to make this a movie. A Christmas movie...ahem...Netflix where you at?!?!
$C: I WANT TO BELIEVE 
$C: Wait, shouldn't that be "you're goddamn right he *isn't*"?  Cruise won that argument.
$C: Simple, he needs a letter because he's testing you. If you're going to take the effort and initiative to write to him listing what you desire, he's going to see it and know that's actually what you want, not a quick on-a-whim thought.
$C: What did it for me was the fact that the mouths did not fit the words, at all.  It's like watching a dubbed Chinese movie.
$C: You cant handle the pudding
$C: This is the best thing I have ever seen.
$C: when you have been browsing the internet and reddit for years, it is hard to find something interesting or genuinely funny anymore, but this, this is the best thing I have ever seen in a long time. NICE
$C: Please just go to bed now, lol!
$C: I never experienced a traumatic revelation of santas non-existence. My mom simply told me he isn't real and that they are the ones who buy the gifts and I was like "oh really? OK" 
$C: TLDW for a gif is impressive 
$C: My mom told me Santa was real but he died of old age. I accepted that.
$C: This is one of my favorite court room dramas and you nailed it man! One of the funniest things I've seen on this sub 
$C: https://media0.giphy.com/media/xT77XWum9yH7zNkFW0/200w.gif
$C: What is this scene from? I feel like I'm missing something.
$C: Why did this make me sad
$C: Best post I have seen yet 😂
$C: Genius!!
$C: This was powerful 
$C: U r god damn right ,sanata is real 
$C: The only correct response: Just because he hears what everyone says, doesn't mean he can memorize it all...that's why he makes the list, son.
$C: Could say the same thing about prayer I suppose.
$C: Dear god, Tom cruise was handsome. 
$C: So my internet wont load gifs because im visiting my parents, and it kills me that i cant watch something that got gilded 20 times:(
$C: I seriously died of laughter lol
This was phenomenal
$C: Most Gold I’ve ever seen on one post. Well deserved. 
$C: Top upvoted post of all time? I think we can get there. 
$C: This is the best thing I'm going to see. 
$C: What's this from? 
$C: This was beautiful, thanks op.
$C: r/noisygifs
$C: I like that version better than the original.
$C: Shut the sub down. It’s downhill from here. Go home, folks.
$C: Who believes in santa at age 10?  I think the word was out on the playground by age 6 or 7.

Incredible work though.
$C: Got me right in the parenthood. 
$C: Still waiting for Mommy to confirm
$C: I would like to see Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson re-enact this with this exact script.  Great writing and it would be an amazing skit.  How the hell do we make this happen??
$C: I sush’d my wife to complete this. 

That was a huge mistake. 




Worth it. 
$C: Santa knows what you do or say but not think. Come on. Easy.
$C: I wonder what it must feel like to have created a gif that will be reposted for the foreseeable future. Like, instant reddit classic.
$C: I like this
$C: I'll be the buzzkill but the logic doesn't follow. If you know all the things I do you still wouldn't know exactly what my mind wants, therefore lists are necessary. 
$C: Might be the single greatest holiday-related post I've seen on Reddit. Ever. 
$C: Congrats on the 31 reddit golds you have 
$C: Enjoy your gold for the next two years!
$C: Why 20 gold tho 
$C: Twenty. Fucking. Golds. I've seen it all, boys and girls. I've seen it all...
$C: Already 7th of all time on Reddit
$C: To be quite honest, the fact this is getting so much gold here, let alone other subreddits, is kind of sickening. Good on you, OP.
$C: Omg we need these two (and the third) to voice these lines.
$C: Because, son. Being grateful is a learned skill and Santa genuinely appreciates the time and effort  every boy and girl puts into their letters to him. He certainly knows what you want, but are you sure you do? Even daddy has to wonder sometimes if he's really sure of what he wants, it helps daddy out a lot to write out his thoughts and imagine the toys he wants.

Yes, son, daddy gets toys, too. How do you think we had that Wiiu and your favorite games? Now go write your letter to Santa, I'm sure he can't wait.
$C: Its for the elves
$C: This is fucking stunning. 
$C: This is the best gif ever
$C: Holy shit I've got tears rolling down my face. That was amazing. Thank you for the laugh!!!!!!!
$C: This works for god too. But I wouldn't lie to my kids or have kids either tbh 
$C: This is a goddamn triumph.
$C: This is the best thing ever. I was sitting there in anticipation of the progressing story the entire time!
$C: I am so glad I clicked on this
$C: This is the best thing I have ever seen!
$C: I need the full transcript of this, please. 
$C: Shame gold ain’t bitcoin, you’d have $342k now. 
$C: Wish i had this convo, never had one w my dad, its not that he’s dead, its just that we dont along for 24 years now
$C: This is the most upvoted comment of 2017
$C: This was amazing
$C: This is very funny. :)
$C: Longer than I was expecting
$C: The plural form of Lego shouldn't end with an S.
$C: That was so incredibly brilliant. I love you:
$C: [Santy Claus only brings presents to them that's been good all year. All the other ones, all the naughty ones, he punishes! What about you, boy? You been good all year?](https://youtu.be/RsxPi8Vcttk)
$C: So this is the “you can’t handle the truth”! What movie is this?
$C: Best gif of all time!!
$C: Take all these upvotes.
$C: "Because Santa cant read minds, he dosnt know if you suddendly changed your mind about what you want or if you want something more you havent mentioned"


BOOM!


Btw yes, im a dad
$C: My son aborted when I got to the "depends what you mean by real" part of the conversation.  I think he worried that too much knowledge might affect the present count.  


$C: This can all be solved by saying he can, that way the kids behave because they never know that Santa is or isn't watching and he still needs the notes as a reminder of what they want
$C: This is simply genius. 
$C: Someone needs to make a version with scenes from Malice. 
$C: This was the greatest GIF I’ve ever seen. This was so well done and matched so well I had to watch again to really read it because I was laughing and missing other lines. 

Well done, whoever you are. I’m hoping I only upvote the creator, and not someone who stole this. 
$C: so true
$C: If you think about it, this is a really good analogy to what he is actually saying on the movie... Good analysis too. #filmstudent
$C: WTF, all of a sudden 22 golds?
$C: Ahhh man... This got to me. My 9 year old is asking a lot of questions and I think this is the last year. But, I'm gonna make like Nicholson in this GIF and stick to my guns til the end! 
$C: GOAT
$C: I don't know why I was starting to cry watching this..... I get overly emotional sometimes...
$C: Easily the greatest Christmas gif ever.
$C: What is the movie called?
$C: Santa has *millions upon millions* of kids he has to get to.... do you think that he can remember everything that each one of them wants? is how I would have responded....
$C: 33 gold SHIIIII
$C: **INTENSE**
$C: Dammit it went by too fast. 
$C: this is fantastic
$C: This was epic.
$C: Wow, 22 gildings in one day! Well earned!
$C: santa is omnipotent but aging and his memory isn't what it used to be.  elves compile a surveillance dossier on your activities, but it's more work than is necessary trying to figure out what you'd want from that
$C: This is the best gif I’ve ever seen.
$C: I will never get why people lie about Santa to there children....It's the most selfish thing you can possibly do.



$C: 😆😅😂🤣
$C: Wow, this was awesome
$C: I hated the Santa b.s. but I kept it going because I didn't want my parents to know I knew.  

One day after I tired of horse and pony show I went up to them and said, "that Santa thing, I know."
$C: Jesus Christ, 180k upvotes and **twenty two** gold as of this post.
$C: 183k... The karma is real.
$C: Awesome 
$C: Is this a gold record?
$C: Fittoo
$C: why am i crying?
$C: Isn't the simple answer that santa can't read minds...? 
$C: Can any of you upload the gif to somewhere else? Possibly giffycat cuz imgur is banned in my country and i cant watch it :c
$C: Brb memorising these lines
$C: QUALITYYYYY
$C: We need Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson reeact this on SNL.
$C: 22 fucking gildings?  Jesus christ, OP.  Well done.
$C: i am happy to see an OP getting the credit it deserves.  
$C: “...the official Star Wars blanket I bought for you last Christmas”

That got me.
$C: I came three times while watching this 
$C: It took me longer than I should admit to realize the words were not the same as the people... the first daddy should have tipped me off. I just thought it was some new weird christmas movie.
$C: This is the best thing on the internet
$C: 22 gold is too much
$C: I love this gif. Fuckin A santa is real, that jolly son of a bitch. 
$C: I love this.
$C: 22 golds?!?!?!?!
$C: Santa confirmed working with Amazon Prime Now from 2019!
$C: This is fucking amazing.  Well deserved karma
$C: this is one of the funniest things i have seen all year
$C: 2017. The first time I bursted into laughter at my phone in a quiet, public place. Though I was also in a public place when Chester B. committed suicide, but yelling out "oh shit no way!?" At your phone is somehow less attention grabbing.
$C: My oldest boy is nine. He still believed in everything, but the questions were becoming more frequent. His thoughts more analytical. 

Me and the wife learned about the latest parent trick about welcoming him into the world of "Santa" as a way to break it to him. That we all were Santa, and he gets to be one too. 

All in all it has worked out. He has been doing a great job with his younger siblings, even saving our ass when the Elf didn't move overnight. 

But I felt like shit that night, sitting in McD's telling him. I felt like I was snuffing out some of his innocence. A couple days after he had a meltdown, and I could hear him sobbing to his mom that he felt like all the magic in the world had gone away. 

Fuck...I have never felt so sad and regretful. 
$C: This is some SNL skit level writing...send this to SNL lol.
$C: This fuking great, thank you.
$C: This is so well done
$C: Post to r/highqualitygifs!
$C: Bravo
$C: This is absolutely amazing 
$C: *Because Santa's is very old like grandpa.  He can tell you what he had for lunch on the third tuesday of February during the great depression but can't remember to wipe his ass after taking a shit.  Plus he is a needy son of a bitch.*
$C: Brilliant. 
$C: This is hilarious! I could hear Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson's voice in my head.
$C: I don't think I've ever seen more gold on a post. Hats off to you
$C: This movie will never be the same, I will always remember the Santa version.
$C: Is this the most gold a post has ever received? Currently at 22.
$C: How old was everyone when they learned Santa wasn't real. Unfortunately I was 12. not proud of that. 
$C: What a great conversation about Santa and the Christmas eve. We need Santa everywhere. 
$C: Toasting in epic 🍞!
$C: It felt like I was watching an actual movie for a second until it repeated and I remembered it was a GIF with added subtitles.
$C: Never seen that many upvotes. Never seen that many golds. Nice. 
$C: one of the best gifs I have ever seen.
$C: Genius 
$C: My mind = blown
$C: Lmao! Best thing i've seen in days
$C: Whoa. What a ride!
$C: Incredible, just incredible. 
$C: Wow that was awesome.
$C: what the hell is this, did you turn an entire movie into a gif?
$C: I’ve never seen a gif obtain that much gold. It was well deserved. I nominate this gif for an Oscar too. Well performed. 
$C: Hah. One day I hope to never have to. But I'm sure I will.
$C: Take my up vote! This was awesome.  Was on the edge of my seat the whole time
$C: He's "making a list." And refers to the childs letters when he "checking it twice"
$C: Long.

Great.
$C: One of my friends believed in Santa until she was in her early teens. Her older brother told her one year as he was putting up lights that if Santa finds out you don’t believe in him he makes you do stuff like put up the lights for Christmas and that the real reason we put up lights is because the more lights you put up the sooner you can get back on the nice list. Santa wants to make sure you’ve been doing your work as he’s flying in the sky. She genuinely thought that the people who live in houses with a lot of lights were assholes.
$C: Reminds me of the conversation me and my 6 year old had about god.  

**Son:** Daddy, is god real? 

**Me:** The concept of god is made up for people to feel like there is something more to life, or a meaningless existence. He's something people need to believe in, just like kids believe in Santa Claus. 

**Son:** Wait, Santa Claus isn't real? 

**Me:** Oh shit. 
$C: I mean I was never very vocal about what I wanted from Santa as a kid. I wanted to ensure that I did not get duplicate gifts. Some years I was very careful to make sure that the only way to know what I wanted from Santa was to read the letter. 
$C: Amazing
$C: !RedditSilver
$C: I'm tripping on mushrooms right now and this was the best thing ever. Thank you reddit. Thank you to the person who made this. 
$C: * sits in corner playing with dreidel
$C: Truly EPIC
$C: I was wavering with having faith in Santa, however now I'm back on board in the wake of watching this.
$C: next generation santa grow up
$C: Literally the best thing I’ve seen this Christmas. And that includes my mrs in her naughty mrs Santa outfit. Bravo. 
$C: All this karma gives me a softie. 
$C: I couldn't stop watching...
$C: You still could’ve used the line “You snot nosed little bastard” and it would’ve been like something my dad would’ve said to me.
$C: Gf and I have decided not to bother lying to our kids about Santa. Personally don't see the point. We'll ask them not to ruin it for others, though. 
$C: Reddit Pro forever.
$C: So good
$C: What movie is this? 
$C: Got real pretty quick. I'm 24 and waant Santa to be real :(
$C: I love the idea of Tom Cruise calling Jack Nicholson daddy. XD
$C: Tom Cruise's "acting skills" are way below par. Eli5 how he got famous
$C: Movie name? Looks so tense and awesome
$C: Bravo
$C: What a rollercoaster of emotion!
$C: Tell him santa is stickler to the rules a mail means gift. he might hear but he likes receiving letters. i can read books on a kindle but i prefer the feel of the paper on my hands 
$C: Guess who won't be getting any presents
$C: Is that a gif or a video? 
$C: Is it weird  I automatically heard the younger guys voice in an Australian accent? 😂

$C: 10 years old and still believes in Santa? That's one gullible kid...
$C: This is pure genius. Thank you for the great laugh I had :D
$C: Just go to bed

Judge : why isn't he in bed yet?
God i lost it at that.
$C: This is soo good !
$C: Now this will be a classic like home alone movies
$C: /r/HighestQualityGifs 
$C: I love this, this is exactly how my son reacts to anything i say!
$C: This is adorable but it’s also why I don’t like the idea of elf on the shelf. It ruins the Christmas magic a little to fast. 
$C: Official requests must be submitted in writing.
$C: You sure have grown an awful lot this year. Not only are you taller, but I can see that your heart has grown, too. (Point out 2-3 examples of empathetic behavior, consideration of people’s feelings, good deeds etc, the kid has done in the past year). In fact, your heart has grown so much that I think you are ready to become a Santa Claus.

You probably have noticed that most of the Santas you see are people dressed up like him. Some of your friends might have even told you that there is no Santa. A lot of children think that, because they aren’t ready to BE a Santa yet, but YOU ARE.

Tell me the best things about Santa. What does Santa get for all of his trouble? (lead the kid from ‘cookies’ to the good feeling of having done something for someone else). Well, now YOU are ready to do your first job as a Santa!

The child then chooses someone they know and must secretly find out what that person needs for Christmas. They then provide it, wrap it and deliver it, while never revealing to the person where that gift came from.
$C: Is it "good" to teach children that Santa is real? Aren't you just lying to your kids and taking advantage of their trust in you? Full disclosure, I do not have kids.
$C: This is the single greatest use of this clip I have ever seen.
$C: This. This right here is the epitome of good content. Notice that the top post of all time follows this theme.
$C: What about the dog? He was at the meeting too!
$C: It’s “LEGO” for fucks sake. How hard is it cunts?
$C: She does better research and reporting than the mainstream media. Nicely done. 
$C: Good for her. When I was a kid, I just looked up "Santa Claus" in the set of encyclopedias my dad had bought for us that year.
$C: He hears you, and sees you...but he doesn't read your mind.  Now go to bed.
$C: That was intense
$C: That elf showed amazing resolve, willing to sacrifice treats and indeed life and limb to protect its secrets. We can use a good elf like that. 
$C: Just brilliant!

$C: Now talk to her about everyone’s best friend Jesus. See what conclusion she comes to...
$C: Are you sure this isn’t r/nosleep ?
$C: Hate to be that guy but, sauce?
$C: Protip: if it's >10 seconds long, it should be a fucking video and not a gif
$C: For a second there I thought someone else reposted your Gif and got more than twice the gold you did on HQG.
$C: This gave me quite a cackle 
$C: I would vote for her to be my president right now. 
$C: Fantastic. A+ to the creator of this.
$C: That's some grade A science right there. Kudos to her.
$C: Ah yes, the Elf on the shelf. The favored tool of the Kim IL Santa regime.
$C: What movie is this?
$C: This is the greatest Christmas gift you could have given me. 
$C: I knew it was over because Jack was calm suddenly. 
$C: PLEASE, post this to HQG. it's awesome!
$C: Epic video
$C: Hot damn, there is a lot of karma over here.
$C: You didnt notice pipe cleaner handcuffs? 

$C: What's her scientific stance on God?
$C: The gif that keeps on giving
$C: Hey
$C: [Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus](http://www.nysun.com/editorials/yes-virginia/68502/) (1897)
$C: Convinced me!
$C: "you're god damned right he's not!"

for continuity issues. in the movie he's asking if he ordered the code red, after presenting evidence that he did, and gets the response "you're god damned right i did." in the gif he's asking if santa clause is real, after presenting evidence that he is not. the answer should be "you god damn right he isn't" or something. just a thought. carry on.
$C: LEGO is the plural of LEGO.


$C: This was the best one of these I've ever seen, so we'll written as well.
$C: Oh my god this is the greatest thing I've seen in a long time

$C: This is the most I've ever seen of this movie 
$C: #4 on r/all, pretty good
$C: History 
$C: Future meta
$C: ‌2 b‌hitc‌oins thats ‌yall I want ‌2 f‌0r christmas ‌naha :D
$C: I read through quite a few comments and I'm surprised no one pointed out how this conversation alludes to God (which is defined differently by different people, such as the one at the end of the gif). Very well done, whether intended or not. 
$C: Santa Claus is a massive fraud against all childs, they should start a class actions against it
$C: Oh shit, this is literally amazing!! 
$C: 200000 likes in 4 days. I'm usually happy to get 2 likes in 4 days
$C: This is wonderful. 
$C: This is amazing. Thank you.
$C: 23 gold?! But you know what, it's well deserved 
$C: I can hear voices while watching this video.....
$C: I really hope seeing tom cruise calling jack Nicholson daddy doesn't awaken anything in me. 
$C: Gilded 23 times. :o
$C: Well that was an emotional rollercoaster.
$C: Knew what was going to happen. Still watched the whole thing. Was not disappointed.

$C: r/GIFBLR
$C: RemindMe! 360 days "Repost!"
$C: Ok that's the longest gif I ever watched. And I'm gonna watch it again.
$C: Such as classic, I love Saving Private Ryan
$C: Santa needs me to write the letter because he is to busy listening and watching to write it down him self.
Then he gives the letters to the elves and they make my presents. 
$C: Halfway into this gif, I realized that isn’t what they’re really saying
$C: This dude got enough gold for 2 years 
$C: Perfect loop with the captions. I didn't think it had ended yet for a moment.

/r/GifsThatEndPerfectly 
$C: What's so bad about the kids knowing who gave them the presents?
$C: what's this from?
$C: Best Christmas video I have ever seen
$C: This is brilliant!!!
$C: RemindMe! 11 months
$C: **THIS IS THE FUNNIEST SHIT I HAVE EVER WATCHED**
$C: That's a long ass Gif
$C: My god.. I just started laughing so hard at work, and I work at a call center. 
$C: u/dsiddarth
$C: This is missing that one more gold to make it a perfect 24
$C: Wow. So I'm going to reconsider letting my future kids that I don't have yet in on the Santa thing, and  Easter Bunny, and all that other bs.
$C: "Santa is a busy man and can't remember everything every kid in the world tells him, so he uses the lists as a reference sheet"
$C: The logic is flawed. Santa sees and hears all. Yes! However, it doesn't necessarily follow that he therefore knows what you want for Christmas.

Jack Nicholson should be ashamed of himself for breaking under such a sloppy interrogation!
$C: /u/minnestralia
$C: This made me cry
$C: RemindMe! 10 months "repost this next December"
$C: This gif is evergreen.
$C: That was excellent.
$C: downvoted for "legos"
$C: This is amazing
$C: Just because he sees and hears you, does not mean he remembers you.
$C: Somebody put in a lot of effort in making this.
$C: 72 days later, still a gem.
$C: This is a repost from like two months ago
$C: This is the cutest thing ever~
$C: That's god damned genius 
$C: Woah 
$C: I like this 
$C: This is the best thing I've ever seen. 
$C: Tldr; dad tells son that Santa isn't real.
$C: This is the best Christmas gif I've ever seen
$C: I prefer dubbed.
$C: 3 months late to the party, but this would be a great skit.
$C: Santa's not God. He may see and hear all you say, but he doesn't know what you're thinking. Using speech and facial expressions may very well just be a lie.
$C: Me and my Dad with God
$C: Just because he knows everything you say doesn't mean he remembers it.
$C: "I WANT THE TRUTH" made me laugh 
$C: Applause 👏 
$C: So he can remember
$C: I hope this won a gif competition 
$C: That's spectacular. Bravo!
$C: That was much longer than I initially anticipated.
$C: I like that my parents didn’t do Santa because I want to thank them not Santa, I know it’s an unpopular opinion 
$C: This is absolutely my favorite GIF that I've ever seen.
$C: I feel weird saying Tom Cruise is my crush, but by heavens I didn't think to check that he was this hot when he was younger 
$C: Which movie is this from?
$C: 23 gold... wow...
$C: It's this OC? Take it to the top!
$C: Holy fuck with the 3 minutes, bravo.
$C: I Love this scene and this was done superbly well!!
$C: r/highqualitygifs
$C: This is a masterpiece, all you other giffers just give up.
$C: Well fucking done. 
$C: I was cracking up, then you closed with a nut kick to the feels. Well done.
$C: Bravo. 
$C: I love the ending
$C: This is not funny at all. 

Why do we keep talking aboit some fat guy invented by coca cola, anyway?
$C: /r/gifsthataretoolong
$C: I know a Mom who told her son at age 3 there was no Santa, no tooth fairy either. They don't celebrate Christmas. 100% Atheist. Most whacked out, messed up family I've ever seen.  Go with it until the kids are old enough to figure it out. Judeo Christian value system works best in America.
$C: The list is for the elves, not Santa. 
$C: I'm a bit disappointed by the last line being pro-Claus. The last line is supposed to go against everything he's said up to that point.
$C: I remember a lot of things from when I was very young, but I never remember believing in this Santa Claus thing.
$C: Nintendo Switch. Thanks Santa, I'll gently go take my nap now. 
$C: This made me smile, thank you.
$C: When a GIF is so amazing you to have to share it with everyone you know. 
$C: Whew!  At first this was just a goofy parody, but then...before I even knew it,  it hit me right in the feels.  Oof!

Well done gif, OP/author!
$C: this was too long and I just couldn't stop until it finished.  worth it.  would recommend.  
$C: I'm still confused as to what this movie's plot is since I don't get army stuff....could someone please explain it to me? 

I get that it's about a court case.
$C: That was amazing, only gripe was the "legos", [LEGO isn't pluralised despite Americans doing it so often.](http://www.adrants.com/images/lego_sorry.gif)
$C: You're going to explain the need for a wall?
$C: What movie is this?
$C: OMFG FUNNIEST FUCKING THING IN THE HISTORY OF COMEDY OMFG 50 FUCKING GOLD STARS LOOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
$C: I feel the same way about prayer.
$C: If you look closely, you can see the words don't match the subtitles. I think this just might be, as the kids say, fake news.
$C: This is retarded
$C: Way too fucking long. It’s not even worth watching the whole way through. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: That's amazing
$C: This was amazing. Well done sir
$C: That was absolutely beautiful and I couldn't stop watching. BRAVO.
$C: Ok sure, Santa can be the one who fills the stockings. But to hell with him if he thinks he's taking credit for the Nintendo Switch that I worked so hard to provide for the kids I don't have!
$C: I needed this today, thank you.
$C: This is brilliant. Thank you for this awesomeness
$C: Holy crap right at the end of the year we get this amazing masterpiece, well done , well fucking done.

$C: So good. 
$C: Masterful 
$C: This is supposed to be funny. Why am I tearing up?
$C: This is my favorite thing today.
$C: As a father myself, I can really appreciate this.


The dialogue is very well done!
$C: What movie is this from 
$C: *standing ovation*
$C: I knew where it was going yet was still hooked. Bravo!
$C: Simply amazing! 
$C: That's one long ass gif, but pretty well done. I salute you, good sir. Have a Merry Christmas
$C: Was about to call OP out for stealing from r/HighQualityGifs, then noticed it's the same OP.

Well done sir/maam, take my upvote a second time.
$C: At first it was all about the LOL's then it became the fEEEEEEEEEElllls. 10/10

$C: That was pretty fucking good.  I read it in the way they say it in the movie.  Great job.
$C: Watched it twice already
$C: Wow this brought out feelings I didn't know I had
$C: This is brilliant - love it.
$C: This is the greatest.

$C: Wow. That cut close to home real fast.
$C: Slow clap
$C: holy shit this is so good

$C: I think if kids are taught the value of things from an early age and not fed lies they'd be more likely to gain an early(er) appreciation for the value of the things they ask for.  
$C: Best fucking gif ever. 
$C: Best thing I've seen today 
$C: That was a ride. 
$C: holy shit this was amazing.
$C: Lol lol lol 🤡
$C: Love the build up. expected it to get to the "you can't handle the truth!" part much sooner and to stop afterwords. well done. 11/10
$C: This is perfection beyond words and a masterpiece to be appreciated for all time.  I mean holy shit this was amazing.  
$C: You are a beautiful person for sharing this with us.

Thank you. 
$C: Possibly the Scrooge in me, but I can’t help but seeing that this dub over magical style of post being adopted and perverted by commercial marketing firms as another form of advertising. 

This is not a knock, but rather high praise for OPs post. It is just that it might be too good. Well done OP. Well done. 
$C: <slow clap>

$C: Wow this is well done.
$C: just amazing
$C: This is probably the best .GIF I will ever have the pleasure of viewing. I can't get Tom Cruise calling Jack Nickolson Daddy out of my brain though. There's probably already a subreddit for that. 
$C: This is going into reddit's upvote hall of fame boys! 
$C: This was the highlight of my day. Thanks for that.
$C: Well done. This made my day.
$C: You put a lot of work into that. Wow! 
$C: i love this so much! 
$C: I'm giving you mental gold.  Use it for good my friend 
$C: This is brilliant. 
$C: This is not 3 minutes worthy. It's a fucking silent film 
$C: This shit is awesome. 
$C: 22 gold...hmmmm. If i repost this,will i become reddit rich as well? Its obviously just a scientific question
$C: 200k upvotes for this shit. God damn 
$C: Leaving this comment as proof I was here.
$C: This was good, but I'm not sure that it's 3 minutes good.
$C: Ok I get the GIF is great and all but HOW THE FUCK DOES IT HAVE 22 GOLD?
$C: It's just good manners, that's why.
$C: Too long.. ruined it.
$C: Best thing I've seen this year. Easily!
$C: Killed me. Dead
$C: Sorkin could not have e done it better. Great work.
$C: Welp, I'll never watch that scene again without thinking of this. 
$C: This was deep. I felt every word. Every. Word.

Fux. I'm showing this to all the homies. 
$C: Bravo. This is the most entertaining gif I've ever seen
$C: Ok this wins Reddit post and gif of the year. 
$C: This is brilliant. 
$C: This is Amazing! It fits beautifully. 
$C: This is truly incredible!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!  How long does it take to put this together?  It's amazing.  Just shared with my wife... definitely spouse worthy.
$C: This is amazing!!!
Thank you for this!
$C: This might be the greatest thing I’ve ever seen
$C: Swear to god...that was precious.
$C: FUCK yes! 
$C: That was fucking amazing.
$C: This is soooooo good!! 
$C: I'm sorry, but this is the greatest thing I've ever seen posted on this sub. 
$C: This is the best gif I’ve ever seen 
$C: Absolutely brilliantly done.
$C: This maybe the single greatest thing I've ever seen on reddit!
$C: Fucking brilliant. Well done. 
$C: A-Fucking-Mazimg
$C: Absolutely brilliant!!! 😂
$C: Very well done
$C: Pure gold.
$C: That was glorious
$C: Best fucking thing I've seen in awhile.
$C: /r/highqualitygifs
$C: This is the best post of 2017, easily.

edit: Oh, alright then.
$C: Stolen. Shame on you.
$C: I know this will get downvoted by all of the Santa loving Americans who bought in Coca Cola's stupid advertising character... But the size of the Santa myth is fucking stupid and I think it's stupid to tell our kids that some magic dude, who is a bastardized version of Saint Nicholas made by Coca Cola, is going to come down your chimney and give you presents if you're good. America's obsession with Santa Claus is so over the top. How do you explain to little Jimmy that he got an Xbox and new bike from santa while Clara down the street only got socks from Santa, because her family is poor? 
$C: Surprise ending
$C: Dude, all that gold around Christmas, someone gonna think you robbed a Hannukah party. 
$C: Someone could just replace Santa with God and writing letters with prayer.
$C: Nice steal from r/highqualitygifs 
$C: Yeah this is cute and all... but I have never lied to my kids about this. They know Santa is a made up thing like Luke Skywalker or Captain America, but it’s still something they can enjoy and have fun with without their parents lying to them about it. I just don’t believe in lying to my children unless absolutely necessary. 

On top of that, it doesn’t teach them to be grateful (a big thing most kids lack). Those presents didn’t just come from some magic man, mommy and daddy worked hard and put in overtime to buy you that gift. You’re not **entitled** to it, it was a **gift** from someone who loves you. Not saying the lie of Santa is the reason we have so many entitled people these days but it sure doesn’t help.
$C: This is the reason I can't explain reddit to my friends. They would never appreciate the awesomeness of this because it's not on FB.
$C: THIS IS AMAZING! WELL DONE, BRAVO!
$C: I don't understand the issue other parents have with this...  

I told my kids that Santa is pretend, but it's fun to pretend so we go along with it.  She still gets into it because she's a kid and very excitable, and there's no secret to keep. win-win.

Do we go around telling the kids that Dora The Explorer or Mickey Mouse aren't real mutants?  No.  So why do we treat Santa any differently?
$C: Lets all lie to our kids!
$C: It's Lego. Not legos
$C: This is why the internet exists. Thanks everyone, we can all go home now. 
$C: Can someone explain to me why you would willingly tell your children something other than you basically brought them gifts opposed to explaining to them that you worked for them and you the parent is the one who provided them with the gifts. Very weird to me 
$C: never gas a gif touched me so much and made me laugh at the same. serious props to the creator. 
$C: Love this.
$C: This is excellent.

$C: what a wild ride
$C: This was purely awesome.
$C: Oh man this gif  was so well made.  i was immersed  right to the end!
$C: This is really some very good work!
$C: This is beautiful!
$C: This is the longest gif I have ever watched and I usually scroll away after a few seconds. 10/10 would recommend. 
$C: I want the transcript.
$C: This is comedy gold. 
$C: Sooooo much tension. Loved it!
$C: I think this is the best thing I've seen all day...lol
$C: Why has this gif not single handedly broken the internet?!?!?!?! INCREDIBLE!!
$C: This is possibly the greatest Christmas gift any of us will receive this year. 
$C: Holy shit I'm crying 
$C: That was a lot more emotional than I was ready for
$C: I'm commenting just in case this become one of the top upvoted comments on reddit. I want my spot in the limelight. 
$C: Probably the longest GIF (pronounced “JIFF”) I’ve ever watched. 
$C: TL;DW PLEASE??!
$C: Why do religious people pray? 
$C: What incredibly selfish reasoning. Lying to your children for no reason is a shitty thing to do; plain and simple.

Instead of making up a fake magical man for kicks, how about you tell them the truth so that they know who to actually appreciate for what they receive, and learn about how they got them so they have something to think about and don't fall into a rhythm of believing lies.

This has nothing to so with keeping your kids happy, it's a selfish fantasy that you indulge in because, heaven forbid, you're not ready for them to grow up. Reddit has no problem yelling at people for believing in God, but a fat German wizard? Sign us up!
$C: Santa: A Ridiculous Capitalist Myth

It amazes me that so many allegedly "educated" people have fallen so quickly and so hard for a fraudulent fabrication of such laughable proportions. The very idea that santa happens to come to our house, showing itself in neat, 1-year cycles -- with the same amount of presents all the time -- is ludicrous. Furthermore, it is an insult to common sense and a damnable affront to intellectual honesty and integrity. That people actually believe it is evidence that the capitalists have wrested the last vestiges of control of our public school system from decent, God-fearing Americans (as if any further evidence was needed! Daddy's Roommate? God Almighty!)

Documentaries such as Enemy of the State have accurately portrayed the elaborate, byzantine network of surveillance satellites that the capitalists have sent into space to spy on law-abiding Americans. Equipped with technology developed by Amazon Inc., these satellites have the ability to detect children from hundreds of kilometers up. That's right, neighbors .. the next time you're out in the backyard exercising your gift giving rights, the capitalists will see it! These satellites are sensitive enough to tell the difference between an Xbox and a ps4! And when they detect you with a gift, their computers cross-reference the address to figure out your name, and then an enormous database housed at Berkeley is updated with information about you.

Of course, this all works fine during the day, but what about at night? Even the capitalists can't control the rotation of the Earth to prevent nightfall from setting in (only Joshua was able to ask for that particular favor!) That's where "santas workshop" comes in. Powered by nuclear reactors, "Santa's workshop" is nothing more than an enormous balloon, emitting trillions of dollars of presents. Piloted by key members of the capitalist community,, "santa" is strategically moved across the country, pointing out those who dare to make use of their God-given rights at night!

Yes, I know this probably sounds paranoid and preposterous, but consider this. Despite what the revisionist historians tell you, there is no mention of "santa" anywhere in literature or historical documents -- anywhere -- before 1950. That is when it was initially launched. When President Josef Kennedy, at the State of the Union address, proclaimed "Santa is real", he may as well have said "the tooth fairy is real." The subsequent faking of a "santa" visits on national TV was the first step in a long history of the erosion of our constitutional rights by capitalists in this country. No longer can we hide from our government when christmas happens.
$C: Downvoted for how long and in-concise this was 
$C: [deleted]
$C: 1st gif ever that was
/TLDF
Too Long Didn't Finish

Great Quality and funny though

$C: Same exact thing can be said about religion.

"If God sees everything, then why do we need to pray?" 
$C: damn, never yawned during a gif before
$C: Just tell him the truth. Lying to your kid for years on end doesn't go unnoticed.
$C: Why do people still lie to their kids over this? I just become a father, and I really want to understand the rational.
$C: somehow people think this is funny
$C: as a new father to an infant, I'm going to do everything in my power to prevent christmas.  

ohhhhhhh but 06extn you're denying all the fun and magic of the season!

BULLSHIT.  it's all BULLSHIT.  My father died a week before christmas when I was 16.  my step daughter didn't come home last christmas morning and we only found out she didn't plan to come back and was living with dad when we texted her. 

you want a magical world where a fatass in red pajamas brings you things you ask for but probably don't deserve and we defintely can't afford?  take some PCP and imagine that shit.  Otherwise, get with the times and realize it's all about buying more shit we don't need to prove to people we don't like that we're ok with being mainstream.
$C: Just like Santa, there is no such thing as legos, it's Lego bricks. such a shame to spoil a fantastic high quality jif.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Serious Question: Why do you feel it’s appropriate to lie to children?

Edit: downvotes don’t answer the question
$C: Lying to your kids that a mythical fat man brings you gifts is probably the worst thing you could do for a child’s development tbh. Lies, deceit, trust issues. Sounds like great stuff. Lol
$C: You're goddamn right we are.
$C: I certainly hope so.
$C: Oh this is just the beginning. We’re going to have YouTube reenactments next year.
$C: It's kind of like posting the "motherfucking bootleg fireworks" video on 4th of July, it'll be obligatory and it never gets old. I watch it every year and I still laugh. 
$C: YOU'RE GOD DAMN RIGHT WE ARE
$C: YES IT DESERVES TO GET REPOSTED AND I HOPE IT BURNS IN HELL!
$C: This is the best quality you will ever see it. This masterpiece will be reposted into an oblivion of pixels
$C: HQG giveth to Reddit.

r/all taketh and says they originally giveth. 
$C: Just a reminder to see reposts of this in December before it gets archived
$C: And you’re gonna like it!!
$C: *saves the gif to his phone*
$C: Who said it hasn't been already?
$C: Don't expect it to take a whole year.
$C: I am going to repost this comment every year.
$C: YOU CANT HANDLE THE TRUTH,but yes
yes we will. Every God Damn December.
$C: Shit, I might even repost it on Christmas Eve and say "The conversation I'm having with my son right now."
$C: YOU CAN'T HANDLE ORIGINAL CONTENT!
$C: There are worse things. 
$C: Yes! Just maybe. It's so cool!
$C: God I hope so
$C: And we're gonna love it.
$C: Wait are you saying this isn't a repost? Am I witnessing original content for the first time!? 
$C: I was here when it came out 4 months ago. I came back because I'm watching the scene from A few Good Men right now. XD
$C: It is very good, you gotta admit.
$C: 8 years from now, why would someone want a Nintendo Switch?
$C: We all grow up and get to be Santa.

$C: That's gold Jerry! Gold!
$C: Just when i thought i was out...they pull me back in
$C: Did you grab your thinking bat?
$C: Lol
$C: At 22x Gilded, I believe in Santa too, my god I’ve never been gilded let alone 22 times! I think I need to write Santa this year!
$C: Shouldn’t it have ended with “you’re goddamn right he isnt”?
$C: I even had time to make popcorn during the gif it was so damn long. Nice.
$C: my therapist helped me see that i had to handle the truth too early and now I have a fear of failure and trichotillomania.
$C: It's Gold Jerry. Gold!
$C: What tier?
$C: That's because it was made by top men.


Who?


Top. Men. 
$C: Yeah, I suspect this will be one of the most upvoted posts in Reddit history
$C: This is the christmas gift of memes

- Eric Foreman
$C: I would have preferred it to go the way of “did you put the presents under the tree?” “You’re god damn right I did!” It follows the original scene better. 
$C: Fits well,  ha, alternative facts.
$C: That was a lot of angst and anger; Santa will be leaving nothing but Ativan at OP's house this year and fleeing that scene as quickly as possible. 
$C: No. It was in a courtroom.
$C: Like camping! 🏕️
$C: Having sex while camping
$C: That is the correct spelling of intense. And you probably realize this, but they are making a play on the phrase "in tents"
$C: Like native American sex
$C: Kinda feel to match the movie it needed to end with Santa not being real (or an admission that the parent had made up the lie, so he can yell "you're goddamn right I did!" 
$C: Might be answered already, too lazy to scroll more, but when you camp you may have sex in a tent. Fucking intense (can be said like fucking in tents) and would kinda be like camping.

Hopefully it's not just you and Dad though for this version
$C: Just like the circus
$C: Like two gypsys
$C: You spelled intents wrong
$C: Have you ever had sex while camping? It's fucking intents!
Edit: I should have scrolled down, to little to late
$C: No, its in a court house.
$C: Like Boy Scouts in summer camp.
$C: Spot the Australian. 

> You cunts are doing it on purpose now!
$C: I need sound!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
$C: Hey, fuck you too buddy. 
$C: Seems like they preferred a nice, comfortable, wood paneled courtroom feel for this setting. A safe, non anxiety producing theme for those whom have never been near one. 

The dark accents help to heavy the mood.

*It's a good thing*

-Martha Stewart
$C: Found the Australian
$C: The joke is "in tents". Like you are saying that our location is in tents. That's why they are saying no it was in a court room.
$C: It just kept on giving
$C: It seriously may be the best thing I've seen on reddit
$C: Absolutely amazing, every second of it, right down to^^* the judge being the spouse.
$C: Yes, long but excellent.  I laughed the hardest when the movie lines fit perfectly into the story.


You're god damn right he is!
$C: All the Oscar candidates always come at the end of the year.
$C: Like....I legit teared up a bit

I realized I'll have to have that conversation with my daughter, and even though she's one right now, that'll break both our hearts

Huh
$C: GIF of the New Year!

$C: Gif of the Decade.
$C: Greatest thing the internet has ever made.

$C: Gotta love it when the best is saved for the last minute.  12 days left in the year, we finally have a winner.  Well done by OP.
$C: The best Christmas GIF

kill me
$C: Ever. Best gif ever. 
$C: Seconded. It's just so perfect. So on point.
$C: Me too 
$C: This is the best thing I have ever seen
$C: This truly is one of the greatest things I've ever seen and I usually hate this type of thing.

It's.....it's perfect....
$C: Seriously. I expected it to cut off at the “You can’t handle the truth” but it kept giving. 10/10 would recommend.
$C: I was on the edge if my seat 
$C: It's the 21st Century "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus"

A darker story, for a darker time. 
$C: Coming in late but incredible immersive. 10/10
$C: This is the gif of the year, I haven't seen anything better than this 
$C: I feel as if I believe in Santa again...
$C: Instant classic.
$C: Someone promote this man.

$C: the best part for me was how animated he was in saying WANT and NEED, and the way he said them perfectly timed to my reading. 
$C: Just realised I paused the music I was listening to to read it lol 
$C: Nope.  I know that scene so well that I heard everything in the characters voices.  Awesome.
$C: r/noisygifs
$C: Nope. Heard em the whole time.
$C: would you say its high quality?
$C: Hear it? I can fucking see it.
$C: That wasn't a video clip?
$C: Is it strange that I thought the “ignore the sounds from the living room” were about sexytime? 


On my third watch I was “Oh, they are down there placing the gifts under the tree.”
$C: From what movie is this?
$C: Even I heard it. 
$C: https://i.imgur.com/581z6P8.gif
$C: This gif deserves an academy award..
$C: Attenboroughitis.
$C: I only heard Nicholson, oddly.
$C: That ending though. *chills*
$C: The kids are sleeping next to me and I was afraid they could wake up because of the screaming. 
$C: Btw: this comment went from like 25 upvotes a half an hour ago to 1539 now.

EDIT: after 53 minutes, 6283. It's amazing!
$C: Whats even crazier is I heard Tom cruise's lines in my nephews voice. 
$C: Not at all.  Epic greatness carries its own sound file.
$C: You have a GIFt my friend
$C: Nope. Not at all. One of the greatest scenes of all time
$C: Yep, you know how weird it is to hear tom cruise call jack "daddy"?
$C: I've watched these two actors often enough that I can hear them saying what's subtitled.
$C: Right? Me too! Thought I was the only one.
$C: r/noisygifs

$C: > Is it strange I can hear this gif?

YOU'RE GOD DAMNED RIGHT IT IS!!!
$C: r/noisygifs
$C: I held my ear up to the speaker on my phone multiple times despite knowing there was no sound. I swore I heard jack a couple times. 
$C: My favorite part was when he called him Daddy.
$C: If some voice talent doesn't show up in this thread and make this audio come to life I'm gonna burn this website to the ground
$C: I started imagining the words too
$C: Yes... Jk
$C: Not strange at all... I heard every word
$C: I haven’t even seen this movie and I can hear this gif
$C: I still heard "You, Lt. Weinberg?!" despite whatever words were showing.
$C: At this length it should be considered a video
$C: I’ve never seen this movie and I still heard their voices. 
$C: I heard it too
$C: r/noisygifs
$C: I heard every word
$C: nope
$C: I almost forgot it was a gif. Thanks for reminding. :D

Actually I was thinking about how to have such a conversation with my 4-year-old nephew while watching.
$C: I have watched that scene countless times that not only can I hear it I can hear the intonation of their voices
$C: Tom looked like he spoke like a 10 year old
$C: I even hear Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson's voices.
$C: yes. seek help.
$C: You're a pussy. Jack Nicholson would have maintained the myth by giving the kid a pistol to sleep with, to calm his nerves.
$C: We were in Indigo the other day and my son noticed the display of Elves on the Shelves. He wandered over and sort of peeked open the edge of one of the boxes and then got all wide-eyed and turned to me with 'Daddy! These boxes actually have real elves in them!' 
$C: You could've just told him that Santa already knew it bothered him and so he would leave his presents by the front/back door. C'mon, people! Lying to your 5-year-old should be super simple stuff.
$C: I don't understand the issue other parents have with this...  

I told my kids that Santa is pretend, but it's fun to pretend so we go along with it.  She still gets into it because she's a kid and very excitable, and there's no secret to keep. win-win.

Do we go around telling the kids that Dora The Explorer or Mickey Mouse aren't real mutants?  No.  So why do we treat Santa any differently?
$C: "Later that night I dressed up like Santa with a chainsaw and kicked down his door, screaming, covered in fake blood and cookie crumbs..."
$C: Thats... and odd reaction for a kid to have.
$C: When my goddaughter was wee she was afraid of people in masked costumes. On Christmas Eve someone dresses up as Santa  who gives out a few small presents and we take pictures. So one year my cousin was Santa, and he had to pull down the beard to show who it really was because she was freaking out.

Some time before or after that, my uncle took her to the college where he worked. Subway was on campus doing some promotion and had a mascot there. Later, on the way home, she said, "When I get big, I'm not going to go to college because I don't like the sandwich man."
$C: Honestly, looking back, that seems like a much more appropriate response... Why was I ever excited by the idea of a stranger breaking in?
$C: Had similar problem. Solution:

"Okay, let's write a letter to Santa explaining that your scared. Santa's very nice, he'll understand."

Next day, after "mailing":

"Look, Bobby, Santa wrote back! It says he'll send one of his trainee reindeer with an elf to deliver your presents to daddy's work the day before Christmas Eve. Then Daddy can put your presents under the tree so Santa doesn't have to come by. Santa says he'll miss the yummy cookies but thanks you for shortening his trip; he can get back home to Mrs. Claus faster, now."
$C: Now I'm imagining this was a ruse to get you to fess up.

*Kid suddenly stops crying and his face goes stone-cold.*

"Thanks.  That's what I wanted to know."
$C: I think once you get to five or six, the ruse is over. Or should be. OP's gif said his children were ten and seven. Ten is definitely too old. You're halfway to twenty! In six more years you'll be driving!
$C: That's actually a really adorable way for the truth to come out. 
$C: I was exactly the same way as a kid but I never mentioned it to my parents and I eventually just pieced together that it was them, I remember when I first caught them and it was a huge wave of relief.
$C: I don't remember if my siblings spoiled it or if I just figured it out really young, but I was about that old when I was aware that Santa wasn't real and it didn't really bother me :/ I guess I didn't mind that my parents were the ones giving me free awesome stuff.
$C: Well, one less thing you gotta worry about.


6yrs old and going strong here!
$C: Smart kid
$C: You should have ordered any siblings to give him a "Code Red."
$C: i don't remember believing in santa, not because my parents had to explain it, they're just really really bad at sneaking. 

I held it for a few years because kids believing in santa makes parents happy. 
$C: The kid might have a future working in security.  A healthy dose of paranoia is good to have in that profession.
$C: My cousins had the same issue as a kid but with the tooth fairy. They cried at the thought of someone coming into their room at night and taking their teeth from beneath their pillow. My aunt told them it wasn’t real. Santa and the Easter bunny didn’t last much longer after that either...
$C: I was one of the very few Jews in my town growing up. I remember asking my parents "what's this whole Santa thing about" and then very quickly and nonchalantly told me it was all made up. I was sleeping over a friend's house once and told him Santa was made up and it was really all his parents. He cried his parents awake and his mother was *really* pissed off at me. She actually yelled at me and made me tell her son I was lying and that Santa really was real. 

So the next morning, I told him that Santa was real...

But that Jesus was made up.
$C: My daughter has started to complain that Santa is a creepy stalker because he watches her and knows things about her. She asked if he is watching her take a bath. 
$C: Your kid is smarter than most people.
$C: Hes a smart one. Definitelly a keeper.
$C: My daughter (now 5) has known the truth from day one. I haven't questioned the decision once. I really doubt propagating the myth would have made her any happier than she is this time of year. The holidays are magical for kids no matter what.
$C: My cousin was also afraid of this, so her parents put the gifts on the front lawn.
$C: Clever boy. I wish everyone would be like him in that regard.
$C: I did bad guy spray for my daughter at one point.  Spray bottle of water, spray by the door at bed time so bad guys can't get in.
$C: Just wait until he figures out the government steals 40% of his paychecks!

$C: Out of curiosity, what was the original military video?
$C: Yep, this is gold. Thanks for the laugh, OP.
$C: You fucked the whole /r/highqualitygifs circlejerk with one dick thrust. You are the new gif god, even though you didn't even know how to turn that into a GIF, which makes it even more awesome.
$C: What's an ass GIF?
$C: “Legos” 
$C: very nicely done. 
$C: Aw fuck, i spent 3 minutes reading a gif
$C: I there was a website where we could add our own text, this would be the new Hitler rant gif.
$C: It's LEGO, not legos ffs
$C: I was just hoping and praying that this would not end at "you can't handle the truth!" I was not disappointed.
$C: Actually some of the best movie dialog I have seen in a long time. Powerful stuff. 
$C: Anyone else clapping while they were viewing this?? I might have clapped at only a couple of gifs in my life, and that's being kind..
$C: Link to original video?
$C: I'd rather have a shitty voice over done by you and your son, rather than the silent gif, but I guess that's me, I like the dialogue :)
$C: This is the best Christmas content I've seen this year. I love it. 
$C: i just sat and watched that for 3 minutes? Jesus christ.
$C: I can't believe I watched the whole thing. 
$C: The best thing I’ve seen on reddit
$C: That is one of the best!

$C: That didn't feel like 3 minutes at all, at first I was just waiting for _the_ quote but it just kept going on!
$C: Link to vid please!
$C: This is the best gift that I've ever seen without a doubt. Thank you so much I love this movie and Christmas.
$C: I would love this with either the real actors or damn good impersonators doing voice overs.
$C: Yes, OP. He did this all for you and not himself. Spot on
$C: https://i.imgur.com/yiY1v9W.gifv
$C: This is the longest .gif I've ever seen and it was brilliant.
$C: I want to watch the whole movie.
$C: much appreciated
$C: This sums up how my son figured it out. Then he shook his head..."The lengths you went to to lie to me."
$C: could you link me a video version please?
$C: I downloaded that gif as video so I could pause to read (didn't know there was video)
$C: Romobyl=Tom Cruise?
$C: I was wondering why this post had 10 golds...

Till I watched.

Well fucking done.
$C: You guys won Christmas, this gif will live on for many Christmas to come. People will quickly steal the idea- we'll see it on skit comedy shows, stand-up specials, shitty social media sites. 

I will tell me grandchildren about the day I saw the birth of a Christmas legend.  Well done 
$C: This was next level
$C: This is probably the best thing I've seen all year on Reddit. I'm sitting in the airport trying to not make a scene with my laughter. Thanks go out to you both and Merry Christmas.
$C: dubnobasswithmyheadman
$C: You know you can just upload Youtube videos to Gfycat directly right? And this isn't a GIF, it's an MP4 video, no conversion was necessary.
$C: Same reason he makes a list and checks it twice. Santa's one forgetful fella. 
$C: You gave a crap answer to the letter question by the way. 'because you didn't say a list so you have to write one'. 
$C: I was hoping that it was you that x-posted this here. I had to do a username check to make sure people weren't stealing your sweet Karma and SO much of that gold that you deserve! 💰💰💰
$C: I started that gif thinking “this is way too long” and ended it the third time through thinking “this is just perfect”
$C: Bro, you got 41 gold's and counting from this post across the high quality gifs and this sub
$C: That’s my favorite part 
$C: I kind of...liked it
$C: I'm more interested in whether the Judge is supposed to be "Mommy". He's the only other character that *speaks* in the gif.
$C: I got the weirdest boner from that part.
$C: Young Tom Cruise would definitely have called him Daddy. 

I mean, imagining Top Gun Tom Cruise calling an older man Daddy isn't a stretch. All sweaty and shirtless... Getting berated by his superior for playing volleyball when he damn well knows he has work to be done... He gets escorted to his CO's office for a... Tongue lashing...

... This really got out of hand. 😓
$C: Yeah no kidding. I wonder what Xenu say. 
$C: This honestly belongs in a gay sub for that reason alone...... hmmmmm perhaps r/rpdrbussybois ? 🤔
$C: Your mother and I will explain it later
$C: Should have said Dad.
$C: I'm now imagining Tom cruise getting spanked by jack Nicholson. Don't know how far to take my imagination 
$C: [Because obviously](https://i.imgur.com/jtxuGSK.jpg) here is [Nicholson's real son.](https://i.imgur.com/yG6uA2J.jpg)
$C: I heard the whole thing in my head as a weird merger of Tom Cruise's voice and a child's voice. Like if he were on helium.
$C: The fact that you felt compelled to include your edit is a sad commentary on our culture. 
$C: Tom as the kid is so perfect
$C: Don't worry, he's not his real dad. Just his step father.
$C: That’s my favorite part. 
$C: The way what they say just matches their expressions and everything perfectly... Beautiful.
$C: Doesn't really qualifies as a high quality gif though.

Those have to have moving texts and meta jokes /s
$C: The line about being constipated and “why isn’t he asleep yet” made me actually laugh out loud. Gif of the year. 
$C: Favourite line
$C: Hello, here is some culture: A Few Good Men
$C: I knew this comment would be somewhere for me to find! Thanks! 
$C: A Few Good Men - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104257/
$C: You really need to watch this movie, it's great!
$C: TIL that people exist who haven't seen a Few Good Men. 
$C: He calls it "Code Rudolph Nose."
$C: So Nicholson's there because of what happened to Vixen??
$C: Also, he sees and hears everything, that doesn't mean he's a mind reader. You need to write it down because he doesn't know what you're thinking. Then you need to send it in for filing. Santa can see your letter before you send it in, but then he'd have to tell his ~~slaves~~ elves what to make, and that'd waste a bunch of time, and they need to manage billions of presents.
$C: He needs the letters so he can give them to his elves to build in his workshop. If Santa had to tell them each item one-by-one, he would never even finish telling the elves what to create. Duhhh.
$C: I was also thinking that the premise to the questioning is flawed. There are any number of legitimate reasons for Santa to need the letters.

Even in Cruise's questions, he only stipulates to Santa seeing and hearing everything, not *knowing* everything. Unless you actually *say* everything you want, he doesn't know.
$C: Right, there are two separate unrelated things going on. 1. Determine if naughty or nice. 2. Determine which gifts they want.

If naughty, then coal. If nice, then gifts.
$C: Santa decides whether you get presents, but the elves make them, and verbal instructing them what to make is time consuming. You wrote the letter to Santa, he reviewed it and made approvals, then passed it off to data entry. The worker elves get the order and make it. 
$C: I think the best answer is "because it's a courtesy, sure he KNOWS what you want, but it's an act of kindness, and tradition to send him letters every year, to show him you do care about him and are thankful for what he does." Wow that came across less like writing to Santa and more like praying to God. 
$C: FWIW I think that the correct answer to "why do we write him letters" is for politeness. He knows that you want thing X, but it's rude to just expect him to bring it to you magically. You have to ask and say please. 


$C: this guy dads
$C: No, this is Patrick
$C: The Reddit blog post on the best of 2017 came out a few days early.

This is incredible stuff. 
$C: You're goddamn right it's art!
$C: I like that the dog was included in the family meeting. His input is important. 
$C: You've got a future scientist there
$C: That's hilarious and a lot better than my six year old.  He just told me the elf on a shelf isn't real cause his heads plastic and that Santa is a myth... maybe, he's not sure yet.
$C: Man... I feel like I was a really slow kid. I was twelve when I found out Santa wasn't real. 
$C: She's a scientist in the making. That is very thorough testing.
$C: We have a real elf on a shelf, and a NFL team themed one. 

My daughter fully accepts that one is real, and the NFL one is fake with no conflicts in her brain whatsoever.

Means I only have to move one elf though.
$C: i love the fact that she carried out 3 very different experiments on the elf to cover all bases.  
$C: > Admittedly I was a bit disturbed

Why!? Those are genius experiments. You have a very smart, analytical daughter.
$C: N=1 studies aren't great bases for major shifts in ideology.  Where was the control Elf?  Did she have IRB (Institutional Review Board) approval and oversight for her research?  That test with the scissors was borderline unethical.
$C: She doesn't sound like much of a 'young 7'
$C: You didn’t notice that the elf was wearing pipe cleaner hand cuffs?
$C: I used to try to disprove Santa to my parents at around that age, too! I compared the bites out of the cookies to the bites on cookies that I had my dad take a bite of. I checked the handwriting on the tags on the presents. I compared the wrapping paper. I noticed that a lot of presents tended to be sold at the place my mom happened to work that year, or at least were packed in reused boxes from somewhere she had worked before. I tried to stay up all night and catch them in the act. I'm an adult now and they still insist that Santa is real.
$C: How did you not notice the pipe cleaners
$C: >The night before the family meeting, the last experiment she did was to put scissors over Squint’s legs and close them ever so slightly to see how Squint would respond, stopping just short of actually cutting Squint’s legs.

You need to have a talk with her about research ethics. She's not going to get any funding with that attitude.
$C: Holy shit that's some impressive stuff. I recommend the book ada twist scientist if she doesn't have it yet.
$C: A young 7? Hmm, I must have a newborn 10yo that still believes 😂
$C: I’m not quite sure what spoiled it for our ten year old, but she came in this year and said “Drop the act and put the stuff under the tree already, I’ve know for years.”

When pressed for how she knew her only response has been “Science”
$C: A natural critical thinker. Please foster this ability in her and she will learn to detect bullshit when she needs to. 
$C: Both my 8 year old daughter and 7 year old son have both an iPad and a iPhone (the phones are just my wife and I's old 5s phone handed down without a cell plan).

My son, one evening, just before going to bed had set up both iPads and iPhones to record around the family room as "security cameras". His mission was to capture Bobby the elf's movement at night.

His iPad was under the tree and just after he set it up to record, he flashes the thumbs up and then went to bed.
$C: My daughter had a similar epiphany at about 5 y/o, but hers started with the Easter Bunny.  Her brother, who was 15 at the time hid the (plastic) easter eggs for me that year.  He taped one to the ceiling.  Daughter was fine accepting that a bunny could break into our house carrying a basket of candy, but could not accept that he could jump up to the ceiling and stay aloft long enough to tape up the egg.  So, after I admitted to her that he wasnt real, she asked the next logical question, What about the tooth fairy?  Nope, not real.  The look on her face when she realized what was next, was nothing short of horror:  "Santa?"  Nope, not real.  She cried, but then started considering things, calmed down, took a deep breath and said dreamily.  "It all makes sense now."  I love that kid.
$C: What a curious and thorough child!
$C: Your daughter's articulation and methodology are much better than half of adults approaching their problems in life. You got a bright young lady sir.
$C: she was willing to kill an elf in the name of science... wheres her scholarship?!
$C: Your daughter has a very bright future ahead of her.
$C: Your progeny’s critical thinking skills are better than most of reddit’s. Well done OP. 
$C: That's when you tell them they are old enough to BE a Santa now, then put them in charge of picking a Santa gift for someone.
$C: Not sure if it's already been posted, but this is how I'd handle it if my kids found d out about Santa www.upworthy.com/amp/theres-a-brilliant-heartfelt-way-to-tell-your-kids-the-truth-about-santa-take-notes
$C: The elf on the shelf is a weak link in the whole Santa affair.  I'm almost fairly certain my just turned 3 year old is going to figure it out next Christmas, of the following one tops, and it will be because of that.

Santa is real right now, she's seen and talked to him.

We just introduced the elf on the shelf to her this year, the conversation went like this:

* Me: You can't touch the elf, he's magical
* Daughter: He's not magical, he's just a stuffed animal like the rest of my stuffed animals, he's not alive.
* Wife: He's magical because he watches you and then flies to the north poll every night and tells Santa what you did that day....
* Daughter: That's creepy... precedes to ask why that elf is magical and her other toys aren't every single day.

Next few days:  

* Daughter: How did the elf get up there?
* Me: He either flew or climbed up.
* Daughter: I can't climb up a wall, you can't climb up a wall that's too hard, he would have fallen.  The elf doesn't have any wings to fly...  I want to see him fly.
* Me: You can't, he only flies when he knows you can't see him.
* Daughter: What happens if I touch him.
* Me: He loses his magic and can't go see Santa every night.
* Daughter: I don't want him to be magical, I want to play with him.  Can we give him more magic?
* Me: No, we don't have any magic to give him.
* Daughter:  I have a magic wand, that would work.

It's only a matter of time before she connects the dots and it leads her right back to Santa.

$C: This is undoubtedly science, because [she wrote it down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSUMBBFjxrY).
$C: Yeah you did it wrong, elves on the shelf are just vessels for a noncorporeal being, that travels between shells in order to spy on more kids, as such it was not present in the doll during her experiments, thus the lack of reaction. The "don't touch" rule is there simply because the spirit entity doesn't want to come back to a body with mustaches, or some other vandalism, or pranks done to it.
$C: “NO Mr. Squint! I expect you to DIE!”
$C: Squints is real, he was calling her bluff. His poker face is unparalleled. As for the bribes... Santa teaches all elfs not to accept bribes, there is a code of ethics that all elves adhere to. They are master escape artists explaining how he got out of the cuffs. And his magic didn't leave him upon the child's touch because there are two children in the house his magic only depleted by 50 percent which is still enough to cause mischief. 



All jokes aside that's an awesome story glad she isn't ruining it for the younger one. 
$C: Someone is getting a chemistry set for Christmas. Scientist in the making right there. 
$C: Have her watch toy story. There are tons of near death toy scenes where they can't break the scene where they're living. Game over.
$C: Surely each of the experiments proves nothing and you could have carried on without telling her the truth.? 

"Touching or moving the elf doesn't actually remove the magic, but they say that so you don't touch or or move him because he really doesn't like it". "Pipe cleaners aren't going to stop him as he's magic". "He hasn't been for the treats because he knows it's wrong. He doesn't accept bribes". And as for her threatening to cut his legs, "He doesn't come to life to prevent damage. He doesn't need to. If you cut his legs, he simply magics them back together. Elves can be hurt or killed, so they don't fear anything".
$C: Is the dog ok after finding out Santa and Squint aren’t real?
$C: > The night before the family meeting, the last experiment she did was to put scissors over Squint’s legs and close them ever so slightly to see how Squint would respond, stopping just short of actually cutting Squint’s legs. She said that any living thing would not have trusted her to stop and would have moved away or fought back and therefore, he’s not real.

both smart and alarming
$C: Did you tell her maybe squints just a hardcore motherfucker and wouldnt flinch no matter what.
$C: > The first experiment was to touch and move the elf, which kids are not supposed to do according to the book because it takes away the elf’s magic.

This is a common misconception about the rules of elf on a shelf. The book is the English translation of the original Old Persian elf on a shelf and this rule was misinterpreted. It doesn't take ALL of the elf's magic, just some of the magic. Experiments have shown that it would take several hundred children's touches to remove all magic.

> She cuffed Squint’s hands and feet with pipe cleaners but noted he still moved that night.

Elf magic.

> She told him to move to specific areas under the bribe that if he does, he will find treats.

Elves are incorruptible (unlike politicians). No surprise he didn't succumb to this tactic.

> The night before the family meeting, the last experiment she did was to put scissors over Squint’s legs and close them ever so slightly to see how Squint would respond, stopping just short of actually cutting Squint’s legs. She said that any living thing would not have trusted her to stop and would have moved away or fought back and therefore, he’s not real.

Disturbing...AND the training these elves go through is incredible. They've been trained to ignore pain. There's nothing she could've done to get him to "give up the goods."

$C: What is an elf on the shelf? And why does it move??
$C: Holy shit! I can not think of myself conducting or even thinking of doing expirements for anything as a kid. I was... a dumb kid... Lol
$C: Your daughter is going to make one hell of a scientist. That was brilliant. All I ever did as a child was tell my parents Santa is a jerk when my present showed up late. 
$C: Any chance of you throwing a toy microscope in with her presents? There are some cheap ones on Amazon. 7 seems young for a microscope, but I would have thought 7 was young for this type of experimentation as well.

Edit: Also, I can totally see this being a series of Calvin and Hobbes strips if elf on a shelf had been a thing then.
$C: Me and my partner have been doing the elf on the shelf thing for a few years for our now 8 year old. We both work and sometimes my wife has to stayover when working late.

My wife normally does the writing of the note but obviously she cant when shes away so i have to try and copy her handwriting.

I have since found out from my mother-in-law that a couples of times she has come over to watch the kids my daughter has passed her the note I have written saying 'I cant read daddys handwriting when he is trying to be someone else.'

Fuck! Magic destroyed.
$C: I learned figured santa wasn't real when I was 6 I lost a tooth and put it under my pillow as my mother told me to. When I woke up I asked why is my tooth still there and she said "I forgot" figured tooth fairy wasn't real and santa wasn't either.
$C: Don't be disturbed man, be proud! That's a smart cookie.
$C: Don't be disturbed or worried, she showed exceptional ability to follow the scientific method and to follow rational thought at just 7 years of age.

Get her thinking about science and space, she could be an astronaut one day.
$C: It seems like your daughter has the makings of an excellent scientist. She followed the scientific method and presented her findings to her peers and drew a conclusion. I would highly encourage you to get her some books on experiments and maybe have her watch some documentaries. You're great parents and  did a great job by letting her follow on her train if thought! Kudos! 
$C: When you involve the family dog, you know shit is real.
$C: So, how long until she discovers religion is bullshit also?
$C: My daughter, at 7, asked Siri tell tell her what Santa is doing. Thanks Apple, you crushed Santa.
$C: I really hope you nurture this quality of curiosity in her. She will likely lead a much happier, more fulfilling life if you support her natural inclination to test and learn things.
$C: She pulled an Oliver Stone on you. My advice to you, Keep her away from church. 
$C: This is off point but I love that you have family meetings.  We used to hold those with our girls too.  They were 5 1/2 years apart.  We sort of assumed they would be our only children.  But when the oldest was 13 and the younger 8 1/2 we had a baby boy.  They thought it a great travesty when he was allowed to vote at the family meetings when he learned to talk well enough at 3 or 3 1/2.  Previously , they'd carried a tacit majority if they voted with either of their parents, should we disagree.  With his vote he upset their political power structure.
$C: She is super logical and smart. She's impressive.  I can't even get my undergrads (research lab) to keep good notes. 
$C: Please tell me you also told her how awesome it is that she did all that? 
$C: When I was a kid, I just left a note for Santa in the fireplace asking him to eat the entire cookie this year instead of taking just a bite. I also asked him to take my letter with him. 
The Cookie still had a single bite, and the note was there in Christmas morning. That year was a bit gloomy for me.
$C: I didn't stop believing in Santa until 5th grade even then me and my brother realize. If we stopped believing in Santa we stopped get gifts for Christmas. Around 7th grade my parents came out and told the truth and we told them we know and just want presents for Christmas and we still get presents to this day even though we are adults.
$C: I'm impressed that she really thought this through and came up with a way to test her hypothesis. She definitely needs to study for a career in science.
She now needs to submit her finding for peer review to replicate the results.
$C: You’re lucky she took it so well. I honestly felt super betrayed, and embarrassed when I learned Santa wasn’t real. The thought that all of the adults in my life, the people who were the ultimate authority on everything, would conspire to lie about this bullshit thing. When I confronted my mom she laughed because it was “so cute”. I felt like they were all having fun at my expense, like it was amusing to watch me believe wholeheartedly in something I never would have imagined if they hadn’t lied to me about it in the first place. I was really crushed, not by the knowledge, but by the deceit. I still don’t trust/believe anything anyone tells me unless there’s some corroborating evidence.
$C: I was all with it until the cutting. Better cultivate her search for science *and* ethics!
$C: Get that girl a microscope or a chemistry set for Christmas. I know Adults that aren't this intelligent. 
$C: She'll have a lot of fun with the Bible
$C: r/wokekids
$C: This kids going places. It would be interesting to see what she does with her life. Remindme! 13 years
$C: Your daughter is going places.  Bribery, torture, atheism through scientific process and recording her conclusions.  She'll be working for No Such Agency in no time.  
$C: That's not disturbing - that's so intelligent! Not a lot of 7 year olds would practically invent the scientific method on their own!
$C: Yeah none of that happened whatsoever.
$C: This is why my wife and I put our elf in places the kids can't reach!
$C: Holy shit your daughter has a very bright future ahead of her! Nothing to be disturbed by. If anything I'd be in awe.
$C: Now you need to let her watch Chucky and start randomly putting the elf in her room, after Christmas with scratched notes that say, “You ruined Christmas.”  After a few times of this add various possible weapons near the elf.
$C: Nuture that inquisitive side. Your daughter may make an amazing scientist or engineer one day :)
$C: GET THIS KID INVOLVED IN STEM RIGHT NOW!

it is EXTREMELY rare for a child of 7 years to have the ability to come up with a hypothesis and test it with experimentation, let alone record their findings in a notebook.  You should be super proud!


When she hits middle School see if she's interested at all in Odessey Of the Mind or robot league or something similar.  I did OOM in middle School and it was fantastically entertaining.
$C: A young seven? That kid's a young 35. It's things like that that make me excited about the next generation. 
$C: This kid is smart, they got potential
$C: She will either end up a scientist or an r/conspiracy subscriber.
$C: That's pretty good work there. How did she take it? I never really thought about it but my eldest is 6 now and I'm not sure how she'll take this betrayal. 
$C: See, what you should do now is not put any presents out for her on Xmas morning. Then as she see’s her brother opening gifts from Santa you can be like, whoops guess you were wrong!

I prank my kid all the time and now he never believes a thing I say. I may have bad parenting’d myself into a corner. Please don’t take my advice. 
$C: I would be so proud of my (future) daughter if she did this. That's the kind of kid I want to raise.
$C: that is an incredibly smart kid. keep it up bud, whatever you've done is working.
$C: I don't know why but I'm picturing Hermione Granger
$C: You should be proud of your daughter. She is incredibly intelligent for her age :).
$C: Out of curiosity, did the person in charge of moving the elf not notice the pipe cleaners?
$C: Now give her science experiments. And a composition notebook. That scientific method made me so proud :')
$C: I wish I was this smart
$C: > After employing a series of "enhanced interrogation techniques" I learned from watching Homeland, I have determined that Squint is not real and that waterboarding has a 100% efficacy rate"

- Note written by your daughter for future therapy sessions.

$C: Find her some kid level mystery books, and maybe find a show that's not too violent where there's a mystery involved. Make a scavenger hunt for her with clues that get more complex. Foster this talent!!!! Your child employed very logical and scientific methods to figure out a mystery/problem... you may be disturbed by what she did, but she sounds smart & gifted to me.
$C: Just leave her coal with a note that says I know what u did
$C: Your daughter sounds like an incredibly smart 7yo. No way I was conducting experiments and then calling grown ups out on their shit. She could be a badass investigator or lawyer when she grows up. 
$C: And this is one of the many reasons why I think the Elf on the Shelf is something I would never do.
$C: When you watch to much Sherlock.
$C: I am not sure if the second time around would be the same, but I would be tempted to video her explanation for her for when she is an adult. At the very least I would save your printed explanation for her... put it in letter form and give it to her at some later date... If she decides to have children herself, perhaps at the birth of her first so she knows what she has to look forward too.

It is really a great story.
$C: My parents would look over my Christmas list before putting it in an envelope and "mailing it to Santa". I got suspicious around the same age as your daughter, and started adding small, cheap items to the list after my parents read it, but before it was sealed in the envelope. Obviously those items were the only ones I didn't get. You got a damn smart kid, congratulations.
$C: Jesus, smart kid. I remember when my friend group had to break the news to our buddy.. We were 13.. His parents thought it was funny.. He didn’t believe us.
$C: I've had a really hard time getting on board with this whole elf on a shelf thing and your story only reinforces my prejudice. 
$C: The real issue here is your failure to create a proper mythology. You should not have had an elf. A proper ideology like this would be entirely unfalsifiable. You may have to change the narrative slightly and limit your kids contact with the outside world, but it is worth it to keep Santa alive. Santa should have absolutely no physical representations. You must explain that all media representations of Santa are not the real Santa, but ideas of what the real Santa is like. Putting a little fear into their hearts helps prevent them from sneaking a look at the presents, I told my kid that if you leave your room at all on Christmas eve Santa would cut his eyes out. If he tried to listen, he would go deaf. I even make sure that he had limited contact with other kids so he couldn't hear anything from them. You really need to keep your kid on the edge to keep the Christmas magic alive. I had him going until he was 20.

Also I have no kids. Don't do this.

What? you should be proud. Your daughter is bright
$C: Your daughter is gonna go far.  
$C: That girl is going places
$C: I love the snacks part 
$C: That's about the age I was when I compared the hand writing on the gift tags. Santa's writing was just like my moms. But I was not even remotely organized or stealthy about it. Your daughter is smart!
$C: I set up a trap for Santa when I was about 6 or so that involved scissors etc hanging from my bedroom door that would fall when it was opened. I hoped to catch Santa to prove that he was real. 

My father was not impressed at 1am. 
$C: I didn't know kids believed in elf on the shelf.  I mean santa I know, but I thought they just thought elf on the shelf was silly fun.  That would actually be crazy creepy and way less believable than santa. 
$C: I asked Santa for his autograph and a picture of himself. Thought I was super clever. 

This was before you could just get a pic of Santa off the internet so my parents had to call around to everyone in the family to see who had one, but sure enough, there was a pic and autograph. Kept me going for another year. 
$C: your story reminded me of Neil DeGrasse Tyson Mentioning a similar experiment her daughter did on Tooth fairy. Very entertaining watch. [Link!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsR6sIsoWgU)
$C: Oh crap, I forgot to move the elf! 
$C: I really really really loved the inclusion of the dog for the family meeting.  It just SO perfectly sets the tone for this post!  
$C: That kid has a bright future in the intelligence community. She didn't even had to water board Squint. Good job, Mom and Dad!
$C: Cant find it now but i once read an admittedly alarmist article about "elf on the shelf" preparing children for a surveillance state, seems some of the damage they thought would come about is real...

$C: Santa: A Ridiculous Capitalist Myth

It amazes me that so many allegedly "educated" people have fallen so quickly and so hard for a fraudulent fabrication of such laughable proportions. The very idea that santa happens to come to our house, showing itself in neat, 1-year cycles -- with the same amount of presents all the time -- is ludicrous. Furthermore, it is an insult to common sense and a damnable affront to intellectual honesty and integrity. That people actually believe it is evidence that the capitalists have wrested the last vestiges of control of our public school system from decent, God-fearing Americans (as if any further evidence was needed! Daddy's Roommate? God Almighty!)

Documentaries such as Enemy of the State have accurately portrayed the elaborate, byzantine network of surveillance satellites that the capitalists have sent into space to spy on law-abiding Americans. Equipped with technology developed by Amazon Inc., these satellites have the ability to detect children from hundreds of kilometers up. That's right, neighbors .. the next time you're out in the backyard exercising your gift giving rights, the capitalists will see it! These satellites are sensitive enough to tell the difference between an Xbox and a ps4! And when they detect you with a gift, their computers cross-reference the address to figure out your name, and then an enormous database housed at Berkeley is updated with information about you.

Of course, this all works fine during the day, but what about at night? Even the capitalists can't control the rotation of the Earth to prevent nightfall from setting in (only Joshua was able to ask for that particular favor!) That's where "santas workshop" comes in. Powered by nuclear reactors, "Santa's workshop" is nothing more than an enormous balloon, emitting trillions of dollars of presents. Piloted by key members of the capitalist community,, "santa" is strategically moved across the country, pointing out those who dare to make use of their God-given rights at night!

Yes, I know this probably sounds paranoid and preposterous, but consider this. Despite what the revisionist historians tell you, there is no mention of "santa" anywhere in literature or historical documents -- anywhere -- before 1950. That is when it was initially launched. When President Josef Kennedy, at the State of the Union address, proclaimed "Santa is real", he may as well have said "the tooth fairy is real." The subsequent faking of a "santa" visits on national TV was the first step in a long history of the erosion of our constitutional rights by capitalists in this country. No longer can we hide from our government when christmas happens.
$C: But this will have a second good effect when he's a teen/ adult, of knowing that you did everything you could to give him a good Christmas. He'll appreciate what a good dad you've been. I grew up in a poor household and I know I looked back in awe of how hard my parents worked to give me things they genuinely couldn't afford. It makes me love and appreciate them every day.
$C: Seriously. I blew way too much money on something for my kid. 

And now I'm imagining she is going respond like I would "thanks, dad. That's cool." Argh! Show some feelings! Don't be like your emotionally repressed parents! Stay a child a little longer!

$C: When my youngest daughter was about 8 she too was starting to turn into a non-believer.  That year I had bought a Playstation 2 (while my wife was with me at Toys R Us) but she didnt see the purchase.  At Toys R Us you get a slip of paper for the video game stuff, pay for it, then take the slip to the security gate to get your stuff.  

Anyway, Christmas morning comes, strange gift was there, daughter opens it, proceeds to freak out.  Mom is looking at me like I am about to die.  Daughter says "That's it, Santa's real, Mom would kill Dad if he bought this!"  Mom puts on a smile and says "Yes she would!"

And that is how we got at least 2 more years of belief.
$C: He's playing his mom.  "Daddy got me this even though he can't afford it."
$C: > "How is one guy going to go to all those houses and deliver presents to kids in one night?"

This is where you start throwing in some pseudo-scientific shit at a level a kid would grasp. Respond like this:

> You: "You know those cookies we and everyone else around the world bake for Santa every year?"

> Him: "Yeah."

> You: "Do you know why we bake them?"

> Him: "To make him happy?"

> You: "Nope. You see, Santa can actually slow down time. But to do that, he needs a *lot* of energy. Cookies help him recharge every time he slows time down, which lets him travel to each and every house at the blink of an eye."

And if he's still skeptical:

> Him: "No one can slow down time. That's impossible!"

> You: "Actually, you can. It's called 'relativity'. Einstein came up with the idea and other scientists proved it. I can show you if you don't believe me."

If he bites, you can bring up the Hafele–Keating experiment and explain it in simple terms. Kid won't understand a single fucking word of the actual science, but they can see that it's a real thing and that flying is involved, so he might shut up for a while. That would be my approach, anyway :)
$C: I was that kid. 
My mom (single parent) got me a trampoline one year. Real deal shit without nets on the side and no padding so you're for sure gonna break a leg or snag a nut in a spring or some shit... 
Well how the hell did momm-o: 
A) Get this thing home? And 
2) Who the heckin' put it together?! 

Damn right Santa is real. Trampoline strapped to the sleigh was WAY more plausible than my poor mom affording and building that thing.


Nah she had a guy friend from work do it while I was asleep.
$C: Shit dude :(
$C: My parents always used the excuse that Santa's Sleigh had limited space. That's why I got a [Hiss Tank](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-txCcP0BUivE/V7FH8dA59MI/AAAAAAAAG2Y/kqd6H5-DlCQvBkPtmN3ifZki2AXdy421ACLcB/s1600/83hisstank01.jpg) instead of the [USS Flagg](http://www.hisstank.com/forum/attachments/g-i-joe-toys-vintage-discussion/111461d1341441704-uss-flagg-owners-unite-uss-flagg-birthday-gijoe.jpg) like this cool kid.


$C: > Spez: Shit, I absolutely totally just remember what his actual excuse was for thinking Santa was not real. "How is one guy going to go to all those houses and deliver presents to kids in one night?" I had one job... and I botched it. :'(

Spez? Is that asshole running around editing people's comments again?
$C: Kid already knows.  He's just playing you two for more expensive toys.
$C: I love hearing how kids rationalize Santa doubts. $130 for one toy? Glad I don't have kids now.
$C: When I was a kid I was also confused as to how one man dropped off presents for every kid. I had a head canon that each major metropolitan area had a Santa agent that was responsible for their zone. They all report back to the mastermind Santa in the North Pole of course who looks like traditional santa. 
$C: What's that spez thing
$C: Oh man. It's nice to see that you maintain a (apparent) good relationship with your ex. I don't know his mom, but it does appear that he has a great father.

I wish the best for you and your kid.
$C: Your kid's mom?
$C: The best way to conceal your Santa identity is to be poor the rest of the year!
$C: When I asked for street fighter one year I got the Tiger game version of it. Fucking kids these days. 
$C: This is why I believed in Santa until I was 14. I always had awesome Christmas presents and there seemed to be no way my parents could afford them.
$C: Am I the only one who looks at the bottom of a reply this long looking for Undertaker to throw Mankind off Hell in a cell before investing time to read it?!?
$C: Haha using Spez as edit, love it my fellow pede
$C: I cried
$C: That endorsement gets thrown around a lot on Reddit but this time I completely agree.
$C: Subscribe to more subreddits and youll find great underliked material daily
$C: Good scene, just wish the audio were better synced with the video, as it's hurting the impact of the scene
$C: why are you so far down
$C: ctrl-f source
$C: Great freaking movie. 
$C: And it was over too soon. Now I want the whole movie remade to discuss Santa and his existence.  
$C: I watched it twice :p
$C: I prefer 'lego bricks' or 'lego pieces' but never 'legos' because i'm not a bloody savage.
$C: I saw that, scoffed and planned to attack. Thanks for getting ahead of the game, man. 
$C: While I am aware of this truth, I will never stop myself from saying "playing with Legos" or other variations. It's how i said it growing up and even the official corporate response (http://www.adrants.com/images/lego_sorry.gif) to it can't stop me from saying it. I am fine with this.
$C: source?
$C: My favorite part. I love that the confession at the end is that Santa *is* real. Feelsgoodman
$C: You need more gold! ;) 
$C: In my family we have a don't ask/don't tell santa policy. If you want gifts from santa you have to believe in him. 

I'm 35 and I still get a stocking at my moms house. I'm not going to mess with a good deal. 
$C: I was expecting maybe a 10-second loop.

I did not expect the entire fucking scene, with subtitles carefully timed to match the lip movements.

I remain in awe.
$C: Top Shelf Elf.
$C: Maybe the best GIF I've ever seen.
$C: This was actually really cool and I heard it in my head in their actual voices lol.
$C: Funny and poignant...freaking EPIC
$C: >Top elf

FTFY
$C: Spoilers: Snoke is Santa Claus.
$C: Damn kids these days, getting on Reddit and they ain't even old enough to know Santa isn't real. 
$C: https://i.imgur.com/AWlGFnu.gif
$C: If you haven't seen a movie in 5 years your spoiler protection is void.
$C: That must have been the anchoring point. Everything merged around it so perfectly
$C: So Epic I have goosebumps.
$C: I was not expecting this gif to play out like it did.  I (hopefully) still have a few more years before my child starts to question Santa, but damn this gif left me feeling emotional.
$C: The wide-eyed innocence of a young Tom Cruise has never been put to better use than in this gif.
$C: I have a son, I'm never going to lie to him and say Santa is real.  I'm going to treat it like the legend it is.  People believe in ghosts even when you say they don't exist, so why not Santa?  I'll tell him the *story* of Santa, and even if he figures it out, I can deflect and make him come up with a justification.  "How does Santa get into our house if we don't have a chimney?"  "I don't know, how do you think he'd do it?"  

"Is Santa real?"
"None of us have ever seen the real Santa, how would we figure that out?"

"Do you believe in Santa?"
"*I* don't have any proof that he exists.  I know that the cookies we leave out get eaten and there are presents under the tree in the morning, though."


$C: As a parent on the cusp of having to have this conversation, I’d say avoid it if you can. Problem is very very small kids have a hard time understanding that they shouldn’t spoil it for those children who do believe, so it can create some awkward situations. 
$C: Aw. I have diabetes now.
$C: Aw, son of a bitch.

$C: Fuck. I expected it. I didn’t expect it. And it fucking Dino-walked all over me. 
$C: Well, if it makes anyone feel better, this was me. I knew he wasn't real but I didn't say anything to my parents or little sister so I would still get presents.
$C: lmao
$C: What's the title of the movie? Just scrolled for 5 minutes and not a single comment states the source.
$C: A Few Good Men is my favourite movie of all time.

$C: He'll keep "believing" until he's 24.

$C: Hey there. Thank you for saying those nice things. Sorry to hear you had such a crappy night. Hang in there. Tomorrow’s (hopefully) going to be much better. Happy holidays!
$C: > Today was the 5th worst day of my life

That's kinda fucked up. I mean, I could probably sit down and think of the worst day of my life, but I couldn't come up with four more.

$C: This is 3 hrs old and not one comment?? This is amazing!
$C: Exactly what I was looking for... Santa sees what you do, but he doesn't know what you think or want. Many times we had that from others for various purposes... The significance of the letter would be to put such wants into actual honest realizations
$C: This makes me wondering what others trues is he lying about...
$C: Why didn't you just tell him that Santa can't read your mind?
$C: Santa can see everything, but he can't fucking read your mind.

$C: This was my thought,  too! The son is questioning his dad about the crazy elements of Santa while dad wants him to keep believing. The final question should have been, "You and mommy put the presents under the tree, didn't you?" "YOU'RE GODDAM RIGHT WE DID!"
$C: Intense

$C: A Few Good Men, 1992
$C: Someone’s getting coal for that comment
$C: Yes but not everyone makes the leap to realising Jesus is just Santa for grown ups.
$C: Parents lie to children all the time to let them keep their innocence. 

A mother is upset about a mortgage and a kid asks why she looks sad, should the mother tell the kid she's worried about how to pay for their home, or should she lie and say nothing is wrong?
$C: It is important to allow them an imagination, and this is something imaginative you can share with them... if they learn the truth brutally (ie seeing you eat the biscuits) it can be traumatic, but learning over time and recognising that santa isn't real can be a big step toward adulthood.  It can have a positive effect on your view of your parents although some personalities hate the 'lies'.  Of course, if you teach your kid logic, philosophy and scientific method from the beginning, they aren't going to believe for long. 

tl:dr lots of pros and cons regardless of the direction you take.
$C: I'm sorry :(
$C: Came here to say that

$C: That's why the smart kids never let on that they know - no need to rock that boat and put an end to the sweet gravy train of santa presents. 
$C: When I found out, my mom allowed me to be "Santa" with them and stay up wrapping and placing my sister's gifts. Then I went to bed and they did mine. Mom always gave me an extra sincere smile when I opened the presents from "Santa."
$C: Or switch it up, now Santa brings socks and shit, mom and dad bring the good shit.
$C: YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE SOUND!
$C: I got a gameboy from Santa and a game from my parents. That left me all kinds of confused.

$C: A Few Good Men
$C: A few good men
$C: I only have a script for the 2nd half:

Son, we live in a world that has kids,    
and those kids grow up way too fast.   

How old are you know? 10?  
And your little brother’s what, 7?

I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom.   
You scoff at Santa Claus and you question his existence.  
You have that luxury.   
You have the luxury of not knowing what I know:  
That the Santa Claus story, while implausible, makes kids happy.  
And the gifts that suddenly appear on Chirstmas morning
makes kids happy!  


You don't want the truth.  
Because deep down, in places you don't talk about on the playground,   
you want Santa to be real.  
You need Santa to be real.    


You asked for things like Legos,   
skateboards,   
and a Nintendo Switch.  
You see these things as cool stuff you get for free just by asking.  
I see them as Christmas magic.  


I have neither the time nor the inclination   
to explain myself to a boy  
who rises and sleeps under the official Star Wars bedsheet he asked for last year,   
And then questions the manner in which he acquired it.  


I would rather you just said, “Thanks Santa,” and gently fall asleep.  
Otherwise, I suggest you put on headphones, and ignore the commotion you hear in the living room.   


Either way,   
I’m not ready for you to grow up just yet!   

Is Santa Claus real?   
Well, in a sense, Santa is the spirit of Christmas that…   
Is Santa Claus real?   
YOU’RE GODDAMN RIGHT HE IS.

$C: A few good men. 
$C: A few good men. 
$C: A Few Good Men
$C: Because you were in that dark part of the playground where some kids still think Santa Claus is real. But deep down you know that Santa’s handwriting looks just like your mom’s!!
$C:  [Here’s a link to my original video](https://youtu.be/E44YAoGcIVk) from which I had this GIF created. Say hi to your folks for me!  
$C: A Few Good Men
$C: Happy bday !!
$C: A Few Good Men.  A true classic
$C: A Few Good Men
$C: But he could hear me talking about what I wanted 
$C: Here is my original YouTube video of it: https://youtu.be/E44YAoGcIVk
$C: I just drove past a house that was fully decked out in lights.  This made my night.
$C: I think it's 'A Few Good Men'  I could be wrong that's a young Jack Nicholson so Imdb 
$C: Then you'd have to dub it and you wouldn't be able to get the voices right in your head.
$C: A Few Good Men
$C: I'm not sure if you're joking or not, but 'Twas the night before Christmas/A visit from Saint Nicholas' (where much of the modern Santa story originates) was written over 60 years before coco-cola was even invented. 
That's not even counting that Saint Nicholas (the main inspiration for Santa) lived in the 3rd and 4th centuries, 1,300 years before the first drink was even carbonated.
$C: Sub-par Marine whose behavior is ordered to be 'handled' internally in an unethical manner.

It's obviously a bit more complicated than that. Good movie though.
$C: A Marine was killed accidentally while getting a 'code red' administered to him. Code red is an unofficial disciplinary action carried out by one's peers. Two Marines were being tried for murder. Tom Cruise was their defense attorney. In the scene shown here he's examining their commanding officer trying to get him to admit he ordered the code red and the Marines were just following orders.
$C: A Few Good Men
$C: You don't believe in Santa don't you
$C: I bet you've never heard that before 
$C: A few good men
$C: He he he, you can’t find me!
$C: Existential crisis?
$C: Holy fuck dude. 
$C: Thank god you don't have kids. 
$C: What are you asking? Are you asking why lie to the kids? In short, it's because there is only a small window of innocence in a human life. (in many cases, but not for all, of course) This small window is the only time you'll ever be free of responsibility, and have the ability to ignorantly believe there is magic and good in this world. I don't look at it like we're lying to the kids, it's more like just allowing them to have this small window before it's gone forever. That's a pretty huge gift, and Santa is the one we do it with because he can transcend religion. He's something that's everywhere and he stands for all that is good, magical and so on. He's basically the manifestation of that window. -and by there being presents and the deal with being naughty or nice, he take son a tangible quality, unlike Dora or Mickey. Anyway, it's not my job to tell people how to raise their kids, but in the cases I've come across, once a kid starts getting wise, that's usually the time to dispel with Santa and go more into a pretend scenario, like you have done.
$C: Fuckin' world did you grow up in where you learned of Mickey Mouse as a mutant?!?
$C: Username checks out.
$C: Put that way, this takes on a whole new meaning. Perhaps telling your children that, hey, your parents are responsible for the things you own and not some figment of your imagination might make them appreciate it more.
$C: This gift answers that question quite well: parents want to preserve a bit of Christmas magic for the kids. The parents don't want their kids to worry about bills and adult stuff. They want Christmas to be a fun and magical time and they want that as long as they can, for as much for themselves as for their kids.

Some parents take it too far and attribute every little gift to Santa, of course. Many parents go overboard. But I don't see the problem with saying that Santa brings one or two smaller gifts.
$C: Because being able to believe in magic and wonder is a gift that should never be undervalued, and we should never deprive kids of that chance. 
$C: Cause Santa
$C: I get downvotes for saying this is good? Freaks. 
$C: Kid confronts his father about santa.
$C: So sad that people are missing some good satire here.
$C: I always figured the santa myth helped ease the christian indoctrination of youth. Hey kid, of course you believe in santa, right? Well... let me tell you about God. 
$C: I can't decide if your comment is satire.
$C: Coal is too good for you. 
$C: Because children deserve to have magic in their lives. 
$C: Lol! Listen to the new father and his great plan! Good luck with that buddy, it’s not about what you want anymore. The sooner you give in to the dark side the better.
$C: Are you alright..?
$C: /r/offmychest/
$C: r/thathappened
$C: Okay Mr. Grinch
$C: If people call them Legos in common usage than I think it's an acceptable shortened name for them.
$C: I think most kids know Santa isn't real, we just play along because it's fun.
$C: The world is brutal and kids deserve their period of innocence and fun before they inevitably become like us
$C: Thanks, internet child psychologist!
$C: Sets them up for the first real disappointment in their long disappointing lives.

$C: Thanks for the reminder
$C: Ha. Nice.
$C: Isn't this a thing about the three stages of life?

1)  Believe in Santa  
2)  Don't believe in Santa  
3)  Become Santa
$C: Whoa.
$C: Thank you, for this amazing gift of magic.
$C: we are ALL Santa on this blessed day :)
$C: You either die believing in Santa. Or, live long enough to become him!
$C: Did you just assume my religion?!
$C: Father of an 11yo and 8 yo here.

I’m not crying. YOU’RE crying
$C: Now I am become Santa, the giver of gifts.
$C: I'd rather continue receiving gifts! 
$C: I sure as hell hope not, not everyone wants shitty little kids.
$C: Is that because I watch people le sleep? 
$C: I'm sterile.
$C: Lol there's only one Santa. He comes on Christmas Eve and leaves presents for good children, and lumps of coal for bad children.   
Silly goose.  
$C: You either die believing in Santa; or you live long enough to see yourself become the Santa.
$C: One day women will all become monsters. 
$C: Unless the children in your Life grow up in in Jewish household. Just saying.
$C: I wanted to become a wizard and now I'm Santa. It's something!

$C: Well that's terrifying.

$C: Top Shop.
$C: Yeah that was the only thing. In the original scene Col. Jessup admits to his lie, but in this one he's just repeating it at the end.
$C: But the point of the gif is that he wants his kids to believe in santa not let them realise the world is a miserable broken place. 
$C: I really wanted it to end:

"IS SANTA REAL?"

"YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT HE IS, AND YOU"RE LOOKING AT HIM."
$C: See, I disagree.

I like that it he maintains the lie. It is a good twist. Admitting the lie is pretty predictable due to the source scene. 

Different strokes and all that. Merry Christmas!

$C: Yeah but saying Santa is true follows the original metaphysical and cultural purpose of his existence better.

The vast majority of us in our relevant cultures NEED to keep propagating Father Christmas myth for a myriad of reasons. The fact that Christmas is just so fun often blinds us to those other deeper reasons.

$C: Absolutely, the only thing keeping this gif from being perfect. 
$C: I know, right?! That would have been the perfect ending.
$C: I agree that would have been better
$C: "Did you buy all those presents?" would match the number of syllables in "Did you order the code red?" And as you said, something like that would be a better fit thematically with the original.
$C: What was the name of the original movie?
$C: Agreed
$C: So happy it didnt end like that
$C: So much angst I heard their german voice actors 
$C: I would just like to say that a doctor gave me intraveneous Ativan orally in the ER when I was having a super bad day (like crawling on the floor to the bathroom bad), and I was high fiving nurses. I can see how that stuff could be a serious problem for some people.   
$C: I would love that Santa! Fill up all the stockings so  I can forget the entire time Trump is president.
$C: And there was no sex. Well, not what I would call sex.
$C: Thanks dad
$C: "Have you ever had sex while you where camping?"
"It's fucking in tents!"
$C: Like camping with your mom
$C: Thanks Dad joke explainer. 
$C: Thank you! I couldn't understand it until you explained it. Have my upvote.
$C: Good bot.
$C: Fuck you dad joke explainer
$C: That's fucking in teepees, and that sounds too much like sounding for me.
$C: And they're not fucking
$C: It just kept GIFing. 

Its a long GIF....sorry. 
$C: I can just remember the night I pulled some shit like this in 2nd grade. Fucking tears and snot flying everywhere, begging for the truth... only to be thwarted in my every attempt to find it.
$C: Better than Jelly of the Month Club.
$C: /r/gifsthatkeepongiving
$C: I didn't want it to end, I just knew that it had to...
$C: YOU CANT HANDLE THE GIF
$C: This may have been said already, but I'm so glad I watched the entire thing twice.
$C: It's the GIF that keeps on GIFfing, all year long.
$C: Would have been better if the defense lawyer in the back was the little brother telling him to shut up. 
$C: Giffing. It just keeps on giffing.
$C: Only one I saw I enjoy more is the Darth Vader battlefront one
$C: r/gifsthatkeepongiving
$C: I beg of you, gif wizards please trim this gif to end at "you can't handle the truth" for Reddit gold, I have daughters who would love this!
$C: We never lie to our children, even about Santa Claus, and they're just as excited for Christmas every year.
$C: Seriously. This was amazing.
$C: Point me to something better.
$C: It is great, but still not as great as that video of the man getting hit by a football in the groin.
$C: I liked the, "you're like what 10 now? and your brother is about 7?" 

Could really feel the dad coming through. I remember filling out forms with my dad and him asking me the questions. when were you born? what's your social? how tall are you now? you allergic to anything? 

I'm 10 dad, why don't you know when I was born, you were there and we have had 10 parties for it.
$C: why isn't he in bed?
$C: It was excellent until it said Legos, the 's' that shouldn't be there lets it down.
$C: That actually made me tear up a bit. 
$C: I really wanted it to be "Did you put the presents under the tree?"

"You're goddamn right I did!"
$C: [i want the juith](https://i.imgur.com/581z6P8.mp4)
$C: They come at the end of the year and take gold and upvotes worth of the year
$C: You dun goofed
$C: /r/noisygifs
$C: That's because Jack Nicholson actually said "want" and "need" in the film. Much of this gif is astonishingly similar to the dialogue in the film, which is a big part of what makes it so compelling. An excerpt:

>You don't want the truth, because deep down in places you don't talk about at parties, **you want me on that wall. You need me on that wall.** We use words like "honor", "code", "loyalty". We use these words as the backbone of a life spent defending something. You use them as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide, and then questions the manner in which I provide it! I would rather you just said "thank you", and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon, and stand a post. Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you are entitled to!
$C: [removed]
$C: My favorite part is when he tells dad he can get mommy to repeat back to him what he said. This is good stuff fellow internet person!
$C: And  YOU WANNA KNOW THE TRUTH?
$C: Same.. I wish they would get together and remake this scene to say what the gif said
$C: i turned off blood sport to read it.  totally worth it. my Son is eight now and im dreadimg this conversation.
$C: This x1000, every word and sentence was in the characters voices...i shall now call this movie 

"A Few Good Elves"

$C: Yep. I actually could hear Tom Cruise saying Daddy in my head and I giggled every time. 
$C: I have never seen it and could still hear the voices. 
$C: Same. Sound was even too loud in the end of the gif.
$C: VERY high quality...
$C: yea
$C: A Few Good Men. Although it is an extensive edit.
$C: It's so much better if y[ou've seen the movie \(or the play\), or at least this part, before you watch this version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtpOtFIEkbs). Then you can "hear" it like everyone else is. 
$C: I was seeing this all the time in the OP. This gif ruined that scene.
$C: As if I needed another reason to feel inferior to Jack Nicholson.
$C: "Shining" era Jack Nicholson would've had a different solution.
$C: for some reason my head translated that to,  "pistol whipping" your kid 
$C: And then Code Red-ed the kid in the middle of the night.
$C: " I suggest you pick up a weapon, and stand a post"
$C: murica'
$C: A pistol and a bottle of bourbon. 
$C: Does... does the pistol shoot holiday cheer?
$C: Harvested from the north pole earlier this year. Really impressive taxidermy jobs. 
$C: I'm 30 and I'm willing to believe that he'll drop off presents somewhere else for me.
$C: Meh.  It was easier to just end the whole myth.  The only reason we started the whole thing anyway was because it's what parents are "supposed to do".
$C: Yeah we just said Santa left the presents at Daddy's work and Daddy brought them home
$C: My wife grew up with a guy who got into an argument one day in school about the existence of santa. The guy went home to his dad for some clarification on the subject and the father insisted that Santa was real. So the young man went back to school the next day and put the other kid in the hospital because he was "calling his dad a liar". This young man never forgave his father for not leveling with him when he asked. 

Don't be this mans father.
$C: Or just tell him the truth since its not a big deal at all.
$C: Because Dora and Mickey are creations that they observe - they look at the fairy tale from the side. Santa let's them live *inside* a fairy tale and become part of it, which is more magical. This makes their childhood brighter and more interesting, which is basically what every parent wants to do for their kid. It's like watching a cartoon (observing) vs going to Disneyland (become part of), it's just another level.
$C: Do you worry about your kids telling their little friends that Santa isn't real, and then getting the other parents pissed at you for blowing up their spot? Because I worry about that. 
$C: This is exactly what we did. A couple of times my son has let slip that Santa is pretend and the other kids just rolled their eyes like: "pffft, he doesn't get it".

The only kids that get upset at hearing people claim Santa isn't real are the ones that know deep down it's true.
$C: You don't have kids, do you?

I absolutely had to tell my kids that cartoon characters are not really, they don't need to be scared of cartoon ghosts, they can't hit people like the cartoons do, etc.
$C: Wait what Dora is a mutant?
$C: We did the same. Our daughter is 5. We explained the history of Saint Nicholas, and his secret gift-giving, and how lots of people *pretend* to get secret gifts from Saint Nicholas ("Santa"), but that they're really from mom and dad. We made sure she knows it's a game that lots of people play and their kids don't know that mom and dad really give the gifts, so she can't tell other kids  - not even that it's a game - or it will spoil the game for them. So far she's come to us to tell us how many of the kids in her class play the Santa game, and how the teachers even talk about it, and she seems to think it's fun to know and keep the secret from them.
$C: That's how we treat it in our house. It's worked out great so far. Oldest is 9, knows when I say his behavior effects his gifts, I'm 100% serious.
$C: Same. I dreaded my kid finding out Santa was fake by someone else. Shit he goes to public school and watches youtube. Broke it to him at 7 or 8 so he would hear it from dad. Damn babysitter told my brother and I and my mom was pissed. So I broke it to him. He suggested he was suspect Santa was fake. He's a smart kid so i felt like it was an insult to keep it going any longer. We do the same and still all label some gifts to everyone from Santa. Sometimes even wondering who tf got me this? So in a way it still is a mystery on some things and maintains the Santa feeling. Heck we label some gifts from the pets. :p
$C: I told my daughter this. She forgot about it, and she started believing, again. My conscience is clear. 
$C: My parents must have done this with me because I don't remember believing that Santa was real. We still had fun with it, still had presents from Santa under the tree, etc.. but I knew it wasn't real. I just thought it was a thing that parents did to play pretend with their kids. How could I possibly believe a man fits down a chimney, has flying reindeer, and visits the entire world in one night? Even to my child brain that was obvious fantasy, so maybe that's why I never believed it. The only part I sorta believed was the cookies and milk, since that's plausible, but I was confused at what kind of person delivers at night when we are sleep. 
$C: I... is dora the explorer supposed to be a  mutant?
$C: This is what I will do. It will be pretend. But we'll still have a gift from Santa.

Try to have them not spoil it for other kids, but who knows how that will go.
$C: His therapist says it's better if I stop bringing that part up.
$C: And that’s when you tell your child all about Krampus the next day.
$C: I had a similar reaction as a kid.  It's already weird "he's always watching."  Then you tell me he essentially breaks into the house while I'm sleeping on a regular basis and is unsupervised, unrestrained to do God-knows-what.  It's kind of creepy.  And, especially bothersome if you have trust-issues.
$C: I think it depends on the kid.  Some figure it out early (or need to have it figured out for them early like mine), while some don't.  Others might figure it out but don't tell anyone because they like the fantasy.  Generally by the middle of elementary school they've either figured it out or some jerk in their class tells them anyway.  Ten is fairly old to still believe, but as the gif shows the kid has already basically figured it out and is just trying to logically break it down.
$C: Oldest generally knows but is afraid to say anything.  I figured I would stop getting presents at that point so I never brought it up.
$C: seems paranoid to me
$C: Well I think it's folking awesome
$C: That was amazing!
Great job!
$C: It's OK, boys, Santa has an upboat for each of you . . .
$C: I was gonna say this has GOT to be a creation from one of the cats over at r/highqualitygifs
$C: Is there a version that stops at "you can't handle the truth!!".... its a little long winded and that is a perfect ending point for a quick and easy share.  Great work, it looks awesome.
$C: If you dont mind, could you send me a link for me to learn how to do the same?
$C: Well done.
$C: I am sending this to every Christmas celebrating parent I know. Thank you for this Gif-t.  
$C: You're the best! 
$C: Wow this runs so smooth., gj
$C: Best. GIF. Ever!
$C: You need more golds. Merry Christmas y’all 
$C: How in the world did you do that? I've tried piecing them together in PS and it always crashes
$C: Worth every second 
$C: This was seriously the best gif of all time well done sir
$C: You guys created a piece of art together and you should be proud. This is great!
$C: How do you turn a video into a gif that long with imgur?
$C: Banned for 1 week.
$C: Excellent work - thank you for this 
$C: That was amazing!!
$C: This fuckin lit good job.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Amazing work
$C: How large was the file size of the gif?
$C: This was brilliant. Well done to both of you.
$C: And without a watermark!
$C: Am I the only one who thinks the ending should have been

 "ARE *YOU* REALLY SANTA CLAUS?" 

"YOU'RE GOD DAMNED RIGHT I AM!!!"
$C: How did you make it into such a long gif?
$C: Name checks out. 
$C: How do you manage to upload a gif of that length to imgur? Whenever I try there's always a cap on the time length
$C: I thought that's where I was I'm so confused now
$C: I definitely thought that's where I was when watching
$C: Nah it's not meta enough for them. That's what that sub has devolved into.
$C: It's just text. They might not like it.
$C: Yes, [a silent video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E44YAoGcIVk&app=desktop). I uploaded it to YouTube out of frustration when I couldn't initially create a gif.
$C: The "gif" in the post is literally a video. As it should be.

Reddit just calls mute videos "gifs." And that's fine because the GIF format is vastly inferior for every sort of animation more than a handful of frames long.
$C: Remember when the googly eyes meme was a thing, that was my favorite 
$C: What the fucking hell fuck
$C: That is absolutely beautiful. 
$C: Looks like the Fleshlight on the tailpipe
$C: That just gave me a panic attack...
$C: What is this called?  I need to see more of them.
$C: This incites the most irrational, fear induced panic attack ever in me.
It's something to do with it be playing at extremely fast speeds.

Does anyone know if this is some sort of phobia? I've dealt with this stuff my whole life. It's either if something is incredibly fast or I think of something inconceivably large. I just start panicking in my mind and it takes a while to shake it. 
$C: WTF that was terrifying. 
$C: It was the closing courtroom scene in A Few Good Men.
$C: [full video of original scene from "A Few Good Men."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQbxw6nuRVU)  Literally my favorite movie of all time. SPOILER ALERT - this is from the final scene of the movie. DO NOT WATCH if you have never seen the film. Rent it immediately and watch the whole thing instead.
$C: It's from a movie called: [A Few Good Men](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104257/)
$C: Man, at first I was like "What?  Who the hell hasn't seen this movie?!"  And then I was like, "Oh, wait. .I guess not everyone has seen a 25 year old movie"

But still, go see it.  It's a classic.  "You can't handle the truth" is one of those pop culture idioms that I don't think will ever die. 
$C: its of muller interrogating Michael Flynn.
$C: #YOU WANT THE TRUTH? YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH! 
$C: Jesus Christ jack Nicolson and Tom cruise aren't part of the military. 
$C: Oh great, another kid from the emoji generation who doesn't know a well-regarded film released a number of years before they were born... 🙄
$C: *Long* ass gif.
$C: https://media.giphy.com/media/5uF0PN4Dai6SA/giphy.gif
$C: People call it that get over it
$C: Gfycat won't take videos longer than :60. I tried them, and pretty much every other gif creating site on the internet, with no success before ForkingAwesome did it for me with his magical gif software, or whatever.
$C: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
$C: [Oh yes, daddy!](https://youtu.be/ks2Yfgx35cU)
$C: ["daddy"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVvwcdqGHOw)
$C: And I kinda liked it when a stripper choked me. I’m not sure what that says about me or why I’m bringing it up, but it feels good to get that off my chest.
$C: I thought the black guy played Jack Nicholsons wife exceptionally well.
$C: Ke... keep going.
$C: Tom Cruise.
$C: That subreddit has turned into /r/HighQuantityGifs
$C: It's damn near perfect.
$C: I just watched this 5 times in a row, then went on YouTube and watched the original.
$C: Thanks for the culture !
$C: Nah, I live in a world composed exclusively of bad men sorry
$C: http://www.thebuzzonhr.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/mean-santa21.jpg
$C: That’s Saint Nicholson.
$C: > Also, he sees and hears everything, that doesn't mean he's a mind reader.

Yea, seems like a pretty easy out for this entire concept. Watching and hearing doesn't let you know what they want, unless your kids walk around yelling "GEE I'D REALLY LIKE A SKATEBOARD FOR CHRISTMAS".
$C: Carol in accounting has to confirm the list for accounts payable, then Pepe in logistics has to check the active stock and create an order form. After that, it will take 5-7 business days for the workshop to process and ship, during which a which a bill of lading must be presented to the recipient child.
$C: Why do one have to look this far down in the comments to have someone else say it? Or is everyone else so bad at giving good solid lies to kids?
$C: Right? I get that it was exaggerated to make for good viewing, but a simple "Seeing and hearing alone != knowing what you think/desire" would've solved this in 10 seconds. Well, it's still dealing with a child so probably longer than 10 seconds.

Boy, we're fun at parties, eh?
$C: Slelves.
$C: Exactly! Serious flaw in the kid’s argument right there. 
$C: You wouldn't have seen Arthur christmas by any chance? 
$C: Yep. You can't automatically know what someone wants just from watching them. The two might have nothing to do with each other.
$C: We nick name her Deputy Biscus because she helps reinforce our rules while we’re in the shower, on the toilet or anytime out of eye/earshot. She definitely has a say over her bald things and is hilariously vocal about her opinions. 
$C: He's the one that moves the bloody elf. 
$C: I hope she never doubts that the dog is real.
$C: "This santa's not real business is doing me a heckin concern."

-The dog, probably. 
$C: Every meeting needs a token *good boy*!
$C: The dog is as much a part of the family as the psycho with the scissors. His opinion should be conciderded in all family decisions.
$C: Hums "what's the story Wishbone?"
Do kids still watch that show?  Mine loved that doggie detective.
$C: He was just happy to be there
$C: Of course. He is the real Santa's undercover agent.
$C: Woof
$C: Who doesn't include their dog(s) in family meetings?
$C: Chin wags are important 
$C: impawtant 
$C: *doge
$C: Probably the most important.
$C: I like that a 7 year old that regularly organizes family meetings is considered youg for her age.
$C: Dog probably wanted to make sure those scissors wouldn't be on him next! 
$C: He's a scientific boy.
$C: I was thinking that until I got to the last part, then I decided future mafiosa. 
$C: She’s a perfect example of both a scientist and why we have Institutional Review Boards. Despite her promising initial studies that last one was unlikely to pass the ethics review. Perhaps if she would have started with teddy bear testing then maybe. 
$C: Or someone who tortures people in CIA black sites, is burnt by someone high in the govt and needs to go on the lam, using the skills and has acquired over a life time. 
$C: Yup, science isn't just torturing elves, it's recording the results in a notebook.  She will go on to do great things.
$C: No, they've got a PRESENT scientist. She's got the method down. You don't need a degree or anything to undertake scientific endeavors. Only to be recognized for them. So she already meets all the criteria to be a scientist in so much as she walks the walk and talks the talk. The credentials will come later.
$C: Lets hope she doesnt suspect the dog of being fake
$C: future *evil* scientist.   
They were wise to admit their deception, it was a test.
$C: Perfect for Unit 731!
$C: or military interrogator. 
$C: God, no kidding. Where did she even learn this. That’s adorable. Also a pretty tight design, if you ask me. Of course, a course in experimental research ethics is probably in order 🤓
$C: Not future scientist. Actual scientist.
$C: More likely a Bond villain. Watch for future Christmas requests to include minions (not the cute yellow kind), shrink rays, and secret volcano lairs.
$C: She's the future leader of the rebellion. Cyberdyne's going to send a Terminator any day now.
$C: More like: you've got a future atheist there
$C: Sounds like she's got a future "Makise Kurisu" there.
$C: Assuming she can pass the ethics reviews
$C: She’s a scientist now.
$C: *Current scientist
$C: “I’m going to tell you a truth you can’t refute.”
$C: alternatively this kid tortures small animals 
$C: 11 years Remindme! 
$C: Or serial killer, Either way it’ll be interesting.
$C: Yup, they should expect to have this talk again in a few years about god.
$C: You’ve got a future *mad* scientist there
$C: She already is a scientist! Even better because she does brilliantly what every other scientist dreads: sharing the results.
$C: [Several future careers are open to her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzw1_2b-I7A)...
$C: Or a future sociopath...
$C: It's not scientific method to almost cut off someone's leg to test a hypothesis... 
$C: Or daughter of saw...  
$C: You spelled psychopath in a weird way.
$C: I was going to say serial killer but ok.
$C: Another Christina?
$C: Or serial killer
$C: or sociopath. They aren't mutually exclusive.
$C: The girl tried to torture the elf with scissors. I thin they got a mad scientist over there. 
$C: CIA
$C: Or maybe the next Dr Mengela 
$C: Or a future serial killer...
$C: I think more of an investigative journalist

Edit: fixed sleepyhead grammar 
$C: Some kind of 'tist at least, that's for sure
$C: NCIS. Call her Abby.
$C: No just an atheist. 
$C: Current sociopath though...
$C: Or a future S & M fan.
$C: Josef Mengele 2.0
$C: This isn't science 
$C: So he was spoiled by someone. 
$C: It's not too late to read him the Polar Express and get him a jingle bell without the ball inside.
$C: Me too, in grade 7 (age 12) we had an assignment that asked "how did you feel when you learned santa wasn't real?"

Up until that point I was being wilfully ignorant, I had my doubts and there was plenty of evidence that he wasn't real, but I just decided that in order to keep getting my presents from santa, I just had to keep the faith no matter how unlikely it was.

The best part is that my mom tried to tell me he wasn't real the year prior, but I equated him to God and made it clear that you just had to have faith.

Edit because this comment got way more replies than I expected: yes I am an athiest, I don't know exactly when I "figured it out" because frankly god didn't have as big of an impact on my life as Santa did, so becoming an athiest was more of a passive thing than finding out Santa wasn't real. I suppose it happened around age 12 or 13 shortly after the santa assignment.
$C: My aunt talked my mom into becoming a Jehovah's Witness, so, growing up we had no Christmas... like, ever... Subsequently, we never had Santa or any magic. My kid is now 9 and still believes in his teddy bears, he's mad because his elf drew bushy eyebrows and a crazy moustache on his class photo (the glass part, dry erase marker) yesterday, he wrote two letters to Santa so far and straight up told me "You gotta believe to receive!" a couple days ago... I honestly had no gauge to go off, so, the people here saying middle school is kinda comforting. Keep the magic alive for kids man, it's the best thing.

I also never had a birthday party and have no freaking clue half the time, I try but always kinda worry my parties I throw for my kid suck. :/
$C: I realize this must be so different depending on the country. In Sweden, Santa comes to the house at 4 pm on Christmas eve to hand deliver the presents. I was 4 years old when I saw it was my grandpa in a costume, noticed again when I was 5 when I even gave santa a present and later went looking for it in my grampas house, and found it. When I was 6, santa was TWO very drunk co workers from my dads office. All magic was lost by then and my parents never invited santa over again. 
$C: My parents told me when I was ten I think. I bursted into tears and completely flipped the fuck out, so they wound up telling me that the tooth fairy and easter bunny were still real...

It was only years later that I would think to put a fallen tooth under my pillow WITHOUT letting them know first...
$C: I don't really remember believing in santa, I must have at some point, but I mostly I just figured it was a fun game of make believe.

Perhaps my parents never strongly pushed the idea on me idk.
$C: Man, me too. I just never thought about it. Magic man gives me some free toys every christmas, I've got a good thing going on here.

I was, however, uncomfortable with the arrangement because I'd found out that impoverished children in africa don't get presents so I thought santa was racist or something. 
$C: I only found out because my parents did crack and on Christmas eve I woke up to the sound of shuffling in the hallway. Went into to hall to see my parents unwrapping presents they were trying to find the ones with earrings and necklaces my uncle who lived with us at the time had gotten me. He usually got me diamond earrings since it was my birthstone. Nothing grand, but just a little diamond and gold earrings. My parents didn't even stop when I started to cry, my mother told me to go back to bed and that  Santa would get me new ones. I was five. There was no Santa who would get me new ones. 
$C: Meh, I was a believer in Sinterklaas (Dutch equivalent of Santa Claus) until a late age but don't consider myself particularly slow. I think I was just very naive / trusting of my parents back then, like everything they said was fact. That reveal was actually the wake up call that got me to be a bit more critical. Maybe it was the same for you?
$C: I actually can't remember when I stopped believing. Parents and I never talked about it, just one day they stopped being presents from Santa.

Then again I went by the thought process of showing doubt might short gifts so no sense telling them I didn't believe.
$C: I was 9. Believed so hard that when it was gone I stopped believing in anything. 
$C: I think I found out when I was 10 or something. "Santa" didn't even use a fancy tag on the gift one Christmas that's why I knew he wasn't real. Also, we had this some sort of Advent calendar-ish thing where we would get treats everyday til the 24th and when I got older like 10 or something, "Santa" stopped putting treats in it and my mom said cause we're too old for it. FUCK THAT!!! I feel betrayed.
$C: My dad used the same wrapping paper for gifts from him and from Santa.

Cmon, dad.  Get your shit together.
$C: I mean, when I was 12 I also fully believed I was an elf from Lord of the Rings who had fallen into a black hole which transported me to this earth, and I desperately needed to find my way back, and my best friend was convinced she was a mermaid.... so Santa wasn't too much of a stretch for me. 

My parents told me before I started middle school though because they didn't want me to be made fun of. I cried for a week. 
$C: Are you saying he isn't!?
$C: Well, did you eat a lot of glue before then? 
$C: My cousin was 13 or 14. His parents wanted to keep him as their baby as long as possible and that was part of it. That and he was too stupid to realize it. He believed in Santa, the Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, everything until he was in junior high and about to start high school. 
$C: Am I the only one who never believed in Santa due to an older sibling refusing to play along?
$C: 11 here.
$C: I'm over 40.  Santa is real as long as he keeps bringing me presents.
$C: I was like 7, but then again,  I'm Muslim so I guess that may have had something to do with it.  


(Inb4 r/atheists says something about "now work on the sky fairy") 
$C: Dude I'm 28 and I'm currently in a battle with my mother who is trying to claim that my sister and I should be contributing gifts into stockings this year. WHAT KIND OF SHIT IS THAT??
$C: WTF
$C: Was a little wise-cracking smart-ass as a kid. I could NOT get my mum to admit to me that Santa ain't real. She just refused to say the words.

So one day I got into her office desk drawer and got her notebook out (which I was strictly forbidden to do). There were about 5 "code names" in there of guys she had dated over the years.
I had glanced "Father Christmas" in there before. So, in order to prove my point, I called the number. Someone picked up on the other end, and I heard a high-pitched, female-sounding voice say "Hello, this is Santa's Workshop, Christmas Elf speaking?" or something to that effect.

I stuttered something about a wrong number and hung up, put the notebook where I found it, didn't tell my mum about it, and quietly accepted the Magic of Santa. Now a 37-y-o woman and still believing in Santa(s Magic)!

The weirdest thing about this is that the whole thing about elves working for Santa is an American thing that has no place in German culture (where I grew up) so to this day I have no idea what was going on there...
$C: My step-father was hired to play Santa for a girl (the parents wanted a consistent Santa) every year for a home visit.  Last I heard him speak of visiting them was in her second year of college.  It started as “Awe, it’s cute she still believes” as it went into the high school years.  Eventually it became more of a “... how is this going to end?”. 

I have a near morbid curiosity about why his job ended. Was she just humoring her parents, and finally admitted it?  Did they finally decide to break the news to her after deciding it had gone on long enough?  Did something in college finally make her realize the truth, and how did that fall out?


$C: Some older kid told me when I was 5 or 6 and suddenly all the little things I noticed all tied together. It was like a eureka moment.

I still pretended it was real because Santa gave all the best gifts. 
$C: Don't feel bad. Billions of adults believe there is a God.
$C: Nah, sometimes people/kids suspect that if they ask too many questions about a certain topic, they won't like what they find out. Often this is subconscious.

My daughter is 10. Really really smart kid. She first read the entire Harry Potter series in 1st grade. I constantly find random scraps of paper with scrawled out math problems on them. She's currently working on three different novels she's writing. 

Still fully believes in Santa Claus, and has shown no signs of being skeptical (or she's playing along so well, she could win an academy award).

Meanwhile my 3 year old son sees the elf in a different spot and asks "Daddy, did you move the elf?" He's not necessarily a genius or anything, but unknowingly lives his life by Occam's Razer.
$C: Pro tip: the longer you admit Santa is real, the longer you get presents.

30 years and still going strong. 
$C: I was 12 when I learned what Santa was. I saw him on TV but I never understood it.
$C: I was 5 I didn't tell my parents till I was 14
$C: We do what we must, because we can.
$C: Next on her list of things to go: god. 
$C: >The elf loses its magic from ~~touching~~ *excessive commercialization*.
$C: Wasn't that amazing! She was able to sustain critical thinking and realize she needed confirmation from more than one example. *She took notes!* She knew she uncovered something so momentous that it demanded a family meeting. And that the next logical conclusion is Santa isn't real, either. She could be a good investigative journalist.
$C: She didn't start with the scissor torture technique so it's not *that* bad.
$C: I mentioned in another comment that my daughter is typically very silly and animated, and to hear her tiny little voice speak so adult-like along with her notes caught me off guard.  Don’t get me wrong, she has moments of brilliance and insights that blow me away but even then, she’s my hummingbird who paces and bounces while talking about it. This time, it was very serious and unlike her other presentations. I think it reflects how seriously she considers the idea of magic and Santa and felt it was appropriate to share these ideas more calmly. It also made me realize that she’s not as young as I think.
$C: As a parent, I would be disturbed because I missed a whole investigation, if that makes any sense.

My daughter is 9, but a very young 9. She surprisingly still believes in her elf (Santa has always been more of an afterthought). She has always been intellectual, but emotionally a little immature, and actually goes out of her way to explain away Christmas inconsistencies. (Oh that gift from the Elf is wrapped in the same paper as the gift I wrapped for a classmate? The Elf must be borrowing our Christmas paper.)

If she were to come to me, notebook in hand, with this long list of experiments and conclusions, I would be less disturbed about the experimenting, and more disturbed that I missed it. She is young enough that I (ironically) am confident most of the time she doesn't keep secrets from me, and I pretty much constantly have tabs on her. When she is keeping a secret, at her age, it can be kind of obvious.

So to hold a whole investigation like this, complete with extensive case notes, would disturb me a little, personally. Just because it'd make me feel a little like "what else is she thinking and getting up to that I don't know about?"
$C: cus she tried to cut squints legs
$C: The last one would never get approved by an ethics board though.
$C: She’s basically Hermione at this point.
$C: The 7 year old had been lead to believe that if she touched the elf it would lose it's magic but she did it anyway knowing what may happen.
 She was willing to strip this innocent magical elf of its power because she thought there MAY be a chance it was fake.

She didn't think about what would happen to the elf if the story was real. Even if she did, she didn't care. That is worrisome to me. 
$C: Probably the torture part.
$C: She may be a genius, but she is very unethical.
$C: The only disturbing thing is parents perpetuating a lie to their children.
$C: Ethical approval isn't part of the scientific process. Just a social hurdle.

A more serious issue is that she did the experiments in the wrong order. If it is plausible that touching the elf removes the magic, there's no way of telling whether the subsequent experiments failed for that reason or not.
$C: Asking the important questions here! 
$C: The scissor test is also fatally flawed in that it ignores plants which are both alive and do not stop you cutting them.

Edit: Upon further review, her experiments were successfully able to determine the elf is a plant. It doesn't stop you cutting it, it can move without the use of it's arms or legs, and it doesn't use verbal communication. Plant. Like E.T.
$C: What? Control elf testing what? lol
$C: > Did she have IRB (Institutional Review Board) approval and oversight for her research?

Only necessary if you plan to publish your results or submit them as part of your tenure process.
$C: She should have gone on Amazon and ordered a few more for control purposes.
$C: Quote, "*Mad* Scientist". :P
$C: She’s smart for sure, but she is still immature in other ways compared to her peers. And I don’t say that in a negative way or to imply that I’m constantly comparing her to others. It’s actually what makes her so fun and exciting and interesting. And in a way, it gives her an advantage sometimes when she chooses to let her intellect shine. 
$C: "I explained in another comment: 

Of course I noticed and I removed them, which is what she was calling us out on. She says Squint shouldn’t have been able to get out of the cuffs on his own without help. It was a subtle way of accusing us of moving the elf. 

My son is 3 years old and has been soooo excited  to see Squint, read the story, etc. this year.  This is our first year with elf on the shelf. 

One day during the first week of December, he ran to me sobbing because he forgot not to touch Squint and was holding him in his hands talking to him when he suddenly realized he accidentally took away Squint’s magic. He was DEVASTATED. 

After I calmed him down, I told him that it’s okay to touch Squint, but he can’t carry or move him away from his spot because if Squint gets locked or stuck in a drawer, toy or toy box, he can’t fly out to the North Pole to report to Santa. He has to be out in the open in order to fly and needs to stay where he was found. He’s been very, very careful and precise about this. 

So when I saw the pipe cleaners, to ME it looked like my son was playing with Squint but couldn’t get him to sit upright on the bathroom faucet in the same position he was in that morning - a balancing act that took me a few tries to keep him seated without slipping off and into the sink. So I figured my son grabbed a pipe cleaner from the craft supply box and wrapped it around Squint and the faucet to keep him steady. 

"
$C: Maybe reddit has made me too skeptical, but I asked the same question to myself and it leads me to believe that the whole story is a big stinky pile of BS. 
$C: A totally normal occurance in OPs house.
$C: I thought the same thing 
$C: Yup, exactly my thought too. Made-up story, or at least severely embellished.

Because if the parents saw the pipe cleaners, wouldn't they have immediately incorporated their own "Look what happened to the Elf because you did that" routine?
$C: What is wrong with your dad?! Why didn't he just eat the whole cookie like a normal person.
$C: My mum sends me Christmas presents every year and when I call to thank her, she always pretends that she never chose those presents, Santa gave them to her so she could send them to me.

I always forget that that's the deal too, so every year I respond with "Oh yeah of course, how silly of me". 
$C: Just curious, what do you do now?

Also, high five from a fellow Wheel of Time fan.
$C: I explained in another comment:

$C: id fund her research, let me just get my volcano lair ready. 
$C: Is there no plastic elf rights committee that she could go to instead? ;)
$C: She does not. I’ll check it out, thanks!
$C: I stopped believing around 7-8 but under no circumstances would I let my parents know I knew under fear of them stopping the santa presents. I waited until my youngest sibling stopped believing to admit I had been lying for years.
$C: Well...... how'd it end? 
$C: And how did you manage to move the elf while avoiding the camera?
$C: My research advisor told me that research must also be very boring or else it isn't science
$C: You really want this kid to start experimenting with moving the dog's spirit into her brother?
$C: Sid's poor toys!
$C: The elf knows no limits and fears naught but Santa.  Cower mortal before your better and lay your evidence bare for you will now be judged!
$C: Well clearly if this is true, she didn't inherit the brains from her parents. 
$C: The dog isn't real
$C: Unfiltered children can be surprisingly dark sometimes.
$C: This is absolutely true of many of the elves I've dealt with in the past.
$C: He keeps an eye on kids, makes sure they're not being bad. They "move" every night to a new position. That's proof that they're real I guess. This seems to have really caught on over last several years... I dont remember this from my childhood, early 80's...
$C: I got a decent toy microscope when I was 7 or 8, and I loved that thing - it was the perfect gift for me at that age. I could examine endless samples of whatever I could get my grubby little hands on, and it also taught me about optics and how to handle fragile things (and especially how *not to* handle them, haha).
$C: Edgy
$C: What was Siri's answer?
$C: WAIT WAIT WAIT I GOT IT!  What are you researching, ELVES?! tss tss
$C: That was like me, but for religion. I'm still not sure how many adults would have actually encouraged me to read the Bible cover to cover, if they knew "God" was so pro little boy murder and little girl kidnapping.

Once all their defenses turned out to be either sociopathic, offended, or requiring a kinder God who didn't care to set the record straight, the game was up.
$C: And now I'm left to wonder if and/or when those two become mutually exclusive
$C: But she didn't cut him. She was bluffing.
$C: Yep she'll be under a three letter acronym in no time.
$C: My son is 7 and in first grade.  Alot of 7 year olds are in 2nd grade.

FWIW, they've been teaching the scientific method at my son's regular ol' public elementary school since Kindergarten.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Lost me at "she's a young 7 so she still believes." Um it's normal for kids to believe well into like 4th grade. 
$C: /r/nothingeverhappens 
$C: I'm glad someone said it. Unless this is a child prodigy, it didn't happen. 
$C: We will never know, but is a fun story nonetheless.
$C: /r/nothingeverhappens 
$C: Don't just do science and math. I say that as a CS major.

You need balance. Everything is useful training material, specially to a young child. Painting, colors, music, counting tiles, telling stories. Sorting screws, measuring flour in a cup.
$C: Idk, I hate PUSHING kids, especially that young into any field. Sign her up for extra after school classes or camps and if she's into it that's great but the act pushing her might just push her away and make her hate it. 
$C: She’s the polar opposite of a cruel child, so I don’t think therapy for this experiment, at least, is necessary. I said I was a bit disturbed at first because to know her and hear that still-tiny voice describe her experiments with adult-like stoic authority caught me off guard. She’s typically my spaz hummingbird who will randomly blurt, “it’s quiet. Too quiet;” followed by screaming and flailing her arms and legs. That moment was just so UNsilly! lol
$C: Lol, this actually sounds about right for a seven year old girl.
$C: Idk man, the shit I used to put my GiJoe and HeMan toys through? I should have become the Unabomber ... Turned out just fine. 
$C: Why? She's perfectly sane if she realized that Santa is not real.
$C: She already had concluded from the previous experiments that the Elf wasn't real. The last experiment was just to create irrefutable evidence. There is nothing psychotic about threatening something you've already determined to be an inanimate, lifeless object with bodily harm.

If the scissors thing had been the first experiment, it would be different.
$C: She stopped before cutting, she's fine. I probably did worse and none of my victims ever complained. Well not in voices you could hear.
$C: > Have you thought about therapy?

Was that wrong?  Should she have not done that?
$C: Are serious?  Therapy for what?  
$C: Bribing, threaten to maim an elf. Sure, OP should be very proud.
$C: Ahhh. That indeed was the one. We had a good run for that hour, we made it to the front page for a glorious minute. My reddit career since then has been hit and miss lol. Thanks, stranger! 

$C: Oh man, Imma adapt the quote and use it at my next IT meeting.
$C: Not really, but I was getting into a couples costume we were doing and I had to hem some pants into shorts and it was just a funny thought I had.
$C: Yes, for some reason, I must know

Offensive to women, perhaps?  I don't see why it would be deleted
$C: Your guess is as good as mine. It said it violated the meme rules. My best guess is that it didn't have a line of text on top and bottom. Sounds dumb, but that's my best guess.
$C: clearly not you. Dodged a bullet there.
$C: As a Dad, when my kid asks me for something at the store I say, "What? You think I can afford that?" When it comes to birthdays and holidays it makes the kid appreciate the gifts more.
$C: Two in a row, in the wild?  What da hell?
$C: My thoughts exactly.
$C: I don't know why a kid still old enough to believe in Santa needs their own laptop.
$C: Well, it is not like some $1000 laptop, it is one of those 2 - 1 flip things, and IIRC, it cost me like $300 or maybe $250 to get.
$C: What's a computer?

Wait, I fucked that one up.
$C: A kid with a laptop not knowing Santa isn’t real might be even more strange imo. 
$C: Teach him about Hanukkah Harry.
$C: You sound like a fun parent
$C: > But we’re also Jewish so there’s that.

lol... wait a second, why are you celebrating Christmas?  I think I'm confused...
$C: The credit is "thanks Santa" the effort is "Santa will put you on the naughty list".
$C: "Santa isn't even real. It's time you learned more about your heritage. Let me tell you about the Chanukah Zombie."
$C: Christmas may be a Christian holiday but Santa is more indicative of the secular aspects of the holiday. He's more "yule log and holly" than "Jewish kid in a manger and some smelly shepherds".
$C: Elijah did it.
$C: That's evil... ^^you ^^might ^^be ^^my ^^kid
$C: Guys actually read it, I think this is a joke. Especially about the trillion dollar gift giving balloon
$C: Thanks for the pasta!
$C: > with the same amount of presents all the time

ouch
$C: Did you by any chance post on fark.com as "Pocket Ninja"? Because this reads *exactly* like a Pocket Ninja post...

Regardless, well done.
$C: Got about 2 sentences in and realized it’s pasta
$C: That's some tasty /r/copypasta!
$C: seriously! How does an exposé of this magnitude only have four updoots
$C: Given the situation, that would be super awesome.  He lives 2 hours away, so I only get to see him every other weekend and extended on holidays and extended during summer.
$C: Well, it wasn't a virgin birth, that's for sure.
$C: >Daughter says "That's it, Santa's real, Mom would kill Dad if he bought this!" Mom puts on a smile and says "Yes she would!"

Hahaha, that's beautiful!  Yeah, old age had me forget his biggest reason for thinking Santa is not real, because he made the logical conclusion about one guy bringing a few million kids presents in one day.  He obviously gets his smarts from grandpa...
$C: ... shit... you might be right.
$C: Deer fucking word... that's... brilliant!
$C: hahaha... how can you beat that logic?
$C: Since that thing happened, some people are just writing "spez" instead of "edit" for the fun of it.
$C: It would go with the Father's day gift he got "me" a year years ago; Minecraft (his favorite game at the time).
$C: > They all report back to the mastermind Santa in the North Pole of course who looks like traditional santa.

If this is an R rated action thriller then where do I buy my movie ticket?
$C: Some people usually from TD use it in place of the word "edit" iirc. 
$C: Yes.
$C: > It's nice to see that you maintain a (apparent) good relationship with your ex

Lol, yeah, about that...

Really, though, everything is about the kid, so, yes, all about the kid.

>it does appear that he has a great father.

Thank you!
$C: Right... mother of my child, the lady who gave birth to him.
$C: I am doing one hell of a job with that... in that case he will think I am Santa until I'm dead.
$C: > Fucking kids these days.

I try to avoid that, and let that be handled by my Alabama senator and my national Subway spokesman.

Exemplifies the difference between truth and fact.
$C: Same. Some other comments are shitting on that part, but it was my 100% favorite. Made the gif that much better for me.
$C: Hey! They did noticed my comment!
$C: What movie is it?
$C: Exactly 
$C: Santa kills Dumbledore
$C: I'd accept that. At least it's SOMETHING. >:(
$C: Nooooooooooo!!!!!!
$C: Better than not getting any explanation at all.
$C: Damn kids these days, getting on Reddit and they ain't even old enough to know Santa is as real as the sun that rises in the morning
$C: I don’t think he’s talking about the movie
$C: FIVE YEARS?  Christ... I think 6 months after a DVD release is more than enough. 
$C: I'm sorry. 
$C: Even my immediate family bought it.
$C: We're all just contracted now. The brand recognition is too strong to elicit true eye rolls anymore.

$C: Haha thats awesome. Yeah its a great show, i really appreciate when writers of kids shows make them enjoyable for adults as well.
$C: This is my 3.5yo daughter.

"I'll have some to-mahh-toes please mummy."

"No, it's not Zoe Zeee-bra, it's Zoe Zeh-bra!"
$C: We allowed my 5 yo daughter to start watching Youtube videos when she was 2 and Peppa Pig was her favorite. We are Filipinos and spoke Tagalog at home, but when my daughter started to have conversations with us, she used British English and had the accent as well. 

When she went to school at 4 yo, she was awarded most proficient English speaker and we're just so proud of her. This was all due to her watching Peppa Pig. The only problem we have is that she barely knows any Filipino words, so she might have some issues next year when they start studying the subject. 

She can understand Filipino well, but when she speaks, she mostly use English with a mix of the few Tagalog words she knows. She also has a more neutral accent now that she doesn't watch Peppa Pig that often.
$C: Thanks fam
$C: And his comment got 4... somehow...
$C: Parting gift it seems... kind of ironic.
$C: Thanks
$C: Especially since he's minus five days old.
$C: My parents' (and thus I suspect many others) philosophy was "if the kid asks, whenever that actually is, we'll tell the truth".
$C: I reminded them that I had my own presents that I bought that needed wrapping.  They're only 4 & 5, I'm not looking to ruin the magic of Christmas for them just yet.  I don't even think they realize that they figured out the truth about him.
$C: Yeah same here. My parents would place gifts under the tree through out the month of December leading up to Christmas and it was established they were from them and then on Christmas morning we’d wake up, run to the living room, and see what our one big most desired present was that Santa left, and it was always unwrapped. Hell im 26 and now I only ask for like 1 thing and if I spend the holidays with them they’ll leave out one present in the living room before I wake up. 
$C: It's stupid long and at no point did I find it funny
$C: No i'm glad it's happening
$C: I'm really curious right now... how did you even find my comment?
$C: Now it’s 19... it’s growing
$C: Thank you 
$C: lol I upvoted half those posts when they were new. I should smoke less weed. 
$C: That's right, and once we figure out to start moving forward from core drilling it's over for all you hoes 
$C: Santa is always subordinate to Jesus. He put five across the face of a guy who argued against Jesus’s divinity.


$C: Lying to your kids is never acceptable.  In your example, the kid already knows something is wrong; if you lie, it breeds distrust and doesn't alleviate the kid's concern for their mother (actually, only makes it worse).  It doesn't mean you tell kids the entirety of everything, but she could say, "I don't like these bills" or something.
$C: >  It can have a positive effect on your view of your parents although some personalities hate the 'lies'.
   
Yup. When I figured it out I was pissed and held a grudge. I was told to always be truthful with and respectful to my elders... and then they straight up lie to me so they feel good about the holiday. When I lied I got yelled at or spanked but when they did it? There was nothing I could do to them. That shit stung.
   
If I ever do have children I won't be teaching them this. Its one thing if they come up with their own imaginary friends and such but I certainty won't be the one putting it in their heads. 
$C: Who knows, I haven't seen them since I was in 2nd grade.
$C: good bot
$C: Thanks mate
$C: Thanks! :)
$C: Thank you.
$C: Thank you and that was fucking brilliant

$C: Thank you

$C: Thanks!
$C: Thanks, yeah I'm an idiot when it comes to these kinda plots.
$C: He gets no presents.
$C: This is going to the all time highest posts so yes
$C: That's my point 
$C: I don't either the way you put it

$C: 1) be jewish
2) create christmas
3) profit
$C: Yup, 3 am after mass building a jungle gym, doll house or drum set... Sigh
$C: I’m pretty sure there’s a couple more stages.

1) Believe in Santa
2) Don’t believe in Santa
3) Accidentally kill Santa
4) Get super fat(er) in a matter of weeks
5) Become Santa 
$C: Thanks for reminding me I'm in the last stage of life
$C: My wife was telling me last night, "you know you're santa now right?"

I was in shock. I mean, she meant I was santa for our 1 year old puppy (we don't have kids) but it felt good knowing I'm freaking santa.
$C: 4) You look like Santa
$C: Amazing gif of magic 
$C: Or die bitter and alone like an unredeemed Scrooge.
$C: r/brokengifs
$C: Gold!
$C: Surprisingly addicting
$C: You bought a website domain just to host that gif and the personal view counter?  You must really like that gif.
$C: It's old...and it goes.  Go-old...GOLD.
$C: Someone makes a post, they're given Gold, they say 'thank you kind stranger', yadda yadda yadda!
$C: So, you play Barnes, summon a Blood of the Ancient One...
$C: Man just not getting the humor... was really tedious for me.. really and I'm very easy to please with humor.   I'm 53 years old.... is there some generational thing that makes it ironic?  Is there like a 'dadsplaining' genre ?
$C: that's amazing. There was no Gold when i posted that comment. I think Banya has special powers on the eve of Christmas....
$C: Top what?
$C: still not clear on which tier it is
$C: I was about to upvote, but then the .gif got to the part where Tom Cruise makes his case, essentially "if Santa sees and hears everything we do, why does Santa need a letter telling him what we want?"

How do these logically connect?

The next obvious move would be to say "He can only infer what you want from what he sees and hears you do. He can't read your mind."
$C: Thanks! Yeah its cruising 
$C: What's the record upvoted one?
$C: Son could have asked "is santa clause fake?" Or "did you lie about Santa?" And then we get our admission
$C: Also his logic doesn’t hold up - Santa can see everything we do, yes, but he can’t necessarily read our minds. He knows if we punch our little sister, but he doesn’t know our hearts’ desires. And even when it comes to behavior monitoring, he has to keep a list - and the fact that he checks it twice implies that he sometimes makes mistakes. Writing Santa a letter is just common sense if you want to make sure you get the things you want. 
$C: I think I prefer the twist ending. 
$C: But he does admit to his lie, Santa is real because HE is Santa. But he's still leaves the interpretation of the statement up to the kid.
$C: Santa is real bro
$C: I didn't hear it German until you said that, then I pictured it as that Hitler meme from awhile back, with the advisors and the war planning etc. 
$C: Oh yeah, definitely don't anyone think Ativan isn't actually serious stuff. FYI Reddit, neither Santa nor I are promoting Ativan!
$C: Daddy
$C: Where's /u/DadJokeExplainer when you need him?! Ummm... or her?

\*sees it's #2 on /r/all from /r/HighQualityGifs\*

Oh my...
$C: GIF... as in "gift." Pronounced correctly. This animated image is testament, incontravertable. And I'll hear no more of this "jif" poppycock. 
$C: It just kept on GIFTing,

Like Santa ...sorry.
$C: the Gif that keeps on giving?
$C: What a pitty the G is pronounced like a J
$C: Jifing?
$C: Would you say it was a...Gifmas Story?
$C: We had a debate at the lunch table. 3rd or 4th graders basically putting out the reasons Santa might not be real. 

"Well my older brother said our mom and daddy buy the presents."

"Your older brother is a dumb butt. I think Santa is real because my older sister, who is older than your brother, said he is."
$C: I pretended to believe way longer then I should have just because i knew I got more presents than my older siblings that way. Right up until my mom was hollaring at my dad for being drunk on Christmas eve saying, "This might be his last Christmas that he believes!" to which my dad replied, " It fucking should be he's almost 17 years old"
$C: My daughter still believes in Santa at that age and this year I'm dying my hair white and dressing up as him. Hopefully she'll see me if not I'm going to show her our "security camera footage" of Santa leaving presents.
 
I want to see if I can keep her believing all the way into college.
$C: I'm already not a fan of lying to your kids about a creepy, fat old man but if parents decide to, shouldn't they at least tell their kids the truth when they are old/mature enough to question the reality of Santa? 
$C: We find these truths to be really and truly fucked. Now go to bed. 
$C: Sarcastically. You're God damn right
$C: I'll wait
$C: *Inside* the groin? How’s that work?
$C: Mom knows your age, likes, dislikes relationships, hopes and dreams!

Dad is vaguely aware of some little people in the house.
$C: My father once seriously asked me if I had ever had a blood transfusion while he was filling out a form for me. I was about 12 at the time, and just gawked at him after he said it. That's something you wouldn't know about, seriously? 
$C: My dad is the same way. And yet he is so much better than my mother in every other way imaginable yet she still has an encyclopedic knowledge of my milestone dates (birth, when I started grade school, immunizations) and health issues (allergies etc)...
$C: When my husband takes our kids to the doctor he calls me to ask those same questions. It’s maddening. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Went to a car exhibition with my dad when I was a kid. We had a long discussion about my age at the counter because he insisted I was 5 (free entry) and I, with the typical child’s honesty, insisted I was 6 (reduced entry) instead of just shutting up. Obviously the ticket sales person assumed my dad just wanted to sell me out as 5 to save a few bucks so we ended up paying the kids rate.

5 minutes later I realised my dad was actually right. 
$C: "I'm working on it." Sounds just like every dad I've ever known.
$C: Me too. The whole GIF did. It's funny but also heartwarming and kind of sad and nostalgic, all at once. Dammit, what an amazing GIF!
$C: Great of you to transcribe.  What film is this?

Edit: it's *A Few Good Men*. Thanks, guys.
$C: So, as someone who essentially has never seen a single movie made prior to 2004 if it wasn’t made by Disney, what...uh, what film is this?
$C: > astonishingly similar

Let's pump the brakes a bit. OP did a good job of syncing overall, but it was not astonishingly similar. Plenty of it had no overlap between the text and the characters' mouth movements.
$C: Dont forget the perfect *either way*
$C: The original clip is how trump-ettes like think of themselves when arguing with liberals.  
$C: What utter crockery.  What happened was, his back healed on its own over the course of 13 weeks, as injuries are wont to do.  It’s great to have a good attitude, sure, but “what made the body can remake the body?”  Sir, you didn’t think your fucking self into existence, and you’re promoting a very reckless course of action for people in extraordinarily precarious situations.  This is when “The Secret” goes from nice in theory to actively dangerous.
$C: What utter nonsense did you just link to?
$C: /r/gifsthatkeepongiving
$C: That's enough Reddit for today. Goodnight
$C: Did you just advertise at me?

$C: Is this guy a Jedi? He meditated and found his spine and willed it back into place? That sounds pseudoscience but it's true! Incredible

$C: Wow. Dude followed the Gavin Free philosophy of deciding not to be sick, and it actually worked. My mind is wrinkled.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Holy cow. Did that really happen? Is it abnormal?

/u/ThatAtheistPlace, It seems if doctors said he'd never walk again, it's more than just simply his "back healed on its own over the course of 13 weeks." Not if the doctors were saying never again. That means, they did not believe he would be healed, "on its own" or not.

He didn't think himself into existence, but the bodies of his parents created him. I thought he was alluding to that: human physiology is capable of building a fresh human being, so certainly there's something in our bodies that would also let us heal a broken one. I don't subscribe to woowoo theories, but medical "miracles" are always very interesting insights, not only in those who receive the miracle, but those who perceive it.
$C: Elfew Good Men
$C: Hold up, I thought high quality gifs had to talk about how high quality they are though. 
$C: Thank you! Couldn’t figure out the name. 
$C: That's daddy to you.
$C: As if I need another reason to give my kid a pistol to sleep with.
$C: PS it was Jack sneaking into your house, ask your wife for the truth. 
$C: I get it, but you ever notice jack Nicholson can never be anyone but jack Nicholson? I see him I don't see the character he is playing I see jack Nicholson. Unlike say Clint Eastwood who has a very signature iconic similar look, when Eastwood acts I don't see Clint Eastwood I see the character he is portraying. 
$C: I started to feel like that when he sang "I'm so pretty" to Adam Sandler and did it in a more manly fashion than any heavy resistance training I have ever done.
$C: 1989 Jack Nicholson would've shot the kid.
$C: It's time to take your medicine! 
$C: Roque mallet.  
$C: You can do that too. It’ll put him out for the night without telling him Santa is fake. Win-win. 
$C: >pistol whipping

$C: They may be stuffed, but their soul is magically trapped in their immobile carcass to telepathically report on the children they spy. Occasionally they manage to summon up enough muscle control to blink and wet their eternally dry and burning eyes. So watch for that, kids.
$C: Elves? Nope. Chuck Testa. 
$C: He leaves mine in an Amazon locker 
$C: There in your neighbor's house, you just have to go get them.
$C: your kid will now ruin it for the other kids at kinder/school :D
$C: I think having Santa as a fun myth of Christmas is a healthier thing for a kid than believing that it’s real. I just don’t get why people work so hard to maintain the whole ruse. It’s fun, but if your kid questions it, they should have their logic met with honestly. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Yeah, that's not gonna be a problem. Some kid putting another kid in the hospital? Sounds like there are more problems than just a belief in Santa. 
$C: Neither is not telling them and allowing them to continue having a childlike sense of wonderment around the holidays. 
$C: In 2007 both my parents were unemployed but they scraped and saved to give my sister and I a good Christmas, knowing it would likely be the last one where we believed in Santa. 

Except then they got the idea to make it seem like Santa had been scared off by the dogs and left, so all the presents were wrapped and in this beautiful red satin bag in the fireplace. 

We believed until we were fucking 14 years old after that. $10 at bed bath and beyond bought them several more years of keeping the fairy tale alive. 
$C: Bologna. My daughter has known the truth since day one, and she's over the moon thrilled about Christmas. I don't recall my childhood being as bright as hers, and my parents did lie to me about Santa.
$C: Thank you. Agreed wholeheartedly.
$C: Seems like a bad idea to lie to your kids though.

I know it's normal but something being normal doesn't mean it's necessarily ok. My parents always just said Santa was pretend but I remember a lot of heated arguments between kids about it in 1st and 2nd grade. A lot of legitimate confusion, I just kept my mouth shut.
$C: And if they wanna continue with the fantasies when they're older, they can always become religious 
$C: Just wait until VR hits......this will change overnight.  Kids wont be observers, they will be actors.
$C: And what happens when they realize you’ve been lying to them.  Being able to trust your parents seems more important to me, but fuck me right?    
EDIT: Yea I guess it’s fuck me then.  I’ll stick with being honest with my kids.  You go ahead and keep lying to them.
$C: Kids aren't dumb. They know Santa isn't real. They can figure that out for themselves.
$C: I got in a *ton* of shit for that, as my family flat out never did the Santa thing.

$C: To be fair the other parents could just make up another lie about how your kid is crazy or was bad or something like that...
$C: Not OP but we never did Santa.  We didn't have tons of money when we had our first kid, plus we figured when we did, and if something happened and didn't again, how do you explain the gift situation, plus I hate lying, like in my core.
  
So we never did, we also made sure they understood that many love it, many kids dont' know and to pretend with other kids it's real if they ask or talk about it.  So far 11&9 they haven't ruined it for anyone else.  
  

$C: I figured out that Santa wasn't real when I was 5-years-old. I said it out loud around a 4-year-old and he went crying to his mother. His mother called my mother and I got a stern talking to. I was very confused about why I would get into any trouble for simply speaking the truth. The same thing came up when I was about 12 with my ~4-year-old cousin when she brought up God. My aunt and mother were not happy.
$C: My parents never did the Santa thing either. I knew of his existence, but more of a jolly mascot of the holiday where I get to pick a present.
I realised later that this same "mascot" was this magical thing to other kids at school and was really sad that I missed out. 
However I still dutifully wrote my letter to Santa in class and helped to preserve the secret for other kids because I didn't want to spread the sadness, and also it made me smile (and feel slightly smug) to see the other kids excited.
$C: Other parents can eat my shorts. It's not my problem if they choose to lie to their kids, and my kid is the one telling the truth. Their lies are not my responsibility.
$C: Do kids go around saying Mickey Mouse isn't real? Or Spiderman? It's pretty easy to keep your kids from "ruining" it for other kids. Let them know it's a fun game to play, and talk to them about not telling other kids the truth.
$C: Who the fuck cares? This is the stupidest, weirdest tradition... It's a magical time of year  because of people's generous acts, not because of a fat red consumer fairy! Why do we need to lie to kids??
$C: You just have to make it clear that it is important they don't tell other kids. I think most kids will understand.
$C: for me I just got bullied by the santa believers for it. It's like if you went to a monastery and told them jesus is a lie the pope made up.
$C: Do you remember being a kid? Why is it even a problem? 
$C: Idk I guess i never really actually believed he could do that it was just part of a song, at least i think its hard having perspective on it now that its been 20 years. My brother was an asshole and showed me that the S in Santa matched the S my mom used when writing her christmas presents. Santa is different for everyone

$C: There are a couple of great After Effects plugins like GifSquid and GifGun. Plus some decent stand alone converters like Gif Tuna and Instead InstaGiffer.
$C: DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT use the actual GIF format for anything except icons on the web. In case that's what you wanted to do.

The GIF format is 30 years old now and it's awful for anything animated these days. This post would be like 500 mb instead of the measly 18 it takes because it's actually a video.
$C: You have to make it a gif fine first. Imgur only supports mp4 uploads of 30 seconds
$C: [MAGIC!](https://i.imgur.com/OFX8R1g.gifv) Just kidding, some After Effects plugins
$C: ;)
$C: There's a time limit to mp4 uploads (30 secs) but gifs. Both, however, have to be under 200MB. That, then, lies in the compression of which there are several tools. If you want check out the high quality gifs sidebar and there is a link to our Discord, we can help walk you through things more easily there
$C: [deleted]
$C: > out of frustration when I couldn't initially create a gif.

Get yourself [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/).

These are the three lines of code you need for high quality gif:

    FFMPEG -i input.mp4 -vf "palettegen" -y PAL.PNG
    FFMPEG -i input.mp4 -i PAL.PNG -lavfi "paletteuse" -gifflags +transdiff -y output.gif
    DEL PAL.PNG

For long content, you usually want a vp8 video however:

    FFMPEG -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx -b:v 500k -an -threads 7 -auto-alt-ref 0 -pass 1 -passlogfile 2PASS_ -f null -
    FFMPEG -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx -b:v 500k -an -threads 7 -auto-alt-ref 0 -pass 2 -passlogfile 2PASS_ -y output.webm
    DEL 2PASS_*.log

Increase the `500k` for videos with large resolution.
$C: Did you have Adobe premiere at your disposal? You can export projects as a gif
$C: Great job. I actually got emotional during it. Santa Magic is real.
$C: Thanks! Even if it's silent, just being able to pause it is helpful. A lot of those lines, especially when the argument got heated, flashed by too quick to read.
$C: And see, this is why we need to get rid of net neutrality. The shackles that keep businesses from streamlining clearly got to OP, making his time burdensome. Let the free market play out. I for one will love when I can create, without hassle, a 3 minutes gif of me fucking the neighborhood dog's unwilling butthole. Some things just are better if you know you can share them easily with the world. 
$C: Someone needs to dub this.
$C: Amazing! Well done. 
$C: That is soooo much better.   Shame on you for even wanting to turn that into a gif.  (good job on the video, perfect fit!).    See now I can go back if i didn't read something quickly enough.   Video > Gif  unless its a silly cat and only 5sec long.
$C: From now on, I'll call videos 'noisy gifs' and call gifs 'silent videos'
$C: If you could supply me the script I would love to attempt the voice over. I could supply each line separately and you could layer it in. Although I don’t know how well it would sync up. 
$C: youtube is good so I can watch it on half the speed and pause easily
$C: Why didn't you just upload the video to gfycat? What you posted was not a GIF, it's an MP4 video. And I hope to god that no one put it through MP4 -> GIF -> MP4 conversion, because that would just be stupid and lose quality for no reason.
$C: You must have enough gold to last all of 2018
$C: Reddit needs to try to get this dubbed over by The two actors. If they aren't already, this would make them immortal in the eyes of parents long after we are all gone

$C: This is a fantastic film definitely give it a watch.
$C: It's so interesting how hard it was for me not to lip read Jack Nicholson's lines. He enunciates so deliberately!
$C: Cannot updoot enough - fantastic movie that earned its way into the annals of film history and rightfully so. Endlessly quotable and entirely enjoyable to watch
$C: Thanks man! Will do immediately, I think my dad actually has the movie.
$C: > Rent it immediately

That shows your age more than the fact that you have a 10 year old kid does.
$C: Never seen the movie. Watched the video anyway. No rules. 
$C: I love this movie, and this scene gives me goosebumps every time I see it. For anyone who’s seen the movie, [WWE did a parody of this scene back in 2005](https://youtu.be/osRl7ARQ1Eg) with John Cena and JBL that I thought was surprisingly well done. I’d love to see a good parody using this Christmas script.

Edit: Found uncut video.
$C: Any idea if it's on any streaming platforms? Hilarious work btw! 
$C: this is really one of the best movies of all time, tom cruise and jack nicholson knock it out of the park
$C: Rent it?  

Don’t forget kids, be kind, rewind. 
$C: I have only seen that clip and I am not a drama person but damn that scene is awesome on its own and I am sure watching it will only make it better
$C: Never seen the film, watched the clip. Looks good. Do you want to give me a very succinct explantation to the ending of that scene 
$C: Thanks!
$C: Oh shit its actually a line from the movie?

lmao, I didnt know that.

And yeah, im actually a 19 year old college sophomore. This movie is 6 years older than me.
$C: Touché
$C: >*Peoples call it that get over it*


$C: Wait, what else are they called...?
$C: Hmm, that's odd because this is a video that's longer than 60 seconds. There must be someway to circumvent the normal upload restrictions.
$C: Roll tide
$C: I don't think Santa likes you doing that sort of thing though.
$C: Me too man, I was totally weirded out but totally into it. I always thought I was the only person who is been choked by a stripper. Just goes to show.
$C: > the black guy 

You will address him as Colonel or Your Honour. I'm quite certain he's earned it.
$C: I envy you now that you will get to see this movie for the first time.
$C: I hope you watched it immediately, otherwise you're doing yourself wrong.
$C: **EEEERRRRRWWWAAAAAAAEEEEEE**
$C: I’m sorry, do yours not? Fuck. Mine are broken, I want a refund. 

Edit: Punctuation. 
$C: Pepe Silvia is in LOGISTICS?


$C: Obvious exaggeration aside for the sake of the video, it's a thing of being put on the spot.  It's easy to forget logical, simple answers and you start floundering.
$C: Then the kid could speak his list aloud and Santa would be able to receive the info. And most kids do tell their parents aloud what gifts they want, so the letter should be redundant. I agree with the 10 year old. 

But saying Santa has billions of kids to bring gifts to, so needs the lists as reminders is a satisfactory explanation. And there's corroborating evidence in the fact that he keeps his own list for naughty and nice. Has to check it twice, in fact.

$C: When I was a baby, our family dog was a valuable member of the parenting team.
$C: You think he'd ignore partially hidden treats?  You think he'd let her put scissors over his legs and not wiggle or bite?  That dog definitely passes the living tests.  He probably helped to co-author the study by showing what actually sentient beings do when under those conditions.

$C: The last one? none of them would have passed. 

The first experiment? She completely failed to first obtain signed informed consent forms from the elf. 

She completely failed to do a risk analysis considering the possibility of harm to the elf including but not limited to the risk of said elf permanently losing their magic, the risk of said elf falling off the shelf and being hurt in the course of being moved or the risk of the elf suffering paper cuts from the informed consent forms. 

*It just gets worse from there.* 

Imprisoning a research participant without informed consent? 

She offered "treats" the the participant but completely failed to fill out any risk analysis into the possible effects of said treats on the elfs health. Was the elf diabetic? Might the elf have substance abuse problems, there's the possibility of them selling the treats offered and using the proceeds to buy drugs! in which case any overdoses would be the fault of the researcher. 


Her research notes pertaining to the subject were not stored either in a certified encrypted manner or in a certified physically secure location, just think about the harm that could have some to the elf if her research notes had become compromised and others learned the movement patterns of this elf!

*Even without the last experiment the IRB would have thrown her plans out entirely.*

Cynical side note: if you were to sum up the total harm caused by all the worlds IRB boards by simple means of useful and reasonable research that simply never gets done and significant harms that remain part of the status quo because it so massively massively balloons the difficulty of doing any useful research that could change the status quo.... even subtracting out the harms they prevent between them they'd likely have more corpses piled at their feet than the nazis. But they mean well. They have good intentions.

"On the Real-ness of Christmas Critters"

Abstract: In this ground-beaking study, a simple test-statistic is developed to determine whether the broader population of Christmas Critters are real, i.e., whether they display qualities of real-ness consistent with the behavior of known real-things. The utility of this test statistic is that it can be easily applied to captured Christmas Critters such as Shelf-Elfs, executed rapidly over a short time frame consistent with the pre-Christmas period ("Advent") and executed with readily available household materiel.


Background: Many things update their geolocation, but it is important to separate true motion from other categories of geolocation updates such as pushing, pulling or falling all of which require external actors or or other physical forces such as gravity. True Motion is restricted in this study to the category of geolocation updates that are proven to be the result of self-determination in response to a stimuli with the intent to accomplish a task. 

Hypothesis: Shelf-Elf isn't real.
Experimental Methodology:"Real things move". If Shelf-Elf does not move, then Then Shelf-Elf isn't real. (an attempt to prove the contrapositive).

Attempts to restrain motions of the Shelf-Elf 

1. Case I:  Remove Movement Magic by touching. Observations: Movement observed despite reports to the contrary that touching eliminates motion.

2. Case II: Restrain Movement Magic by handcuffing. Observations: Movement observed despite obstacles placed in path of ordinary locomotion methods.

Attempts to elicit motion of the Shelf-Elf

3. Case IIIa: Attempt to Create Motion by emotional appeals such as bribery. Observation: Motion observed, but not in directions that imply conscisous decisions to move. (No observations in suggested locations, no removal of bribes, et cetera)

4. Case IIIb: Attempt to Create Motion by emotional appeals such as fear. (Credible threats of bodily harm). Observation: No observed motion under circumstances when real things would presumably move.

This study was developed using a novel four-part methodology. Two parts were intended to prevent motion, yet motion was observed. Two cases were intended to elicit motion in a pre-determined fashion consistent with independent decisions to update geolocation. The results in this case were mixed - some motion was observed in the first case, but not in the second. Data observed in the third case would suggest that any perceived motion by the Shelf-Elf is not the result of conscious decisions to update geolocation in a pre-determined fashion. This observed motion is not consistent with motion patterns in observed real things which respond to threats and bribes.  It is consistent with motion of unreal things which do appear in locations not previously occupied but only as the result of external actors.

Conclusion. Shelf-Elf motion is inconsistent with motion observed in real, animate objects that execute pre-determined geolocation updates in response to both threat and bribery stimuli. 

Future Work: The results of the study on this sample population of Christmas Critters is promising. Having determined that Shelf-Elf Motion is not consistent with motion observed in known real things, the study team is eager to extend this methodology to the broader category of Christmas Critters (Flying Reindeer, Sugar Plum Fairies, and even Santa Claus himself). The rareness of known observations of the latter make direct observations both expensive and elusive yet the success of the study based on current member of the Christmas Critter group, and the reliability of the test statistic would suggest that that the investment of additional funds to continue this useful line of inquiry would be justifiable.

$C: I agree. She's there already. I would be bursting out with pride. 
$C: > No, they've got a PRESENT scientist.

I was simply thinking precocious little punk child, but I mean that in an admiring way. ;-P
$C: But she didn't have a control group. 
$C: I bet she will spontaneously develop Russian accent soon. And ask for a severe looking bobcut.

And once there is a boy in the picture, it will most likely not be a boyfriend but an *underling*. Possibly with a German name.
$C: Subject Squint will know be known as Log 42
$C: So many nativity scenes with legless baby Jesus in her future.
$C: it is if you write it down. for example it WAS scientific method to cut off a leg due to gangrene to maybe save the subject. In the past they werent sure it would work until they tried it. 
$C: Don't hold kids up to adult standards. They are learning, and 90-99% will learn to be sociable.
$C: science

noun

the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment.

Sound like science to me.

$C: But she sure as hell has an analytic mind for a 7 year-old, though. She came up with some very clever tests to find out the truth.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I found out when I was around ten, and kept it going till I was 15 so I could get 2 presents (1 from parents, 1 from santa). Still haven't forgiven my sister when she told mum 
$C: >but I equated him to God and made it clear that you just had to have faith.

About that, um.... you may want to sit down for this.
$C: I kept it going until I was 15, when my parents had a sit down with me and told me Santa was a terrorist. I have absolutely zero idea where they were going with that, but I ended up admitting I had already known since I was 11 and kept it going for extra gifts. What tipped me off was that I saw my grandma wrapping a sweater, saw it under the tree on Christmas, and she said it was from Santa and he needed her to deliver it to me. I didn’t behave (kinda) for a year to get a turtleneck. 
$C: Haha I told my parents Santa was real forever, I never stopped. They still write from Santa on my gift every year. It all stemmed from when I actually decided Santa wasn't real instead of asking my parents I went to my older brother. He told me that as long as I claim to believe in Santa we get better presents. Eventually they caught on that we were full of shit when we said we believe in Santa, but it stayed hilarious.
$C: Wow, when even your parents tell you Santa isn't real and you still believe in him, that means you REALLY need something to believe in. Sucks for you to find out that way...
$C: The parallels between Santa and deities seem so painfully obvious I wonder why people scoff at kids for believing in Santa but still have faith in a god. *They* are naive children, what's you excuse?
$C: What age were you when you figured out that god wasn't real?
$C: I like the way your teachers decided that no 12 yr old should still believe in santa by assignment.
$C: i was the same way, all my friends told me he wasnt real and they found where parents hid presents etc but i just wanted to believe, i wanted him to be real.. So i kept believing... i am now in my late 20s and santa is fucking real you assholes!
$C: So how did you feel when you learned God wasn't real?
$C: When I was 4 I found my older sister’s baby teeth in a box by my parents bed. Decided within 5 minutes that the tooth fairy, Easter Bunny; Santa and God were all not real. I hadn’t even lost a tooth yet... can we trade?
$C: This does make me wonder how many kids had an atheist awakening when they found out Santa wasn't real.
$C: How upset were you when you found out God isnt real?
$C: now tell me how you feel about God.
$C: You aren't writing this from inside a cult or mlm right now, are you?
$C: "God didn't have as big of an impact on my life as Santa did" lmao I'm dying
$C: [Relevant Penny Arcade](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2010/12/24).
$C: So much of life is this, doing your best when you don't have a clue, and we always think it's not good enough.  Maybe your parties do suck but with an attitude like that I really doubt it.  At the end of the day you're trying and while that may not be obvious or important to a child when they grow into an adult and look back they won't be able to thank you enough for it.
$C: > "You gotta believe to receive!"

Keep him away from televangelists. ;)
$C: Dude same. Not because of religion but I don't know why, I  never believed in Santa. My family even tried to convince me. I kinda wish I did though. It's part of the magic of being a kid. 
$C: As long as you're trying, I am sure your kid loves the parties. Even when my birthday party was just going to Round Table and playing arcade games, I was having a blast and felt special :)
$C: No, the people in here saying middle school are way out there in my opinion. I've never heard of a kid beyond elementary school believing santa. I think around the time when the random boners start (for me around like 11) that santa stuff should probably have already stopped.
$C: Yeah, much like with horror movie monsters, it's much easier to keep up the suspension of disbelief if you never see him.
$C: That sounds... much harder to keep up. What happens if grandpa's dead, do parents hire a Santa impersonator?
$C: Bahahaha I'd have loved to see the TWO person santa. 

"I thought you were going to be the reindeer this year!"

"I'm always the reindeer! This year I want to be Santa!!"

*Proceed to a fight between two Santas while a crushed sueca looks on... slowly eating the plate of ~~cookies~~ lies that he set out for santa.*
$C: I'm not sure I ever really believed. Apparently when i was three my mom and teenage sister asked if I wanted to visit santa at the mall and I said "I don't like sitting on stranger's laps." They tried to convince me that santa had lots of helpers this time of year because he was so busy and I was just not buying it. 
$C: How old did you lose your last baby tooth?? 
$C: I think I was in or going into 5th grade when I found out, and I flipped out too.  My mom was clearly not expecting that reaction, so she started backpedaling and saying she was just kidding and that she couldn't believe I fell for it lol.  I do kind of wonder sometimes if it's bad to build up this whole amazing fantasy to only take it all away at some point.  I'm already thinking about how I can best tell my kids without them getting so upset too. 
$C: Out of interest, are you religious?
$C: Science! 
$C: I stopped believing in Santa at some point between age 4.5 and age 5.5. I distinctly remember wondering why Santa's elves would put the Fisher-Price logo on  my Rescue Heroes.

I had vague understanding of how much of a logistical impossibility it would be to visit every house on the planet in a single night, even with all the magic. I don't recall having an alternative explanation for where the presents came from, but I kept on marching up to my parents and *demanding* that they tell me that Santa wasn't real. They kept just responding with the infuriating line of, "Well, what do you believe?"

Apparently they were afraid of me telling other kids. I remember my 2nd grade class's Christmas party, where we watched The Polar Express and each student was given a bell. Supposedly you only hear Santa's bells if you believe, and I was so sick of all the Santa bullshit that I was ringing it during the party and yelling that my disbelief wasn't keeping me from hearing it. That was what finally got my parents finally admit that they were Santa.

My older brother didn't even question it. He was told during his first year in middle school, and took the news pretty bad. Whereas I stopped believing as a kindergartener.

My brother majored in biblical studies and once claimed to have spoken in tongues. I've ended up an atheist. I'm glad our liberal christian upbringing had a bit of that "well what do you believe" attitude towards faith. Different strokes for different folks.
$C: *hugs*

What a crushing story :(
$C: That was the first time I remember being really lied to. And it was my family! Oh I was so hurt. I remember being so crushed that they would lie to me for so long, but I think it also made me more critical too for sure!
$C: That's how I figured it out! Ma asked me to go get something from her room, and I saw a massive pile of gifts. Next day, all those gifts were from Santa. I LOST IT.
$C: Only one gift a year is from Santa in our house, and it's the one by our beds. In an attempt to keep us in our rooms and occupied on Christmas morning, my ma always put one gift we could play with by our beds. 

It didn't do much to keep me in bed, I was way too excited about presents and candy. But I still appreciate that every year Santa brings that one gift for me :)
$C: For a few years now my brother, ma and I switch off who does the main stocking stuff. But we all pitch in silly little things to the other two stockings. 
$C: Kind of reminds me of those shows where parents reveal the kids are adopted, but the kids are in their 40's or something! Always made me feel so thankful that my ma told me I was adopted at a very early age. 
$C: I'll always get presents, because my ma is obsessed with Christmas and NEEDS to give us gifts. Every year I say "I'm good, let's just not do gifts" and she claims she "got me something small." 

Cut to Christmas morning when she's spent hundreds on crap I don't want or need. I love her to pieces, but I don't need gifts!
$C: For the good of all of us except the ones who are dead.
$C: We never stop to consider whether we should. 
$C: Then: society's pathetic "laws".
$C: It wasn't torture as much as it was "BITCH I WILL CUT YOU" either way she really kept that elf in check
$C: Yeah I was kind of waiting for "I hurled a glass full of bleach onto its face, and it didn't scream in agony or anything!"
$C: then I peed in the elfs mouth.... No living thing will let you pee in its mouth.
$C: Yeah he should only worry if moving forward EVERY experiment ends in scissor torture. 
$C: Several years ago, I met the General Manager of a place for a bit at the end of an interview.  He gave me a sheet of paper and asked me to write down as many uses for a screwdriver as I could.

I very, very carefully and deliberately left things like "Stab people with it" until way down in the list at a stage where it would be obvious I was grasping at straws.  Even though I thought of them fairly early on.
$C: Wait so she's 8?
$C: Wait until she starts on religion...
$C: I mean, if she's that serious about uncovering the truth about Santa, maybe she'll become that serious about discovering about other things. Try and push her towards a STEM field, she sounds like a neat little scientist.
$C: Your daughter sounds adorable. Also, when I was three I stood up on the end of my bed and asked my mom, in a serious tone, if Santa Claus was real. She said "no" and that was that. I still thought Xmas was awesome until I outgrew the gift part. I'm honestly not sure why people feel the magic piece is necessary. 
$C: _Other presentations_ ? What other myth has she busted?
$C: That's perfect for seven. She's able to be analytical, but prefers to be a kid. We'll ajusted, but will grow up to be really intelligent. You don't want an overly analytical seven year old they will grow up with issues.
$C: There have been "other presentations"?  
$C: Yeah your daughter is now possessed by the elf. Call santa to help you out. 
$C: Don't forget to tell her there is still magic in the world. 
$C: That’s along the lines of where my thoughts went, too!  I started to wonder if her diary contained other little experiments and such.  I don’t read her diary and I won’t as I feel that kind of privacy is extremely important, but I still wondered.

She and I are very close and she tells me everything (or so I thought), and is actually really bad about being discreet, quiet or sneaky. She’s the kind of kid that whispers a secret in your ear loudly or if she sees/hears me trying to distract her little brother or surprise him, she’ll blurt aloud, “ooohhhh! I get it! You’re trying to...” And let’s the cat out of the bag with the least subtle wink I ever saw. lol

So, yes. You get it. And it just took a moment for me to remind myself that this attempt at independence, testing, and exploring are healthy and normal. It wasn’t a matter of feeling threatened at ‘losing my baby,’ but rather, my heart skipping a beat wondering if I’ve been too distracted and haven’t been giving her enough attention to notice these experiments that was most concerning to me.

But at least she didn’t do a pointless one like I did as a kid. I used to get my ass beat for making potions, wasting all my parents’ toiletries and stinking up the house for a day.
$C: I knew positively that Santa was fake at 5, confirmed at 6.

Too many helpers and never a single elf.



I NEVER admitted it.  NEVER.

You people don't count, btw.
$C: >goes out of her way to explain away christmas inconsistencies

She's rationalizing, not thinking rationally. If you don't teach her the difference now n her childhood she'll never grow out of it and will become an anti-vax flat earther conspiracy theorist flax-milk drinker.
$C: Ah OK I see, you're saying OP is a bad parent?
$C: I think the point is that the elf kept moving even after she touched it
$C: That would have been a hilarious way to shut this down.

"Wait, you TOUCHED HIM?!?!?? YOU KNOW THAT RUINS THE MAGIC" 
$C: E.T. was a plant?
$C: All kids, and all people, have their own strengths and weaknesses. I think it's great that as a parent you can identify her weakenesses and nurture her strengths, and that's better than a lot of parents. Good on you.
$C: That’s adorable. 
$C: People can't even make up believable stories anymore. Sad.
$C: Think Santa can eat all them cookies? He has a schedule and a fighting weight to keep. A nibble for politeness and on with the schedule.
$C: For me it's that Santa would put the glass and plate in the kitchen and wash them, leaving them in the dish rack to dry. 
Then when I was playing video games my mom or tell me "if Santa has time to do the dishes than so do  you"
$C: It's supposed to leave some proof that Santa was there. Though, my dad just left large crumbs behind instead of a single bite mark.
$C: That reminds me of my roommate. According to Hungarian tradition the equivalent of Santa is 'Little Jesus', and he brings the presents and the Christmas tree on Christmas Eve. So the guy didn't want to help decorate the tree, and he refused that Little Jesus does not exsist. His parents put up with that until he was eighteen.

$C: Now that I have kids of my own there's been an implicit acknowledgement that adults do the Santa gifts. I think this year was the first time she admitted it, haha. We're visiting her for Christmas so she asked me if I was doing Santa gifts for the kids or if she should. But before this year she would always call me on Christmas asking if Santa was good to me, and I would just go along with it.
$C: Now that you mention it, I probably did too
$C: Psch. That's easy. The camera won't work in the dark, the elf moves in the middle of the night. So just turn off the lights and then move it.
$C: EdwaaArd.....
$C: We have a fake owl that we do the same thing with to scare squirrels.  

I like how similar they work.
$C: To me, this would hasten the not believing in Santa, if kids draw from deciding that the elf isn't "real" that Santa isn't, like here. I believed in Santa as a kid but the elf sounds like the kind of thing that I just wouldn't gone for when I was little.
$C: I'm all fine with the whole elf moving and keeping an eye on the kid for Santa to make sure they're behaving. What drives me nuts are the parents who insist on making the Elf do mischievous things around the house like make messes. Why make my more work for yourself by creating messes, first of all? And secondly, the entire point of the Elf is to make sure your kid behaves, so why would the Elf be going out of its way to throw toilet paper everywhere? Sorry for the rant, I just needed to get that off my chest. I don't get why that all the sudden became popular, the elf literally comes with a book that entails its purpose and pranks/messes  is not one of its duties.
$C: My family did it in the early 2000s but we were the only people I knew who did. My mom got the idea from a friend of hers. This was before Elf on the Shelf, so they were just called our elves.
$C: Something along the lines of "Santa is a fictional being, who is told by parents to children as a bringer of joy, Christmas, and presents." She's 12 now, so it was a few years ago. (And whole family now uses Samsung lol)
$C: Yeah, after the whole Santa thing I pretty much ignored stories of omniscient beings that watched what I did every second of the day. They probably shouldn’t have broken my trust if they wanted me to unquestionably believe.
$C: Bingo. Even if true, this is where the Mom and Dad messed up. She touched the elf. Game over.
$C: Calling r/thathappened
$C: Of course I noticed and I removed them, which is what she was calling us out on. She says Squint shouldn’t have been able to get out of the cuffs on his own without help. It was a subtle way of accusing us of moving the elf. 

My son is 3 years old and has been soooo excited  to see Squint, read the story, etc. this year.  This is our first year with elf on the shelf. 

One day during the first week of December, he ran to me sobbing because he forgot not to touch Squint and was holding him in his hands talking to him when he suddenly realized he accidentally took away Squint’s magic. He was DEVASTATED. 

After I calmed him down, I told him that it’s okay to touch Squint, but he can’t carry or move him away from his spot because if Squint gets locked or stuck in a drawer, toy or toy box, he can’t fly out to the North Pole to report to Santa. He has to be out in the open in order to fly and needs to stay where he was found. He’s been very, very careful and precise about this. 

So when I saw the pipe cleaners, to ME it looked like my son was playing with Squint but couldn’t get him to sit upright on the bathroom faucet in the same position he was in that morning - a balancing act that took me a few tries to keep him seated without slipping off and into the sink. So I figured my son grabbed a pipe cleaner from the craft supply box and wrapped it around Squint and the faucet to keep him steady.

$C: Right, that's why they never expected her to figure it out yet.
$C: What? You doubt a seven year old can chair meetings, conduct experiments, document detailed findings, and present a convincing thesis? r/nothingeverhappens
$C: That is 100% correct! To will notice that an involvement in STEM does not exclude in the arts
$C: You will notice that I explicitly say "if she's interested".  I actually completely agree with you.

$C: I'm a little slow on the uptake today what exactly does it mean?
$C: Why was it removed?
$C: At least you had a Reddit career. I’m still toiling away in obscurity searching for the prefect witty response to break free. 
$C: You're trying to have a "reddit career" by attempting to earn fake internet points? I'm not usually one to judge other people's life choices but I'm having a really hard time seeing the appeal..
$C: Get a life karma whore 
$C: Yeah, with me it was, "Do you deserve it?". And I would simply say "no" out of shame for even asking. 
  
But you bet your sweet ass it felt amazing saying "yes" after getting good grades or whatever. 
$C: Santa doesn't get the good gifts in our house.  Fuck that guy getting credit.

$C: Genius. Its going in my notebook
$C: Just be careful with that one, knowing my parents financial situation at a young age and being told “we can’t afford that” really made me freak out as a kid, eventually I stopped asking for gifts all together because I assumed “we can’t afford it”, even if it was something like new clothes or shoes that needed to be replaced because they were full of holes, now as a broke adult my parents just realized that at 24 ive been wearing the same shoes since I was 12 ( I didn’t grow much) and asked me why I never asked them for new shoes.

So it’s nice that they’re more grateful for the gifts they get but just be careful to not make your kids feel guilty about asking for things 
$C: As a kid growing up though it gave me a really skewed view of how much money we had.

I constantly thought I was wasting money or something if I asked for money for anything. I could never ask for that three pounds to buy a bus ticket because I lost it.

At holidays I constantly thought I wouldn't get anything, or mum had got some scary amount of money from somewhere just to buy me that present. Sometimes I thought we couldn't go to gigs because they were expensive, then she was like "No. That's cheap".

Now whenever I ask if something's too expensive and she says "you should never worry about money, it's not your problem. It's mine." I always think in the back of my mind "well you made me do it"

EDIT:
I'm telling anyone how to raise their kids, or that they should just buy all their kids all the shit they want. It's just that little remarks like "do you think I'm made of money?" Stay with children for a long time.
$C: You're like the rich grandpa in "Greed".  You test your kids by making them take care of a grumpy old bastard.  The only one left gets all your money then you start being kind to them.
$C: Yeah and it might give them a complex.
$C: Me too. But Santa does not get any kudos from my hard earned cash oh no....not happening. 
$C: Stealing this
$C: [deleted]
$C: Whole reason I commented 😁
$C: Or why a kid young enough to believe in Santa also stays apprised of their parents’ financial situation. Idk, it’s sad.
$C: How else is he going to email Santa his wish list?
$C: Actually, I am attempting to figure out how a kid with his own laptop is able to *not* have figured out there is now "actual Santa."

Since, you know, there *is* a Santa... and it's me.
$C: I know a guy with an 11-year-old who still believes in Santa.
$C: "What's a ~~computer~~laptop?"


$C: Or the Holiday Armadillo
$C: Paging u/HannukahHerschel
$C: My parent's called the Hanukkah gift giver "Hanukkah Henrietta" and she managed to ring the doorbell.  
I still haven't figured out how my dad managed to rig that up to work. 
$C: "On Moische, 
On Herschel, 
On Schloooomooooo!"
$C: For real. My gf is Jewish and we’ve discussed it. As long as it doesn’t have to involve Jesus ( fucking fine by me) then she’s fine with me messing with the kids for a few years. 
$C: You figured that out all by one comment? Well done. 
$C: Because pretty much everybody in the west does. Christians seem to think its a Christian holiday for whatever reason, but atheists, Jews, Muslims, whatever celebrate it in only marginally lower proportions than Christians. Over 1/3 of Jews will put up a Christmas tree this year
$C: I sincerely hope this is not a joke and that this dude has just fallen way too deep down the rabbit hole. That would take this from good to great.
$C: It's /r/copypasta fuel, mmm, mmm, mmm...
$C: It's a moon conspiracy copypasta that I tastefully seasoned to make it into a Santa conspiracy.  I've never heard of fark.
$C: They really saved me from myself too. A six foot long toy aircraft carrier would have taken up way too much space in my room at the time. I had bunk beds back then and I'm pretty sure it would have taken up one of the bunks permanently. The Hiss Tank fit nicely on a shelf.
$C: Ah, makes sense. Thanks.
$C: I grew up with divorced parents since I was a baby, I'm in my mid 20's now, but, i was that kid, you know? My mother had custody, and, I really, through all my childhood and adolescence, kinda missed having a father at home, but only because my mother severed my relationship with him, kinda turning the guy as a monster and creating barriers.

I'm just happy because, this doesn't appear to be the case. I know you had your reasons to split, so everything can't be roses, but, both of you seem to try at lest, to make things right for the kid.

Sorry if I'm touching a soft spot, but your boy will need you. He really will. Yes, he can make it on his own, but, even if you're poor, it doesn't matter, you're just his hero, and will ever be.

But i think you already have everything covered.

I'm saying all this because, your story actually relates to me, I love my dad, I know he did everything he could too, sometimes, it doesn't work. But I believe you will make it work. I really do.

$C: I believe it happened in nineteen ninety eight, when The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table. 
$C: Gotchya! Thank you!
$C: Haha, no, this is better
$C: First you have to open the door. 
Then you have to get on the floor. 
$C: As a child my philosophy was to never ask. Who would want the Santa gravy train to end?
$C: Somewhat related - we're getting my daughters ipod touches for christmas (mostly so they'll stop asking to use our phones). I told my wife I want those to be from us and NOT santa... I want the credit for those in particular, haha. 
$C: Withholding the truth is just a different form of lying. I truly hope you change your mentality when you are a parent, because sacrificing a bit of your own moral code for your child's wellbeing is a something a parent may have to do. In a world with increasing ways for kids to be stripped of their innocence too early, do parents really need to start doing it?
I have never in my life lied, and justified it with "Well it's ok, because my parents lied to me about Santa." 
$C: Didn't they teach you about white lies too?  Lying can actually be beneficial to a society... at least thats what I remember getting from reading some random study.  But yeah, fairness matters.

I used to be horrified by parents who refused to support the Santa Regime.  As I get older, I accept that there are lots of other ways to bring up your kids.
$C: Bitch, handle your downfall with grace

Edit:- **Thank you Redditors for downvoting this poser**
$C: Thanks! I was afraid that I was going to be downvoted for that one.
$C: God is an anagram for Dog.
$C: Oh, you're serious.  As a former Christian, I can say Santa had no impact on my eventual atheism.  And to alter your comment for clarity:

>they don't go back to God, they give up on believing in anything *without evidence*

While that would be wonderful, I don't believe that happens much either.  There probably is a good reason to dislike the Santa myth, in-as-much as it is used by advertisers to promote unchecked consumerism and waste.

$C: Children tend to say what they want for Christmas out loud at some point, (Santa Listening) but Mom and Dad don't always have a pencil laying around, so they get their kids to write it down, especially since children tend to say they want 100 times the things that they will eventually write down. This is especially true since decent kids want all the other kids in the world to get toys too.

$C: what a pity that either will do.
$C: I think it would be healthier if you broke the news to her instead of a dorm roommate.
$C: Obviously I'm biased, but I am proud that my kids *never* asked me if there was a Santa. Now that they're adults of course they know the truth, but there was never a "that moment" - the whole thing just gently faded from reality to myth. 
$C: I hate lying to my daughter about Santa but honestly it helps whenever she starts acting bratty.I'll just say Santa's watching you, you better be good or you're not going to get any presents. I even have a Santa Claus soundboard I use to act like I'm calling him.. She's three so she's very gullible.
$C: You must not be a parent yet? I/we, (my wife and I) have said a many of things before having kids on how to raise them, only for those ideas to be thrown out the window in the face of the reality that is having kids and having to explain everything to them. Sometimes, you need an extra nudge to get them to conform to your expectations of being civil.  That and to keep some of their innocence alive before they have to come to the realization of the shit show that is the world now a days. If that involves lying for a decade about a fat man implausibly sneaking I to our house but once a year, so be it. 
$C: I probably did have the maturity honestly, I've always been a bit of a truth seeker/scientifically oriented. I imagine it was partially because my sister didn't know yet either (although older, less questioning). I think they really just wanted me to enjoy the "spirit" of Christmas without question the semantics, but they should have realized that it was a losing battle. I remember feeling relief when I finally had confirmation of the lifelong bamboozle.
$C: [removed]
$C: What I did was follow my kids questions with more questions so that they answered their own question.  My middle one found out bc he fell asleep on the couch and I left him there to sleep and he had lost a tooth that day and i forgot so when he woke up he was looking for money under the couch cushion. The he yelled at us for lying to him. He was tore up .   If I were to do it over I think I’d let Santa just be a cartoon or a fun story like Jack Frost or other winter stories.  Not messing with their sense of reality. But I get why ppl do it 
$C: My son still doesnt know and he’s 25.
$C: Me either, but try getting society to respect your wishes and leave that shit alone- christmas decorations everywhere, the images of santa on every fucking corner, the general hype and fanfare surrounding the occasion is virtually unavoidable; the worst is when you have already alienated yourself from your extended family as the weird people who "don't celebrate christmas just to be different", the schooling system comes along and performs a full indoctrination without your knowledge or consent and in a heart beat that fat bastard has infiltrated your home. I now await the moment when I have to unwillingly break my daughters' hearts.

TL;DR santa is a money grabbing prick, don't trust him with your kids.
$C: Lying to kids is pretty fucked up. Lying again when they call you out on your bullshit seems to me to be a recipe for disaster. How can they ever trust you when they know for sure that you will repeatedly lie to them?
$C: That's like drinking with your 15  year old just because they want to know what it's like and you don't want them to find out at a freshman party. Sure it's safer but is it really the moral thing to do? 
$C: Melodramatically. That was **FABBULLLLOUSSS**.
$C: Ambiguously, I couldn't agree more.

$C: And he's very confused about them eating all of the food he likes, but refusing to eat the food he's trying to get rid of, so he and his wife don't feel like they made Brussels sprouts for nothing. 
$C: Probably my favorite comment in reddit ever.

This is literally my parents, BOTH sets of grandparents(rip to all but 1) and will definitely be me in my household.  The only thing I don't misplace is food
$C: Dad is aware that there are some little people in the house because they keep touching the thermostat and leaving the lights on in the house.
$C: Often, I forget my own age, hopes and dreams!

Seriously, I often forget what my age is. I have to do current year minus birth year. If the dad forgets the birth year, then it's something else.
$C: Mom has to pick up their prescriptions every month or so, and has to rattle off a birth date to do it. Not to mention every time you make a doctor’s appt. 

Edit: in retrospect, my family “tradition” of having kids on or near holidays is super helpful. All you have to remember is the year. I was born on St Patrick’s Day, my brother on Thanksgiving, my oldest on the same day as my brother, and my youngest on July 2nd. Hmmmmm.....
$C: Little bits.....
$C: Ah yes stereotyped roles haha let us celebrate friends
$C: someone keeps eating ALL THE GODDAMN CHIPS!!
$C: that's exactly how he felt when you mumbled out, "i don't know." 
$C: He asked me how to spell my middle name once, I am a jr., we have the same name dad. He also always forgot no allergies, how hard is it to remember none. It occurs to me now he may have been doing this for my benefit, but I still think he was just more concerned with keeping me alive than general info. He also had me figure out tips at restaurants, remember the shopping lists, things like that so he may just have a lazy memory.
$C: that's because he knows he doesn't remember b-days, so he assumes you won't. in the future just give him a heads up about yours to return the favor.
$C: I wasn't sure what note he was gonna end on.  It was perfect.  Lol, just watched it again.
$C: It's called "A Few Good Men." It's based on the play of the same name, written by Aaron Sorkin, the writer for The West Wing and The Newsroom, among others. The story follows Tom Cruise's character, a lawyer in the US Navy, as he investigates the suspicious death of a marine under the command of Jack Nicholson's character. It's a truly fantastic film, nominated for four Oscars. I cannot recommend it enough! 
$C: A few good men

$C: I think we strayed into giving OP credit for something that we should really be giving to Jack Nicholson. 
$C: I wish he could have worked Wall into since it's so distinct in Jack's lip motions.

Here they come 
$C: > you didn’t think your fucking self into existence

Nah man, I think myself into existence every morning. And then, after prompty realizing the error of this, spend the rest of the day trying to reverse the process.
$C: There is something to be said for "mind over matter". There are extraordinary things the body can accomplish. 

The guy in the video is delusional. He's the type of person who would get better, against all odds, and thank the biscuit he ate 6 years ago because someone said it was 'special'.

That's up there with people thanking God for them getting better... How about you thank the people who have devoted their lives to fixing and healing people? If you're thanking God then you need to realize he also put you in your predicament.

Didn't mean to get religious but I'm with you. This mentality is hazardous.
$C: When someone isn't selling something, I am much more inclined to believe them.  I think meditation reduces stress and when I got into it, people online were like, "No, you don't need to pay any money, just do it".

I do believe there's something about the mind affecting the body - - we've clinically proven the placebo effect is real but it's obviously not going to regrow a spine

$C: Where did he get all those wonderful toys?

$C: Existentialist Elf on the Uncomfortable Shelf? 
$C: Santa obviously keeps current
$C: After swiping your credit card on the cyber?
$C: I think you were just stealing from those people, dude.
$C: Joe Rogan does a great bit on this in his last special, it’s on Netflix.
$C: Yeah seriously. Honestly it bothers me when people think that way. It isn't mandatory to do Santa Claus, but you don't potentially ruin it for other kids by saying "yeah fuck it it's all fake!" To your kid. You could just tell your kid Santa knows some people don't want him to come so he won't stop there. If some little kid ruins Santa for my kid early I will find out who is responsible and give them a piece of my mind. The reason people do santa is because for most kids, it's the only time in their life they can believe something so fantastic. Santa keeps you in check by watching to make sure you actually deserve the gifts, but if you're a good kiddo the jolly nice man brings you a ton of toys that you get to play with through Christmas vacation. It's a really fun story and I had a blast believing in Santa when I did. My daughter is delayed and doesn't talk much but when she sees a mall Santa or even a picture of Santa she gets so happy and yells his name. Generally, kids love Santa. Let them have that.
$C: That last part is what I think the real reason is behind the Santa craze.  It's not about the magic of believing, it's about teaching kids to use their brains to figure out the difference between reality and fairy tails, and to learn how it feels when something you believed in was a lie all along, which helps later in life with relationships and such.
$C: It's something that people carry on into adulthood imo. That's why religion (to me -- you can have your own beliefs) is such a sham. It's a ruse to get people to act nice. 
$C: For certain an extreme example. But I'm personally of the belief that there is no real good reason to lie to children about mythology.
$C: You know you can still have a "childlike sense of wonderment" without Santa right? My fiancees family has never believed in Santa or done that but literally are the most Christmas loving folks I know. They love the joy that comes with giving gifts, teaching about kindness and giving, and the feeling that comes with the holidays. Santa and magic not being involved haven't removed one bit of their holiday spirit. The presents are thoughtful gifts from parent to child and child to parent which shows you truly care about the things they do for you. 
$C: This is amazing! I am stealing this idea! My brother would move the elf on a shelf every night his kids are still not sure what to believe at 12 and 13
$C: [deleted]
$C: What if she would be even more thrilled if she believed in Santa? You will never know. This is what I was getting at - Santa just enhances the holiday magic, but it's not the only component that makes the magic.
$C: it's going to be different for every kid. my siblings handled it fine, but i felt betrayed and told my dad he was a liar and hated him.
$C: I mean...my parents "lied" to me about Santa when I was a kid and I hold no ill will toward them for it.  In fact, I'm extremely grateful for it as it made my childhood Christmases more magical.
$C: Yeah fuck you. 


$C: I’m sorry you were so devastated that Santa isn’t real. 
$C: Lol I have literally never met anyone who has any kind of issues stemming from their parents lying to them about Santa. Get over yourself.

Santa was awesome. I distinctly remember the first Christmas I didn't believe in him not being nearly as fun as previous Christmases. I feel bad for kids who never get to believe that.
$C: And they usually do. Doesn’t negate the original point, it’s about having fun for the sake of fun. 
$C: Yeah, my parents never let us believe in Santa, because they figured if they lied about that, we had no right to believe them about anything else, which I think is a fairly solid principle.  When I was about 6 or 7, I was at school, and we were doing the playground thing of arguing about whether Santa was real - all very theoretical, of course - and I casually mentioned "I *know* Santa isn't real, because my Mummy told me so".

Turns out, this upset one particular kid, who went home that day accusing his poor mum of lying to him.  It turns out, she was divorced, and she and her ex took turns to have the son over for Christmas.  For her, this was going to be the last Christmas she'd ever have while her son still believed in the magic of Christmas.  So the next day she stormed up to my mum in the playground and started shouting at her about how I'd ruined Christmas, and how terrible a parent my mum was, and how her own son had accused her of lying, and my mum just turned to her and said "I mean... aren't you?"
$C: If anyone gave me shit for it I would just tell them "have they tried being honest with their kids instead of lying to them and sowing seeds of distrust at such a young age?"
$C: "Little Timmy is just mad that he didn't get what he asked for. Do you believe *everything* your friends tell you? Of course not, and of course Santa is real. Now, I heard that *this* year, Santa was hoping for a sixer of microbrews, so we're going to need to make a stop on the way home."
$C: Just pop in one of the thousand Christmas movies that give a nice elaborate cover up story.
$C: "fuck Little Timmy he doesn't know shit"
$C: Honestly though. It the phrase "They're not real" completely crushes someone's belief system. That's on them.
$C: Isn't it obvious that the raw truth can often be very rude and intentionally hurtful, in any circumstance?  People should teach their kids a little tactfulness regardless of belief in Santa/Jesus/how fat the stranger lady on the subway is.
$C: I think we lie because I can tell you right now, there was nothing before or since as magical as waking up and truly believing Santa had left those gifts, as sad as that may be in of itself.

Edit: Lol you people, not saying you can't have a nice Christmas without Santa and clearly you can be excited about presents your parents got you I sure did for the years I knew it was them. But I don't remember Shaking thinking that something actually supernatural had occurred at those times so yea it was a pretty neat "illusion" as a kid.
$C: I'm with you, and I want to never lie to my (future) kids, but it's not my place to decide that for other kids/parents either. And I don't think a 4 year old makes for a good secret keeper, so I'm not sure how to handle it. 
$C: Who hurt you?
$C: Sex is like Pizza. Even when it's bad... I still have to pay for it :(

$C: Nah, I rent stuff to stream. Renting is still/newly in.

Ethics review boards kill STEM. Apple landing on your head? We can't accept work that caused human suffering. Cats in deadly boxes? Right out. Alternating current is more dangerous than direct current - Edison's lawyers told us about those experiments. Killing and then *burning* living things? We can't allow people to eat those results. The list goes on. Every modern technology has a mad scientist standing behind it, and a team of mad engineers who built it. 

You go girl. You and i know the truth - progress requires experimentation. If a few shelf elves are emotionally traumatized, who cares. All progress depends on unreasonable people.
$C: I'm curious as to how you're supposed to get a signed consent form from something that you're still trying to figure out if it's sentient.
$C: Definitely, that's why my professor and I.. Sort-of.. Skipped the whole process. We wanted to subject our testers with manipulative content (sort of what Facebook did with their news feed but long before Facebook) without them knowing or their consent and measure their affinity to products before and after the manipulation. We began research and then, before could publish, applied for ethics review with the university. We were shitting bricks because one of the testers leaked the fucking results to one of the university panels and the news got to the psychology department and they were interested in our results and process and the shit had hit the fan at full speed. My prof went on sabbatical and told me to go into hiding, too. Until the board greenlit us, I was at home masturbating full time and my prof was in Hawaii doing his electrical engineering... Aka masturbating on the beach. 
$C: There's this cool underwater city where the scientists don't need any ethics reviews! I'll send you a link
$C: Listen here Stanley. Just because you don’t actually cause physical harm doesn’t mean you’re being ethical. It’s not cool to go around making people think that they’re responsible for electrocuting someone or that you’re going to amputate their legs. If her null hypothesis is true and that elf is real, she put him in a very real mortal fear. We’re not even going to start on the fact that she never got informed consent.
$C: Objectively not very much. Sure we might know exactly at which temperature the human body shuts down, but most "unethical experiments" from the era were apparently on the level of "if we cut both this girl's arms without anaesthesia or antibiotics, will she faint, and will the necrosis kill her? And also, let's rape her a couple times for good measure"

It's honestly disgusting, and of no significant gain whatsoever.
$C: I don’t know. How much? I am genuinely curious by this. Are there any breakthroughs that this led to that has altered/improved our current living conditions?
$C: My name is Michael Weston. 
$C: * We’ve got a notice on you, your blacklisted. 
$C: **Review 1**

*Comments:* In this paper, a novel protocol is proposed to assess the real-ness of Christmas critters, such as Shelf Elves. A series of experiments designed to restrict or stimulate movements are described and carried out in a preliminary study on a Shelf Elf. The subject matter of this work is both timely and is an area of interest to the wider community of curious toddlers. However, further experimentation from an increased sample population is required to support the controversial claim that all Shelf Elves and Santa are not real.

*Relevance:* High

*Reviewer Confidence:* 3/5

*Recommendation:* Major Revision
$C: Damnit. Now having read the abstract, I want to read the whole paper, but Elsevier has it behind a paywall. 
$C: "geolocation updates". Lol. Killin me
$C: This it's brilliant. I hope you are recognized as a contributor. Don't let principal get all the credit while you did all the writing!
$C: This is the best comment. You deserve some gold! 
$C: >No mention of *n=1* or the calculated p-value/statistical power.

Sounds like *real* science, with fear of wasting 3 months of their life on a null result and all.
$C: YOU'RE AWESOME
$C: That was awesome, thanks for the laugh :D
$C: BUT WHERE ARE THE LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY? DID IT MEET THE ADEQUATE STATISTICAL ASSUMPTIONS?
$C: Write it up and submit to the BMJ for their next Christmas/year end edition.  I guarantee it will get published.


$C: uhh w0t m8
$C: It's all about variables.
$C: So, her little brother, then?
$C: So this elf on the shelf is part of the structure, or part of the behaviour, of the natural world? No. What she has done hasn't been a scientific process, that's a massive glorification. I don't think you need to try and explain science to me either, I'm doing a masters in physics. Thanks for trying though. 
$C: >Things without wings can't fly

Counterexamples: rockets and jetpacks. Also thrust vecyoring-based VTOL aircrafts (like Harrier/F35, but not Osprey)

TL; DR: Rudolf and the reindeers uses thrust vectoring. Rudolf's nose is also probably an optical/IR targeting pod.
$C: They had to have secretly thought you were retarded. No 15 year old believes in santa.
$C: My mum told me when I was 12 that presents from Santa were stopping. Imagine how annoyed I was given that my stepdad still got a present and a 'Santa' present from his mum! 
$C: I was the same way. Easy way to get double presents
$C: I'm 32 and my mom will still write "from Santa" on some of my gifts.
$C: We get the same (dollar) amount of presents, my mom just writes our names on them rather than our names and from Santa or from Mom.

And you only got 2 presents? 
$C: I give my kids gifts from "Santa" and they're all teenagers. Although, they get presents from Elvis and michael Jackson too sooo...
$C: I chuckled 
$C: That's funny but also kinda rude. God isn't the same as Santa. One is made up based on real figure (Saint Nikolada) and other is made up based on magic

Edit: Saint Nikolada was a Greek apostle from 13 BC known for giving council gifts to the less fortunate

Edit 2: you don't need to downvote me btw. Just message me if you didn't enjoy the comment

Commentedit: No commentedit this time

Edit 3: Fun fact Saint Nikolada actually died ~~from coal poisoning~~ choked on food giving inspiration to the modern Santer Clause
$C: As a Christian, I laughed.
$C: r/atheism guys, we got this
$C: The assholes from r/Atheism are leaking.
$C: > told me Santa was a terrorist

Mum: I'm sorry GoldenJakkal, but Santa can't come this year, he's in Guantanamo Bay.

Dad: Yeah, you know all the conspiracy theories about it being a missile that hit the Pentagon? It was actually a sleigh. They've only just finished pulling bits of Reindeer out of the rubble.
$C: 15? People drive at 15. 
$C: Nah, I was just stubborn and greedy, I didn't need something to believe in. I was just worried that changing my mind would result in fewer video games on Christmas morning.
$C: maybe we need for children to not be gaslit by parents and society but IN GOD WE TRUST rite gais 
$C: I agree, theyve always seemed like the exact same thing to me.
$C: He was less involved in my life than santa, so I didn't really notice when I stoped believing, probably 12 or 13.
$C: Where I live grade 7 (age 12) is the first year of jr. High school (7,8 and 9) maybe the teacher didn't want to risk the younger kids saying something stupid and getting bullied by the older kids? Just a guess, she was a really nice lady.
$C: He was less involved in my life than santa, so I didn't really feel anything or care particularly much.
$C: It was something similar with me. I was 3 or 4 and I wanted a Lego set for Christmas. My Mom said something along the lines of it being too expensive for Santa to bring. I immediately thought "But Santa makes toys himself. Why does how much it costs in a store matter?" I kept up the charade until I was 6 because I was afraid I wouldn't get presents if I didn't believe.
$C: Much less upset than I was about santa. Santa brought me presents, god didn't actually have any involvement in my life, so my becoming an athiest was a much more passive transition with no single moment defining it.
$C: Nothing I guess. Athiest now.
$C: Thank you for saying as much. I appreciate it. It makes me feel a lot better as a mom. I have no idea what I'm doing, but I try (with all of it, lol!) and I hope he knows that one day. Thank you for being a good person to share the planet with. :)
$C: Screw it, let there be some magic in this world it is terrible.
$C: I still believed until about 6-7th grade.
You don’t need to be a jerk. I came to ending the belief in time.
$C: Hold up... The random boner thing isn't happening now? Because he totally had baby boners (which freaked me tf out) and I was told it's just a thing boys do. No??? I'm so confused.
$C: Santas for hire is a huge business in Sweden. Also asking around the office, or do neighbour cooperation "if you do my house, I do yours". The stereotype is that its the father being santa though, he "runs out for a newspaper" and then he is all "oh man, I can't believe I missed santa!" 

Typical trope in Christmas movies is that dad leaves the house, actual santa shows up, wife thinks it's her husband and praises him, kids believe he is real and meanwhile dad is somewhere else in this insane development of events. 
$C: 25
$C: Most people do at 11-13, so it's not unheard of.
$C: My girl is 10 in Feb and has only lost 5/6 teeth 
$C: Nope. 
$C: Thank you for the internet hugs. :)
$C: Hahaha, I distinctly remember asking them why they would do that. Oh but at last I got to play along for my little sister. Cold comfort as the clever bugger figured it out just a year later.
$C: But there's no sense crying over every mistake.
$C: An 'old' seven
$C: Almost 8 and a half! 
$C: Actually about 82, she got Benjamin button’d. She been enjoying the youthful charm of life. But she is just real tired of OP’s childless shenanigans with magic. 
$C: This one is my favorite!
$C: Religion has a very important "do not put the lord thy God to the test" clause, so that wouldn't really work.

Incidentally that's exactly what my parents told me about Santa when I tried to disprove his magic...
$C: Wait until she starts on sexuality...
$C: yeah then she starts dangling scissors around lab mates
$C: Why push?! My parents pushed me to be a doctor because I was smart and liked people now I am a dog walker trying to figure out how to scramble back onto a reasonable career path after I just realized I spent 4 years in school for something that I absolutely could not stand. And the sad thing is they continue to push. Point is she is 7. She is smart but that doesn't mean she has to go into STEM. Let her decide when she is older ffs. 
$C: > Try and push her towards a STEM field, she sounds like a neat little scientist.

Please don't. If she decides to go that way, then great - but the rational thinking she displayed is likely to make her successful regardless of the field she chooses.
$C: Not just STEM, all manner of research can do with some solid analytical skills and thorough investigation.
$C: I really don't like the term "push" in this case. Parents should always encourage their child's interests, not push them towards something in particular, even if they're good at it.
$C: Yes, this is the single and only indication needed that she will be great at math.
$C: Wait, outgrew the gift part? When does that happen? I'm 37 and still give and receive gifts.
$C: I knew Santa wasn't real at age 6, but I still had to be in my Christmas jammies and wait for the presents to show up at midnight. 

I always wonder, if I had a kid, would I help them believe in Santa? Would I tell them off-rip that he's just a fantasy? It feels so deceptive.
$C: This is some iamverysmart material right here. I'm sure you totally remember that from when you were three too.
$C: She hid it from you because she sensed a conspiracy.  A conspiracy that you had to be complicit in.   

She couldn't give you a chance to derail the truth.   

If a little girl can't trust her Da, what then?  What then?
$C: Yes! I totally get it. 

It is weird when they start to have parts of their lives you are completely uninvolved in. And of course that independence is part of growing up, but you go from controlling everything in a helpless infants routine, to being able to easily sway and manipulate a toddler's opinions, to parenting a child with true independence and original thought and it's weird! 

And I was a potions-maker and seem to be raising a potions maker. I'd much rather the field notes of your budding naturalist. That shampoo is expensive! 
$C: Holy crap, I used to make potions too out of soaps and shampoos and such!
$C: How did you not notice the pipe cleaners had been added to the elves?
$C: The plausible explanation is that once the magic was removed the parents came across the seemingly dead elf and continued to move it to avoid disappointing their child and ruining Christmas.
$C: He kept moving though. 
$C: Yep, straight from Steven Spielberg's own mouth. That's why ET was able to interact with the various plants throughout the movie and displays bioluminescence (the finger glow).
$C: You think that if a parent noticed that their kid touched the elf, what? The parent says Christmas is cancelled, you fucked up, you get no presents? Coming up with some way to excuse it hardly seems like a scenario that strains credulity.
$C: Your daughter will undoubtedly murder you in your sleep
$C: Everyone giving you grief about this clearly has never had kids. A doll wrapped up in pipe cleaners wouldn't even be the weirdest thing you've cleaned up that day.
$C: Of course! It's so simple. It all makes perfect sense now..........
$C: I guess I'd use the word "encourage" her to not "push her to" not to nit pick 
$C: Let me put on my... [skepticals](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gravityfalls/images/8/80/S2e2_mabel_skeptical.png/revision/latest?cb=20140804022523).
$C: Not when you crave the exquisite music that is the sound of razors cutting through flesh.  
$C: I doubt this experiment would pass any ethical review boards.

I'm still waiting for that lucky/smart/funny-early comment that will profit me thousands of karma

Maybe one day, maybe one day...
$C: I found it's like finding love. You can't make it happen you just have to let it happen. It will just take off randomly. 
$C: I think you're really overthinking it. I'm not really trying anything...just an observation. Funny enough, the comment about my highest rated post is my highest rated comment. Internet is weird.
$C: Nah, karma whoring is a full time commitment. It's all I do! Can't go giving up that easily.
$C: I do this with trips to the ice cream shops or the candy isle. They know exactly when they have done well and will use it against you whenever they can.
$C: Hey I like this a lot. I'm about to be a dad and might want to use this. 

Did it affect you negatively though? 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Ouch. How’s your self-esteem as an adult?
$C: Santa was only ever our stockings when I was a kid. He got us our little presents then our parents kept the credit for our actual presents. 
$C: Is he stealing credit or is it one of those things after you get past your "fuck you Mom and dad" phase when it clicks that they were always looking out for you.

Like Leela's parents always just a drain pipe away living in a sewer for their daughter who finally realizes she's the garbage.
$C: Santa gives small stuff for us as well.  To hard to deal with different incomes at school for my kids, on why Santa brings Tommy a Xbox X and brings Susie a Barbie doll.  One of my sons friends about 5 years ago was from a poverty stricken family, and Santa brought our kids decent things that year and it caused lots of questions.  Ever since then, Santa brings little stuff, anything nice comes from family/parents.
$C: The way it usually worked at my house is my parents got the best gift, for example a Gameboy, then Santa brought all the cool stuff that comes with it, like games.

Then by July when I stopped really  thinking about it,all the cool stuff came from my parents.
$C: Same. Husband and I talked about this the first year we had our son. Santa brings cool wooden puzzles, board games, etc., but mom and dad give the expensive things because we work really hard for them.
$C: This as well. Santa bring small toys and clothes. The bigger, more extravagant things most definitely come from me.
$C: Couldn't agree more! My oldest is getting a Nintendo 2DS this christmas, no way Santas getting the credit for that. Santa's giving him some books, A case for the DS and some candy!
$C: Getting credit? What the fuck dude? Your not supposed to take pleasure in getting credit for a gift. 
$C: You can afford a notebook?
$C: This was believable until the same shoes since 12 years old part. C'mon dude.
$C: Okay there is something else going on when you equivocate "I stopped asking for gifts" to wearing the same pair of shoes you've owned since you were in 7th grade...
$C: Dude it sounds like you may need to work on your adulting skills if at no point between 18 and 24 were you able to get yourself a new pair of sneakers. Although I imagine this story is 100% bullshit.
$C: Good point. He's only 4 so once he can comprehend my financial situation I'll make him get a job so he can help out. /s


I just make sure I don't give him whatever he wants so he doesn't grow up thinking that the world owes him everything.
$C: My daughter started telling everyone that daddy's broke because that's what I would tell her when we're out shopping. The few times she said it in public, I would chuckle awkwardly and proclaim that daddy, in fact, is not broke and that would could afford said item. 
$C: This resonates with me quite a bit. I never grew up in financial dire straits (probably upper middle class now that I reflect upon it), but I was always told that we couldn’t afford something and was never made aware of how much my parents made. My entire young adult life I’ve been forever frustrated that I wasn’t living the life my parents had until I learned what they actually made and how dirt poor I am compared to them at the same age.
$C: What kind of shoes do you have that last for 12 years? I consider myself lucky if a pair that I buy in the spring is still good in the autumn.
$C: What gigs were you all going to?
$C: I understood very little of that
$C: Just users that I know / recognize.

It wasn't meant to be a grand mystery or anything :)

$C: Son I make $28,000 a year between two jobs so you will NOT ask Santa for a fucking iPhone

$C: messing with the kid? when you put it that way I feel like you'll be playing elf on the shelf all year long just for kicks.
$C: Parent's need credit over a fake magical entity?  Yeah, it's not hard to figure that one out.  
$C: Christmas while celebrated by some secularly is definitely a Christian holiday. It literally is about Jesus’s birth. It has Christ in the name.
$C: I have seen some of /u/HouseSomalian 's notable shitposts before. They've got a gift for it.
$C: I remember once listening phone call recording of schizophrenic rambling to customer service. It sounded very similar to what he wrote.
$C: I was never taken to karmacourt, though... I think someone owes me karma for that!
$C: Thank you! 
$C: I did a ctrl+f for lego, but clearly it wasn't good enough lol.
$C: Santa is Luke Skywalker's father.
$C: This is the second film of a trilogy they could have waited to kill him off. There was so much importance put on him only to just fucking kill him off without telling us more. No where near how Palpatine was handled. Snoke was given more lines and screen time than the emperor when he was first introduced and was given more of an impact directly to a major character seen off screen but no fucking window into where the fuck he came into the picture and started fucking things up with Ben and the rest of the Galaxy. The movie was a cop out to tell an edgy way of story telling and a big F you to people who invested time and money into the story told so far fans and creators alike.
$C: It's actually moving downwards at a speed of 9.8 m/s
$C: r/shittymorph
$C: You sonnofabitch I deserved that so hard 
$C: I'm not suggesting withholding the truth either (you don't tell the entirety of your life story when people ask how your day's going, do you?).  Outright lying, especially fabricating an elaborate story about Santa, has nothing to do with "preserving a kid's innocence" or their well being.  
$C: > Lying can actually be beneficial to a society... 

I understood this. The Santa thing isn't like telling the child of a single parent that their runaway dad really does love them (when they don't). They were lying to me so they could all laugh about it and feel good. It wasn't for the good of anything. The fact that it was a pointless lie is what made it terrible imo.

$C: No GIF backs. 
$C: Finally, someone who gets it. 
$C: This maybe an unpopular opinion but do you really want the only reason your kids behave to be because of a magic man on Christmas morning? 
$C: No I'm not a parent but my parents(like the vast majority of THE PARENTS AROUND THE WORLD) didn't raise me or any of my siblings with stories of Santa being real and we've all generally turned out just fine
$C: Of course he is! I can still smell the bourbon on his breath as I sat on his lap in that run down Minnesota mall. 
$C: I'm confused, are you comparing drinking to telling your kids Santa isn't real in the first place or telling them he isn't real after initially telling them he was? 
$C: Jealously. I've seen better...
$C: We told you this was Melodrama 
$C: Dishonestly, I thought it was lame.
$C: AND leaving all the damn lights on.... touching  the thermostat! 
$C: But there's no way in hell he'll let them fall off a bike, crash into the back of a car while learning to ride a bike, get hit by an out of control sledder, get run over by a car driving into a building, or hit the floor after falling off his shoulders, the sofa, the bed, the conveyor thing at the grocery store, or a balcony.

$C: There's no reason not to give OP some credit for the well-crafted homage to the performances in this film.  It's possible to give Nicholson all the Kudos he deserves for his brilliant interpretation and portrayal of Colonel Jess, and appreciate OP for some cleverness as well.  It's not an either/or situation.

$C: Does this apply with other supernatural things, or only the one you care about?
$C: You can just tell your kids that those other kids that don't believe in Santa are just evil and will go to hell. And should either be shunned or condescendingly told that Santa loves them anyway and that you will ask for presents for them so they can get toys too on Christmas morning. 
$C: Why in fucks name is this getting downvoted?
$C: [deleted]
$C: It's similar to letting children believe that they'll grow to be great professional athletes, etc. It's highly unrealistic, but there's no harm in letting them believe and pretend. 
$C: And I never suggested otherwise. It's just that my 5 year old likes to believe in the magic of Christmas and I don't find it necessary to teach her the truth just because it's "no big deal." She'll learn in due time but she'll enjoy believing every year until then. 
$C: Didn't see any comments like that and certainly never meant that in mine. Without Santa Christmas doesn't become shitty, he just makes it more magical. Of course we will never know the truth unless we conduct a research with two identical groups of children.
$C: I came to the conclusion that as long as I get gifts from Santa I still believe in him. At 36years old I still get gifts from him every year! It is weird that he has yet to figure out that I moved from my parents house though.
$C: Jesus, what's it like to see your mother convicted of murder at such a young age? 
$C: "Little Timmy's mom is a goddam crack whore, spread the word to you friends!"
$C: Yea, but maybe less so if they are 4. 
$C: Well, I understand that my initial comment was not tactful; of course I'm not going to go around telling other parents to eat my shorts-- unless they're being an ass about it in the first place (which has never happened). 

We have told our children that Santa is just a fun story, but that this is a secret a lot of other kids don't know. They understand not to make fun of others for believing in it, and to be nice (as always). In practice this has mostly resulted in them thinking it's fun to be in on the secret on the parents' side, and egging the other kids along.
$C: In my family the deal was that Santa filled your stocking with candy and knick-knacks, but the actual gifts under the tree were from your parents. And I can tell you that there was nothing before or since as magical as waking up and seeing the gifts that my parents bought for me.
$C: That's even worse. You were led to believe in a false reality that makes you view the real thing as less magical. Life is crazy beautiful and magical as it is and it appears this huge cultural lie blinded you from that. 
$C: I guess the rest of the non American world never had a "magical" or enjoyable childhood then because their parents didn't delude them? 
$C: Christmas as a kid are probably my best memories and even as a teen they are amazing memories. I remember getting a Wii and rock band as me and my siblings split gift and the whole family (Nanny, poppa, aunts, uncle's, mom, dad) playing it together and having so much fun. 


This was around 2008 or 2009 so I was around 12 at the time.

Shilling below beware...


The Wii and game boy are a part of the best memories I have with friends and family and I feel like they just helped me connect with people I already liked and loved. From Pokemon to bowling I have amazing memories.

$C: There are wondrous, amazing, magical things that happen every day in our reality. The properties of light in the space time continuum are baffling even though we can describe light very accurately. And magnets?! Are you kidding?? Wtf is up with that shit! You were robbed man. My sense of wonder in the world is still intact. 
$C: I'm with you, we never lied to our kids, now 9 and 11.  But we always made sure to tell them from a young age, other families pretend santa is real, if they ask you or discuss santa pretend it's real.  My daughter is autistic and can't wrap her head around why you would want to pretend that, but so far they haven't ruined it for anyone.  
  
Myself at 24 i believe accidentally ruined it for a family friends kid, who I didn't know was around the corner.  Yeah that wasn't fun.
$C: You can't always tell the 100% truth to your children for very obvious reasons but stuff like Santa and the Easter bunny just aren't worth lying about 
$C: [deleted]
$C: I would say we all are. When I found out 100% Santa wasn't real, and probed adults on it, I recognized a culture of liars and deceivers. People laugh and joke about it, then grow up and cheat on their husbands and wives, embezzle from their companies, generally stab each other in the backs.
$C: But your tip will tell the difference 
$C: Buttsex is a lot like spinach, if you're forced to have it as a kid you won't like it as an adult...
$C: Better with pineapple?
$C: Just sprayed milk out my nose reading that
$C: Now I want pizza. 

But I want sex afterwards.
$C: Sex is also like pizza because some people like it yeasty and some like the bottom to be a little burned. And you can only really serve one at a time unless people are serving themselves. Oh, and it sometimes comes in a little box. And it's better with Coke.

I think I'm all out.
$C: I was thought you were going to say, "Sex is like Pizza. I bring extra sausage but she says she's vegan. Then an hour later I catch her swallowing my roommate's eggplant parmesan."

Or is that just me? :(
$C: Yea but paying for it is like not paying for it, you're getting fucked in the end.
$C: Even when it's bad... It's still pretty good 
$C: Dump him. Puns are the highest form of comedy. Anyone who says otherwise is a drain on society. Better yet, murder him. The world is better off without him. Just ask Samuel Johnson.

RIP mobile data cap.
$C: Depending on what you do. For most screen recordings, gif files usually still provide a smaller file because neither do you need a high frame rate nor does a lot change between frames.
$C: Yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
$C: I'm crying 
$C: I want more of this
$C: Holy shit I wasn't ready for this.
$C: Aww you killed it.
$C: I definitely think Ill watch it. When I mentioned it to my dad, he told me he has watched it 3 times so far.
$C: I mean, it's one of my top 5 favorite movies. 
$C: It's in my top5 movies of all time. I really really really like it.
$C: I love that movie, it's peak Nicholson and Cruise was young and very passionate in it. But as I grew older I realize how it becomes less plausible for a witness to just be 'pressured' into confessing a crime instead of claim some amendement. 
$C: Based on your comment alone, I just watched this entire movie. Goddamn, I knew the ending but it was still pretty epic 
$C: When I first watched it, I was on the side of Tom Cruise.  Today, I'm more on the side of Jack Nicholson.
$C: One of those movies (like Shawshank Redemption) that is on TV all the time and I have to watch it every single time lol

Great flick!
$C: > not movies put down the pitchforks everyone just standalone scenes

Oh I disagree, this is in fact my favorite movie of all time and has been for a long time, up there with The Prestige, For Love of the Game, Ghostbusters and Garden Space.  It's all round a brilliant movie, in fact I can't think of a better movie that stars Demi Moore.
$C: Ooooo...are we doing top 5 movie scenes now?  Gotta throw in the "Coffee is for closers!" scene from Glengarry Glen Ross.   

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elrnAl6ygeM
$C: will do man
$C: It's a scary world, they might not be old enough to have seen the film.
$C: nah man, I had no idea that was a line in the movie! lol. Im actually 19, the movie is 6 years older than me lmao.
$C: "Where's my bat? I think more clearly with my bat..."
$C: "I strenuously object" got thrown around a lot in undergrad mock trial and again in law school. So many good lines from this. Not a surprise, thanks to Sorkin. 
$C: My go to quote is always "THANK YOU FOR PLAYING SHOULD WE OR SHOULD WE NOT FOLLOW THE ADVICE OF THE GALACTICALLY STUPID!"
$C: “One more and I get a set of steak knives,” is my absolute favorite thing to say for any reason. 
$C: for sure, im pretty sure hed love to again lol
$C: for sure man.
$C: Lmao, that's actually hilarious. 
Honestly, even if I didn't know that was a movie quote, I would find that hilarious, being the kid. Idk. 

I would find it even funnier if I was watching you talk the the kid though. 

It's definitely funnier because I watched this gif though. 
$C: His wife is a whore
$C: I know, It's all good. My reply was a line from the movie when Jack Nicholson talks back to the judge,
$C: Going to watch it when I get home. 
$C: And they will therefore have one of the strangest movie experiences of all time. I envy them
$C: Yes
$C: Without hesitation.
$C: Definitely. 
$C: I'm excited for you that you get to see this for the first time.
$C: Ya like dags?

Dags?

OH, DOGS.  Yea, I like dOgs.
$C: So this is where hair of the dog came from? Got it.
$C: Or cookie dough
$C: This made me laugh, picturing a female Cailou. 
$C: If she has long hair, Deputy Biscus is probably concerned and maybe even embarrassed by her terrible comb-over.  
$C: ALOPECIA IS REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAL!
$C: Aha!
$C: Oh.  This is fine.
$C: I thought you meant Deputy Biscuits which I started laughing and laughing about and I’m so glad you didn’t because now that’s my new *original* nickname for our pup.  I always call her our “little investigator” because she is always burying her head in every new package we bring home and sniffing and investigating every noise.

We call her dog cookies “dog biscuits” sometimes.

From this day forward she shall be known as “DEPUTY BISCUITS”!
$C: 😻What a fantastic dog!
$C: Fellow father of a very inquisitive 7 year old girl here. How did yours handle the Santa's not real talk? My daughter has been asking some very interesting questions about Santa and I think she's been reaching the same conclusion your daughter did. 
$C: How old is Hibiscus?
$C: When you said she acts as your deputy in your previous comment, I had a hunch she was a terrier! We have a 3 year old West Highland Terrier, and she is such a goody two shoes, always trying to make sure everyone stays in line. Our groomer tells us that she frequently "scolds" other dogs who are getting groomed when they misbehave/act out with the groomers. We also have a puppy who is extremely mischievous (read: husky), and the Westie always barks when she goes in a room she isn't supposed to, or takes towels off the shelf, etc. Terriers are too funny! 
$C: Oh my god I love that you even have the little deputy hat
$C: How cute! I thought it would be short for biscuits, like some form of a shortened way a child would say it. The flower makes a lot more sense =)
$C: Everyone just wanted a picture of Biscus. Thank you! 
$C: God loves a terrier!
$C: Oh, definitely needed to adjudicate a meeting.  
$C: /r/dogswearinghats would love that picture :)
$C: She looks like such a jerk!  In an awesome way.  I need to post some more pictures of my super passive Dachshund. My wife and I are in the market for another dog but we haven't been able to get to the shelter for their events.....I want a bigger buddy (grew up on French Brittney's) and she thinks they'll just be ridiculous.  This is our only point of contention in our first 6 months of marriage.
$C: Wonderful pic!
$C: I LOVE HER!!
$C: A little bit country, and a little bit rock and roll. 
$C: Deputy Biscus is a total darling. 
$C: /u/Scudstock knighted the dog and you go and complain about it? Yeeesh.
$C: I let you into my laboratory.. I let you use my microscope.. and you try to sell my notes to Big Pharma?! I AM BIG PHARMA
$C: OMG this comment provided me much needed laughter, thank you witty stranger!!  
$C: i make 'em a thesis dey don' refuse. i take care everyting.
$C: He made them a theory they couldn't refute. 
$C: Holy shit
$C: Tell him it was academic, not personal.
$C: read this with the perfect Don Corleone voice
$C: A movie with a physicist mafia boss. That would be awesome.
$C: "But, you see Doc, both my arms are broken.." 
$C: "But doctor, I *am* Pagliacci"
$C: Rurn Wursley and Survurmurs Snurp.
$C: *aaaaaaaaaaaaaa.*
$C: Ah yes, you're right - I forgot a control goup and double blind tests are mandatory. Just like incompetent mad scientitsts and many advocators of alternative healthcare...
$C: which is basically unethical fraud if you start with that as your intention where you collect research data then spin it after the fact as reviewing records. 

But it's the kind of fraud where it's hard to prove you did it with such intent. 

AKA: the only way to actually get anything done is to behave unethically in a way that you're unlikely to get caught.

it's what people actually do to get past IRB's but it fails the basic test of "if it's honest, ethical and ok are you willing to let people know that's what you're going to do before you do it"
$C: That is indeed a challenge but that's your problem to try to solve.  Not the IRBs. 
$C: >my prof was in Hawaii doing his electrical engineering... Aka masturbating on the beach

Wait... so are you saying that your prof has a cyborg dick?
$C: Where's that link?
$C: Well okay obviously I'm not going to argue that the Milgrim experiment was super classy (although admittedly informative), but in this case I disagree that the elf would have been in serious mortal peril. It could've run away at any time. Unless this was a rock and a hard place scenario where the Elf was afraid to abandon the act because he feared that the result upon his return to the North Pole would have been a dishonorable death, and because of this fear he was ultimately willing to take the amputation for the team and his livelihood. Maybe he would've been at peace with surrendering his life right there because it would have been better than having to return to his master with a report of failure. But in that case my beef is with Claus, not this girl. She couldn't have known the Jolly Bearded Man's work ethics are akin to a movie mob boss'. 
$C: This guy fucks. 
$C: Milgram gets replicated every ~10 years, last time early this year: https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/05/new-milgram-replication-finds-90-per-cent-of-polish-participants-willing-to-deliver-highest-shock/

To be fair they cut it in half due to ethical concerns though.
$C: The scientists were also very dedicated nazis. You can't torture and kill hundreds of people without being convinced they're not really people. So all the results were horribly biased to their detriment, because the experiments all had to conclude that the Jews were inferior. 
$C: "If I brutally torture one twin, will the other twin still be traumatised?" 
$C: It's not particularly useful, just a lot of examples of torture, apparently. The thing that came to mind was hypothermia research, but I'm not a doctor. ~~It has been used, but the ethics of using it and quality of results is, apparently, debatable.~~ Not for the faint of heart:

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2u3axx/did_human_experimentation_conducted_by_the_nazis/

$C:  I used to be a spy, until...
$C: **Review 2**

*Comments:* Experiment did not include a base test group to determine normal reactions under each movement case. For example, a household dog may display identical reactions under similar tests. It is possible that certain Christmas creatures have different key words or bribing techniques, and this could vary house-to-house. It is also likely that the order of tests, namely touching as the first test, interfered with the creature's normal movement abilities.

*Relevance*: High

*Reviewer Confidence:* 2/5

*Recommendation:* Major Revision

$C: Kudos on spotting the error in the study! Still, it's promising work for such a young investigator.
$C: ja
$C: [deleted]
$C: It's sitting on the shelf, so obviously part of the natural world.

Also, study of ghosts or supernatural events can definitely be science even if it turns out to not be real.
$C: Do you also think that biology isn't science? Because "is this thing actually alive" is a rather important part of it.
$C: More like a masters in unqualified pretentiousness!
$C: Id youre doing a masters in physics, you should have better reading comprehension and not ignore "...structure and behavior of the *physical and* natural world..."

That and you should be old enough to understand this a conversation about a 7 year old at Christmas.

TL;DR Fuck off & grow up
$C: Yeah my favorite animal is a jetpack.
$C: As a parent, I would be OK if they pretended until they were 15. Obviously we know you know, but it keeps the fun and magic alive for us too.
$C: I have two younger brothers and we basically didn't talk about the fact Santa didn't exist so as not to ruin it. One Christmas my youngest brother came to us and said "you know I don't believe in santa" and we we're all relieved that we didn't have to keep the charade 
$C: Oh yeah they did (they still do). I've been through reeeally embarassing conversations with friends in front of my parents just to hide the fact that I know. The things you do for christmas presents.
$C: My dads friends daughter believed until about that age. He read her letter to santa and it asked for boobs. 
$C: I'm almost 30 and some of my gifts still say from Santa 
$C: Haha I feel like 2 presents is a lot (at least just from parents)
$C: A Saint was an apostle from 13 BC. You sure about that?
$C: I found the guy who's self conscious about his doubts.
$C: Word. No santa. No big g.
$C: I guess I just can't fathom believing in santa when you are 12 - 13. It just doesn't seem possible to me.
$C: The baby boners are totally different from the beginning of puberty boners because those come with real sexual thoughts, hair, and intense curiosity of the opposite sex.
$C: That's a really interesting tradition. Is that all of Scandinavia or just Sweden?
$C: Honey that wasn’t me you just made love to father Christmas
$C: "No one asked whether the baby tooth came from my mouth..."
$C: I was 16 and had 6 teeth removed, put them under the pillow and I got 6 computing textbooks. Honestly all I wanted was a few bucks.
$C: [deleted]
$C: We just keep on trying 'til we run out of cake
$C: She's seven, going on thirty
$C: "If you touch the lord, he loses his magic"
$C: She does like scissors afterall.
$C: My advisor "jokes" about murdering his whole team. She'll fit right in.
$C: > doesn't mean she has to go into STEM

oh lordy be careful saying that on reddit.
$C: Nah man. They should put her in STEM classes. There are schools all over that specialize in STEM. She obviously likes to use her analytical skills, so why not? It's not like she won't be exposed to other skills as well. 
$C: Hahahahahaha look at this guy everyone!
$C: I didn't grow up with santa (Jewish) and my husband did so he wanted to do it, but the whole idea of lying to my kid freaked me out for a while. What convinced me was my husband saying this is how we can teach our kid that adults lie and trick you sometimes. (I've also heard something about "this is how you teach your kid about the joy of giving someone a gift when they don't know it's from you" or some shit, but the teaching her about lying one seemed more important to me).  

Also we play practical jokes on her a lot and she already knows we tricked her into giving up her bottle by saying it got lost in a snowstorm last year even though she believed in the snowstorm story for a year and would tell everybody how she lost her bottle in the snow, so I hope she won't be too traumatized.  She is super excited about it though, she met some dude dressed as an elf at a store who gave her a free toy (he worked at the store) and she was telling me all about how she met a *real* elf.  
$C: This is the sort of story your parents don't forget, and eagerly share.
$C: Uh, you understand that lots of people have memories of their early childhood, don't you? It's not like that's a wild claim or anything.
$C: Anyone else hearing the conspiracy music from JFK right now?

I'm imagining Kevin Costner reading out her notebook...
$C: She's through the looking glass. 
$C: Everyone is suggesting I buy my daughter a chemistry set for Christmas and I think you should do the same for your daughter. Even better, a make-your-own perfume kit. My mom got me one as a kid to curb my bathroom sink potions and I looooved playing around with it trying to create my own scent. Maybe your daughter would like that, too?
$C: /r/shittyaskscience
$C: Mom:  "Well we had to move him, he was DEAD.  Do you think we want our daughter to know she RUINED CHRISTMAS?!" *runs away and crying*

Daughter:  "I ....uh...."

see the parents weren't committed enough to the magic of christmas
$C: Wow, taking that to the extreme, huh? 
$C: I think you ditch the elf and tell the kid it lost magic so they feel guilty as fuck. Then you say the only way for him to get his magic back is to do chores. 
$C: Fair! :)
$C: 7 year olds don't know much about ethics, what's impressive is that she's conducting experiments at all
$C: why did it get deleted after an hour?
$C: To give a bit more context, we were a little strapped for cash because the holidays and my birthday were approaching so $100 dropped on a sewing machine randomly was something I was trying to justify in my head. And this was the sentence that came to mind lol
$C: I'm terrible explaining this type of things but I'll give it a shot...

*You have no right to question my actions if you benefit from them.*
$C: You’d be setting your kid up for a lifetime of self-esteem issues by phrasing it that way. 

I’d recommend asking them if they’ve earned it rather than if they deserve it, because the former is about what they did while the latter is about who they are. And give them clear expectations about what they can do to earn it—good grades, a list of optional chores, etc. And make sure they understand that you love them anyways.
$C: I’m pretty stable? Lol as I described in another post, it helped frame things in a light of prioritizing justification as well as creating self esteem since he obviously rewarded me every single time I said yes and had a reason. And when I was rejected it was usually reasonable or because we didn’t have money and that would be communicated.
  
Such as getting a bike after getting nothing but As or whatever.  
$C: Huh, if only parents were the appropriate people to correct their spawns when they’re wrong...
$C: It’s good? It came from a place of Love, because we were lower/working class they couldn’t provide every little whim but it def set the standard that if one can justify something, then it is deserved :) 
  
That being said, I may or may not have killed several people that may or may not have deserved it..
$C: Then why was Santa special?  I don't get family's that do that.  Santa is magic, bringing what you "can't."  When kids get older and realize that it was you the whole time, they appreciate it even more.  Santa should be bigger than the parent's pride. 
$C: I'm writing it on my arm
$C: The little 2x3 ones are really easy to steal.
$C: Thank god someone said it. There is no way in fucking hell that not only did he wear the same pair of shoes for TWELVE YEARS (I could maybe see two years MAX assuming they’re tennis shoes) but his parents also did not notice their child went through the majority of middle school and all of HS and college in the same shoes. I just don’t understand why anyone would make some shit up like this, what agenda are they trying to push?
$C: I didn’t grow up poor but I have the same winter boots I’ve had since I was 12 since I‘m the same shoe size and there’s no reason to replace them. It’s not that unbelievable.
$C: It's not unbelievable to me. Some female people don't grow much bigger after puberty. Especially female non-white people. I know at least 5 women wearing the same size shoes from middle school. They're all immigrants to America. They aren't wearing the same damn shoes though. That's on the father-works-3-jobs and can't notice you level. I've seen that too. 
$C: I actually have a pair of shoes I've had since 6th grade (almost 14 years ago).  They're not my main shoes; they are well-worn; but they are still in my closet.   



I too stopped growing at age 12
$C: Do they even walk?
$C: Honestly, I'm with /u/incandescent_candels. My parents always complained about lack of money when I was young, especially when I asked for something, and I stopped asking for stuff. Then, slowly, I stopped asking for what I needed, Bc I could "make it work." It was all about taking the burden off my parents. Next thing you know, I'm an adult out in my own, and it's next to impossible for me to buy anything. My girlfriend gets so upset with me because I have holes in my shoes but I've been trained for 15 years that buying=bad and new items is morally wrong. It really messes with you.

Ironically, my brothers never came to this conclusion and are still nickel and dining my dad for all he's worth, and he keeps giving them money he doesn't have.
$C: Nope. OP's parents were so broke that he thinks he's broke even when he makes money. 

Admittedly, I also have a pair of boots and shoes that I've owned for years. So, that's a tough comparison to make. 
$C: Helping pay for my fathers medical bills and being listed as temporarily disabled kind of puts a huge dent in your finances, since the shoes still fit I still wear them, thanks for the vote of confidence though 👍🏻
$C: I can’t even tell what brand they are anymore because they’re so old everywhere the brand use to be has worn away. I cleaned them a lot when I was younger because I knew I’d have to make them last, the parts around the arch are made of a really hard plastic type material that’s really lasted well, the bottoms of the shoes are of course worn down a ton but have managed to not create any holes, I just have to be mindful when it’s raining to not slip. I also never wore them in the late spring and summer, I’d buy cheapo dollar store flip flops and wear those out until I couldn’t fix them anymore with super glue or they just tore apart. 
$C: Basically. Pulling the trick that he mentioned doesn't work well from a child's point of view. They will forever feel like they're making you spend to much and be stingy with money for a good position of their life.
$C: ~~I'm guessing 2 years of visitation for Christmas?~~

Edit: Apparently 2 numbers ending the username? That's dumb.

$C: Ah goddamn it, autocorrect fucked me over
$C: Ah, the ol reddit santaroo...


I'm too lazy to link it. Just imagine it.
$C: ... Is this looked down upon?

Asking for an elf. 
$C: Judging me as a parent off one comment is pretty ignorant. How old are you? 
$C: Ok, so its got a Christian name. Big deal, I know a couple dudes named Jesus or Chris, doesn't mean they're religious figures. Is any of the actual content of the holiday even vaguely Christian? If anything its pagan, but even that is so abstracted you can't really identify any of it without consulting a historian. Trees with decorations on them? Santa Claus? Elves? Chocolate and candy canes?Giving colorfully wrapped presents under the aforementioned tree? Stockings? Coal? Gingerbread? Giant meals? Flying talking pregnant reindeer with glowing noses who mysteriously have traditionally male names? Not seeing the Christianity in any of this
$C: >I'm not suggesting withholding the truth either (you don't tell the entirety of your life story when people ask how your day's going, do you?).  

Why would I? They only asked about my current day, do you understand how words work?

>Santa, has nothing to do with "preserving a kid's innocence" or their well being.  


It creates a sense of wonder and magic in a world otherwise filled boring monotony and mundane events. How many people do you know have serious trust issues, commitment problems, or other psychological effects SOLELY from believing in Santa as a child? None? Because people have been functioning fine after believing in for generations.
$C: If you view it as pointless lie, sure. But not everyone is so jaded. 
$C: To celebrate the winter solstice, and the longer days that follow?  As much as Christianity has appropriated, I can't really see its own appropriation as undeserved.
$C: Ho Ho HOL UP
$C: Daymn dat girl is jolly.

...

We could make it work. 
$C: Did you just assume their emotional disposition? Check your privilege.
$C: Using this from now on lmao
$C: Was that a micro-aggression BRAH?!!
$C: Can I be a mod?
$C: If you get a good rhythm going the **#O**s turn into tons of lil mini **o**s
$C: Lana!
$C: Goose. 
$C: Tip top of the tiers
$C: With no due respect, you really can't see how the lines make sense, or do you just want to nitpick to sound smart? Idiosyncracies of inidividual children aside, it applies well enough for a silly gif. I understand why you won't put it in your list of Academy Award predictions though.
$C: Pretty smart huh? I would go as far as saying GIFted
$C: I gif you a gold but I eated it
$C: I use the threat of eternal hellfire and suffering with my kids. That way it lasts all their lives!
$C: Well this is my first kid so I'm learning as I go. I'm not big on whipping or anything like that because I was beat when I was a kid, and that obviously didn't help at all. But I do understand where you're coming from.
$C: This makes me think of when I talk to people about someone being a good person, or at least wanting to be a good person, and the reasoning behind it. I think that if you're only trying to be a good person because of some fear of repercussion from a religious standpoint, karma, etc. that it's not genuine and doesn't really even make you a good person. Be a good person, or at least strive and want to be because you simply want to be that way, not because you fear the consequences if you're not.
$C: Kids at that age have developed empathy or sympathy yet, so bribery is a good substitute at the time.
$C: aren't we all doing that with politicians?
$C: So have we, the children who grew up who believing as long as we could.
$C: Eh, some dads will do that, yes. Others will relieve themselves of any parenting duties and watch tv instead. 
$C: Right? Give me some nice roasted brussel sprouts and the kids ain't getting any even if they wanted them!
$C: What kind of sicko doesn't like chopped liver?
$C: To be propogated!
$C: What does it feel like typing all this out and going back and forth over the internet about a masterpiece of a gif about Santa Claus with the context of a few good men? 
$C: I agree, I just wanted to point out that it seemed like some people were forgetting that the main reason they could "hear" the gif so well was that it was a perfectly chosen scene. Throw some love Jack's way, he's the one who sold the performance so well that everyone can hear that rant so clearly in our heads when we see it. 
$C: "I can't see them, so they can't see me."

Works every time..
$C: The cold pressor test is a fantastic example of the subjectivity of "mind over matter".

 There is a physiological aspect to sensitivities. Pain is one that can be fought and overcome. 

This is also why initial screening of patients is so important. You may have a person who stubbed their toe believing this is the end, their life is over, that damn stool did me in; another person may have just had their whole arm lopped off saying "it's just a flesh wound... C'mon you pansy"
$C: I just saw your username. I suppose there is a bit of relevance in my statement furthering your point.

Merry RamaHannuKwanzaamas, mate. Or whatever makes you and yours happy. We're all on this rock together. Cheers
$C: So a sub for "it gets better the more times you watch"?
$C: No but I have a pet giraffe. Sometimes he gently gyrates in the general direction of germs. He bought me a gym membership too, so generous.
$C: Do you go to a zoo to see the graphs? You know, the long neck things with purple tongues.
$C: yeah, his name is George.
$C: No but I've seen those Jiraffes at the zoo...
$C: Does gif start with a gu?
$C: ***"Wilhite's name comes up frequently in debate over the pronunciation of the GIF acronym. “The Oxford English Dictionary accepts both pronunciations,” Mr. Wilhite said. “They are wrong. It is a soft 'G,' pronounced 'jif.'"***

He developed/invited it. Seems he has the right to declare the pronunciation.
$C: This happens literally all the time. Even in his video he only claims that doctors said he "probably" wouldn't walk again. That leaves the possibility of it healing if he's lucky. What do you want to investigate?
$C: Yeah! The brain damaged kind :D
$C: +1 Belief in Santa, -10 hit points, -10 Trust in parents, +3 to bully.
$C: Santa would *really* come out ahead on shipping costs with a Prime account.
$C: Because nobody has the right to dictate to other parents what they can and can not tell their child to believe in. If you don't want to tell your child about Santa you don't have to, imagine people that come from a culture that doesn't even celebrate Christmas, is this guy going to 'give them a piece of his mind' if their child says it isn't real?

I'm all for parents telling their children to keep the secret to themselves to not ruin it for others, but if you choose to lie to your child about something you can't fault someone else when they learn the truth. That's simply the chance you take, anyone could tell them the truth anytime, or they will just figure it out for themselves as most children do.
$C:  Replace Santa Claus with god or mohammed in their statement and read it again
$C: [deleted]
$C: I don't know of any evidence but if you think about it in terms of common sense, it would be a good lesson in thinking critically and not believing things people tell you just because of who said it. Like personally I don't hate my parents for telling me Santa was real, but I know that my mum calls random health articles from Women's Weekly "journal articles" and has heard that journal articles are more likely to be credible with ideas supported by evidence, and so she spouts a heck of a lot of bullshit while fully believing in it. So I know that I should not blindly trust someone is telling an accurate fact just because I'm fond of them. Get what I'm getting at?
$C: I read 26 and was like, lucky you, I haven't received a Christmas gift since 17, but dang! 36?! Maybe someone can gift me a new phone that isn't shattered to pieces so I don't misread comments...

I miss Christmas magic. I haven't felt that... feeling... in a long time. Does the feeling come back when you have kids of your own? Not sure I ever will, but if so, might nudge me in the direction of fatherhood. 
$C: Why is a 4 y/o believing one random kid over everyone else they know? A parent should be able to nip that pretty easily. There's gobs of movies & books to keep the lie up. I tell my kids the truth, and they still question if he exists due to how much in our culture says he does.

$C: Hmm, that seems a nice compromise.
$C: correct 
$C: It's a pretty amazing tradition if you think about it. It's so awesome and magical that everyone comes together to build this cool story for their kids. It's pretty sad you're thinking about one of the most positive and pure American traditions as delusion. 
$C: Yeah for sure! But that doesn't have anything to do with Santa...
$C: You don't have to do either... 

If you don't feel good about lying to your kids just tell them that you're not gonna tell them if he's real or not.

Let them believe if they want to there's no reason to "ruin" it for them.
$C: It is lying, it's how I see it.  Not OP, but i'm with OP.  Cant' get over it.
$C: I guess majority of the the world should feel bummed out coz their parents didn't delude them? 
$C: ...and that's how all lies and deceit started - with good old St Nick
$C: TIL that I'm supposed to be tipping my pizza delivery guy, and my prostitute
$C: Just the tip?
$C: Oh my
$C: Just like a night out with Tom Cruise... Reddit comment threads always end with buttsex. 
$C: Holy mackerel man that one made me snort laugh 
$C: Does that mean if you like it as a kid you're gonna force it as an adult?
$C: Better have the dough ready
$C: Let me know when you finish the pizza
$C: Anything can be porn of you play with yourself while you watch it! 
$C: It was for me!

$C: Nobody tell my little buddy, he can't handle the truth. 
$C: Uhh... me too thanks? 
$C: >Frame rate: 24,000 fps

That's a lot of frames.
$C: what sort of a loser uses a deblock of 1:0:0 with a cabac of 0 amirite
$C: Hes right that he saw a webm though. Webm is the container used for native html5 playback and is the one gfycat and imgur use (youtube uses its own vp9 because they are retarded). 
$C: You can make low frame rate video files. Also GIFs have zero inter-frame compression (one of the reason they are so bad). It's literally just a bunch of bitmaps (with a limited color palette) with generic lossless compression (which is very bad for images). An actual video format can take much more advantage of a video that doesn't change much between frames.
$C: This scene doesn't carry the same weight if you don't know the full context - watch the movie then in a week watch just this scene again, feels a lot more intense.
$C: It's a great movie. Instant classic
$C: Do it! It's a great movie, and that seen is incredible, but you need the build up that makes it such a great payoff.
$C: > I definitely think Ill watch it

That is exactly what Jack is talking about. You are not quite ready.  


$C: Jack Nicholson had 19 minutes of screen time and won the Oscar for best supporting actor. It's a very good movie.
$C: I've seen it probably 20 times or so.  It's fantastic all around.
$C: It's a slow movie, but damn does it finish strong. No doubt one of the top five movie scenes in cinema history. It's worth watching the movie just to have full context when watching that scene. 
$C: It is always epic no matter how many times you've seen it
$C: Really? Perjury is your thing?
$C: Did you mean Garden State? Not to be a typo Nazi, I liked your other choices and have never heard of Garden Space. I couldn't find it on IMDB but would want to watch it if Garden Space is what you meant.

Otherwise, Garden State is one of my favorites, too. A lot of people knock it because of manic pixie girl tropes, but I think it's awesome anyway.
$C: It's one of my favorites too but I've gotten in quite a few arguments over the definition of "best"
$C: dude, im actually a 19 year old college sophomore. This movie is 6 years older than me.
$C: Wait how old do you need to be to have seen A Few Good Men?
$C: He's not really off the mark there. I like to walk around the house messing with stuff when I'm thinking. Usually a tennis racket or a golf club.
$C: I put it away. 
$C: What do you wanna talk about now? My favorite color?


God, jack is so good in this
$C: I haven't seen the movie in over a decade lines escape me
$C: I like caravans more...
$C: Fucking Cailou.
$C: That's me!
$C: Deputy Biscuits is a fine, original name! Now all you need is a cat to call Captain Pickles!

Hibiscus is actually a dog of many nick names because she has such a big personality that I can never settle on just one. At Christmas time, her nick name is usually Biscochito, for example. 

Whenever we have a package delivery, Deputy Biscus immediately clocks in as T.S.Agent Biscus. She thrusts her nose into the box to inspect for anything dangerous, like large pocket air-bombs that she ALWAYS violently rips out of the box, punctures said pocket air-bomb with her teeth causing a loud POP! which then causes her to lose her fucking mind. Once she has detonated all of the pocket air-bombs, she then returns to inspecting each item in the box, sometimes stealing an item if we’re not paying attention.

Last year, I ordered my kids and their best friend 3 stuffed tarantulas for Christmas (they love unusual stuffed animals), and the seller had included a small gift in the box as thanks. The kids didn’t notice as they ran off to play, and I had gifted the box to them straight after delivery without checking first. I learned my lesson there. So I left the box on the floor and went to the washroom.

When I came out, I saw a scorpion in the middle of the floor (I live in NM so this is not impossible as I checked to see if it was actually a Scorpion and not a Child Of The Earth), and once I confirmed the tail, I SCREAMED for my husband who came running with the mom of my kid’s best friend right behind him.

They, too, freaked out once they saw it and my husband ran to get a cup as our friend kept our kids from entering the room to see what I had screamed at.

I’m frozen in the doorway of the bathroom, too terrified to move lest it struck me in the foot, and because I was so hyper focused on the scorpion in case it moved toward me, I didn’t immediately notice Biscus enter the room right in front of my husband until I saw her approach the scorpion as I screamed, “BISCUS, LEAVE IT!” 

Too late, I gasped in horror as I saw Biscus bite it. I lunged toward her to finger scoop it out of her mouth when she cocked her head and dropped it, the heavy plastic of the scorpion creating a loud THUNK as it hit the hardwood floor. 

T.S.Agent Biscus had confiscated it from the box left on the floor and nearly gave all of us a heart attack.
$C: I read an article on Facebook that I really, really liked because in a way, it kept the magic of Christmas alive. A mom, facing similar questions from her child, decided to tell her child they were finally old enough to be let in on the secret of Santa. And she explained that Santa is not a jolly man in a red suit but rather, Santa is all of US. We choose someone who we think needs some Christmas magic, and we purchase a special gift for them and deliver it anonymously and tag it From Santa. The purpose is to make them feel loved and appreciated. 

The original article explained it much better, but I really liked the idea of turning around what feels like a mean lie into something heartwarming that highlights the good and the generosity of people belonging to a special secret club.

I’ll try to find the original link and share it. 

Edit: Here is the article I read!

$C: Dad of a 6 year old. This one helped me out.

$C: I got my son convinced that Santa is actually a vampire
$C: Deputy Biscus turned 11 years old in November. She’s is still puppy in a lot of ways, though!
$C: I deem him.....SIR Biscus, Dog of the Realm, Eater of Sausages and Chicken Last Bites.

$C: "You see my old friend, at the end of all of this, I will be the only one with the cure for this disease. And all the world will have to come to me to ask for it. They shall get it of course, I am not a monster. But there will be a price."

"Why... Why are you telling me this? You know I'm going to have to stop you."

"I know you will old friend. You are ethical as the sun is bright. That's why, even though today will be my greatest achievement, there will be a great sadness over it. That confectionary you are eating, with the marzipan you love so much was made just for you. You may have noticed I have not touched it. That is because I made it with bitter almonds. Rather fitting for today. As a botanist, I am sure you know what that means. If there is anything I can do to comfort you, please let me know."



Edit: as far as I know, not from anything (or adapted from anything) and I haven't seen the Godfather or read Spiderman. But I wouldn't be surprised if I was subconsciously adapting something, while basing it on the fact that bitter almonds contain a decent amount of cyanide, unlike the sweet almonds we know and love. But thanks for liking this so much. 
$C: It's treason then.
$C: Nothing personal. It’s just science.
$C: Not. Yet.
$C: MY LAB-OR-A-TORY

$C: You misunderstood.

What I was suggesting is that his study propose from the outset to be an assessment of existing patient data using an alternative analysis.

No new data:  Same bipolar surveys, same final diagnosis

No new data releases: Same doctors and interns that current have access to the data as part of their daily duties.

The only difference would be that the old data would be re-assessed for correlations between the survey and the final diagnosis.

$C: You're obviously not an engineer. 
$C: That's a good one
$C: Wasn’t a lot also taken from from the imperial Japanese experiments as well? 
$C: When your burned you've got nothing. No cash, no credit, no job history.
$C: >Buncha bitchy little girls 
$C: On point
$C: "I'm not a pedantic douche", as well as that, you know nothing about science. 
$C: Hmm, I guess so. Good point
$C: Yeah, that'll be it. Good one. 
$C: "Fuck off" oooh sorry
$C: I'm 26 and my parents put Santa on our gifts. 
$C: My siblings and I went along with the whole thing for years. My parents loved overhyping Santa and the holidays and it was just always this unspoken thing that even though we were all aware, we just let it ride for the sake of what the fuck ever. Found out my mom didn't realize we were playing the part when I heard her telling her friend that she still had her kids believing in Santa. I was 17 at this point. Wtf mom. 
$C: Ok, but if your kid is 15 and still acting like santa is real you are at least going to be thinking that if they really believe it something might be wrong with them. 
$C: Just so long as they admit they know the Elf is a shame. Moving that damn thing on a regular basis is a PITA.
$C: I could tell my dad was embarrassed that I was still pretending when I was 7.
$C: Y5 
$C: That might even make him a prophet!  Wikipedia says born 270 AD and died 343 AD.

$C: No, not at all.

I don't make fun of people for their faith or lack thereof. However, there is one group of people (particularly on Reddit) that doesn't hesitate to be a total dick about shoving their opinions on others, and that is atheists.

Be an atheist if you want. That said, don't make fun of people for their religion and I won't make fun of atheism. Not that complicated.

Your asshole reply just proves my point.
$C: Well, all I can say is that great for you- that was my reality and I don’t regret it. I had a lot going on at the time and it gave me some hope.

(Note, I am not religious, though my background is Catholic.) 
$C: I don't know, I don't know anyone Norwegian so I never asked. I would assume Norway is like us. I honestly never thought about this stuff in so much detail. We learn when we are young that all anglosaxian countries celebrate Christmas a day late, on the 25th, while Latin America are in between aka late at night on the 24th or just after midnight when 25th begins.

Other trivia: from what I've understood, we used to have a Christmas goat giving out the presents until 18th century or so, something to do with people knocking on doors, leaving a present and then running off before you were spotted, and the knock sounding like hooves. 

I also think santa wore grey until the early 20th century.

When my dad was a child in the early 1950s, santa always arrived in a horse drawn sleigh, and he could hear the jingle bells as he arrived. *sigh* When I was a child, santa drove my grandpa's car. 






$C: Swedish men saying "if you do my house I'll do yours" sounds familiar... 
$C: You have to admit, it *is* an easy win
$C: And the science gets done...
$C: Okay, Roy Moore
$C: I don't know man, there was a lady who touched Jesus and she was healed. There was also Moses who couldn't even see God's face and survive. Imagine what might have happened if he touched God :O
$C: Because she'll be happier if she picks a field and her parents support her choice rather than push her towards a field of their choosing. People rarely know what they really want to do when they're 18, yet alone when they're 5 years old. 
$C: >  She is super excited about it though, she met some dude dressed as an elf at a store who gave her a free toy (he worked at the store) and she was telling me all about how she met a real elf.

And that's the reason for the smoke and mirrors, seeing the joy on kids' faces is so worth it.
$C: That's the kind of magic I would want, but the cost of deception seems so steep, even as someone who believed as a kid. How can you keep that magic alive without Santa, though?


I'm glad your daughter is so excited. Kindness like that elf's are what I love so much about the holiday.
$C: Not here...the power of repression! Wahoo!
$C: I've always bought the "unconventional" christmas presents for my daughters, microscopes, chemistry sets, etc. If it was "girly" , like a doll house, It was one that you had to assemble, with wiring and lights. I've carried that over to my granddaughters, I've bought see-through engines, USB microscopes, kiddie kayaks, hiking boots, bib overalls and for christmas this year I'm giving them a 6" dobsonian telescope. It's all about making learning FUN ! Now we have a lawyer, and 2 Vet Techs for daughters, we won't go into the animals we've had over the years.
$C: Make sure she knows math, CS and physics are also open to her and that not all science degrees lead to teaching positions. The scientific method serves many fields. She should take her time finding out which one gets her up in the morning excited for another day.
$C: And now I'm picturing a scene where, with bright Christmas lights and decorations, elf clumsily sprawled on the floor, mother crying and seven year-old daughter screaming in terror and regret, and above it all, Morgan Freeman's voice-over: "...and that was the true magic of Christmas..." 
$C: Thank you for understanding what I meant. It's a game, if the kids break the rules, you have to restart the game.
$C: Presumably because it’s not a “2 line joke over a reusable character,” a rule in that sub.
$C: At that point why not just give them a conditional allowance? Do you chores and get your allowance then spend that allowance however you want.
$C: Wow well put. Would you ever consider writing a guide on parenting or anything?
$C: Would you, though, when at the end of the year the stuff *does* show up?
$C: That makes sense. I think as long as you’re certain that they love you and think highly of you, even if they can’t afford something, you’re going to be okay. I just think the phrasing matters, but as long as they got their point across, no harm no foul. My parents didn’t indulge my every whim either. It’s just the idea of “deserving” it or not makes it seem like they think you’re not good enough if they can’t afford something. I know that I was always seeking my parents’ approval, and if they told me that I didn’t deserve something, I’d be crushed. They just phrased it differently and told me that some things were too expensive, or were only for special occasions, or had to be earned with good grades and chores, etc. As long as the kid understands that not getting a toy is not a reflection of their inherent worth, which it seems like you understood anyways. Other kids might take it differently, though, which is why I’d hesitate to recommend that.
$C: But it can also make poorer kids feel bad when their friends get the new 1000 dollar gift, and they get socks. 
$C: What happens when two kids talk at school about what Santa got them: one got a PS4 Pro, and one got a Tesco Skateboard. That kid who got the skateboards gonna think Santa's a right prick.
$C: Santa at my house always filled the stockings and gave the big ticket, expensive gift.  But just the one big gift per person.  Other gifts that were more reasonably priced/not as exciting were wrapped by parents and put under the tree.  I think that system worked out well because it kept the wonder of "Oh my goodness look at how amazing Santa is" but also allowed the parents to pile presents under the tree and create excitement for the kids that way too.  What could be in this DVD sized box?  Is it that movie I wanted?  Is it that Xbox game?  I don't know, but it's for me and it's making me excited.
$C: The Easter Bunny brought my neighbors new bikes every single year. My mom had to try to explain to me why the easter bunny doesn't give me presents. 
$C: On the flip side why not teach them that from the beginning, i rather teach my son about the fact we do all this for Christmas for him early so he can learn multiple lessons (one included he gets a budget for his Christmas presents and because his birthday is close to Christmas he can combine budgets) 

Honestly i never gave a shit about Santa as a kid because growing up knowing the extra effort my parents put into Chritsmas just felt special and there was no need to delay that for 3/4 of a decade just to maintain a silly story. I was a bit of a brat who never fully appreciated presents(but boy could i pretend to), i knew my parents could not afford the stuff i wanted but santa could; my auntie broke the illusion of Santa before i was 5 and i still feel it was the right decision, shit taught me some humility and how to actually be a bit more grateful.
$C: When I figured out that Santa isn't real, I didn't appreciate the gifts more. I just felt kinda betrayed and confused because my parents had been lying to me all this time. How could they have been saying I should not lie, and punish me when I lied about something to try and get out of trouble, and then they go and lie about Santa for seemingly no good reason. 

Why would they give me this thing to believe in, knowing that one day I will find out and feel disappointed that it was all fake. What is there to be gained?

I honestly don't know what I'll do when I have my own kids in a few years. I don't like the idea of teaching them that lying is bad, and then lie about Santa's existence. I personally didn't care where the gifts came from, just as long as I got gifts, I was grateful. 

But it's not a simple decision because it doesn't just affect me and my family. By telling my kids about Santa being fake, they will spoil it for other kids at school and that's not a decision I can make for other families. Not when the majority of society is pro Santa.
$C: Nothing to do with pride in my case. Santa cares about you, he bought you all these thoughtful, fun little gifts on theme, he's someone friendly, a magical gift elf, and then, your parents who love you bought you something at cost to themselves and deserve thanks and respect.

This should be the season of respect, love and compassion, because the sun is gone, its cold, and the crops are gone, so we need to strengthen our bond to each other. All of the holiday answers in our lives should fit the criteria of offering love, respect, compassion to ourselves and each other. The *ourselves* is as important as the *each other*. Wanting respect and appreciation from your children isn't unreasonable. It is arguably an equal gift to a popsicle-stick and paper-lace angel with sloppy glitter on it. 
$C: I disagree, depending on the child. Story goes one Christmas when I was three, my mom asked me how I liked my gifts after they were all opened and I started crying. When asked why, I said, "mommy and daddy didn't get me anything!" So after that the stockings and the 1 'big' present for each me, my brother, and my sister by the fireplace was from Santa. Everything under the tree was my from parents. I think that was an awesome system that was the best of both worlds.
$C: You can afford an arm?
$C: Not making it up, I can take a picture of the shoes if you want, not that it’d really prove how old they are. It’d be a weird thing to lie about I agree but I can’t exactly prove they’re as old as I say 
$C: Big difference between a nice pair of seasonal boots and everyday wear sneakers. Also I think we can safely assume this was the only pair of shoes he owned throughout those 12 years as the point he was making was that he never asked his parents for anything, which makes owning the same pair of shoes for that long basically impossible.
$C: Pics or it didnt happen
$C: Its pretty unbelievable that your feet havent grown since you were twelve. Unless youre like fourteen right now.
$C: Exactly the same I face !
$C: No I understood what you meant. I'm sorry I wasn't clear. I just didn't understand the personal anecdotal parts of your comment. I think it might just be that we use different slang terms or something. I'm the same way when it comes to money for similar reasons from childhood, so I agree with ya
$C: Nope. Not numbers. Just people who know each other.
$C: hold my non-existent rabbit hole, i'm going in!
$C: I'm 34 and my son is 16...  Not sure what that has to do with anything though.
$C: > “ugh, Santa is not even fuckin real.” I want the credit.

i'm not OP but cursing at a 6 year old and demanding credit doesn't exactly sound like you are fun parent. it really isn't the one comment. it is the multiple comments you posted here defending yourself over it too. if you weren't a jew, santa would mark you on the naughty list ;)

$C: Jesus’s birth, Christmas carols such as O Come All Ye Faithful, Hark! The Herald Angels Sing, Silent Night, and Away in a Manger. Even Santa is based off St. Nicholas. Candy canes are actually a J for Jesus as well.
$C: If someone needs to lie to their kids to create a "sense of wonder and magic" then they should probably reconsider parenting.  I've met a lot of people with familial dysfunction — hard to identify how much lying about Santa vs other things contributed to it, but none are acceptable.
$C: Aaayyy. All the reindeer who be thinking we soft.
$C: This comment is so underrated 
$C: Moke weed erday
$C: Jolly bottom girls, you make the rockin' world go round.... 
$C: My wife’s name is Jolly!
$C: LANAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
$C: Take me to bed or lose me forever.
$C: Tip top bee bop zu bop of the tiers.
$C: Let me remind you of the comment chain you are presently on...

First comment:

>"Yeah, I suspect this will be one of the most upvoted posts in Reddit history"

I can't upvote a logical misstep. That's all. The movie was good choice and it is novel that OP thought to address children having logical arguments about Santa, but other than that... I'm out.
$C: I'd say. Came up with it in a GIFfy.

Oh wait...
$C: That method works on adults too
$C: Well yeah, I get that. I'm not a parent either but I've been around kids alot so I know it's not easy. Just do your best and hope for the best 
$C: I wasn't really hit much as a kid at all, I was very fortunate in that regard, though I did suffer a little verbal abuse from my father, like him calling me a pussy when I was just a little kid, and I mean very young, like single digits age. It wasn't that bad though, I suppose. What I'm getting at though, is that I just don't see how anyone can grow up to be violent, especially to their kids! Whether they were beat or not, I just don't get it. I can't even hit animals really, let alone other humans, it just makes me feel horrible. Maybe it has something to do with how I treated my nephew though growing up (we lived together for most of our lives and we're more like brothers, only separated by a little over 3 years of age). I was always a douchebag to him, and we often fought with each other, I've had regrets from it for years now.
$C: >I'm not big on whipping

Well, that's a decent conclusion 
$C: Yeah no, that's not how people generally work. Why do you think atheists are viewed in a bad light in general? People think, "What? They don't fear God or hell? Or karma? What stops them from doing bad shit then?!". Same with people with ASPD. We typically lack affective empathy and people hear that and instantly demonize us all as monsters because to them, if doing bad shit doesn't make you feel bad, what incentive do you have to do good? It's just how people generally are
$C: But is it necessary to bribe them like that? I mean the rest of the world doesn't 
$C: Damn that’s depressing. If my little dude wasn’t asleep I’d go push him out of his bed. 
$C: Ah, good old Douglas Adams.
$C: Thank you!  Whatever’s clever, and the same to you.  Oddly enough, I have a tree and go all out decoration-wise.  I love the holidays, I just don’t consider them holy days, lol.
$C: No, that's/r/bettereveryloop
$C: My soul is shuddering. 
$C: Do you say "gift" or "jift"?  That's the word that's spelled as closely as possible to the .gif.
$C: Hey, you can't look a gift girafe in the mouth
$C: Stupid long horses
$C: Are you sure it wasn’t Greg?
$C: I don't, what, what are you? 

It starts with the letter G!
Do you eat Jumbo?!
Do you like Dojs?!
Do you like Jiraffes?!
$C: He lost the right when he made the wrong decision. The phoneme 'jif' is already a thing. It's a brand of peanut butter, and a unit of time. Gif is not anything, so it makes sense, if we're picking the pronunciation of a thing, for it to be an unused phoneme rather than something with multiple uses.

Plus, and this is anecdotal, nobody says 'jif' when they mean 'gif'. The public has spoken. 
$C: > That leaves the possibility of it healing if he's lucky. What do you want to investigate?

I'd like to know if we can "program" our bodies with our mind, or alter our physiology with our brain.

There probably have been lots of studies in this regard, and since we don't have a lot of peer-reviewed published articles, I'd say we haven't been that successful yet. But it's hard to believe, from all the anecdotal evidence, that it's just "luck" that someone is completely healed of some fatal malady without traditional treatment of any kind. I'm saying, we can't just write it off to "luck" because there's no such thing (in science).

HOW do these people get healed, and HOW can we take advantage of that process?
$C: Very well-worded. Thank you. My opinion has changed.
$C: It should be obvious to reddit that she wouldn't do that shit, she's just saying that it would make her angry. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: My 4 year old loves Christmas. He helps me putt up all the decorations. We have a Christmas nativity pyramid from Germany he is mesmerized by. His face lights up at the thought of giving a "surprise" to some one. And he helps me make cookies every year for our friends and neighbors, (and of course Santa)

Kids will react to what you do, if you make it fun and exciting they will also find it exciting. If you are stressed and show angst ever year they will do the same.
$C: Because they are 4. And to a 4 year old, a 12 year old is an adult, and they're taught to believe adults. 
$C: So is religion if you really think about it. Like it really serves no objective purpose in a child's life. I think it's pretty sad that lying to your children about something so dumb in the first place is commonplace in a first world society but hey, those are just my thoughts, some random dude you don't know ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Different strokes for different folks
$C: [deleted]
$C: Overdramatic much?
$C: Or if they're one and the same person you can just give one big tip
$C: They both get tips .
One gets tipped and one gets the tip. 
Who gets which one is on the individual.
$C: Oops. Fucked the delivery guy and made the 'toot go get me dinner. Didn't seem right.
$C: With a big enough tip your pizza delivery driver may very well take your other “big tip”.
$C: TBH, you give the prostitute a different kind of tip.

Unless, you have *that* kind of pizza guy.
$C: Worst. Teacher. Ever.
$C: "If you really squint, it kinda looks like a boob."
$C: VoiceofLou is right. Trust me. ;)
$C: I'm ususally not even horny when I play with myself... just bored...

so that would make a LOT of questionable things porn D:
$C: Surprisingly accurate. 
$C: That silly. The human eye can't see more than 6,000 fps.
$C: Exactly, how do they expect to reroute the encryptions?
$C: > Webm is the container used for native html5 playback and is the one gfycat and imgur use

Webm is only one of the supported container formats. MP4 is the other one. webm is preferred by firefox because of the patent problems. In my case (as seen by the media info output I posted), imgur delivered an MP4 file.

> (youtube uses its own vp9 because they are retarded

VP9 is the successor of VP8, so I would not call it retarded.
$C: > Also GIFs have zero inter-frame compression

No but they support variable sized frame regions, which is very efficient and usually outperforms regular video codecs if only a small region like a mouse cursor changes between frames. If this is the case for most of your recording, the gif will be massively smaller

EDIT: Here's an example of a gif that probably outperforms most video codecs: https://i.imgur.com/SvDL0Ni.gif  
It the loading speed of the bootstrap framework over a 56k connection. it's 90 kb only. This makes it smaller than the framework it showcases and fast enough to be loaded over 56k in real time. Not that this has been a criteria for the last 17 years.
$C: Just like the Al Pacino "courtroom" scene at the end of "Scent of a Woman".  It's an amazing scene and great speech, but without the full build up and history of the characters from the rest of the film, you just don't get the full impact of what he's doing.
$C: Alright, thanks!
$C: But Santa would have come and left by then..
$C: This scene is so good, if I watch it a few more times I will have memorized the entire exchange of these two men by heart.

The fight between Luke and the Emperor and Vader in the Imperial throneroom is also a great scene.  I've watched that play out so many times that i've memorized the whole thing by heart.  All their lines, perfect timing, perfect gravitas, complete with hand gestures!  Fuck yeah I'm so high right now!
$C: Then watch the courtroom scene from the Simpsons episode "Sideshow Bob Roberts", which is a great parody of this.
$C: haha, I didnt realize that was a line from the movie. im actually a 19 year old college sophomore. This movie is 6 years older than me.
$C: dammmmmnmn, thats crazy dude. Thats got to be some sort of record man.
$C: looks fantastic 
$C: I definitely think I will. My dad was raving about the movie just a second ago when I asked him lol.
$C: Murder too
$C: ahaha yes I did - but if there exists a 'Garden Space' I want to know about it now.  Garden State is the only movie I can ever think of that I watched three times in the space of two days of seeing it the first time.

It's not so much a typo as a brain-keyboard aphasia, which happens a lot with me :)
$C: Yep. It's kind of a scary thought that old farts like me know of these films off the back of our hands but there is an entire generation who haven't. But thats getting old for you.
$C: The films rated R, so the quick answer would be 15. Obviously that depends on how much the guy at the theatre gave a shit back in 1993 but lets assume even a peach-fuzzed 14 year old with a parent could see it.

Now obviously you could say with the advent of the internet and the movie appearing on cable TV multiple times that number is kind of meaningless. It's more a case of, if you hadn't seen the film back then and it wasn't suggested to you, how likely are you to just stumble upon it if you were born after 2000? 
$C: I haven't seen the movie in almost a decade and I still remember almost every line from this scene.
$C: Worst show ever made! All it taught my son was how to be a bitch and piss and moan when you don't get your way. Any parent that lets there kid watch this definitely hasn't watched an episode. My son likes Horrid Henry, which, don't get me wrong, he does bad shit, but he gets punished every single episode so I think its introducing negative reinforcement. But fuck Calliou. 
$C: This reads like a children’s book......and a good one.  If you start now it can be out in time for next Christmas.

I like the TSA agent twist because I always say she’s our “little investigator” - of every smell, noise, bump, thump and thud.  Or she’s our “little bomb sniffer” the moment a package or new grocery bag arrives.

Seeing as how she has never let one bomb get past the door I think she’s due for a promotion.  TSA Agent Biscuits.  Though I’m not sure I want my dog associated with such a spotty organization......though she can be pretty lazy!
$C: My mom just said something along the lines of "Don't tell me Santa isn't real, you think those presents just appeared magically? Someone put them there. It just wasn't a guy in a red suit. It's just not who you thought it was."
$C: I just solved the problem by never lying to my kids about Santa in the first place. 

Instead my daughter came home from kindergarten hopping mad because her teacher told her Santa was real and she thought her dad and I had been, I don't know, keeping her presents or something.
$C: That does not prepare them for life and enforces a romantisized version of the world. Congratz, you turned your daughter in to the girl from the movie traffic.
$C: Great advice you linked to. But you had to explain to your six-year-old? That’s pretty young isn’t it? My daughter didn’t figure it out until about 8 and still plays along knowingly now, at ten. 
$C: Six years old and not believing in Santa? That makes me sad. My oldest is 5 and he's soooo excited about Santa! I want the magic to last! 


I was 8 when I had a suspicion, so I asked for a bell from Santa's sleigh. And I got it! A big shiny brass bell in my stocking, engraved. I believed so much at that moment! I probably really figured it out before the next year, but that moment was magical. (And I'm impressed with my mom's skills finding that in the days before the internet.) I still have it, I show it to my kids every year.

$C: One of the problem was the test in question was being applied somewhat sporadically. Getting the consultant to make it part of standard assesment so that you can later look back at the data is still unethical fraud no matter what if your intent is to later go back and use it for research later. 

No matter how you twist and turn it and believe me many researchers try to justify it to themselves as such. The IRB system is broken because you have to do it arse backwards like that to get anything done.

$C: If you're going to talk about something on Reddit, you're inviting everyone on Reddit to comment on it. If you bring up God on a post about a little girl realizing that Santa isn't real, you're bringing it on yourself. If you want to believe in magic and you also don't want anyone to tell you that you believe in magic, you can't bring it up to people. 
$C: And you make a neat gun
$C: No telling what she'd cut off of him as an experiment.
$C: Happy cake day! 🍰 
$C: The one thing she’s been consistently interested in for 3 years now is biology. Specifically, she finds white blood cells and the brain fascinating. Her interest began when she was diagnosed with epilepsy and ADHD. After a rough start with misunderstandings among her peers in kindergarten, she asked me HOW to explain to them that she’s not trying to be rude or ignore them and that she IS a nice girl and NOT stupid.
I said the best way is to first learn about epilepsy and her type of seizures, know it well, and then teach them. Let them ask questions. 

So that’s what she did and with the teacher’s permission, she made a presentation to the class (with help from me), and in the process of doing that, she developed a keen interest in the brain. White blood cells followed soon after when she wanted to continue exploring the human body. 

That could still change down the road but as of right now, that’s the longest held interest thus far. 
$C: You'd think they'd keep it up when it was doing so well
$C: That’s basically what my parents did. It’s the same concept.

You just don’t want to tie the kid’s sense of self-worth to their material possessions though. 
$C: The issue with conditional allowances tied to chores is that it makes chores optional.  Chores are not optional, it’s what you have to do as a member of the household.  As a kid, my room was my job and I got paid if I cleaned more than that.  When I didn’t need the money, I stopped cleaning.

My kid is six.  He earns money by doing his reading (homework) every night.  He’s tired at the end of the day, he lacks confidence and gives up easy.  He’s gotten so much better when we push him.  I figure if I stop paying, he’ll still know how to read.  So far that’s working out great.
$C: Given that I don’t have kids and I’m barely an adult myself, I haven’t lol. But that’s very kind of you.
$C: Step 1: don't shake the baby

Step 2: the baby is not washing machine safe. 

Step 3: teach them independence 

Step 4: teach them hard work and the value of money

Step 5: teach them how to play Xbox poorly so you can continue beating them for a couple more years

Step 6: if you can, start a savings account for them. Make them deposit money whenever they can. Teach them how to actually save, and go without buying stuff they really don't need. 

Step 7: puberty! Good luck.

Step 8: still puberty. You're hair is getting kinda grey...

Step 9: teach them how to write a check, invest money properly, about good financial practices, how to start a 401k/retirement plan, etc. This one is important. Hammer this shit through their thick skulls. Financial responsibility is one of the least taught things in America. 

Step 10: cry that they're moving out/ going to college

Step 11: cry that you only get to see them a couple times of year since they live and work a couple states away. 

Step 12: cry because you know you did a good job raising and loving them, and that you set them up for a good life. 

Step 13: say "I told you so" when they finally realize that you were actually right about something.

Step 14: ???

Step 15: profit
$C: Yes, because they’ve still spent a year hearing that they don’t deserve things that make them happy. It’s not about the stuff. The parents could have just said “no”. It’s telling them that they don’t deserve it that’s the problem.
$C: True true, I feel that my parents incorporated it more when I hadn’t been that great that day. So like me asking for candy or a small toy when in the same morning I had talked back to my mom.. them asking that question both reminded me of my past action being bad and also made me a bit humble. 
$C: That was my experience growing up. Santa bought me boots and some nice clothes, and I thought that was great. But then after vacation my friends would talk about how they got a new console or games, and I distinctly remember thinking I just wasn't good enough that year.

I love my parents and everything they did for me, and it wasn't their fault at all. But I had to have the illusion ruined kind of early for me because of it.
$C: Johnny: Mom?  
Mom: Yes, Johnny?  
Johnny: Why does Tim across the street get nicer presents from Santa then me?  
Mom: I don't know. When your dad wakes up from his nap, ask him.
$C: Sorry, I didn't think that way as a kid and I'm not used to that type of thinking.  I came from a working class family who was just above being poor, never thought that.  

> That kid who got the skateboards gonna think Santa's a right prick.

Unless of course, that kid asked for the skateboard and cares more about that, than video games.  Or maybe they can just appreciate what they got and not compare to others?  
$C: That’s ridiculous. 
$C: > On the flip side why not teach them that from the beginning,

What's the advantage of doing that?  

>  i rather teach my son about the fact we do all this for Christmas for him early so he can learn multiple lessons (one included he gets a budget for his Christmas presents and because his birthday is close to Christmas he can combine budgets) 

From a developmental standpoint, you are wasting your time.  It would be better to teach them these things when they are capable of retaining it. 
$C: I'm exactly the same. As with most 'mythical' creatures, they need to realise the world isn't unicorns and butterflies or it's just going to hurt worse when the curtain gets ripped away.
$C: > When I figured out that Santa isn't real, I didn't appreciate the gifts more.

Why?

I just felt kinda betrayed and confused because my parents had been lying to me all this time. How could they have been saying I should not lie, and punish me when I lied about something to try and get out of trouble, and then they go and lie about Santa for seemingly no good reason.

Because lying to create wonder and excitement is the same as lying to get out of trouble???  How did you not realize it like most kids, and then say to yourself, "I'm gonna keep the charade going as long as possible," like the vast majority of kids do?  Why in the world was it such a big deal?  

> Why would they give me this thing to believe in, knowing that one day I will find out and feel disappointed that it was all fake.

Why wouldn't you appreciate all the extra effort of your parents in making Christmas a magical time???  I don't get your line of thinking.  Kids deserve a childhood of wonder, and maturing should end it.  

> I personally didn't care where the gifts came from, just as long as I got gifts, I was grateful.

Except when they were marked as "santa" according to you.  Somehow that was really bad and hurt you...
$C: > your parents who love you bought you something at cost to themselves and deserve thanks and respect.

They will come to realize this when they grow out of believing in Santa, and appreciate everything you did even more.  Letting Santa get the credit for the "best" gift isn't teaching them to not respect you.  It doesn't teach them to not appreciate the gift.  

> This should be the season of respect, love and compassion,

You left out giving.

> It is arguably an equal gift to a popsicle-stick and paper-lace angel with sloppy glitter on it.

What???  Equal to what? Is this a kid being sloppy or the parent?  If it's the kid, obviously a homemade present is awesome and should be treated as such.  
$C: See, I'm not saying only Santa, I'm just saying, it makes sense that he would be the one giving the cool present, not the parents.  Parents definitely should still have their own presents to the kids too. 
$C: Yeah but it cost me an arm and a leg.
$C: I believe you but I’m curious to see the shoes anyway because it’s such an unusual thing to keep wearing them for so long. If you do feel like uploading a pic, I’d love to see it
$C: Yup, you’re totally right. I’ve had a million pairs of good quality sneakers fall apart during the same interval because they get more wear. I agree that it’s implausible, but who knows.
$C: I’m 26, but I developed early and I’ve been 5’11” since the 7th grade. Size 12 shoes. I’ve gone through a million pairs of sneakers, but my winter boots and my Batman chucks from middle school are fine. Females also tend to hit puberty earlier and stop growing earlier than males, so I’m assuming that’s part of it.
$C: I’m a girl and I’m 4’10 I stopped growing when I hit puberty at 11 
$C: Cursing at my kids? You guys take everything too literal. You’re right, why do I even bother? Just get off my lawn and go home you young-ins. 
$C: 1. That was in September or October. Late December was picked to coincide with an existing pagan holiday to make conversions easier. Not Christian

2. Fair enough, though tbh I never really paid much attention to the lyrics of most of them

3. In what way? His gift giving I guess (though lots of historical and mythical figures are known for similar, so that seems pretty generic), but everything else (fat jolly old white man from the North Pole? Magical elves and reindeer? Chimneys?) is new. The character bares much more resemblance to Odin, with the finer details filled in from popular advertising material by Coca Cola and other companies in the 1930s

4. That is quite a stretch. Citation needed?
$C: Let me answer that for you, it's 0% Santa, 100% other family issues.

$C: I say gift, but I also don't really care enough about this issue to have an opinion. I'm just gonna stick with how the creator of the gif says it's pronounced.
$C: I say gift. Thats why i say jif, so people don't get confused and think i said gift
$C: In different scenarios, the g does take a soft sound it's not unheard of, and it's what the original programmer was going for. He even cracked the joke that "choosy programmers choose gif."

Also, was your last example supposed to be a joke, or was I just wooshed?

That said, as a soldier, I'm not at all put off by the depiction of the military in the film, even if it's not stellar. I'll take A Few Good Men over Jarhead- heck, over Jack Reacher- any day. But I did love Jack Reacher.

$C: To be fair, the public has managed to change dictionaries left and right with either mispronunciations, misuses,  and/or new words. 
$C: He can absolutely continue to say jif when he means gif, that's his right and I'm not the kind of guy to go around slapping gifs out of people's hands. 

But Apple wasn't deciding the pronunciation of a new word. Their logo is an actual apple. Gif isn't a thing. There is no Gif fruit that inspired the name, the source is an initialism for Graphics Interchange Format. So, when the acronym is a *totally new word*, it makes sense to pronounce it in a way that doesn't conflict with other words.

P.s. Much like the 'is a hotdog a sandwich' debate (it isn't), and the blue/black vs gold/white dress debate (its gold/white, I don't care what the original dress color is, the photograph as presented clearly shows white and gold tones, so the answer to the question "what color is the dress in this photograph" is gold/white), I don't actually *care* about this. It's just really fun to argue about.
$C: > There was never a fatal malady, just a good chance he'd never walk again. His body was able to heal through processes which we already well understand. There isn't even anecdotal evidence to go off. Bodies heal after injuries. That's what they do.

Healing without medical treatment is the exception, not the norm. You say bodies heal after injuries. Sure. Most of the time, not optimally. I'm thinking of significant damage, like broken bones. Sure, it will "heal." But you'll be crippled (or worse) for life. The guy in OP had compressed vertebrae that required metal scaffolding to fix properly, or he'd never walk again. Well... I guess not.

Cancer has been healed without traditional treatment. How can we trigger that response in everyone? Is everyone capable of that? Does the mind play a role in these healings?

There are ebola survivors who still aren't susceptible to getting the disease. Why? How can we give that immunity to everyone?

I'm not saying there's no value in traditional treatments. Obviously, there are. What I'm saying is, there have got to be [unknown, bodily functions](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=medical+mysteries&ia=web) we can tap into for even better treatments for damage to our bodies.

Consider savants. They are evidence that our brains are significantly more capable than any individual is able to exercise. That guy who can fly over a city and then draw it? The guy who can play complicated musical masterpieces on piano after hearing it once? I want my brain to do that!

That's not true. WebM and MP4 are two completely different container formats. In the case of this post at least, imgur delivers an MP4 container with an AVC video track (as shown in my info dump a few posts earlier).

For youtube it's a little bit more complex. if they deliver webm or mp4 primarily depends on the maximum available resolution (720p and lower is mp4, higher is webm usually). For video id `u1_a-KsqKiY`, they delivered an MP4 container, for `maniMjcvS7M` a webm container.
The webm video codec was VP9, the MP4 codec is AVC-[DASH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP)

$C: Thank you, very much. That means a lot, sincerely. I’ve been going through a lot of stuff lately that has made me feel guilty, thinking I haven’t been a very good mom lately. 

I try very hard to be involved with my kids and to keep their childhood well, a childhood. But there are days when my lupus symptoms flair up and I’m just so, so exhausted and I have to postpone plans or take a nap while they’re cooped up in the house for a few days because I don’t feel safe to drive, etc. Truthfully, my feeling disturbed by her Squint experiments was because of this guilt I’ve been carrying lately and anyway, these comments have helped me forgive myself a wee bit and remember the sayings that boredom helps creativity, imagination, etc.

Thank you. 
$C: No, she’s not a genius. But she has incredible focus and memorization skills when it’s something she’s very interested in and determined to learn. Having seizures is very scary, especially with all the tests, medications, etc. ADHD can also be frustrating, feeling like you’re always getting in trouble but you’re ‘not doing it on purpose!’  She truly wanted to understand what was happening and why.

Here are pictures of her [talking to her class about epilepsy ](https://imgur.com/gallery/dDUB5) . The drum represents the MRI machine she demonstrated with a stuffed animal. I helped her make brain hats and it was her idea to use pipe cleaners to represent neurotransmitters and little pompoms to represent neurons. 

My daughter still struggles with remembering to start her writing at the red line, spacing, when to capitalize and use punctuation because to her, it’s boring and slows her down. She has her strengths and challenges in subjects like anyone else.
$C: Sounds like you found out when you were too young or immature then.  I'm sorry for you.

$C: It's just one of those things that people will forever disagree on, no hard feelings friend.   I have a friend at work whose name is Greg and he prefers the hard-G in gif (go figure).    I gave up on caring about words when everyone decided "literally" means both "literally" and  "figuratively," lol
$C: Oh?
$C: Oh I know. Thanks. I just think that when a guy makes something he can kind of call it what he wants. It's a goofy thing to even argue about. I think people pronounce it with a hard G and then find out it's a soft G and make their argument because they don't want to have been wrong all that time. They're used to the way they've been pronouncing it.

$C: How is being a blunt dick even remotely the same as telling the truth? The truth is they lost weight and that’s the conversation topic. You aren’t lying by agreeing. Way to come up with the worst example possible just to throw a terrible insult in there

You know what is lying? Actively telling your kids Santa exists when he doesn’t. I’m not saying whether you should or shouldn’t, but that’s intentional lying.
$C: You're an ass. 
$C: I didn't claim anything about Santa. All his statement was, was "you tell the truth even when it makes you a dick?" and my reply was that most people are taught that telling the truth, and accepting the consequences as a result, is being a good person. 

I feel like belief in Santa is something that should be left to individual families. I love dressing up and playing Santa during Christmas when I go to a family party, but I probably won't emphasize his existence or anything with my own kids. I always knew as a kid that my parents were the ones giving the presents, I was the curious type that would find them way before the holiday no matter where they hid them.
$C: But... Do I fuck the prostitute or eat the pizza first?
$C: Well, if you're going to deliver pizza and pussy, you should add pot. 
$C: That way you have hot pizza ready and waiting when you finish... after all, let’s face it.  Post of y’all only take a couple minutes anyway.    
$C: What's great is that the pizza wouldn't even get cold before *you* finish
$C: In some places paying for sex is legal as long as you don't advertise, promote or pimp
$C: WAIT WAIT WAIT. This is the loophole. Like how pornography is legal because you film it. The hooer delivers the pizza. She may or may not have sex with you but she definitely will, just because she feels like it and that's her choice. Then you tip her whatever, a few hundies if it was decent or just a twenty if it was a quick handy and she was busted up.

$C: Even IF she did talk to her class about epilepsy, you know as well as I do that your 'elf' story is pure bullshit. You didn't notice the elf's hands were tied? Also no 7 year old calls a house meeting. Or if she's that smart she'd know the elf is made of plastic/whatever and wouldn't come close to thinking it's alive. The same way when she sees toys in the shops she doesn't think "are they alive?". No she knows they're plastic. Your story is bullshit. 
$C: Yeah, that may be the case. I think I was in the first or second grade when I found out. But when I found out, I immediately told my younger brother who is two years younger and he seemed less bothered by it than I was. 

I dunno man. I'm still not sure what I'll do when it comes to my own kids. If they are anything like me, they won't appreciate being lied to, even for something this small. Maybe I'll tell them Santa isn't real but it's fun to pretend anyway. Kinda like playing a game or reading a book or watching a movie. We know it isn't real, but we're still emotionally invested and have fun.

We're not talking bruises and scrapes. We're talking significant trauma, such as broken bones and cancer. Those don't "just heal up." They require medical treatment in order to heal properly. Certainly, a cut on my arm will heal; if it's big enough, though, it will leave a scar.

Yes they are. You should look at the difference between containers and streams.
$C: It has to be a bit. Nobody seriously believes that teaching your kid to be kind is the first step to creating a serial killer. 
$C: Well im sorry my dear but your husband's terminal, what terminal? I dont know, i dont even know when the plane arrives. Don't take my word for it though you should probably ask a doctor, I just clean the floors, why do i clean the floors? Cause I can't reach the ceiling.
$C: Aunt May is bullshitting. It is later revealed that it was actually just almond flavoring and sleeping pills - neither arsenic nor cyanide. She just wanted him to think he was dying.
$C: I should at least watch the first one, if only for the sake of having watched it.
$C: Oh.

Oh *Hell* No!

I have not yet begun to *Nerd!*

You just watch me go! You'll see! You'll *all* see!

;)
$C: Hey... I could've recited Vogon poetry, so consider yourself lucky.

You just watch yourself...
$C: Belgium isn't a real country -- it's a candy factory. 
$C: Monitor that orifice, nerf herder!

;)

(What, "sithspawn" wasn't enough for you, ~~Greedo~~ greedy?)
$C: Excellent!
$C: And then her accent is gone by episode 3
$C: Sorry!
$C: Its alright, I'm a nut some times.Fancy myself a cashew, though. The fancy nut.
$C: Hotel?
$C: I hate it too. ;)
$C: Bone fractures absolutely heal on their own.
$C: You're very closed minded. That said, it really doesn't matter or affect anything if you believe me or not, so have a good day.

Editing to add that it's not such a bad thing to disbelieve things that random people on the internet say haha. It's just that in this case when I happen to not be lying (not that I can prove that), and believing or not believing my story has absolutely no effect on anything, it's not very nice to go to so much effort to make sure I know you don't believe me when it's a story that does make me sad.
$C: Lol you get upset at imaginary “hipsters” (which I’m not, my parents just didn’t really care about Santa so I don’t ) “unconforming” when all you’re doing is being upset that people have different opinions than you on what lying means. Grow up you little crybaby, of course your response is a troll insult.

I said multiple times I don’t care if people teach their kids about Santa, so you can’t even read properly. It was about what lying is, which means telling something that isn’t true. Santa doesn’t exist, telling your kids he does is lying. Whether the lie is worth it or not is up to an individual family
$C: That's it. I'm fucking the prostitute while she feeds me pizza.
$C: I don't see the point of the service if she doesn't have any pizza.
$C: Good rule of thumb: if she sticks it up the bum, she gets none.
$C: Sounds legit.
$C: You guys are retarded.
$C: okay, then aunt may isn't very educated about poisons, which is kind of nice... :)   thx
$C: I like the second one better. 
$C:  ♫  Take my karma, take my quotes, Take me where I cannot post. I don't care, I'm still free, You can't take the nerd from me... ♫
$C: ...d-do you have the death sentence in twelve systems?!
$C: Somehow I totally glossed over sithspawn. Was looking too hard for kriff or kark. 
$C: "I couldn't go around talkin' like a frickin leprechaun, could I?"
$C: Yeah, they're spies. They use all sorts of accents throughout the show. When Pheona and Michael first met in Ireland she thought he was an Irishman named Michael McBride. He had to live with that accent for who knows how long. So when she came to America she just adopted an American accent to fit in.
$C: Lol, apology accepted. I'm sorry for lashing out as well.
$C: Yes please?
$C: > Bone fractures absolutely heal on their own.

Well, yes, the heal on their own, but if you don't treat them properly, you could be crippled for life for that limb. Treatment is most often a cast, but that's still treatment, without which, your bone could "heal" in such a way as to be detrimental to future use.
$C: [removed]
$C: And you've got a big ugly face that's as dumb as a butt. What's your point? 
$C: "*Miranda*..."
$C: And that's just for stealing hotel towels!

;)
$C: I always figured that for the pilot they decided she'd be Irish but then just decided it was too hard. 
$C: Dunno why, but I feel I have to tell you that my comment, though hyperbolic, was genuine! I was trying to agree with you that leaving a bible verse as a tip is just not on. Happy new year :)
$C: Sexe time?
$C: Yeah it could, or it could not. A doctor might say in that case that "probably your bone won't heal correctly" but when it does you wouldn't say that meditation is why it healed correctly and make up pseudoscience bullshit.
$C: First, "high and mighty", never claimed anything of the sort. What a weird thing to make up.

Second, I never claimed lying is inherently bad, just that its taught that telling the truth (you know the thing you teach a four year old when he lies about drawing on the wall but actually did draw on the wall?) is usually the good thing to do. You seem to have some weird belief that lie somehow equals told something to hurt somebody. It literally just means saying something that is factually incorrect.

Third, more ad hominem insults calling me fake when that doesn't even make sense. How am I fake? There are a dozen insults you could've used there but fake was a weird one. I'm not trying to impress anyone, especially not some loser who thinks everyone who disagrees with him is a hipster. 

Fourth, if I am not something, why would I not deny it? Never had a tofu burger and tofu is gross, I wear contacts, I'm not 14 so I dont use instagram, and I am not sure what hemp cloth is but I buy shirts from my department store for like eight dollars. I don't meet any of your criteria for a Hipster. 
$C: **YOU MthrF_er!!!**
$C: No, it ties into the story several times. I've watched the whole series. Most of it is pretty good. 
$C: That makes things a whole lot clearer. I was just confused haha, sorry. Happy new year to you as well!
$C: > ...pseudoscience bullshit.

Ever heard of the placebo effect? What do you make of that? Obviously, it's not pseudoscience, but it's also outside our current understanding. But it has a lot to do with the brain's thoughts affecting the body.

$C: [deleted]
$C: 100% reason to remember the name...

;)
$C: I saw the first few seasons. I still think it was retconned. 
$C: There is a big difference between the placebo effect and someone controlling their bones with their mind.
$C: Then don't come on to Reddit and don't respond to posts. It should take you twenty seconds to read that.
$C: > There is a big difference between the placebo effect and someone controlling their bones with their mind.

Not really. Or not much. It's a conscious vs. subconscious thing, right? But, in both cases, it's the brain doing the work, not the medicine.

If I tell you, "This pill heals cancer," and it's a placebo, and your cancer goes away, the mind/body did it.

If I tell you to concentrate real hard to heal your cancer, it probably won't work. HOWEVER, that's because we don't yet understand the mechanism in the mind that can affect the body like the placebo effect.

Once we no longer need the pill, and we can get the brain/body to do it, then we'll be able to control our bones with our mind.

BTW, I'm not saying this "control" is super-natural or otherwise outside normal science. I'm saying, there's a mechanism in our brain, in our physiology, that allows for significant control of bodily functions with the brain. We just haven't figured it out yet.

$C: Ah so youre fourteen and also illiterate. Got it. Go insult people elsewhere thanks.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I'm on mobile, you can go fuck yourself with the apostrophes. That has nothing to do with illiteracy.

If you decide to be a dick to someone and insult them, and they respond, then read the response or dont reply you fucking child. I'm done arguing with the worst troll in the history of Reddit.
