I get an email every time I get a package delivered to my apartment‚Äôs mailroom. It‚Äôs supposed to be a photo of the label, but there‚Äôs this one guy...

$C: I already love him
$C: If you get enough, you should make him a little calender of himself for the holidays
$C: Hi neighbor. I love this delivery guy too. 

Edit: on a plane. Shall deliver later. 

Edit2: not really sure how to post pics....

Looking good! http://imgur.com/P9I0sra

$C: [removed]
$C: Be honest, you prefer these pictures. 
$C: I think I‚Äôd look forward to the pics of this guy just as much, if not more, than the package!
$C: Ah Man I'd be ordering parcels all the time.
$C: UPS? How do you set that up? I would love to get a photo of my packaged. UPS drivers normally toss them in the ftont porch, don't even ring the bell 
$C: *insert ‚Äúfull package‚Äù joke here
$C: Please. More. 
$C: I always make weird or stupid faces when I'm driving and pass through a photo toll booth. My hubby thinks I'm crazy, but I'd like to think that there's a person somewhere who will appreciate a break from the resting bitch faces of most drivers.
$C: He fine as hell
$C: That is awesome. What a dude! Order more packages and post more pictures! 
$C: He looks like he's extremely rough with those packages...With those big, strong arms...I might need some insurance. 
$C: Oh, man, a calendar would be AWESOME.  I'd be ordering random shit and breaking it into multiple orders just to get enough pictures for a whole year.
$C: This guy deserves a raise
$C: Is your mail guy Biff Tannen?
$C: I want to be friends with this man!
$C: r/forearmporn
$C: Ducking legend. He‚Äôs one of those dudes that makes going to work fun 
$C: That's one beefy mofo. Maybe he's sending you a message? 
$C: [deleted]
$C: i would not mind receiving pictures from this guy.
$C: This guy should have his own subreddit 
$C: See, this is the kind of thing that makes me like a company: employees feeling secure in their jobs enough to goof a little. Sadly, all too often companies have the opposite, and arguably wrong, response to this kind of thing. FYI, UPS, this guy makes me love you a little more.
$C: Late to this party but here are some of my pictures of him! [https://imgur.com/a/wCGVwkm](https://imgur.com/a/wCGVwkm)
$C: Oh sweet baby Jesus üòçüòçüòç 
$C: Lol. That's great.
$C: I want him to deliver a package to me!
$C: I wish they would do that for me. Instead, we ordered a sausage stuffer- a 70 pound package- and they put it on the fucking hood of my truck. Nevermind there was a trailer with steel on it on the other side of the driveway, somehow the hood of my truck was the better option.
$C: I love him 
$C: It seems this man is trying to get started as a mail model. 
$C: It was the Friday before a long weekend here yesterday.  I was out running errands and everyone was in such a rush and acting like such assholes.  Driving like maniacs in the parking lot, not saying thanks when I'd hold a door open, yelling at each other in stores.  It had been a rough week already,  I got home and felt completely  drained.  I saw this post of a guy who just takes some time through his day to try to make people laugh and I actually cried a little.  I know that sounds lame as hell, but people can be so discouraging at times and little things can make such a huge difference in someone's day.
$C: Man's fit though, gotta give him that
$C: [deleted]
$C: I worked many years in UPS corporate management. I can promise you none of us would ever have a problem with this. It's a good laugh.

What he will get dinged for is the earpiece.  Unless it has changed very recently.

UPS is extreme in process, down to the way you put your seatbelt on, where everything is kept, what turns to make, etc.

The calculations are like this. Imagine if we deliver 16 million packages on an average day (because we do) and we can save 3  seconds per package by changing the way you you put the box on the porch.

This saves 13,333 work HOURS per DAY. That's a LOT of money, no doubt.

Not to mention, driving with headphones in both ears is illegal in almost every state I believe
$C: *hero 
$C: What an absolute unit
$C: Don‚Äôt get this guy fired too lol. Remember what happened to the security guy?
$C: It's all fun and games until someone pulls their penis out.
$C: I love this! Hopefully someone told him that they like those goofy pictures so he‚Äôs doing it all the time. 
$C: Don't get the guy fired by posting this. His boss probably won't be laughing about it. 
$C: This UPS man knows how to deliver.
$C: Fuckin' Tackleberry. 
$C: That's UPS's famed customer service for you. 
$C: He reminds me a little of Jayne from Firefly
$C: He‚Äôs cute too. I wish I was OP
$C: He's a keeper.
$C: **His instagram https://www.instagram.com/cholloway686**
$C: Aww he likes you
$C: Love that Reddit reminds me I‚Äôm not the only weirdo in this world 
$C: This is the last thing you see before death.
$C: I wish any of the delivery people in my town did this. It would make getting a package so much more exciting.
$C: Can I marry
$C: Am I the only one thinking of him doing a Jim Carrey "aaallllllll righty then....your package is here" impression?
$C: This guy knows what it's about 
$C: Gotta keep it fun. Work is boring

$C: I want to love my job this much, he looks like he's having the time of his life!
$C: This is the best!
$C: [deleted]
$C: THE PACKAGE HAS BEEN DELIVERED
$C: Bruh is swole
$C: Well whoever married him (judging by the ring on his left hand) really got the full package
$C: You should put up an Amazon Gift List like one of those cam girls. People here will send you shit just to see the pics of him. 
$C: Probably going to get buried but, I have a great habit of making stupid faces on camera.

So the company I work for let's me take 3 breaks a day and I take them in the same spot every day. Every time I go there I pass a camera that the security team for our office monitors. Everytime i see it, i just stare at it and make the most ridiculous face that i can. I try to not repeat them and get craftier everytime. I've gone as far as playing peekaboo with said camera. 

I am still waiting for the day the look at my with disgust or ask me wtf I'm doing.


That is all.
$C: This guy is inspiring.  I'll be motivated for 3 days from this
$C: As a UPS Supervisor, this makes me happy!  Drivers should have more fun while being out there. 
$C: This guy delivers.
$C: At the gym...'hey bro, can you spot me"? 

"FACE"
$C: Let's make this guy internet famous

Edit:.. Aaaannnnnd he's famous
$C: I like people who love and enjoy their jobs like this.
$C: My delivery guys idea of a joke is marking packages delivered but putting them in the wrong mailbox
$C: Love how he rolls his sleeves up like a soldier. This is not his calling and social media has poisoned his mind.
$C: the maddest of lads!
$C: That top one can be used as proof of how they crushed your package.
$C: If you can't have fun with your job. It's not a job. 
$C: I would die laughing if I received pictures like this!
$C: What the hell is locker revolution?

And is that Harry Connick Jr.?
$C: That is awesome!!!
$C: Thats my tinder pic sorted
$C: This guy is awesome!
$C: This mans needs a promotion
$C: Pretty ballsy that you didn‚Äôt block out your name or address 
$C: Needs more pockets i think...those are full.
$C: He is certified to handle all kinds of packages :D
$C: Where do you live? I need to make sure I move there really soon.
$C: A man who loves his package 
$C: This thread delivers
$C: This man needs a raise. 
$C: Why isn't my post guy hot???
$C: Those arms... I hope he isn‚Äôt skipping leg day.
$C: "Mailman doofy reporting for duty"

$C: $100 says this dude ends up on Ellen in like 3 weeks 
$C: Aaaand he's fired. 
$C: Its Ace Ventura Pet Detective trying to get your dog.
$C: LOL I love people with a sense of humor like that. I would do the same. I've tried making faces in driver license pictures and passport pictures but they always make me retake it. The only ones that didn't care were Costco and Sam's Club. 
$C: Did you order tickets for the gun show?
$C: Cringe
$C: My husband is a letter carrier and he does this whenever he sees doorbell cameras.  He says he does it because it makes him laugh but I think he's secretly hoping to find himself on Reddit someday.
$C: We need more people who enjoy their work, like that guy.
$C: Oh man that guy should get a huge tip for Christmas
$C: This is the best thing on reddit today 
$C: Hope he's on reddit so he knows how much love he's getting 
$C: Im a dude and my ovaries quiver for him. The world needs more people who find fun in everyday things!
$C: Mistakenly searched for Buff Delivery Guy with packages  . . . . not this guy
$C: I would have everything delivered. Exclusive online shopping, just for the pictures. 
$C: Wow he's hot lol
$C: That‚Äôs my fraternity bro that‚Äôs fucking crazy!
$C: 10/10 would sign for his package
$C: Honestly, this guy is a goddamn champ. He looks like he actually LOVES his job.
$C: Op whats the adress, we want to send you shit to get more photos. 
$C: Damn brah, this mans arms are fuckin stacked.
$C: My UPS guy does not look like this...:( 
$C: What I would do for one of those guys to deliver my packages...
$C: **FLAWLESS VICTORY**
$C: Hey I‚Äôm reddit famous now!!
$C: TIL women are way more thirstier than men 

If this was switched round we‚Äôd get the ‚Äòtypical Reddit perv‚Äô comments. 
$C: Ok Reddit. Find this man! Wholesome.  Funny. Happy. Lets make him into a star. Much better than another Kardashian....oh he isnt is he?
$C: Chin UPS, pull UPS, sit UPS


Guys fuckin jacked, is what I'm saying.  Bet those shorts are delicious.
$C: You have an entire room dedicated to post??
$C: When you get John Basedow‚Äôs Fitness Made Simple videos delivered
$C: My man at UPS doing it right! 
$C: I believe the term you're looking for is "crushin it"
$C: This is amazing!
$C: Is he delivering the packages or eating them?
$C: What a man <3
$C: You don‚Äôt deserve him.
$C: This looks like the bloopers from some sort of mail delivery porno. 
$C: Funny my UPS guy is on coke.  He‚Äôs tried to sell me some.  
$C: 20 years ago Jim Carrey could've made a successful movie based on these pics alone.
$C: I would buy a calendar of this guy.  There‚Äôs so much win in this post. Op doesn‚Äôt know how lucky he is. 
$C: Cherish that UPS driver.  Not all of them are this cool.
$C: We at ups do shit like this all the time 
$C: Plot twist: OP is guy in the pic when he delivers his own package 
$C: You need to start mailing yourself oddly shaped packages, like a dildo tightly wrapped in paper, just to see his reaction 
$C: "Roger has been forced to resign and no longer works for UPS delivery"
$C: Daddy
$C: I'll offer to help this guy with his package
$C: Find a job that you love guys. Live a healthy life. 
$C: That's a good looking dude.

no homo

^maybealittlebithomo
$C: Cheating bastard probably does this for all your neighbors too
$C: This reminds me of the beginning of Ace Ventura pet detective for some reason..
$C: That man is a national hero
$C: 8/10 would hit that
$C: That guy is awesome. You should honestly contact the delivery company and leave some positive feedback. He deserves it and it's always good to receive that praise at your place of work.
$C: Lol that's funny AF
$C: That something I'd do just to scare people
$C: Reddit we must find this fine human being!
$C: Need an AMA from the delivery guy.
$C: My previous employer required a photo check in to work. I never consented to this, so I would pull up a picture of a celebrity on my phone and point it at the camera.  Someone way up in the corporate office went through all.  It was about a month before there were lots of new rule made about the clock in photographs.  My supervisor made it clear that these pictures are reviewed by people, not computers. Oh, OK.
$C: I wonder if this guy knows that he‚Äôs now famous on Reddit.. someone must know him surely..?!
$C: Your delivery guy gives you funny photos, my delivery guy try‚Äôs to throw my package through an open second floor window...
$C: I love it!! Dude is living his best life!!
$C: Hope you didn't just get dude fired.
$C: We'll great... now he's fired
$C: Now that's someone who has fun with their job.
$C: This might be the most karma I‚Äôve ever seen on a single post. Well deserved. It‚Äôs hilarious!!
$C: Looks like the start of a porno. "I'm here to deliver you a package"
$C: Coolest ups guy. 
$C: I think I‚Äôm in love. 
$C: This guy needs his own subreddit.

R/awesomedeliveryguys
$C: It does not matter your gender or orientation.  You must take him out on a date
$C: What‚Äôs your address? If we send you more packages will you post more pics? üòç
$C: I hope he uses reddit so he can wake up in the morning and see his face on the front page.
$C: very Jim carrey-esque.  Dude's prob funny as shit.
$C: I think this delivery guy needs to do an AMA.
$C: ALSO HE'S JUST AN ABSOLUTE UNIT LIKE DAMN SON DO YOU HAVE A LICENSE TO OPEN CARRY THOSE GUNS LIKE THAT???
$C: You're going to get this man laid or fired. 

$C: I wanna marry him
$C: Hahaha. Cute and funny. Nice. 
$C: Is he single? Asking for a friend.
$C: Imagine being a woman and see this...
$C: THIS IS UPS, I HAVE A F***ING PACKAGE FOR YOU!
NOW SIGN IN RHE DOTTED LINE!
Think of Mr Torgue from borderlands.
$C: I wonder if he does this for everyone, or if you're just special.
$C: How do so many people in the comments know this one delivery driver? Holy shit
$C: You owe that man a guys night out
$C: r/suddenlygay
$C: This made me laugh so much it's my desktop background now. But not OP's picture OP's neighbor got the real money shot.
$C: Definitely Ace Ventura
$C: Why doesn't everyone do this?
$C: I really want the calendar idea to happen.  For charity.
$C: OMG!!! We need more of these people!!!  I'm dying!!! 
$C: When I deliver to a house and they have a dog barking at the glass on the side of the door, I will try to get a picture of the dog through the window with the package. 
$C: Hahahaa best thing Ive seen today
$C: I‚Äôd certainly take his package. 
$C: I'll give this guy 2 weeks before he's either fired, or on Ellen.
$C: can you ask him if he has a boyfriend? 
$C: Why does this guy look like a villain anime character...
$C: Do we want to get another guy fired? Cause this is how we get guys fired!
$C: There is no way he is NOT listening to metal.
$C: I'd feel safer with him guarding my package. 
$C: Jim Carrey has been working out
$C: Give this man an award! Best delivery guy ever!
$C: The hero you need, not the one you deserve.
$C: This is probably the start of some porno. 
$C: hawt
$C: An effective way of flirting with attractive tenants.
$C: With those guns he's a UPS guy by day, Superhero at night!
$C: I‚Äôll accept whatever this guy is delivering. 
$C: Not all heros wear capes. Most wear brown shorts.
$C: Please don't get him fired
$C: Now he's getting fired.
$C: Are you saying that Biff Tannen makes your delivery and sends you those pictures?
$C: This guy is awesome. I get a stoic faced delivery guy who doesn't blink. Can we switch? 
$C: I‚Äôm in love
$C: I love him
$C: I think he's just trying to show you how long and wide his package is. 
$C: He has very nice forearms. 

Let‚Äôs trade mail guys. 
$C: Ah this guys my hero
$C: I'd let him handle my package.
$C: He looks like a JoJo character. 

*OMAE WOH STANDOAH,* **U P S!!!**
$C: God bless this man
$C: He looks like johnny lee miller on the first one 
$C: Why is he like this? I love it
$C: I think this is his subtle way of asking for a date. Good luck, and let us know how it went!
$C: This guy knows how to have fun with his job
$C: This is the kind of mail carrier you want to offer a cold drink to on hot days, or a hot coffee in winter.

I bet he pets doggos so good too.
$C: Damn, wedding ring.
$C: Lock. That.  Down.  
$C: This guy delivers.
$C: Marry him
$C: he cuteüòç
$C: 1. Order something

And over...and over...and over....and....
$C: Aaaaaalllllllllrighty then.  You either get the reference or you don't lol
$C: He‚Äôs jacked 
$C: Oh Hellewwwww. He can deliver my package anytime <3
$C: Notify the advertising agency ASAP. 
$C: Oh baby! Hold on. Be right back, going to order something off line 
$C: I would love to see an album of these. May need its own r/
$C: Awwwww sheeeit. He‚Äôs married üò≠
$C: The hero we deserve 
$C: This guy. He's the BEST
$C: Someone give this guy his own Netflix show! 
$C: CAAAABBBLEE GUUUYYY
$C: I love him.
$C: Alrighty then!
$C: Reminds me of Ace Ventura. "This one's going downtown baby!"
$C: I really appreciate people whose jobs aren't the most fun that still find ways to make them a little more fun. the guy delivering most of my packages is the same. he doesn't make funny faces though instead he yells out polish insults at cars passing by while I sign for my stuff(I'm not polish but I assume they are polish, it's funny nonetheless)
$C: Don‚Äôt lie, these are pictures of yourself!
$C: Is your name in reference to that guy from the Supersonics?
$C: The sunglass placement lol
$C: Any pics of him with a serious face? Like... scowling sulkily? Asking for a friend... 
$C: This is Awesome
$C: I thoroughly enjoy this man.
$C: I would like him to deliver a package to me!
$C: ‚ÄúBend, and snap!‚Äù
$C: I really, really hope this hasn't gotten this dude fired.
$C: Careful now, that's how 4chan gets people fired. 
$C: Well, there goes his job.
$C: How do I get that specific delivery man to deliver something to me? Asking for a friend 
$C: Your username is amazing.
$C: "Sounds broken."

"More than likely!"
$C: Looks like young Biff from Back to The Future. 
$C: Top pic looks like a swole Rami Malek
$C: If he was ugly, there would already be police at this dudes house. 
$C: He works out
$C: I wonder if he does this to all of the mailboxes or just yours. Reddit?
$C: I'd let him deliver me his package. 
$C: well, someone was in the marines 
$C: We‚Äôd be great friends based on the sense of humor I see in these photos lol
$C: Half the time, makes bro friends.  Other half of the time, playing the long game on 500 chickabee's.  Genius.
$C: When in doubt, use the bend and snap...it works every time.
$C: This guy is awesome.
$C: This guy‚Äôs making the most out of his job. I like him.
$C: Maybe this guy could teach my guy a thing or 2 about not launching my packages at my front door, in the rain, from his truck, at 8pm on a Saturday. 
$C: This is hilarious! There's a man who enjoys his job!

$C: Awesome, someone taking pride in their job and having fun while doing it.  I'd consider myself lucky to have this guy handling my route.  
$C: Guy looks like he‚Äôs related to Biff Tannen. 
$C: Now that's a guy who probably enjoys his job more than most people 
$C: That's some service right there.
$C: 2 days later: Reddit gets package delivery man fired
$C: AAAAnd fired

congrats OP
$C: Is there an 'I love my job' subreddit?
$C: Johnny Bravo is your mail guy? He's dyed his hair.
$C: Oh no!! Don‚Äôt get him fired like fart guy! üòï
$C: Damn, I can look that good if I start working at the UPS?
$C: Hey, thinly veiled commentary on how inadequate every male reader of this post is compared to the expectations of the average lady! Something that, with gender reversed, would be completely offensive and unacceptable.

Nice! Fuck white dudes who don't look as good as this guy or dare to attempt more than delivering packages though, amirite?!?!
$C: The top pic looks almost like a gta loading screen
$C: The guy was probably like: Gotta post for instagram real quick...
$C: I make it my mission to never let my face show in those photos.  
Anytime my face is in one, I have the most ridiculous face.  
Maybe I should embrace it, like this guy..  
Then again I doubt I have his crazy confidence. 
$C: And now he'll probably get fired cuz you know... Internet. 
$C: r/forearmporn
$C: Why is Jonny Bravo delivering your mail?
$C: I feel like he's  channelling  his inner Jim carrey/cable guy
$C: Somebody zoom in and enhance. Let's get OP's address.
$C: Reminds me of Johnny Bravo.
$C: Now i can never look at my UPS person the same again, just looks of disappointment. 
$C: Sorry ladies... zoom in on left hand bottom picture.
$C: The package whisperer 
$C: What is the most upvoted reddit post of all time
$C: I feel like he is the embodiment of every UPS guy I have ever seen
$C: Is he a star yet?
$C: That is hilarious. And id prefer this to a boring label anyway..
$C: This is how it starts until he begins to send you notifications of HIS package.
$C: Way better than the dick pics they send me at my apartment mail room.
$C: Holy fuck what are these updoots
$C: OP, is your username a spin on Detlef Schrempf?
$C: That is a man that really loves his job
$C: These are infinitely better than anything else
$C: Adopt him 
$C: #**BOTTOM TEXT**
$C: Legendary
$C: 109k... holy cow
$C: What a fucking legend! :D
$C: At least you can now place a face to the person molesting your packages.#success
$C: When did the shamwow guy start doing roids?
$C: Biff got a new job! Better keep an eye on him...
$C: Is OP really detlef schrempfs alter ego?
$C: Ace Ventura in real life
$C: this guy should get a promotion
$C: This guy delivers.
$C: That guy is getting fired: https://tenor.com/tBLz.gif
$C: It‚Äôs amazing how you can tell so much about a persons personality by a picture. I already know he‚Äôs a nice fun guy 
$C: Reminds me of Jensen Ackles as Dean Winchester... the episode where he's got a curse on him and he screams real high pitched over a cat. 
$C: HEY MCFLY!
$C: This is the opposite of a problem 
$C: Anybody else get a UPS ad with this page? Not sure if that‚Äôs genius marketing or tracking numbers have me a cookie.
$C: Glad to see Mickey from Shameless got a new role. 
$C: He didn‚Äôt get the memo. Make sure he doesn‚Äôt get the memo. Omg üòÇ
$C: #RidiculouslygoodlookingUPSGuy
$C: I love my Amazon delivery man, he knows me  by name but asks with interest what it is I ordered. He once saw that i ordered a 24k collagen masque from China.
$C: If you don't fuck him, I will
$C: He gives you the same face every time. 

&#x200B;

hahaha.....

&#x200B;

people that enjoy their job are the best. 
$C: I love fun customer service!
$C: Lools like bro is on to your bong and pound of weed. 
$C: He looks like Johnny Lee Miller:

Imagine that... looking like a movie star even when you pull silly faces.
$C: UPS driver here. Would be real cool if I was as attractive as OP‚Äôs driver. 

:(
$C: Awwww I want him as my UPS guy too :( I need people like this in my life!
$C: Oh my god! 128k updoots. This is by the highest I l've personally seen since starting on Reddit.
$C: Bet you anything he's on Ellen in the next 2 weeks. Definitely on the chive by Tuesday. 
$C: i would ask for things mailed just to see those arms.
$C: The face you make when your uncle comes up from behind you. 
$C: He looks fun and attractive. 
$C: I would be buying things all the time just for the photos...
$C: They promise your items of questionable nature will be shipped in discreet packaging... But, the delivery guy knows!
$C: He can do whatever he wants to me
$C: AMA request: Colby Holloway
$C: [HE KNOWS](https://i.imgur.com/wEF5zXT.jpg)
$C: I would be ordering multiple packages a day
$C: How does he take those pics?
$C: He's going to get fired for mishandling packages which have specific handling instructions.
$C: I needed to smile. Thank you...both.  
$C: Anddd he just lost his job... good work...
$C: Ridiculously Photogenic Package Delivery Guy
$C: This is the best thing ever
$C: Super hot and funny! Mmmmmm!!!!üëçüòÜ
$C: Well hello there Mr. UPS Man

$C: Can he just crawl into my mail box? 
$C: Its true, I was the package
$C: I had an absolute shit day and he has made me so unbelievably happy.
$C: Pic 1: "New sex doll, huh?"

Pic 2: "Edible toilet rolls? WTF."
$C: Everything is generally shit.

This guy is not shit , Well done to this guy.

True story.
$C: Who's a babe....
$C: United Postmen of Swole
$C: Nine nine! 
$C: As a fellow driver, I am so proud!!! 
$C: See if he‚Äôll do some noods for a calendar
$C: I'm always tempted to do stuff like this when I'm delivering to the lockers at apartments, but I just hold the label up in front of the screen like a loser. This guy speaks for us all!

UPS driver in WA
$C: reminds me of Jim Carrey 
$C: Delivering packages and recieving gains.
$C: Marry him.
$C: This is great. What a way to live. I love it. If I could, I‚Äôd capture his charisma & joy and bottle it up for myself. 

The Charisma & Joy I speak of does not come in form of body fluids. 

Just saying. 


$C: This is great, give that man a raise
$C: I wouldn't complain about these pics xD
$C: I chew bubblegum and deliver hot memes, and Im all out of bubblegum...
$C: He loves his job. Also, I love him and I want to marry him 
$C: hehe, what a legend
$C: Give this man a pay rise! 
$C: I love this! 
$C: Marry him
$C: I'd accept his package.
$C: Great humor and guy works out. Nice one üòé
$C: Biff???
$C: He's making the Nu-male Smile
$C: Mishandling Muscle Mike.
$C: This was the best part of my year, thank you
$C: I LOVE THIS GUY!!
$C: This makes me so happy. I love people who can mess around but still do their job.
$C: That's the opposite of our UPS guy.  Ours can't even be bothered to flip open the lid of our package box, much less take an awesome photo of himself.
$C: That‚Äôs awesome! Sucks that some asshole will probably report him and get him fired üòí
$C: He's really hot... is he single? 
$C: Can this please be a thing? Although...at my house the pic would include the dogs going ham at the window.üòÇüòêüôÑ
$C: Where can you sign up to marry him?
$C: This guy is awesome. 
$C: Must be a Marine with those biceps..we need him on our side..shouldn't have any issues with deliveries anyway.
$C: i get a feeling he‚Äôs just like THE CABLE GUY
$C: Well built, good attitude, gain fully employed. His wife is a lucky woman and his instagram is so wholesome 
$C: Im crying, this is so hilarious. LMFAO 
$C: marry him 
$C: This guy enjoys life
$C: It's people like this who are going to improve morale. 
$C: I wouldn't mind getting those pictures 
$C: look at that snuggle muffin protecting your package
$C: No homo but I‚Äôd let him take me out to a nice seafood dinner and never call me again
$C: I married the wrong man.
$C: Wish he‚Äôd deliver his package to my apartment if you know what i mean 
$C: Dude's got some nice forearms. As a small forearm guy, am jelly. 

^^no ^^homo

^^^^but ^^^^^maybe ^^^^^a ^^^^^little
$C: If this guy delivered my packages I would spend every last penny that I have on online ordering and it would be worth it. 
$C: aaaannnndddd I am in love :)
$C: It's not every day a guy sends you a picture of *your* package...
$C: I hope this guy doesn't get fired like the fart documentarian.
$C: Hopefully this guy doesn't fart taking one of these and lose his job...
$C: This dude is ideal. Attractive and can still goof around. 11/10
$C: Is he single !?
$C: He is so damn hot! Bring me a package.
$C: Realtalk, im a straight man, but your delivery guy is hot.
$C: Is he on an FBI watchlist? 
Because those guns he's delivering are absolutely criminal.
$C: Love how he rolls his sleeves up like a soldier. This is not his calling and social media has poisoned his mind.
$C: God I would spend so much buying things I didn't even need online every day just so I could get a delivery. 
$C: I can‚Äôt stop laughing hysterically at this. I wish they did this for my amazon packages. He‚Äôs a hotty too lol
$C: Yum, I know what brown can do for me....
$C: Best thing I've seen in a **looong** time!

&nbsp;

 **UPS: Don't fire this dude, or I swear I'll boycott.**
$C: He‚Äôs hot AF
$C: Marry him. 
$C: The arms, the sense of humor, the uniform.. it‚Äôs all working for him. That is an attractive man.
$C: This guy is awesome and I totally think a calendar needs to be made and shared!
$C: I'm in love 
$C: This guy ~~fucks~~ delivers. 
$C: the first time Amazon asked if I wanted to comment on the photo of my delivered package, I clicked 'Yes', and wrote a critiquing of the composition, framing, and mood of the photo.
$C: big dick energy
$C: I‚Äôd order packages just for his pictures. 
$C: Hes attractive af and married
$C: can I get that on a blanket instead of a calendar? 
$C: I‚Äôd hit it
$C: Sounds broken. 
Most likely sir. 
$C: This guy probably fucked your wife once 
$C: ITT: women making remarks about how good looking this guy is


If it was a girl, you females would be going apeshit that us men are viewing her like eye candy.

Fuck off thots
$C: No one puts a label on this delivery guy.
$C: He looks like a real life version of Groose from Skyward Sword
$C: I bet this guy is a blast to hang out with.
$C: Could he start sending me nudes while he's at it?
$C: Looks like he has a crush on you. Shows his Oh Ah face and all.
$C: i found how to get a hot guy to send me photos; let's see....what can i order!
$C: Tyler?
$C: Secret service male mailmen
$C: I have this same service at my apartment and it‚Äôs always a picture of the guys hand, not even the package lol this is much better 
$C: " your dreams are made by HDS!!!"
$C: Well, that's love, clearly... but did he give you the permission to show the photos, him trying to get your attention?
$C: The day he ever quits or gets fired this is the day you're going to start missing pictures like these
$C: Doug heffernan
$C: This guy is awesome!
This is a way better way to know you have a package
$C: Good to see Jim Breuer still getting work.
$C: Is that grey one a package from wish?
$C: It doesn't matter what you do in life, just enjoy it and give it your all.
$C: If Rick O'connel and Jim Carrey had a baby.. I already love this man. 
$C: This is hilarious.

Hopefully you got his permission, I think it would be kind of fucked up posting someone‚Äôs picture without it
$C: What if he only does it for your locker?
$C: Wife that man! 
$C: That‚Äôs great!  I need to show this to my door guys so they get pumped up for my packages!!
$C: Omg that‚Äôs the best! He must be really bored.
$C: Maybe he‚Äôs hitting on you? Wants you to know how his face looks
$C: This should totally be company policy to do this.
$C: I want one too!!!! 
$C: Hope this guy doesn‚Äôt get fired. 
$C: The last time I saw forearms like that they were in a home run race with Sammy Sosa. 
$C: He wont get in trouble for this right?
$C: Since when is Jim Carrey delivering packages?
$C: Please keep updating with more photos. I'd love to see an album!
$C: UPS Bro!
$C: He rules.
$C: I want to work with this dude. 
$C: Dudes a champ. Deserves a raise....sent email with attachments to UPS
$C: UPS the Best üëä
$C: Absolutely amazing.

He should make it a challenge to see how many pictures he can take doing the same face expression.
$C: You should leave him one of you receiving the package.
$C: Some asshole is gonna get him in trouble for that and it's a shame.
$C: Enjoying his job like a boss
$C: Dude looks jacked. Best to stay out of it.
$C: Alright reddit find him
$C: This remind anyone else of Jim Carrey in Ace Ventura?
$C: Why are some guys in cliche porn occupations so fucking hot. Like, pornstar hot? Really makes you wonder...
$C: The timeless art of seduction 
$C: I want this guy promoted.
$C: This is the UPS guy that delivers a package to your wife at 3pm
$C: And never have you ever before ordered so much online.
$C: That damn smile...
$C: Save it for sunday gunday mate.
$C: Amazonus Prime 
$C: Whenever he comes, it brightens up your day,

$C: karma whore
$C: ... breaker of worlds.

$C: You mean there is this one legend.
$C: I hope he gets a raise
$C: Delivery guys do well with the ladies (and fellas if that's your mojo). I've been one for years and wouldn't want to do anything else.

$C: Technically, the label is in the picture. [](/kmudbriartechnically)
$C: I feel like this "delivery" guy has a wad of very sweaty dollar bills at home.
$C: Almost looks like he's cell shaded in the first pic lol

$C: He looks like RanXerox. Just needs the weird glasses.

$C: Kyle O'Boyle?

$C: You‚Äôve only received two packages? 
$C: Doesn‚Äôt amazon have an option to ship items as they are ready? I‚Äôd be ordering things every day. 
$C: Give him a rise! 
$C: That's fantastic

$C: I would not be surprised if UPS or FedEx hires this guy into the marketing department.
$C: I can't stop laughing at this! I want to run up and down my street and start knocking on doors and showing everyone!
$C: Our Luxer machine apparently takes the photos quickly after you press the option, so the photos of the labels are usually just the delivery guy staring at the screen
$C: Is it a LuxerOne system?
$C: Colby!!!!!
$C: HGH sir and how are you doing, ALRIGHTY THAN! I have a package for you!

$C: Give that man a raise.

[Let us not forget the Champions of yore...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChampionsOfReddit/)
$C: That guy is awesome! 
$C: Amazon logistics takes pictures of packages they drop off. The most I ever got was a stray foot in the pic.
$C: LOCKER! PACKET! REVOLUUUUUTION!
$C: I wanna be that delivery guy.
$C: C‚Äômon man. He‚Äôs just trying to show off his gains.. which are good btw. 
$C: that guy is awesome
$C: I love him 
$C: MARRY HIM
$C: Fuck I wish my mailroom got great photos like that

9/10 are just a black screen for me
$C: Probably Luxer One service?. In my case the lady that delivers usually shows of her nails and the label is out of focus
$C: LMAO
$C: I wish everyone was like this.
$C: r/madlads
$C: this guy is a joker, it makes my day :D
$C: He's hot, delivers that awesome thing you ordered, and makes you smile? He is the prototype \[in my three stacks voice\]
$C: Careful Reddit, we don't want to make this guy the next Paul Flart
$C: damn, i wish we had him in our building. our delivery guys can't even get the package in the photo. this guy is awesome!
$C: Its because he‚Äôs hot 
$C: Postman Pump
$C: That is a lot of shirt pocket cargo.

$C: Best delivery person ever
$C: He's just so... dreamy
$C: Holy shit that dude is jacked.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Way to go UPS Dude!!
$C: That guy is priceless
$C: An ace Ventura 
$C: Its strange what posts get to the all time top of /r/all. There was the guy posing with ass cracks at the Magic tournaments and this post will be up there. 
$C: I can't even!  IDK how I'd feel the 1st one or two pics but I'd grow to adore this guy for sure. lol
$C: It's probably OP in pictures. 
$C: derp
$C: Biff?
$C: Space Marine Scout delivery service
$C: Im not sure what say about this. At least it's a nice surprise.
$C: I love it üòç 
$C: First of all, He‚Äôs a mail guy but he kinda looks like he‚Äôs strong lmao
$C: Q q√†
S
$C: lol, what a weird system, why does he have to take a picture with the package/label?  Shouldn't the email be enough to be like GO GET YOUR PACKAGE.
$C: I think I know this guy - or his brother! Always used to sign my packges and leaave nessages on the wrapper
$C: The world needs more of this. 
$C: Nice
$C: I wonder if he does this only for you, or for everybody in that mailing room. I love this :)
$C: This made my fucking day. I would look forward to the funny pictures he sends more than the actual package. 
$C: Hi, Vince here with Slap Chop.
$C: Ttsxgfr
$C: Wow
$C: r/deepthroat
$C: I‚Äôm trying to pick up my packages but this one guy keeps emailing my ass.
$C: Im not complaining. More photos please!
$C: A simple legend.
$C: Highest upvoted non archived post here. I see you sort by new...
$C: Well, the label should be showing, so he loses points for the first picture, but you gotta love his "snark".  I think UPS needs to give him a raise for making people laugh.
$C: Put him on Ellen pls

$C: That guy rules
$C: So can I send you something in hopes of getting more pics.? 
$C: There are more pics in this post: https://www.instagram.com/p/BnbCbbFAUFp/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1of0o694o8m9h

The guy is just funny. I hope UPS just leaves him doing his job. It's their best representative.
$C: I wish he worked at my center damn üòç
$C: [removed]
$C: The chad delivery man.
$C: yeah but who is taking the pictures?
$C: It‚Äôs the real Ace Ventura. üòÜüòÜüòÜ
$C: You just got him fired.

$C: I get what girls are sayin about how the ups guy is the new mail man (read: guy who sleeps with your wife while you‚Äôre out).
$C: Yes how much for the calendar 
$C: Lol! I wish he was my delivery man!
$C: He could deliver a package to me anytime. 
$C: If he delivered my mail I‚Äôd max out the credit cards 
$C: look fun and sexy so i'm good with that post lol
$C: I love him.  
$C: Please buy something that comes in a dildo shaped package :)
$C: man look at those arms
$C: he's cute tho
$C: Did I just become gay and  a bottom in one fell swoop?  I strangely want to know what brown can do for me.

$C: He cute
$C: This guy is smokin!!!
$C: How can I find and marry him?
$C: Do like I did, fuck the UPS dude. Priority service after that, lol
$C: When you play fuck marry kill, this guy is the answer too all of them.
$C: I'd blow my paychecks on stuff just to get more of these
$C: Maybe if you get lucky he'll eventually leave a picture of his package
$C: Do you take any opportunity to order packages now? Lol
$C: Omg I love him lol!!!!! My kinda dork!
$C: I would literally order packages every day just for this dude to take pictures
$C: He‚Äôs cute.
$C: I'd have an order coming in every day of the week!
$C: Can I borrow your usp guy? The new one out here has marked my package as "failed to deliver" twice now, both days I was home, and both days I got the email 8 hours before he's scheduled to even drive out here. I know for a fact that he's just making my package so he doesn't have to dive way out here to the boonies for just me. 
$C: Yessss
$C: Thats very sweet *nohomo
$C: Hot guy 
$C: 10/10 would fuck
$C: This is where you use the bend and snap. 
$C: Looks like times are tough slaying demons if Dean Winchester is delivering packages
$C: This would make me seriously up my online shopping habits üòÇüòÇüòÇ
$C: Those arms üòç... How can I have him deliver to my place too??
$C: Those arms!
$C: Can he come deliver my packages??!!
$C: AMA request for him.
$C: He is so hot. 
$C: I bet that dude spends hours looking at himself flexing in the mirror. LOL Imagine what he does to your package.
$C: this is wonderful and I would looooove to get these pictures.
$C: That guy is about to get laid by every man, woman, and animal on the computer.
$C: Is he single? Asking for a friend
$C: I want that delivery dude delivered to me please.
$C: He OBVIOUSLY wants a job - what's your general occupation?  News?  Media?  Theater?  Movies? Something he'd be interested in?  

I give him props for originality and my wife says he's cute.  Signing off Reddit now....
$C: Saving these for, er, personal reasons. Move along. 
$C: You need to tip him as much as you can.
$C: *clicking on the comments button*

"Hm I wonder if the top comments will all be about how this guy's attractive."

*page loads*

"Ayyyyyy."
$C: "Let me show you my package" -probably this guy
$C: I‚Äôd constantly order shit just to keep him busy. He looks like a fun guy. 
$C: I'd star in that porno
$C: I would be buying toilet paper online just to see those pics. Dude really knows how to make me laugh

$C: Marry him.
Invite Reddit. 
Get karma.
$C: I‚Äôd marry him üòä
$C: Thirst
$C: I would go bankrupt trying to see him everyday 
$C: Im in love!
$C: Only thing that would make this better is if he delivered in a nice suit or tux.
$C: Is he wearing a ring?
$C: Buff boi. ü§©
$C: Lucky
$C: I‚Äôll take two.
$C: This dude looks like he‚Äôs loving life, and his tight shirts.
$C: I love him.
$C: I love him
$C: Would be awesome if you put a request on the UPS label (can you do that?) to have the UPS driver get a pick but in seasonal fashion, like santa hat, 4th of July hat, etc. And make a calendar out of it, as someone else suggested. 
$C: Wouldn't mind seeing his package lol 
$C: üòÇüòÇif i wasn't such a lesbo,i'd want to sleep with this bundle of awesome!
$C: Day 1
Mailman: Hmm package says its for Lauren... Well lauren im about to give you a taste of your dream whether you want it or not!

Day 2
Mailman: hmm package says for Robert, better just not deliver it.

Here is a pic of a slave working. Fuck! I will upvote that! My dream.



$C: I hope he gets fired. Fucking chad thinks he can just take pictures with people‚Äôs mail like this.
$C: seems like a narcissistic douche. but who am I to argue, reddit?
$C: What a douchey looking dude lol you guys do realize guys that look like this have very small cocks right ?????
$C: Call the police.

&#x200B;
$C: Isn‚Äôt this kind of sexual harassment? This seems unsolicited and if I were you I would contact the building manager but at least he‚Äôs white so he‚Äôs likely just messing around with you in a non-harmful way. Still, trust but verify!
$C: Can we do that..that thing we do?

I want to see this guy on tomorrow's morning news. 
$C: That's a guy that either loves his job or tries to make it fun at least.
$C: So do I

/r/AlreadyGay
$C: And his biceps
$C: That guy should do an AMA. 
$C: If I was sinhle and desperate id ask him to stay for a bit ;)
$C: I am getting flashbacks to Jim Carey in Cable Guy
$C: i was ur thousandth upvote and that‚Äôs also the first time i‚Äôve done that so i would like to thank you 
$C: But the poor delivery man is still waiting for OP to take delivery of a big package... Into OP's closed heart
$C: I‚Äôm a straight dude, but have some sort of weird crush on this guy too. 
$C: Me too
$C: I don't know how it happened but me too
$C: Me tooooo
$C: I came here to say this.
$C: He needs a very own insta for ups delivery photos.
$C: He is the hero we didn't ask for but we all deserve.
$C: All the women do.....
$C: Give this guy a show!
$C: Look at those arms! 
$C: he is pretty awesome.
$C: Now thats awesome
$C: Great comment
$C: Id rather get a pic of him.
$C: I'm so sad we're not married. 
$C: Fuck him I hope he gets fired. I need those label images to get reimbursed. Let's go and unwind on myrtle beach time
$C: And make me one too.
$C: Here is January.  Love this guy.

$C: The best part? They‚Äôd make the calendar and have it delivered to them by this guy. 
$C: how much for the calendar? I'm in!
$C: And please share the calendar with the rest of us.  This is fucking glorious!!
$C: Hang it on the wall for him to see, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd get a kick out of that!
$C: I'm sure he'd love it for a christmas gift!
$C: >I get an email every time I get a package delivered to my apartment‚Äôs mailroom. It‚Äôs supposed to be a photo of the label, but there‚Äôs this one guy...

I'd definitely buy that!
$C: This is a good idea ;)
$C: I actually did this with my coworkers.  I "wallpaper bombed" them when they left their computer unlocked by taking a picture with their built in camera of myself in some kind of goofy pose and then set their wallpaper to that picture.  I got enough to make a calendar and gave it to them for Christmas.  Seriously, every single person on my team got a calendar.
$C: Dude, you could make some ez cash here.
$C: I mean, I wouldn‚Äôt hate having one. My husband on the other hand......
$C: That‚Äôs the kind of shit that‚Äôll end up with you two on Ellen. DO IT. 
$C: I definitely want one, too!!!  
$C: Just here to be notified when the calendar comes out.
$C: >you get enough, you should make him a little calender of himself for the holidays

Post it here
$C: I would totally to towards crowdfunding a calendar.
$C: Or just hang it in the mailroom and wait for him to find it lol.
$C: Please, add me to this list.
$C: How much for the calendar? It's time to start looking for  the 2019's
$C: That's a little gay but a very interesting idea
$C: I have a print shop and can make the calendar, just need 12 photos. :)

I can probably print them for about 10 bucks a pop, but I‚Äôll need to make a minimum of 25. 
$C: *proceeds to order a dozen pencils on amazon*
$C: I‚Äôm in for a calendar!
$C: I‚Äôll take one!
$C: YES. 
$C: I would order 12 random things just to make this happen.
$C: Calendar, yes please.
$C: Me too!
$C: RemindMe! 100 days
$C: I want a calendar too please!
$C: I, too, would like to order this calendar. 
$C: That is such a fantastic idea. Cheap and awesome!
$C: I want one
$C: Following for calendar link
$C: This guy is the stuff that legends are made of!  I would be anticipating the picture as much as the package!!!
$C: I would buy.
$C: Shit, i‚Äôd buy one. 
$C: I‚Äôd like to place an order as well. 
$C: OP should just make one anyway and just photoshop different seasonal backgrounds
$C: I want one, too!
$C: This would be hilarious. I bet if you made a few he‚Äôd give it to his co workers. 
$C: Calendars are so last year

Edit: Calendars are so next year
$C: I‚Äôll take a calendar also!
$C: I don‚Äôt want one, thanks!
$C: I‚Äôll take a calendar as well
$C: It's kind of ridiculous how much I really do want one of these....
$C: Ask your neighbors to forward you pictures, as I‚Äôm sure he does this with their mail too. Then you‚Äôd have enough pictures, and you can give out the calendars to them as gifts too.
$C: Ship one to the UK too please 
$C: Me too! 
$C: At least, he can‚Äôt say his job is boring. üòÜ
$C: That is honestly such a good idea. You must be great at giving gifts.
$C: Can we ask him to oil up for said calendar?
$C: Brilliant!!!
$C: Ask his girlfriend to make a delivery. 
$C: I need this for reasons 
$C: Ok jumping on this wagon, I'd buy it!
$C: Count me in!
$C: You can do it! 
$C: Or you could try and touch him
$C: !RemindMe 1 month
$C: shutterfly does this very easily
$C: I'm in
$C: Okay OP, seriously do this. I'll buy like a dozen and distribute them to my office.
$C: I'm in
$C: And mail it to yourself in a package so he takes a picture with it
$C: Hey I need this calendar too... 
$C: I'd buy it!
$C: I would buy it. 
$C: I‚Äôll also need one. Please make them in card form so I can stack them on a mini easel on my desk. Thanks. 
$C: Can we get a Kickstarter on this?
$C: As a delivery driver for the same company...no tip card or present would ever compare to a calendar of selfies you collected of me being goofy with your delivery. Absolutely brilliant idea. That thing would be hung up proudly at home and shown off. If you made two I‚Äôd hang one at work for everyone to see. 
$C: If I order one, can I request to have him deliver it?
$C: Join a monthly mailing club, have them deliver on the first of every month, use photos of each month as a calandar gift.
$C: I'll take 10.
$C: I find this hilarious I'm in for a calendar!
$C: I‚Äôd pay good money for this 
$C: I'll pay for that
$C: One for everybody!
$C: Shit.  I'LL ship you stuff if you make the calendar. 
$C: I‚Äôll buy it üòÅ
$C: He can use all of the profits from the calendar sales to supplement his missing income
$C: Shit I would order so much stuff just to get 12 photos of him being a dork just to give it to him
$C: Holy shit this is an amazing idea post a link though because I want one
$C: If you legit have 12 pictures and would want a calendar, I'll volunteer my services to photoshop the background to fit the theme of each month!

Haha this is too good!ü§£
$C: I will take one.
$C: We can all get copies and have him deliver them. How about that
$C: *calendar
$C: That is an awesome idea!
$C: Uuuuu6ni
$C: Only 12 months? Needs to be 20. NEXT!
$C: If I know buff UPS delivery men, this is going to be his second most favorite way for you to reciprocate him showing off his package.
$C: I'll buy. No homo
$C: Nude, obviously.
$C: Package delivery....next one needs to be near his crotch. 
$C: Just post 12 pictures, I‚Äôll make one myself. Thanks. 
$C: Wood purchase. 
$C: Do I have to wait til December to get my copy? Cuz I'll forget to request this in Dec.
$C: As a November baby. Make that bottom photo for my month. Thanks 
$C: Give me three.
$C: you could sell them for ahhh hem "Charity"
$C: Holy hell, yes! I would honestly buy one, probably 2, to give away one, assuming he got paid too 
$C: Hey neighbor!! Thanks for adding more pics!
$C: Does he do this to you too??
$C: Dude, that bicep tho.
$C: r/tworedditorsonecup
$C: well looks like we at least have half a calendar between you and OP
$C: Holy shit this ones even better! What a legend, hope this becomes a meme.
$C: A ripped dude that's also goofy. Sign me up. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
$C: Prove you're his neighbor.

Edit: Noice
$C: I was convinced OP was the guy in the photo until I saw this. Well done, neighbor, for the back up!
$C: /r/2redditors1cup
$C: How is this not the top comment!?
$C: If this guy doesn't deliver, we all need to take pictures next to a screenshot of his comment with a funny face and send that to him.

&nbsp;

EDIT: HE DELIVERED! But we should too
$C: Aren't you kind of required to post your pictures of him, too? 
$C: This is fucking hilarious...
$C: Small world hahaha
$C: This guy is amazing!! Haha. Hope he sees the appreciation from all of us!
$C: Annd neighbor delivers
$C: The calendar idea needs to happen. Between the two of you there should be at least 12 pics, right?
$C: When you find somebody on the Internet who lives in the same complex as you.  Not me. But you and OP.  
$C: You better post them!!
$C: I don't know if you order a pistol, but that delivery man brought some guns. 
$C: What up goose
$C: https://imgur.com/gallery/Ii0bLX2
$C: Following 
$C: So cool! 
$C: This one's my favorite. 
$C: To the top with you! 
$C: HAHA this picture is better than both of OPs combined 
$C: r/tworedditorsonecup
$C: "I'm holding your package...and I jizzed in my pants" - I swear this is same face they pull in the Lonely Island guys. 
$C: Damn he brought the gun show
$C: Pretty sure that having this glorious dude as a mailman unlocks some kind of achievement 
$C: Yeah I don‚Äôt think that guy is legit... he‚Äôs like 3 times the size of me but has less body fat. That‚Äôs not really how bodies work
$C: He‚Äôs on instagram 

https://www.instagram.com/cholloway686

I didn‚Äôt find him, it‚Äôs on a post below. 
$C: Hey, I'm a neighbor too! https://i.imgur.com/sbqlNlW
$C: needs way more upvotes. we need more people submitting pictures
$C: This is amazing.
$C: Get together with OP and make a calendar for this guy for Christmas!
$C: You gonna get in on that calendar idea? Seriously, you can get it done al Walgreens, easy-peasy.
$C: the best one yet
$C: You are lovely 
$C: He is literally the best.
$C: So jealous of your neighborhood!
$C: Oh my god that face is priceless, my sides are in orbit
$C: Fucking RIPPED. Too bad I'm finding this post three hours late, because all of the package jokes are taken.
$C: That's guy is amazeballs. I think I love him and I'm married.
$C: I need more pictures, you need to order more things.
$C: Dude this is godly!!

What shall we name him? Jeff? Jeff the Deliverer? 
$C: This is amazing. 
$C: Found February
$C: This is the best one
$C: Holy shit that‚Äôs the best one yet!
$C: /r/itsasmallworld
$C: This dude is jacked.
$C: Delivery drivers should get ratings and reviews just like Uber or other dinosaurs.
$C: Dude that guy is pretty jacked. Bet he has plenty of help handling his package off duty. 
$C: Jizz. In. My pants. 
$C: Small world afterall
$C: Oh, my god that's amazing.

a b s o l u t e u n i t
$C: He is JJJJAAACKED
$C: And an Arsenal fan?! Swoon!
$C: At first I thought this was a joke because I read ‚Äúchollo way‚Äù üòÇ
$C: To the top! Go Reddit, go!!
$C: It's private :c 
$C: and an arsenal fan!!!
$C: All the comments saying ‚Äúhaha greetings from Reddit‚Äù are making me cringe, I think he gets the point guys stop it lmao
$C: Every vote counts
$C: He's gonna be a confused man come morning when he checks his follow notifications.
$C: Shame he‚Äôs a gooner
$C: I am intrigued by how small the world is and disappointed with the lack of goofy delivery selfies on his profile.
$C: Happy cake day üéÇ
$C: His wife and daughter are beautiful pitbulls?
$C: He already hit 1000 followers as I am writing this comment.
$C: Oh thanks. Now we know he's also really lovely!
$C: Oh my gosh... he‚Äôs... beautiful 
$C: Holy shite, an Arsenal fan. I'm in.
$C: Looking at you people getting excited over 'follower number' make me either appreciate more my life or hate it more. Still ain't sure.
$C: Just stalked, so much cute
$C: Happy cake day! And a 15k comment, Wooo Whoooo!
$C: Hi, Colby! Nice to meet you!  
You...are Colby, right?
$C: He‚Äôs like a ripped Andy Samberg. 
$C: Holy fuck and he‚Äôs an arsenal fan?! This guy is my idol now.
$C: Well, he‚Äôs now +1000 followers. Well done. 
$C: When he squats, the world moves 
$C: Just followed. He‚Äôs up to 2218 followers now :D
$C: Now we can all track HIS package
$C: That is such an odd name for a daughter
$C: That is a cute as fuck family!
$C: Aaaaand now it‚Äôs private!
$C: Doesn't look he same from the profile pic?
$C: Hes probably on the phone to ellen atm.
$C: RemindMe! 1 day

I wanna know how many followers he gets literally overnight
$C: Just followed, he's to 1415 followers now. 
$C: Omg, so much beef on his IG....

This guy looks happy and I‚Äôm grinning like an idiot. I wish him all the best. 
$C: Seems like a good sense of humor as well. 
$C: I just requested him 
$C: Daddy
$C: That man is jacked. Holy fuck.
$C: Hug him Reddit!
$C: > beautiful pit bulls

lol
$C: [deleted]
$C: I hope for them
$C: I see a new meme format in the works 
$C: Seriously. Who needs to see the label I know where I live and Amazon lives. 
$C: Duh, you see that dude's arms; he's jacked... and cute ü§§
$C: I would order so many parcels 
$C: Alrighty then!
$C: I also look forward to this guy‚Äôs package. 
$C: I'd probably just order crap from amazon just to see him.
$C: Oooomf, this boy's got the full package for ya. 

Nah... i think I'd rather have him sayin ¬´I got i little something for ya¬ª
$C: I would probably run my bank account dry ordering stuff online so that I can see these everyday. 
$C: That's why op is ordering stuff
$C: I would order packages just to get this guys package 
$C: Or his package ;) 
$C: I'd order stuff just to see him
$C: Come on, reddit, let's launch this guy's modeling career!
$C: Please be Steve delivering today, please be Steve. Damnit it's Frank 
$C: I would order things on a very regular basis then anxiously wait for my delivery photo.
$C: [HE'S NOT SO PERFECT.](https://i.imgur.com/V1B9L4U.jpg)
$C: Odds he ends up losing his job?
$C: Found the Brit
$C: My thought exactly!
$C: Order a dildo. See if he gets the hint 
$C: MM good think amazon prime is a thing 
$C: Who ordered the beefcake? üòçüòç
$C: Calm down girl, he's married.
$C: It‚Äôs a third party package delivery service for apartment complexes 
$C: Amazon does this too. I get a pic of the package at the front door of my house, not apartment.
$C: Try informed delivery by USPS, they have a website and an app.

Might not get a picture of your package, but they send pics of the mail every day and tell you what packages are supposed to be arriving at your door each day.
$C: my apartment building uses LuxerOne for our mail room. A small tablet like device is near the door, you type your code from the email and it takes a pic before unlocking.
$C: We are not supposed to 
$C: I get those for Amazon
$C: That‚Äôs sad. I love my UPS guy. 
$C: My UPS drivers set the packages on the steps to my porch and takes a picture, if it‚Äôs from Amazon. Not sure how it‚Äôs set up. 

It‚Äôs pretty frustrating, I have 1 label on either side of the porch door asking them to place the packages INSIDE the porch door. So I get to spend the day at work praying my boxes don‚Äôt get ripped off from the steps. 
$C: You can get this. It's like $5 a year or something like that. Super cheap. Myups or something like that. You can also give exact directions to the person or hold a package for a day. Or anything. I use it more than I thought I would.
$C: Clearly your UPS guy sucks
$C: RemindMe! 1 day
$C: I have a trail cam on my porch for other reasons, catches our UPS driver delivering.
$C: Amazon delivery took a picture of my delivers package today, first time seeing.

Nothing this epic though
$C: UPS has an app you can actually track the truck your package is on in real time. 

Also,  we are told to knock and not ring door bells. (At least that's how I was trained) 
$C: There‚Äôs a notified delivery option on the UPS website too I believe. You can sign up for it.  
$C: For what it's worth, USPS does this. Pictures of labels and how many packages are on the way.

No cool live shots though
$C: I wouldnt mind if driver doesn't ring the door bell if he took the time to open the porch door and place packages securely inside  Your mobile device will let you know their out there.
$C: Um yes, I'm not 100% because of the faces he's making but it seems very possible he could be hot 
$C: *"insert"*

I think you already made the joke
$C: When you order a normal package but get the complete package 
$C: Dick in the box. 
$C: Absolute Unit
$C: What can swole do for you?
$C: That first box could very well be a large sex toy.
$C: [*I've* got a package...](https://youtu.be/m94kyVxXUj8?t=1h28m23s)
$C: ENHANCE !
$C: [https://imgur.com/a/wCGVwkm](https://imgur.com/a/wCGVwkm)
$C: Please!
$C: PLEASE
$C: ENHANCE !
$C: And now I‚Äôm doing this because there are an abundance of tolls in the San Francisco vicinity and my RBF is harsh. Thanks!
$C: My buddy accidentally ran a red light one St. Patrick's Day because I was puking out the window of his car. When he got the ticket in the mail, it had a picture of his car running the red light with me hanging out the window. He put it on my fridge next time we hung out. 
$C: I also do this. I take a deep satisfaction out of jokes that may or may not ever land. 

My favorite one? My drivers license organ donor section has different options. One is ‚Äúall except‚Äù and you can write in whatever you don‚Äôt want them to have. Mi wrote ‚Äúpenis.‚Äù

The thought of some paramedic or EMT checking the ID from my dead body, seeing that, and hopefully having a chuckle makes me smile every time I pull out my license. 
$C: I sometimes do this to the security cameras at work.  
$C: I would do that at work. Knowing they review the tapes I figured it would make someone laugh. Well, long story short, apparently I'm immature and flicking off a camera has never been funny. 
$C: My job has a clock in thing that takes a picture of you every time you use it and whoever goes through it must hate me because I try to look ridiculous every single time.
$C: I have a bad habit of doing this at security cameras and ATMs.
$C: Whenever I come home drunk, I make a silly face at my doorbell camera. Always gives me a laugh when I look at the snapshot email the next morning. 
$C: I once danced my ass off in front of a store security camera for about ten straight minutes while my girlfriend shopped. I could see myself in the monitor and I was really going to town. Eventually a security guard came out of the back near where we were standing, laughing his ass off. He said the whole crew was in the back dying and thanked me for the show. The moral is, someone always appreciates it, whether you know it or not. Keep up the good work.
$C: I do that at building security cameras, little bits of fun in life. 
$C: Am one of those people. I work in the San Fransisco area for the DOT and we frequently check the photos for verification purposes (to make sure the system is working correctly) and when the computer cites an error. Sometimes we have unusual vehicles drive through and I check those as well (for some reason the computer doesn't like cement trucks). It can be a pretty boring job but I do recall some funny instances. We've had people giving us the bird, scantily clad woman (the cameras have pretty good resolution), nice cars coming through- some old muscle cars, lambos, that one weiner/hotdog car. One time my coworker thought he saw George Clooney but we couldn't be sure. We even tracked the cars plate the next time he stopped but still no luck. I work with about 2 people at a time and we're pretty close. We've got a board filled with some of the funniest pictures we've seen and sometimes laugh about it. Our boss thinks it's hilarious and we get great feedback from the higher ups when they come in. The head of the DOT came in once and he loved it. And yes, we always have a wholesome laugh when we see people like you trying to make our day better because you're right, most aren't smiling and it can be depressing. So keep it up you really are brightening our days! And... I actually made all that all up im unemployed
:(
$C: I too, do this.
$C: I do this at fast food drive throughs...
$C: I do every time I get money out of the atm 
$C: My favorite thing to do!
$C: I do this as well and any other time I know there's a camera.
$C: Eh, I just flip the bird..
$C: I usually give them the finger... Really don't like how often I see random traffic cameras
$C: I always give them the finger, though it doesn't really matter as they don't send your pictures out anymore since the tickets are based off registered owner not driver. 
$C: Right? I mean anyone that can look that good pulling a face.....
$C: Took the words right out of me mouth. And he‚Äôs got a sense of humor tooü§§
$C: As a straight male I second this
$C: He on the Swol Patrol 
$C: I concur, he fine af.
$C: Got me all thirsty while he's looking like a full course meal. 
$C: Fam, I ain't even gay, but you right
$C: I feel like this will be the pixelated caption in a white border when this starts the BuzzFeed / Facebook rounds. All it's missing is a few emojis.
$C: > He fine as hell

$C: Does Reddit have to sexualize every single post of a good looking person?
$C: I really hope all these people calling this dude attractive are chicks...  
$C: Haha! Came to say this. I‚Äôd be ordering so many packages just for these kinds of pics. 
$C: Yes, op can get on wish and buy tons of stuff for cheap and they come at all random times 
$C: I'll need asshole insurance. 
$C: While he takes you on a colon adventure?
$C: Insurance for when  he starts venturing that colon

$C: I just ordered espresso, nail polish and an Alice in Chains cd from amazon...still use Cds cuz im awesome(and old) Im sure they will just chuck it in my backyard.
$C: Singlehandedly keeping UPS in business 
$C: He got a raise out of me.
$C: Good news then, UPS is entering a new 5 year contract this month which will raise wages for, as I understood it, all UPS employees over the next five years. By the end of the contract drivers will be making around $36.25 per hour meanwhile warehouse loader/unloader wages will be at around $15.50 for part time employees.

Source: I work at UPS and am counting the days until I get my first wage increase.
$C: Don‚Äôt worry he‚Äôs getting one next year.
$C: I just hope he doesn‚Äôt get in trouble 
$C: Considering all the raises he‚Äôs given us. 
$C: If anything he'll probably get fired for this :P
$C: Had to scroll a while to get to the Biff joke, I am disappoint

$C: Welp, I certainty found a new sub. Thank you.
$C: Of course that's a thing
$C: Just how good is this guy at ducking? I mean he may be decent at limbo, but I doubt he's like Neo from the Matrix level of ducking.
$C: Meat Message 
$C: I want to steal his forearms in place of my own. 
$C: Looks like a package 
$C: First thing I thought too!
$C: Warning. Assholes are closer than they appear 
$C: Yeah, and someone should make them into screensavers so I can rotate them monthly
$C: r/deadleaf_shrimpsmailman
$C: Or go to his instagram, u/mulyshan linked it.
$C: Make it happen Reddit 
$C: I second this 
$C: r/UPSexy
$C: Thanks for sharing! I loled!
$C: How does this only have 13 points?
$C: You helped reinforce my thought that he‚Äôs insanely gorgeous. 
$C: Amen
$C: I know what‚Äôs going at the top of my Christmas list üòç
$C: Someone posted his instagram. According to that, he‚Äôs married and has kids, we‚Äôre all a little late. 
$C: I‚Äôd let him deliver his package to me....
$C: I'd be this guy's sausage stuffer.
$C: I weigh 170 thank you very much.
$C: I love him. 
$C: Thank you for this.
$C: did u just assume its gender?
$C: r/upsguysgonewild
$C: I am certainly glad to hear this. He brings credit to your company and you guys can show that UPS is more than a cold dead company. 
$C: Way to ruin a good laugh , corporate guy
$C: The amount of stops my route had was huuuuge, becoming a pro with the left hand seatbelt/right hand key shaved like an hour off of my work day.  Gotta stick to that 9.5
$C: A quick Google search said it's legal in more than half of the states. It sure is fun to blurt out shit just because you think it's accurate.. isn't it.
$C: Link or a tl;dr for those of us who are out of the loop?
$C: This is positive PR for the company no matter how you spin it. If they fire this guy the internet will destroy that company.
$C: ??
$C: ???
$C: If he were to get fired I‚Äôm sure he would get his job back a week later due to the union.
$C: farting one?
$C: This guy is so fucking fired it's not funny.

The first rule of any job is "don't end up on the internet in relation to your job for any reason"

edit: downvoters can have fun getting fired from their jobs for being idiots on the internet
$C: what if op pulls his out first ?
$C: Excuse me, that‚Äôs when the fun and games begin. 
$C: And it's all speculation until you stick your dick into it. 
$C: FTFY: It's all fun and games ~~until~~ when someone pulls their penis out. üòú
$C: It's ok there's other delivery companies that dress in brown they will never be able to track this man down. /s
$C: As long as he isn't farting that's okay. 
$C: Are you kidding?  This is excellent marketing for them!
$C: ....never forget. :'(
$C: Oh shit here we go
$C: Nothing weird about it my friend 
$C: Death by snu snu? 
$C: Doesn‚Äôt he like smash the package to bits in the beginning like all the way from the car to the apartment so he can go steal that fluffy white puppy back? This might be a case of dog napping. 
$C: Link ?
$C: Enhance!
$C: Did on purpose to get more packages for delivery man to deliver quality content for us. Took one for the team! 
$C: Glad I wasn't the only one that immediately thought of good ol' Officer Doofy.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Proooooffffff. Show off those forearms. 
$C: Remember the 2 rules of attraction 
$C: Both.
$C: so how much did you score off him? asking for a friend.
$C: Agree! 
$C: His IG link is posted in replies somewhere
$C: Bow chicka bow wow 
$C: Yes. It‚Äôs very hot. 
$C: Fired for what though? He‚Äôs not doing anything wrong..
$C: happy cake day!
$C: Join the line! 
$C: I hope not, he deserves a raise
$C: Dog Dean Afternoon. Great episode
$C: perfect.
$C: you wanna fck him? drain his balls, while those arms hold you tight. you‚Äôre thinking it, im just saying it out loud.
$C: I feel bad for your man
$C: Oof.  Hope he doesn't see that.
$C: [deleted]
$C: For this I hope we're reaching a point where he gets promoted and rewrites the book on customer service for them.

Or... in their case... writes a book on customer service for them.
$C: This was my first thought also. You‚Äôve got to appreciate someone who has fun during their workday.
$C: I‚Äôll bet it was something nice though. 
$C: I'm a man that will unapologetically admit that dude could get it.

But honestly there are far more posts on reddit dedicated to appreciating hot women.

Also a lot more women hating douchebags making comments like yours 
$C: Incel alert! 
$C: Trying too hard
$C: Steroids.. but they say your balls will shrink. 
$C: Looks like he IS UPS to me.
$C: [deleted]
$C: FedEx? WTF!?!?
$C: Package Largemeat!
$C: [deleted]
$C: No shit! Can he deliver to my apartment?
$C: /r/ihadastroke
$C: Pressing A now, sir
$C: That's the whole point of the post
$C: He probably did.  The drivers have to submit a picture now when they deliver it.  Normally its just a picture of the box on your doorstep.
$C: ahhh instagram, the validation tool for fake lifes and images of perfection.
$C: He's most likely already make the maximum amount he can be making and if not won't get a raise because UPS is a union.
$C: You can actually see it if you zoom.
$C: Just need 10 more delivery pics.lol
$C: With the sleeves cut off. 
$C: Doesn‚Äôt this make you not lesbo, or atleast bi?
$C: [removed]
$C: Hahaha I love how when genders get reversed, you end up getting downvoted for it. Sorry about it bro
$C: You mean acting the way men act?
$C: I think you're looking for r/incels 

You'll be safe from UPS Chads there
$C: I don‚Äôt. 
$C: That‚Äôs not a high and tight. It‚Äôs high, but it‚Äôs not tight. 
$C: [removed]
$C: r/youreenvious 
$C: He'd drop you fella
$C: Because making stupid faces is **so** funny. God r/funny is such a shithole
$C: This is gonna blow your mind, but those are headphones.
$C: Reeee
$C: Sounds like you‚Äôre a bitter angry ugly man. 

Guess what though, he ain‚Äôt gonna be fired because this is GOOD PR for UPS and he‚Äôs clearly not violating anything policy wise. 

So go fuck yourself
$C: Why
$C: Nobody gives a shit if you're gay anymore dumbass
$C: U jelly
$C: Eat a dick.
$C: I can smell you through your comment
$C: I dunno dude. He's showing off his package right there in the pic. Looks pretty average sized to me.
$C: Well our most recent record is getting employees fired for doing funny stuff at work so I hope we don't take that path with it again
$C: This is the top post on Reddit right now, I'd be surprised if he wasn't on the phone with Ellen already
$C: You mean get him fired?
$C: You... You‚Äôre asking us to misidentify him as a suspect for something?
$C: Buzzfeed:
‚ÄúYOU WILL NOT BELIEVE WHAT THIS GOOD LOOKING MAILMAN DID!‚Äù
$C: This is the guy:
 
https://www.instagram.com/cholloway686
$C: Don‚Äôt worry, Buzzfeed is already writing the article about *their* awesome delivery guy with pics in a convenient slideshow format. 
$C: OP needs to post his address so we can all send him stuff. 
$C: Jesus Christ, dude. I know this guy's not exactly doing what he's supposed to, but there's no need to murder the guy!
$C: Caaaan weeeee? 
$C: Yeah that's what the *news* needs. Forget the important stuff actually happening in the world. "Up next at 6:00 you'll love this guy who delivers mail and does this retarded face while doing it! We'll cover it for a solid 45 minutes and oh by the way theres some new virus outbreak or something GOODNIGHT!."
$C: Hopefully he won't lose his job like the farting security guard... 
$C: ...SWAT him?

Don't you think that's a little uncalled for?
$C: ....aaaaaannnndddd he's fired. 
$C: And then the day after people are sick of him
$C: > Can we do that..that thing we do?

You mean falsely accuse someone of a heinous crime, like the Boston Marathon bombing?

Okay, sure, what nasty business can we pin on him?  Is it possible we can convince people he murdered both McCain and Aretha with Fentanyl?
$C: Seeing that the news reference Reddit as their source, it would not surprise me. 
$C: That thing reddit does that ends up in the morning news. Hmm, you're gonna have to be more specific..
$C: Let‚Äôs do it! C‚Äômon reddit! 
$C: Top post on the front page right now.
$C: No. You'll see this on BuzzFeed, and like it.
$C: Alright reddit, we‚Äôve got a good story and a picture of the guy. Do your thing now
$C: I actually think it's more so Facebook that gets people on Ellen, and less Reddit. Sometimes my brother forwards me pics or videos on Facebook and I see them on Reddit the next day. Not something people on here want to acknowledge but it happens. 
$C: I will praise whichever one it is 
$C: And then he gets canned or stuck in the same position forever for not being a robot at work. 
$C: you'd love that job and be that happy too if you made that union $40/hour with amazing benefits.
$C: Take pictures of the package, they said.  Challenge accepted says he.
$C: UPSers....they love to hate their jobs, but can't get better pay elsewhere. Work hours are brutal though.
$C: or he's getting laid a lot that way....
$C: Or BOTH - loves his job, because he makes it fun.
$C: I would wife him up in a heartbeat
$C: Oh most definitely those biceps 
$C: I was gonna say that man is jacked
$C: Good thing I‚Äôm both of those 
$C: No no, thank *you*
$C: Thanks, thousands of people liked it 
$C: Me too, thanks.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Me three
$C: Yes, can I also place an order for UPS man calendar? 
$C: Make it three
$C: I'll take six
$C: Send it to Walgreen's to make the calendars there. 
$C: Ill buy one
$C: Fuck, now I want to buy one.  Get em going OP!
$C: My friend would like one too
$C: Make mine shirtless please
$C: I would like one too, but with Canadian holidays listed please
$C: And me
$C: I need 4.
$C: Me too
$C: Me: me too
$C: Me as well :)
$C: I'm jumping on this calendar train as well!
$C: I‚Äôll take one too. As well as any other products you may be distributing with the Hunky Delivery Driver on it.
$C: I too, choose this guys mailroom guy
$C: I would like one please. ‚úã
$C: Me, too, please!!

$C: me too plz i love package size differences
$C: I‚Äôm waiting for mine. 
$C: Me three
$C: Yaaaaassssssssss
$C: LMAO!!!!
$C: Please launch a Kickstarter! 
$C: How much for the nude edition?
$C: I‚Äôm dead at these replies üòÇ
$C: Same.
$C: Me three, please. 
$C: I'll just settle for imgur links and make my own to save OP some cash 
$C: Count me in for one too! üòÇ
$C: Lmfao!! And me 3rd!!! ü§£
$C: Fwd to me too plz
$C: And one me for me. Dude hot.
$C: How much for pre-order?
$C: Me too
$C: I'd totally buy one!
$C: And me...
$C: Count me in. 
$C: Straight guy here. I want one, too.
$C: Me too!
$C: Please send me one as well ü§§
$C: Not me, though 
$C: Me too. He‚Äôs hot üòÇ
$C: One for me please too father.
$C: The more copies you make the cheaper it is so I‚Äôm just trying to help you all out by adding another copy to the list.
$C: We need to start sending this dude random things. 
$C: And my axe!
$C: Me me me me
$C: oh baby, UPS man delivering GUNS
$C: OPs alt or you live in the same building?
$C: Send him to my house. To deliver... things.
$C: what a weirdly shaped package!!
$C: How did he get his thigh up there?
$C: February http://imgur.com/P9I0sra
$C: Call the top picture "manuary"
$C: Wait... You aren't op. This guy does this to everyone?!
$C: I'd return that sound bar. Lasted two years before it just suddenly wouldn't turn on.
$C: That's exactly how I feel on January.
$C: I hope he‚Äôs a fellow redditor and sees this post so we can get some back story lol
$C: Somebody bought a soundbar
$C: dude make this a separate post. maybe more people have pictures of him!
$C: Damn...dude is jacked
$C: Do you live in the same building as op?
$C: I would think that would be summer months because of the sunglasses. You need some winter wear for Jan. 
$C: That vizio sound bar is amazing isn't it?!
$C: I would pay cash and gold for this calendar. 
$C: Lol ... he is hilarious. I‚Äôm in lust. 
$C: damn bro your vape is huge 
$C: Hawt. 
$C: Sign me up
$C: This. (LMAO) üëèüèªüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
$C: Does UPS offer a clear packaging option?
$C: $25 I'll mail it directly to you. 

Also for anyone else wanting orders just pay pal me $25. This is totally legit and not a scam. 

I also take crypto, Nudes of op's mom and ice sculptures. 

$C: I want to see him deliver his own calender. 
$C: "At one point, I was having affairs simultaneously with Ms Estefan, Ms Gaynor and Ms Steinem."

"Sounds like a good time!"

"Good? It was fucking Glorias!"
$C: Hah! You just *know* he'd take a picture of the package and the photo on the wall if that was done, cause that's what I'd do if I had fun.
$C: Me too!! I love **hot** men in uniform! 
$C: [removed]
$C: Who are you? Michael Scott?
$C: *Shipped individually.
$C: when i do give a gift i'd like to think so, but on the flip side unless i think its a good or fitting gift they're not getting anything from me.
$C: right?! i know i'd absolutely love something like this
$C: You two need to get together and throw a surprise party for the delivery guy!
$C: What‚Äôs y‚Äôalls neighborhood? Specific crossstreets and address?

SS#?
$C: Can I move to your apartment complex just so I could order stuff and be blessed with the pictures of this guy delivering my stuff? 
$C: /r/TwoRedditorsOneCup
$C: what are the fuckin odds of finding your neighbor on reddit ? 
$C: Please make a calendar of these pictures. You can donate the money to charity, too!
$C: I love how its a screenshot image of an image
$C: Anyone else contributing to the calendar so we can buy it? 
$C: This is why I love reddit ‚ò∫Ô∏è
$C: Now the three of you kith!
$C: /r/TwoRedditorsOneCup
$C: Can I move there? Lol
$C: Now kith
$C: Wow your username is an obscure reference
$C: Holy Crap! This is why the internetz was invented! You guys have to become besties now.
$C: Don't forget about /u/_idon_tge_tit [over here](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/9bx0o9/i_get_an_email_every_time_i_get_a_package/e56ixkx/):)
$C: /r/tworedditorsonecup
$C: The Goose and the Shrimp :)
$C: Could you get his # for me? Lol
$C: I‚Äôve had that happen a couple of times. Not recently, though!

EDIT: I lied! Didn‚Äôt check the email from earlier this week!!
$C: He's certainly delivering the gun show!
$C: Thicc vein
$C: He's easy on the eyes... Weird faces and everything
$C: r/tworedditorsoneapartment
$C: But there‚Äôs only three pics in all, unless I‚Äôm missing something? 
$C: This is a GREAT idea... and then post it in the mailroom!
$C: Toit
$C: PROVE! PROVE! PROVE! PROVE TO ME YOU'RE NOT A ROBOT! LOOK AT THOSE CURVY LETTERS!
$C: [deleted]
$C: Plot twist: OP is the neighbour who is the mail guy.
$C: fucking thank god I‚Äôm not the only immediately cynic asshole at the party. 

I would‚Äôve bet my left chopstick OP was ‚Äúthis one guy...‚Äù. 


$C: Not only did I deliver, but had to pay for plane WiFi, create imgur account, and am currently burning the last 10% of my battery. 

All to keep my reddit reputation intact... lol
$C: I literally just followed him, and not a private account at all. Maybe he got the message and decided he's better off just accepting the reddit deathlove?
$C: How did you accidentally make the second 0 of 800 into a capital O?
$C: He's doomed. 
$C: I just requested him for sure 
$C: Hes doubled the followers in 2 hours.
$C: He just checked his phone I guess and accepted them so far (myself included) and has currently jumped over 300 more, and counting probably

Edit: over 1,800 total now
$C: I just looked at every damn picture. And am following now. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Yep already doubled since they said he had 800 and I just checked haha. 
$C: I‚Äôm follower 2,039, so he‚Äôs definitely on his way!
$C: 2600 followers now, so that's a gain of 1800. Not bad
$C: I can only upvote it once, jeez

$C: This plus the other redditor that also posted a picture from a delivery. 
$C: It was like an hour old when you posted, give it time and it will be higher
$C: Why @dolloppodcast I wonder.
$C: Yes great idea!  I'm not on Instagram, but I hope someone will do it
$C: Thick thighs save lives 
$C: Fing about Arsenal is, they always try an' walk it in.
$C: absolute legend, throw this guy in instead of mustafi 
$C: Saw Arsenal in bio. Instant follow. 
$C: Fing about Arsenal is, they always try an' walk it in.
$C: 1261
$C: What is it?
$C: It was always private.. 
$C: Why? What do you have against pit bulls? They're ridiculously friendly dogs when raised with the love and attention every other breed gets. 
$C: You had better appreciate them!  This should be standard !
$C: That man is a fucking peach. If more people did one silly thing to brighten a customer's day every day, the world would be an amazing place to be.
$C: Make sure you let them know that you enjoy and prefer them.

Because all it will take is a SINGLE person complaining and they will tell him to stop... unless he has more positive replies than negative.
$C: that guy delivers 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Hope he's on Reddit
$C: True Love comes in all shapes and sizes
$C: I have to use one of those machines when I drop off dry cleaning going to start doing this from now on. 
$C: UPS sees this and hell probably get fired lol
$C: OP is very close to sending himself packages
$C: I went to College with him. Hell of a guy. 
$C: I want more pics of this silly man!
$C: Do you order packages with the hopes of getting these pics? I would.
$C: Please can you upload all of them?
$C: Just saying, if I were you I‚Äôd let him handle my package everyday!
$C: I'd order something every day just to get one
$C: Detlef Schrempf!
$C: "I don't need this, but I do need the picture..."
$C: I figured you were the one in the pictures 
$C: Seriously make a calendar I need it.
$C: Even when it's raining or snowing?
$C: I really hope dude doesn't get in trouble for being such a fucking dude. He's amazing. 
$C: If I were you I'd just order random small stuff just so he keeps making deliveries lmao
$C: We hope for calendars.   Nice little side business to make some extra cash. 
$C: Start buying your orders individually every day instead of together to get more packages 
$C: You probably order more stuffs just for the photo
$C: Detlef Schrempf?
$C: If you make a calendar of these - as has been suggested, I feel like you should include him in the, no doubt, massive profits. 
$C: Send an email to his company and tell them how much you love his photos that he leaves you. That way if someone complains then they will have you backing him up.
$C: By the way, phenomenally obscure username
$C: Everyone start ordering stuff and ship it to OP‚Äôs house!!!!!   
$C: Please tell me your name is a reference to Detlef Schrempf
$C: Do the idea the people above said! Collect enough and then make him a calendar as a Christmas gift for next year hahahaha
$C: Admit it.... You order stuff just for the delivery
$C: Hell, I'd be taking daily use of Amazon Prime just so I'd get more photos!
$C: Are you in Oregon? He looks exactly like the UPS guy for our apartment 
$C: Is this what made you sign up for amazon prime?
$C: dude that‚Äôs Colby ... are you in Charlotte NC? 
$C: I would order some stupid shit just to keep getting these pics
$C: Don't forget #nohomo.
$C: Dread it.  Run from it.  UPS arrives all the same.  And now it's here, or should I say, I am.
$C: He's gay
$C: This Guy Delivers meme. 
$C: Well, what are you waiting for? Be the change you want to see, I'm waiting for your new format...
$C: He delivers...
$C: Penis.
$C: r/suddenlygay
$C: I LOL‚Äôd way too hard at this that what was necessary üòÖ
$C: r/SuddenlyGay 
$C: Oversized packages are welcome/mandatory 
$C: I just want pictures of his package. 
$C: Yeah... I hope he's a really cool person irl. I'd be so happy.
$C: Lots of returns too.
$C: Agreed. He‚Äôs hot af 
$C: Milk Man don‚Äôt get scared‚Ä¶ not with free pussy at every doorstep.

No, best to let him go on fucking your wives. Maybe he will get tired of it.
$C: Haha that obvious.
$C: ##GET HIM
$C: Yeah, my apartment has a similar thing (though no picture).
$C: Is your name based off that one pro basketball player Tom and JR pay to play basketball in Parks and Rec?
$C: Luxer?
$C: What is it? I want to show it to my leasing management!
$C: Specifically, [this](https://www.luxerone.com/).
$C: Name of the service?
$C: Amazon canada does this if no one is home. I get a text of where the package is placed. Sadly no guy or gal.
$C: [deleted]
$C:  If it was UPS, you'd probably just get a pic of a homeless guy rubbing your opened package on his balls. Fed ex might not open it before the homeless guy  pic. USPS would just react to the policy by telling you to pick it up at the PO. Then they'd lose it and tell you that they never had it. You have to hand it to the USPS Bart Simpson style of customer service.
$C: I usually just get pics of my packages at the front door of other people's apartments...
$C: Not through Prime. You must have like Optimus Prime or something.
$C: I get a picture of the package sitting in the passenger seat of the delivery vehicle.
$C: WOW U HAVE A HOUSE?!
$C: My favorite part of the service is when it shows envelopes I won't see for 2-3 days. And either does or doesn't randomly list packages. Sometimes if it lists them they'll be there that day sometimes days later, other times it won't list packages and they'll be delivered. It's the kind of quality I've come to expect from USPS.
$C: They'll send pictures of packages too. Issue is people usually don't send packages through usps, so you won't get a picture.

It's otherwise pretty cool, they send you pictures with "today's" mail, as in what has been given to the carrier, but not delivered yet cus it's on the way
$C: I used informed delivery for a while but never got pictures of any packages, even though they promised me I would. Just pictures of all the Xfinity ads and coupons I don't want and will never use. So basically it was just more junk mail, in electronic format. 
$C: Yeah I love it. I forget when o order stuff, so it's a surprise to look forward to when I actually have a package. It's like a present! Today I got two pair of cool workout leggings! 
$C: Well duh he's got a sense of humor. That's what girl look for in a man right? (this is sarcasm, I have no idea what girls want other than ice cream)
$C: You can tell he‚Äôs still hot 
$C: He's got some guns, that's for sure
$C: I'm not very gay but I'd probably give it to him
$C: Dudes that look that good making those faces have got to be hot. He can deliver me a package any day.
$C: He‚Äôs very definitely hot and he‚Äôs got a great sense of humor. 
$C: Really?  I'm 100% sure he's attractive.  
$C: No...he's most definitely hot!
$C: I'm a straight guy, but those forearms are making me feel all warm and fuzzy 
$C: As a straight dude I can say that this dude is hot and probably gets way way more chicks than I ever could
$C: Did you see his insta? Definitely hot 
$C: https://www.instagram.com/p/BeN1HuIhTCA/?taken-by=cholloway686
$C: i guarantee if it was some skinny, pale, nerdy looking dude doing the exact same thing as this guy, the reddit post would be "Check out my weird delivery guy, hes supposed to post a pic of the label."
$C: [Here you go.](https://i.imgur.com/oQ3o1hZ.jpg) I'd say he's fine as hell.
$C: Honestly didn‚Äôt realize but you made me laugh out loud 
$C: Big sausage pizza cyanide and happiness?
$C: *"Who ordered this Jerry?"*
$C: There's millions of us that love this guy. And you know there's going to be one party pooper that somehow gets offended by it and gets him in trouble.... 
$C: Whoa, calm down. Why are you so angry?
$C: So you‚Äôre just not gonna show us the pic? 
$C: You need to post this pic.
$C: Legendary. 
$C: I like your name... Mainly what it's referring to though
$C: EMTs don't really check for organ donor status,  if you're DRT (dead right there)  then it's too late for organ donation. You gotta die or be pronounced brain dead in a hospital to actually be an organ donor. 

But a nurse or doctor and maybe a cop or two will get a good chuckle out of it for sure. 
$C: As someone who worked as a security guard who monitored cameras for two years, we see you and we appreciate you
$C: You reminded me that I also do this sometimes in grocery stores that have cameras at the self checkout stations.
$C: >I ~~sometimes~~ ***always*** do this to the security cameras at work.  


$C: And a job!
$C: I bet he has a huge personality too. 
$C: And those manly ass arms. Damn. Gotta have a talk with my gf I think.

$C: As a male, I can get behind this
$C: I think you mean "As a formerly straight male..."
$C: As a straight male I third this 
$C: As an also straight male, can also confirm. Just look at those arms!
$C: As a gay male, I also second this.
$C: Comments on a girl's appearance are usually at the top
$C: You're softer than oatmeal. 
$C: Yes. 
$C: Why? Does it matter?
$C: I feel like we should all send OP packages in exchange for pictures. 
$C: Shipped in as many boxes as possible. Like bulk cheap items like melamine magic erasers, Plastic cups, a 5 foot wooden dowel, space blankets, etc.
$C: Ya all thirsty 
$C: That escalated quickly.
$C: While he takes my colon on an adventure. 
$C: I'm thinkin' UPS could brand and sell the calendar.

Hmmm, maybe not.
$C: Same. And I'm a chick.
$C: if he does, UPS can go to hell.

$C: **Ya sound like a damn fool when you say it wrong!!**
$C: Behind me please. 
$C: And even if he's not he's holding it!
$C: He always delivers
$C: Same here! He seems like fun. 
$C: Amen
$C: straight to the point! I like your style!
$C: Whoa! 
$C: And you're a lesbian even, damn, he's turning everyone on to his side haha
$C: He is pretty hot
$C: Haven't seen any cat pics from you lately. You slacking? 
$C: Meat massage*

FTFY
$C: Paukages
$C: You define perspicacious. 
$C: Oh man.. I could totally make a calendar from his Instagram..

$C: r/subsyoufellfor
$C: This needs to exist 
$C: I checked, and you are correct.

32 out of 50 states do not restrict headphones. That means, the rest do indeed limit them in some forms.

There are additional restrictions on commercial vehicles.

I think we stressed none, obviously for safety, but also because headquarters is located in Georgia which DO prohibit them. We also have some corporate in Maryland which is prohibited as well. Additional corporate in New Jersey which is allowed.

Thanks for keeping me honest, I did say "I believe" cause I thought it to be true. I do wish you were a little more civil in discussions, but it's easy to hide behind internet anonymity and be a little off-putting. The internet is like that though.

Cheers! 
$C: https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/99olmi/who_is_paul_flart_and_why_does_it_matter_that_he/
$C: Do not worry. Zero chance that this dude will ever get fired. Plus even if he did get fired the union would get his job back pretty easy
$C: he already did
$C: I see you played knifey spoony before!
$C: Dick caught in package instructions unclear
$C: There is. This is a local delivery service
$C: Definitely not true. You can see the shield. Because it's blown up and it's positive PR he won't get fired for stealing time, maybe a warning.
$C: Paul Flart. Good rest his soul.

*AHHHH! THAT WAS SCARY!* 
$C: You're a dork. 
$C: You must be bored. üò§‚ù§
$C: You should, im the worst.
$C: Yeah, married couples never make jokes. There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm in a healthy marriage and can say these things because my partner and I are confident in our relationship. /s
$C: Or maybe it‚Äôs because he seems hilarious?
$C: They actually make pretty decent money 
$C: Do you get the impression that you'd have trouble getting women without an illustrious career? That's rough.
$C: Exactly! Someone who makes the most out of things in life 
$C: >thinking my comment alone means i hate women

God i wish you were not such a pussy. Maybe then i would take you seriously.  I don't hate women. Im not a dumbass like those incels. You and i both know there is a bit of truth to what i said. Stop trying to appeal to everyone by acting like a bitch. 
$C: >incel

Not quite. I actually know when to not talk shit about a girl if she doesn't deserve it. I am just speaking opinion. Just witnessed a thread where the girls were pissed off at men looking at her beauty. Figured its fair game.

Don't compare me to those idiots.

$C: Right. My bad. UPS it is. *Fixed. 
$C: Pump Speeddelivery
$C: UPS get my stuff to me or my buyer on time and with great info, FedEx get it to you at some point. USPS is just like you ordered something ?
$C: I seriously didn't write this wtf?!  I cant be hacked cause who would write that?
$C: Yeah, but my point was that this obviously isn't a selfie, so who took the picture? Look at his arms
$C: Uh, i guess lol

Don't have to be all petty about it lol
$C: I stand corrected.  Also I thought right but yes left.
$C: Nahhhh...i did my testing in the  early 90s lol
$C: You prolly right, but I'm not gonna gaze at his picture as closely as you did, it's prolly gay or something. But it's def got done military influences in that shave job. Jus saying.
$C: You only think I'm annoying because I'm a cunt. Which you obviously hate, because it's obvious you're gay. But it's 2018, NOBODY FUCKING CARES.
$C: It‚Äôs sexual harassment

I think I am very good at American rhetoric on presidential level.
$C: ooh, what happened?
$C: Godamn it, you're right.

Can we get this guy un-famous please? 
$C: We have to come up with a sob story, how OP is the saddest person ever with the worst life, and, supposedly, this delivery guy  unknowingly brightens his day every time or some shit. That‚Äôs how you get on Ellen and this guy becomes a hero, not a goof. 
$C: Listen, we saved that guy from carbon monoxide so we got plenty of karma to work with here
$C: UPS is unionized. ;)
$C: We are by far the most powerful Network of nobody's in the world.
$C: Yeah delivery guy is getting fired :(
$C: Yeah I was just thinking the same thing. No good fart or funny picture on the job goes unpunished. 
$C: His brown shirt looks like he's UPS. Depending on the strength of the local union wherever he's at, he shouldn't have a problem with termination.
$C: Yeah the puddle splashing van guy was hilarious
$C: If this guy gets fired, he'll have 100 job offers before day's end.
$C: Can confirm he isn't getting fired: He is a UPS driver and we love it. On a project working with lockers and this was sent to me by our project manager this morning. 
$C: On the real though, fuck those cunts that fired homeboy.
$C: Ellen should hire him to carry in the gifts she gives to guests, and have a running joke where she says "sorry, he's not included in your gift". 
$C: What'll it take for me to get a conversation with Ellen?  I'm not nearly as handsome as the fella in that picture.
$C: She'll probably give him a lifetime supply of packages.
$C: Yes please. I do want her to find this guy and give him the limelight for a few minutes :)
$C: ...How?...

This is so intensely disturbing.
$C: Usually I see it the other way around. Reddit first and then trending on Facebook later.
$C: You're probably seeing reposts
$C: with Reddit Silver!
$C: UPS is usually pretty cool about stuff like this. They see it as free publicity and know that people will revolt if their favorite driver is gone. You may only get a few packages a month delivered, but businesses that get daily deliveries that have a good relationship with their driver will throw a FIT if a new driver gets put on their route.
$C: I literally got fired from an IT job because I was "Too Friendly" meaning I talked to people too much when resolving their issues.
$C: Agreed, I only make about $30/hour right now haha
$C: "Hey there, I have a package for you..." *queue porn music*
$C: no, please sir. thank you. only you. *moans erotically* 
$C: I would like to pre-order.
$C: Mark me down for 2.

$C: Me a thousand 
$C: Yeah, gotta have one for our homies to the north
$C: Maybe a [Shotgun-Axe](https://streamable.com/b59ft) combination of some sort.
$C: He definitely lifts more than packages
$C: Absolute UNIT. 
$C: He is the package 
$C: Holy shit. Right? Hope he has permits for those babies 
$C: I worked for ups and I‚Äôd say the jobs not hard pretty straight forward but very physically draining, it wasn‚Äôt uncommon to have someone pass out from dehydration, our managers would constantly fill up our bottles of water and remind us to take short breaks cause it‚Äôs easy to try to just work through it since there‚Äôs a lot of packages 
$C: He's packing some alright 
$C: That's how we roll.
$C: Vizio makes guns? Actually, I‚Äôm not that surprised. Nothing surprises me anymore.
$C: Special delivery for I.C.Weiner ;)
$C: I went on a gun purchasing binge about a year ago, the UPS guy started to look at me funny when all of the boxes came to my door. You could tell many of them were upper and lower receivers. 
$C: Nope, that's definitely a different mail room.  I've had that screen shot since January, just shared it with friends.  Not much of a poster but when I saw his face today, I knew I had to contribute.
$C: dying to know this
$C: Looking at their comments, writing style, and subs it looks like the same guy. Biggest clue is the particular way they use hyphens.

>thought-provoking - where (B)
$C: It looks like that picture is in a different place. They both have a generic drop ceiling but in OPs pics it's a flat back wall with what looks like an elevator on the right and in this other pic I see no elevator and the wall pops out closer to the camera on the right. I guess it's possible if the camera is posable and has a wide range of motion but if it's a static view it's a different place. 

The wall in OPs pics seems to have some kind of seam near the top that's not in the other pic too.
$C: Candle wicks.  You ordered candle wicks and want him to deliver them.  That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre referencing right?
$C: Does he deliver down under....

In Australia. I‚Äôm in Australia. 
$C: Looks like a sound bar
$C: No personal attacks!

$C: Lol all the naive people saying exactly what it is because their minds haven't yet been corrupted.

$C: Inside the company it‚Äôs drivers like this that really pride ourselves on our customer service.  I wonder if this is the normal driver...when you have your own route you tend dial in your customer service and really make the people on your route happy.

First, each of you make a pic like this of you getting a package.  Print and frame it as an 8x10.  Then on the same day/time/place send that pic package to each other.  On the day of the expected delivery of the 2 packages, wait (aka stalk the mailroom) for his arrival and after he has delivered them,  present them to him as his favorite customers.

$C: I have the feeling I couldn‚Äôt afford a place that emails me when I get a package.
$C: Yeah I always wonder why some people send pictures of the camera roll, but not the picture in the camera roll. 
$C: Need pics not because I don‚Äôt believe you, but because I like this guy
$C: Pics or it didnt happen lol
$C: It has been like 10 minutes- why don't we have an updated pic?! We need it

$C: The things we do for that sweet sweet karma.
$C: [He's definitely got the message.](https://i.imgur.com/iD5bOr5.png)
$C: It was private when I requested him about an hour ago. He accepted, and he must‚Äôve made it public. 
$C: I'd been at the bar!
$C: Very doom.  Much follower. Wow. 
$C: It's not a private account so we can all follow without approval!!!! ... I just followed, he's at 1030 followers, if we want to start a count.
$C: Whats his IG name?
$C: 1809

$C: It‚Äôs been 12 minutes since you commented. He now has over 1.7k....
$C: is this why democracy fails sometimes?
$C: You need more alts 
$C: Please stop. I can only get so erect. 
$C: Because it's hilarious? And probably keeps him in a great mood driving around all day. 
$C: üòÇ I blew air out of my nose very quickly, but I laughed really hard inside.
$C: 1527
$C: Pit bull 
$C: He's the true private dancer
$C: 10/10 would recommend 
$C: But if it was standard, then this post would be about a guy who just holds up the package sticker to the camera.
$C: The sad thing is, this is the kind of guy who will get a complaint against him from some cranky old bitch for being unprofessional, or making her uncomfortable or some shit. But the faceless asshole knocking around fragile packages will keep working.
$C: totally..i try to make a small joke that is not lame with every interaction i have outside....granted i rarely go outside for me it seems like a treat
$C: Agreed. Even if it's silly and weird like this, just... do something interesting.
$C: you know one of these days some prissy stuck up bitch is going to complain about his antics and he will be reprimanded. You will think he got fired because the hilarity stopped... and all your pictures will be of the label only evermore. 
$C: Until you get those customers with no sense of humor, who complain that this is "unprofessional." Those people are out there, and I've had to deal with them. :(
$C: This is why I always try to write hilarious things in the comments section of orders (unless important details are needed, obv). 95% of the time I get an amused response from the recipient. I've even had delivery dudes follow through with ridiculous requests like "Sing hakuna matata with me when I open the door." At an old job we used to ship out bio specimens between centers and I started a long chain of responses inside a box that was passed around to like 20 different locations. 


It's just fun to be silly. I always appreciate it myself and I like to have fun with strangers. Makes life so much fun.
$C: As someone who runs customer support for a company, this is one of my main goals. A better world, one delightful interaction at a time. 
$C: did someone PM you JAR JAR nudes?
$C: Yup this is true. In my life ive worked as a cashier as well as in a call center.

You learn to gage who you can joke with and who you can't pretty quickly. And even then you can get a surprise shift in humour/mood all of a sudden! 
$C: I want this man to deliver my child
$C: This comment is underrated 
$C: If this guy delivered them, you‚Äôd be tracking two packages if you‚Äôre picking up what I‚Äôm puttin down
$C: I hope op finds a way to give back 
$C: If it was this guy, more orders.
$C: Pretty sure this is a luxer one unit. They take a picture of the label when it's delivered so the amazon delivery guy could technically do this as well but probably wont because he's sad amazon treats its employees like shit.
$C: Yeah. Besides, it's not like I'm single or anything.
$C: Can confirm, am in hell and it‚Äôs on fire. 
$C: ;)
$C: Wot
$C: Overnight
$C: ‚ÄúI know that can‚Äôt be a dig at me. I‚Äôm Al ‚Äòthe Mail Man‚Äô Bundy...I deliver!‚Äù

$C: We have that! No fun pics though just boring labels. 
$C: Yeah it is luxer. That is what I have seen around here anyways the few apartments I have delivered to with these.
$C: Ups does not take pictures of deliveries. Amazon is the only one that I know of that does this.
$C: I usually just get pics of other people's packages delivered to my apartment's front door
$C: treasure hunt!!
$C: Same. I get a picture of my packages in the mail room of the apartment down the street.
$C: Yup. Or a house you lived in 6 years ago.

Hope those bastards are enjoying my mermaid bath mat.
$C: Happens to us too. Or a note said "left in the patio" and we're in a 2nd floor.
$C: Mine are so blurry; I can't even tell if it's a pic of a door.
$C: My prime does. Depends on the final delivering carrier though.
$C: Yeah but it‚Äôs soooo cheeeeap
$C: It *is* the government. Can't be expecting miracles now can you.

> It's the kind of quality I've come to expect from USPS.

Underrated understatement. 

!redditsilver
$C: > people usually don't send packages through usps

??? i think most *people* do use USPS because it's more convenient, but most businesses send through UPS/fedex because it's easier for them. either way, >50% of my packages end up being delivered by USPS anyway
$C: I've never gotten a picture of a package, just scanned fronts of letters.
$C: If I wanted pictures of packages I'm sure I could find a relevant subreddit.
$C: Huh I don‚Äôt get pictures of packages coming to me.
$C: I use it to see if I have to go to the mailbox that day.

$C: French fries!!
$C: >I have no idea what girls want other than ice cream

That's probably all you need to know to date me, tbh
$C: > I have no idea what girls want

They want security.

At least, that's what they're yelling whenever I'm around.
$C: Delivery guy body, Wall Street income
$C: Why not both?
$C: In reliably informed that girls want world peace and a new VCR.
$C: Humor for sure earns points. Ice Cream earns points. Get me ice cream and take me to a comedy show and you're in!
$C: Don‚Äôt forget chocolate.
$C: That's easy dude. Money, multiple orgasms and beautiful shoes that dont hurt like hell.
$C: Don't forget chocolate. 
$C: Ice cream is exactly right.
$C: I am not a girl, so obviously the only thing I look for in a man is my penis. 
$C: Cheesecake
$C: Yes, a sense of humor. But not funny like a clown.
$C: Am girl: hot and sense of humor are definitely welcome. Ice cream is good too, though.
$C: I mean, you're not wrong.
$C: Am girl, 10/10 would date him for his humour, and I hate ice cream unless pecans are involved. All we really ask is ya ain't a creep, and ya make us feel important.
$C: "Humor", yeah. If this guy was fat with a neckbeard, this comment section would be filled to the rim with stupid "soy" comments. 
$C: we want lots of lipsticks..and nail polish..and shoes..and purses. fuck it. we want everything!!...and a diet coke
$C: Why else would everyone being obsessing over the guy the way they are?
$C: Of course he is. That's why it's funny and cute. If he weren't, people would complain to the company about his inappropriate and harassing behavior. 
$C: >he's got some guns 

In the larger box, or the smaller package?

Seems an odd way to have a weapon delivered.
$C: /r/suddenlygay

Coming soon to Sean Cody ;) 
$C: omg you have a kid!
$C: Hahaha I think most people have a little bit of gay in them, even if it's not enough to drive us to act 
$C: (If he‚Äôs, you know, into that)

God bless you sexually secure straight dudes tho. You give me hope.

EDIT: Lmao, what the hell was so offensive about this comment that caused it to get downvotes? After seeing a ton of "no homo" and various other iterations of fragile hetero guys on Reddit, it's nice to see a straight guy who acknowledge another dude is attractive. 
$C: And good politics, which makes him hotter 
$C: You didn't realize you laughed out loud? ;) 
$C: It must be the road rage! 
$C: Lol, I don't think I have it anymore. 
$C: I don't think I've got it anymore
$C: Dude thank you. You‚Äôve just made my little vision of the joke a little more accurately specific. 

I‚Äôll also try and be sure to live long enough to be harvested. 

And honestly, the thought of them taking my entire body but having my wife sign for and be handed a bag with my penis in it... or however it works. Man so good. 
$C: Seen anything u can't explain or witness something?
$C: I just stare at them awkwardly...they always break first. 
$C: And my axe!
$C: And a wedding ring lol
$C: And driver's license!
$C: And a wife!
$C: That's what I call my penis too
$C: And a big ass dick. 
$C: Damn, after all the years, I just got this joke 
$C: Upvoted for manly ass-arms. 
$C: ‚ÄúBaby, only get packages sent through UPS!‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo reason..‚Äù

$C: Grocery store by my house used to hire out for some kind security guard/greeter part time job.

The guy who was there most often was a friendly and great guy, and we'd sometimes chat it up a bit.  One day he told me he got in trouble for talking to the customers too much, and a few weeks after that, he was never there again.


Always felt bad for him for that, since he really was a nice guy and friendly and fun to talk to.  And really, he wasn't even really there for security, they have a plain clothes loss prevention guy full time who does that, so he really was just for greeting mostly. 



$C: That's some bulllllllllshit. 

I've been held from a management position because I "Smile too much and are too friendly"


Also, not a single male had been chosen for that management position out of 7 changes of seats since the new head supervisor took over. Head supervisor has a "Girl Power!" Sticker on her car. Some how I can't believe that not a single male being chosen for the position out of 7 chances is just coincidence, especially when one of the hires had just gotten their qualifications/certifications for the level job shes managing the month before and had 0 experience while I had 4 years experience with the job, and another 3 years experience with the property itself. But I smile and respect people too much to tell people what to do.

$C: My DH is an IT director. He had to speak to his helpdesk guy because he was too friendly. Apparently, the young women he was helping thought he was being creepy and hitting on them when he was just trying to be friendly. Luckily, it only took one embarrassing and uncomfortable conversation to make the situation all better.

One of the upper management there when I raised some concerns about packages being delayed or not even attempted to be delivered actually started yelling at me on the phone. When I asked for her manager she told me she didn't have one. Good times all around!
$C: >either way, >50% of my packages end up being delivered by USPS anyway

In many places UPS often drops your package off to your post office and has them do the trip to your door for them.

$C: I may have to look this up . I‚Äôm a security guard 
$C: /u/PaulFlart
$C: you can get fired for farting?
$C: Farthing security guard? Now I'm curious. 
$C: We had a security guard who would walk around singing songs. He would do it to serenade customers. I called him the singing clown because he would do it to girls a third of his age and it was cringe worthy. He got fired but a couple mo this later I saw him doing his bit on one of those baseball game promo shots outside the stadium. I yelled out ‚Äú it‚Äôs the fucking singing clown‚Äù. I got the clip off YouTube and sent it around the store. 

I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs singing at some young girls hoping he gets some where ever he is. 
$C: Unaware of this one. Got a link there, bucko?
$C: I‚Äôm not sure but if he brought the question here chances are he just wanted to affirm what was already in his heart.
She was probably a mean ol‚Äô jerk.

 Any costume suggestions?
$C: It's really shitty when they can the guy everyone likes. This came as a total surprise to me because a lot of people were saying how much they liked me and how helpful I was. We (me and the other helpdesk guy) even got commendations from other departments. After talking about this with current friends and coworkers, we've surmised that the dude was scared for his job because he had just been promoted to manager after 5 years and here I come, knowing more than he does, and getting a lot of commendations on the first few months of the job, also I was 4 years older than he was. He saw an opportunity to can me and took it. I didn't like that job anyway, it was boring as hell.
$C: > That's some bulllllllllshit.

You're telling me! The other reason was "I need to learn how to talk to people" because I joking told my manager (who was 4 years younger than me and just got promoted to the position 4 months prior) to shut up because he was poking fun at me. He also told me when I was hired that I can joke around with him because he's not serious.

>I've been held from a management position because I "Smile too much and are too friendly"

>Also, not a single male had been chosen for that management position out of 7 changes of seats since the new head supervisor took over. 

That sucks. Gotta love how white males have all the power in the working world! /s
$C: I can see how that could happen, but probably wasn't the case here since most of the people I helped were either male (I'm a guy too) or women in their 40s or older, that definitely weren't attractive hahaha
$C: Ingenious. 
$C: I‚Äôll order post, that way he delivers the calendar with a picture just for me.

$C: Ha! Love it!
$C: I can see him wearing the same uniform to a porn shoot later. 
$C: I am, unironically. 

He's pretty hot
$C: In awe at the overuse of this meme
$C: 80%‚Äôs, I use a jig to mill the other 20%. Its 100% legal. 
$C: There has to be more out there!
$C: This sounds like it could be a page-a-day calendar.
$C: Please UPS, don't make trouble for him being awesome!
$C: It would be weird if he just did it for one dude. Or romantic. You know, rule #1 and rule #2.

$C: [Reddit to the Iranian Bot Accounts today](https://i.imgur.com/x9dUvCu.jpg)
$C: Iran has bots now? 
$C: Those Persian bastards!
$C: I don't buy it either - I use hyphens and dashes all the time but I'm pretty sure neither of those are my alts.
$C: I'm not saying they're all wrong, just that it's a recurring pattern. People do use hyphens that way - it's just not super common. It was one factor among several which, while not conclusive proof, were all highly suggestive. 

I could be wrong. The more inactive poster has a small sample size of posts..  
$C: Thank you for validating my shitty internet detective skills!
$C: Right into her meat wallet
$C: I had no idea vizio made [this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vGkcgGf2Fzw/maxresdefault.jpg) 


$C: Oh, this made me really Lol!
$C: I think dude meant his penis
$C: I got a different one and it also came in a similarly weirdly shaped package.
$C: "Similarly, when I said she was blowing bubbles in the hot tub, I was talking about when we were at the Neverland Ranch...."
$C: Why do we never play Night Crawlers anymore, huh?
$C: I'd like to preorder 1 calendar  please.

$C: Every. Fucking. Single. Time.

$C: Thanks /u/xdel, very cool. 
$C: I always know before I click on the picture, but I still do it anyways. 
$C: should I be concerned or aroused? frankly, I could go either way.
$C: Dammit. Every time.
$C: That's good quality. 
$C: I knew it. But still tapped
$C: #FUCK

$C: You can tell this guy does push UPS
$C: I feel like people forget that complaints aren't the only option and you can instead recommend a stellar employee for quality work. Not implying that's what you meant, just a general observation overall.
$C: Or you know... ask for his number! Look at those forearms!
$C: Theres really nothing a driver can do to a package except either throw it out of his truck or intentionally damage it that is any worse than what it goes through during sort.
$C: Friend of mine works at UPS. Has seen a mirror that shipped arrive with a rod of some kind smashed straight through the center. 

Though I'll be honest I feel like shipping a large mirror is asking for trouble.
$C: Having received packages, yes, yes I would:)
$C: We've gotten complaints from (usually) cranky old folk about our valets drinking *water*. You know, the guys running stairs all day long. Not allowed to hydrate apparently,  that's unprofessional.  
$C: Oh god.  This is a big fear of mine.   If I ever end up with a ‚Äúlet me speak to your manager‚Äù haircut, I hope one of my friends will *call me the fuck out on it*.

Friends don‚Äôt let friends get mean looking haircuts.

$C: Or be fine with it anyway because it literally doesn't fucking matter. 
$C: ah...i work at home :)
So when i go outside it is a treat for me. I am probably the most cheerful person people meet outside because for me, that is a highlight of the day.
Gym always happy anyway
I mean shops, and stores:)

I am fine thanks though :)
$C: I wish.
$C: Except that does happen. 
$C: i couldn‚Äôt believe it hadn‚Äôt been posted when i did, but just kept scrolling and I found many.  oh well, reddit is about reposts, right ;)
$C: Hahaha very true!
$C: With his Post
$C: Or, if I‚Äôm lucky, the male slot...
$C: y'all can keep the packages.  I just want him to penetrate me anally and bareback. Oh and ejaculate in me. 
$C: ~~With his Post~~

Edit: Nope
$C: This is my new favorite way to talk about vaginas 
$C: Male slot
$C: And the coin slot.
$C: Did you just assume my gender? 
$C: Mmm...a Man in uniform
$C: Ive never gotten a dick pic in my DMs

$C: This guy gets pics of other peoples packages delivered to him.
$C: Surprised that the Gawker media links are still up.
$C: Correct, still being delivered by USPS.
$C: He actually grew up without a mom. No siblings. Only his two dads. He got sent to a all boys school starting at pre-k and never actually saw a woman until the day he finally decided to move out from both of his dad‚Äôs ‚Äúman only house‚Äù. That day is the day he met the first woman he would come to tell us about on Reddit one day.
$C: Lol well. Actually I'm gay and that comment was more like a mini autobiography. 
$C: His mom likes dudes with 2 broken arms.
$C: It‚Äôs called ‚Äúthe girl next door‚Äù for a reason.
$C: It is now ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
$C: I haven't yet found a woman worthy of one of [these](https://www.vestildocs.com/Photo%20Assets/TC-28-HD-2R_A.jpg) full of mustard
$C: Too much of anything is a bad time. I‚Äôd never date a bodybuilder.
$C: well thats sweet
$C: OP please recreate but don't die in the process. 
$C: He gave it to me. Maybe it's in a box somewhere. I'll have to look
$C: And this lamp!
$C: And my axe!
$C: And I'm Judy!
$C: Stop trying to make this a thing
$C: It certainly has a sense of humor.
$C: Yeah, I guess that's a semi-logical explanation. I've heard of calf implants but never arm implants.
$C: Just dont skip leg day.
$C: Pre-homo
$C: Promo
$C: Choo-choo!!!!
$C: As a behind he can mail me get
$C: I know, I'm verified now too... so that means my stories only show up on the Discover side of the app. I am not a huge fan. Anyways, I will try to do a drawing tonight and I will send it to you, kay? Nothing like an internet personality shaming to get motivated! Weee!
$C: that's a really long pronoun 
$C: Damn he must be constantly depressed. 
$C: Hes in a mailroom lol... they typically have counters and tables.
$C: Lmfao, you're ridiculous. I hope you're trolling and not serious, it's not like people can just not show their arms in a short sleeved shirt
$C: im pretty sure the owner would know how their package would be packed, i certainly do
$C: dude, they were talking about him on 104.3 in NYC, guy made it big time.  Next time you ~~see~~ hear a fart in a movie, I bet you it's this guy laying ass.  He should also copyright his farting noises so he can sell them for a mean profit.
$C: I think Brent Crystal talked about him on his podcast too. 
$C: You mean Tom segura ft Christina 
$C: Thanks jean 
$C: Christina Pazsitzky has her own podcast now? wooh first I heard of it and I listen to YMH all the time.

$C: I like that you called it that over Tom Segura‚Äôs. I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs probably the more notable one. 
$C: Hey mommy.
$C: This vast amount of knowledge can be awkward. *Awkward* is a fucking strange looking word. 
$C: You mean Tom Segura podcast.
$C: Christina has her own podcast?
$C: > He made it on Christina Pazsitzky podcast. He's in the bigs now

Remind me, what does that pay?  Does it come with medical and dental?
$C: Also, when he got fired did you hear what a (heh) shitlord he was. 

Instantly went from being casually on his side to  being pretty alright with his unemployment
$C: They were talking about him on H3 and Joe Rogan, and I'm pretty sure he was on Tom Segura's as well.
$C: Just hers or your moms house?
$C: For using his personal phone/device while working to take the mini videos which is prohibited by his previous employer. 
$C: I introduce to you [Paul Flart](https://youtu.be/gwgfnq-VvcM) and his subsequent [firing.](https://youtu.be/TVr8FvLataQ)
$C: Did you post videos on YouTube of you farting while in uniform and on client's property?
$C: He sounds perfect for a singing telegram business.  He could start his own if no one's got that gig going on in his neighborhood.
$C: If you're perusing around r/funny this probably isn't the direction you want to go in but anyways, I've never seen the original thread, but here's the story.. . https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/news/comments/85p7k0/mom_who_killed_kids_hours_after_husband_filed_for/
$C: Yeah she was... I sent the link to gre3yfoxhound in this comment thread. I kinda feel bad for bringing it up its an awful story. 
$C: you ever wonder if she is actually one of those straight girls that just gets lesbo when she is drunk but she met Ellen and she is rich as fuck so Portia just decided to go with it and try out being gay forver? like secretly she still craves dick and each day she wonders how long she can go without it. i'm kinda fucked in the head tbh.
$C: [Help out the community while wearing this.](http://goatberries.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/goatcostume.jpg)

$C: Everyone on reddit is a bot, except you.
$C: He's not a robot, he's an LMD
$C: If you open his profile, there is a little bio blurb in the top right corner of the page. His says he's a bot.
$C: [ ] I am not a bot. 
$C: A MackBot?  r/shield truly is leaking.
$C: He‚Äôs a bot 
$C: Good human
$C: Positive.
$C: I may not recall it perfectly, because it came about across at least two seasons. Mack doesn't start out as an agent, more of an engineer/mechanic who often finds himself in altercations unarmed or outgunned. During one fight, he uses an axe. During a later one, he comments on wishing he had his axe, or a "shotgun-axe combination of some sort." Then when anti-Inhuman terrorists attack him at his home, he remembers the idea and duct tapes a cleaver to his dad's old hunting shotgun. The gif here is the eventual final form of his shotgun-axe. Later on someone even points out how impractical it is because the added weight of the axe must throw of the balance of the gun, and Mack seems incredulous that they don't understand it's a shotgun-axe.
$C: Mack jokingly asked Fitz to build him a shotgun axe after the incident with Colson (season 2, "SOS Part 2). Ever since then, the shotgun axe has been an iconic weapon since he can still use the weapon when he runs out of shots.
$C: Agents of SHIELD
$C: Agents of SHIELD
$C: Try watching again, it gets MUCH better
$C: Agents of Shield, it‚Äôs a T.V series.
$C: Maybe a [Shotgun-Axe](https://streamable.com/b59ft) combination of some sort.

$C: Yeah dude. https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9bvkqa/an_update_on_the_fireeye_report_and_reddit/
$C: Or his meat wallet. There's nothing wrong with that.
$C: *Don't come to anime club tomorrow*
$C: enough with the pics of all these hot studs...I can only get so hard. 
$C: Michael cthulhu! He makes a lot of cool video-game / fantasy weapons. 
$C: That guy is awesome. Just saying.
$C: Can I offer you an egg in these trying times?
$C: I like that game, we can play nightcrawlers Cholly.
$C: Full name, including middle name, of 2 people you have lived with?
$C: While I select these as my questions (since I don't really have a choice), I don't use the actual answer, but rather have my own way of answering them. So Ben if you knew who my highschool mascot was, you still wouldn't get access.

$C: Makes sense. He's new in town.
$C: If u smell burnt toast does that mean you're having a stroke?
$C: I'm eating a sandwich with a semi burnt corner right now. Had a fleeting moment of terror.
$C: If you smell fudge that means there's an artifact active nearby. 
$C: You might be on to something detective, didnt he remarry like instantly after her death?

$C: Boooooooooo

$C: how do you get gold?
$C: He might even have them.
$C: Mmn more like dead man lifts, curls, incline/decline bench, trap push/pull down, bi-free weight curls, wrist curls, military /overhead press, Flys, and probably a few others.... For a warm up. 
$C: underrated comment
$C: He def UPSs
$C: Go home!



And take my upvote.
$C: I try and leave good reviews on Amazon, but I don't think I've ever left a positive review for the delivery carrier.  
$C: Yeah I managed a retail store, and if anyone ever called in and was like "Hey I wanna specifically thank x employee" I made sure  to email the owner about it. It's rare enough that I think it's important when someone makes that effort.

Kinda fun to do at the  end of a customer service call that you thought was good, if they ask if there's anything more they can do, be like "yeah, can I speak to your superior?" and then give them your commendation.
$C: Yes. You can.  
$C: Can confirm. I have received positive feedback from my regular customers before. It made me feel like my customers appreciated the service and management was pleased to recieve a positive rep for the company. 
$C: Sort is just a collection of individuals doing their best impression of Jim Carrey in the beginning of Ace Ventura. 
$C: Did sorting for a quick buck on college break, during the Christmas rush. We threw 40" TVs like they were frisbees. Any package that could be thrown was. The conventional method for getting things onto the bottom belt is to drop them on the floor and then kick them into place. In sort your package is just in the way of their next break.
$C: Oh yeah. I was in sorting. Jesus. 
$C: I work at a gas station, had a woman ask for a carton of smokes that I get off the shelf and accidentally drop it ~4 ft/1.2m to the ground. Shes got a sour look on her face: "can I get one you DIDN'T drop?" myself: "OK (grab a new one), I [emphasis] didn't drop this one"
$C: In the logistics industry (handling freight/non-personal effects cargo), there are many, many more ways the driver can fk up
$C: I‚Äôve seen monitors thrown twenty feet man. I‚Äôve said this before but the only thing that gets respected is a g shock meter you can attach to the outside of your box. 
$C: You see that fragile on the package? They give no fucks. Not sure why that is a think honestly
$C: Opening their mouths... So unprofessional. Can‚Äôt they drink water on their own time?

Seriously that‚Äôs insane and those people need to relax. 
$C: Why do managers listen to ridiculous complaints? 
$C: The beatings will continue until morale improves.
$C: By the time it happen all of your friends have them too. Then it's too late.
$C: How do you know what the shipping label says isnt important to anyone?
$C: Good üôÜ have a nice day!
$C: Who are you o *o*
$C: To the back door. 
$C: He surely comes 
$C: From the post (office)
$C: Is he a Peter puffer?
$C: The ol'reddit double post. 
$C: You posted this twice?
$C: Maybe it's not the vagina... ü§î
$C: I hear that a lot actually, im one out of like 6 close friends that hasnt watched any of it
$C: He is even a true gay, delivered by cesarean.  
$C: I love Reddit. Thank you guys 
$C: You send that pitch to Netflix and remember me when you make it big. It sounds like a better version of Unbreakable Kimmy Smith...
$C: I hope I didn‚Äôt offend! I thought it was cute, not anything wrong with it, it just made me laugh the way it was phrased! :) 
$C: That came out of her own womb.
$C: I really hope your digging through every box in your house right now. 
$C: And this net, that I just found!
$C: Maybe a [Shotgun-Axe](https://streamable.com/b59ft) combination of some sort.
$C: my friend, it already is a thing
$C: I am disgusted yet intrigued by your candles..lol. 
$C: I'm here for you. 
$C: Wait, why am I not verified!?!?! 
$C: Alright that one was funny.
$C: Good point, yeah. Sorry, it's like 4am here. Need to get some sleep apparently. :D
$C: Imagine how cut throat that business would be, you know there‚Äôs always another fat guy willing to fart for cheaper.
$C: For bean profit 
$C: I hope I never see hear a fart in anything
$C: ...and then sue his (former) boss's ass off for ripping one.
$C: "laying ass" 
$C: I'm gonna need a source. Never heard of this one.
$C: Don't bother. Sony already claimed the rights.
$C: I guess whatever takes the attention away from the money he promised those sick kids
$C: No, that was burnt Chrysler 
$C: She's the official Podcast Champ
$C: Abbreviation is a fun word because it has an abbreviation (abbr.).

$C: Yes this.

$C: Yeah! She does with her husband Tom Segura, it‚Äôs 
r/yourmomshousepodcast. Try it out!
$C: True water champ
$C: I missed this, what happened after he got fired?
$C: Your mom's house
$C: Allllllllright. Guess that makes sense. 

I wouldn't get behind him in the unemployment line. Just sayin'. 
$C: What a roller coaster of emotions.  

I laughed, I cried, I farted. 
$C: I bet you watch because you are sick in the head.  But no I have not done that .  But I think people in the comments would just stink things up.  
$C: Maybe he can do that! Many people disliked my comment but I don‚Äôt know why. I guess they think it‚Äôs professional for a security guard to not do security and spend time singing lionel richie songs to 20 year old girl when he is 60. 

I guess they think sexual harassment by store employees is great.

Why didn't shield have these surgically removed and instead put mittens on her. Hell if you look closely I think a socket wrench could unscrew those. She shouldn't be an index subject, just either a death row prisoner or in an insane asylum.

Agents of shield is really bad about being cheesy and this is just the straw that broke the camels back. Also the morality of the writers is just plain moronic and awful and they couldn't logic their way out of a wet cardboard box.

$C: I try to do this when I'm out and not in a rush. Stopping a manager just to point and state that someone did something great can really go a long way. I've only ever had one person grab me later on and told me they got a 50 cent raise because I said something nice to their manager, but it's tiny things like that where 30 seconds made a good change for someone else. Generally, people seem to do the opposite and try to get strangers fired for tiny things.

On the other hand, I don't really go out much.

I can put a good word in for you though =)
$C: That's why you should be the guy that up charges for his farts. Nobody knows about fair fart pricing, and anybody that does is too ashamed to mention it. Think of it like shopping for liquor that you dont drink/know anything about but it's a gift or something. You see all these bottles, you have a general idea of price range, say $30. Are you more likely to buy the discounted $25 bottle? It's probably discounted for a reason. ("Discount farter? Are you sure he isn't a sharter?") Market rate isn't bad, but you're trying to impress people. You're going to buy the $35 bottle, even though you have no idea why it costs more. You're going to assume the people pricing it out have a good reason for putting it slightly above market rate. Your farts should be just above market rate. Chances are, they're just like everyone else's. Shit, you might even be the same as the discount sharter. No shame, it happens. Butt, you *could* be getting an extra $5 for your flatulence. Dont just be gassy, be gassy savvy.

Selfishly, I'd like to see her in more things because she's funny, but her and Ellen seem to have carved out a good life outside of the spotlight. I'm happy to never see her though because it seems like it's what they want and I can't blame them. Ellen makes a killing from her talk show and they just do what they do.

$C: Having worked many years in retail, from the bottom of my heart, thank you! People like you, though few, help erase the bat shit crazies we get on a daily basis and helps restore faith in humanity. We need more people like you! 
$C: >Generally, people seem to do the opposite and try to get strangers fired for tiny things.

I *despise* people like that. The idea that "I'll get you fired!" because, say, you got their order wrong, or you were a few minutes late with a delivery is, frankly, disgusting: you're going to try to deprive this person of their livelihood just because they caused you a minor inconvenience? Oh, the humanity!

Many years ago I worked for a chain restaurant as a barman and waiter; in practice this meant just running the bar as there was usually enough to do there to keep me busy. One day a new waitress started working with us; she was absolutely tiny, and a really sweet, lovely person with whom we were all, male and female, instantly infatuated (in a good way!). 

A couple of months into her job she and I were working a long shift together and a couple of colleagues missed their shifts; it was quite busy and I was pretty much nailed to the spot behind the bar while she and maybe one other colleague and the manager had to cover the whole floor. 

One of her customers was an infamous bitch: a miserable older woman who would come in with her utterly henpecked husband every couple of weeks, complain about anything she could in the hope of getting a reduction in her bill, and never tip (not as bad a problem here as in the USA but still annoying). That night she was on extra-cuntish form and had already moaned about a few things when my colleague slipped whilst passing her and spilt a drink in her lap...

The woman went *apeshit*: she jumped up and literally *shrieked* at my colleague - who was initially frozen to the spot in horror stammering apologies - and got right in her face, spittle flying out, until the latter burst into tears and fled into the kitchen - at which point she actually tried following her in there and I had to bar her way. The manager tried placating her - everything was immediately comped and the manager told her that we would pay for her cleaning bill (it was fucking *jeans*) - but she was incandescent and demanded that he sack the girl there and then. When he refused to do so, she started screaming again and vowed she would have *all* our jobs before finally storming out leaving the whole restaurant in stunned silence. 

My colleague was in absolute pieces but we all reassured her - shit happens! - and she got back to work (and ended up getting loads of sympathy tips from the other customers). Life went on... 

Over the next few days, though, that customer proceeded to write a series of letters to the company head office describing what, by her account, had been an intentional attack and an attempt to humiliate her, and demanding that the company sack her, the manager -  *and me for having "assaulted" her!* Not only that, but she also contacted the police with regards to this alleged assault and staff from head office had to come down and show the police the CCTV footage of the event to show that I hadn't done anything wrong!

At this point we were pretty sure that the company was going to sack the waitress - and we were making plans for what we'd do if they did - but we never found out what they'd have done because she was so stressed out by it all that she simply quit. The woman got a few quid for her "cleaning bill" and vouchers for a couple of hundred pounds to spend in the restaurant - and, stupidly, she returned regularly to spend those vouchers over the next few months. 

I say "stupidly" because her food contained so much spit, bogies and other foulnesses from all of us - me absolutely included - that I am genuinely surprised she didn't notice and/or get sick. Quite what she expected I have no idea, but I know what she got...

She didn't even let it lie there. A while later, after I'd moved on, I bumped into a former colleague who'd since started going out with the hapless waitress (they ended up marrying years later, for those who like a little romance with their customer service horror anecdotes) and he told me that they'd been in the supermarket and the bitch had seen them; they pretended not to see her but she recognised the girl, marched over and told her how useless she was and how she was glad she'd got her the sack "before she hurt anyone else"...
$C: I read an article quite a bit back that a couple asked for the manager on the way out to tell them how great the server was.  The server ended up running out to the parking lot crying and thanking them because she was on her probation period and their comment ended that, making her a regular member of the staff.  As someone who managed big box retail stores I can say that I always loved to get the good comments and did something for the staff member to say thanks.
$C: >Stopping a manager just to point and state that someone did something great can really go a long way. 

Can confirm. I worked in Sainsburys (supermarket chain in the UK) that gave out "Shining Stars" to good workers (was a ¬£10 voucher for the store, staff discount still applied as well, IIRC)

I was awared one for exemplary customer service after helping someone with their shopping and they sought a manager to commend me.
$C: Same here! I send emails when people are very helpful or are very kind. There are some very beautiful people that just by being nice have made my day. I am very thankful for them.
$C: Can confirm, have been fired for as customer angrily complaining over a tiny thing.
$C: Lol pussy that‚Äôs no fun it‚Äôs more fun to fuck up a persons day by saying they did some fucked up shit 
$C: A good manager listens, and then promptly disregards it thereby making the customer feel heard but also letting their employee be a human.

It's a win-win-win.
$C: Choo choo!
$C: Subtleties are not your strong suit 
$C: Is that a euphemism for something?
$C: Ohhhhhhhhhh!

$C: You know, I had an idea like that. A long time ago...
$C: Racoons on redbull, that does sound extreme
$C: You! You're good, you! You saw those little bandit masked bastards, with their parkour and love of trash cans, and elevated them to a sport. Fucking great! (Helps if you read this in Robert DeNiro voice from Analyze This)

...shit. Can you imagine raccoons on Redbull?!?
$C: Wait wait wait, let's get back to this meat wallet. Is it a wallet for meat? Or is it a wallet made out of meat? Either way I'd like to invest
$C: I went to add you to my friends then remembered I'm on reddit.

$C: Lady comes up to the amusement park ride I was working and says that I denied her child for being too short but the employee last week let her child on so I should let her on. Adds in that her cousin is the general manager of the park. Now while it could be true that last weeks worker did let her kid on, most of these complaints are just a ploy to get a kid on the ride and we had secret shoppers to weed out the bad employees. I asked her the date and time of when she was there and told her I would inform the manager and the employee would be punished. She walked away somewhat satisfied but also caught off guard and I didn't do shit about it because she was being ridiculous. Everybody's happy.
