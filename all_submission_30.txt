Went to New Zealand, climbed a mountain, met a bird-friend, snapped the photo of a lifetime.

$C: You should submit that to the NatGeo Amateur Photography contest they run every year.  That is an amazing, amazing shot.

Edit: it makes me oddly happy that my highest rated comment is a positive one.
$C: Wow! What kind of bird is that? 
$C: Then he ripped the aerial off your car!! 

10/10 for the photo.. 
$C: Size: "Wonderful!" Its a good size!

Action: "Wonderful!" Oh! It's in flight!

Position: "Wonderful!" The pokemon is in the center of the photo.

Special: "Wow!" This is a rare Pokemon!

Total 4000 points.

$C: ITT: This bird hates your car.
$C: That's a KEA.  A clever mountain parrot.  You're lucky he didn't steal your camera. 
$C: In layman's terms, how do you take a photo that keeps the bird in focus and the mountains behind?  Some sort of fancy lense?
$C: Post it on r/NewZealand
$C: If I know my gaming history, he can be tapped for one mana of any color too!  Awesome Photo!
$C: A bunch of people are asking me how to buy prints or high res versions of this. I am not a professional and don't have a website, but if you PM your email, I'll send you the high res version (not that high, this was taken on an iphone), and you can paypal me whatever feels good for you.
$C: Yo, sell this.

This is an amazing shot.
$C: Wow. What a photo
$C: No, I'm pretty sure that's a Pokemon
$C: Great photo, should be on https://www.reddit.com/r/BirdsOfNewZealand/
$C: This is extraordinary. What a beautiful bird. 
$C: Keplar Track?
$C: "About to snap a pic of this mountain. Doesn't get more epic than thi......"
$C: Went to New Zealand, did a bunch of cool shit, but this has to be hands down the coolest souvenir. Amazing shot and life experience, OP! 
$C: /r/parrots needs that
$C: Fuck I'm lucky to have been born in New Zealand lol no Donald Trump and beautiful scenery.
$C: Holy cow, that is a beautiful picture. 

By the way if I were you I would look into registering copyright for this picture, while it's not like National Geographic quality, I can definitely see some people try to use it for commercial reasons without permission. I don't Have an exact location to send you to get it registered, I'm sure someone here can help out. Also from a previous picture someone had taken and they were suggested to register it for copyright, the fee associated with that wasn't much.
$C: Such an amazing picture, almost hard to believe it's real. 

Great snap üëåüèΩ
$C: [removed]
$C: Amazing, looks like (drawn/painted) art or fantasy almost
$C: Wow that‚Äôs a great shot. I carve birds, do you mind if I keep your picture so I can carve this scene some day?
$C: /u/likeafish88  dude took this photo with a damn iphone. Whaaat?! Most amazing amateur photo I've ever seen and I am really wishing I could hang it on my wall forever and ever. Wow. 
$C: I recommend you watermark this pic or something, it‚Äôs already appearing local pages with no credit given :‚Äô( 
$C: Well shheeeeet, that's one of the best pics I've seen in a while, nice one op.
$C: Amazing! Trying to figure out which mountain you‚Äôre on.. is that a lake in the background?

Also psa to everyone, don‚Äôt feed the kea!! 
$C: He's just spotting shit for you so you can loot it later. 
$C: Oh. My. God.
$C: Looks like you took this shot while manning one of the warning beacons of Gondor.
$C: Holy hell ty!, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever get to see this without this picture. I mean I wouldnt randomly google a Kea because I had no knowledge of it until now lol.
$C: Came in here ready to ask if that was some kind of parrot-hawk. Was not disappointed.  


Beautiful creature! I hope we don't end up wiping it from the planet.
$C: u/yo_mama_be_like You really need to submit this to National Geographic's photo of the year contest. This would be a serious contender!
$C: Kea are amazing creatures. Very intelligent.

Believe it or not, they're actually half decent mechanics.

They can take apart a car and... Oh. Well, half decent.
$C: Upvote for posting an actual good picture of something on this sub.
$C: This bird must seek out cameras and [pose](https://www.reddit.com/r/PartyParrot/comments/6em3ao/the_beautiful_new_zealand_kea_parrot/) for them.

For the record I am NOT saying this is a repost or a photoshop. The pic I linked is quite different and quite... bad. Although I can't rule out that someone stole OPs photo, did a horrible job editing it and then went back in time to pRepost it last year.
$C: I actually gasped! Great capture!
$C: Amazing!
$C: Wow!
$C: Have anymore pics from your trip, OP?
$C: Amazing shot! üòç
$C: So stunning.  

$C: Sucks that the bird photobombed your photo!
$C: What a shot !!
$C: I'd give you a hundred up votes if I could
$C: Now get a tattoo of that bird
$C: Holy moly. What a photo
$C: That looks fucking surreal

**Great picture!**
$C: Absolutely stunning
$C: damn, that bird messed up your view...
$C: I was going to call Shenanigans but turns out that's totally a thing. Stunning.
$C: It‚Äôs so good.
$C: Is this unfiltered ? 
$C: The eagle is most probably gay
$C: Looks like he‚Äôs taking the hobbits to Isengard...
$C: A rare shot of a Kea that isn't fucking with someone's car. They're beautiful, but they're little bastards.
$C: Woah! Almost the same exact pose as this shot: (https://www.reddit.com/r/PartyParrot/comments/6em3ao/the_beautiful_new_zealand_kea_parrot/)
$C: ITS FUCKIN......TREYWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
$C: It‚Äôs like catching a legendary pokemon 
$C: all colors from white light interference?
$C: Shot on iPhone? 
$C: this is beautiful, wow. thank you for sharing! 
$C: Amazing photograph. Truly once in a lifetime. Congrats. 
$C: Legendary pokemon
$C: Am I the only 1 that thinks this looks Photoshopped? The bird
$C: What a fantastic photo! Well done.
$C: Wow, it sounds like a wonderful experience. The picture is beautiful!
$C: Take me on your next trip. I have a good feeling about it.
$C: wow, that is truly spectacular.
$C: Beauty, most sublime!
$C: Looks a little like the Kepler Track? Great shot!!
$C: Wow. Photo of the day!
$C: Wow. This photo is insane. People wait weeks to get shots like this. Good job!
$C: Wow!
$C: Did it steal your stepladder?
$C: The new Pokemon Snap looks pretty dope.
$C: Beautiful birb.
$C: Great shot! 
$C: Breathtaking!
$C: Cool middle earth 
$C: Kea bird if anyone wants to know. 
$C: Climbed a mountain and met a mythical creature. So, a typical hike in New Zealand?
$C: Wow
$C: Holy crap that‚Äôs amazing 
$C: Amazing. 
$C: And yes photo of a lifetime. Should be a copyright. 
$C: This is insane. This will definitely be my screen saver
$C: Congratulations on your peak.  
....now what?  
Albeit a pinnacle life experience, good luck describing any mundane anecdotal life situation to any other human.  ..for the rest of your life.

Thank you for the background photo.
$C: Is that an Alebrij√©?
$C: Don't trust 'em. Bet you got back to your car and found your wiper blades missing or some shit.
$C: yeah, you're done.  Might as well hang up the camera:)

$C: And I have a new phone wallpaper, thank you!
$C: This is very good, just like painting
$C: Wow 
$C: Incredible shot! Great job, OP
$C: Did you use a Pok√©ball or Ultra Ball?
$C: That's one pretty drone.
$C: That looks like it could be the background of the next MacOS update
$C: That is a beautiful bird
$C: Lord of The Rings: Fabulous Edition
$C: u/yo_mama_be_like I haven't scrolled through the comments here so I don't know if it's already been said, but you need to submit this to National Geographic, or the Nature Channel, *somewhere*. This is an award winning photo, hands down. 

And copyright it. Copyright the fuck out of it, especially now that you've shared it here.
$C: Is this what getting a real life sync point is like?
$C: You now have a spirit animal.

$C: Did you end up throwing the Ring into the lava ?
$C: That's a kea... an alpine parrot you'll typically find in the South Island of New Zealand.

They're beautiful, but they love wrecking cars with their beaks...
$C: That bird offered x10 xp and a great loot drop, should have battled it. 
$C: r/fakealbumcovers
$C:  Climbing up on Solsbury Hill

  
 I could see the city light

  
 Wind was blowing, time stood still

  
 Eagle flew out of the night

  
 He was something to observe

  
 Came in close, I heard a voice

  
 Standing stretching every nerve

  
 Had to listen had no choice

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
 I did not believe the information

  
 I just had to trust imagination

  
 My heart going boom boom boom

  
 "Son," he said "Grab your things,

  
 I've come to take you home. " 
$C: Dude... That is the most magestic photo I've ever seen. I agree that you should submit this before someone else steals it and does. Incredible.
$C: Brooooooo I‚Äôm biking across New Zealand in two weeks, super excited but super nervous. If you have any advice about anything I‚Äôd super appreciate it!
$C: Great photo. But I tell you what, screw Kias. I was near fox glacier in the Alps last year and not only did they eat through my tent but they took all the rubber off my pelican case and screamed at us all night long.
$C: This is some National Geographic shit. Absolutely splendid.
$C: These birds apparently eat the kidneys right out of the local sheep.  Yikes! https://youtu.be/o8mQiXKKfWw
$C: Congratulations! I normally avoid pictures because I tend to feel they let down the image I have in my mind... But when I see these they make me want to take it up again! 
$C: Remarkable bird, the Norwegian Blue... BEAUTIFUL PLUMAGE!
$C: Copyright the image now!
$C: I am not looking for karma at all obviously ... I just want to say incredible shot, my friend ... that is truly, as stated, a photo of a lifetime. 

Just ... really ... wow.


~ another amateur nature photographer friend
$C: That is such a beautiful bird
$C: Add a mana pool of any color.
$C: Proper good. That's eligible for going on a stamp
$C: Did you fly with the bird
$C: Looks the same as a bird from a BBC show. [https://imgur.com/gallery/EbKeRSU](https://imgur.com/gallery/EbKeRSU) 
$C: Lucky bustard :)
$C: Nice Kea shot!! I am from New Zealand and haven‚Äôt seen one in ages
$C: Which Pokemon is that? Seriously though, what is that majestic creature called?
$C: Incredible shot but I cant help but feel like you really should have watermarked this. 
$C: That's stupidly over-saturated. It's like a kea-when-you're-on-LSD or something. For those wondering, [this is what they really look like](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Kea_in_Flight_MC.jpg) (similar angle).
$C: Now this is /r/pics content! 
$C: I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs a Thunderbird...
$C: What kind of dog is that?
$C: Is that Ho-Oh? üëÄ
$C: Amazing, with all the ugly in this world seeing beauty warms my heart. Thank you for sharing 
$C: Outstanding 
$C: Wow.
$C: Incredible this belongs on the front page
$C: Beautiful shot!  I think r/earthporn would like it.
$C: Holy shit that's sick!
$C: Jaw drop photo. Well done
$C: Birds of Paradise
$C: That looks like Ho-Oh to me. 
$C: You really flew always with this one OP. 
$C: Bird friend? That's a kea, watch your keys and everything else!
$C: Hope you didn't feed it
$C: Worthy of a submission to NatGeo, I‚Äôd say!
$C: You should try and enter this into a few wildlife/nature contests.
$C: holy fuck bro I mean god damn 
$C: He was hoping to take your camera apart. 
$C: That is an awesome shot bro. 
$C: Kea bird. Mischievous buggers, and super smart. 5 year long maturity period 
$C: Amazing! I‚Äôd be overjoyed if I managed to get such a lovely photo.
$C: I would frame this so hard.
$C: Should have watermarked this! It's such a great photo!!
$C: Omg, i was reading the title rly quickly and thought you snapped its neck or something.
$C: that is most fantastical 
$C: Are you one of those Disney princesses?
$C: I can hear the flute playing in the background as it flies away
$C: Is that Mount Roy?
$C: Wow that's majestic..... Real sad that only a few remain.
$C: Stop lying to us, that's Gandalf's familiar. 
$C: What a shot! You lucky, But prepared, shit!
$C: Of a lifetime.  You said it.

$C: CACAAAWWWWWW CACAAAWWWWW!
$C: Is that Lake Angelus south of St Arnaud?
$C: lookin like a screensaver, idk man. Could've just stole this from a photographer

$C: Great shot! What kind of gear?
$C: üòâ
$C: IM A PEACOCK YOU GOTTA LET ME FLY
$C: Came right after this for me. Thought it was a real-life reproduction! [https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/9yjlwv/new\_card\_janalai\_the\_dragonhawk/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/9yjlwv/new_card_janalai_the_dragonhawk/)
$C: This is exactly the type of content I like to see on this sub. Great shot ! 
$C: It's Kevin from Up!!
$C: Are you going for a big year?
$C: One of the coolest photos I‚Äôve seen. Well done! 
$C: Yo this too good it should be the Windows 15 wallpaper.
$C: Cool story bro (for real)
$C: That looks like something you'd find in the jungle tbh
$C: This pic couldnt be more perfect 
$C: That's beautiful.
$C: What kind of butterfly is this?
$C: Nothing more graceful than a beautiful bird soaring in the NZ mountains
$C: Yo Mama Be Like Dam! Great photo OP!
$C: I don't think my imagination could even capture something so breathtaking.  Thank you for sharing this!  
$C: Right before it ripped the windshield wipers off your car! 
$C: In a word, wow!
$C: Damn, that's a serious pic!!! Hope you sent it in to Nat Geo!
$C: Wow real life Bird of Paradise!
$C: Did you feed it? Is that why it came so close?
$C: This post gonna get like 97k upvotes
$C: Oh ya well I played like 10 hours of red dead so. But seriously help me
$C: Wow!!! I hope you enter this into some photography contests! Beautiful! 
$C: Very strong suspicion it was photoshopped. The lighting and motion is off. Where is the bokeh? 

&#x200B;
$C: Are you sure you weren't transported into a Harry Potter movie? 
$C: Did you ride that thing to Middle Earth?
$C: Amazing... I might get into photography to get shots like these. You should submit this somewhere or sell it or something... or just treasure it for yourself. Your picture, your choice.
$C: Looks like Australia's DLC was worth it, op. 
$C: How would I go about getting a copy of the original for my wallpaper that is beautiful
$C: Was this taken with a phone?
$C: You should have posted with a watermark, Apple might want to give you some money for this beauty! Guard the original accordingly  :)
$C: This is Nat Geo worthy. 
$C: It's rare you see an impressive bird in new Zealand since those stupid incompetent eagles.
$C: That IS a picture of a lifetime!  Beautiful.  Thanks for sharing.
$C: Can only imagine the feeling if i'd managed to take that picture , good on ya ..... now put it on tinder
$C: This is only possible in New Zealand. Nothing else to do but play with sheep. Or if you are a Rugby fan. They do have the best Rugby.
$C: Wow..
$C: I love Keas and New Zealand and Kiwi things, nice picture !!! Ma mama be like
$C: Fortunately the bird doesn't need to worry about the cost of living in New Zealand.
$C: Amazing!
$C: This is a cool bird and I don't think I will ever come across one like it again. I remember I went through Arthur's pass and I stopped at some rest stop and something I had only seen in cartoons happened: a man walks out of a cafe with a hotdog and right before he is about to bite into the dog a kea comes in a grabs it. WTF. Then it lands on a bathroom stall's roof and gulps that dog down. After it's finished eating it it starts to laugh at the guy, who is running after the bird. I couldn't believe what I saw and I'll never forget it. Hilarious. 

I wondered for a moment why there are so few of these birds left, but since they are really annoying I'm not so surprised. 
$C: A Lifetime is such a strange metric.... just say you peaked early.
$C: Wow, that's amazing! Was the bird close or did you have a really high power zoom lens?
$C: Why use lot word when few word do trick
$C: Thank you for an amazing wallpaper 
$C: Holy fuck! That‚Äôs an amazing capture!  I saw them there, but my pictures don‚Äôt look anything like this!!! Very impressive. 
$C: Wow!
$C: You get a lot of those down here. Hope you had as good a stay as this picture! Bloody good shot bro. 
$C: Wow what a fantastic shot!!!
$C: You make it look so easy.
$C: Woww

$C: I got thru a whole day without pissing myself, so l got that going for me. 
$C: Kass!! Just like BOTW
$C: This is amazing! 
$C: Well could have on the contrary googled bird pics :p
$C: Amazing
$C: Detective Pikachu movie promotion featuring Ho-Oh
$C: Holy! This is insane!
$C: Beautiful birds to look at.  Complete dicks when they come to eat all the rubber off your car.
$C: This is a keeper, awesome shot!
$C: Absolutely stunning.
$C: pretty sure those birds are carnivores so your lucky to survive that mountain climb 
$C: Same colors of a hummingbird but on a hawk. Dope
$C: You'll never take a better photo. Print it big and frame it. 
What's it shot on? I wanna guess a micro 4/3 body?
$C: Looks like he‚Äôs heading to pick up Frodo and Sam. 
$C: nice picture
$C: And we‚Äôre sure this isn‚Äôt a Red Dead screenshot?
$C: Wow. Stunning photo. That‚Äôs one for wall 
$C: yep, that's fucking dope.
$C: You absolutely did man .
$C: What a beauty! May I use it as a reference to paint a gouache / acrylic stained glass?
$C: Great photo man. Please frame this and put it in your house somewhere 
$C: Fly fly fly brotha
$C: That is absolutely beautiful!  Nice picture!
$C: Lucky bastard
$C: Holy shit, I‚Äôd frame that on my wall a dozen times over. I‚Äôd just have this one picture hanging all over my house, because it‚Äôs _that_ beautiful.
$C: Legendary pokemon Ho-Oh!
$C: You should submit that to nat geo 
$C: those birds are not your friend, they will attack the shit out of you for pocket change. Why are all NZ birds assholes? 
$C: Whaaaattttt!!!! That‚Äôs awesome,
$C: That's a Phoenix
$C: Dude thats dope AF. I like nature photography and this gives me a huge boner. 
$C: It's actually a seagull that just came from Burning Man...:D 
$C: What a wonderful experience. Thank you for sharing it.
$C: beautiful 
$C: Thanks for the phone wallpaper! [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/SLNHw4K.jpg)
$C: Wow!!! That's truly incredible, glad you got to experience that!
$C: How close were you? That looks insanely close. Awesome pic btw.
$C: What kind of camera set up do you have? 
$C: A wild Ikaros
$C: Wow, is this somewhere between Queenstown and Wanaka? 
$C: If I found a fresh dead one, I‚Äôd totally make a garment of some kind out of its feathers. 
$C: is it just me or does the perspective make the bird look fucking huge? like one of gandolfs birdy bois.
$C: Ho-Oh is real! 
$C: What a CRACKER.
$C: OMFG! Awesome photo of an amazing creature in an amazing location! 
$C: Kea are only the best bird ever. Glad you got one showing off their beauty colors!
$C: Is no one going to mention that they have a weakness for sheep kidney and will tear open live sheep, eat their choice bit and leave it alive?
$C: Yo momma be like dayum that's a pretty bird!
$C: Great shot! Great car insurance ad! 
$C: Pok√©mon Snap!
$C: For some reason I preemptively read that as "Went to New Zealand, climbed a mountain, met a bird friend, snapped his neck"
$C: It's a ho-ho

Are you by any chance ash ketchem*
$C: Priceless
$C: That bird knows how to flex.
$C: Hey OP, I'm planning a trip to NZ in a few months for just about 3 weeks each island. Would you mind sharing any recommendations for what to do whilst there, besides glow caverns, beaches, and rafting?
$C: You should copyright this
$C: That shit is majestic as fuck
$C: he photoshopped it.
$C: Yo thats my mate Frank üëâüòéüëâ
$C: Wow looks like an eagle 
$C: wow wow wow wow wow
$C: I actually scrolled through the comments in high hopes that it wasn't photoshopped in some way because it's so amazing. I'm so happy for you that you got to see this and feel fortunate that you were able to snap a photo. Super cool
$C: Almost like a "meta bird friend*
$C: Do you mind if I add this to my desktop slideshow?
$C: Has this pic been edited? Cropped? 
$C: Expect people to contact you over this one. Seriously gorgeous.
$C: The eagles are coming!
$C: This picture is moving. 
$C: He also met a human friend! 
$C: Cheeky Kea
$C: Almost seems shopped - wow
$C: Hang it up because you‚Äôll never come close no matter how hard you try.
$C: That can be a poster or a motivational quote. Great photo!
$C: Pretty much National Geographic. 
$C: Great shot of Fangorn!
$C: Shit on Deborah's desk
$C: Those are fucking smart birds.  Cheeky too.
$C: This is surreal, There are professional photographers that camp for days for a chance at a shot like this....


$C: NatGeo says you‚Äôre hired. Great photo!
$C: Cue Ezios family (Assassins creed theme)
$C: Holy fucking wow. 
$C: Wow!! Have you got a high res version of this? I‚Äôd love to print it and frame it in my house. 
$C: Damn.
$C: Nice
$C: Peter Jackson approves that. Also he claims copyrights. 
$C: Damn that‚Äôs one lucky photo. Nice job!
$C: omg these birds are WILD. Drove up a mountain and parked to take in the scenery & the birds just started attacking cars. Hilarious, scary, and also sad because they‚Äôre so used to being fed by tourists 
$C: I did the Kepler track last year and at one of the huts I did not pay attention to the safety briefing. We were supposed to tie the laces on our shoes and hang them up or the Kea would get at them...

I did not and woke up to a friend of mine laughing at whoever had left their shoes on the floor and were now strewn all over the lawn. A couple of holes and the soles scattered around was all they did and I was super lucky I did not have to walk the remaining 30 or so kilometers back to town barefoot.
$C: Serious disdain for rubber 
$C: Photo shopping is a pathetic way to present 
$C: Stunning photo!  I do hope this will actually make it out of the computer and onto your wall!
$C: Gorgeous!
$C: So beautiful. 
$C: The cheeky kea...check out the show beaks and brains.  Kea are very smart birds.
$C: I can‚Äôt tell that isn‚Äôt a Canera but a cell camera. What phone did you use to capture this?
$C: .
$C: WOW That's an amazing shot !!! As a New Zealander, I would love a larger resolution version if one exists ? I'm a printer/sign writer by trade and would love to print and hang this in my home. Either way just beautiful üòéüëç 
$C: Amazing photo
$C: Holy shit that's amazing!

Hope you enjoyed your time here!
$C: I'm 100 this will be buried and a futile comment...

THAT PICTURE IS STUNNING,  I'm sure you will see many amazing things in your life but I DO SINCERELY DOUBT you will ever capture it so perfectly again.
$C: Amazing stuff.
$C: Thank you for my new wallpaper
$C: Bravo!
$C: How does it feel to have reached your peak at such a young age? 

You're a master among students
$C: Amazing shot! Hope you had fun in NZ! üòç
$C: Gorgeous!!! I remember those guys all over my rental car, picking at the plastics :D
$C: That is one majestic creature
$C: Yes, you did.
$C: Nat Geo! Do it!
$C: What kind a bird is that 
$C: That‚Äôs a beautiful photo. Copyright it man. 
$C: You are now permitted to die happy.
$C: Learning to Fly by Pink Floyd automatically started playing in my head 
$C: Parrot hawk?
$C: Nice kea bro 
$C: Worth it
$C: THIS is what /r/pics is for! 
$C: The bird's even looking back at you like "Did you get it?!"
$C: Hoe Lee fuck that is amazing. 
$C: Show me the raw file or it didn't happen! If this was a phone I find it hard to believe that you got that close unless you were baiting it... 
$C: Too bad the face isn't on the other side
$C: Besides winning 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th & 6th place in contests, this would make an unbelievable upper back tattoo.  Full colored and flared just like the wing tips on this beast!
$C: So glad I got to see this photo
$C: Tell him I said hi
$C: Wow amazing photo, it almost doesn't look real.
$C: So you go to see the closest thing to Ho-oh IRL. Respect.
$C: Looks like something out of breath of the wild.
$C: What was this shot with?
$C: HOLY MOLY!
$C: This is my phone wallpaper now and I feel I should pay you for it.  Amazing shot!
$C: Wow.  Amaaaaazing shot.
$C: I take it you've already used your master ball? 
$C: Thank you for sharing this beautiful photo.
$C: Remarkable. Also, was this taken at The Remarkables?
$C: Damn, his colours are amazingly beautiful
$C: What an outstanding photo you snapped, i agree that you should send that in to nat geo for that contest. Really great 
$C: What a great picture. Thanks for sharing.
$C: That is awesome.
$C: This looks like it should be a puzzle. 
$C: Amazing picture!
$C: You sure did, that is magical!
$C: It's nice to see a photo that actually fits the intended content of the sub for a change. 

Great shot OP
$C: Keeeea! Greatest birb of them all. Smarter than a crow, more colourful than a rainbow, more cheeky than a faceful of ass!
$C: He‚Äôs pretty cool, take him a treat with you next time you visit. He might come to see you one day. 
$C: Stunning 
$C: So just a casual tuesday?
$C: r/photocritique complaining about how close the bird looks to the ground and mansplaining what the rule of thirds is.
$C: #nice try, but the lighting is all wrong.
$C: I want to hike New Zealand one day....

No bears...
$C: Wow nature can be so beautiful and that‚Äôs why I love protecting it and safely viewing it as to not bother it..I‚Äôm so glad it has allowed me, a useless human, to be part of it for a short time... thank you so much nature and trees and pretty birds!!! I actually shed a tear writing this cause I mean it.  
$C: Are you there for PHAROS?
$C: Possibly one of the greatest pictures ever
$C: Winner winner chicken dinner 
$C: Can you tell us more about the friendship you had with him?
$C: someone lost their parrot 
$C: That's a gorgeous bird and a great view, good job!
$C: 90% sure this means you're going to be a Pok√©mon master
$C: Looks like a rare pokemon
$C: Incredible!!! I didn't know these birds existed!! 
$C: Dude. Awesome shot. Almost one in a lifetime. Congrats!

I've tried to find a scarlett macaw many times but failed.
$C: Beautiful picture!
$C: Yeah, turn in your camera.  It's not even worth trying to ever beat that.
$C: Spoiler, this majestic bird promptly flew to a nearby car and started ripping off the windshield wipers.

Amazing shot OP. Kia Ora! 
$C: Wow!! I'm in awe of this shot, way to go! 
$C: Spectacular
$C: Amazing photo.  These little bastards like to destroy cars.  Also one stole a marshmallow out of my hot chocolate at the Arthurs Pass cafe last year the prick.  I still voted for them in Bird of The Year though.
$C: Wow! Such an incredible picture. 
$C: This would be a great skin for Ikaros in AC Odyssey 
$C: Amazing!
$C: [U coulda had a Tomahawk achievement & a swell hat~!](https://i.imgur.com/kmsocOF.jpg)
$C: How far to Hobbitton? Or may be Rohan? As the bird flies.....
$C: I‚Äôd be pretty angry if I climbed all the way up there and a bird got in the way of my pic
$C: Beautiful!
$C: That sure is a [pretty bird.](https://giphy.com/gifs/Vqr8gWPL0e4iA)
$C: Forgive me. I just didn‚Äôt expect to see that kind of picture. I misjudged you, yo_mama_be_like. 
$C: Reminds me of Zazu...
$C: Ho-oh dat u?
$C: This is the best image I can remember seeing on reddit.  
It is absolutely stunning. I would buy a large print of that in a second. 
$C: That‚Äôs
Amazing
$C: one of the best snaps ive ever seen
$C: That‚Äôs a textbook cover shot. 
$C: How did you come to take that photo? Just a really good camera and a bird taken far away? Or it was just close by?
$C: Great pic! What did he steal from you?
$C: Awesome shot. Kepler?
$C: This is simply breathtaking. It looks so unreal, I'm impressed.
$C: Awesome picture! amazing click
$C: What camera? 
$C: This is amazing. Can I please buy it?
$C: That birds feathers looks like all the paint samples from lowes glued together 
$C: Very nice. Looks like a bird you'll find on a Legend of Zelda video game.
$C: Gee whiz, that is a great shot! Is that some flavor of parrot?
$C: Very cool
$C: [removed]
$C: That is real?  Dude you are damn good. 
$C: When did you do the hike? I just finished this morning??
$C: holy shit!
$C: Whats that flight like Fam? It's the main thing holding me back.
$C: My new background thank you. 
$C: Did your bird-friend try to steal your lunch? Cause until you've had your lunch stolen by a parrot, you haven't truly experienced New Zealand
$C: Gwaihir the Windlord
$C: Kea are the absolute best. 
$C: It‚Äôs a pretty sweet mountain, but that birds in the way
$C: Calm down there, Ash. 
$C: Wow. Great picture and amazing bird

$C: Wow. Absolutely incredible photo!
$C: NZ here, cool shot of a kea 
$C: Bird man has left the mountain.
$C: Al Smith.
$C: Awesome shot. These are the best I got of them on Kepler. https://imgur.com/a/ehwKvzw
$C: a successful piece indeed
$C: Impressive. The framing, colors, depth... It's all perfectly executed. 
$C: Beautiful birds but they can be dicks.
$C: Thank you for the wallpaper!
$C: Would make a great tattoo.
$C: Beautiful!!!!
$C: Just... wow

If  that moment was not meant to be, . . . 
$C: This would be an awesome puzzle
$C: +50 u/kinnytips 
$C: Jeweled Makaw?
$C: What a beauty!!!
$C: Every time I scroll back up to look at the photo, a different detail jumps out. Absolutely stunning work! Thank you for sharing. 
$C: That bird is ginormous! 

Seriously, though, great picture. 
$C: This reminds me of Rescuers Down Under. 
$C: Reminds me of the movie UP pretty much the premise of the movie, AWESOME!
$C: Just glad to see it wasn't portrait mode... 
$C: Hey that's my bird! :)
$C: Thank you for bringing /r/pics back to its roots. For now at least... 
$C: That is a beautiful mountain range,.... to bad that damn bird got in the way
$C: Wow!!!! It‚Äôs like a feathered rainbow!! Excellent photo. 
$C: Can someond make a 16:9 wallpaper edit?
$C: How does it feel to know, with almost total certainty, that you have achieved the pinnacle of greatness that you will surely never surpass?
$C: Holy shit!  Those colors are photo-shopped, Gotta be??  riiiight?  Freakin AMAZING!  =O
$C: This truely is an epic, once in a lifetime photo that ¬®pro¬®spend decades trying to capture. I hope you shot this in raw for post processing, you could make some serious money reselling processed prints. Congrats!
$C: Thanks for the new wallpaper!
$C: They are such cheeky birds. When we went to NZ they pulled off the black strips on our hire car roof where you can put roof racks. They‚Äôre super cool though and not shy in the slightest. 
$C: Wow!!
$C: Majestic as fuck
$C: You gonna start your Pokemon journey soon?
$C: Reminds me of the scene at the end of the first episode of pokemon. 
$C: They are also responsable for seed dispersal of many alpine plants in NZ. 
$C: Looks like Been Lomond to me. Great shot and congrats on being there!
$C: It‚Äôs a kea (the only alpine parrot in the world) I saw one while I was there as well! 
$C: You shot this?


I shot this.


^Reddit ^by ^tomorow
$C: The world's only mountain parrot 
$C: Did he steal your keys and fuck your car up before he flew off?

Edit: keas steal your keys and fuck your cars up. Source: New Zealander, have had keys stolen and car fucked up by a kea. 
$C: You should hit Apple up too, see if they‚Äôll throw you some cash to use it in some way
$C: As an aspiring photographer, I wish to capture moments like these, not only for me, but to be lucky enough to be the one who shares fleeting moments like these, with the world! 
$C: Unreal. Nice shot 
$C: What will you do with the rest of your life?  Now that you‚Äôve peaked and all.
$C: This took my breath away. Just beautiful.
$C: breathtaking..
$C: This is stunning! Congratulations! 
$C: And ‚ÄúKEEAAAA‚Äù said the kea!
$C: What is this runestone looking icon thing. Don't tell me they added silver. 
$C: That's not your friend, he's just distracting you while his mates wreck your car..
$C: Fucking legendary!
$C: Mtg birds of paradise
$C: Bitch ate the window seals off my car.
$C: Awesome picture. Those birds (kea) are assholes
$C: THE EAGLES ARE COMING
$C: What part of the map is this in red dead ? 
$C: Hell man, that's a good shot!
$C: Incredible!

$C: Spectacular! Amazing!
$C: I‚Äôve done none of these things :(
$C: Woah! I never knew kea birds were so pretty! 

It's a kea by the way
$C: Is this in Guarma? 
$C: Now THAT is a pretty kea. Apparently they're one of the biggest parrots on Earth, IIRC.
$C: hey that‚Äôs my friend sam
$C: Amazing
$C: Yeah but did you die five times while climbing the moutain? 
$C: Aww is that a little Kea? They are so smart and have the cutest call.
$C: /r/natureislit
$C: You just made my wallpaper hall of fame. 
$C: Well...similar shot -

I am thinking that the lighting in the OP's shot was...perfect in terms of light refraction.  
Interesting bird too -

$C: Make sure you watermark a high res copy of this image dude. Could be worth a bit.
$C: Climbed a mountain? 
$C: Which mountain did you climb
$C: Magnificent. What kind of lens did you use?
$C: He's probably not really your friend
$C: My dad loves photography, he would've have wanted to know how you took that shot.
$C: For the love of God can somebody Photoshop a few beacons from LotR onto the top of these mountains!
$C: Watermark your pic! I cannpt stress this enough, people will claim your pic if not properly marked. Make sure it's clear enough to read, as you want to avoid it from happening.
$C: Yeah, I just did that yesterday.
$C: Damn this is sick
$C: Kea's can fuck off
$C: Absolutely love it!
$C: This is why I reddit, thank you.
$C: Rare pokemon?
$C: We‚Äôre thinking of going. When is the best time to go ?
$C: Was this the Kepler track? I did the Kepler track last year and a few Keas tried to steal my food at the top.  It was the most incredible thing I have ever done in my life.
$C: a Kia(kiwa? SP?)  There's a type of parrot in NZ that will literally eat organs out of still living animals!
$C: Thought this was rdr2 for a sec
$C: Wow. Is that a Green Cheek Conure?
$C: Tucan Sam has been putting in time at the gym. 
$C: It‚Äôs a rainbow 
$C: Incredible!
$C: It is really breathtaking, I realize, but can someone explain to me why it's such a great photograph?
$C: I think you were supposed to hitch a ride on that bird's back or something.
$C: Thanks for uploading such a high quality version
$C: I feel like this should be in r/writingprompts
Caption would make for a good one 
$C: Thank you, nice wallpaper :)
$C: Welp, time to start your quest to become a pokemon master and beat all the gyms.
$C: Would make a good album cover
$C: This is mesmerizing, Well done.
$C: WHO'S...THAT...POKEMON?!
$C: Wow amazing 
$C: Human point of view: once in a lifetime

Bird's point of view: just another tuesday

I don't know guys, but I think the birds know something we don't know.
$C: Holy shit. Photo of a lifetime really does this justice. What a sensational photo. Congratulations, man.
$C: Seems like a well spent day. This is an incredible capture!
$C: Awesome.
$C: Keas are awesome. They destroy cars for fun and murder sheep by running them off cliffs.
$C: There are less than 5000 Kea left, so this is a great shot!
If you want to protect these birds donate here: https://www.doc.govt.nz/get-involved/volunteer/groups/
Almost all of these groups aim to help Kea as part of their goals.
$C: This is my new background, replacing that boat in Florida picture from a couple months back. I'll probably swap back and forth... nevertheless, great picture. From a cell phone no less.
$C: When Ash sees Ho-Oh at the end of episode 1
$C: Kea ‚ù§Ô∏è
$C: Legendary Pokemons are hard to catch.
$C: Wow! that is an amazing photo
$C: That IS a photograph of a lifetime. Well done. 
$C: Kea! What a beauty.
$C: Pretty sure that's a shiny. Use a berry first next time
$C: Dayummmm, didn‚Äôt have a master ball huh?
$C: Wow almost 100k karma.  OP has topped out Reddit and it‚Äôs only Monday!
$C: Literally a lifetime picture
$C: Should've added a watermark brother
$C: I bet Apple will use this in a commercial
$C: What did you use to shoot this?

$C: Finally, a break from the typical Facebook trash that gets posted here
$C: That's fucking breathtaking. Wow.
$C: Consider licensing this photo. It's beyond amazing. 

I can see this photo on textbooks and stuff 
$C: Epic
$C: It's that the original crop?
$C: That's so cool

It must be fake

;)
$C: This photo could really make you famous. I'm even appreciating the rocks and plants in the bottom left corner, like this is Louvre worthy.

Also I need to go New Zealand.
$C: I bet Apple would use this in a commercial...time to get paid $$
$C: Follow your nose!
$C: What does it look like to birds though?
$C: Wait is that Aragorn on that hill over there?
$C: This is best picture of the year material
$C: What settings and camera did you use?
$C: this is a baby Ho-Oh
$C: This could go on a college textbook. 
$C: This is a good visual description of what it is like to boof MDMA. I'm guessing 
$C: Magnificent! Subhanallah!
$C: Hmm, yeah, the shading is all wrong. Totally photoshopped 
(/s)
$C: The Kea is the only parrot not found in proximity to the tropics.  It's incredibly smart.  I left my car door open once and found the Kia opening a container in the back of my van trying to get to corn chips.   He then followed my like a puppy when I led him away rattling the corn chip bag.  Cute af.  
$C: üòÇ You‚Äôre lucky the cheeky bugger didn‚Äôt try and steal your camera
$C: Sell it to the New Zealand ministry of tourism, yo. 
$C: Awesome shot.
$C: Stunning 
$C: Absolutely amazing! I checked the other links and most of them show the bird being kinda plan brown/tan. Why does this one appear so much more brilliant? 
$C: Nice Work is it!! looking some fake but I think that could be real nicely location in the picture good click !

&#x200B;
$C: Mediocre
$C: Magically this post went from the tens of thousands of upvotes to over 100k in minutes. This pushed a post of illegal activity by Trump's daughter to being off the top. It had over 100k and now only 30k. HMMM...
$C: I love birds. This actually made me tear up a little.
$C: Damn this blew up 
$C: Went to New Zealand (like a boss), climbed a mountain (like a boss), met a bird friend (like a boss), fucked his brains out (like a boss)
$C: Hly shit that is breathtaking 
$C: Beautiful
$C: Choice ay bro! 
$C: [quick watercolor I made :)](https://imgur.com/gallery/dV7L7sc)
$C: The only photo in which a watermark would not be tacky
$C: Your life's work is done OP. Not just by snapping this glorious picture, but also sharing with Reddit.
$C: Looks like the Kepler Track. The Keas there are becoming quite aggressive around humans because of our oh-so-tasty food. I witnessed several hikers getting their food stolen at the shelters while doing a hike of the full loop. They certainly are beautiful birds, but they've become quite accustomed to being around people, and the taste of our trail food...which is quite sad. I took a few shots of one hanging around one of the shelters we stopped at:
https://imgur.com/a/PJlNxMy

$C: It looks like a puzzle!
$C: Bruh 
$C: Is that a Kea?... beautiful bird... but when you walk back to your car, its torn to shreds... by said bird
$C: Just another /r/averagepicsofnz
$C: Wow, just wow.
$C: i think this may be the most perfect photo ever taken
$C: Kepler track?
$C: Camera man is synchronizing with the environment to reveal more map locations.
$C: You should probably submit this to apple. Shot on iphone ad
$C: Thanks for posting it in reasonably high rez, it's really beautiful
$C: I would buy this as a high quality print, if you were ever inclined to do so. It‚Äôs perfect!
$C: wahoo kiwi here üôå great shot this is awesome. 
$C: Bird flying really cool
$C: This looks like it would be on a printer ink package
$C: !invest 200000
$C: wow. Thats pretty cool!
$C: You sure did!
$C: I never comment on photos, but WOWWWWW
$C: Most beautiful country Ive been to.

And I haven't even gone to queenstown or something. I just roamed around 2-3 hours around Akl.

I'll try my best to migrate there.
$C: Bird type, anyone? 
$C: With what I know about keas, the charming bastard probably stole your keys and/or lunch. 
$C: Holy moly. This is unbelievably great. 
$C: Thats a Beautiful Kea, They're so pretty yet  hilariously evil 
$C: SERIOUSLY. 
$C: I'm going to NZ. Where was this and how easy is it too get there?
$C: You found my bird
$C: damn that's some National Geographic level shit!
$C: Sounds easy. I‚Äôll try doing that too...
$C: adopt your bird-friend...
$C: I think I've tapped him for a mana of any color before.
$C: Toruk Makto.
$C: What kind of bird is that?  Or is it edited?
$C: Tap 1 mana any color.
$C: You really did take the shot of a lifetime!!
$C: I would love a copy of your Kea pic. How much?
$C: Such a beautiful photo!!! Those birds are glorious and also very nosy hahaha. 
$C: This is my desktop background now :) 

Thank you!
$C: You should probably toss a watermark on there too. Keep a beautiful picture your own 
$C: Taste the rainbow!!
$C: one of best pics i have seen recently!
$C: Well somebody told me
$C: Kea are the vest, though very cheeky. Great shot!
$C: Nice photoshop colours
$C: Predicting now that this is going to be the top post of all time.

Beautiful photo dude.
$C: That‚Äôs the clip that happens one in a million clips and can only be appreciated by eyesight ( and camera if you‚Äôre lucky)

$C: This is actually insane! Make sure to ask for money if anyone asks for this photo!!
$C: Before I saw the picture, I thought you meant that you had met a girl. 
$C: that's a crazy good photo, OP, congrats!
$C: Does apple still do those "shot on an iphone" ads? This seems like it should be a part of it. 
$C: This is brilliant 
$C: This is one of the best pictures I've ever seen! You should be proud. 
$C: Trip to New Zealand:$2000
Climbing gear and camera:$500
Seeing the look on professional photographers face when they realize it was taken by amateur:priceless 
$C: Dang!  What are the circumstances that led up to this amazing shot?
$C: this is like the cover of a textbook good
$C: Its probably got your number bro, off to go chew on ur car
$C: Damn God releasing good DLC animals this year
$C: Wow a legendary Pok√©mon!!
$C: Holy fuck this is beautiful 
$C: Shot on iPhone? 
$C: "This was taken on an iPhone" (OP) 

-All the marketing Apple will ever need
$C: Can you please tell us what camera you used? Were you set up with a DSLR with settings to capture birds in flight?
$C: Bird-friend approves.
$C: Majestic ass fuck!
$C: You sure did. Holy flying frick What a beauty. 
$C: This is my favorite photo ever dude wowwww if you start selling prints lmk
$C: WoW
$C: Ben Lamond track?
$C: What an awesome shot.

$C: I live in New Zealand. And thus is definently a photo of a lifetime
$C: Wow! What kind of bird is that?
$C: We're you in the mountain range just south of Nelson on the south island? 
$C: The fact that this is real is insane 
$C: Beaut birb. üòôüåà
$C: That is absolutely stunning. 
$C: I actually gasped when I saw this. Incredible photo!
$C: Gonna come back to this one 
$C: Amazing shot!!
$C: You did in fact!

$C: OP give it a send man!
$C: A Kea, the mountain parrot!
$C: /r/reallifeshinies
$C: Award winning shot it is send your photographs there where you found your effort recognition.
$C: Excellent shot! Reminds me of one of the plastic birds I would balance on my finger as a child.
$C: That's a Kea!
$C: Congratulations! Your post is now the 305th most upvoted post on all of reddit.
$C: Amazing shot. Keep it up 
$C: Looks like a still from Avatar. 
$C: Great view... Your are lucky.. i agree with the title 
$C: That Is an amazing picture. The resolution, the uncommon colors. It almost looks like a rainbow hawk. 
$C: Chaire! 
$C: This is gorgeous. Amazing picture!
$C: They found Toruk Makto?
$C: You should enter that into some photography contests.
$C: One of the most majestically beautiful photos I've ever seen. To think, this was shot on a phone. Wow. 
$C: Yep, you‚Äôve peaked. Congrats
$C: Wow, that is astonishing! Nice shot!
$C: Damn son! 
$C: Wow! Great photo! How beautiful 
$C: I love my country.
$C: Beautiful shot!  +1 for level horizon!
$C: Wooooooow ü§Ø
$C: Do you know any photographers, videographers, graphic designers, etc? They could help you get started in setting up a site, HD versions and submitting the photos to competitions.
$C: great shot ! what camera do you have ?
$C: Could I ask what you shot this on and what you did to edit it (if you did at all)?
$C: You should edit to "Went to Middle Earth." 

&#x200B;

Otherwise, this is beautiful. I second everyone else's suggestions on submitting to the NatGeo or other Amateur Photography contests. 
$C: "bird-friend"... We call them green flying-piranha cunts.
$C: Ah! The Kea, I can almost hear the bird call, 

Keerrrrrah!

$C: There's a thing called the Wildlife Photographer of the Year held at the Natural History Museum here in London, and it's invariably a deeply emotional experience to visit the exhibition. This photo wouldn't just be at home there, it would stand a fair old chance of winning. It's beautiful. I'd urge you to pursue this hobby because... well, fucking hell. It's an incredible shot. 
$C: This is probably the best photo I've ever seen! Well done.
$C: That's for damn sure. Amazing photo!
$C: you made this?
$C: I hope that it‚Äôs realized: the current celebration of this photo is just as much a testament to the  unappreciated morphology, coloration, symmetry, and sharpness of features (ie distinctly formed primaries) of birds like this, as it is to the sheer quality the photograph.

(I may or may not be an aspiring ornithologist.)
$C: Nice try, thats clearly a photoshopped eagle
$C: Keas, not Kiwis should be our national bird. 
$C: as u/basmith0 already pointed out, someone is already looking to steal it.

$C: The camera ate the same 'shrooms you did! 

Amazing photo, congrats!
$C: Those birds are amazing and they are smart as hell. 
$C: That's the most beautiful Kea I've ever seen. Congrats
$C: MY GOD, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE BIRDS, I thought it was a peacock at first, but it's too small. Do you happen to know what kind of bird it is? Did you hear it make a sound? If so, what did it sound like?

Beautiful bird, thanks for sharing!!!
$C: You made it bro
$C: Amazing shoot‚ù§‚ù§
$C: Aaahhh, so THOSE were the things that carried Sam and Frodo back from Mordor after dispatching of The One Ring! Gotta say, though: They're a lot more colourful than I remember them being portrayed as in the movie. Perhaps the producers weren't bird whisperers like yourself and had to use CGI to blow up the size of normal eagles? 
$C: Apple have advertising campaigns with photos users take on their iPhones. Submit this one to apple and you might find they will pay for the rights to use it in one of their future campaigns.
$C: That's a fucking legendary Pok√©mon!

Outstanding photo. 
$C: ..... Came back uploaded  it to reddit and now I am a hero. 
$C: Then fell to my death 
$C: In the northern hemisphere we call them friend-birds
$C: That‚Äôs not a bird. That‚Äôs a legendary Pok√©mon. And you just caught it. 
$C: Damn
$C: Why is that stain glass window flying? 
$C: Amazing snap! 
$C: it‚Äôs beautiful! What camera do you use?
$C: Kind of curious how clear this picture is since that bird must have been fast. Must have been a great camera 
$C: Saruman's spies
$C: It's off to strip the windscreen wipers from your hire car.
$C: He was showing off to you!
$C: That is an amazing picture of a Kea, so majestic. It‚Äôs a far cry from the Fox Glacier car park, watching 3 of them destroying a camper van roof window that had been left open just a smidge. Those beaks and their determination! 
$C: Hell yeah
$C: It's the legendary Pokemon Moltres!
$C: Reading this outside in the cold. Am now warm.
$C: That fucker bit my hand. Is that in Queenstown? 
$C: Beautiful photo
$C: That's Ho-Ho
$C: Wow! Amazing shot. Reading that you are a fellow non-professional who is just proud of his great shot encourages me. Which camera and what kind of settings did you use? If it was me, I bet it would be all blurry. Especially if I was originally considering to take a picture of the mountains. How did you do it?
$C: My screens broken so it looked like you said shopped a photo of a lifetime 
$C: Absolutely the most beautiful thing I've seen today. 
$C: Is it cropped? 
$C: Yep. This photo is going to win many prizes. 
$C: I saw 4 of those birds do a chicken fight when I was in New Zealand. 1 bird rides on the back of another and the 2 top birds try to smack each other off. It was hilarious, but before camera phones. 
$C: Gorgeous! üí•üëå
$C: How do I give this platinum? Am I able to? 
$C: I AM SO GODDAMN ENVIOUS. GREAT CLICK, PERHAPS AMONG THE VERY BEST I HAVE SEEN IN YEARS. KUDOS! 
$C: That's a cool looking pokemon
$C: This is better than the photos that turn up on google images for kea.

What camera were you using? Such great detail on the wings.
$C: Insane photo almost appears fake...........
$C: Kea birds are ace. I made friends with one in the Christchurch Zoo that was missing part of his beak.
$C: Amazing shot, quite astonishing that this is shot on a phone! And people say iPhone cameras suck! :) Absolutely fantastic composition, there's something about the way the tip of the left wing separates the mountain and sky that is beautiful. Definitely watermark this and email yourself a copy of it so that it is server side timestamped!
$C: Now this is what /r/pics is for!
$C: Nice
$C: Wow
$C: Someone I shared with with told me it's fake. Anyone have any background?

Btw. Holy upvotes!
$C: I read "climbed a mountain bird" and I got really excited 
$C: Is this you, national geographic?
$C: The way the wingspan of the bird straddles the mountaintops behind and the ground in the foreground makes this photo extra visually pleasing
$C: Nailed it.
$C: You should submit this to ‚ÄúWildlife Photographer of the Year‚Äù at the Natural History Museum London. I went last week and this photo could absolutely get in
$C: These birds are assholes. But this photo is pretty cool.
$C: Typical grunt style pose. Sup?
$C: Wow, beautiful shot, mate.  
Well done !
$C: Amazing!
$C: Where are you from OP ? travelling to New Zeland sounds so good :)   
Taken this by Iphone make it even more cool :) 
$C: This is the stuff great music is made of.
$C: That's a pretty amazing picture.  Stunning, great timing!
$C: just wow
$C: Excuse me but if I zoom in the Mountains and especially the rock close to you look painted, please explain
$C: Love his cheeky eye peering over his wing. That's a bird that knows he's magnificent.
$C: \*speechless\*  üòç 
$C: Waaaay toooo much photoshop!
$C: How do you go about climbing mountains like that? Must you get a guide or clearance somewhere?
$C: thats a pokemon
$C: I really want to go to New Zealand..
$C: Way better than bald eagle !! 
$C: I don‚Äôt believe this is real but thank you for the picture. It‚Äôs stirring. 
$C: Are those The Remarkables, near Queenstown?
$C: I can see the beacons of Gondor being lit in the background.
$C: Stunning!
$C: what A beautiful bird :O

&#x200B;
$C: That is breathtaking.
$C: Freedom
$C: Congratulations on never bring able to take a photo that compares.
$C: Ah! I fly to New Zealand tomorrow. I'm so excited to see stuff like this!
$C: Expected a photo of Sweet Dee..
$C: This is fucking amazing
$C: Best Kea shot ever. 
$C: What equipment was this shot on?
$C: That's just fucking awesome. Well done!
$C: From your Intro and seeing the pic... the lyrics of Solsburry Hill came to my mind straight away...

Climbing up on Solsbury Hill
I could see the city light
Wind was blowing, time stood still
Eagle flew out of the night
He was something to observe
Came in close, I heard a voice
Standing, stretching every nerve
Had to listen, had no choice
I did not believe the information
Just had to trust imagination
My heart going boom, boom, boom
"Son", he said, "grab your things, I've come to take you home"
$C: Wow! What kind of bird is this. You're lucky to be able to capture a picture of it. 
$C: It‚Äôs a beautiful photo but I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs maybe Photoshop? The reason I asked is because it‚Äôs so perfect and the edging of the bird is white as if it were cut out from a different background... just asking I‚Äôm not accusing. Beautiful in any case.
$C: Reminds me of Avatar.
$C: I‚Äôm tired of seeing this fucking bird. Amazing picture. But god damn it reddit 
$C: This is a very beautiful photo, a fascinating look and a rare bird.
$C: How the heck do you get the bird *and* background in clear focus?
$C: Wicked quickscope, man
$C: 10/10 excited for memes of this
$C: This is amazing

&#x200B;
$C: Does anyone know what type of bird this is? It‚Äôs super duper cool.
$C: Awesome pic
$C: I moved here to NZ from NJ a few years ago, and lets just say its slightly better looking than Jersey
$C: Proof of God.
$C: Just circling around to chew on your lens cap
$C: This is beyond incredible! I would love to post it on Twitter, to Parrot of the Day, who is based in Australia, and posts photos of all kinds of birds, and they're quite witty, too - the group, not the birds, though having two parrots makes me quite sure that parrots can be witty. ;) I don't follow politics or people/groups who are, um, not very nice, just mostly animal stuff; I will be happy to give you my Twitter handle. I'd like to get permission, and if that's granted also give you credit. Anyway, let me know. :)
$C: Hmm if it's here it must be real.
$C: Your now a professional photographer
$C: great pic and congrats to OP on having the top post of the month in only a day! (and it‚Äôs in the top 40 for the past year!)
$C: My gosh, that is stunning! How high up were you?
$C: Well, you peaked. You may as well just go and suicide, man.
$C: Absolutely fantastic shot mate! 
$C: rainbow birb
$C: God damn keas... they are the most mischevious little shits ever. 
$C: Wow
$C: Really need the lens and settings on this
$C: This picture would be a great addition to the Kea Conservation Trust website
Keaconservation.co.nz
Beautiful shot !!!
$C: This photo is so cool!  It's now my desktop wallpaper!
$C: I‚Äôve never been more proud to live on Kea Pl .
Also am a New Zealander or do I dare say a Keawi 
$C: Thank you for this beautiful photo of my country aotearoa 
$C: Which mountain is this from? I'm assuming Mt. Cook. Damn, I just got flashbacks from my New Zealand vacation. Milford Sound Cruise was amazing.
$C: What an amazing photo
$C: It's not until someone mentioned this is the world's only alpine parrot that I googled, "alpine parrot", only to see just how AMAZING OP's photo is.

OP's photo needs to be like TOP 5 pics that come out when google-ing "alpine parrot" or "Kea"
$C: Lived in NZ for 22 years. Hands down the most beautiful natural scenery in the world. Apart from that it's boring as fuck. 
$C: What mountain is this?  Im going to New Zealand in 2020, and I wanna go here lol
$C: Having difficulty posting my comment that this photo used a stock photo.  Perhaps the OP would like to comment on using a possibly copyrighted stock photo as the background for his photo?

[Shutter Stock Photo](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/hiking-ridge-line-alpine-kepler-track-760409791?irgwc=1&utm_medium=Affiliate&utm_campaign=TinEye&utm_source=77643&utm_term=)
$C: Clearly a photoshoppe con job.  
$C: I'm tired of all these garbage photos that require paragraphs of (100% Bullshit) explanations to have any meaning at all... you are ruining this sub OP. 
$C: I like it 
$C: Can I buy a copy please?
$C: Stunning shot. Got a tattoo of one on my shoulder, colours are amazing. When the wings are folded in they are a lovely drab brown or khaki colour, but with wings out. WOW!
$C: Pok√©mon don‚Äôt like to be photographed from behind.



But seriously, this is awesome.
$C: Wonderful picture. Well done !
$C: looks clearly photoshoppped
$C: You win 
$C: This needs an photoshop battle
$C: Looks fake as hell, unfortunately. 
$C: Did anyone else think this was photoshopped? 
$C: r/natureismetal
$C: On my planet we do not have a New Zealand.
$C: That's just a Swooping Evil from *Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them*.
$C: I don't technically *want* to be a dick but there are some things about this picture that don't seem like a picture. I guess what I'm saying is I hope someone with more photo/photoshop experience than me wanders in and weighs in on the shot. What I notice:

1. Uneven telephoto effect foreground to background (depth of field on two curves).

2. 'Posterizing' of most of the background image in uniform splotchiness = PS effect (in my mind, I don't know).
$C: That's nice, dear. 
$C: I was here 
$C: Why can‚Äôt titles be straight forward? Why is there always a ‚Äúbest picture I‚Äôve ever taken in my life‚Äù or ‚Äúsnapped the photo of a life time‚Äù slapped to the end? 
$C: "God doesnt exist"
$C: I color-corrected it:
https://i.imgur.com/OaqWd73.jpg
$C: You Kea, We Kea, I Kea. Ikea? I knew they were running a parrot ponzi scheme in the background 
$C: Fucking. Amazing. Just glorious. Thanks so much for sharing!!!
$C: This is so amazing it looks so unreal, beautiful shot I love photgraphy and Im so jealous!üòôüëç‚ù§
$C: Sweet fucking picture bro!
$C: Thank you for the mobile wallpaper. If I had gold,itbwould be yours. Nice work. That's a great moment. 
$C: looks like the legendary pokemon Ash saw after bonding with Pikachu in the first episode where it rained and he fell off his bike
$C: Well thats it. Pack it up and sell your camera equipment. Youre done.
$C: Hey! Commenting here because I don't know how to edit this post and put it on the top:

A bunch of people are asking me how to buy prints or high res versions of this. I am not a professional and don't have a website, but if you PM your email, I'll send you the high res version (not that high, this was taken on an iphone), and you can paypal me whatever feels good for you.
$C: Seconding!  This photo will win contests. 
$C: OP has peaked 
$C: If you do this, being back the highlights in the sky a touch and bring up the shadows of the birds face just to open up a little more detail there.

Photo judge here.

It is a smashing shot. In terms of a wildlife shot it‚Äôs simple however with the landscape it has a strong sense of place that elevates it.
$C: I agree. However one of these bastards tried to steal my shoes at the top of a mountain, bit my friends finger, then threw a sandwhich into a ravine
$C: Hopefully under a different username, Haha. 
$C: It's so amazing it doesn't look real.  It looks like some kind of crazy super realistic CGI.  I mean that as a compliment.
$C: I hate decorating, but I'd absolutely frame this in my house. This is really incredible.
$C: Is this ‚Äútoruk makto‚Äù ?
$C: I mean OP has released it on the internet. Does this mean that submitting it is no longer feasible? Maybe they can prove somehow (timestamps maybe?) that they took the picture?
$C: Near flawless framing(assuming its not cropped) but great shot nonetheless. Submit that shit!

Edit: spelling
$C: Photos in NZ is like cheating, it's impossible to take a bad shot.
$C: I could see that being a Chromecast shot
$C: You got my upvote just for this edit :) 
Nice comment buddy
$C: I would vote for you
$C: What qualifies you as an amateur? Plenty of mostly amateur photographers might sell prints or license photos or something. Just wondering the criteria. 
$C: What makes it so good? Not being an ass, just curious its a nice shot but what makes it so special
$C: I came to say the exact same thing.
$C: Seconded. Get on Natgeo Yourshot. It's a free photo community and they're running the 2018 photo contest. This is something I'd expect to see there.

I'd even submit this to the 2018 contest which is a $25 submission fee
$C: I agree this is a beautiful shot. What makes it so good?
$C: Meh... OP probably bangs out phics like this every day.
$C: I just got an email that the deadline is coming up too, get on it!
$C: And do something to protect your media!
$C: Agreed! This photo is beautiful, I'm going to set it as my phone wallpaper.
$C: I'm going to be bummed when someone else reposts this with the same title.  Such a beautiful shot, beautiful subject, and great eye.
$C: U can go to staples and get a glossy print for $1-$3 depending on size. My friends do that and sell them for $15-20
$C: Every contest ever
$C: Lol didnt they make a photoshopped pic win 1st place
$C: We‚Äôd love to see it reposts that way!
$C: No really.  Submit this shit to National Geographic.  Doesnt matter if it is luck or skill.  If its luck, you should try get lucky one more time.  You may have accidentally started yourself a career as a professional photographer.  

You have something seriously special here.
 It is exactly as you have described.  It is a photo of a lifetime.  The kind that can change your life.
$C: r/AwardSpeechEdits impact üëèüëè
$C: Tat birb ugry
$C: Doesn't that require for the photo to be previously unpublished?
$C: [removed]
$C: I already submitted it for them. Under my name of course. 
$C: It's a Kea, the world's only alpine parrot. There are an estimated 5,000 of them remaining. 
$C: Ho-Oh
$C: There's a documentary on Netflix right now called Beak & Brain that features these birds. They're really mischevious. Literally tear apart cars and food containers and such.
$C: Interesting fact: Like a lot of NZ birds it's name comes from it's call. By that I mean that it's name and it's call are very similar.
$C: Do you still have the fat around your kidneys?
$C: That‚Äòs a Ho-oh
$C: It's a flying rainbow
$C: They're suck dicks. I love them. I have a giant one tattood across my chest.
$C: The population is endangered but I believe that it is also increasing.

$C: You didn't get the word?
$C: Yeah this is straight to the front page.
$C: [Kea Disassembly Manual](https://imgur.com/FBe6Irn)

$C: These guys are  everywhere at Arthur's pass and they don't give any fucks, nibbling through tents to get your food.
$C: It's actually an 0/1 flier.
$C: That Pokemon Snap though. Oh man, why has that game not been rereleased for mobile devices???
$C: Fucking Pok√©mon snap... so there really are other people who played this game, thought I was the only one 
$C: Marry me 
$C: I was actually thinking about Snap today! I either read or heard someone say "Wonderful!", and I heard it just like Oak in Snap. It's actually something that's popped into my head a handful of times the last couple of weeks.. 
$C: Go print that thing out at Blockbuster! 
$C: These birds are arguably one of the smartest animals on the planet. Their beaks are like Swiss army knives and they can open or pull apart almost anything in their search for food. This includes ripping the rubber lining off your car windows and many other various bits and bobs get think might gain them access to sweet food. 

David Attenborough did a pretty cool documentary about them.


$C: Nah, he LOVES your car. A little too much.
$C: Why does this bird hate his car? OP didn't say anything about a car?
$C: Jokes on him, I can't afford a car.
$C: IKEA?
$C: This reads like something Ocelot would tell Venom Snake in Metal Gear Solid V. 
$C: Yeah, they are such evil birds. 7 years ago I climbed up Avalanche Peak in Arthurs Pass with some friends and there were like 7-8 keas over there at the peak and they stole everything they could, flying in circles over us. They literally stole our cookies :(
$C: Lost my best sneakers to one of these little monsters at Porters Heights....
$C: In layman‚Äôs terms you make the hole (aperture) that the camera sees through smaller. Essentially this changes the field of view making the foreground and background sharper. In order to do this though you decrease the amount of light reaching the sensor. More fancy lenses are built so more light can get through a small hole and can see better in lower light. You can also change the sensitivity of the camera (ISO) but this can increase fuzziness or you can increase how long the camera is taking the picture for (Shutter speed) but if something is moving it will be more blurry as it‚Äôs position is changing over time. 
$C: In more simple terms, on a bright day you can get a picture where the exposition is very fast, even on automated settings.

Some birds also don't move that much when flying, perhaps was the picture taken at such a point. On a DSLR, once the focus is set (either manually or by half-pressing the shutter button for the automatic mode), then you can take your time taking the picture and hoping the bird doesn't come closer or move further away.
$C: Mobile cameras tend to do that because of the small aperture (the opening that let's light in)
$C: I would not be surprised if this photo was taken with a cell phone. Naturally small aperture due to the tiny camera so the depth of field is always going to be very wide.
$C: Every lens has an infinite focus point. When it is focused to infinity, everything at that point and beyond will be in focus. Cell phone cameras generally have a very short infinite focus point (which this one is).
$C: [Wide angle lenses.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-angle_lens) 

They're my absolute favorite type of lens and they're part of what made Citizen Kane such a revolutionary piece of cinema.
$C: This is an iPhone picture.
$C: Having everything in focus is the easy kind of focus actually, there is no discipline or fancy tool involved in that

small light hole is the answer, since you asked, cell phones have those.
$C: Essentially, allowing the general view (foreground and background) to be in focus with a higher aperture or longer range of focus (e.g. f/6 - f/20) while you wait for the shot. When opportunity strikes you snap several shots without having to worry about the subject being blurry. 

BEAUTIFUL shot, OP. Shot of a lifetime. 
$C: Use a smart phone
$C: Nah, we're over Kea photos now that T H I C C B O Y E is bird of the year.
$C: Rohan theme intensifies

$C: [[Lightning Bolt]]
$C: Not if I have anything to say about it...
$C: Every time I think I have a great original comment...
$C: Came here for the BoP reference, wasn‚Äôt disappointed. I love Reddit. 
$C: Get it registered. Copyrighted or whatever you do as other people mentioned. This is valuable don‚Äôt let it get stolen. When you send out copies state it‚Äôs intended for their private use and is not a license to reproduce etc. 
$C: I feel like if Apple gets a hold of this it'll end up in an ad. CAPITALIZE OP
$C: Amazing photo. You should submit that to national geographic it's that good.
$C: iPhone!? Well done! I was about to ask what camera you were using :)
$C: Yeah you should probably watermark all the high-res copies you send out. This is a phenomenal shot, especially for catchy internet purposes.
$C: Sell it to Apple. They might want to use it as a showcase for their camera capabilities. 
$C: You should really copyright this photo.
$C: WOW iPhone 
$C: Yo
$C: Yo, you know you can just hyperlink the last part, and it'll still send you to the right page on here: r/BirdsOfNewZealand. 
$C: There really is a subreddit for just about anything you could think of, isn't there. 


$C: Its feathers look like a mosaic. 
$C: yep
$C: Nice! I did that one too. So gorgeous! 
$C: Came here for this. Thanks! Gotta hike em all
$C: Agreed. And so my search for a kiwi husband continues...
$C: Now that you say this, I‚Äôm pretty sure I remember reading a post on /r/legaladvice about someone‚Äôs photo being used by North Face or Patagonia on a shirt.

$C: Not national geographic quality?  Hed be a finalist for sure.

$C: There‚Äôs a one way tunnel towards Milford Sound that cars take turns to go through. The Keas there learned that if they move the traffic cones, the cars will queue up and they can work their way down the line of tourists for food. They had to get heavier cones.

Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuA5tO_c7s4) of them practising
$C: I do the same thing
$C: This guy has edited his comment to something completely different. Please disregard
$C: I'm too high for this. What the hell did I just read?
$C: Im so confused, your comment is about guys wearing skirts and hitting on other guys but the replies are talking out birds breaking your car
$C: how sure are we that they're not just being dicks?
$C: They love rubber.. Had one fly into the RV on the way to Milford sound... that was fun.
$C: In other words their good birbs 
$C: A kea has stolen a pickaxe
$C: Please!!!! Show me what you come up with
$C: How do you know it was with an iPhone? Not being a dick, just curious 
$C: mt. luxmore
$C: I think that's just more mountains.
$C: Ikaros got a color upgrade
$C: Surprisingly accurate.
$C: Ive seen them and still never seen them like this. I don't think I've seen one fly. They usually are just waiting at tourist spots for free snacks.
$C: I hope not too, us Kiwis (New Zealanders) are trying hard to keep all our local animals from extinction. We currently have the only increasing Dolphin population in the world, and I know we are trying to do the same for our parrot-hawk friends. 
$C: Fun fact; they‚Äôve been known to feast on the kidneys of lambs. Also, they will ruin your cars shiny bits.
$C: U must
$C: Hell, I wana get a tattoo of that bird. 
$C: [https://imgur.com/gallery/EbKeRSU](https://imgur.com/gallery/EbKeRSU) 
$C: Looks like it's straight out of Pokemon Snap
$C: i agree, visited nz 14 years ago and our car got attacked....the antenna meant to help guide drivers not used to driving on the opposite side was pulled out and missing......We didn't know what happened at first and couldn't figure out why someone would vandalize that part of the car. 
$C: If you see one of those birds, do not leave your bike unattended for even 30 seconds, coz they will rip the seat and tires, they are insanely destructive, but adorable too haha 
$C: It‚Äôs a Kea (native New Zealand bird)! 
$C: Don‚Äôt be a hater, it‚Äôs a great shot with great timing. 
$C: They‚Äôve got a rule about no animals in the shot. Might be tough to photoshop out the Kea. 
$C: Nah, Kea can deal damage without buffs. And they destroy artifacts.
$C: There is... other stuff to do here

Also arguably Ireland is now better than us at the whole rugby thing. But yeah. 
$C: Yeah, they used to 'hunt' sheep, and so the government tried to cull them.

And now they're protected.
$C: They are, but they don't eat PEOPLE. They attack animals that can't defend themselves (namely sheep).
$C: It's a parrot.
$C: Please!!! Let me see what you come up with after, I‚Äôll pm you my email
$C: Loved Milford sound, Kepler track, AT track
$C: kea....they are destructive creatures....quite the pests in nz unfortunately but beautiful birds. 
$C: Nice try ü§ó
$C: Who says this was an iPhone. Lots of hikers are amateur photographers and have dslrs

$C: It‚Äôs a Kea, a species of parrot native to NZ
$C: Happy cake day!
$C: Kea 
$C: The photographer mentioned elsewhere that they took the photo with an Iphone 8
$C: Also that shot is pure gold üëå
$C: Yeah, I live in NZ and they are definitely real. It's a beautiful picture, very hard to get one like that, but they do look like that. 
$C: It's a Kea. An alpine parrot. A very smart bird. They're endangered too, something like only 5k of them left
$C: Why does take it by iPhone make it more cool?
$C: uh sure? i took it from the top of a mountain on a hiking trail where everyone stands and takes pictures? you can see the shadows and the angles are different...
$C: I mean it's a pretty nice picture on its own isn't it? Beats the hell out of old man holding a sign or a piece of paper saying this rock pulled ten guys out of a fire while battling cancer 
$C: I am the smarterest y
This is an iwuvyoo I am the smarterest y you have any questions or concerns please visit the plug-in settings do you have any further assistance or information I have a great time in the box and click here to visit our frequently to our frequently asked my friend I am the one I have work experience in the backyard and I will be in touch with you and your proudest moment I am the smarterest y you are not the intended addressee please notify the system and reported that the person who is this when I get a sweaty bum.
$C: I added "structure" and a filter. 
$C: The sky and back mountains look too saturated imo 
$C: Also please do submit this to amateur photo competitions. Do you know the name / breed of the bird?
$C: Make sure you only send slightly cropped versions so if someone tries to claim your work as their own or profit from you have proof that it is yours that will hold up in court. 
$C: The Smithsonian has an annual photo competition which is pretty incredible. And, in your favour, it also has a section for mobile phone photography which this would be perfect for. 
$C: Please watermark this before you do. This honestly is a once in a lifetime picture, and will sell for a hefty penny. Even if you‚Äôre not interested in money, it would suck to someone cash out on your luck and experience.
$C: RIP your inbox
$C: With an iPhone?! Awesome! Technology has come a long way.
$C: This was taken on an iPhone? As a professional photographer, Holy shit
$C: Apple owes you some marketing royalties 
$C: Keep the full-resolution photo for potential contest submissions and/or licensing.  You will regret giving it out for free!  It doesn‚Äôt matter that it was taken with a phone- international photo competitions accept all types of photos.  And the folks at Apple may be interested in it for advertising, you never know!
$C: sell this to Apple.  they can use for advertisement.
$C: Holy shit this was only shot on an iPhone? +1 for apple fanboys in the long standing war of Apple Against Androids
$C: shot on iphone? Someone send this to Apple so they can show it off in their next keynote. Brilliantly captured my friend!
$C: How do I get this tattooed on my lower back
$C: My god, then sell this to Apple and they‚Äôll put it on billboards everywhere.
$C: I want to put this up on facebook but I want to give proper credit to the person who took this photo and a way for those to send you funds for use.
$C: Water mark it.
$C: I would love a high res version for a wallpaper and would be fine with a cropped or watermarked version
$C: Submit to the shot on iPhone contest, because this is a winner for sure
$C: Send the picture to Apple. You'd make more money that way.
$C: Your username though
$C: I didn't think i could be blown out more about the awesomeness of this photo then you said that it was taken with an iphone which blew me out even further. 
$C: What‚Äôs the lake behind you
$C: That's an incredible shot man. Submit that for competitions, who knows you might have stumbled into a new career
$C: If you‚Äôre Australian enter it into next years australian photography awards (Australianphotographyawards.com.au) as it has a mobile category, so that will irk for you rather than against you.
$C: i love that it was taken on an iphone.  i'm pm'ing you.
$C: Iphone?  Wow. Which one?
$C: That‚Äôs one photo badass new wall paper! Thanks dude! 

Great shot! 
$C: Dude, trademark it and watermark it before you send it out! Companies will make bank off it if you‚Äôre not careful. 
$C: How hard was that hike? Camping or day hike?
$C: Please tell us the story of meeting this bird friend!
$C: I would never give anyone this high res. 
$C: Dude no.... get your ass on Snapfish or something to set up making prints and canvases and sell them on Etsy, make some money. If you let that file out, ass holes will claim it and make money off it. Looking at you Getty Images! Water mark that fucker now, do not let high res for out of your control!
$C: Honestly you could probably sell this to Apple if they're interested. Already looks like a "Shot on iPhone" ad.
$C: Hey mate photographer here, easiest way to get some pay and for people to print it is 500px and its a free online gallery for yourself too, upload there people can order prints and you can get a decent chunk of the profits
$C: Please make sure you mark it inconspicuously or only give up to a certain resolution in JPG. This is the kind of shot you don't want to lose to scum of the earth.

Not being a professional doesn't make this shot any less amazing, and you should hold it close.
$C: Crop a bit of the edges when you give it to someone else. That way you can prove you're the original photographer.
$C: I bet if you showed this to Apple, they would probably use it to promote and sell more Iphones. 
$C: You can upload it to zazzle.com or similar sites and offer it is a poster. You will only get a small cut from the revenue but it is better than nothing and you don't have more to do than uploading and defining a layout.
$C: This will be on apples next keynote 
$C: You should also watermark this ASAP because it‚Äôs a very nice shot.
$C: You should contact Apple PR, this could be in the next iPhone ad. 
$C: This would be a great ad for Apple if they still do the "shot on iPhone" campaign.

I never would have guessed this was taken on a phone. Incredible photo. 
$C: This is unreal. You snapped at just the right time
$C: Please crop it slightly to avoid plagiarism. It‚Äôs a tip I read online. That way you can always prove that you are the originator. 
$C: iPhone? That's amazing!
$C: I presume you know, but your photos made it to the [New Zealand Herald](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12163956). Did you provide them with the images? They look better than the version you posted here (in my opinion).

Edited to add: (in my opinion), and also congrats on getting your pics in the Herald. 
$C: Hope NZ Herald paid you for it.  Your pic is now in one of their articles. [Kea ora! Tourist captures photo of a lifetime at New Zealand's Kepler Track](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12163956). NZ Herald. 21 Nov, 2018.    

Many thanks for sharing your superb photograph with us. 
$C: You're a good guy/gal! Cool kea.
$C: You know when you uploaded this without a watermark? Yeaaa - your photo has been stolen like a million times now.
$C: Can this be made into a 2560x1440 wallpaper?
$C: For your once in a lifetime shot I was hoping the bird's visage would be visible. Thankfully there was enough info that I could bring him fully out:

https://imgur.com/a/4NcWSZj

Let me know if you want me to edit it in the high res version for you. 
$C: > Hey! Commenting here because I don't know how to edit this post and put it on the top:
> 
> A bunch of people are asking me how to buy prints or high res versions of this. I am not a professional and don't have a website, but if you PM your email, I'll send you the high res version (not that high, this was taken on an iphone), and you can paypal me whatever feels good for you.

Shameless plug
$C: Thirding. Was thinking the same thing and scrolled to find this comment 
$C: Why win contests when you can get sweet karma and have people repost your photo for years to come without crediting you?
$C: Ya saw it here first folks
$C: Which contest? Do you think he would have to submit the RAW file as proof it wasn't photoshopped? I've seen some contest winners get discovered that they doctored their images....
$C: Especially if there is a higher resolution!
$C: Thirding! This comment will get gilded!
$C: niceeee
$C: He hasn't even begun to peak. When he peaks... you'll know!
$C: Yes every digital photo needs a little photoshop work for levels and what not. Especially this one since it was taken on an iPhone 
$C: Haha cheeky bastard. Makes me like them even more. 
$C: Ahhahahaha! keas are the cheekiest buggers!
 

$C: Well, that was just wasteful.
$C: Yep, bloody Kia parrots ate the bindings off my snowboard. Don‚Äôt leave anything on the roof of your car in that magical, magical land.
$C: Yeah you're right I should use this one. Thanks for looking out!
$C: That was my first thought. It looks almost too good. 

There are people on Reddit that seem to be able to spot fakes though and nobody‚Äôs crying fowl yet. 
$C: There's a good reason for that. This image had been manipulated to hell.  Kea have very dull colouration on their backs, and while all these colors might be present they've been brightened and saturated.
$C: He has the raw, we have a compressed jpeg, he's fine.
$C: I'm not a professional, but I'll tell you what I find extraordinary.  First, the simple basics of the frame.  The rule of 3 is nearly perfect here, and that's without the bird.  You've got sky, background, foreground perfectly balanced.  The bird sits smack in the middle of this frame.  It's feathers are a stark and brilliant contrast to the rather muddyish landscape.  Second, the quality of focus in insane.  I don't know how he managed to get so much of the frame in focus, but it is impressive.  Lastly, the composition of the shot is magical.  This looks like it should be on canvas.  People wait a lifetime to see something like this up close, that catching it on film is like lightning in a bottle.
$C: No clue.  If OP wants to submit, he'll google it, I'm sure.
$C: Take your meds, dude.
$C: Had no idea there were so few left. About a year ago I hiked through a brief snowstorm to get to the top of Ben Lomond and was all alone (everyone else had turned back). It was me and a Kea waaaay above Queenstown. Really amazing 20 minutes or so of solitude. 
$C: Also an amazingly intelligent bird (able to use simple tools etc), incredibly curious, and will destroy all the rubber on your car if given half a chance (rips off the windscreen wipers, door & window surrounds etc)

[2 Kea destroying a police car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBdvRCkCNfo)
$C: And they're kinda jerks. I woke up one morning, looked out my tent and thought - "Wow, it snowed last night?!‚Äù. After my eyes adjusted, I realized it was toilet paper. Somehow while I was asleep a Kea/Keas snuck under my tent fly, unzipped my backpack which was stored in the vestibule. Then proceeded to distribute beak-sized pieces  all around the camp.  Took over 2hrs to clean it up and I was days away from more TP. 
$C: Also the only bird that is known to steal stepladders from dwarven strongholds!
$C: Keas are also one of the few predatory parrots. They use their sharp beak to dig out chunks of their prey's flesh, then lap up the blood and fat. They tend to attack in numbers, and the resulting damage done to their victim can be enough to cause death by blood loss or terminal infection. Here's a horrifying video of a kea flock tearing the back of a sheep to bloody shreds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQRU3zpUHt4
$C: What about the [Norwegian Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vuW6tQ0218)?
$C: Was warned about them destroying cars if left unattended. Went on a bus tour to Milford Sound, and passed a couple of them on a parked car going to down.

Great picture. I have mostly pictures of them walking around, which doesn't show the more vibrant colors yours does.
$C: What Camera, and settings, did you use to take this photo if you mind me asking? I'm currently getting into photography and i'm learning. Thanks!
$C: Amazing shout! You should really add this to their wiki page and consider donating to [their conservation trust](https://www.keaconservation.co.nz). it might help with their raising funds or the profile of the bird. Absolutely stunning. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Holy shit! That's awesome!
$C: Shot of a life time indeed!!
$C: a rare bird and such an amazing photo.. nz's tourism board should license your shot
$C: Fun fact: Kea is plural for Kea
$C: I momentarily confused this with the [Kakapo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakapo).  Never realized there were several species of parrots in New Zealand. 
$C: Awesome.   They actually look like conures from behind. Or close enough.   My Sully has them colors but longer red tail feathers. 

Edit,: awesome pic
$C: Make some room in your wallet. Im sure someone will pay you for this
$C: Also only world's primarily carnivorous parrot!
$C: He‚Äôs pining for the fiords...
$C: You just said it's the world's only alpine parrot and then said there were an estimated 5000 of them. Well which one is it? 
$C: Nah, that has to be a Phoenix. 
$C: Now that's my kinda burd
$C: Awesome bird though a menace. They can kill sheep and love tearing the rubber lining out of car windows and windscreen wipers. 
$C: isn't that the bird that lands on a sheep's back and opens up the skin and muscle and eats meat and drinks blood?
$C: How do they taste?
$C: What a payoff from that climb,: THAT perfect wing spread of only one of the 5,000 in the world. Excellent OP!  All of us are grateful for  your effort and capture. 
$C: yeah don‚Äôt park your car near the little bastards either! they‚Äôll steal every rubber seal you have..
$C: 4,999*
$C: And you have to build them yourself.
$C: Cheeky Keas
$C: Kias will mess up your shit. Those birds can be assholes.

They'll tear the weather stripping off of your car doors
$C: No, it's called ho-oh
$C: Sounds like something you could submit to National Geographic.
$C: Fell in love with these cheeky bastards when I was in NZ a couple years ago.  They‚Äôre so pretty!
$C: They're theiving sneeky bastards too and will chew the rubber from car doors at skifields.
I'm from Christchurch and always saw them when in the Arthurs Pass area in my youth, but on a recent trip 30yrs later was none in sight.
$C: Kea are massive wankers.
$C: Is it pronounced ‚Äúkey‚Äù or Key-ah‚Äù? I‚Äôve realized there are so many bird names that I only see written down and don‚Äôt actually know how to pronounced. 
$C: Does a pretty good job on conservation. I‚Äôm surprised there aren‚Äôt  more. Unless 5000 is the carrying capacity of where they live at in New Zealand
$C: I bet there never were that many to begin with.
$C: I read that as "Ikea the world's only airline parrot.
$C: They don't taste as good as they look.
$C: The picture and the info? You da real mvp
$C: Nah pretty sure that's Ho-Oh my friend

And you got the shot of a lifetime holy hot dang
$C: How many at population maximum?
$C: Hiked the Routeburn Trail and had the pleasure of seeing about 10 of them at the end of the trail. And a few more hiking Ben Lomond 
$C: And you're friends with him? Good job, that should go down in the history books for you
$C: You mean rainbow eagle?
$C: They will attack your car for food!
$C: What a gorgeous creature. Great shot. 
$C: Can i please get a signed print
$C: for some reason I read that as "world's only airline pilot" the first time, and I thought for sure that can't be right

jokes aside, that is a truly beautiful photo of a truly beautiful animal
$C: They're declining and wont last much longer
$C: You should check out the Kakapo, even less of them ground-parrots left. And they are so cute
$C: Second this. Saw about a dozen in a car park trying to eat the rubber off a car roughly 6 months ago
$C: South island high country, basically a massive kea sanctuary. Beautiful huh?

I once sat upon a rock on Arthur's pass lookout, and a kea cheekily came up beside me for food. Was a mere meter from it.
$C: Maybe Apple can sponsor their preservation in return for naming it the IKea.
$C: Cheeky buggers they are!!
$C: What mountain did you take the shot from? 
$C: One tried to steal my coffee cup on the Milford track. They're true assholes.
$C: No that's a place to buy furniture you put together yourself.  
$C: What an awesome sighting! Make sure you submit this to natgeo :)
$C: Aren't they them assholes who take your stuff
$C: 5000, wow so that means they got about ....15 yrs left? something like that...I really wish the wildlife of the world would fight back Avatar style...
$C: Wondrous beasts. Met some in the wild, and met some in a wildlife park... Far too friendly and hanging off my pants whilst a buddy tried to snack on my shoes haha.
$C: Kiwi here, love these cheeky buggers. On a school biology camp last year we be friended one of these guys, he was eating snow berries out of our hand. They‚Äôre surprisingly intelligent, surprised it didn‚Äôt try steal your camera.
$C: An alpine parrot, I wonder if they would become invasive in the mountains of South America
$C: IKEA?
$C: Anybody else read "airline pilot" here?
$C: I‚Äôm a super amateur photographer. I just got my first DSLR this year. Any advice for taking pictures of birds? Perhaps even any photography books I should pick up? Like for drawing I always tell people to pick up drawing on the right side of the brain.
$C: I myself don‚Äôt live in the South Island to know enough but I hear they are the biggest assholes when it comes to sheep because they tear them apart or something.
$C: I was going to make the joke "it's a mountain parrot, duh", because obviously such a thing doesn't exist. I feel stupid now. 
$C: 5000? Really I saw like 8 of them at Bristlecone ski resort.
$C: God i love this birds. spend a night in the mountains and one visited our group the whole evening. We could play fetch with him and he hopped on our hands.
Beautyful, intelligent and friendly, a really rare combination.
$C: it has almost the exact colour pattern as a green cheek conure
$C: Lots of our other native birds are endangered or are in low numbers too. Each year we have a bird year thing where people vote for a bird of the year. Brings awareness and events surrounding birds and more money going into their protection. 
$C: Why does it always have to be " there is only this many remaining" ?
$C: They have a cousin called the Kaka, which are less dickish, but one did fly at my face once when I was trying to film him.
$C: Are you sure it's not a Pokemon?
$C: It‚Äôs a great photo.  So good that it will likely be stolen by a ton of websites.  
$C: Wait how is Kea pronounced? The Ikea logo has me questioning my pronunciation. 

Is it kay or key or kia?

$C: Awesome!!! I‚Äôll be buying some art for my walls now üòÅ
$C: I'm surprised he didn't steal OP's camera
$C: Nope that‚Äôs not keas it‚Äôs kakapos
$C: And in AR! Sometimes I really have to wonder why some companies can't make better use of their IP.
$C: It's a classic! Also happy cake day.
$C: I fucking loved that game. Still have it actually, played it a few years ago. Need to get the N64 out again. 
$C: Someone is working on a VR railshooter version of this game.
$C: We exist man, just few and far between
$C: I used to describe them to tourists as flying monkeys when I lived in Arthur's Pass. They usually laughed, but I was serious. 
$C: Pls
$C: David Attenborough?  Wow, they... Spared no expense...  Wait, wrong Attenborough.
$C: Loves it to pieces.
$C: These birds are well known for being ‚Äúcurious‚Äù to the point of destruction. They will tear open backpack zippers to get inside, pull the rubber lining out of you car windows, etc. They‚Äôre not being malicious, they just want to see what you got in that shiny metal box of yours. They are gorgeous though...
$C: I'm confused too 
$C: Check comments....
$C: You assemble the parrot yourself.
$C: No. A-kea
$C: No they come assembled.
$C: [Related](https://i.imgur.com/CQnMz8J.jpg)
$C: IKEA with a NZ accent.  A KEA.
$C: Or Kia motors, "power to suprise"
$C: To expand on this in a simple way, the value on the camera you would use to adjust the aperture (hole) is called the f stop. Low f stop = easy to get a bright picture but the background will be out of focus if there's something in the foreground (like the bird). High f stop = harder to get a bright, well-exposed picture but both foreground and background will be in focus. 
$C: I think the thing that stood out to me most was the clarity (shutter speed) with such a good depth of field. The bird is crystal clear. 
$C: >changes the field of view

*Depth of field, although there is of course a relationship between Field of view and Depth of field.

>Fancy lenses are built so more light can get though a small hole

I dont think that's really accurate though, in the sense of helping with this problem because if the fstop stays the same the amount of light hitting the sensor is the same. So with Fstop being a ratio of the Focal Length to the diameter of the opening, and focal length effecting depth of field as well. Sure we can decrease the focal length, increasing the depth of field, but without also making the diameter smaller, it'll result in a lower FStop which of course decreases depth of field
$C: This was taken with an iPhone. 
$C: Since that's an awesome explanation, I'm going to ask a question that confuses me everytime I leave auto-focus: how do you work out a decent base ratio of aperture, ISO and shutter speed that I can then adapt to different conditions and/or subjects? Trying to find a good, non-arbitrary ratio of these confuses the shit out of me üòï
$C: and since the photo was taken with a smartphone, it's easier to keep everything in focus because of the small size of the sensor ...  (bigger sensors in DSLR cameras have narrower depth of field)
$C: OP said further up that an iPhone 8 was used. 
My 10 year old dslr is probably trash now. 
$C: he said he used an iphone tho
$C: For context, [this](https://www.visitzealandia.com/portals/0/Images/Birds/Kereru-Brendon-Doran.jpg) is a T H I C C B O Y E, a Kereru
$C: KERERU RIDE OR DIE
$C: Yea boi!
$C: Kakƒ´ was robbed
$C: What's the bird with the little fancy feather off it's head? Usually runs around on the ground.
$C: Honestly my first thought. If I could just have this picture well printed on a BoP I totally would use that.
$C: That's outstanding.
$C: As much as I appreciate the revised frame/text the photo would look less out of place in a post 8th frame I think.
$C: Perfect
$C: This was awesome. Thank you. 
$C: And now I miss 6th grade
$C: Gotta bolt the bird.
$C: T: Destroy target vehicle.
$C: That is so perfect. Maybe one per round regardless who the owner is
$C: Inquisitive kea: (R)(G)

1/2, flying. at the beginning of each upkeep both players reveal a random card from their hand, if an artifact is revealed this way, its owner discards it.
$C: The proper response
$C: That's ... not how copyright works.

Also, OP just gave Reddit a *worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display* the image. And they *irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to* it.
$C: You should sent it to Tim Cook on Twitter with your iPhone model. Maybe you'll get a rt. Or a new phone
$C: Iphone XS max make awesome pictures!
$C: But really, op. Pls do this
$C: He cant.  He already posted it to reddit.  Reddit rules state that any material you post is owned by reddit.
$C: Potato 
$C: I was just on the track last week and saw so many Kea wandering around luxmore hut. Small world and awesome shot!
$C: I like the transition from username to comment:

"Yo mama be like...yep" 
$C: O hi there.
$C: Registering the picture for copyright makes it that much easier to defend the picture against improper use. Not registering it allows a company to say they were unable to find the copyright owner to ask permission and so on, whereas if op was to register it would be sry fault for failing to do their due diligence, registering the picture is cheap and takes little effort for all the hassle it could prevent later on it would just be silly to not register it.
$C: You guys are talking about the amateur competition, the picture was taken on a phone and it shows. It's not some high end expensive camera with crazy exposure or some other fancy high end settings. Beautiful and great picture, but it's not on the level of high end professional photographs.

Maybe using NatGeo as an example was wrong, but I was just trying to say it's not a high quality professional picture.
$C: Everything on the internet is real
$C: Absolute legends
$C: I woke up never having heard about this bird and now I want to subscribe to kea facts
$C: yeah Homer Tunnel.  Great drive!

$C: Local legend
$C: Thanks for talking the time to note this. I was confused as fuck for a minute there
$C: That‚Äôs hilarious üòÇ 
$C: I definitely had to read through the comments to see what the fuck was going on
$C: I thought I was having a stroke.
$C: > This guy has edited his comment to something completely different. Please disregard

https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/9ylyak/went_to_new_zealand_climbed_a_mountain_met_a/ea2oyo2/
$C: He edited his comment to something completely different. 
$C: because they're birds that pull stuff apart to gather nesting material and to find food, and the concept of a car owner means nothing to them
$C: Because there could be insects under the rubber like tree bark. Als nesting material collection. But they will do this even if they don‚Äôt need it. Just to have fun. 
$C: I read the comments and he said he will sell prints but claims they're not that good because they were taken from an iphone.
$C: I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre being funny or not because internet humor is hard. But there is a small patch of blue in the far left corner, behind additional mountains! 
$C: They were asking which mountain they were on,  which is Luxmore. It‚Äôs on the Kepler Track near Lake Te Anau. Probably from Luxmore Hut which is an awesome place to stay. I was there once near the solstice and it didn‚Äôt get fully dark till around 11pm. 
$C: I‚Äôve seen them fly. Immediately after they steal some poor tourist‚Äôs lunch at Arthur‚Äôs Pass. Or after they rip the rubber off somebody‚Äôs windscreen.

Kea are assholes.
$C: Good on you guys, man! I can only hope the US will finally follow the same path. It's just a bit more difficult to get 350 million entitled a-holes to zero in on a goal. 
$C: Sounds about right for any animal near Australia! 
$C: Sorry mate, that's horrible. All we hear in the news is about the Killer Beez and the Mongrel Mob. No one says shit about the Kea Club. That's how scared we all are.
$C: Oh shit good to know!! Hahahahaha
$C: Lol.. Ireland is not better than the all blacks. No chance.

Anyways, yeah most people say New Zealand is just a more boring version of Australia.
$C: I see that.  Still looks like a hawk with colors of a humming bird. 
$C: Thanks, mate! It would be something like this:

[http://roberto.perez-franco.com/see.php?image=gou53668](http://roberto.perez-franco.com/see.php?image=gou53668)
$C: Thank you! I hope you had a wonderful time (I mean obviously besides the Kea!)
$C: Ty. Amazing looking creature
$C: I was assuming that when OP have iPhone and is shooting with it - the phone itself has a great camera which makes it better for him than shooting with big Lens

Sorry if the word "iPhone" touched you or in any way harmed you - I meant by that "Taken by the phone make it cooler"

As i have also iPhone, im not even aware of any other phones to take pics - and also might be good = which i already said sorry that I'm Ifan boy ...
$C: Perhaps you can point out where the differences are.  Unless you and the shutterstock photographer stood on the same spot at the same time, all the snow spots/crevices/trails match up perfectly.

[Compare the two](http://www.tangoll.com.hk/Kea.jpg)

&#x200B;
$C: Lol... yeah I thought it was pretty obvious I was just fucking around. It's an amazing photo...
$C: Put a watermark on it. I agree with the other comments, you should enter this in the Nat Geo contest. It's stunning.
$C: You monster
$C: I too would like to see the original.  I sent this to someone and the first thing they said was "Photoshopped".
$C: Can you post the unedited original?

 I hope that it's otherwise 'real' because it's an amazing shot. Thank you very much for replying!

This isn't a dig at you personally but I do not understand why people don't say what post processing they've used upfront in the same way that professionals outline what equipment they used to take the shot. Maybe I'm just really out of touch? 

I recognize that people just want to enjoy it and/or believe it's 100% real, but honestly how many photos are posted without editing? I don't get it: Post the original and the 'upgrade' together. Why not? Again, nothing against you personally just shouting into the wind.
$C: Yea it's way to blue
$C: It is a Kea. A bird native to the mountains of NZ. A really beautiful bird. 
$C: Nestor notabilis, which is fitting. 
$C: It‚Äôs a kea
$C: His name is Larry. 
$C: It‚Äôs a kea. They‚Äôre arseholes. 
$C: It's called a takealltheplasticandrubberoffyourcar 
Probably the smartest animal on the planet next to humans.
$C: Unfortunately no matter what OP does, [people will claim they took it](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/comments/9yoyos/snapped_the_photo_of_a_lifetime_but_i_dont_know/ea347wo)
$C: Op has a timestamp and ideally a backup also timestamped on Apple‚Äôs servers

Thats the only proof op needs. All those other image distortion techniques photographers do just ruin the image and thats it
$C: ITT: people who think a photo of a bird is worth millions 
$C: Username checks out
$C: You should check out [Unsane](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7153766/). It was shot entirely on an Iphone.
$C: Put the watermark underneath with his user name 
$C: That's what yo mama said
$C: He‚Äôs doing a ‚Äúpay as you wish‚Äù for people that specifically asked to buy it. That‚Äôs some really kind shit. 
$C: Fourthing because three‚Äôs a crowd
$C: Birding
$C: I was going to say Thirding.. thinking myself rather witty, then saw your post and realised I have no original ideas at all.  Life over... 
$C: Depends on the particular contest‚Äôs rules.  He mentioned this was shot with an iPhone, which does not shoot RAW - but iPhone photos have been accepted (and placed as finalists) in NatGeo contests before.  OP should just seriously think twice about giving out the full resolution version of the photo.
$C: Absolutely, and in competition you want to take away any technical reason for someone to criticise. Even if there is nothing necessarily 'wrong' about it as a general photo.
$C: "Fowl" ...I see what you did there 
$C: Did you really just had to----
$C: They do happen. I've got an amazing takeoff shot of a kereru with a telescopic lens , up in the tall trees above the Milford Sound ferry docks. Not quite as detailed as this mind you - but for all the photos being taken every day, ones like these occasionally pop up. Especially with phones now - more photos being taken - more likely to get one of "those" shots
$C: If he gives it raw then he won't be fine.
$C: Took it on an iphone so he might not have a raw
$C: Rule of 3?
$C: Love that hike. When I went up there were two, and they played good cop/bad cop to get food from hikers. One would flap at you and make noises while the other would hop on over and get close. If you caved they would share the spoils of success. Unfortunately many hikers fed them, which apparently is a problem for the birds.
$C: ‚ÄúIntroduced stoats and possums are the key predators of kea and are present across the extent of the keas habitat. These predators impact on the survival of kea nestlings and the survival of adult females. Stoats can reduce nest survival to near zero in the stoat plague years that follow mast events.‚Äù

Basically because we (humans) brought over an invading rodent species that likes to eat their eggs. 
$C: Hey! We have a Ben Lomond here in Ogden, Utah.  I guess you guys got a big load of Scots at some point as well, huh? Happy mountain climbing! 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Lomond_Mountain_(Utah)


$C: There's a Ben Lomond in California and I briefly got very confused.
$C: I saw Ben Lomond and thought, wait, we have Kea in Utah???
$C: Might be the normal population. It's not like Alpine regions are super productive so as to support dense birb population.
$C: Ben Lomond is great, the hike literally starts in the town and within two hours you can be in another world at the summit (okay my 1h40 climb was way faster than most people but hey).
$C: Pretty much all of our beautiful unique birds are incredibly endangered along with much of our native wildlife (like Maui‚Äôs dolphin). 
$C: >so few left

Thank humans


$C: Wow. Ben Lomond is a serious hike in good weather, let alone a snowstorm. Respect. 

(Made more dangerous I reckon because it‚Äôs so damn accessible from the town centre. 

When we hiked it there was a dumbarse tourist who got separated from the rest of his group. He was still on the saddle and only had a half-full water bottle to see him up to the summit and back. We gave him a refill of water from our supplies and tried to convince him to turn back and walk down with us. He didn‚Äôt. We asked some others on their way up to keep an eye out for him. Presumably he ended up ok. SMH)
$C: How risky was that, continuing on? Would it not be advisable?
$C: TIL there's a Ben Lomond in NZ.

Makes sense though, means Beacon Mountain and everyone knows Middle Earth is in New Zealand.
$C: But Ben Lomond is in the Santa Cruz mountains. And we don't have these beautiful birds, just assholes like crows, ravens, and stellar jays who live to hate us. 
$C: There aren‚Äôt that many of them left due to their nature... they can be some real cunts some times by eating you window wipers and getting shit out of your car but also flying Into the windscreens of cars driving in the alpine pass.
$C: I had a budgie but it died. I-I-I I like pie.
$C: Those noises are so cute 
$C: Who knew they were members of the "Fuck tha Police" club. 
$C: Defacing government property. Sounds like they need a lawyer specializing in bird law!
$C: Also omnivorous.  Normally they'd eat carrion along with their other stuff, but in the past, in bigger numbers they were pests to herders, because they'd land on NZ sheep, carve a bit of flesh off their ass (which the sheep couldn't do anything about), then fly off.  The wound would get septic and the sheep would die.
$C: That's evolution right there. That bird is smarter than most of my coworkers
$C: One of our kayaking guides told us a story of keas moving the traffic cones on the Milford sound highway and watching traffic stop and people getting out to move the cones back. Too smart. 
$C: > [2 Kea destroying a police car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBdvRCkCNfo) 

Chaotic Good
$C: I hope they are destroying a Kia! 
$C: I love how the one minute mark of the third video, the bird looks at the camera man like "oh what, are you gonna fuckin' narc? Are you a fuckin' rat?"
$C: Why do they go for rubber? Does it have the same texture or smell as something they normally eat?
$C: My cat was entranced by the one of the police car.
$C: Damn, these birds are smarter than I am.
$C: Sure when they do that it‚Äôs considered a sign of intelligence but when I do it I‚Äôm a dumbass
$C: It's like they are going into the crevice searching for food
$C: In Dearf Fortress they are known for breaking into your fort and just streaking fucking everything. I‚Äôm glad to know there is reason for this. 
$C: From the first link:
>It is the first evidence of non-humans using a tool in the country.

We are still waiting for evidence of humans using tools in New Zealand. 
$C: Not to mention delicious!

$C: This is so fantastic, seems like they will go to amazing lengths just to be a dick for no reason.
$C: Thank you for cleaning it up
$C: Classic, they did it to slow you down while taking a shit so they could steal more food later
$C: Came here for DF references, was not disappointed.
$C: Also anvils
$C: I'm glad you shared that video. I mean it gave me a lot more info about these birds than I would have otherwise had, which is always good, but jeez that was hard to watch.
$C: Holy!!! That's amazing but creepy at the same time.

They make such cute noises though. But poor sheep.
$C: Gross I didn't know they did that!
$C: This is a myth

EDIT: I was wrong, Apparently I was a victim of the pro parrot propaganda in the 2000s when I visited NZ. They do eat sheep alive.
$C: Remarkable bird, the Norwegian Blue, idn'it, ay? Beautiful plumage!
$C: I can never not upvote a Monty Pythons reference.
$C: iphone 8, lol
$C: Fun fact - their genus name is *Nestor*, named after the character in [Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestor_(mythology%29) who was renowned for a voice which "flowed sweeter than honey" - hinting at their singing ability
$C: What do you call a flock of Kea?
$C: The [Kaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_kaka) is the other well-known one.
$C: Kee-ah. And the plural of Kea is Kea. 
$C: Welcome to these modern times when planet Earth is relenting to Human pressures 

Just a few 2017 estimates remaining in the wild:

10,000 Blue Whales 

20,000 Polar Bear

20, 000 African Lions

2,500 Bengal Tigers 

5,000 Black Rhinos 

6,600 Cheetah 

15,000 Jaguar 

6,000 Snow Leopards

880 Mountain Gorillas

450 North Atlantic Right Whales 

100 Florida Panthers

300 Wolverine in U.S. 48 states

84 Amur Leopards 

7,000¬†to¬†11,200¬†Gray Wolves in Alaska,¬†

3,700¬†in the Great Lakes region

1,675 in the Northern Rockies

40 Red Wolves

Wolves are extinct in Japan

Wolves in China¬†appear to be decreasing in all their ranges. Currently, Heilongjiang has roughly 650¬†wolves, Xinjiang has 10,000 and Tibet has 2,000.
In 2006, the ¬†Chinese ¬†government began plans to auction licenses to foreigners to hunt wild animals, including¬†wolves. 

Northern White Rhino is extinct in the wild. There are only 2 females left in captivity. With the only male having died earlier this year they are for all purposes completely extinct

-According to the World Resources Institute (WRI), more than¬†80 percent¬†of the Earth's natural forests already have been destroyed at the rate of 20,000 hectares per day 

-The world's largest collection of ocean garbage is growing. The Great¬†Pacific Garbage Patch, a collection of plastic, floating trash halfway between Hawaii and California, has grown to more than 600,000¬†square¬†miles, a study published Thursday found. That's twice the size of Texas. 

There are 4 others; South Pacific, North Atlantic, South Atlantic and Indian Ocean, smaller in size but equal with a density of over 200,000 pieces of debris per square kilometer and where plastic outnumbers zooplankton 6:1

And as far as ravaging the Earth... while eventually man will shift from coal long before it is all used up, sand is a  non renewable finite resource that is rapidly dwindling

From construction to consumer products and beach building to fracking sand, used in "propping open" old wells by injecting thousands of tons per well... industry shows no signs of reducing use, rather is increasing exponentially each year.

[... Sand and gravel are now the most-extracted materials in the world, exceeding fossil fuels and biomass (measured by weight). Sand is a key ingredient for¬†concrete, roads,¬†glass and¬†electronics. Massive amounts of sand are mined for¬†land reclamation projects,¬†shale gas extraction ¬†and¬†beach renourishment programs. 

Recent floods in Houston, India, Nepal and Bangladesh will add to growing global demand for sand.

In 2010, nations mined about 11 billion tonnes of sand¬†just for construction.¬†

Moreover, we have found that these numbers grossly underestimate global sand extraction and use. According to government agencies, uneven record-keeping in many countries¬†may hide real extraction rates. Official statistics widely underreport sand use and typically do not include nonconstruction purposes such as hydraulic fracturing and beach nourishment. ...]

So if you're fixed on having kids, or already do, teach them that by the time they're ready to have kids of their own the world will look nothing like the world in which  we grew up and I am afraid by then will have lost its beauty and grandeur of Nature

My only Solace being I never had any children for merely  the thought of the pain they would endure as they perished would consume me long before any on-rushing Shockwave
$C: No, it's a kea. I've never heard of a bird called a pokemon, do they look similar?
$C: Thanks! I'm not OP but I think I'll post to /r/natureismetal next.
$C: Kee ya
$C: It's pronounced similarly to Kia - it's a MƒÅori word so it's not exact. The correct pronunciation is a bit more abrupt than Kiia, more like Kya.
$C: We English speakers have bastardised Ikea to "eye-kee-ya".
$C: "I-kia" is the English **cough cough BASTARDISED cough** pronunciation, "I-kea" is the Swedish one.

source: horka borka i am is swedish
$C: Key-ah

Say that quickly so it‚Äôs like key yah without hitting the ‚Äòh‚Äô hard
$C: I'd love an AR version, but honestly just a working version with gyroscope controls would be amazing. I'd take either/both in a heartbeat and would gladly pay 5 or 10 bucks if it worked well. 
$C: Thank you! I didn‚Äôt even realize it
$C: I like to think of them more as cats with wings, cheeky fuckers
$C: I think maybe what he meant was "where did OP imply he brought a car?" 
$C: I checked many of them. Thank you for the incredibly helpful reply, but i'm still lost.

Typically "ITT" would imply that a lot of people are talking about how much this bird hates that person's car, but while there are a couple, they're fairly few and far between.
$C: Uhh, I assembled my parrot and I have 2 extra screws. What do?
$C: Tis a fine barn... but tis no parrot 
$C: Your definitely surprised when you find your aerial and windscreen wipers destroyed. 
$C: \+ u/theonebell thank you, these concepts actually make sense to me now
$C: They might be referring to low dispersion lenses? 
$C: Start thinking in "stops", put simply halving/doubling the amount of light getting in. Say your exposure starts off at f8, 1/125th of a second, iso 400. You want the back ground to be more in focus as well as the closer subject so you need to close that aperture down, 1 stop down would be to f11 which halves the light getting in, meaning you need to either - double the length of the shutter speed to 1/60th seconds, or double  your iso  (sensor sensitivity) to 800. Slowing down the shutter speed could mean a blurry photo so be you need to avoid camera shake with steady hands, a tripod or stabilised lenses. Boosting the iso reduces image quality, increasing noise and decreasing sharpness, but most modern dslrs should be fine up to iso800. Hope this helps!
$C: I'm not a photography expert but chances are that your DSLR is still pretty good, they have large sensors and what makes a big difference anyway are the lenses you put on it. Good lenses can be just as expensive if not many times the price of the camera body.

The sensor on phones is pretty small but they've been getting really good at using post-processing to make pictures really nice thanks to their powerful processor and everything else.
$C: Absolutely not. The iPhone is amazing at bright light photography, especially outdoors. The colours are great, and the shutter is fast. But it‚Äôs still incredibly limited. It‚Äôs good at this kind of shot. And that‚Äôs about it. 
$C: Isn‚Äôt New Zealand the only place they can use rat/rodent poison without worrying about hurting wild animals because there are no native mammals there?
$C: Ah, then my explanation is not adequate... I just love wide angle lenses :(
$C: In awe at the size of this lad.
$C: That....that looks like a massive pigeon. A MASSIVE PIGEON.

$C: Arent phones nowadays like 12 megapixel?  Its amazing that that isnt considered high quality anymore.
$C: *Kea are the world's only alpine parrot, and one of only three parrot species still to exist in New Zealand. Each of the three species of parrots in New Zealand have evolved to fill different niches so not to compete with each other -the Kea is an alpine parrot, the Kakapo is flightless and nocturnal, and the Kaka fills much the same role as you'd expect from any normal parrot*
$C: Local methhead. 
$C: Me too. Saw his comment and breathed in sweet, sweet relief.
$C: ooooh
$C: oh they know... 
$C: Oh, no, I just missed that...
$C: Yes our Total of 4 and a bit million is much easier to hassle in to helping.
$C: Haha gonna guess you didn‚Äôt watch the game on the weekend? But yeah it can be pretty boring here. Probably not as much going on as where you live 
$C: Oh yeah .. way cooler. Now I understand.
$C: I would say he doesnt need to cause it's his piece of art.
$C: Also, a massive asshole. But that‚Äôs beside the point here. 
$C: Those bastards eat my car up every time I go snowboarding. They'll eat/destroy anything for fun!
$C: Endangered species, and that particular one looks a lot better than those in the pics [here](http://nzbirdsonline.org.nz/species/kea).
$C: Ikea? That's where I bought a bunch of my furniture. 
$C: must be a giant one
$C: u/RedBanana99 asked for the name of the bird, not a car brand. 
$C: Thanks. Was going to ask the same question. 
$C: Looks more like a Hyundai
$C: A parrot.
$C: Liar, that's clearly a Phoenix.
$C: Except when they eat your car tires or mirrors....
$C: Are you sure it's not Dyna Blade?
$C: They also exist in Sweden but there they are called iKea. 


No, I‚Äôm not proud. üòû
$C: i would never have imagined that keas looked like this with their wings out! amazing!!!
$C: Close, but it's actually a Hyundai.
$C: Even stole a very distinctive part of the title, the liar should be on r/stupidcriminals
$C: I don't think that'd be enough. Timestamps are usually based on local time, and Apple backup's timestamp I'm guessing isn't much more definitive than that.

Unless you are the only one that has an original full resolution uncropped version, I'd be surprised if anything else would hold up if fighting for rights.

The photo that was used as Windows XP's default background was supposedly bought for something in the "low six figures" (never confirmed due to an NDA).

So yes, if you are potentially sitting on a $100k photo, I think you'd agree that distorting it to protect your windfall would be worth it.
$C: ITT:  Two opinions on the priority of monetizing a picture 
$C: Since he mentioned he shot it with his iPhone, I can already see this as one of those "Shot on iPhone" ads you see everywhere. Stunning shot could be worth a lot to the right buyer.

Apple jump on this! You need the money.
$C: And it's Soderbergh! I didn't know that. I remember Tangerine was also shot on an iPhone a couple of years ago, but it was a more indie production.
$C: Yep
$C: Fithing... is what Mike Tyson does to relax during the summer 
$C: Fifthing because I'm an alcoholic. 
$C: Fifthing, because I like the sound of it.
$C: Fifthing just for the thrill of it 
$C: [Rule of thirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds?wprov=sfla1)
$C: Sounds like my cats
$C: Yeah feeding them makes them more likely to eat the poisons intended for possums, stoats and rats
$C: [removed]
$C: Yup. Our forebears were incredibly good at that. Also eating newly discovered animals to extinction. 
$C: Isn‚Äôt New Zealand the only place they can use rat/rodent poison without worrying about hurting wild animals because there are no native mammals there?
$C: The Keas don‚Äôt help their own cause by basically being super smart, inquisitive cheeky FUCKHEADS. 
$C: Humans putting a bounty on their heads -due to Kea getting a liking to the fat around sheep kidneys- didn't help either.
$C: Not only that but for about 100 years the New Zealand government has bounties out on kea bills because they were preying on livestock. About 150,000 were killed during this time.
$C: Actually, all 3 are the same mountain. It goes right through.
$C: Nope. Human-introduced rodents have mercilessly feasted on their eggs and nestlings, decimating their numbers. 
$C: Not a lot support birb populations these days
$C: Hobart here. You've inspired me to make the trip. 
$C: IDK about 'pretty much all'. Not to minimize on a serious problem but the common birds like fantail and wood pigeon are doing aight
$C: I‚Äôm pretty versed in hiking and climbing but was pretty surprised at how unprepared a lot of people seemed for that hike. Even more so when we did Tongarura Pass on the North Island. It‚Äôs a 12 mile hike if you only go one way  and it was raining and cold when we did it. Sure enough, people in t-shirts and jeans with a single water bottle were setting out for a day-long 12 mile trek! What are you thinking!
$C: It wasn‚Äôt THAT bad. Not icy and nothing was sticking. I‚Äôve done a fair amount of hiking and climbing so I set myself a turnback time in case the weather didn‚Äôt let up. The peak was well worth the climb though. 
$C: You‚Äôre hanging in the wrong Lemond, friend. 
$C: I was tramping the Routeburn track a couple of years ago, and woke up early because a couple of keas were sliding down the roof, down to the bottom, flap up to the top, repeat. Sharp claws, dragging on corrugated iron, made a lovely noise, like fingernails on a chalkboard.

So when I got outside, I found that they had been playing with everyone's hiking boots. Everyone (about 20 people in the hut) had left them outside to air and dry out, and the birds had been dragging them around by the laces, and chewing the plastic ends off the laces. Found one boot about 30 meters away dragged under some trees.

So after I'd collected all of those up and put them inside where the birds couldn't get at them any more, they came down from the roof where they'd been watching me and complaining to each other about me spoiling their fun and they found an empty gas cylinder canister (from a gas cooker) and started pushing that around on the benchtop. then it fell on the concrete floor and they played football with it for about 20 minutes, banging and clattering across the concrete.

Good fun !
$C: Whenever they're being shooed away from the destruction they're bringing on something valuable, they have an almost Daffy Duck like hop to go with the cute little noises. Almost like they know they're being mischievous and pissing off the stupid shaved apes. 

"Hehe! Whatdya gonna do about Stoopid hooman!?... He!... He!... He!..."
$C: For a certain percentage of people. Congratulations, you may be a crazy bird person :] Do you also think baby birds are cute? That's a warning sign.

Have to go, there's a parrot on my shoulder that wants scratches.
$C: You should also see this.

EDIT: I was wrong, Apparently I was a victim of the pro parrot propaganda in the 2000s when I visited NZ. They do eat sheep alive.
$C: Apparently they like the fat around the kidneys. 
$C: Hopefully your coworkers don't go around ripping rubber and aerials off cars
$C: [Keas moving road cones in Homer tunnel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4FT0xnFJC0)
$C: I heard this same story from the bus driver taking us to Milford Sound! They are so smart.
$C: Just a tad of an exaggeration that they "destroy" a police car though...
$C: I think its the texture, they can easily hook that sharp beak and claws into it and rip holes in it. But they'll do the same to anything they can get their beak and claws into. Rolls of toilet paper, plastic balls, sheep....
$C: They just like to "play" with things and as a result are somewhat destructive.

If there's one animal that needs toys, it's a kea.
$C: It's mainly because all the tools are in Australia
$C: thats a little harsh...
$C: They‚Äôre assholes. Neat ones though!
$C: I'll wager this Kea here sensed the OPs karma and posed that shot for him
$C: Appreciate the concern for nature, but toilet paper is biodegradable and is no more harmful than tree bark to any wild animals.
$C: You are wrong.  
There is a video in their comment, and it's been documented by NatGeo, DOC and independent conservation groups who have no interest in perpetuating a myth or a hoax that reflects badly on Kea. 

$C: Your existence is a myth
$C: Seriously!? Sheeeit üòÇ Good pic my dude. 1 in a million shot right there. 
$C: Its great for subject photos, but terrible at landscapes

Take a look at this link,

Vowels in Maori are pronounced differently. For instance the I is said EE.

$C: It was such a missed opportunity for the Wii U- that set up was perfect. 
$C: It was yesterday. Sorry friend. 
$C: Keas are like flying monkeys. Very smart and mischievous. Its fairly common to see tourists sitting in their cars in the southern Alps while keas will land on their car. The tourist will start taking pictures and then the keas will rip off the rubber linings, car aerials and window wipers till you go away or give them food. They know what they're doing
$C: For a New Zealand Kea I'm afraid you have to take them to Mount Doom.  It's the only way to be sure.
$C: Save for future usage when the next parrot is 2 short screws because you bet your arse some parrot out there is unassembled in a flat box somewhere with two screws short 
$C: Wait ten years, then the front falls off.
$C: Yah that's a good point, I feel like difference between FStop and TStop isn't even really considered by most photographers anyway though.
$C: That helps a lot, thanks! I'm gonna print this and take it with me as I practice with the manual settings üòÄ
$C: Autofocus on older DSLR is dogshit compared to the latest models, though. I say this as an amateur bird photographer. Auto focus for bird-in-flight photos is super important and it is a hard thing to get right, especially when you are normally using a big ass lens. For OP to take a photo like this of a Kea with a fucking iPhone is amazing. 
$C: And glass lenses
$C: Yeah, it's become a bit of a controversy in recent times due to social media conspiracy theory fuckery though. Also we do have a couple of species of native bats, but they shouldn't eat the baits.

The poison (1080) is for now pretty much the only way we can do pest control in remote regions and keep these native birds alive.
$C: Absolute unit.
$C: yep, that pretty much sums it up.

not on the menu tho, don't have that many left.
$C: Also known as the NZ Wood Pigeon, correct.
$C: Won...
$C: Ah yes. It is!

Sad they're not native. They ran along the path when I visited Zealandia a few years ago.

I did meet an odd, brown fuzzy thing once however! At a roadside picnick area near some waterfalls, Kinda like a Kiwi but taller. It was curious, then sneezed and scared itself.

$C: Dude.. Ireland has played the all blacks 31 times. They won twice.

All the top teams can beat the all blacks on a good day. Especially playing at home.

All blacks are still the top ranked team in the world. 

One win loss, does not mandate which is the better team overall.

South Africa also beat the all blacks this year. And they are struggling right now.

Smart money (without odds) is still on the all blacks for wc win.

I mean Ireland is doing well right now. But historically the best teams are South Africa and New Zealand. But it‚Äôs clearly the all blacks who are the best, then and now by some margin. ;)

All blacks will get those northerners back.

But yeah, Ireland did earn the no.2 spot in world rankings fair and square. Will have to beat the all blacks again for the no.1.. still haven‚Äôt convinced me.
$C: Is it his art or his photo? Or is it his photo that is also art?

Hey I'm glad it's art and agree that it is so, and beautiful. I just don't agree a thing is a photograph if it's an edited photograph necessarily (depends if the editing is to restore or to 'enhance'). A photo can be a documentation of reality. A piece of art can be that or something added.

I've not seen anyone else that feels this way and I'm baffled by it. If the artist is upfront about making art then there is no dream to be spoiled.

If I take a picture of you and change your race, gender, species, expression, etc.., at what point would you consider it not a photograph of you but an interpretation? Personally I wouldn't insist you call it a photograph of you, but I guess I'm weird?

$C: Because of New Zealand's isolated nature, birds evolved to fill the niches that mammals do elsewhere in the world.  The Kea does the same thing as the shady dude who offers to watch your car for $5 because 'it's a bad part of town.'
$C: great for removing windscreen wipers and antennas
$C: Am legit shocked that he was flying and not in the car park tearing the rubber off OPs car. 
$C: So your version of the geese gang I got hanging in the park outside my apartment.
$C: These things are NZ's answer to the cockatoo, cheeky little buggers
$C: Yeah watch out for ya window wipers and door lining when you go for a hike! Hahaha
$C: Scrolled up to check the picture because I didn't even notice the asshole, never mind thinking of it as massive.

ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
$C: > Also, a massive asshole.

Ya, he photo bombed what would have been a great shot of the mountains.
$C: I‚Äôve never seen the size of its asshole, but judging by the size of its shit, it must be pretty big. 
$C: Man you just got to know the tricks felt a can of tuna or what ever tie it in the tree when you arrive low enough for them to get at, it will keep them occupied for hours and will leave your car alone.
$C: But that's neither here nor there
$C: HIS NAME IS WARREZ! HES AN ASSHOLE!
$C: 2 of them blatantly stole my lunch while hiking in Arthurs Pass. dicks. when i tried to stop them they looked at me like U wot m8?
$C: ...only because we, as humans, resent the Keas relative intelligence to ours. They really are some industrious birds! 
$C: Actually, you're description of that bird is spot on :)
$C: Compared to humans they seeM alright.
$C: I was wondering how a bird can "eat" a car before I saw the other linked pic with its beak in frame.
$C: Dude, just chuck some trail mix, nuts and anything long and shiny into a coke bottle, close the lid, melt it and stab some small holes in the bottle with a pencil or a screwdriver.   
Leave it by your car and they'll go for it instead of your car everytime.   


As you said, they just want some fun. If you give em a new toy to play with instead of the 100th car this week they'll be more than happy. The only thing is if you keep coming back to the same spot you'll need to make the toy more complicated.
$C: Yep. They're a mountain parrot that mostly lives on the ground, so they evolved to be camouflaged when they're hiding in amongst the rocks - hence all of their 'outer' plumage is drab olive greens and browns. But they're still a parrot; they just wear their fabulous rainbow cloaks on the inside. 

Interestingly, since New Zealand doesn't have any native mammals beyond a few bats, their only natural predators would have been [Haast's eagles and ~~giant moa~~ our other native predatory birds](https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/hires/moa.jpg) - the eagles had a ten foot wingspan, the moa that they preyed on grew up to twelve feet tall.

Of course, humans ruin everything, and in the last 500 years they've had to share the countryside with rats, stoats, ferrets, possums, goats, pigs, cats and dogs. Which is why there are less than 7000 of them left in the wild. :(
$C: Yawn. Kakapo or bust. 
$C: after reading all the shit they do I'm not surprised they're endangered lol
$C: Anyone catch liars username?
$C: You say that but I honestly find it more profitable to put high res bait out there and reverse image search my future defendants
$C: Well, there‚Äôs this reddit thread: the first appearance online that‚Äôs also full of discussions about it being an original, and OP can prove it‚Äôs their account.  
$C: Fishing is so wholesome. My mind went straight to fist...

$C: Sixthing because everything is better with six 
$C: Sounds like my dads
$C: k
$C: Worst novelty account?
$C: But actually it is bad for the birds cause it makes them dependant on humans for food... so, kindly, don‚Äôt feed the birds mmmmmk?
$C: Wat.... Ahh fack take my upboat
$C: Chill Hannibal lector.
$C: RIP the dodo
$C: Honestly, that's better than what the white settlers did to the American bison. They came through and slaughtered the shit out of the bison in order to take away native people's food source. Fuckers. 
$C: Or just killing them for the fun of it. That's what happened to the passenger pigeon. You could walk up to a flock that was sitting on the ground and stomp them all to death because they wouldn't flee.


And so we killed them all.
$C: Pretty much yeah. There's currently a big backlash against it though. Conspiracy theories that it's killing native birds when in fact there's never been any evidence of it and the bait programs are working well. They've had people turning up at parliament with dead birds claiming they were poisoned only to find it was clearly blunt force trauma. 

It's pretty much just pushed by arseholes that want to their hunting dogs free in the bush to kill everything without risk of them eating the poison. Thankfully nobody listens to them. 

Edit: "never been any evidence of it" was slightly hyperbolic of me. The threat to native birds is negligible. 
https://predatorfreenz.org/bird-kill-research-reveals/ 
It's an interesting read with a journal link at the bottom. 
$C: Only native mammals are bats but for obvious reasons they probably don't go along the ground like rats do. 
$C: Wow I didn‚Äôt realize that. It‚Äôs sad to see any animals wiped out like that, especially ones that have such a high intelligence. 
$C: Absolutely! You can fly to Queenstown direct from Melbourne (or Syd/Bris). If you're a fit male under 40 you could be checked into a hotel and on the summit 4 hours after landing. It really is phenomenally close to the town centre.

November to February is best for weather.

Here's the first short YouTube clip I could find of the view. Its a bit shit but gives you the idea.

https://youtu.be/EfXmile3VB4
$C: And I suppose since they are much more common, they do make up most of the native birds... 
$C: Everyone else turned back so I‚Äôm guessing novices would be advised to turn back also?
$C: That sounds like quite the noisy situation. 
$C: > the plastic ends off the laces

Random fact: These are called aglets.
$C: I was up there many years ago. It rained and thundered for two days and nobody left the hut. In the morning the keas would be drinking the water running off the metal roof. On the third day it snowed. The keas were up there trying to figure out why the water wasn't running off anymore and getting very uptight about it.
$C: Best camping buddy to keep you busy a while

$C: > For OP to take a photo like this of a Kea with a fucking iPhone is amazing.

Not to downplay OP's photo at all (I think it's incredible), but iPhones have such a massive DoF owing to the small sensor that it's not overly difficult to get an image in focus.
$C: My sky
$C: r/AbsoluteUnits
$C: Username checks out
$C: Aw, weka. Cute, yeah, but those sneaky bastards are like flightless magpies - they'll steal anything shiny they can carry. One got into my van when I was staying near the [Cobb River](https://www.rankers.co.nz/experiences/5280-Cobb_River_Campsite) and then it panicked, clawed everything, shat everywhere, and refused to leave. Took me ages to get the poor terrified thing out, and it didn't learn at all. Came right back to steal my pot-scrub. 
$C: *The genus name of the Kea (and KƒÅkƒÅ) is Nestor, so named after the character in Greek mythology who was said to have had a voice which "flowed sweeter than honey" - giving some indication as to their singing ability!*
$C: *Kea are incredibly intelligent - many manmade objects within the Kea's habitat rely on sheer weight to be tamper-proof, as even complex logic puzzles tough to humans prove no match for the wily birds*
$C: Chur bro
$C: fuark what a skux kieeent
$C: This is what I came for.
$C: He does look like a cheeky cunt 
$C: I'm American but that's my preferred description as well. Probably has something to do with my cockney business partner though...

$C: And bananas out of children's hands haha 
$C: [and window trim](https://vgy.me/Kgzfv8.jpg)  

$C: They have been known to team up, with one distracting tourists and drawing them away from their car while others swoop in to steal/dismantle things. Possibly this one was posing for the photo while its friends pulled the heist.
$C: He was the designated decoy while all his kea friends trashed OPs car
$C: It‚Äôs the Chuck Norris of birds!!!
$C: More the answer to Rainbow Lorikeets (Who I have legit seen mob and beat up a cockatoo who got too close.)
$C: Samesies. Was disappointed 
$C: Could only have turned out better if there was a massive stream of bird turd squirting out its cloaca 
$C: Moa were herbivores ;)
Also, kea are preyed upon by karearea, our native falcon. I witnessed an amazing aerial fight between a kea and karearea once. 
$C: The Maori killed off the Moa, which killed off the Haast's. Even the hunter/gatherers were jerks. Man, New Zealand would have been absolutely amazing to see like 1000 years ago, with the flightless birds (or any island with the friendly, slow or flightless birds we killed off). 
$C: Plus the government paid a reward for each kea killed. They actually tried to exterminate them. Reckoned they attacked sheep, which they did, but it isn't an issue these days. 
$C: Im pretty sure the giant moa is presumed extinct right? Ive heard of sightings but no concrete evidence really.
$C: I believe Kea ate Moa. Or at least Moa kidneys. Which is why today's Kea eat sheep kidneys. 
$C: Only works if you have definitive proof. ;)

$C: Also the Carolina Parakeet. 
$C: Shot them from their train cars, left the skinned carcasses rotting on the plains, stacked the skulls in pyramid piles 40 feet high

The native peoples looked on in horror and disbelief at the wanton waste of their gods' precious gift
$C: That sucks too, obviously. Neither is "better," it's all horrific. 
$C: Makes me sick. 
$C: I wouldn't call it a big backlash. It's a vocal minority of nutters - think anti-vaxers and you'll get the idea.
$C: I'm also a propenent of using 1080 but what you're saying isn't correct. There is a bykill of native birds and in the past the distribution of poisoned bait was horribly mismanaged, and the bykill was quite bad. However DOC have learned from past mistakes and now the benefits of 1080 drops far outweigh the negatives.

$C: > Pretty much yeah. There's currently a big backlash against it though. Conspiracy theories that it's killing native birds when in fact there's never been any evidence of it and the bait programs are working well.

I find that very hard to believe unless there are no raptors or other things that would opportunistically eat mammals.
$C: What happens if you're a 42 year old woman? Do I get banished? I guess I'll wait for my next life, ugh, as always. ;)

$C: Most parrots and exotic birds are very loud. Both in vocals and in play.

$C: How do you know? Are you Al Bundy?
$C: Enjoy it ! (and make sure that you are booked in well in advance, because those huts book out really fast, unless you are tenting)

Main thing to remember is that, even though Feb is mid summer, Routeburn (and Milford and Kepler) are alpine tracks, and NZ has a reputation for having very changeable weather, ***especially*** in alpine environments. So even if the weather forecast shows good weather, you still need to carry a decent raincoat, and long-sleeved polyprop/merino layers, and extra socks, and decent footwear, because the weather can change from warm and sunny to cold, rain and freezing over 2-3 hours. Most of the time in summer you won't need any of that, but sometimes you do, and you're awfully exposed along parts of those tracks.

3 years ago I walked the Kepler (which is in the same area as the Routeburn) in late November, (so late Spring). It was warm and sunny when we left Te Anau, 3 hours later we came out of the treeline near Luxmore hut into a howling blizzard, snow and winds of 70+km, and much worse higher up. Snow was 20 cm (7 in) deep on the ground when we reached the hut, and mid calf deep the next morning. So they closed the track (and Routeburn and Milford) and sent everyone back down again.

So don't totally trust the weather forecasts, prepare for the weather to turn to shit, then hope that it doesn't.

But its amazing country, so have a great time ! and don't feed the keas  :-)

$C:  Imagine the size of a moa drumstick... jesus
$C: Humans changed the game for megafauna because even with crude weapons, groups humans where insanely effective at killing large animals that relied upon their size for safety. This is the same story as for most other large species, if they where herbivores we killed them all and if they where predators we killed off their food source.

Thanks. 
$C: Hell yeah thanks for the advice! Wanted to do Kepler too but the campsites for the dates I coul to we‚Äôre already booked up, but I managed to get the routeburn falls lodge and a Mackenzie lake campsite! I was gonna hitchhike at the end to Te Anau where my parents will happen to be that week too. A week or so before routeburn I‚Äôm going to do the Gillespie pass circuit where the lodges are first come first serve. Gonna spend 5 days tramping and fly fishing the Wilkins and young rivers. After Te Anau i was either gonna take a bus or hitchhike up north to Nelson and possibly do Abel Tasman. Do you think hitchhiking will work?
$C: [removed]
$C: So if you're taking a picture of like, them, they'd be 'themies'? Sorryful I am new to internet 
$C: Inside or outside?

Did they end up out of focus or just blurry due to movement? Those are very different things.
$C: *Kea are found exclusively on the South Island of New Zealand (Te Wai Pounamu). Most of this is within the Southern Alps, though various smaller pockets exist in the Kaikoura mountain ranges, Nelson / Tasman area and Fiordland.* 
$C: Legeeeend
$C: They expertly and deliberately disassemble stuff. Notoriously mischievous and inquisitive. One of the smartest birds in the world, and the world‚Äôs only alpine parrot.
$C: If a Kea is in your way on the road, you stop your car and wait for it to move. 

They are super endangered and we need to protect the species.
$C: NZ's endemic wildlife commonly has drab colouration (Especially when viewed from above) as raptors, the only endemic predators, hunt by sight.

Then mammals who hunt by scent turn up with is very bad news for kakapo and kiwi alike with their distinctive smells. 
$C: That's why they are extinct.
$C: Agreed. There's a CHANCE the moa is still out there, at least I hope.
$C: Fair point
$C: Well, it‚Äôs at least hole some.
$C: I‚Äôm joining this thread now
$C: Totally fulfilling.
$C: It's the whole fist and-then-some.
$C: Ninthing? 
$C: Ninthing to keep this train going.
$C: Right, but are there things that would opportunistically eat the mammals?  For instance the Wikipedia article on the white-bellied sea eagle has this to say:

> The white-bellied sea eagle hunts mainly aquatic animals, such as fish, turtles and sea snakes, but it takes birds, such as little penguins, Eurasian coots and shearwaters, and mammals (including flying foxes) as well.

And this about the swap harrier:

> The swamp harrier mainly feeds on ground birds and waterbirds, rabbits and other small mammals, reptiles, frogs, and fish. During the winter months harriers feed to a large extent on carrion, including roadkill, frequently falling victim to vehicles themselves. 

So, sure, there are no native mammals but other things higher up the food chain like raptors WILL opportunistically eat mammals.  If you leave dead rodents full of blood thinners you WILL poison the things that eat them such as the native birds of prey.
$C: Damn! That's a bit depressing to know. I used to work with guys who would get annoyed when they were expected to do more physically demanding work just because they were guys even if they were skinny or short. I didn't think testosterone made such a difference unless you were going hard at powerlifting or whatever. 

Thanks for the insight, and I am definitely going to go to there one day. New Zealand and I have unfinished business. One of the most beautiful places in the world. 
$C: Sorry - I misread your comment. It was one of those mountain storms that starts blowing sleet and a little snow around but you can see the end of it in the distance. It wasn't going to be dangerous. The big difference was that I had the proper layers and amount of water for a decent hike. A lot of people were in blue jeans and t shirts with half a bottle of water. 

PS - I loved your country. The people were amazing, the scenery and being outdoors was unbelievable. Everyone was so hospitable and kind. It was the  best trip I've ever been on and I cannot wait to come back.
$C: Hitching back to Te Anau off the Routeburn - depends which end you are at. If you finish on the Milford end, then hitchhiking should be easy due to all the Milford traffic. The other end is much less traveled, although there are periodic shuttles dropping people off and picking them up. they usually expect payment though.

Hitchhiking should work OK, depends which way you want to go, via Wanaka and the West Coast, or Wanaka-Twizel-Hamner-Lewis Pass and up to Nelson, or Wanaka-Christchurch-Blenheim and Nelson.

All of them can work, there will still be lots of people holidaying on the roads (primary schools will be starting back, high schools and University are a bit later), and there are usually buses running all 3 routes as well, although the bus route through Lewis Pass will almost certainly go via Chch
$C: Because those things attract lots of bacteria / pests. TP won't.
$C: and here I thought NZ peaked at the kiwis
$C: I heard the also had a spree of eating sheep while they were still alive so farmers kill them as pests back before 5ey were protected 
$C: I am surprised how tame they are, we hiked right pass a few of them chilling on the trail and they didn't even bother to move.
$C: yep.. and their habit of living in burrows. NOT SMART GUYS
$C: Would be awesome, but sadly it would be hard for them to hide, even smaller species, and even in Fiordland or the depths of the Urewera ranges.. 
$C: No there's not, not really. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Fists fit some holes

$C: 4 day late tenthing!

$C: True enough but we've only got like 4 birds of prey species and only two of them eats anything larger than mice
$C: For something like Ben Lomond, a 1700m peak, that's a whole lot of metres to lift your entire body. Testosterone vastly increases hemoglobin production, which carries oxygen in the blood, which dictates your physical capacity on every level. I would imagine vertical climbing times would have one of the bigger gender differences. 

I was a serious (top 4%) marathon runner pre-HRT. Due to a drop in hemoglobin I effectively lost 5 years of cardio gains in 5 weeks of testosterone blockers, pretty soul destroying stuff. Testosterone also gives far superior muscle recovery... I'd say my recovery time has tripled (and my upper-body strength has dropped 40%) meaning I can no longer work any labouring jobs. Basically think of all the effects of anabolic steroids, and men genetically have that advantage over women.

The South Island of NZ is amazing, I recommend people skip the North Island altogether.
$C: Ka kite ano! We‚Äôll see you again :)
$C: I end up on the Milford side. If I were to hitchhike up to Nelson from QT what would be your favorite route to go?
$C: Tourists leave tp all throughout our walking tracks. And not all brands break down as easy as others; many pollute waterways.

No one wants to clean it up, because they don't know where its been.

As a general rule leave the campground better than how you found it. Don't litter at all. 
$C: Nah bro, they peaked at the Moa.
$C: Kiwis are definitely a trough for NZ
$C: I don't think they ever learned to fear humans. 
It's not humans they need to be worried about so much either, it's the introduced pests (rats, stoats, etc) that are causing them to slowly work their way to extinction. üòî
$C: A lot of NZ birds aren't too scared of people because most evolved with no natural predators. Like weka for example will just walk up to you looking for food. I've had some in my tent before stealing bread, and hunting them would be as easy as just picking one off the ground. 
Also the other day I made friends with a pukeko and it let me pat it. They're cool as but either really stupid or really trusting 
$C: Well there was a sighting in i think 2013 that was pretty legit. Ill see if i can find the link. I mean it wasn't conclusive but idk what else ostrich looking bird wise could of been that big. 
$C: Eh, there's a lot of *deep* bush in the South Island (and even in Hawkes Bay, where a pig hunter got lost and stumbled on a crashed Tigermoth in the 70s and nobody else has ever been able to find it.)

There are probably small areas that haven't seen humans in decades. It's pretty hard to rule what does or doesn't live there, and anything that is there is probably thriving on the lack of human presence.
$C: No as in, that's a hole and then some
$C: That is: in some Ass hole.
$C: If it fits, I fist.

$C: > True enough but we've only got like 4 birds of prey species and only two of them eats anything larger than mice

Ah, eh, what?  We're talking about rodent poison here.  So anything that would eat poisoned mice is at rick.

http://nzbirdsonline.org.nz/group-search?field_search_genus_name_value=Raptors&field_search_family_name_value=Raptors&field_search_other_groups_value=Raptors

The internet suggests that all the living native NZ raptors eat small mammals including:  The New Zealand Falcon, Morepork, Barn Owl, and the non-native Little Owl.  I suspect you're making a bit of a needless distinction.  Most carnivores aren't that picky.  If I had to go out on a limb I'd guess that blood thinners (a.k.a. rat poison) are bad for reptiles and fish as well.  Although I suspect most fish won't be eating poisoned rodents I bet reptiles would if given the chance.
$C: Heh, all these people talking about Aotearoa like we have anything other than birds...
$C: Again, cheers. It's not relevant to the sub, but your experience of HRT is really interesting and I hope you're enjoying more payoffs than losses.  

I loved South Island! We were going to the Marlborough Wine Festival in 2008 when there was an ecoli breakout in the water. Decided to flag that off (our friends had a baby in tow) and went to Kaikoura. It felt like home (granted it was a bit like my Aussie hometown with snow and more seals). I can't wait to go back, and see the rest of the South Island gems. I did love Wellington though... The houses and Waiheke and Te Papa.. Ugh, it's all good. 
$C: Probably over the Haast pass, up the West Coast to Greymouth, then inland through Reefton, Murchison to Nelson.

Its a fairly well traveled route, takes you past a couple of glacier, and is a nice scenic trip. Only challenge is that the West Coast has a reputation  for raining on a regular basis
$C: The Haast eagle wants a word
$C: Jesus what a drumstick those buggers would‚Äôve produced. 

Edit: and omelettes! 
$C: I've always thought it would be awesome if they did find one but after going to fiordland I thought they'd have to be so fucking stealth to never get spotted ever
$C: Not some A hole?
