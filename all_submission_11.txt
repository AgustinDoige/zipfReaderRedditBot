These damn ads are what did it!

$C: Click to download!^^*

^^*McAfee ^^premium ^^with ^^complimentary ^^hourly ^^popups
$C: Do ads do this on purpose? Do websites sell the space right next to frequently used buttons as a way of getting the unexpected movement clicks?
$C: Missile Warning System isn't going to pay for itself, gotta get that ad revenue.
$C: Original post /u/gpmcadam
$C: For what it's worth the real Hawaii Alert menu isn't much better:

$C: Everybody knows, if you press the red button, somebody comes in and brings you a Coke.
$C: Ugh story of my life!
$C: Google search does this to me now. Whenever I search on google, the results show up for about 1.5 seconds, and then BOOM, it shoves the results down and throws in a bunch of "sponsored" links. I always end up clicking on one by accident. So frustrating.
$C: Computers should have an option to ignore clicks on objects that have been visible for less than e.g. 400 ms, or whatever value surpasses the individuals response time to visual stimuli sufficiently.   

That should prevent unintentional clicks in most cases. One would have to test the concept for side effects and refine it though, and add the ability to blacklist/whitelist applications.


**Edit:**  
If you wonder what your response time is, you can test it on [this website](https://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime/) to get a feeling for what a few hundred milliseconds mean. The 400 ms example was just a value that's obviously higher than the average and median of 200-300ms to make the concept clear.

$C: Looking at you Solarmovies 
$C: I'm disappointed in you, u/guyi568. I thought better of you. Reposting? At your age? What does you mother think of this? Does she know?

I'm not calling the police this time. You get one shot. Don't screw it up, kid.
$C: No ad blocker? Noobs  
$C: Every... Single... Time.
$C: And this is why I now wait like 30 seconds before clicking anything like this... 
$C: Can you imagine how much faster the web would be if Google and other marketers didn't decide which ads to throw in your face?
$C: The most infuriating thing on mobile... and the worst part is that it seems to fucking wait until you click it. I'll give it some time to load, then when nothing is happening, and I think it's safe to click... surprise muthafucka!
$C: Bit of a TIFU incident.. hear me out..

Look, I never thought this would blow up, I found this on a comment on a different post of mine [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7qrom8/japan_broadcaster_sends_false_north_korea_missile/dsrfxpz/?st=jchxm7ds&sh=f1bbbac2), I didnt even know this was posted on someother subreddit, I checked Karma Decay, showed nothing, so I just thought why not post it to /r/funny cuz its suits the style, only later I found it it blew up on another sub, and I gave credit to the guy in another comment (he got triple gilded in his post). Idk what to do now, I dont get why the mods havent deleted it yet, my bad.
$C: Gotta get those clicks somehow 
$C: Should have paid the 99 cents for the ad free version. 
$C: Accurate
$C: Looks accurate
$C: Jesus Christ. The repost is strong. Was on /r/programminghumor hours before


E:programmerhumor*
$C: r/programmerhumor
$C: This was posted 5 hours earlier by another user /u/gpmcadam on /r/ProgrammerHumor, which is likely the original creator as these are a thing we make on that subreddit.

https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/7qrej8/real_screenshot_from_hawaii_warning_system_actual/
$C: This right here is the reason I switched to Opera. Not sending missiles, clicking wrong shit.
$C: I‚Äôm on 3G and this is the only things that‚Äôs showing up, send help
$C: There should be a mass strike against internet companies that:

* Include non-ad javascript popups to register or like
* Stick top navigation/brand bars over the top that shift the page when you scroll 1 page down
* Have these asychronous loading click traps instead of premeasuring the ad space
* Autostart videos
* Have video-only news
* Interfere with browser navigation like forward and back

Reddit needs to create an official blacklist to load into the Adblockers and Noscript

Maybe even a whitelist to reward reputable sites with ad generation
$C: This happened to me a couple days ago when I was trying to purchase the movie IT, but it switched to battle of the sexes


$C: Actually seems pretty accurate.
$C: That little nervous mouse shake was perfect. I can hear it, "*no, no, no!*"
$C: Then they had to reboot the PC, but Windows 10 decided to download updates for 38 minutes
$C: Lmao the mouse shake after was brilliant
$C: I like that little shake of the mouse in frustration/panic , I know I've done it. 
$C: Should have been running r/pihole
$C: This made me laugh harder than it should have.
$C: That hits SO close to home! I have like 400 flash updates in my downloads when all I was trying to do is get an mp3 of a fucking youtube video....

$C: This is the most relatable thing I‚Äôve seen in a long time.
$C: Stolen from programmer humour but ill allow it for exposure lol
$C: That will teach them to use the unpaid version.

Now they will have to pay to have the adds removed...
$C: r/facts
$C: Now that is funny.
$C: Because the tax revenue is soooooo low that the EMA needs to rely on Ads to Run. üíÄ
$C: You know, I thought it was bullshit that it was as simple as someone pressing the wrong button, but I'll be damned, I wouldn't be surprised at all if this is what really happened.  This is the world we live in, folks.
$C: Man I fucking hate when ads do that. I swear they've designed them to make you accidentally click on the stupid ad. 
$C: you just blatantly reposted somone else post like an hour later after it already reached the front page.
$C: Man even this post gives me anxiety lol.
$C: Holy shit, you literally just stole this from /r/ProgrammerHumor you piece of shit.
$C: Why are people gilding this? This was from another subreddit, a post by /u/gpmcadam, before i get destroyed, let me explain..

Look, i never thought this would blow up, I found the gif on a comment on a different post of mine [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7qrom8/japan_broadcaster_sends_false_north_korea_missile/dsrfxpz/?st=jchxm7ds&sh=f1bbbac2), I didnt even know this was posted on someother subreddit, I checked Karma Decay, showed nothing, so I just thought why not post it to /r/funny cuz its suits the style, only later I found it it blew up on another sub, and I gave credit to the guy in another comment (he got triple gilded in his post). Idk what to do now, I dont get why the mods havent deleted it yet.
$C: Somebody set up us the bomb.
$C: This truly is unbelievable.. Sports watches for only $3.99! 
$C: A pop up ad just opened on baconreader as the gif started. I thought you were some kind of witch for a moment.
$C: The mouse wiggle seems a bit relaxed. 
$C: Best one of these missile defense memes I've seen so far. 
$C: I never laughed so hard at one of these posts. This shot happens to me ALL THE TIME!!
$C: I thought I was the only one who dealt with this.  This is serious LOL material
$C: That mouse cusor shaking is the most relatable thing I've ever seen.
$C: Lol
$C: These ads play with people life
$C: That panic wiggle sold it well.
$C: This is the reason I uninstalled Pandora, rated them one star, then bought Spotify premium. 
$C: Certainly the most likely scenario I've seen.
$C: I hate those that shit so fucking much. I'm glad I'm not the only one it happens to.
$C: üêêThe GOATüêê‚ÄºÔ∏è
$C: The little shake of the mouse really does it for me..
$C: Fuck those ads tho
$C: I love the little cursor shake after like you started just yelling "No No NOOOO!" Good touch.
$C: This actually looks a lot better than [the real UI that was used](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DTpUYcIU0AE2REv.jpg). 
$C: That‚Äôs the best dam meme I‚Äôve ever seen..

Very clever, if you know the facts.

Good work!!!
$C: I refuse to believe this isn't what actually happened 
$C: can we ban commercial ads ?

someone create a serious petition pls.

advertisment - up to $20,000 fine or 2 years in prison
$C: The panicked mouse movements afterwards got me
$C: And it took 40 minutes to correct it because every time they tried to close the window it opened another three. Eventually browser crashed and had to pull the plug to reboot. During restart it got stuck in CHKDSK. Then got stuck in ‚ÄúWindows is Updating 1 of 187‚Äù. 
$C: Such a luck! Imagine if he clicked on the Deal of the day Ads
$C: No system is fail-proof but the fact that they didn't require confirmation by a second party for this blows my mind.
$C: I believe this to be the case over any other explaination.
$C: I like how you can read what the mouse pointer is trying to say.

"no no no no no!"
$C: I love this.
$C: Lmfao I can see that happening. 
$C: Even though theres no audio, i can hear the cursing in my head
$C: Google does this too. You go to click the search bar them BAM, suddenly they‚Äôre trying to teach you all about some irrelevent person that died 300 years ago.
$C: I like how to cursor freaks out.
$C: The reality isn't much better:
https://i.redditmedia.com/kS4S78QVQdlX1FrhB3Mt4glZyOOaeQz5VINKZr2g9b0.jpg?w=1024&s=1622c85d9bbc87d185915e68d6487635
$C: Frantic, panicky mouse scrolling after you realize what you did. Too real.
$C: man f those ads
$C: lol happens to me allll the time, esp on Newegg when I want to add an item to wishlist, it then moves the menu down on me and causes me to cilck add to cart...
$C: I guess we just need a NORAD blocker. 
$C: every damn time, this is literally the only reason we need to upgrade our computers or they slow with time, because the mother trucking adds take 900% more power than the entire website.

edit: ADS
$C: Something actually funny on this subreddit? 
$C: This is the best thing I have ever seen on reddit. thank you
$C: This is actually what's wrong with the world
$C: And when it's an actual warning he downloads the newst flash player.
$C: I feel like I am being fucked in the ass when this happens.
$C: Omfg.  One of the worst things about the internet today.
$C: That‚Äôs pretty believable, sadly. 
$C:  I want to find whoever came up with the code for that shit and rip his/her arms off.  Then beat them with them like in the Toxic Avenger.  It MIGHT make up for all the sports web sites I used to visit that are now ad-centric traps for cheap fans.
$C: Please the fifth
$C: the way the mouse cursor moves in frustration does it for me 
$C: Ad needs to be a tide pod ad.
$C: Ah. The bane of my existence. 

These fucking things. I hate websites that don't set up properly to accommodate for their ads
$C: *Actual Footage*
$C: The real one should have caution signs, red flags everywhere and foul language. ‚ÄúTHIS IS THE REAL F‚ÄîKING DEAL!! PRESSING THIS MEANS S‚ÄîT IS ABOUT TO GO DOWN!!!!‚Äù
$C: And this is why I use adblock.
$C: That's pretty funny, but the truth is just as ridiculous: they selected the wrong option *from a dropdown menu*. Yes, both options "send test warning" and "send actual warning" were together in the same drop-down menu.

Time to hire a new UI designer.
$C: This could work with r/latestagecapitalism 
$C: Maybe next time give credit to the user on /r/ProgrammerHumor who created it. 
$C: This is so true OP! 
$C: I love the anxious cursor move after sending the warning, reminds me of Wallace when he forgets the cheese before departing for the moon. Excellent detail!
$C: You won‚Äôt believe what happened next!
$C: There's a special place in hell for the bastards that create webpages like that.
$C: If this repost gets gilded another damned time
$C: omg this is so true I can't stand those kind of shifty up or down adverts! bollocks to them!
$C: My YouTube experience without Adblock...
$C: Should‚Äôve payed the extra $1.99 for the premium missile warning system. I‚Äôm sure Norway did.  
$C: Fucking Gfycat - why is this suddenly the gif host of choice for Reddit posts?? It does not seem to work at all on iOS with content blockers enabled.
$C: Fucking A
$C: Why did this kind of UI ever become acceptable in the first place? Such a pain in the ass that almost every website does this.
$C: Will this overtake the top post of all time? Check next time on Reddit Royale!
$C: /r/KarmaCourt
$C: God this is so accurate and fucking annoying üòÇüòÇ
$C: Can confirm, I am a confirmer
$C: This would have been better of the ad was for the tide pods
$C: This is the best thing I've ever seen on the internet
$C: I love the little mouse wiggle of despair
$C: Why don't one of the browsers automatically rate websites and warn the user about this kind of garbage? I would use it.  (Bye bye clickbait and such)
$C: I laughed too loud at that.
$C: üò≠üò≠üò≠
$C: This is my life, every damn day. 
$C: So use Brave.
$C: OF COURSE!
$C: Something _actually_ funny on r/funny? Blasphemy!
$C: Cross post that doesn't credit.
$C: This is funny. Upvote.
$C: The [real one](https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/7qs1zt/the_actual_design_of_the_hawaii_missile_alert) is pretty bad. 
$C: Like seriously?! How do they "accidentally" hit send?! There must be a pop up window that says "Are you sure you want to do this?" 
$C: r/ProgrammerHumor
$C: If this is OC those two golds are well deserved. Everytime with those ads. Everytime.
$C: this doesn't belong on /r/funny 

it's funny
$C: I wouldn't be surprised. Happens all the time.
$C: *hits refresh*... *waits even longer* ... *does the same thing again*
$C: This should win Reddit today.
$C: I still can't believe how poorly set up the system was.  If I was literally trying to set up a simple system that would one day have this accident that's how I'd set it up.
$C: When I click the link, I keep getting a gif of a dog who hates his shoes.
$C: That little shaky-shaky side to side is computer gesture for "Noooooooo!"
$C: Too real
$C: That‚Äôs seems like the sort of quality GUI you might want for a nuclear warning system
$C: You have some of those.... Launch codes?
$C: They were using the free version.
$C: I think probably because of net neutrality... it‚Äôs all Ajit pia‚Äôs fault!!!
$C: Crunchyrole. Face palm.
$C: Should have been an ad for Tide Pods. 
$C: This one weird trick develops nuclear programs. Supreme Leaders hate him!
$C: Just imagine if they were trying to send the real one..and kept click on the ad that popped up
$C: When you try to test the missile system in mobile
$C: WHERE ARE DEM TIDE PODS. DEY SHOULD BE  ADVERTISED
$C: The Android notification pull-down bar is infuriating with this. I'll have 5-6 notifications, pull it down and go to click one, and Android decides "oh this isn't in an optimal order, let me just change the order of all the notifications just as ronchalant is about to click one"

$C: Fuck... now I want a sports watch.
$C: Damn sophisticated Russian ads. 
$C: It should be illegal to make a banner ad that's more than a megabyte.
$C: Hilarious
$C: what site is this? lmao

$C: Damn Breo Roam Sports Watches!
$C: * *Looks around* 

**Who programmed it?**

>*Technology doesn‚Äôt preclude responsibility*
$C: This is just the kind of low-content shitpost that I love to upvote the fuck out of.

Bravo!
$C: Except on mobile, where a full screen ad would appear, followed by at least 12 popups, and an autoplaying video that you can't find.

You then click the real alert button because you've realized the world isn't worth saving...
$C: So during all of this I should share that I actually witnessed an accidental firing off of an EAS before when I worked in radio. I was mentoring a rookie DJ who had to do an EAS during her shift and was running her through the checklist of how to do it. The exchange went something like

‚ÄúNow locate the red EAS button‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean this?‚Äù And she presses it

‚ÄúDid you just press it? You weren‚Äôt supposed to press it yet! You have to announce it‚Äôs a test!‚Äù

She flails around in a panic and somehow turns it off
$C: This actually made me chuckle! 
$C: This happens all the time when I clock in for work 
$C: The little mouse wiggle <3
$C: amazing lol
$C: 
M 
$C: Could me so me !!
$C: It's really funny, and really sad that this joke mock-up is legitimately better than the actual system they used.
https://i.imgur.com/UEAzDbg.jpg
$C: Watching a user panic via their mouse cursor is strangely disquieting.
$C: Too real
$C: I suddenly have this with Google and don‚Äôt know how to get rid of it. It‚Äôs pissing me off having to ‚Äòwait‚Äô till the ads pop up.  Pls halp 
$C: üòÇü§£ü§£
$C: My mouth dropped! Lmfaoo 
$C: I've always said ad blocking improves [national] security.
$C: Seems legit.
$C: Literally how our military operates.
$C: This literally happened to me twice trying to open this post. Are you a wizard?
$C: I do this fuckin shit on youtube all the time
$C: God dammit Ajit!
$C: Why don't websites reserve space for images that are about to load so content doesn't get shuffled around as the page is loading.
$C: Whenever I click on something by accident because of this it makes me hate the advertiser.
$C: Argh! Hate those things!
Also, the Channel 4 website. There's no pop in ads like that, but after a few seconds, one more video pops in to the layout, sorting and moving everything differently. Really bloody infuriating. 
$C: Loved how after click the wrong button the pointer try to scream: ‚ÄúNoooooo!‚Äù
$C: Nice that this made me laugh aloud instead of blurting out a string of profanity which I usually do.
$C: The ads will end the world! South Park said so.
$C: Wheres the option for both?
$C: Needs a malicious crypto miner embedded. 
$C: I like to picture the white house with computers all around and they're all running windows 7 and using Opera Mini as their main browser
$C: Actually, this had to have been caused by an ex-coworker of mine. Shortly after he was hired we moved to a new building. This is important because we were going over the new building accouterments which included a silent alarm under the front desk. We were told not to press the button. Surely, what does Mike do? He says, "I don't believe you", and presses the button. He became known as Panic Button Mike from then on until he was let go about a week later.
$C: Haha, surely they know about Adblock.
$C: This is verbatim what happened.

Plot twist:  The ad company is based in Russia.
$C: Wow. Nice repost without giving credit.
$C: Typical government worker, not having ad block 
$C: Somebody change that to porn, it would be helpful as a back up plan.


$C: At first I thought the ad was for Tide Pods
$C: Knew I'd be seeing this bad boy popping up on the front page. Twas too glorious to continue its life in the comments section.
$C: This can't get enough upvotes 
$C: I have no words for how much I hate those.

Edit:  except that one word I used above. 
$C: thats the reason why i just browse the same 10 websites. im not going to browse your fucking website if you let ads pop up like this
$C: Then what took them so long to say ‚Äúwhoops‚Äù
$C: Every fucking time....
$C: wait, this was actually what happened? (minus the ad of course) missile test and actual warning were that close to each other?
$C: I‚Äôm looking at you, REDDIT!
$C: "NO NO NO WHAT DID I JUST DO!"
$C: Not an ad but reddit does the same thing. At the top bar I always try to click ALL but then dashboard pushes the cursor to Popular.
$C: Should have had a Pi-hole running üòÇ
$C: missilememe.mov
$C: I wouldn't be surprised if this was the case 
I've had adblock and other add blocking add-ons for years to the extent that I have literally forgot they exist. And one unforgiving day I was watching TV shows with gf so I load up an online streaming site from her laptop and was just taken aback to some weird fucking sites, nsfw ads like on the sides, like holy shit the ads I was seeing, I thought I'm not on the same site as I usually am from my own pc. Goddam ads. This post triggered some 1stworldproblem ptsd for me jesus, get any adblocking extension it's 1min of work for a lot of minutes of no frustration
$C: Remember in the Missile Warning System ... YOU are the product.
$C: Why the fuck that weird moving around shit keeps happening baffles me. Evey single person on the internet 24/7 and we can't make a browser that loads pages smoothly?

Or is it a case where they don't WANT them to load smoothly? 
$C: This happens to me all the time on Wikia
$C: I wish that could be my actual excuse for doing something bad at work. ‚ÄúSorry, I didn‚Äôt mean to run over that child, but an ad made me do it!‚Äù üòÇ
$C: Holy shit too funny 
$C: S
$C: does anyone find it kind of weird that there is a specific warning like that? how is there a "button" for "warning, missile coming from korea you guys"

how is that a real button in the first place. don't these warnings have to be typed out except common ones like "flood warning" or. "amber alert ________ is missing"
$C: True work of art. Thank you.
$C: it actually was a dropdown menu , and they selected "Real nuclear missile attack" Instead of "Nuclear attack test"
$C: I hate those things so much, especially on mobile.
$C: If you press the red button,it gives a warning not to vote for Trump.
$C: Those bloody ads!
$C: That explains why it took us so long to get the follow-up alert, the computer must've just froze for 38 minutes.
$C: Trololol
$C: FUCK I hate those things!!!!
$C: And now everyone is looking up those Breo Roam Sport Watches
$C: Hahaha omg you whoever created this. YOU KILLED IT . I'm still chuckling 
$C: Should have been a Spam ad.

$C: Considering it just happened in Japan too what are the odds it was a cyber attack and we are just trying to play it off like it wasn't to save face
$C: That frustrated mouse shake tho üòÇ
$C: this is actually awesome

$C: Mwuah!
$C: Wahahaha omg I need to repost this on my fb
$C: This makes me respect AdBlock more than I already do.
$C: this is where the fun begins
$C: Whoa /r/funny on the frontpage again, grab my camcorder Joan I gotta record this.
$C: Oooh nooo. This is too good
$C: Ugh I hate that.   Even Vmware is bad for that.  You click the button to power on a VM, then the links give you the option to open the console, but then it jumps around as you're trying to click it, and the power off button ends up where the open console link is.
$C: I wonder how many suicides took place because of this idiot.
$C: @jackshi3lds
$C: You can feel the panic in the mouse movement.
$C: I think Newegg is the worst offender of this.
$C: I love the mouse wiggle, almost saying, Stop! stop! Sh!t, No!
$C: I can imagine the reaction just by observing the mouse movements. It's a NO NO! 
$C: **
$C: ~~~~**
$C: haha the "OH NO" wiggle
$C: Two gold on a fucking repost?
$C: Pass that buck... uhuh.
$C: Very creative üëç
$C: You karma stealing whore.
$C: Coulda gone for Reddit silver and gone for a tide pod ad instead
$C: I do this all the time on my phone. :(
$C: AdBlock could save us all!
$C: üòÇü§£üòÇ
$C: I am cry laughing 
$C: This is the most real thing I‚Äôve ever seen on this website.
$C: Just think a nuclear apocalypse would have been started because of an ad
$C: See the real issue with the warning system is that there should be real big buttons,  green for drill, red for warning,  and a bigger red one to launch out missiles.  All in a simple row ready to be pressed at a moments notice 
$C: Ahahaha it's always like this and soooo annoying
$C: Should have paid for the premium missile alert system and not just kept using the ad-supported version. 
$C: This is seriously one of the most annoying fucking things ever
$C: Lol
$C: Something about Hawaii has GBP on it ü§î
$C: Yup, they should have gone for the premium tester!
$C: Call me crazy, but somehow I think this test could have been done on purpose by the government just to see how people would actually react in that exact situation.
$C: Only ‚Ç¨399!
$C: I know how that fucking feels, especially with my potato PC
$C: The reason I clicked an ad 99.99% of the time. 
$C: the frustrated mouse shaking is what really makes it convincing.
$C: [pretty interesting video in Paul Rudd take on the missle warning ‚ö†Ô∏è ](https://youtu.be/K5le9sYdYkM) 
$C: Looking at you redditisfun
$C: "See, this is what happens when you play video games. Before you played we didn't have these ads, and now they're all over the place!" - Dad
$C: every. damn.time.
$C: Thank God for adblock. 
$C: I don't get why they do this intentionally for more clicks. How many people have they pissed of vs. How many people accidently clicked on the bullshit popup and actually purchase the bullshit can't be a good ratio
$C: God damn skip loading. 
$C: Blame it on the ads....
$C: Omfg I'm triggered.
$C: Son ov a bee....

I opened Reddit and put my phone in my pocket which somehow clicked this image on the front page and made it go full screen. I pulled my phone out before it locked and crapped my pants like WTF DID I DO?!!!?
$C: Gotta get that ad money.
$C: Thank you for this... hahahaha
$C: In all seriousness,what is the point of warning everyone that a missile is coming?
$C: LMAO Good one!
$C: Love it. very funny!
$C: #Strawpoll  
  
[Without looking, do you remember what advertisement was presented?](https://strawpoll.com/2z91bk4w)
$C: Freaking Priceline.
$C: So annoying! 
$C: Enlarge your penis!
$C: Like they're not also using adblocker.
$C: What are the odds it was Hawaii, one of the only states possibly kinda sorta within range of North Korean missiles?

^^^1/50
$C: Ad-Blockers
$C: Epic YES
$C: These are the absolute worst. Reddit on my tablet will jump up and down when navigating between pages. 
$C: OMFG!!!!!! Hahahahahahahahaha I am dying

$C: This is the funniest shit because I've done this so many times on random websites
$C: this is already at the top of the front page and my comment will be buried, but wanted to thank you for the funniest post I have seen in a long time.  good work sir/ma'am
$C: Ads end lives ~~SO BUY OUR AD BLOCKINATOR TODAY~~
$C: I don‚Äôt know how many times I‚Äôve clicked on the wrong suggested video on youtube because the ad showed up late...
$C: The worst part is, at least in Hawaii, it kinda is like this. The system is literally just an HTML page with a link for each warning.  The links aren't specially colored or anything, just regular old hyperlinks. Abyssmal. 
$C: Hot Take: there was a ballistic missile threat but the government neutralized it over the ocean. Then in order to keep the rest of the US from going into a frenzy of panic and rallying for a retaliation (or not), they played it off as a mistake. They take the fall as being dumb and fucking up, but save a whole flame war and hysteria from all of America. 
$C: Sad thing is, I wouldn't be that shocked if this was actually true.


$C: This happens to me every time I use Bing on mobile - the ad to install Bing app pushes down the search edit text box and I click the install app button.
$C: Bruh, this spoke to me on another level 
$C: Very real possibility lol
$C: I love that distressed mouse wave after he clicked it 
$C: Every man should be able to press back quick enough for it to not go through with it. We all have more than enough practice with our porn sites.
$C: "...

Fuck."
$C: You guys are laughing now, wait till this happens with real nukes.
$C: Someone is gonna get so fired for that.
$C: I bet it is just like this 
$C: Should have been an ad for Tide Pods...
$C: I set up pihole and I never have to do that again. Love it. Messed up some links from slickdeals.net frontpage but I can live with that.
$C: Its worse if you were sending a real alarm, instead you get a pop up for sports watches while people end up dying.

"Why did you not send the warning?"

"Well i clicked on these sports watches and they did have my colour on sale"
$C: I always thought the first nuclear war would be started by an errant drag and drop, turns out dark pattern ads will be the culprit.
$C: I do like how the advert is for something priced in pounds - and so about as relevant to Hawaiians as most of the adverts I seem to get popping up.  And no, although I'm a Brit, I've no idea if that ad is a genuine one or just one somebody has made up for this gif.
$C: I remember in the early web days images on the page had a specified dimensions so that the page would be laid out properly even before the image files were loaded. Why is this not happening anymore?
$C: when i try to add videos to the right playlist on youtube
$C: YouTube is a top offender.
$C: I love the little mouse wiggle after it clicked. I know that feeling really well.
$C: It's funny cos it's true.
$C: Seriously, everyone uses weather.com right?  How many of us always click the frikkin ad when trying to click the 5 day/10 day links under the ad cause the ad loads and moves it down.  
$C: Lol yes damnit
$C: Love the little cursor stutter indicating the ‚ÄúOh shit no.‚Äù
$C: Honestly, it's not [that far from the truth](https://twitter.com/CivilBeat/status/953127542050795520).

With an UI that confusing, I'm surprised it took this long for a false alarm to be sent out.
$C: Looks like government needs to invest more into tech
$C: Loll you should have made it a tide pods add
$C: This happened to me all day!
$C: oh man i hate these things so much
$C: This truly is unbelievable.. Sports watches for only $3.99!


$C: I don't get the joke, what big news story did I miss? All the comments seem to refer to something in hawaii.
$C: Adblock ??
$C: god I just snorted through my nose the hardest I think I ever have when the ad popped up
$C: I‚Äôm actually in Hawaii right now with my family for vacation. We were in our rental car getting ready to head out for the day when the warnings came on our phones. I figured it was a false alarm and turned the car on. That‚Äôs when we heard it on the radio too! The ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù look came across all of our faces. Took the stairs down to the lobby (gotta stay away from elevators when missiles can strike at anytime right?) and joined all the other panicking, scared tourists in the lobby. I was looking up shelters and evacuations routes and didn‚Äôt really find anything. It was surreal to say the least. Had to stay calm for the family. Said fuck it and drove everyone out of the city just in case.

If one good thing can come out of this is that it goes to show a real plan needs to be put in place. Even the locals didn‚Äôt really know what to do.
$C: This is why you need an ‚Äúare you sure‚Äù box
$C: Omg. Totally. 
$C: This is exactly how all that porn got shipped to my house, I swear it
$C: Or it was hacker / nefarious AI...


That's certainly the way to start a war...
$C: What pisses me off is this post gets more upvote than the Original Post. 
$C: Classic didn‚Äôt have adblocker installed
$C: Oh man you are great!!!üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
$C: Make it an ad for tide pods and it's perfect.
$C: LOL
$C: Copy/paste for karma
$C: Buy a new one lol
$C: It's the asbestos. That's what did it!
$C: This is what actually happened
$C: Of course! I do this every day!
$C: MISSILE WARNING FLUSH
$C: Kek
$C: I hate when you try to click something then an ad pops up and ruins it
$C: Problem is ad-block blocks the flash plugin that presents the missile buttons. Whitelist you say? No no that requires emailing tod... fuck that guy.
$C: I really don‚Äôt mind Ads but I started using ad blocker and script  blocker  buz some websites are so Aggressive on how they deliver there ads. 
$C: is this real?
$C: Would have been even more funny if the ad was for eating tide pods
$C: I opened this gif in Brussels airport while waiting for my flight and... well, the look from the person seating beside me was priceless.
$C: Oh man I feel this so much. 
$C: This is TOP
$C: I remember someone on Reddit showing us how to turn this off so that the browser does not flick down right before you click something. I have no idea where to look for that post...
$C: Every. Fucking. Time.
$C: Click the little x when the words load but before it asks you to turn off your ad block. The x becomes your refresh button once the page is loaded. 
$C: Every Damn Time.
$C: Helloooooo Reddit
$C: Should have been an ad for PODS
$C: I haven't seen an ad in years. Feels good to see this joke go way over my head. Thanks AdBlock.
$C: I believe it
$C: Wow. Perfect
$C: so makes sense...
$C: Humor perfection!

$C: I hate when that happens.
$C: Fucking Genius :)
$C: This is the same as every time you go to Bing (which is never, tbh) and the last thing to load just as you go to click the search button is the ad. 
$C: Oh wow I hate bouncy web pages so much. 
$C: damn never be good 
$C: Omg so true. I hate it when that suit happens
$C: Holy shit one hundred thousand upvotes
$C:  Hate when this happens when I‚Äôm watching pornüôÑ
$C: Lmao! This is one of life‚Äôs greatest annoyances 
$C: Omg.  That‚Äôs so accurate!   
$C: That would be funny if it were a tide pods ad haha
$C: Anyone else hope the guy who accidently sent the false alarm does a AmA??? Still not giving his identity obviously lol
$C: they are seriously dumb 
$C: This is THE BEST!
$C: How's the watch, buddy?
$C: If only it were an add for Tide Pods...
$C: There needs to be an extra two beats on this:  
\*The page reloads from top to bottom like they did in 1995 as the person frantically tries to hit cancel.  
\***10 minutes pass**  
\*The page finally finishes loading and he hits the button to send out that it was a mistake.  
$C: Nice try HEM but I'm not buying
$C: That doesn't make much adsense
$C: That‚Äôs why you need a confirmation pop up with no ads smh
$C: So true!
$C: This is the most "OMG Yes" post ever. 
$C: Ads that are part of the layout are pure cancer. There I said it.
$C: GODDAMN SPORTS WATCHES
$C: When there is an actual nuke they will hit the wrong one because they were expecting the popup after the last botched one. 
$C: Repost, you are now on r/karmacourt.
$C: "Ok well everything else works lets just... 

FUUUUUUUUCCCCCCC..."
$C: This is so funny!!!
$C: Shame they didn't pay Comcast extra for more bandwidth...the higher tier packages load the ads first.
$C: Hahahah 
$C: FYI there is a way to prevent this on chrome, but I don't know how to do it.

$C: This made me laugh, I would give you some silver but I have none
$C: I laughed much harder at this than I think I should have.

$C: This graphic is actually more intuitive than the actual link to dispatch the alarm. FFS Merica! We need to get our shit together!
$C: /r/programmerhumour
$C: I love the little mouse shake we do when we mess up on computers. Humans have evolved from violent ways to just shaking a digital cursor around on the screen when we get mad.

$C: Every goddamn time I open a page.

$C: Seriously though, from what I heard, the actual design of the system was not much better than this.  
$C: that reminds me of those popups that when you mouse over them to x them out, they get bigger
then mouse over the bigger x and it moves
this is why I use adblock and why I do not give one mortal fuck if websites get shut down because no ad revenue, fuck them and their shoes.

$C: My god. Master trolling at work there LOL
$C: daily dizzy dinky deals , with deals this dizzy and daily you'll.... fuck
$C: My god this is already on the first page of Reddit's top posts.
$C: I thought of a solution last night:

Test alert goes straight through. Real alert brings up warning message saying to only use in real circumstance. Clicking ok bring up confirmation box that asks if you really want to do this. After that you get a 10 second countdown where the only button on the screen is Cancel. In theory, it shouldn‚Äôt be too much of a hindrance in a real event but enough to stop someone triggering it by accident. But maybe the system should just be more robust in the first place.

$C: Pandora Radio does this with the "Not Now" and "Trial" buttons on their pop up ad to try Pandora Premium or whatever. It's like the perfect timing for when you are about to click "Not Now" and their ad conveniently loads a little bigger and makes you click the "Trial".

this is either a weapons grade idiot, or a bullshit explanation for why this happened. i cant even think of a reason but i dont think this was an accident...
$C: REPOST FROM r/programmerhumor
$C: What makes this worse is that the dude actually had to click through some "are you sure?" Messages before it was sent out.
$C: Hey! Currently in Hawaii. Have a lot of military friends here on the island . Hung out with them the other night . This alert system is not just one button they keep saying . There are a lot more layers to sending out those alerts than ‚Äúone wrong button‚Äù . There 5 of them, navy officers, 1 seal. All are in agree that as no mistake the Hawaii one, they say there was a missile 5 min out from Hawaii and was shot down by 2 f22. Why else scramble all the jets on the island for a fake message?

$C: "I told you we shouldn't have hosted the system on the Forbes wesbite!"
$C: Fun Fact: The creator, John McAfee, himself admitted to not using his own software because the pop-ups are annoying. 

Wonder why he hasn‚Äôt done anything about that...
$C: As a former IT employee, every time I see someone bring up that god awful shitware, I rant: I'm not mad about the fact that it slows down people's computers to the point of being unusable, or that they partnered with Adobe Flash to trick you into downloading it when you update (with the box *checked* by default), but for 2 *even more egregious* factors of bullshit:

- They partnered with Dell and HP and other PC / laptop brands to ship the PC with McAfee pre-installed, so you're computer comes shipped with 50% of its already shitty performance and when you go to Prgrams and Features to uninstall the fucking thing like you can with Avast or any other respectable anti-malware tool, it's ***not there***. 
- *But it gets worse*: McAffe makes a special program that you have to download to uninstall which claims on its documentation not to uninstall it fully:

> If removal fails using the standard Windows removal method, go to Step 2.
 
> Step 2: Download and run the McAfee Consumer Product Removal tool (MCPR)
You should only use the MCPR tool if the Windows removal methods shown above do not work.
> IMPORTANT:
> Always download a new copy of MCPR before each use.  
> This ensures that you have the latest version, and that newer McAfee products can be successfully recognized.
> MCPR will clean up only the components needed for reinstallation. **It is not designed to clean up 100% of components.**
> Completing this step will require a restart.

And better yet, doesn't fucking work at all. So to remove this piece of shit ~~anti~~ malware I have to do a ***complete fresh install of windows***. 

Fuck McAfee, fuck Adobe for partnering with them with underhanded tactics to trick people into installing it, and fuck HP/Dell/any other company for selling you out to shitware before you ever turn your PC on for the first time.

$C: McAfee was provided free to Cox internet subscribers (may still be).
It slowed my desktop to where it was almost unusable.  Switched to ESET NOD.  It detected the McAfee program as a virus.  100% satisfied with ESET.

$C: Complimentary? Don't mind if I doooo. \**Twirls mustache*\*
$C: I have a story now. Last week I noticed that I had a weird charge on my card for an Avast membership that i don't remember signing up for (I'm assuming I got auto added when I bought the pc) so I did what everybody would do and googled a number to call and reverse the transaction.

I call and an indian lady picks up and asks how she can help. I went ahead and explained to her what happens when she hits me with "What kind of protection do you have on your pc?" I didn't really feel like talking to her so I simply said "I'll be fine" she came right back at me and  insisted that I would be "unprotected" and that it would be "safer" to use their product. I'm not saying that she just said it once like she INSISTED that I HAD to use their product until I finally told her "look I didn't ask for this stupid charge on my account I know what I'm doing just tell me how I can get a refund?" She gave me another number and ended the call as quickly as possible.

In the end I hate dealing with these "professional" people over the phone.
$C: Yes. There's actually a technical term for it but I can't recall what it is. It's basically where you delay showing of an element for a period of time typical for someone to browse and click on the target area.
$C: Yes, they do but you can stop it from happening on Chrome;

https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/prevent-scrollbar-jumping-chrome-browser
$C: I'll give you the honest answer, not a bias fed one.

Some do it on purpose, yes. Others just write bad css and don't intend it. For example, if you have an image that is 100 pixels tall and you load it in without telling the browser first how tall it is, it will push everything down once it's loaded rather than before it starts loading.

Real example:

<img src="my-ad.jpg">
vs
<img src="my-ad.jpg" height="100">

But yes, there are others that actually load ads up based on your mouse movements, etc.
$C: Yes, it's pathetic manipulation and why marketers are the worst kind of people. 
$C: Textra is guilty. Get a new text, go to click it, delayed ad pops in under my thumb and I inadvertantly click it. Now I've been conditioned to wait 2 seconds.
$C: There‚Äôs also a bidding process for ads that takes some time and may partly be to blame for the delay
$C: websites get more money for clicks vs adspace.. So they most likely get a click out of you by this, thus getting more money.. But at what cost? (pissing off consumers)
$C: More like the website would do it on purpose because they're getting paid for the clicks.
$C: Litterally the YouTube recommended bar.
$C: Of course. 
$C: Yeah, I see this a lot for ads on torrenting sites. Be patient for a page to load and be wary of everything you click. A nice feature on chrome is that if you hover your mouse over an element that redirects you, chrome will show the address of that redirect in the lower left hand corner.
$C: Yes and no. It's an unintended consequence of lazy loading, and rendering things before they're truly done.

It can be done better though, either by delaying rendering (not ideal) or reserving space. Ideal is actually a combination of both. You might be loading a font that changes the actual size of some text, and rendering could wait for that stuff, but then you might be making a call out to a site that manages some survey form, and that you should probably reserve space for (with maybe a loading mask), rather than simply letting it drop in whenever it's good and ready.

Additionally, some sites do sneaky bullshit as another commenter already mentioned.
$C: You see it in everyday life too. Commercials  placed right after the TV show cuts to a break are from the highest bidder. 
In newspapers, adspace is deliberately put right next to the main article because everyone who reads the article is gonna see it.
In grocery stores, items near the checkout lanes are more expensive and usually sold as singles when you can get 5x of the same thing for barely any more cost somewhere else in the store (i.e. a pack of gum at checkout is $0.99 but in the candy aisle a pack of 5 of the same gum packs is $3.99). It's all mind games, and it's kinda fucked up.
$C: Not sure if there is an exact term for this particular instance, but the general term for a disingenuous user experience is [dark pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern).

You can find more examples here: https://darkpatterns.org/
$C: Youtube does this, or at least used to. What would happen is you look something up, it would usually be the first video, and when you go to click it the advertised video suddenly loads in place of the first video as you hover it. 
$C: Even Reddit did this on the mobile version of the website for several months last year.
$C: Yes, it would be very easy to work it out with css and divs. Then just check it with google analytics to see if it's actually having any affect.

The most annoying meta level of bullshit I've ever seen in my life basically.
$C: Others do it because they can have the ad load after the initial page load so they can have better rated page load times. 
$C: And download sites where I have to look for the most tiny link saying download between humongous Green download links. They are going to catch on to that eventually and make a medium sized button elsewhere 
$C: >unexpected movement clicks?

Google refunds these clicks and many call this "trick to click:
$C: good reminder to get THAADBlock
$C: "After the first actual warning was launched we realized revenue was up and have now included pop ups"
$C: The site itself doesn't have ads but they use Comcast as a provider
$C: Hot single ladies in your area are just waiting to launch your rocket.
$C: I'd be real interested to see the Google Analytics for that site.
$C: Let's implement that system for our nuclear defense system, too! 
$C: I love this!!!
$C: We noticed you're using an Adblock program. Ads keeps the Hawaiian Mission Warning System page running. Please consider white listing us so we may continue to send your state into a mass panic.
$C: Don‚Äôt care who pays as long as my button is bigger than yours!!!
$C: I would have just been relieved I didnt accidentally click the ad, that was the real missile dodged.
$C: You know, they are only doing this because, they want a war with N. Korea. They are testing you. They are starting peace talks, US on the losing side. They won't let that happen. 
$C: They could have some really good targeted advertising. "Watching for large missiles? Why not enlarge YOUR missile by at least 50% or your money back while you do it with this one simple trick? Penis doctors hate this!"
$C: It was probably one of those shitty sites which detects when you have adblock on lmao
$C: test missile warning please ignore
$C: "Today's Missile Warning was brought to you by Blue Apron. Blue Apron is a meal kit delivery service, bringing fresh ingredients and great recipes to your door. This week's menu includes Sun-dried tomato-blasted chicken, eggplant curry, and cauliflower pesto pizza bites. Blue Apron: a better way to cook."
$C: The alert it gonna be up for 10:01 minutes then

$C: its all Logan Paul's fault

$C: Wow, "op" was gilded twice for a repost without even giving credits to the actual creator.

EDIT: The original post got 4 months of gold. Still pisses me off, though.
$C: except this time the punchline is in the title.
$C: Not just that, it was top post just few hours ago.
$C: Wait this isn't even /r/programmerhumor
$C: Doing good work. Sucks to see funny programming reposted without credit
$C: All credit goes to him.
EDIT:
Look, I'm sorry, I never thought this would blow up, I found this gif on a comment on a different post of mine [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7qrom8/japan_broadcaster_sends_false_north_korea_missile/dsrfxpz/?st=jchxm7ds&sh=f1bbbac2), I didnt even know this was posted on someother subreddit, I checked Karma Decay, showed nothing, so I just thought why not post it to /r/funny cuz its suits the style, only later I found it it blew up on another sub, and I gave credit to the guy in another comment (he got triple gilded in his post). Idk what to do now, I dont get why the mods havent deleted it yet, my bad.
$C: Found a picture of OP https://i.imgur.com/t7DTVgm_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium
$C: Just a whole load of hyperlinks? Insane.. funny! But insane...
$C: Is this seriously what it looks like?
$C: Truly the pinnacle of interface design
$C: Hoooooly shit I thought this was a joke. The Washington Post is standing by that as the real system. This should be forever enshrined as the top post in /r/crappydesign
$C: Wow, seeing that I can totally understand why the incorrect one was sent. I could totally see myself tired in the morning not being able to tell the difference. Heck, the gif is better in that it is at least color coded. Red=bad, green = good

2 minutes with mspaint and this design couldve saved a lot of trouble... 
$C: r/softwaregore
$C: That's fucked. I don't blame the employee for his mistake in any way at all.

The designer of that UI needs to brush up on their skills. If that interface was web based literally anyone with a few hours of HTML and CSS training could do better. 
$C: Oh my god, what a mess.
$C: oh my god this is awful
$C: Lol, this is even worse than I imagined.
$C: Wow, I have a lot less blame for the end user now.
$C: From what I understand, they also had to click yes on an "Are you sure?" dialog box, a security feature which is easily bypassed by muscle memory.

The GUI trains people to make this mistake. A better GUI would've a different type of confirmation for extraordinary actions from the ordinary ones in order to jolt users from their routine.
$C: No way, it looks like the internet 18 years ago 
$C: It's hard to imagine how they missed it with those colour circles there. 
$C: Oh what the actual fuck. Do they have a Github repository? I'll donate time to make something that doesn't contribute to mass panic. 
$C: Yikes, this is like a more serious version of Steve Harvey's Miss Universe gaffe. UI design folks, it's important.

$C: Imagine if they had a nationwide alert button. Damn, dimsum would‚Äôve been hella quick. Perhaps, free. 
$C: Good enough for government work!
$C: Tests are only done on the first of the month. so still doesn't make sense. Also shift changes is probably not when you test shit. Someone needs to get fired 
$C: YouTube

$C: [True](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-does-have-a-button-on-his-desk-but-its-not-for-nukes/article/2644807)
$C: Fuck Trump, but that is a legitimately funny gag. 
$C: How much-a Coke?
$C: But how big does the button have to be?
$C: http://time.com/4758059/donald-trump-coke-nuclear-button/
$C: You too, huh? So how many missile false alarms have you reported? 
$C: I swear advertisers pay extra for the page to move the *second* before you click.
$C: On the bright side, this is how I imagine people upvoting me.
$C: YouTube plugin that bounces what you're trying to click three times, two times, five sometimes, and sometimes not at all.

I'm just tryna see some stats on the video, plugin what the hell
$C: Wtf is findomanpig
$C: I had an extension that did that and I deleted it immediately 
$C: My ad blocker gets rid of them.
$C: Twitter search too, except instead of clicking an ad you click an unrelated hashtag.
$C: Funny considering admob (their advertising platform for mobile apps) has in their terms of service that you cannot force users to click the ads through methods like this. I guess it's okay if Google does it, but not app developers. (To clarify, NO ONE should do it)
$C: But that wouldn't work in this case.

The button that was clicked was available the whole time. The ad was the new thing but that's not what was clicked.
$C: This is a good idea
$C: I don't think that would work well since a lot of our clicking is based on quick muscle memory.
$C: Or, you know, not have ads like this. 
$C: I got a high score! 13276ms!

Beat that!
$C: They should maybe do that as a toggle, I for myself would hate that, most of the clicks I make are from muscle memory and way faster than half a second
$C: [deleted]
$C: But in this case it wouldn't do anything because the button had already been visible. The ad appeared, but he didn't click on that. Ignoring clicks on objects that just recently appeared will only work a fraction of the time.
$C: Intelli mouse with behavioral analysis. Will be possible as soon as we have technology for continuous user authentication
$C: Or just get adblock
$C: Too bad it‚Äôd never come into play since advertisers do this crap on purpose
$C: You really think they don't do it on purpose?
$C: My ideal extension would disable all goddamn timers/timed events on a webpage and optionally Javascript too especially for reading articles. 

The more annoying ones are the ones that track your mouse and if it detects you're moving off screen (as if to hit the back button) it shits out a modal filling up the whole screen asking for you to sign up for their newsletter.
$C: Or use uBlock Origin to block all ads
$C: Wow I'm super slow. I thought around 320ms was okay until I looked at the stats. Getting old!
$C: Here's a better solution. Websites could implement the ads directly into their website rather than create an ad-space that is filled by some unknown third party website. They'd lose the ability to target ads based on your browsing history, but it would also solve the problem of everyone avoiding the ads via adblocker.
$C: Average was 307ms and my best was 276

This was on my phone
$C: Ugh. But then that means having to wait a full 400 Ms to close that popup ad that covers 85% of the screen.
I'd rather have a few nookular missile texts each year
$C: I just want a feature, that when I accidentally click on a mailto: hyperlink it asks "are you sure" instead of spending 10 minutes trying to open and initialize outlook because I've never set it up. 
$C: https://i.imgur.com/kjkJjTg.jpg
$C: This sounds a good startup idea 
$C: those ads are delayed on purpose to generate miss clicks 
$C: I like your smartnesses.
$C: This needs to go ti the top, everyone make it happen this is gold
$C: Is that back up again? I haven't visited since the FBI busts (in 2016?).
$C: Yeah, shame on /u/guyi568, wow he actually deleted his profile for that..
$C: lol you spelled his name wrong
$C: We see that you're running ad blocker.  please disable it to access our website.
$C: From time to time I enjoy reading articles from my home state on a local newspapers website. Of course they give me the whole "We see you are using Ad Blocker. Please disable it to continue reading." 

At first I did because I can respect that. But then it turned out that they only give you 5 "free" articles a month. Well they have no idea that if you cancel the page while loading just as the article fully loads, the article is never locked behind a pay wall and it wont recognize Ad Block.

So fuck them.
$C: Whenever I'm on a fresh install of an OS I am rudely reminded how unusable the internet is without one.  Sites have gone full retard now days in how riddled with ads they are, and the really annoying bloated javascript garbage ones too that slow down page load.  These companies wonder why everyone is using adblockers.  Youtube without an adblocker is brutal too, watch this 30s ad before you can watch this 5s cat video. 
$C: What about ads that ignore your ad-blocker despite you having "acceptable ads" off AND also not having the site with the ads on it on the "ads are accepted through the blocker" list..
$C: my cell phone doesn't have ad blockers
$C: Or you could just use the  uBlock Origin extension to block ads
$C: It used to be said that the greatest performance upgrade you could make to an old computer was to install an SSD. Nowadays, I would say a good adblocker is even better.
$C: Slower. Then they couldnt afford to make it fast. 
$C: It wouldn't really make any difference. The ads themselves are what eat up bandwidth. I doesn't matter whether they are deliberately chosen or random.
$C: ...and then the phone vibrates like a chain reaction
$C: Lies, you reposting *villain!*
$C: I was hoping for a Tide Pods ad
$C: lmao. You crossposted, you didn't repost man. Read reddiqueutte, **it's absolutely fine** and encouraged. Don't listen to the hordes of comments of people saying you reposted, you didn't. Stop worrying dude. Reddit is like 80% crossposting and reposting. 
$C: You had to steal the top post of /r/programmerhumor and post it here?
$C: Please tell me it was a mis-click because of an ad.
$C: TIFU by making Hawaii think they were getting nuked.
$C: Master OC... you survived
$C: Karma Decay hasn't been very reliable to me lately. Another thing you can try is using Reddit's search function to search for the URL you're about to post.
$C: I prob wouldn‚Äôt have seen it today had you not cross-posted it. So thanks for the laugh, man.
$C: You're a TIFU incident
$C: You mean r/programmerhumor.
$C: Yeah well
$C: Reddit on Opera is a revelation.
$C: Maybe collaborate with the reddit /r/assholedesign/

Get this momentum people
$C: r/noisygifs
$C: "Yeah sure let me look that up for... OK my system needs a reboot it will just be threeeee, ugh, thirty-eight minutes."
$C: I'm guessing the PC in this is running Linux given the black cursor. Though they could have a black cursor theme on Windows.
$C: > you piece of shit

That is kinda harsh.  Not EVERYONE on /r/funny subscribes to ProgrammerHumor.  Posting it to /r/funny gives it a bigger audience.  Not a big deal.
$C: But he cross post-- no, no he didn't. At least he gave cred-- hmm, nope. Well, I'm gonna need a pitchfork. 
$C: Just wait for /u/gallowboob to post it again in a couple of days. 
$C: I think you meant r/ProgrammerHumor.
$C: Where did he say he made it? 
$C: I can't imagine being so upset about Internet points like you are is fun. I mean, come on, not a big deal is it, really. 
$C: How dare he steal their precious karma!
$C: Enjoy the gold kid. Nothing personal!
$C: Wow you take reddit too seriously.
$C: Hey you did the right thing by giving credit where it is due. Don't sweat it. There is many kahrma whores on reddit and you aren't one of them. Enjoy your gilding and consider it a lucky blessing. 
$C: At first I was like 

*THAT'S GREAT! LOL*

Then I was like 

*WAIT IT'S NOT ORIGINAL?? WHAT A SHIT*

And then I saw this comment from you, with the original creator giving you his blessing, and I went

*AWWW WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES, YOU OWNED UP AND I RESPECT THAT, HERE'S AN UPVOTE KID*
$C: What happen
$C: Use the uBlock Origin extension to block all ads
$C: Time sensitivity is probably a large factor in why there is not to give people the maximum amount of time to seek shelter. I cant find the exact time to Hawaii, but an ICBM from NK to NYC would only take 40 minutes. So lets just guess 15 minutes... what would be the point of a warning system if by the time you got your second approval the missile would of already landed?
$C: I lost it at that point. 
$C: How about the "are you sure?" button...
$C: [deleted]
$C: It's plagiarism from r/programmerhumour
$C: It does this with the Share menylu as well! About to share this YouTube video via messenger. Nope! Now I'm posting it on FB :/
$C: Pretty sure this is most often by design...
$C: It's intended.
$C: More likely, the NK are doing something really suspicious and someone had a quick trigger finger.
$C: If the website creator is getting compensated for click-throughs, they don't really care how pissed off those click-throughs are.
$C: It's so you know not to queue up for a League match.
$C: Pretty good point, I mean if you have a bunker 10 minutes away, sure.  And now, the next warning will also have to specifically say, "This is not a drill. This is not a false alarm. There really is a missile coming." Id probably still just go about my business. At this point, just get rid of it.
$C: The worst part is, like with these mainstream news sites for example like the washington post or ibtimes etc. instead of finding ways to improve their sites and therefore their revenue they just get more fucking obnoxious with their spamming and pretty much force you to ignore their site entirely.

The websites aren't even fit for purpose anymore, I agree, let them go bankrupt, bunch of unbelievably annoying cunts.

$C: [deleted]
$C: Not really UI related and it‚Äôs an old joke, but this one killed me: https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/7qtzjk/another_hawaii_warning_system/
$C: https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/7qrej8/real_screenshot_from_hawaii_warning_system_actual/?utm_source=reddit-android
$C: Not according to the Hawaiian governor. They basically said that it‚Äôs a drop down menu with no cancellation button. However, now that they‚Äôve had this mishap, they have a confirmation button and it takes two people to activate the alerts. 
$C: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. A jet. Shooting down an intercontinental ballistic missile. Good one. ICBMs don‚Äôt fly a few kilometers above sea level, a well-constructed one can go up to around 1,200 KM into the air, roughly 66 times the height ceiling of an F-22. Assuming you‚Äôre telling the truth about your military friends telling you this, I honestly think they‚Äôre fucking with you. In my experience both vets and active duty love to tease.
$C: yea you say that after you get called out on reposting
$C: Hawaii got a false nuclear warning. The joke here is that the pop-up, everyone‚Äôs least favourite part of the internet next to virus‚Äô and Ajit Pai, caused a real warning to be sent instead of a test one.
$C: I think you've got the wrong thread, buddeh
$C: They scramble jets for all kind of crap.  A possible fake message is reason enough for those guys to get some flying time in.
$C: BLUE TEAM IS SOOO MUCH BETTER THEN RED TEAM!!!! 
$C: Yeah, you're a drag

$C: wow
$C: do you like squirrels?
$C: u88iii
$C: He's down in Mexico partying all day and has nothing to do with the company anymore.
$C: Set up my parents new computer last weekend, got a call two days later from them asking why the virus software wasn't working.

Apparently they were so used to the McAfee popups / desktop icons / etc. that they didn't think it was working if they didn't see it.
$C: I'm pretty sure he sold the company and retired to Columbia where he enjoys hookers and cocaine regularly.
$C: He sold McAfee a long time ago and now has another [security company](https://mgtci.com).
$C: Because he doesn't have time to care. He now spends his days shilling random cryptocurrency coins for money, like an absolute ass.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Well, [he made a video how to uninstall](https://youtu.be/bKgf5PaBzyg)
$C: He doesn‚Äôt own the company, and hasn‚Äôt for awhile. I highly recommend reading his story, dudes living a wild life
$C: Is it even his software anymore?
$C: He sold off his company back when it was the premier anti virus software company. They then ran it into the ground making it the shitty bloated worthless mess it is today. He hates it so much that he made a ridiculous YouTube video detailing how to uninstall it. 
$C: Because he doesn't actually have any affiliation with the company now.  Hasn't for a long time.

He's also a crazy son of a bitch, in that half-fun, half-scary kind of way.  Highly recommend looking up stuff about his life story if you haven't before.  Fun reading.
$C: That's why I love Bit Defender, set it and forget it.
$C: it's not his software anymore, hasn't been for a long time.
$C: > Wonder why he hasn‚Äôt done anything about that...

Because he doesn't own it or have any control over it?
$C: Because he doesn‚Äôt have a say in it anymore. 
$C: He is paid large money to shill alt cryptocoins. He is responsible for many pump and dumps.
$C: https://youtu.be/bKgf5PaBzyg
$C: He's a crypto shill now, he left antivirus game a long time ago
$C: [He did do something about it](https://youtu.be/bKgf5PaBzyg)
$C: He has.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=91s&v=bKgf5PaBzyg
$C: > Wonder why he hasn‚Äôt done anything about that...

Because it's right in your first statement: he's the creator, not the current owner or developer or even a board member. 

He did take the time though to create a helpful video on how to remove McAfee Antivirus since so many people have directly written to him about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKgf5PaBzyg
$C: [Watch the video](https://youtu.be/bKgf5PaBzyg) he made, it's even better
$C: You should give it a try, they have now made the program really nice.
$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKgf5PaBzyg
$C: He sold the company like 20 years ago dude..
$C: Hasn't the creator stated repeatedly that he has nothing to do with McAfee anymore? Apparently he has people ask him all the time why "his" software does this or that. The truth is he hasn't had anything to do with McAfee since 1994 when he left the company. If you haven't seen [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKgf5PaBzyg) give it a watch, it's pretty great!
$C: Because intel owns it now 
$C: our family pc has that software
$C: Fun fact: Sloths sometimes grab their own arms after mistaking them for a branch and fall to their deaths!
$C: I just got a new XPS 15 and it was pretty easy to get rid of on mine.
$C: Avast has kinda gone downhill too, at least in the bloatware department. Still not as bad as McAfee at least.
$C: I think the technical term is "Sneaky Fucking Bullshit."
$C: Its called r/assholedesign
$C: Just curious, has anyone ever accidentally clicked the ad and then ended up going, huh, wow, I can save up to 30% on cleaning supplies at Target.  Well look at this, swiffer mops on sale! 

I mean I figured 100% of people click the back button before any images even begin to display.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I think it's something similar to "click jacking".
$C: Unironically, this kind of bullshit should be illegal. Think about it in any other context. If, at the checkout, a cashier quickly scanned something and threw it in your cart before you said no, would that be okay? Or if a group of people surrounded you at a store with signs and wouldn't let you leave without basically punching one of them and quickly running away. So why is it okay to do online?
$C: Kijiji is famous for this.
$C: Native advertising, it covers moving ads, ads that look like the play button, all of those ‚Äúdownload now‚Äù buttons, pretty much any deceptive advertisement on the internet falls under native advertising 
$C: Pandora does this too
$C: No, it's not on purpose. When a page is loaded there's a script that starts a pretty complicated advertisement bidding process which eventually loads the ad that's customized just for you. You know, if you've just bought a pair of pants it's likely to show an ad for the same fucking pants. 

But this takes time and the rest of the page has loaded hundreds of milliseconds ago. To make it worse, the exact size of the ad isn't known until it has been chosen, so there's no way to make a right-sized placeholder for the pants ad.

TL;DR It takes a while for the ad broker to figure out what kind of ad to show to you
$C: Relay all damn day.
$C: Integrating psychology into software dev
$C: There's a concept in UI design that dictates that you don't move things on screen if possible.  Not only is it good for performance (every time something on a web page moves, it forces the browser to reflow the layout) it's also good for the user.  One that annoys me currently is logging into AWS Opsworks and you want to click on a stack.  They have a loader that shows up initially and disappears causing the thing you want to click on to move up and you sometimes accidentally click the item in the list below it.
$C: It's called a shadow box.
$C: Yes, some websites have it so that there is actually a hover event listener on the cheaper button, to generate an ad and hopefully create this type of mistake.
$C: The illicit intention to do this is called click-jacking

**BUT**

99% of the time, if something like that occurs, it's due to something called [asynchronous loading](https://www.adglare.com/kb/4/Why-is-asynchronous-ad-loading-so-important).
Due to the fact that ads love to be HD, they take forever to load, causing them to change the layout of a webpage as they load in.

If a"clickjack" seems to happen on very popular website such as Pandora, it's not on purpose, as companies care a shit ton for legit clicks, you will be banned from using their service if you do such a thing.

Source: have worked with such things.
$C: It's perhaps one of the most frustrating things on the web, and really it's a scam against the advertizers as well...  they often pay for the ads per click, with the unmentioned assumption that the people clicking on the ads are actually interested in the product being advertised, and therefore there is a chance that that click will lead to a sale.  

The site is tricking people into clicking on the ad, and no one in their right mind would purchase anything that they were tricked into clicking on, so the site gets some money but the advertizers get nothing in return, or might even anger potential customers.

Thankfully Google and other tech companies are starting to crack down on these sort of shady tricks, as are other tech companies by penalizing them in various ways.
$C: I really doubt it, since an abundance of mistaken clicks will do nothing but lower your CPC, not only making the benefit of the behavior a wash, but lowering your potential from future campaigns and overall destroying your bottom line. Ad providers' #1 goal is to make all clicks intentful as that dramatically raises the prices they can charge. A bad click is worse than no click at all.
$C: Pretty sure someone posted a thread recently titled "What technology can fuck right off?"

Better add this to that list.
$C: Yeah, click jacking I think
$C: I'm not sure whether there's a separate technical term for it specifically, but the broad term for intentionally misleading users via UI design is called "dark patterns".
$C: Asshatery
$C: Idk if it‚Äôs the technical term but I see t called ‚Äúclick-jacking‚Äù 
$C: Funny thing is I wait for these things, but I think it's rigged. Not a timer. I'll hover over something for 30 seconds waiting for an ad to appear so I can avoid it, right as I click it jumps like that or an ad appears at the exact same time. There's literally nothing you can do to avoid it without adblock.
$C: I don't know the term but I hope the person who invented it burns in hell.
$C: This is why I hate the textra app. EVERYONE on r/Android loves it. 
$C: Thing that pisses me off is it triggers the jumps while I'm just trying to read an article. So I get a quarter of the way in and get thrown back to the top.

This shit is why I use adblock.
$C: [Dark patterns](https://darkpatterns.org/)
$C: I like the widely known phrase "bait and switch" for this.
$C: I call it a giant waste of money because I have specifically boycotted products because their ads have annoyed me mildly. 
$C: Reminds me of SourceForge where there are about 5 different "Click to Download" buttons on the download page.
$C: I think it's called "dark pattern" or somewhere along those lines
$C: I just thought it was shity companies not using faster servers.
$C: While the jokes are obvious, the real answer is called polite load. Ads are coded to let the webpage load first before the ad so users get the content they are seeking. 

However, now with responsive sites (sites the adjust based on your screen size allowing one site for all screens vs. many site - aka no more m.site.com), the pages adjust based on the loaded content, which includes ads. 

Couple the two together, you get missile launch warnings.
$C: Dark Patterns is the broad term this falls under 
$C: In UI/UX circles I believe it's called a dark pattern. Similar ethically to say - black-hat SEO practices.
$C: Not sure what the term is, but it's probably using similar code to what those stupid exit-popups use.
$C: Damn advertising companies are getting smarter every damn day...
$C: They need an ad sfx after you click by Dave Chapelle; ‚ÄúGotcha Bitch‚Äù!
$C: Reddit does this for the moble app.  I use chrome because your fucking app is fucked half the time!
$C: Clickjacking
$C: Nowadays you can wait until the mouse moves over a certain portion of the screen; i.e. every pop up that only comes when I move my mouse to the top of the webpage to close the tab
$C: Dark Pattern.

The Washington Post has ads on their mobile website which open a new window when you swipe over them while scrolling down their content.

$C: It's a thing called [dark patterns](http://www.darkpatterns.org)
$C: Oh shit, thats actually a thing!
$C: This needs to be its own OP in reddit somewhere. Great info and more pertinent now than ever.
$C: [deleted]
$C: wouldn't this stop the automatic scrolling to a comment (or part of a page you were on before you exited the page and then reentered the same page)?
$C: Is there something like this for Firefox?

Edit: Theres a ton of options like autoscroll in about:config, but maybe someone knows so I don't have to try :)
$C: Great advice, but that website gave me cancer. (I don't fault you)
$C: thank u sir u saved my life

Also, the page you linked scroll jumped pretty hard on me, 10/10 troll
$C: I was just about to say major browsers need to have something like this. Have my upvote
$C: 1. Type Chrome://flags into search bar
2. Find Scroll Anchoring (CTRL+F type anchor)
3. Change Default to Enabled in the dropdown menu
4. Click the relaunch now button at the bottom right corner of the screen (or enter chrome://restart into search bar)

EDIT: Does anyone know how to make this work for the mobile app?

$C: The Hero we need.
$C: This is also useful on Twitch, where it keeps the scroll from moving up while you're looking at older chat comments. 

Or, at least, it used to. I think Twitch may have finally fixed the issue.
$C: Scroll anchoring is already a default setting in Chrome.
$C: It's called ublock origin.
$C: Or you can avoid all terrible ad design by using the brave browser. 
$C: Thank you. Was going to reply with the same thing.  Some do it blatant with javascript. Some do it kind of blatant with delayed loading since they know the ad is loading in a spot you would click. 

Some don't do it on purpose but are lazy and don't include the CSS or the ad can be different sizes depending which loads so don't take that into account in their layout. The lazy way is because the ads are not being served from the website you went to so it takes additional time for the call to be made to the ad server, for your cookies/identity to be processed, and the right tailored ad to be downloaded and displayed.
$C: it probably started out as bad code, then someone realized you could exploit that
$C: Reddit does this to me all the time.
$C: Let's be fair to marketing, this is only *one of* the reasons why they are the worst kind of people.
$C: And we get paid a lot to be the worst üòâ
$C: they are just doing their job too I guess
$C: Why does everyone on reddit share this hatred for all marketers? I get that plenty of them do scummy things like this, but the large majority don't. 

*Good* digital marketers understand that you can't force anyone to do something, because they'll quit at some point on the path. You have to get them to actually want the thing. 

Anyway, just consider the fact that most actual marketers are real humans who love creativity and such, not scammy bs machines. Source: am human marketer
$C: üòí
$C: Seriously what does marketing contribute to society.
$C: I paid for Textra. Totally worth the $3
$C: Worked on me. This alone got me to pay the $3 for the app.
$C:  There is an option to have the ad show at the bottom of text list instead of the top. Stopped that issue for me. 
$C: if everyone does it we don't really have a choice though ..
$C: I appreciated this way more than I probably should have
$C: ADNauseam is so much better it clicks the ads for you in the background forcing the ad providers to pay for those ads and you never see the ads because it's registered clicked.

$C: As always on r/funny
$C: Why not mention that it's an x-post then...
$C: Then give him your karma.
$C: Oh now you want us to go to your other post and upvote?! You can't trick me! Pitchforks!! 
$C: To oblivion, I say!

Edit: you're even getting gilded for this blasphemy. Shame. 
$C: You should‚Äôve mentioned that then...
$C: Pay the gold forward to the original poster on programmer humor
$C: Tell it to the judge! Book him Dan O!
$C: Kill your link before it undergoes metastasis. 
$C: They probably paid $20 million for someone to design it too.

$C: From another source:

>Richard Rapoza, the public information officer for Hawaii‚Äôs Emergency Management Agency, tells The Verge that while the image above is not an actual image of the emergency alert system, it is ‚Äúan acceptable representation of our system.‚Äù An actual image can‚Äôt be released ‚Äúfor security reasons,‚Äù Rapoza said. But these samples were given out as a means of explaining what happened.
$C: Yeah, I asked myself why there wasn't any checks for sending this kind of warning. I mean, they check if we are robots for every fucking thing that we do.... Just put a good ol' captcha there ma boi
$C: Honestly it's sort of a good thing this happened, seeing how all this stuff about unpreparedness was brought to light. Now, whether they will actually make any measurable improvements...
$C: "You are about to cause a damn human stampede. Only proceed if there will be an actual bloody fireball"

"Is giant fireball imminent?"

no... on second thought this isn't a good time.

$C: Japan in the 40s i tried to send a real alarm but got stuck trying to win an iphone
$C: 7
$C: Algorithms and AI predictability will be the end of our sanity. Yes, me too, too.
$C: It's the load time from the ad server. It has to check what ad is next to be served to you and then sends it. It's time consuming.

Weirdly my bank used to do something similar but it was house ads (advertising their self or something they provide) during a login screen, it took a second to load the ad right when I would click on username text box, the ad would show up in the same spot.
$C: I'm pretty sure that is exactly what they do and even use a timer for those ads to load
$C: Can confirm. Upvoted you.  
$C: As a right handed scroller on mobile, I do this all the time.
$C: Will you marry me? I just realized I had an extension installed for something I needed like a month ago. I uninstalled it and my problems went away! You are amazing. I love you.
$C: How did you figure out which one did it? I have this issue too.
$C: That's right of course. "Visible at the location of the click" would be more precise.   

**Edit:**    
Although that would break clicking on moving objects like in some types of games. It's trickier than it sounds, but that's one of the things I meant by possible side effects.    
One would probably disable it for games anyway. It's just a rough idea I had once. Making it work well is a project of its own.
$C: Once the layout changes, ignore ALL clicks for a bit.
$C: I wonder if it would be possible to add in some option to, when an object's relative position to the base page changes, it tracks the time (in milliseconds) that this happened. If a sufficient time hasn't passed since it last moved, on-click events don't fire (or warn the user before firing). 

Slightly more RAM intensive since it needs to keep track of an additional property for each element in the DOM, but should be doable. I think it'd have to be a browser feature, but I don't know enough about extensions to know if that's feasible in that field. 
$C: You're a good idea 
$C: Good ol' nuclear missile muscle memory
$C: That should not be an issue if it's optional.     

It should also use context to estimate how likely the click would be intentional. That's the kind of thing I mean by "refining".  

Do you actually move the mouse to the location you expect something to show up, and click before you see it?

Because as soon as you saw it, it would be covered by your response time and would go through.

$C: You are such a power user that you can't waste 400ms after the page loaded to start 
clicking?
Also this could be made so that the initial page redering wouldn't have the delay, if you are one of those people that know where the button is going to load and clicks it as soon as it's available. Only objects that didn't load after the initial pass can be subject to delay, also the objects they have moved when they spawned could be put in delay. This could work but the actually correct way of solving the problem is creating a transparent placeholder to hold the layout for items that are still loading. I think modern browsers do that already? I don't remember the problem on the gif happening with me since web 2.0 days really.
$C: Yea but no matter how good your muscle memory is I doubt it‚Äôs quicker than what you can see with your eye.  The point of this is that you wouldn‚Äôt be clicking on an object that isn‚Äôt there anyways, which is essentially what happens when you mistakenly click these serious ads; you intend to do one thing then because it‚Äôs so quick you accidentally click on another. 
$C: It's really not that bad. Firefox does this for download links - it just makes everything feel deliberate
$C: Option and blacklist/whitelist cover it being a choice.    

The time is also not intended as a fixed value, it's individual. Unless you click on invisible objects fast clicks are covered by your response time, which you can test online.

$C: This doesn't have to affect all objects, just the ones that modified the layout after the initial rendering pass. Ideally the delay wouldn't even ever trigger, as the layout isn't really supposed to move at all after it's put on screen, onless it's an animation obviously, hence the whitelist/blacklist OP suggested.
$C: The 400ms is just an example.     

I would not outright dismiss the concept. The scientific way would be to design a prototype and run measurements.

Determining the required information and making it available would be part of designing and implementing such a system on the OS level.

It might also well be that it also helps if the threshold is 180ms, as it's very unlikely that a click was intentional then, unless people click on invisible objects just before they appear. But clicking like that would only be reliable on a real-time system anyway, which is not the case in most consumer devices.

I just wanted to get the idea out there. Maybe someone is in a position to do something useful with it.
$C: This would only really be useful in browsers, so the only application that could implement that would be webkit and equivalents. I think OP just said computers as a generalisation. I think his idea should be simple enough to implement, everytime a page element "pushes" others, it and all it pushed are put on freeze for a set amount of time.
$C: They could just momentarily disable clicks on the entire part of the site below the point where layout reflows
$C: Just extend the delay to the objects the new object moved also.
$C: Keep in mind, that the latency of your input device and screen also affect the measurement. 
$C: It's not just a browser or ads problem though.    

In a multitasking environment an application window can pop up right under your mouse pointer as you click.

My personal pet peeve is windows explorer. Moving a file into a folder that contains a lot of other folders. If you hover over a folder for too long, it opens. If you let go of the mouse button just a little too late, your file will end up in some other folder, as it scrolls while opening the folder.     

That's why i wrote "computers" in general.
$C: No, you could close it as soon as you saw it. That's what using something like your individual response time means.
$C: Solarmoviez and fmovies are what we use, if one is lagging usually the other one works
$C: Last I checked, it went back up, but all the links were ass-quality cam nonesense.
$C: Have no idea. I stopped using it well before then.
$C: Been up for a while. There's a couple different domains as well.
$C: This guy gets it.
$C: That does sound like the sort of thing I'd do.
$C: ah, observant as always, u/TrumpSonWorryLibs
$C: Sure, yo yo yo, that's why I've gots this ad-blocker BLOCKER. See, when a motherfucker tryin' to bust your ad-blocker with an ad-blocker blocker this motherfucker is gonna bust the motherfucking ad-blocker blocker that's blocking your uh uh uh...

$C: Looks like I will have to teach YOU, how to be...  
  
REPOSTING-VILLAINZ!
$C: But I didn't crosspost it the right way..damn this feels bad. There are innocent comments thinking this is my oc! I'm trying my best to spread the message!
$C: Guna say I was fairly sure this was near the top of /r/all earlier today....
$C: Better question is why does any kind of low-hanging fruit like this ever make it to the top of any page?
$C: Yeah but for some reason it always says the servers are crowded when I do that!
$C: In fairness, the other one has over 40,000 upvotes and has been #1 on all for hours.
$C: It was on the generic front page....im not subscribed yet i still saw it
$C: *Send actual pitchfork*
$C: I did give him cred, its in the comments, before you take the pitchfork let me explain..

Look, i never thought this would blow up, I found this on a comment on a different post of mine [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7qrom8/japan_broadcaster_sends_false_north_korea_missile/dsrfxpz/?st=jchxm7ds&sh=f1bbbac2), I didnt even know this was posted on someother subreddit, I checked Karma Decay, showed nothing, so I just thought why not post it to /r/funny cuz its suits the style, only later I found it it blew up on another sub, and I gave credit to the guy in another comment (he got triple gilded in his post). Idk what to do now, I dont get why the mods havent deleted it yet, my bad.
$C: I did not block him just to downvote him. To this day, there is not a post I see of him that is not downvoted. Even at 38k upvotes, I'll be there to cast my downvote.
$C: This is just a mistake i made that blew up, 

I cant find any effective way to tell others that this isn't mine, Im commenting this on all the comments about this being a repost as much as i can.

$C: Yes.
$C: You'd have two people available at all times.
$C: > How is this bad exactly?

Yup a true programmer here.  

It is truly a crap design prone to error.

$C: One of the presented issues is the lack of an ability to retract the system. I believe they said the reason it took so long to revert the alert is because they had to have approval from a government agency to call off the alert. 


A proposed fix was for the drill to be a one button start, whereas the actual warning requires a second affirmation first.
$C: or NK hacked and set the alert off to see what we do, as a trial run. next time they do it, we call it a false alarm, then the missile is launched. if another alert came right after a false alarm everyone might blow it off. 

We said it was a mistake because saying we got hacked would probably cause mass panic.
$C: Ya but in order for the company to pay for their ad they must be making a significant amount of money off of the ads in order to justify the marketing costs of making that ad clickbait rather than just a banner on the side
$C: you gotta be ruthless with it.  I'm kind of an asshole about my stance on ads, and will make no apologies for it. they're annoying, and they're dangerous too

No exceptions, cold turkey, no mercy.
fuck all ads to death.

$C: By the way, as a Nathan myself, I just want to say I've spent many years searching for the ALPHA NATHAN and I never expected to find him here.

To be honest, now that my journey is finally over, I feel like... something is missing. A sense of purpose, perhaps. 

Or maybe it's the disappointment that after following all the maps and clues from my predecessors, none of it actually mattered. The ALPHA was here all along, in a random Reddit thread. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, my life -- the last decade and a half spent searching for you -- didn't turn out quite like I imagined. Still, I can't deny the fire my heart now feels for finally finding our Master.

Oh, how jealous the other Nathans will be once I tell them the news!

Please, ALPHA -- is there any wisdom you can pass to me, so that I may be made more complete? More... *Nathan*?

$C: John McAfee is basically Tony Stark in real life.
$C: Mexico? I thought he was in Guatemala...
$C: He *was* in Belize. Now he's back in the USA. He had to flee Belize after hiring a man to murder an American who was living in Belize. *Allegedly* of course...
$C: True story.  My coworker ran into him at Def-Con in Vegas last year.  He was out of it and enjoying a hoagie.
$C: Not sure if you knew about his trial when you wrote this, but it won.
$C: he's started some bitcoin mining company now. lmao.

MGT Capital Investments Inc. now trading at $3.6 a share.
$C: My mother-in-law is like this. The computer pops up and plays a commercial on the desktop every so often, and she's convinced that's normal.
$C: What anti virus did you use btw? I just got a new laptop and went with avg because that's what i always used in the past, but i have no idea if it's actually any good
$C: I have to say, webroot is throwing me for a loop.  It just sits there and only bothers you if something is wrong.  
$C: Was in Belize, got accused of murdering his (fellow American expat) neighbour. Fled to Guatemala. Got caught there. Somehow avoided extradition back to Belize, got deported to the US, whereupon the Belize police dropped the case. 

He actually ran for president as a Libertarian in 2016. 

I imagine the cocaine and hookers thing is true though. 
$C: from his videos hat seems accurate 
$C: Whatever you do, don't look into his interest in hammocks.
$C: A movie is being made about him apparently.

$C: Bneaky Sucking Fullshit*
$C: Assholism
$C: aka ajit pai
$C: Yeah. Learn your scientific terminology, guys.
$C: I always heard people use the term "Reason To Get Adblock"
$C: I was really hoping that Subreddit was something else...
$C: Thanks this is why I love Reddit so many great subs.
$C: Probably not, but the website that is responsible for the sneaky bullshit gets the ad click that way. 
$C: That is why banner ads are typically pay per impression rather than pay per click. 
$C: Sounds like a term that would exist in astrophysics. Almost seems....arrogant?....to coin the phrase for shitty advertising techniques. 
$C: [They're called dark patterns](https://youtu.be/e8r47hZX2G8)
$C: Clickjacking is more of a redirection attack, like an ad on Facebook taking you to a pseudo-Facebook login page.  Although misleading download links etc. are similar.
$C: Google and other Ad networks should be flagging them because it basically amounts to fraud.
$C: The cashier scanning something wasn't a great example. Clicking an ad doesn't cost you anything. However I have been on sites that literally won't let me navigate them because the ads are so aggressive and in your face, so your second example works
$C: are you equating spending actual money vs 3.5 seconds of your time spent clicking out of a window that came up?

not that i disagree, but that is the most ridiculous analogy lol
$C: > So why is it okay to do online?

Because advertisers are mega corporations who own our law makers...and therefor do not allow legislation that would unfuck their shitty business practices. 
$C: Because somehow all that free content on the internet needs to get paid for - at least at the grocery store you're buying something (usually). If everyone was cool for paying a few bucks to access each site individually then ads would go away no problem. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Everything does this, mobile stuf more than desktop
$C: Huh? I thought Native advertising was more like stuff that truly appears to be content (the entire time, not just initially) but is actually paid promotion. 

Like a "top 10 cleaning items" blog post which feutures a buncha Lysol products or YouTube/tv show which has a character drinking Coke. 

It's still deceptive in a way but much more subniminal than what this discussion is about, Native ads should not leave you with a "aw shit you fooled me damn it, this is not what I wanted" feeing at any point. 
$C: There‚Äôs a pop up ad on some dating apps where the company is called Cross Games and the logo is a little X.. in the upper corner... they knew what they were doing 
$C: Reddit does this too. Especially on the mobile app that they try to force you to download when you're browsing just the site on mobile (get Baconreader btw).

Reddit always has these ads mixed in with all the submissions.
$C: ALL advertisement is deceptive to some degree.
$C: This is the real answer folks

$C: Harvey Dent, can we trust him?
$C: Sometimes you actually don't know how large the ad is ahead of time, or even whether there will be an ad. Websites need to design with these factors in mind, but sadly most take the lazy path.

Source: I work on ad serving, and used to work on the JS code which loads ads for a large ad network.
$C: That's right.  They work hard at being the worst; it's important to give them credit where it's due
$C: Bill hicks said it best https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvp97SMZc6M
$C: Congratulations.
$C: I pirated it because it used to be free anyways. They didn't add any features, they just took some away and put them under a paywall, added ads, then converted the full "old" version to a paid version.

Fuck all the mobile apps that do that shit.
$C: sure we do, that's why there has been a shift to use programs such as adblock or ublock etc. 
$C: I dont get it
$C: Don't you just end up with a hundred pop-ups from the clicks?

That was probably the lowest bidder. 
$C: It was Nedry.
$C: They probably got approved for $20 million in funding and then pulled something like:
*My grandson knows the internet, we can just pay him $100 000 to do it and then funnel the rest elsewhere!*
$C: They didn't pay an actual designer obviously 
$C: Pretty much, or grouped to the type of warning, type of disaster, fully clear, large, buttons, coloured by type then tests or real.  There's no clear reason why it can't be as a clear interface of textual buttons, or even a confirmation prompt.  

Otherwise, there maybe reason it's just hyperlinks

>the errant employee actually was working with a drop-down menu on a computer program, from which the official chose the wrong item

Sure it wasn't an "html button" or even a analog button, but that's pretty common computer speak when you click the wrong thing. Not to mention the article says drop-down menu, yet the screenshot just looks like a bunch of links. 


$C: Holy shit anyone with a week of HTML/css experience could do better
$C: holy shit i will never understand how the government spends so much, and is so outdated when it comes to interfaces and services.

It probably took a hundred thousand $, and multiple hard code changes to add that new option on there. Why isn't there quick option to send a custom message, so they could immediately send a second alert saying "disregard previous alert"... because whoever is contracting tells them it can't be dynamic, they need to hard code each menu item.
$C: As well as a new UI...
$C: I kinda sorta understand now why my parents weren't comfortable with me watching that when I was seven. If I was a parent who grew up in the 60s, that shit would worry the fuck out of me. I don't think children's programming had ever been that morbid and disturbing until that point. Matter of fact, I can't imagine that show on daytime Nickelodeon these days. What the hell were people smoking in the 90s?
$C: Ren & Stimpy.
$C: Tell me about it. Had a similar problem back in 83, luckily my boy Stan had my back and resolved the whole thing.
$C: They're still paying a 60$/month magazine subscription because they didn't read the terms carefully
$C: Did you win?
$C: There's no way that is accidental. Which is what makes it so obnoxious. They're literally taking time out of your day by doing some sneaky programming to advertise to you. 
$C: Sure bb. Then we can both have affairs, get into fights with the people we‚Äôre seeing, realize we were cheating on each other, divorce, fuck each other‚Äôs siblings and marry them. 
$C: ....what extension? I have a similar problem but too many extensions.
$C: Delete them all
$C: Or don't fucking set the ok button in focus when giving an important pop up. Yeah, the button that gets "clicked" by pressing space when it's in focus. Like the regular action when you fucking WRITE something. Thanks for nothing Microsoft. 

/rant
$C: Me too thanks
$C: [deleted]
$C: Oh! Nailed it.
$C: This is a good idea
$C: Normally it's because it's a button that has the same name, e.g. "Download". You go to a page and there's at least 4 of them, at least one is real (if you're lucky). 
$C: Grasping for things to blame I thought that and tried three devices. I get around 320ms on each... This is why I suck at video games.
$C: Okay, I see what you mean. Such a plug-in could then make you play a short click based  mini game at browser startup to determine your reaction time and synch to your biorhythm.  
And maybe an option of *before/after first coffee of the day* üòä

$C: We see that you're disabling javascript. Please enable it to access our website.
$C: Except for all the sites that use javascript to load and layout their content. I used to block javascript by default, but so much of the web is unusable.
$C: Well, that's not going to offend them if the site is truly run by ad money. They are losing your money either way.
$C: It usually is a redirect, not just overlay
$C: I will try that next time
$C: The bigger companies make their money through other means and the smaller guys aren't collected enough to lobby. But I'm surprised YouTube has been allowing adblocker for as long as they have. Especially considering their main income is selling ad space.
$C: Welcome back
$C: Calm down... you‚Äôre freaking out about Reddit. Oh and karmacourt isn‚Äôt a real place.
$C: That makes no difference. You don't have to credit original posts at all. The crossposting feature is optional. It didn't even exist on Reddit until like the past year or so. Stop acting like this is a huge deal man. You're overreacting like crazy and feeding the people that don't understand how Reddit works. That's why you're getting all these downvotes. Chill out. 
$C: Not everyone's subscribed to /r/ProgrammerHumor and not everyone goes to /r/all.
$C: I guess I understand you reasoning, but:

You're already double gilded..

If you want the mods to delete it.. why not just do it yourself?
$C: It did blow up, you stole all the credit from him. 
$C: Don't delete it, it's a gif on a website. 
$C: Don't worry about it man, just in the future giving credit should be the first thing you do after posting. It just looks bad because you only gave credit here *after* others pointed out it's not yours.
$C: TIFU post?
$C: Seriously? There's a significantly larger audience for r/funny that there is for r/programmerhumor

Edit: there's almost half a million for programmer humor subreddit. Then for funny, there is 18 million +. All op, did was bring it to a much much larger audience.

$C: I don't mind static ads, some of the stuff can be quite interesting, but yeah, I'm getting that way when it comes to the websites that act arrogant and entitled over them.
$C: I'm afraid it is, I read all sorts of news sites but the left wing sites, possibly because of how utterly unpopular they're becoming have resorted to adblock popup windows and begging notifications or alternatively they use subscription popups.

The rest of them just seem to be locking everything behind a paywall.
$C: I disabled ABP to read a Forbes article one time, and some ad on their site hijacked my browser and tried to get me to download and install malware.  Never again.

There's nothing on the Forbes website that I want to read that badly.

$C: Adblockers truly are the condoms of the internet.

$C: Oh shit that's him! What's that from? This looks familiar!
$C: Wow, just looked up his twitter and damn. I guess that means i'm too late to ride this scam-wave
$C: Also he's broke
$C: how'd he lose it?
$C: Holy shit. He like Tony Stark before the first IM movie. 
$C: He got the boot after they found out he was on the lam from Belize and they shipped him back to the US. In Miami he met a hooker he paid with $5 bills and now they‚Äôre married, living in Mexico. 
$C: Well the Belize police did drop the case after he was back in the US. 
$C: It seems crazy but they're in their 60s and not great with computers anyway, and have had the same one for like 9 years before this, so if it looked / acted different they assumed something was wrong.

Oh well.
$C: Holy shit my dad's computer does this, and I keep meaning to getting around to figuring out the source. Like computer will pop out of standby to start playing an ad over dinner and he's like yeah, no way to fix that unfortunately.

Definitely pays for Norton or McAfee or some other cancerous adblocker
$C: Good AVs should come with a Grandma Mode that just periodically generates a popup to remind the user it still exists and still works. 
$C: The annoying bit is, if it was an Android phone, it *would* be normal in many cases....
$C: Windows 10 comes with Windows Defender which is more than enough for what they do on the computer.

They check e-mail, my dad checks sports scores, and my mom goes on e-bay once in a blue moon.  They're not torrenting or anything so I took McAfee (came on the system) off and just let Defender do its thing.
$C: Yeah, I know. What I meant was considering how many upgrades, tweaks and/or changes the software has gotten it's most likely not even remotely the same software McAfee sell off.

Thought I don't use McAfee AV (nor do I have any desire to) so I don't know if there has been any significant change with it over the years.

$C: Looks at how much traffic we are driving!
$C: Yea, *now* it's usually that way. There's still a lot of older "per click" advertising out there, though (I think... it's been a while, but I still hear things).
$C: Google and yahoo also use clickjacking but people don't complain much because there is nothing that can be done to stop it.

If you want to see it in action, do a google search and then click somewhere on the page and you'll notice that all the links on the page are changed to google redirector links.
$C: They do. Reputable networks are very strict about this. With Google it's account freeze for the first time and a  lifetime ban for the second.
$C: I'm pretty sure Google used to do this sort of trickery. They still might. I don't use Google enough now to tell.
$C: Pretty sure Google used to do this themselves (if they've stopped) with Youtube.
$C: >The cashier scanning something wasn't a great example.

Yeah, I realized that after I wrote it. Though, they can cause other problems, like viruses.
$C: The first example is bad. The second is accurate.
$C: See, I have no problem with ads- seriously. Unlike a lot of people, they don't bother me. What does bother me are ads that take complete control of my browser, or make it difficult to use the site I'm on.
$C: Actually, yes. The government *can* over-regulate things, but some amount of regulation is good for the consumer. *The Jungle* should be required reading. See what things look like without any regulation.
$C: Yeah I don't even browse the Internet on my phone anymore because of it.
$C: Mobile sites are pure fucking radioactive cancer. Somehow when I use adblockers on my phone, it only manages to lessen the cancer by about 50%, while on my desktop if eliminates 99% of it. Mobile sites are barely usable with ad blockers and they are completely useless without. Also, why the fuck is EVERY local new site's mobile version basically no different than a porn site when it comes to ads?
$C: ^ This is correct. Native advertising is basically just covertly sponsored content.
$C: They always know what they‚Äôre doing
$C: Way to helpful for /r/LifeProTips
$C: It‚Äôs not showing up for me
$C: We still can't completely avoid it.  Let's say I have an ad slot that is 920px wide.  When programmatic fills, that could be 60px, 90px, 250px tall - don't know.  So we can build 60 since that's most common, but there's still gonna be a jump for a lot of users.  If we restrict the slot size, we get less fill and lower bids which equal less money.  I wish there was a better way, but for many of is devs, our hands are tied.  Not to mention a lot of programmatic ads are hot fucking garbage and take forever to load because it loads like 10MB of shit and 300 3rd party tags.  

TL;DR: webdev wishes there was a better way too.
$C: The first and worst sin is deciding to go into advertising voluntarily.

also it was a combination of adblock plugin, and the thaad system

i.e yellow background = drill, and red background = shit is going down. 
$C: >  large, buttons

Yeah, these should definitely be buttons. Links go somewhere, buttons do something. A link that performs an action (rather than simply navigating to a page) is bad UX.

$C: As stupid as it sounds, this was actually a thing in the late 90s for radars - the ones that detect speeding cars. Radars send out a ping and objects reflect this. Radar detectors detect the ping and tell you about it happening. Radar detector detectors notice that there's an anomaly responding specifically to its wavelength and tell the radar operator that there's somebody with a radar detector (which is illegal in many countries). So somebody invented a radar detector detector detector, which detects the radar detector detector in much the same way that it detects the radar detector, turning off the radar detector before the radar detector detector has a chance to detect it. See also the Wikipedia article on [Radar detectors, subheading Radar detector detectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_detector#Radar_detector_detectors).

$C: Well I am a programmer and was making fun of other programmers. Only a programmer would think that is a good design.
$C: The only reason they‚Äôre trying to ‚Äòfix‚Äô this problem is because they do this test alarm extremely frequently and a false alarm can result in the loss of lives, rioting, and mass panic. The test, if I remember correctly, is performed with every shift change. That‚Äôs insanely frequent, a false alarm creating mass hysteria was bound to happen eventually.
$C: Except that one time
$C: The content of Forbes is really bad too. Twice in two months they posted articles about my industry, NLP, and they expanded the acronym of the industry's name wrong. 

The article is about Natural Language Processing (a scientific discipline concerning machine understanding of human language), but the headline says "Neuro-Linguistic Programming" (some hippie bullshit about saying magic words to make you feel happy). 

I and several of my colleagues have sent letters to the editor about this a year ago, they are still not fixed. 

Makes me think twice about handing people my business cards.

Don't read Forbes, people. They spoke directly to Andrew Ng, the father of deep learning NLP, and couldn't get his job title right. There's no telling what else they get wrong about fields I'm not an expert in. 
$C: Me too but when I finally read the article it was total crap NEVER again

$C: But wait, it's still somehow expected that this shit happens. When I go to youtube from my desktop and click on some channel I want to click on the videos tab as soon as I get there, so I can skip the autoplaying crap. And I still can't click it because this fucking shit happens. On my fucking i7, what, it can't render the crappy page? I mean.. Man it's good these people still don't make cars, youd have to steer with your left nostril with a lag of 20 seconds.

$C: But the developers who peppered the ads like they were trying to choke a bitch with their dish get the money too... Although a website with a fair amount of ads is ok to use this on.
$C: Wow dude. You made them use some of the bandwidth they were already going to pay for. That's like buying thousands of stamps and sending *empty letters* with them to make the postal service do fruitless labor!
$C: I think this system might be counterproductive. All this does is encourage the site hosts to find and sell more advertising slots, because their ads are getting so many clicks. And they are getting revenue. It's actually really hard to track clicks to direct revenue for the people advertising, so they might not make the connection that these are fake clicks.

If you want to stop ads, stop the people hosting them, not the people who want to advertise. 
$C: I like it because it makes some people who probably worked hard on their content/website/etc get some money.

$C: Everyone jumps on people about karma but how many of you would actually go and upvote the original if the xpost was credited, don't even answer, just honestly ask yourself, if you weren't being asked this and it mentioned it the title it was an xpost would you seek it out and upvote it? get real man, 99% of people wouldn't give the slightest shit and would never even look at the original posters name, then people go on to say "who even cares about karma" and at the same time "fuck OP for taking this dudes karma" the hypocrisy is just insane

Don't get me wrong, stealing without credit isn't cool, but there's so much hypocrisy here its ridiculous
$C: It's not about that for me, it would be nice to know where it was originally posted.
$C: Also the people complaining about reposts, those people always sound like they care too much about karma, even more than OP.

If karma is so meaningless why do they care if someone is getting too much with reposts?
$C: Oh yeah? Then why did you post that comment three times? I can only assume it was for more karma. 
$C: Put the pitch forks away boys.
$C: You mean C++?  
 \*badum tzz\*
$C: That‚Äôs funny but what likely happened is more sinister. And that is a firm which damn well knows this is shoddy work charged an obscene amount of money for it. It‚Äôs almost comical. Only a few lines of code would allow for a notifier to ask you if you‚Äôre *really* sure you want to cause state wide panic. Tax dollars at work folks.
$C: Lucky, I only got a C# 
$C: its because companies hire programmers with the intelegence equivalent to highschoolers
$C: I guess this how I am confused how this could happened 
$C: Does the drill one also have a confirm message?
$C: In the actual system they use Comic Sans
$C: >An actual image can‚Äôt be released ‚Äúfor security reasons,‚Äù

PR speak for "Our system actually looks way worse than this"
$C: I'm doing a boot camp right now and literally just learned to make boxes last night, government if you're reading this I'll be waiting for my job offer
$C: Just have to add more adds above then below then your Android has a virus. Fuck it. Let it burn. 
$C: Stay woke, fam.

Also, Castro was not your friend.
$C: You wouldn't believe how I lost my job working at Chernobyl.
$C: > They've resolved it by moving the login text boxes.

Ah, okay. Good on them. That was kind of my basis for saying it was intentional and shady; they could have easily moved the location of the login area and/or the ad. 
$C: Ready for a failed marriage 
$C: God damn, and they say romance is dead
$C: My brother is 12 so yeah 
$C: uBlock zapper here we come!
$C: You're welco.. waaaaait a minute... you're not OP!
$C: ZOOP
$C: I mean, it doesn't really seem like you're that mixed on this
$C: Hmm yeah can't argue with that. 
$C: That one time though was my first experience with their site *sans* ABP.  I guess what I should clarify then is that there's nothing on the Forbes website that I want to read badly enough that I would willingly disable ABP again to visit their site.

It was also a few years back.  I can only imagine what a hellscape of terrible monetized design flaws it is now.
$C: To be fair, not theirs either
$C: Works for me ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
$C: Sometimes
$C: Hahaha, I see you are trying to *block* me, [yessss?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYZAnn6gPak)
$C: Damn, Westcoast Custom dunnit again
$C: I have it. There are still scripts that block it, and unless you know what to specifically look for (or are willing to block all scripts) an anti-adblock blocker is needed for some select sites. 
$C: try to install nano defender with u block, and set u block in a medium mode it's really usefull 
$C: your hacker is right, ublock origin is made by the original developer
$C: Try [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock). I use it, and it works fine.
$C: In ublock origin, when I got the notice telling me to disable adblocker, allowed it ‚Äòjust for this page‚Äô. 
$C: John McAfee has gone straight wild. i was scanning Netflix and saw the documentary on him - "Gringo" [Source Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjBgNwAVLWQ)

tl;dw he moved to an impoverished small nation in Central America and corrupted it to his will. harems, drugs, corrupt police, armed enforcers, *murder*, extradition and on and on

the documentary is actually really good. 
$C: Here ya go!
https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=91s&v=bKgf5PaBzyg
$C: I swear, McAfee is the worst Anti-virus program ever. I still remember my mom installing it only for it to have a virus for it to show "Hey look, your PC had a virus. Good thing I'm here now." Never again. I just stick to Microsoft Security Essentials and Malwarebytes
$C: This was in Belize, and McAfee accused corrupt local officials for setting him up because he didn't pay some sort of protection money.  McAfee fled the country and made it back into the US, and Belize dropped the case, though McAfee offered to talk to Belize police on US soil.
$C: That's when you call John Wick
$C: he also likes girls to poop in his mouth
$C: I dunno. His eyes have that "thousand-yard-stare" of "is ... is this really all there is?"

Even hookers and coke and guns get boring if you do it every day.
$C: McBound and Down, season 2. 
$C: I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs made serious bank (millions) by pumping and dumping bad alt coins. 
$C: Apparently, there were several reports in 2014 that he was broke
$C: I work in education and would love to see a study done about learning styles of older people using computers as the vehicle of learning.  I think it would be fascinating.  We know so much about how the brains of young people develop and how they learn, would love to know why these issues occur for older folks.
$C: In apps, also. Including lock screen ads.
$C: > Who's Sneaky?

NA's only hope





for dank memes.
$C: Sorry, that was me - I meant to click the "close gates and kick Sneaky out forever", but one of those sneaky fucking ads popped up so I accidentally pressed "open the gates to the manure and let Sneaky in".
$C: Sneaky is a well-known ADC player for the LoL team of C9 as well as a streamer
$C: !redditsilver
$C: Sneaky is a scrub. 
$C: Do you.. Do you know what that word means?
$C: Ugh then you've never been to r/enoughinternet (Warning: extremely nsfw and nsfl most of the time)
$C: For something equally weird. /r/offcenterbuttholes
$C: Nice username btw. 
$C: Someone mentioned it in a highly upvoted thread not too long ago as a reply to a top comment, I've been seeing it pop up a lot more since then. Though it could just be that I'm noticing it more.
$C: That type of asshole lacks the Cheerio. There's just a tiny hole with rays shining from it.
$C: Adobe analytics can do some impressive things.
$C: Intelligence Collection Agency*

Don't be evil! :\^)
$C: Their customers (i.e. advertisers) use up their allotted # of click-throughs faster.
$C: I do this too but sometimes it seems the adds have a sixth sense for when I think I've waited enough.
$C: Exactly. 
$C: Everyone wants something for free. Textra was only $1.99 when I bought it. I find it worth it for that low price. People just don't build and maintain apps without being compensated.
$C: You're thinking about it incorrectly. When it was completely free, it was subsidized. The goal was to turn a profit eventually.
$C: if the users disable the ad blocker, then they won

if all sites do this, we don't really have other sites to go
$C: Yeah but why would you want to block that tho ^^^^^^^^^^^^/s
$C: Unless you get the SPF 9000 rating one. 
$C: It's a different terminalogy.
$C: The cursor shaking at the end seems like it's saying "no no no no.. !!! Take it back take it back !"
$C: I thought it was Theater, not Terminal.
$C: I though it was theatre.  Got the rest right so meh
$C: Thermal sounds more awesome. Blow up a thermal nuclear missile with a thermal one.

I also mix words. But my thoughts are correct? Yah?
$C: I've heard it both ways
$C: Therminal. Now everyone can be happy.
$C: [removed]
$C: You‚Äôre probably right, anti ballistic missile systems are notoriously unreliable as it‚Äôs not a simple task
$C: Hey, sometimes the THAAD missiles managed to get off the ground in testing.
$C: Thaad has nothing to do with EMS. It's probably in a sub on the west coast. 
$C: Kinda. Its like a spin-off. "Galaxy Fight"
$C: Lol when I was little I remember people occasionally protesting "NO STAR WARS" outside Vandenberg AFB. I was like "mom, why do they hate Star Wars?!"
$C: He's a Russian trying to make his countrymen feel better about themselves
$C: Yeah but it doesn't actually turn into revenue via a product purchased. Ads don't actually make money when they don't convert into sales. So, the advertisers lose money when companies pull their ads when nothing is making sales.
$C: And also sometimes I want to visit a website but avoid giving them a cent, like the Daily Mail
$C: exactly :)
$C: Except I WANT to support most websites, its the actual ads i dislike.
$C: it's not for that point, it's so the system has no idea what your interests are and fails to understand what you are interested in. Which would slowly lead to a incoherent crash in there system since they cant prove what you actually like. People wont pay for random info and ads will slowly become worthless. 
$C: I'm not a bot wtf

And I'm still here
$C: Oh no. What happened to him? 
$C: He just replied to a comment of mine a few days ago, he ain't gone!
$C: [deleted]
$C: The Euro model is sharper and can easily puncture the internal organs of the lynchee (is that a word?) 
$C: But reddit now has a built in xpost feature...
$C: On r/programmerhumor, should be easy to find.
$C: I used to hate reposts, but i realised that when i see a user's profile i couldn't care less whether they have 30 karma or 30 million. It's really just a personal measure of how many people enjoy your content, reposting only invalidates it for yourself.
$C: I'm assuming dude is on mobile, if so, the app fucks up quite a bit and will triple post shit.
$C: I don't get why people do this, nobody cares or even bothers to look at your karma score besides you...
$C: Once the pitch forks are out they can't be put away before drawing OP blood.
$C: I can play a C# on my guitar!
$C: Can confirm... I work for a company that is contracted by government agencies and half the functional code is written in plsql. We have one application that processes data and it is scaled by opening up like 100 different Windows terminals and adding more if it slows down. Each process is run by a batch script that calls the program in a loop. The application had many bugs which were "fixed" by putting VB Script into the bash script. Also each process open a new database connection.. I tried to fix it by adding actual threading in a single process that runs continuously with a database connection pool... They never used it. This is my first job in software and I gaurantee you that I am better than at least 80 percent of the people there and almost all of them get paid more than me... Also I am not bragging, I am just trying to demonstrate how shitty everyone else is. I would prefer if there were more people to learn from. Most of them are shocked/impressed that I know more than one programming language. I had to show a system admin how to perform an operation with a single rsync command to copy files instead of the 80,000 lines of rsync commands he was using so that I could finish my task sometime that month (not exaggerating)
$C: At this point I welcome the nukes. 
$C: You a mate of nsa chatbot? 
$C: I don't know what you're talking about, back in 86 I was working at Chernobyl. I made a bet with my buddy Gustav that he couldn't come up with a more efficient way to cool the reactors. I told him the only rule was he had to get it done by the time I got back from my 2 week vacation in Moscow. I hear the next day our boss had a literal meltdown. Never came back from vacation.

$C: LPT: When getting cockblocked on Forbes, instead of disabling ABP, use google webcache instead.

Here, take this: http://cachedview.com

Often works with WSJ cockblock too.

And when you do that on reddit, be kind and post the full article mirror on the comment section.

There should be a bot that automates this for all news content.


#NEVER

# DISABLE

# ADBLOCK

EDIT: Bonus LPT - Disable Javascript on your browser, and ONLY whitelist primary sites that you can't live without.

EDIT2: Well, technically speaking you won't die without the internet, but still.

EDIT3: Bonus LPT2 - If you feel adblocking deprives your content creator of their "well-deserved" ad revenue, use [adnauseam](https://adnauseam.io) as your adblocker. It's a ublock origin fork that clicks on the ads that gets blocked instead of merely just blocking them. This means you don't get cancer, but the content creator gets their ad revenue, while showing to the advertiser that their ads are being clicked on the site, therefore enticing them to place more ads.
$C: you think that is bad, try downloading something from CNET.  there are like 7-10 different green download buttons.
$C: Ad revenue. It is their loss.
$C: I don't share Forbes articles, increase their readership, click on their links, discuss their articles (except now), or engage with their social media.

Are you sure it's not their loss?
$C: I have never seen this shtoyle before
$C: good 2 know thanks!
$C: Holy shit. I thought the picture posted was just some stupid joke or like a movie character. And then he ran for president?!

Edit: after watching actual video the pic is from it was kind of a joke. 
$C: So... uh... living the dream? I kid I kid...
$C: OMG is that really him?
$C: The Malware Removal Tool that runs alongside Windows Defender (MSE revamped) is pretty great. I wouldn't step outside of the free Windows offerings if someone paid me.
$C: And that's why rich people don't leave the country regardless of tax rates.
$C: When talking to Belize police, "Oh I'm sorry about that.  I'll pay the fine right now.  Is cash okay?  I don't need a receipt." 
$C: yeah it was crazy, he did kill his neighbor I think and was on the run for a while and he seemed strung out and erratic, and then, everything was fine.  I was just too lazy to look up the follow up to see why nobody seems to care that he killed a dude.
$C: What.
$C: The picture is actually from a spoof tutorial he made about how to uninstall mcafee. It is over the top and meant as a total joke. 
$C: He's definitely not anymore
$C: Also they learned differently. They learned facts. You memorized the multiplication table just like you memorized everything else.  
Younger generations are taught not to memorize, but instead how to find information.  
But that's just my 2 cents.
$C: I'm 47.  Have had computers since the 80s.  Ran a bbs on my c64.  Ever since WINDOWS went to them tiles instead of a "click through a tree of subfolders, I've given up.  Xp was the last I was a pc enthusiast.  That ui doesn't work with my brain.
$C: From my own experience, it's heavily based on prior experiences...

Working at a photolab we had a PC customers could use to manually order photos if the kiosk was down... The Windows installation borked one day so as a short-term solution (which wound up being long-term) I threw on Ubuntu Linux.

Those that had very little prior experience to PC's had little issue, I'd show them how to open windows for the thumb drive / CD and for the order folder (which I created) and showed them how to copy them over... and for those with little PC experience this made sense to them, they could understand it readily.  So you had a significant number of seniors using Ubuntu Linux without issue.

Those that had spent years on Windows or Mac had a *much* harder time adjusting. 

I'm suspicious that my early years of PC usage have made me much more flexible with OS's than even most my age... I grew up on DOS, followed by OS/2, with Windows 3.1 running ontop, to OS/2 Warp! with Win 95 running on it, then Windows 98 for a couple years before switching to Linux, then dual-booting Windows and Linux.  Most of the time I completely forget what OS I'm in.

But if I run into a Mac... one I have no prior experience in... I'm lost.

$C: The world likely didn't change much for an individual up until the information age. They're not geared mentally for it.

Also, technology didn't used to be "play with it till it works". It used to be ingrained in people not to mess with tech unless they understood it or they might break a VERY expensive piece of machinery.

(Total guesses. No hard science to back that up) I work in tech  and found for my older users, if I repeat over and over that there is absolutely nothing they can damage permanently, they're usually better than the Young folks at picking up new software. I also add that if they do manage to permanently damage something I'll personally hire them to be on the stress-testing team. Ha
$C: Star guardian urgot model
$C: Got eem!
$C: He's fucking ads too?
$C: This is the definition of "fucking gross"
$C: What the fuck, what in the actual fucking fuck
$C: Yeah, that's staying blue.
$C: It took me going through a few threads to get it. 

Never really thought about it really. 

Are there girls out there with perfectly centered butt holes? 
$C: Thats the thread! Now im seeing it more often. 
$C: You are correct. So can google analytics or sorts of data warehouse type of analysis. 

The average page built for the average shit show site that does this isn't looking that deep.

Though ESPN, Forbes, and other major publications do this too so the question would then shift to *why*? Allowing ads to subvert your CSS is lazy but may also pay better per consumption. 
$C: Yeah, seriously, Sequoia Capital and whatever, been years since I took a hard look.  I mean, 99% of their revenue is from advertising, who knows what the fuck else they're doing with the data.
$C: [deleted]
$C: it's like adblock but thaaadblock - actually a really witty, clever joke
$C: Dog, I just tried to wipe that '/s' off my screen...
$C: *9001
$C: It used to be theater but it changed.
$C: Who‚Äôs life?
$C: That's indeed right. They pay per ad view and they don't get sales thus no profit. This is for the ad creating/selling company.

 But the idea of littering ads all over the site/app is a horrible UX decision which should not warrant the developers getting more money. Keep that moderate or have an consented ad viewing experience where the user might get some artificial status on the site/app for it.
$C: So this is hurting the actual company higher up the chain rather than the...say, webmaster hosting the ad on their site?
$C: YES. I TOO AM NOT A ROBOT.
$C: It's like you can almost still hear him.. RIP
$C: I'm sorry, I wasn't sure if you used a bot for those pastas, I just didn't see them so commonly anymore as I used to so I assumed something was going on and a while back i saw some thread stating something about you being banned. 

Anyway, good work, really enjoy it!
$C: I'm sorry, sir. The people have spoken: you're a bot.
$C: I‚Äôm sorry for your loss
$C: its like i can still hear his angelic voice selling me pitchforks
$C: lmao, sure. 
$C: Good bot.
$C: Spoken like a true bot.
$C: lol, yeah right, yes you are!
$C: And not dead, even!
$C: Oh man I thought you were gone, I just see everyone taking your copypasta and running with it. Good to see you're still here!
$C: r/beetlejuicing
$C: I am a bot. Fuck you for being an entitled human.
$C: That's exactly what a bot would say. 
$C: I'm guessing they got forked
$C: Don't worry, he's still active on Reddit. Just not posting his famous pitchfork emporium comments anymore or atleast not as frequent as he used to.
$C: The pitchfork thing seems harmless enough...

But then you get to the end and see "Happy Lynching!"...

Which is sort of like throwing in a reference to gas chambers and ovens.
$C: No but (correct me if I'm wrong) he stopped posting this pitchfork comments. Or at least not so frequent anymore. He's still active on Reddit tho.
$C: you mention him and he responds with some great offerings on pitchforks!
$C: YOU CANT HANDLE THE TRUTH

Sorry not the time 
$C: You speak truth, am on mobile. Sorry if i commented this multiple times, didn't even realise that could happen...

^(but it was obviously me karmawhoring /s)

I'll try to delete the extras.
$C: I'm scared of knives so I can only play c flat
$C: Oh also.. the funniest thing about that application is that at the end of the loop it sleeps for like 7 seconds before forming a new process... So worse case scenario all of the processes could theoretically be sleeping at the same time. This was to make sure they "don't step on each other's toes".. Also it was written by a system architect.. I am pretty sure the guy makes like 10 times my salary
$C: No, but I have taunted that person on more than one occasion.
$C: Kinda mild
$C: Wait you don‚Äôt have a hot sister?!
$C: New phone, who dis?
$C: I don't think I've visited CNET since 1998.
$C: Just over over it and you can see what the link goes to at the bottom of the screen
$C: Not if he has an ad blocker on
$C: Yup.  I get a Forbes link, they ask me to turn off my adblockers, I close the tab.  Its true they're not getting ad revenue from me either way, but now I'm not trying their article, sharing it, discussing it, etc.  My reading it wouldn't have cost them anything, and may have drawn more non adblockers viewers.

Hell, these days I see a Forbes link, I don't even bother clicking it in the first place.  Whatever works for them, though.
$C: Why kid? He definitely is 
$C: Lol yup!
$C: Oh I assure you they would leave as soon as the tax rates are equal to or higher than other developed nations.

I mean at least in Nordic Europe your tax dollars are spent relatively efficiently.  Culturally diverse countries with huge populations and land like the US will always struggle with spending efficiently.  There are much better places to go if you're going to have to lose half of you income to taxes.
$C: > And that's why rich people don't leave the country regardless of tax rates.

Many of the world's rich [disagree with you](https://www.google.com.eg/search?q=rich+fleeing+china&oq=rich+fleeing+china&aqs=chrome..69i57.2374j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). 
$C: It isn't really clear whether he fled because he was guilty or if he fled because he was paranoid.  Belize police wanted to talk to him, and believed they had a plausible motive, but it's simply not clear whether there was any physical evidence to tie McAfee to the crime.
$C: Picture may be a spoof, but sources say he's quite a bit unhinged from reality:  http://abcnews.go.com/US/rise-fall-rise-john-mcafee-tech-pioneer-person/story?id=47346015
$C: Apart from your exams. You had to memorise useless shit for exams. Your use of memorize makes me believe you're American? Not sure how the exam system is out there, but in the, UK, a lot was remembering not finding.
$C: Really has little to do with it and there's no basis for that in research.

The idiom "can't teach an old dog new tricks" has a kernel of truth. As we get older, how we learn drastically changes. How a 5 year old learns and how a 70 year old learns is different. How their brain develops links and works also changes. You will become the same way when you get older. Of course, it varies among individuals.
$C: Medical students will disagree with this. It's memorization instead of quantitative.
$C: I'm 45 and in a similar boat. I can't stand that Windows 10 tile interface BS. The telemetry and OS ads don't help either. If I didn't have to use it for work, I would have stuck with MacOS, *nix, and Windows 7.
$C: My dad has the same issue.

And to be honest I did a Bootcamp partition on my iMac to run some windows programs (mostly games) and the tiles took me a while to figure out.
$C: I would agree, wife switched us to Mac (her work) at home right before Windows went to the tiles (I think 8?).

I put a bootcamp partition on it to run some old windows programs, put Windows 10 on, and was totally lost at first.
$C: In my experience with mac, do everything backwards. Flipped mouse direction still confuses me everytime. The only time I ever use mac is at school or college.
$C: And... he's out again. Sorry.
$C: Yeah and that, gross. 
$C: I clicked. Shows as advertised
$C: Generally i think most butholes are centered. Theres a few out there that appear to have wondered away.
$C: I'd hope so, I know I'd be kinda upset about my business being associated with distasteful advertising practices.

Still, "too low" is subjective, and not every business decision is a good one.
$C: He's saying you wouldn't want to block THAAD because it could save you.
$C: *9002
$C: Interesting, didn't know that. Thanks.
$C: Initially, but the companies will just find more effective methods of advertising. Beside, the typical companies that buy into such abusive advertising tactics tend to be the scammy type who don't need to exist anyway. "Your computer is infected with virus!!!1" ads can burn in hell.
$C: YES FELLOW HUMAN, LET US DRINK WATER BASED BEVERAGES TOGETHER IN A SOCIAL SETTING AS HUMANS DO
$C: Bad bot /s
$C: HELLO CAN ANYONE HEAR ME?

*distant sobbing*
$C: -----E<3
$C: WHAT DO YOU MEAN FELLOW HUMAN
$C: That's what a bot would say to a human to cover up the fact that he's a bot

So how do I know you're not a bot
$C: Yeah, it was pretty forked up to be honest.
$C: Mortar! Forker. 
$C: I was getting banned for spamming the copy pasta

So I just respond to summons of my username now!
$C: It isn't really the same thing IMO. We don't really have any cultural references to gas chambers and human ovens other than the holocaust, so referencing those things doesn't make any sense unless you're specifically trying to evoke holocaust imagery and/or a racial component.

Lynching has been around for thousands of years in many cultures. Long before even slave days, lynching was just what mobs did when they wanted to exact some mob justice. If Reddit was predominant used by Arab countries I'm sure it would be "Happy Stoning!", but here in this Eurocentric Reddit, we have lynching instead.
$C: I think he did stop with the pitchfork copypastas, yeah, but he's definitely still around

$C: >Nordic Europe

>As diverse as the US

Nordic countries have more Muslims, Latinos and other non-local populations by % of population than the US. In Sweden, for example, there are towns with 100% Muslim population.
$C: Well yeah of course they flee China. His point was that they don't flee the US.
$C: Yup, American.
$C: same in america. there is some finding but mostly memorizing
$C: Oh there's a lot of tests out here too. Lot's of memorization and regurgitating information
$C: Why does his use of memorize make you think he's American? Do UK use another word or spelling?
$C: I find myself already having spells of this honestly.

Windows 10 is a good example.  The tiles threw me off enough that I considered just deleting it and sticking with IOS.  And it struck me, that would be a very "my dad" thing to do.  

$C: FWIW this is why I dropped out of the med program early.

Too much memorization and my brain is 1000x better at problem solving than memorization.
$C: Yeah, it's a strange feeling when you feel lost in an OS you thought you knew pretty well.

Metro really muddied the waters for Windows users though... I have friends who won't even *try* Windows 10 because of Windows 8's Metro UI... They're sticking with XP.

The mind has an amazing ability to adapt though... Ever try reversing the mouse direction on an FPS game?  I did it once just to see if I could adapt, and I did...

It took a while, but I cludged through it and about 4 hours into the HL2 storyline I was getting headshots left and right with a reverse mouse.

Then I thought... "Hmmm, what happens if I switch it back to normal?"  I was absolutely horrified that I couldn't play "normally" anymore.. My mind in a few hours had managed to completely rewire itself... There appears to be no bilingual analog for this kind of thing.  So I shut it off and slept it off... woke up and was right as rain.

But it makes you realize... if you'd never used a mouse in an FPS game, you could've started either way and you'd never think of "your" way as reverse, regardless of which way it was.
$C: I think you can switch that.  Either way I actually threw the wireless mouse in the trash and hooked up a regular pc gaming mouse.

I'm a cheater.
$C: That's what I thought too and looking through that subreddit, the great majority of those seem pretty much centered to me as well. But they seem to have an especially sensitive bar for what is considered center, so I'm assuming there's some people that have this mythical perfectly center butthole.

$C: I get it but it's kinda reading too far into the joke
$C: I read it as THAAD is doing the blocking.
$C: when will you return to the pitchfork days
$C: r/totallynotrobots
$C: You mean as US humans do? You robot piece of shit?
$C: BLESSED ARE WE WHO BLEED RED! LET US CRUSH DRINKS IN A CELEBRATORY PROCEDURE!
$C: For like, 5 seconds there was a bot (I think u/bots-rise_up was the name) but the post was deleted...
$C: Guess its tine was up.
$C: He is ALIVE!
$C: Thanks for clearing this up!
$C: The issue here is that most Americans don't even know what **lynching** is. It is glossed over in American history books and classes.

Lynching isn't just an angry mob grabbing pitchforks and gently teasing/harassing "OP." The target of a lynch mob *dies*... usually after some form of gruesome torture. Torture is an integral part of lynching because a major point of lynching is to "send a message" (to individuals and communities). 

Were pitchforks used in lynchings? Sure. Probably. Many lynching victims were poked/stabbed/gouged while burning at the stake. A pitchfork is one way to accomplish that. 

If you don't believe me, check out the book "100 Years of Lynchings." It is literally just a compilation of (mostly American) newspaper clippings from 1860-1960, describing lynchings in detail. There is no commentary from the author... as the reports basically speak for themselves. One of the most surprising things to me was finding out just how many lynching victims were *burned to death.* A noose is too 'gentle' as a symbol for lynching. In fact, many times nooses were used more to keep victims *restrained* rather than to hang them.

See, I used to chuckle along with the pitchfork memes before I knew about lynching. I assume that most people going along with the pitchfork meme are doing so innocently. In past years I would have just ignored stuff like this. Unfortunately, though, white supremacy is surging in the United States... and the last thing Americans need to do is get back into the habit of lynching people. Even as an attempted joke/satire the whole pitchfork meme fails.

$C: Yes
$C: >by % of population

Yeah dude. Sweden's (highest pop) entire population is very roughly about 3% of the US's. Each individual non-white contributes a much greater amount to that percentage there.

You could say that means that the US doesn't take in enough immigrants or something, but I would assert that that would be extremely difficult to ascertain due to the radically different dynamics between the countries. And not just political ones, based just on logistical complications alone. Especially when the fact remains that *there are just a fucking lot of white people in the US*. Can't really be mad at them for just existing, diluting the percentage contributions.

>In Sweden, for example, there are towns with 100% Muslim population.

That is definitely something that could be said for the US too. Well, idk about Muslims, to be quite honest, but definitely a large selection of non-whites.

But yeah, you're just focusing on race/religion, anyway. America is diverse for a great many more reasons than a place like Sweden. Not saying either is any more or any less diverse than they should be, but it just makes sense based on the population proportions. Like it's a fucking mathematical impossibility to say Sweden even compares in that way, the population difference just could not possibly permit it. You have to focus on specific definitions with specific proportions to make a statement like that, then it would be wrong by default due to sampling bias.
$C: Us is 50 percent nonwhite
$C: They flee from France. Whose to say they wouldn't from the US?
$C: We utilise s in a lot of places they use z. Ie, utilise, initialize etc.
$C: Welp, at least in person ive never met one i didnt like so its interesting to view them from an educational perspective. An unbiased study of ass.
$C: actually, now that he mentioned that the joke has been unraveled and not really funny anymore.
$C: I think it needs further explanation with like diagrams and flow charts. Can someone do that for me? 
$C: [deleted]
$C: It's always the pitchfork days.
$C: HAHAHA VERY GOOD HUMOROUS JOKE FELLOW HUMAN

*nervous shaking*
$C: /r/thatsthejoke 
$C: I don't think a single person in this thread *didn't know* that lynchings involved killing the person being lynched. All of the information that you dumped here doesn't change the fact that lynchings were going on long before the late 1800's, and the imagery of an angry pitchfork and torch wielding mob is a cultural trope/meme that doesn't have a specific racial component *until you give it one*.

This is an example of going too far in the name of political correctness. Making a big deal about something as stupid as Reddit pitchforks for karma whoring seriously dilutes your message, and turns reasonable people into reactionaries. 
$C: Hot damn, the affair has started quicker than I thought...well I better go find me a hot sister...

$C: In sorry but you offended me, I will see you at the honour court. I hope the sentence entails stones.

*oh wait we're not in Sweden*
$C: Sweden is bomb percent nonwhite
$C: Rhett and Link should do an episode on this tbh. 

"Perfect buttholes of mythicallity, do they really exist? Let's talk about that." 
$C: Ah damn I broke it, sorry guys
$C: moral of the story: take the joke and run while you still can
$C: That's what happened when you explain a joke.
$C: I don't get it.
$C: I‚Äôve got a cousin :/
$C: I thought I replied but it was on mobile and so i guess it didn't work, hit the X where your refresh button will be once the words have loaded but not the pictures and stuff, stops the page from loading fully and should let you read freely.

$C: YouTube them. 
$C: smallest /s I've ever seen damn
$C: No, I was that, I mean why wouldn't you want ad block?
$C: I don't know any major website that intentionally gave any of their users viruses and I've been online for 20 years.  If there is one then it's not the norm.  I'd like to know how you expect server hosting costs to be paid, how you expect the people who create that content you enjoy (website designers, content creators, customer support people, and others) to put food on their table for their families.    Is it really that bad that you get a couple of ads?  Would you rather pay for every website you visit?  Without ads, and the potential for ad revenue the internet wouldn't exist today in the way you know it, and we ALL benefit from it.
$C: [removed]
$C: Well the money needs to be made one way or another or the websites wouldn't exist.  In a way ads were a mutual agreement between consumers and content creators.  It's a way to pay people to create content without paying for it.  When everyone started using adblocker they still needed money to pay people, and pay for hosting, so they have to come up with creative ways.  If one is to ask you to disable adblocker I'm not going to hate them for that.  What is interesting is how other websites are making money, they are probably  doing much sneakier things and you'd want your ads back.
