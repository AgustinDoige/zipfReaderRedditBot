If you would like to make a donation in his memory, the Stephen Hawking Foundation has [the Dignity Campaign](http://www.stephenhawkingfoundation.org/dignity-campaign/) to help buy adapted wheelchair equipment for people suffering from motor neuron diseases.  You could also consider donating to [the ALS Association](http://www.alsa.org/donate/) to support research into finding a cure for ALS and to provide support to ALS patients.
$C: i guess he did outlive his life expectancy by 60 years

$C: Woah. One of those deaths you always saw coming but still shocks you.
$C: “We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that, I am extremely grateful.” - Stephen Hawking

Rest In Peace to a man who in 1962 was only expected to live two more years. Thank you for giving me someone to look up to as a lost child and sharing your genius with the world. 

$C: “I have lived with the prospect of an early death for the last 49 years. I’m not afraid of death, but I’m in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first.”
RIP
$C: Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. 
It matters that you don't just give up.
$C: An absolutely monumental mind. The world mourns his loss. 
$C: A sad day for scientists and science enthusiasts around the world. He was instrumental in inspiring so many with a love for science. Even as someone in a totally unrelated field, Hawking was one of the people that made me excited about science as a kid. I'm sure I'm not the only one. Rest in peace.
$C: Very sad. Let's celebrate his life though, he had a good run for someone in his condition.
$C: [removed]
$C: pour one out for the OG wheelin and dealin, rubber pealin, physicist on the A-List. His body may be dismissed but his knowledge will persist
$C: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge." RIP.
$C: Legend. So sad to see him go
$C: Wow. Did this come out of nowhere?

$C: He was the person who got me interested is science. So sad to hear this news.
$C: It's a shame but, I think he lived a very fulfilling life. He got an illness that usually kills most people in an incredibly short time, and then he lived out to a pretty healthy and average lifespan. All while being one of the most famous scientists of all-time, a person that was an inspiration and got so many others interested in science.

I have nothing but respect for him, I don't think history will ever forget this man.
$C: No other scientist is even half as popular as he was. No scientist has reached that level of popularity in pop culture since Carl Sagan and Albert Einstein. However, it is a miracle he was able to live this long with his disease and the fact that he embraced it and found a way to live with it is inspiring. The world is a better place because of him and that can't be said of many people.
$C: Damn. I guess I forgot he was a person who could die. I mean he's been in my life since Dexter's Lab.

It's so weird to thin about how I've never even come close to meeting this man but his life and death still have such an impact on mine.
$C: He died on Pi day. I find this comfortably poetic. 
$C: Smartest man of his time.
$C: [You Want a Physicist to Speak at Your Funeral](https://imgur.com/gallery/cC8sAOw), and I really hope there are a lot at his service/wake/whatever event occurs for him. I don't usually get bent out of shape about "celebrity" passings, but this one... this is a doozy.
$C: Sad news for everyone, not just the science community. He leaves a lasting legacy behind him, both in terms of his scientific contributions but also his perseverance in the face of a debilitating disease. He was truly an inspiration.
$C: This saddens me deeply. You were an inspiration for all, Stephen, and the memory of you will last forever alongside other brilliant minds that have gone before you.

I hope your body and your soul finally get the rest you deserve.
$C: Man, what a sad day for science
$C: Stephen Hawking will be missed. He'll be with us forever through his work and contributions to humanity.
$C: Dust to dust. Ashes to ashes. His contributions will be remembered in the annals of History and the foundations of our Science.

Sic itur ad astra.

$C: In 50 years he'll be seen in a similar way as we see Einstein today. What a legendary figurehead for science.
$C: At least he saw a fair amount of the culmination of his work, he worked on black hole theory for a long time with their existence and properties. Only a few months ago did we receive images for the first time of an event horizon of a black hole. He got to see what he believed in his whole life

Edit: typo haha
$C: RIP. Huge loss. 
$C: He was one of my biggest inspirations as a kid trying to become a physicist coming from a low income area. Starting grad school now. Here is a drink out to you.
$C: Such a sad day to hear news like this. He was such a great inspiration and will be missed deeply. RIP Dr. Hawking. Thank you for all you have done. 
$C: Sad to see him go, but him passing on Pi Day is quite poetic.
$C: I cant remember the last time I was this devastated.
$C: I apologize in advance for the rant.

I work in a field that's very unrelated to Science. All my life, though, I've been coming back to Physics and Math, doing some sporadic reading, wishing I could pursue either field seriously, because it always felt like they were fundamental to everything we see around us, and the universe in general. I never got around to doing anything about it, but this man is one of the big reasons I kept coming back. Just last night, some kind of spark was reignited for some reason, and I went back to a lot of old theory - rifling through my school textbooks, just enjoying the feeling of learning. I stayed up all night going from one resource to another, and the rabbit hole took me to Sabrina Pasterski and then [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09175.pdf) paper. I can't believe that just a few hours after that, the man who wrote it is gone.

I'm not even sure why I'm rambling on. I'm in shock, and I guess I'm trying to say that I promise to never ignore my longing to learn science again. I will pursue it, if nothing else, to honor this great man. He gave his life to it, and gave us so much. With both my spirit and flesh willing, it's a crime to not commit. If you've actually read this far, I apologize for going on and on, but I promise you, whoever you are, that I'm going to try. And I will keep coming back to this post, this thread, and this great, great man's life whenever I wander away from this promise. I hope that one day, I can say with pride that Stephen Hawking inspired my scientific journey.

Rest in peace, sir. We will never let your name or your unmeasurable work and impact be forgotten. 
$C: Damn, this is really depressing. Rest in peace, Stephen. We owe him a lot. 
$C: Holy shit, at a emergency hospital for my cat, browsing waiting to here back from nurse. Jesus I can’t even process this.
$C: Wow. Such as fantastic mind taken from us. I wish his family well.
$C: "Although I cannot move and I have to speak through a computer, in my mind I am free" - Stephen Hawking

Trapped in his own body, his passion for knowledge and science inspired us all. Humanity has lost one of the greatest minds.
$C: Huge loss for humanity, we were lucky to have him as long as we did. I think this means the average IQ of the planet just went down a couple points.
$C: RIP, he lasted so long and made a huge impact.
$C: This hit me hard. As a fellow redditor put it, Professor Hawking wasn’t a person whose death really crossed anyone’s minds despite his condition, therefore it comes as a total shock. 

(Paraphrasing)
$C: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge."
$C: It is hard to understate the tragedy of losing someone of his magnitude. Rest In Peace doctor.
$C: When I was eleven, 1994, a handful of disabled kids were chosen to spend a few hours with him and I was one of those lucky kids.  It was a really interesting and amazing experience.  Not very much science talk, just a successful disabled man sharing his life story with a bunch kids who had very few adults they could really connect with on that level.  He was funny and relatable.  It was definitely one of those moments that shaped my life.  
$C: This is such a sad news for the scientific world. Considering the fact how smart he was, I only hope that the people he was working with were able to grasp as much ideas and knowledge from this genius. 

No matter the condition he was in he was able to have a good life and great people that supported him. Moreover, the respect that he got was earned through hard work and dedication. 

I can add this that he was able to raise awareness  for the disabled people as well. No matter the disability you can achieve great things when your hard work and dedication is set for them. 

RIP Genius. 
$C: He was one of the greatest minds in human history
$C: Noooooo! And on Einsteins birthday too.
$C: Do not be sad he has left this mortal coil.  Be glad he was here and contributed greatly to mankind's knowledge and reaching for the stars.

Rest in Peace, Stephen Hawking, and thank you.
$C: Nah, he finally figured out time travel. We'll see him again tomo.
$C: Rest in peace, Mr Hawking. The world wouldn't have been the same without him.
$C: I let out an audible *noooooo!* when I read the headline. I just assumed he was going to live forever. I know what they mean when they say *the world will be that much worse of a place without him in it.*
$C: [deleted]
$C: The age of 76 is a good age even for somebody who's pretty healthy.  Rest in peace.  
$C: See you among the stars steve.
$C: He has been my hero since I was a teenager. RIP, you amazing human being. You will not be forgotten.
$C: Rest in peace, Mr. Hawking. Without you, I wouldn't have *nearly* the love, or enthusia, towards science as I do. Thank you, not only for inspiring me, but multiple *generations* of people. May you rest in peace among the stars you, and countless others, helped define.
$C: He lost the power of walking

And used a machine for his talking

A brilliant guy

We all sought to buy

His secrets of life. He was Hawking.


$C: A loss for all humanity. He was a brilliant will be remembered forever for his contributions to physics, and for being an inspiration to anyone suffering from physical disability. Rest In Peace.
$C: Kind of weird with it being pi day.
$C: See you, Space Cowboy...
$C: I think my favorite Stephen Hawking story is that a few years ago it was suggested that he update his voice program to something more modern and realistic sounding. Apparently his reply was something along the lines of "Why would I want to change my voice?"

We were lucky to have him.
$C: I know this comment is just going to be buried, but I think it’s of note that Hawking died on Einsteins birthday, who also lived to be 76. Today is also Pi Day. (3.14)
$C: RIP Dr Hawking
$C: His gift to humanity will live on far longer and far reaching than we can conceive. I hope he left his most important thoughts and experiments to his most trusted people.
$C: Another great thinker gone. May he enjoy whatever existence there is after this.
$C: Stardust stuff on its way back to the stars..
$C: WHOA WHOA, WHAT. NO. Dammit, we lost the Einstein of our generation.
$C: OMG, I love his Album, worked with Pink Floyd, his voice was great...

$C: Its devastating news, but maybe one of my atoms will be hanging with one of his atoms in a star one day
$C: Hey thats a heck of a good run, especially with the physical problems he carried for so long.  Did more sitting in a chair than most people do with full mobility.  Hell of a man.  
$C: His name shall be written in the stars: Hawking. His mind was his power, and his power was near boundless.

Sleep tight, Professor. It’s a rest you deserve.
$C: I think we should give him a Valhalla-style funeral fit for a scientist of his stature, by launching him on a rocket into the sun.
$C: Thanks to the NHS for keeping this great mind alive for 56 years after being diagnosed with a deadly disease.
$C: Stephen Hawking was a fucking inspiration. He was a great scientist even if he was a shitty husband. Dude inspired me to study computer science so I owe him for that.
$C: He'll always be an inspiration for scientists both young and old.
$C: A great man. Everyone should read his book A Brief History of Time Changed the way I see the world. I already miss him.
$C: "I’m not afraid of death, but I’m in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first." -- Stephen Hawking
$C: One of the greatest minds to ever roll the Earth. 
$C: For some reason, I never even considered this a possibility. I never thought about the fact that Stephen Hawking would eventually die. Surreal
$C: And now, he belongs to the ages. RIP.
$C: Died in the early hours of pi day.
$C: What an amazing mind we’ve lost today. Extremely sad news. RIP Hawking, may the rest of us continue to follow where you left of.
$C: I met him at a conference and was lucky to be the first of three people to ask him a question. It was a stupid question and it took him two minutes to input a short answer. He inspired so many people. Sad. 
$C: Goodnight, sweet prince. 
$C: He has returned to the cosmos after revealing so much about them.
$C: I'm interested to know more about this Foundation my father has ALS and could definitely use the donations his upkeep is pretty expensive
$C: I will never forget Hawking. Currently studying quantum mechanics in University. This loss is tragic, but I am only now more motivated to complete my studies after hearing this. If I can expand humanities' knowledge even by a fraction of what he did, or at least motivate one person to take the banner after me, then I will know that I did not waste my time here. 

Rest in piece. I will never, EVER forget you. 
$C: He is now parte of the stars he wished to understand! [T]/
$C: Very few of our names will be carried on even 50, 100 years after we pass, but this was one of the legends that will likely never be forgotten for the remainder of human history.

It's a terrible day for rain
$C: He and I had mutual friends, and one of the last things I did before emigrating from the UK in 1998 was to attend a large family celebration at which he was present. The party was held in the garden of a country house, and in no time he was surrounded by a group of young people, and he seemed very happy to slowly answer their questions and discuss matters of universal interest despite the effort and patience required to communicate.

Somewhere I have a photo with him, me, and my two friends taken on that afternoon, and I must dig it out and give it pride of place on the fridge. Not only will he be missed in the world of science but very much at a personal level by his family and friends.
$C: I'm not religious but i like to think he's having a little stroll about heaven right now.
$C: [deleted]
$C: He was told in 1963 that he only had a few years to live, incredible that he made it to 2018 and his legacy will live forever. RIP.
$C: Lift your pie slices in tribute this day.

3.14


$C: Can't believe Einstein's birthday is the same day as Hawking's date of death.
$C: He was actually British. You wouldn't know based on his accent.
$C: If anyone else is wondering how they publish these so fast with historical anecdotes, it’s because they write them ahead of time and have them on deck for when X happens. 
$C: RIP :\( we will remember you fondly
$C: Of all days it was Pi Day he died
$C: A Person who was above society and showed many people the way. 
$C: Well, it’s turtles all the way down from here.
$C: He was inspirational to me. I know that's probably the most cliché thing I could say, but he truly was.
$C: Thank you for everything, Stephen.
$C: How many deaths really shock you?  This one was supposedly many years overdue, yet hit like a brick.
$C: "My expectations were reduced to zero when I was 21. Everything since then has been a bonus."
— Stephen Hawking

And he lives to 76 years old and contributed to us every single day. Rest in peace Stephen hawking.
$C: 3.14 Kinda fitting he died on Pi Day
$C: This man will rest in history among the greatest scientists mankind has ever seen. He'll join the ranks of Einstein, Copernicus, Newton, so many more. Can't wait to hear about my kids learning about Stephen Hawking.
$C: The world has lost one of its finest 
$C: Just when I thought that the world has become a little bit of a better place by the death of that last Nazi today.  
$C: This makes me very sad, he was a big inspiration for me.
$C: Damn. I’m overcome with dread.
$C: Bound by his body but unbound with his mind. 
$C: He is no longer. But will *always* have been an incredible part of this universe, that one could say; through the transient ego that was Stephen Hawking, came one giant leap closer to understanding itself. Such beauty will be truly missed.

R.I.P
$C: Right up there with Einstein, Bohr, Tesla as one of the most brilliant humans to ever live. Learning about Hawking radiation for the first time forever changed how I looked at this thing we call existence. Thanks, Stephen.
$C: This man made black holes suck just a little bit less.
$C: Hopefully wherever he is now he’s not bound to his wheel chair
$C: A man trapped in his own body unable to speak and barely move enlightened the entire world... this should be able to inspire anybody 
$C: You know when someone who is truly respected dies when they are top 7 posts on r/all
$C: The greatest scientist of the modern age has been returned to the Earth from whence he came. You shall be missed, but never forgotten. RIP.
$C: the einstein of our generation
$C: Popping in to pay my respects. What a man. His intelligence has always been awe inspiring. 
$C: The average IQ on this planet just dropped down like 50 points.
$C: I have been holding back for years and I finally decided it’s time to read his books. I’m in the middle of A Brief History Of Time and I receive this news. It’s a sad day 
$C: The world is less intelligent now.
$C: He lived on the very far end of the gauss distribution of intelligent people. One can only imagine and admire his resiliency, to cope with the idiocy of the rest of us. RIP
$C: This will probably get lost in the comments.  But for the longest time I wasn't sure what I wanted to do.  After reading A Brief History of Time in 10th grade, I knew I wanted to be a physicist.  All because of Stephen Hawking.  He was my biggest inspiration and will continue to be as I continue my education and career as a scientist.  Rip Stephen Hawking you will be missed :(
$C: I was at an OU summer school at Durham University in the 90s. We were taking a break outside, drinking tea and discussing electrostatics. Far off, there was a whirring noise that steadily grew louder and everyone stopped when we saw that it was Professor Hawking hurtling down the path in his chair. About 20 feet behind him was his nurse struggling to keep up. 

Silence. We all just stood there in complete shock, surprise and excitement. It was akin to seeing Einstein at a bus stop, or Newton at the supermarket. It turned out that he was there to give a lecture to the university's Mathematical Society. 

Within seconds he had gone and everyone simply started at each other. We had all shared a totally wonderful, totally surreal moment.

Goodnight Professor Hawking. Sleep well.
$C: Whenever the next "golden disc" gets sent into space, something of his needs to be included. 
$C: He's gone now to that great black hole in the sky.
$C: My stomach just dropped and I feel sick. This is the first time in my life when the world doesn't have a "Stephen Hawking, like just before him there was an "Albert Einstein." It feels scary to me, because while he was alive, I knew at least one person who could quantify the universe in its own terms, huge and full of opportunity, and saw our existence as a matter of fact, not a matter of faith. I am weirdly surprised I feel this way. I guess I had more faith in someone like him than I thought. I guess it was important to me that we had a household name super-genius in the public awareness. At least we have Neil, although I think even he would admit he probably isn't on the same intellectual level. But, I'll take him. 
$C: I’m not afraid of death, but I’m in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first.

RIP
$C: RIP this smart dude
$C: So sad. RIP.
$C: We lost a legend tonight...RIP
$C: What an incredible man and what an incredible life. I remember first learning about him watching the Simpsons and I ended up reading up more on him over the years. It's crazy how he was a part of so many lives even if it was in a non scientific manner 
$C: RIP Stephen Hawkins you have opened the eyes of so many individuals with your inspiring words of wisdom. You will be missed dearly.
$C: Wow this caught me by surprise. I almost never watch science-related videos anymore but just last week I watched a few random physics videos that put him back in my mind for a few days. 
$C: This hits hard. Such an inspiration. His brilliant mind and spirit will be missed. 
$C: I was so shocked to read this in the news just minutes ago. What a remarkable man who defied all odds to accomplish so much in his life. 

He will be missed and we may never see another person so great and honestly awe inspiring as him for a long time.
$C: He outlasted his condition for decades and contributed so much in that time:(
$C: I honestly still find it insane he lived this long considering how young he was when he was diagnosed with ALS
$C: What a man, more to celebrate his life than morn his death for a day or two
$C: Rest in peace Dr. Hawking, you will be sorely missed by the scientific community and the world and forever remembered in the minds of your work has and will inspire. 
$C: A truly sad day for all of us, he did so much in his condition that it is almost unimaginable.
$C: RIP to one of the greatest of all time. Not only in trailblazing much of our modern understanding of black holes and radiation but also making it accessible to the layman and being an ambassador to our future in physics. He  will be always be remembered and sorely missed.
$C: This is a real tough one. One of the greatest minds in history. For some reason, I always felt close to him in a way. Never met the guy. Always wanted to though. This hits me almost as hard as Robin Williams. 
$C: Holy crap. That's terrible news, but at least he accomplished a lot during his time. He's an inspiration for everyone, especially those living with disabilities. 
$C: He had so many years of achievement despite the initial diagnosis of ALS saying he was going to die in 2 years. We should be grateful for that. One of the most amazing men in the field of science.
$C: So sad to see him go. What a legend. May he rest in peace.
$C: RIP and thank you for what you’ve done
$C: a sad day for science !!!
$C: Humanity has lost one of its best examples. He was truly an incredible person, and should be an inspiration to us all. I hope we can live up to his example.
$C: I am sad, he inspired so much and so many. 

He will be greatly missed. 

RIP Stephen Hawking. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Thank you for everything, Stephen
$C: Rest In Peace to this great man with a greater mind. He will go down in history among the names of other geniuses like Copernicus, Galileo, Einstein etc.. he'll be missed.
$C: His accomplishments and brilliance are immortalized in every inquisitive mind; a true legend for all humankind.
$C: He was *literally* the Einstein of my time.  
$C: He made me love Science. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who gained from his influence.  Plus his defiance of medical expectations. Fantastic man gone today. Will be missed. 
$C: Rest in peace, you wonderful human being!
$C: I remember when I was 16. Very confused about my place in the world, and fed up with Religious folks telling me they knew it all.

And then I read A Brief History of Time. And my world was changed forever. 

The Engineer inside me was born, and the (pretend) Scientist as well. 

I will miss you Professor Hawking. Wherever you are now, my heart and mind go out to you. I would not be the man I am today had you not entered my life ❤️
$C: Wow...Completely caught me off guard. RIP to one of the greatest scientists of this century. 
$C: Miss you scooting about town, but at least you'll be able to walk now.

Have a stroll, Stephen.
$C: Awww man. I'm not sad per se. Seems like he's lived a full life (understatement). But here I am, still crying. I've idolized this guy my entire life. As someone who has used a wheelchair their entire life, Stephen Hawking was always to me the only public figured available who proved, yeah, brain can triumph. A PhD later, I know I owe this man at least 50% of that confidence.
$C: They say you die two times, the first on the last time your heart beats, the second on the last time someone mentions your name. 

In that sense, I think Hawking will live forever. 

(Though he'd probably educate me on the expected timeframe until the universe will likely no longer be able to sustain that type of complex information.)
$C: I can’t express my sadness. He has been a huge role model my whole life. May he forever rest in all our hearts.
$C: Unfortunate. I get the feeling he didnt much like relgious people such as myself but he still helped progress the knowledge of mankind and for that I'm grateful. 
$C: It's so strange to think we're living in a post-Steven Hawking world now... I hope he rests well.

*"Look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious."*

R.I.P. Stephen Hawking 🌠
$C: A huge loss to mankind. 
$C: He died on Einstein's birthday tragic yet somehow poetic. Reat in peace to truely one of the most brilliant humans to ever live.
$C: Now, there’ll be a Big Bang Theory episode where Sheldon gets the news. 
$C: Even though this wasn't super unexpected, this still sucks. Stephen Hawking was one of the main reasons I love science so much and his work was helped grow my fledgling interest in Astronomy and science in general.

I know he will never read this message, but I want to say thank you Stephen Hawking for everything you have done for science in general and unknowingly done for me. I don't think there will ever be a scientist I respect more than you. We will all miss you and remember you. 

You were the greatest. Rest in Peace.
$C: My heart is broken. Goodbye to the man who gave me my first love of science. 
$C: I think it's not his vast understanding of the universe we should try and keep up with, but his wisdom about life and playing the hand you're dealt that we should learn from. His observations about society are as keen as any 

"We are in danger of destroying ourselves by our greed and stupidity. We cannot remain looking inwards at ourselves on a small and increasingly polluted and overcrowded planet"

They gave him two years after the diagnosis.  

"Perhaps one day I will go into space."
$C: A Brief History of Time changed my life and my perception of existence when I read it at 21.  I didn’t go to college (at that point) and it was books like his that made me feel like there was a world of knowledge accessible to me, even working retail.  Thanks Professor.  You will be missed.  :)
$C: I grew up listening and learning from Mr Stephen... truly sorry to hear of another great mind passing.
$C: It's not often i feel a physical impact at the news of a celebrity death, no matter how much I loved their work. It's even rarer I cry. I felt both just now.

I don't have any poetic words, or beautiful examples for how he impacted me, like I'm sure so many in this this thread do. All I can say is, he's someone I looked up to my whole life, and I will miss him. 
$C: Average IQ of the world goes down.
$C: I wish we could get something from u/poem_for_your_sprog for him.

Nevermind, just saw those!  :')
$C: How come Jay-Z gets stronger headlines than this legend?
$C: I open reddit on my laptop & first thing I see in the day is this ?
$C: Of all the celebrities that we lost last year, of all other unfortunate deaths, even more than MJ passing away, this saddens me the most. I'm just sitting in my car in a moment of silence.


$C: Passed on Pi day. NERD
$C: He died on pie day. How fitting. 3.14. He was the Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University. 
$C: A toast, to a man. A man who bettered humanity.

A man who bettered me, helped me look up to the stars at night and wonder... What adventures await us next.

Cheers, friends. We lost a good guy. But that doesn't mean any one of you is less than profound.
$C: "I have noticed even people who claim everything is predestined, and that we can do nothing to change it, look before they cross the road."
$C: Thank you Mr. Hawking for inspiring so many of us to become science enthusiasts. I may be in fine arts, but you opened my eyes to what lies beyond the heavens. Long before I knew the names of Carl Sagan or Neil Degrasse Tyson. 
$C: I’m drunk 4U. RIP my dood. #stephenhawkings4lyfe
$C: A loss for all humanity. He was a brilliant will be remembered forever for his contributions to physics, and for being an inspiration to anyone suffering from physical disability. Rest In Peace.


$C: No :(... please no. So few little things gave me hope in this world.. damn 
$C: One of the smartest motherfuckers to ever step foot on Earth.
$C: Fuck, this was horrible news to wake up to. Im crying right now. Rest in peace, Stephen Hawking. You did so well in life and I'm so proud of you. You were (and still are, even in death) such an inspiration to us all.
$C: May you keep flying like superman in microgravity! (c)

Or i can quote Rap Battles of Histrory ,though not serious, but true - You were *the Snoop Dogg of Science*, for sure. RIP


$C: I sing the body electric  
I celebrate the me yet to come  
I toast to my own reunion  
When I become one with the sun  
  
And I'll look back on Venus  
I'll look back on Mars  
And I'll burn with the fire  
Of ten million stars  
And in time and in time  
We will all be stars.  

$C: The average IQ of the human race just went down several points. That man was a mountain.
$C: We've lost one of the greats. As someone who's studied physics, this hits close to home. People in this thread are taking about other celebrity scientists like Greene, Tyson, Kaku but I feel the need to point out that those guys while smart, are not even close to being on the same level. Hawking's contributions to science are up there with Feynman and Dirac. I'd even put them near Einstein. 


He discovered and explained a phenomenon that gives us deep insight into the connection between quantum mechanics and general relativity. His work is revolutionary and he developed it around the same time when quantum gravity started to be a serious problem in physics. The only reason he didn't win the Nobel was that Hawking radiation is too weak to detect and therefore unmeasurable. Every theorest though agrees that he is correct and use his ideas without a second thought. He'll go down in history as one of the pioneers of quantum gravity and one of the 'giants' that future scientists will stand on the shoulders of.
$C: Died on Albert Einsteins birthday. RIP
$C: Omg I’m in a class and just saw this. Wow that is depressing. Rest In Peace.
$C: I'm only 19 years old, I didn't grow up with this man, and I didn't follow his life deeply; but I do know enough, and respect him enough, to feel the pain the world is in from this loss. 

 It was strange to me, of course I always thought highly of him, but I didn't follow his work or life all that closely, and yet I cried a little when I saw the headline. 

All I hope is that his legacy continues, and spurs forth renewed interest in the world of science, and reverses the path some countries have taken to discredit basic scientific facts...
$C: It is Albert Einstein's birthday........
$C: Of all the celebrities that we lost last year, of all other unfortunate deaths, even more than MJ passing away, this saddens me the most. I'm just sitting in my car in a moment of silence.

$C: Hawking will be remembered by future historians, I would think, as a mind equal to that of people like Galileo or Einstein or Newton. I feel privileged to have lived during his era.
$C: And just like that our generation's Einstein is dead. The universe is a crazy place.
$C: We are all poorer for his loss, yet richer for having know him.

Rest In Peace. 
$C: Rest in peace hawking! 
$C: Scientists always stand on the shoulders of giants, and Steven Hawking has certainly cast his vast shadow across history.
$C: 
I'm not afraid of death, but I'm in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first.

                                                             ---Stephen Hawking 

Very sad. Let's celebrate his life though, he had a good run for someone in his condition.
$C: Today is the pi day and the birthday of Einstein.
Strange.
$C: Fuck that sucks. RIP mate. You were a legend. 
$C: Wow. Thats hard to take, he's always been a huge figure..
$C: I never would've guessed he'd be that old.  To live that long with that condition and maintain his intellect for so long is a feat that defies all science.
$C: The man who did more than almost anyone else in the history of mankind to show humanity the vastness of space has died. Not only did he die, but he died on a day that represents a number that never ends either, Pi. Even more ironically he died on the same day as Albert Einstein's birthday. This is extremely symbolic to me. He will go down as a modern-day genius and will be talked about for 100's of years to come. The day he died will only add to his mysticism. RIP Mr. Hawking.
$C: :( That's some heartbreaking news to wake up to. Oddly for someone with his condition it'd practically never crossed my mind that he even *could* die - it blows my mind to think that he lived for 60 years after being told he only had 2.

I'm so thankful that he was able to keep pushing forward and continue his work against the odds, and I'm thankful that I got to coexist in the same universe as him.

Thanks for everything, Stephen. RIP.
$C: “I regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail. There is no heaven or afterlife for broken-down computers; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark,” - Stephen Hawking. 

I think this is beautiful and wherever he ends up (if at all) I hope he was happy with his life, he will be so missed. RIP.


$C: "Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of earth,                                                                                                          
And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;                                                                                                
Sunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth..."  John McGee                                                                      
soar, Stephen, soar

$C: I know this won't be seen by many but I have to put this somewhere:

RIP Prof. Hawking, to me and many of my peers you inspired me to get involved in science. After reading A Brief History of Time as an impressionable 14 year old I dreamt of following in your treadmarks. Now, 7 years later I am a Materials Science student at Cambridge although it isn't cosmology I still feel I owe a great deal to you and your books for inspiring me to get into science and without those I may not be where I am today. Every scientific communicator and the majority of scientists around today owe  you a great deal for inspiring us and future generations and getting the public into science. If I can inspire one person to go into science in my future career I'll be proud but you inspired the entire globe. And then you taught me that our heroes are human and real when I saw you, not 10 meters away, in a department store and later at a dinner I was attending. 

There's going to be a weird air in Cambridge today; one of somberness and sadness but mostly one of celebration for the work you did and for the inspiration you planted in every scientist here.
$C: Struggled with many difficulties and lived for self-fulfillment and the advancement of mankind. Master of physics. Rest In Peace Stephen Hawking 🙏🏻
$C: The world's is darker today. Rest in peace doctor.
$C: This is one for the history books. Rip.
$C: He will be missed. I hope future generations will continue to look up to him.
$C: Why have 116.000 people liked his news?

BTW it's Einsten's birthday today.
$C: The world seems a lot more stupider now that he's gone...
$C: He is free from the shackles of his disabled body now, hopefully his energy will wander the stars marveling at the very things he spent his mortal life pondering about. 
$C: News about his death broke my heart. I have so much respect for Hawking. One of the greatest minds of our time. What he did for popularizations of science is amazing. 
$C: "We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special." - Stephen Hawking 
$C: I'm beyond distraught but blessed that we we're graced with his mind for as long as we have been.
$C: I've been trying to type something for 10 minutes, but nothing works. This just sucks.
$C: Hawking checked the date and noticed he was late for Einsteins birthday party.
$C: He died on Pi Day.  Such a Hawking thing to do.
$C: Steven Hawking was a true hero to me. My uncle died of ALS about 8 years ago and lived with it for almost five years.  He was only 48 when he passed. It's a horrible disease and we walk every year in his memory. If anything Hawkings brought a hopeful outlook for others suffering from this horrible disease. In the world of science he made quite an impact as well. Fly high Steven....
$C: It was a miracle he lived as long as he did. I think it’s because he had a rich rewarding life despite his illness. He had a mental life.

When I think of what he went through. Losing control of his muscles bit by bit. Slowly deteriorating. I’d go mad! Yes he was a smart man but he also had an iron will and the fortitude to resist the disease.

Fuck it always hurts to lose people like Hawking and then I lost my grandfather last week too. Death sucks :(
$C: RIP Stephen. It was a privilege sharing this rock for such a brief time. You are an inspiration to me, my daughter, and so many more. I fear for humanity now more than ever. But thanks to you, I will remember, "all we need to do, is make sure, we keep talking."
$C: It's sad to me that A Brief History of Time was listed as the "most popular book no one read"

Let's all celebrate Stephen Hawking's life by reading it together and discussing it here on Reddit!
$C: There is a universe where he is alive and well. You will be missed from this one, deeply.
$C: Legit the only celebrity passing that Ive cared about. Not even a scientist or anything but the dude was objectively incredible.
$C: I hope they make a National Stephen Hawking day
$C: OMG. i am crying like my dog died. RIP, miracle man.
$C: Will Elon send his remains to space?
$C: Born 300 years to the day after Galileo died, and he dies on Pi Day. This man's life was truly about the math of the cosmos.
$C: First time i cried for a celebrity death. 
$C: Don’t say “ it’s sad that he died, earth lost a great mind” say “ he lived a great life, and served us well, Rest In Peace”
$C: The loss the world suffered today is monunental. This guy redefined physics for the common masses. It's not easy being a physicist and a household name. I am gonna miss Stephen Hawking...
$C: I am not prepared for this information.
$C: It was a honour to be alive at the same time that Hawking was. Amazing mind, amazing person. The impact he left will shape the future to come without a doubt. Rest in peace, Stephen Hawking. ❤️
$C: Press F to pay respects
$C: Watching my local news today and they said,  “Stephen Hawking has died, best known for his appearances on the CBS’ Big Bang Theory.”  
$C: It is heartbreaking to hear that the greatest mind on our planet is no longer with us. What are we gonna do without him... 
$C: Hey if you believe in reincarnations...somewhere a genius is born!! 
$C: Thanks for showing hunanity that there are wonders greater than our petty squables, beyond our atmosphere. 

Fly high man. 
$C: Proud to be British right here, because of people like Hawking. 
$C: Good for him, I’d hate to be trapped in that body
$C: One of the most amazing Hawking moments. After having used the same computerised voice for three decades, Hawking went on a quest to search for a fresh sound.  
He held ‘auditions’ for a group of A-list actors, including Liam Neeson, Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson, to seize the “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to be his new voice, in a hilarious clip to raise awareness for Red Nose Day.  
The Hollywood stars all failed, mainly for their lack of scientific knowledge.  
“Stephen, it’s me, surely it has to be me,” Neeson argues in his audition.  
Unimpressed with his line-up, Hawking ultimately sidesteps the auditions and picks one of cinema’s most instantly recognisable voices, **Michael Caine**.  
Enjoy the video [Stephen Hawking's new voice](https://youtu.be/PqXOlfwlVag)
$C: I bet he and Carl Sagan are having some epic chats right now.
$C: I care about Steven Hawking too, but I wanna mark my comment in Reddit history :) all this Karma
$C: No one will read my comment on this thread, but for someone who didn't even know I exist I feel really sad for him passing away. I read a lot of his books, and didn't understand a lot. But he definitely made human kind better. I wish there was more people like him so we can get to a better place faster.
$C: Three months in, this still makes me sad.
$C: RIP. One of the greatest legends of his time, and of mine. 
$C: I wish I could throw a party to celebrate his Ascencion to the universe. 
$C: https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/14/stephen-hawking-professor-dies-aged-76
$C: Godspeed
$C: I literally have Steven on my vision board for inspiration and motivation in the pursuit of knowledge. This is sad day for science. 

RIP Dr. Hawking

[Here's my board.](https://imgur.com/a/NP7ea) It's not much but it helps. 
$C: Great mind who outlived his original diagnosis by about fifty years. I'll miss his great wit. He was terribly funny in interviews.
$C: Sad day.  Sad sad day...
$C: Fuck I’m crying. What an inspiration. 

Thank you for everything Stephen. 
$C: Stephen Hawking was an enormous inspiration to me. I am a disabled man, I now have a masters degree in astrophysics and am waiting to see if I have a PhD place. I’m not sure I’d have come this far if it wasn’t for the example set for us by that cracking chap. 
$C: Sorry to hear this. I have always liked his opinions outside of physics and cosmology. Science, and humanity, has lost a Giant.
$C: My favourite of his was Pet Cemetery. RIP
$C: shine on you crazy diamond
$C: May you rest with the very same cosmic universe you dedicated your entire life to, Mr. Hawking..
$C: Especially here in the US, we desperately need people like him who could explain complex problems to the masses.
  
He will be greatly missed.
$C: [deleted]
$C: At least God ate all his vegetables
$C: RIP Stephen
$C: ☹
$C: :(
$C: Oh no
$C: Rest in peace.
$C: Holy cow. I don’t even have words
$C: Will miss a very brilliant and important man.
$C: Totally didn't expect this :(
$C: We lost easily one of the greatest scientists of our time. However, it should not stop us from progress. We will continue to innovate and push the boundaries on what we know today. Lets make him proud. RPIP Mr. Hawking
$C: Sad to hear of his passing. Despite his disability, Hawking did so much for science and for that I respect him. 
$C: We will always miss you Stephen. I don't know that many minds in the future will be able to hold a candle to yours. Thank you for your incredible contributions to humanity.
$C: Just after I heard of the news, it really saddened me how unfair life can be with illnesses. I can only imagine how much more impact he could have without it...
$C: He gave us a lot, in physics, donations, and understanding of the universe in general, very few humans will achieve his level of contributions to mankind, his work will inspire so many. what a successful life, he now passes the torch of knowledge for the next generations of wanderers.  RIP Genius. Thank you for what you revealed to us all.

$C: Shocked at his passing. Your contributions to science have shaped many lives, Mr. Hawking.
$C: This dude was a hero 4 sure. 
$C: He was 76 and als had made his life hell. Suffocation is a horrible way to go. Hopefully they had good hospice care and snowed him put so he didn't feel it. 

God speed Mr Hawking.
$C: This is one of those moments where someone you never expected to go away, does. 
$C: And now he goes back in to the cosmos that he loved and lived for. 

Give Bowie our regards. 
$C: Bye Dr. Hawking...we'll miss your voice of reason
$C: I think he was just about the best at taking giant concepts and explaining them in ways laymen like me could understand. Even though I don't claim to be an expert, I'd know absolutely *nothing* about theoretical or universal physics if it wasn't for him. R.I.P.
$C: > The universe doesn't allow perfection

RIP - the universe is a little less perfect today
$C: He was one of my inspirations and one of the reasons I took up science in university. Thank you for everything, Mr. Hawking. 
$C: Oh man, this makes me so sad. He was truly an amazing man. RIP dude
$C: He will live on in Simpsons reruns
$C: Today the universe lost a great ally in its quest to understand itself.  
$C: I am about to cry. He was an inspiration for every single person on the planet, and will continue to be. My depression has hit a new low.
$C: He was a huge inspiration to me, especially when I was younger. He, among others, got me interested in science and motivated me to embrace reason. The way he would talk about science, despite using an artificial voice, was so interesting and accessible for an early adolescent like I was.  
  
What a huge loss. But also consider the amazing life he lived...
$C: Thank you for the inspiration Stephen Hawking.
$C: Feels like the end of an era. You will be sorely missed, but your contributions will never be forgotten. RIP.
$C: What a rare and incredible mind he had. To spite a life of ordeal I cannot imagine, he could see through facets of reality that are invisible to the most of us. The weight and grace of his thoughts will echo with humanity forever.
$C: I'm so sad right now. I feel like the brightest light on the planet has gone out. 
$C: I hope we use use his contributions to science for the betterment of our world
$C: He will continue to show the world that nothing can stand in your way if you wish to achieve something.
$C: As an aspiring Physicist -- currently in undergrad -- this is hugely symbolic for me. So many memories of reading and watching Hawking as a kid.
$C: this is a sad loss to the world.
$C: We will miss you forever Stephen Hawking.  The world won’t be the same without you.  😓😭.   Press F to pay respects.
$C: The end of a great era. 
$C: First craig mack now stephen hawking :( RIP

I always admired how hawking never let his illness get in the way of his passion. He did so much for science. 
$C: Thank you Professor Hawkings for all you did. A reminder of the importance of true fact and knowledge in a time where the truth is a struggle. RIP.
$C: Hawking inspired people to be interested in science and to pursue their dreams, but he also inspired people with disabilities that greatness is achieved in many forms and no disability can limit that. He was an incredible scientist and a remarkable man, his impact will be felt for generations.
$C: Know it's early to bring up but, was not expecting this to happen before the slew of others on our deadpool...deeply saddened and heartbroken. Godspeed to any other universes. He will be truly missed.
$C: Truly inspiring man.

May he Rest in Peace
$C: Makes me sad, but good for him to have lived a long life. I wonder if he had any final thoughts to give to the world before he passed. RIP.
$C: Oh wow. Rest in peace you brilliant mind.
$C: Imagine everything he could have achieved, had he not been sick. One of the greatest minds of our era, RIP.
$C: The Universe won't be the same without him.
$C: I've always been a child of science and reason thanks to scientists like Hawking. He will be forever remembered. 
$C: There was just this quality about him that made me think he'd never die. That he outsmarted even death. RIP. 
$C: How sad. Michio Kaku said it better than I could: “Not since Albert Einstein has a scientist so captured the public imagination and endeared himself to tens of millions of people around the world.”

Rest in peace, Dr. Hawking. Thank you for your many contributions to the world's understanding of itself and its place in the universe.
$C: I don’t understand why I’m crying so much. Maybe it’s due to the sheer size of the loss for mankind... what an incredible human being, one who we had the fortune to live amongst for a short while. His contributions will be forever felt, well beyond his own mortal life.
$C: Damn that's sad to hear. He was someone I thought would  be around forever. I never actually pictured him as a mortal man. 
$C: Is it too soon to say SHawking news?
$C: This is a very sad day, I am in disbelief and just staring at the headline :( RIP Professor Hawking, thanks for teaching us so much. We have lost a giant today.
$C: cue windows shutdown sound. 
$C: Who here remembers his Dexters Laboratory appearance?
$C: Now he belongs to the cosmos 
$C: That's really sad, but amazing he had such a long and full life. What a great man
$C: RIP Mr. Hawking, party it up with Sagan on the surface of the stars
$C: He died on Pi day of all days. 

This is just sad... :(
$C: Throughout my life, Stephen Hawking has always been a constant. He was a constant figure of admiration for me. Though I'll probably never grasp all of the work he did in his life, I know that the world of science will be significantly hollower without him.
$C: I hope they have recorded his voice. 
$C: On a day that represents a number that extends infinitely, Stephen Hawking transitions to the infinite...

Fitting. RIP.
$C: He laid pretty big stepping stones for humanity as a whole. A life well lived, despite his condition. 
$C: I feel so blessed that he made it to 76. If you know anything about his medical history you know that he beat all the odds to live such a long, productive life.
$C: The man kept such a positive attitude and a great sense of humor despite his decline in health.

He's an inspiration beyond the contributions he made to the science community (which were revolutionary on their own).

Rest in peace, champ.
$C: So sad to hear of his passing. He helped inspire me to pursue a life of science and looking up to the stars. You had a hell of a run, good sir. Rest in peace
$C: He's sadly dead, but my headcanon is that his chair lives on, having attained sentience of its own, in a fitting precursor to Singularity.
$C: RIP to a truly great human.
$C: This hits me hard. Now I can't dream of meeting him randomly at Cambridge while visiting. 
$C: He shaped how we view the world. Thank you Stephen Hawking on your contributions to mankind. 
$C: I'm just so glad to see so many people feel this loss of such a great man as well. Stephen Hawking will always be my Michael Jordan of Science. 
$C: "It would not be much of a universe if it wasn’t home to the people you love." —Stephen Hawking 

Rest in Peace.
$C: given all his physical struggles, that is a ripe old age. and what an impact he had on the world.  wow.  he will live forever.
$C: His theories fueled my love for space and black holes. He will be truly missed.
$C: Lost but never forgotten.
$C: I was taking a break from doing some photo editing, and this news has completely taken the wind out of my sails.  I feel like a family member has died.

I'm in shock.  

I'm not a scientist, I'm an artist.  But reading "A Brief History of Time" 20 years ago gave me my love for physics, and deepened my love for astronomy.  He fired up my imagination and inspired me.  His very existence showed me that no matter what life throws at you, you give it the finger and keep going.  Prove the experts wrong. 

He was my hero since I was 16.  This one really hurts.

Godspeed, Dr. Hawking.  We're going to miss you down here. <3

(Edit: words)
$C: God damn that sucks so hard. I always really wanted to meet him. An inspiration even without his scientific brilliance. One of the greatest people to have ever lived, I'm happy I got to live while he was alive at least. His legacy will never be forgotten. RIP Stephen Hawking.
$C: Rest In Peace professor Hawking. May your spirit wander throughout the universe and discover all its secrets. 
$C: Sad news... A great scientific and divulger.
$C: While it was unexpectedly expected at some point, I didn't wake up today to find the greatest mind of modern science leaving this plane. I had always half expected him to outlive all of us. R.I.P. Mr. Hawking.
$C: Now others will ride on his shoulders. RiP
$C: He lived more in his lifetime than most of us will. I'm 54 and can only hope to make it to 76. What an inspiration. What a legacy. RIP
$C: Not a name history will soon forget.  It's humbling to think that he battled his affliction with such ferocity -  just so he could have more time to help us learn about ourselves.  Brilliant man.
$C: Stephen Hawking dies on Pi day.. what a coincidence.
$C: I remember him as the first scientist to make astrophysics approachable. I have a copy of 'A Brief History of Time' I've been leafing through since elementary school. He's also the smartest comedian to ever walk(heh) the Earth, in my opinion. He will be sorely missed by all. I'd say rest in peace, but Stephen doesn't seem the type to rest. The small problem of being dead probably won't stop him from unravelling the universe.
$C: One of our brightest lights has gone out, sad day for humankind 
$C: Thank you for inspiring me. Thank you for working through every adversity you faced in life. Thank you for all your contributions to science, mathematics, and humanity. You were a phenomenal individual, and you made one good dent in this world. 
$C: Personally, this man has been my inspiration. I have been trying to get into the field as quickly as possible to meet the great man himself. I’ve tried expediting my schooling process and am currently working on my PhD in theoretical physics. I’m 19 now and was hoping that I would someday get to work with the man himself. Now that I won’t be able to work with him myself, I will have to do my work in his memory. Rest In Peace to this inspiration to thousands of scientists around the world. You will be missed
$C: What a great man and one of the greatest minds, truly a prophet of our time. This is sad news.
$C: This hits close.  What a gift this man was.
$C: Rest in peace, legend hope you become a shooting star of the night. 
$C: Aw man. He was a fantastic source of inspiration for many. He'll be missed.
$C: What an amazing day in human history! What an astronomical day in US History!
$C: A great man and an inspiration to people everywhere. He taught us that despite the odds against us, we can flourish and accomplish so much. His story will never be forgotten. Rest easy sir, it was an honor to live at the same time as you. 
$C: I'm not sad that he died. I'm happy that he lived.

Godspeed Mr. Hawkin, you set the bar really high be it for science or for living after our dreams.

Rip.
$C: I never expected that I would live in a post-Hawking era.
$C: Rest in peace, Dr. Hawking. You were the next one after Einstein. It's a great void you have left for us to fill.
$C: This is extremely saddening news. RIP.
$C: Truly heartbreaking, a real loss to the world. Someone that has inspired so many, changed our views and understanding of the universe, and pushed the boundaries of modern science. All whilst dealing with a disease that was meant to kill him 50 years ago. RIP to a real champ
$C: Wow, I knew this day was coming but it seems unreal.
$C: SH was always a person that you heard about and had a respect for, without even reading anything he had written. 

Its not until you actually delve into his writings that you can understand the contributions he dedicated himself to.
$C: Rest in Peace

And let's be blunt here:

He played a hell of a game with the hand he was dealt. A Game of Life extremely well played.

Let him join the likes of Einstein and Newton and be forever ~~remembered~~ immortalized in our modern culture.

EDIT: Suddenly thought of a better word.
$C: Incredible human being when considering what he overcame in physical limitations to impact the world with one of the most brilliant minds the world has ever seen. Truly remarkable and someone who should be remembered forever.
$C: i am way more upset than i expected to be. i felt like he would live forever having beaten the odds this long. RIP to one of the finest minds to have graced this sorry world
$C: A giant of science and a name forever enshrined in human history. A great loss. A figure's legacy to be preserved for the humans of the future.
$C: Damm, I did not expect this...
$C: "I have noticed even people who claim everything is predestined, and that we can do nothing to change it, look before they cross the road"
$C: In High School, I remember reading about Stephen Hawking, and being introduced to his knowledge and perspective on the universe around us. It really made me absolutely obsessed with science and anything science fiction related. I am grateful for everything that he has done during his magnificent time here on Earth, and may his beautiful soul rest in peace.
$C: I’m glad that I was alive during the time of his brilliance. This is truly a sad day for science. Let’s celebrate his life and the fact that he never let his condition take away from his achievements. What a legend. 
$C: What a thinker, what an inspiration he was to us all, Stephen Hawking shall be sorely missed. Rest in peace.
$C: This is a great loss for humanity. 😣
$C: This must have been what it felt like when Albert Einstein passed

A legend has just died before us. Rest in peace Steven Hawking, your contributions to space and science will be revered for millennia. I hope to live a life a minuscule fraction as fulfilling to the world as yours was.

$C: Truly an incredible man. He inspired many scientists and children throughout his life. Let’s keep his legacy living for generations to come.
$C: I’d like to believe that he was so strong in thought and action that the universe needed him to last as long as he did and discover what he did to add to the human consciousness 
$C: He lived an extraordinarily long time for someone with his condition, he was only given 2 years to live at age 21. We were blessed to get some 53 extra years with him, and also blessed that he had the technology to communicate his thoughts in this day and age.
$C: What a legend, helped humanity on a never ending quest of scientific understanding! Lived way past what anyone thought possible, had a wife and kids , one of the smartest and kindest minds of our time. 

I find it hard to mourn those who had a good life , I could get behind celebrating his awesomeness though :) 
$C: Rest easy Mr. Hawking, heres to the younger generations to fill your shoes. 
$C: On pi day nonetheless. RIP to one of the smartest and most inspirational people I’ll ever see
$C: A sad day for science, and all of humankind. 
$C: Good reason to cry today.
$C: The whole world is going to mourn his loss. He was one of a kind.

It's comforting to know that left little pieces of his brilliance behind; books, lectures, interviews, and random TV appearances don't make up for the fact that such an incredible personal is gone, but at least they're something to hold onto.
$C: His [last](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=qj74uXkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) published work was a children's book that he wrote with his daughter. That's a pretty nice one to end on. 
$C: Incredible human, incredible scientist. RIP
$C: I am so incredibly sad, I don't know why this affects me so much 
$C: Incredibly sad he is gone. That man contributed to science and was an inspiration for thousands of future scientists that will go on to shape the world.
$C: A loss of one of the greatest minds of our time, vastly educating people around the world. You lived a difficult life but u can finally rest easy. The universe will miss you 😢
$C: He died on Pi day. How fitting. RIP
$C: He can finally see what lies beyond the cosmos. Rest in peace 
$C: Is there a Valhalla for scientists? If so, he's got a seat at the head of the table waiting for him. 
$C: An inspiration to so very many. Rest in peace.
$C: I so many words running through my head right now it's hard to know where to begin. I guess I'll just go with this.

Thank you for your lifelong dedication to improving humanities understanding of the universe Mr. Hawking, despite your own struggles. Rest in peace.

$C: He lived a wonderful life. His name will persist as long as we as a species do. I hope they give him the send off he deserves, and I'm now very curious at what his last works are, how far he really pushed.
$C:  incredible man we lost tonight. Im sure his books and his story inspired many to discover more about our universe.
$C: A very sad day for mankind. One of the most brilliant minds on this earth is now gone. Rest in peace.
$C: I hope he goes to whereever he needs to tend to.

RIP Mr.Hawking
$C: Just horrible news. I wasn't alive to see Einstein revolutionize physics but I was alive to see Stephen Hawking do it while battling something that should have killed him a long time ago. A real warrior, and inspiration. We shall never see his like again. Rip.
$C: A sad day for humanity. A true inspiration to the world and Is contribution to science Is incredible. Rest in peace Mr. Hawking.
$C: "Look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist." 

A truly fascinating human being that will be missed. Rest In Peace.
$C: his time on this earth well spent

his legacy lives on
$C: RIP, Now he can join the stars!! 🌌🚀
$C: Sweet dreams spaceman
$C: Oh my god. This man was such an inspiration to people everywhere interested in science. I'm just glad he beat his initial prognosis and was able to share his gifts with the world. I hope it wasn't a painful death.
$C: He was supposed to live to 23.  He made it to 76.  An amazing man who will be missed
$C: Was he working on anything? Or was he too ill?
$C: If it were possible, the stars would shine a little dimmer tonight. 
$C: You know you're gonna outlive some of your heroes but it's still just as devastating when it happens again. Rip
$C: A great man, who showed that even in a wheelchair he could even change both our understanding of the universe AND pop culture. A hero to both scientists and the the disabled. No matter how much you judged the book’s cover, the pages themselves were miraculous.
May he Rest In Peace.
Thanks, Stephen.
$C: Loved reading his books - he was really well versed in breaking down tricky topics.
$C: This is truly a sad day, but one we should have all expected to happen. He lived for far longer then anyone thought and done more then anyone could have believed. It is a shame we lost such an intelligent person, but he has left behind a lot for future generations...you know as long as we don't go kill outsells off in some stupid way.
$C: My sister called me at Midnight to tell me the news. Stephen was my hero and someone I looked up to. The world is a bleaker place without him.
$C: "I’m not afraid of death, but I’m in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first." - Stephen Hawking

$C: See you, space cowboy. 
$C: Seeing this hit me a lot harder than I would have ever thought it would.
$C: He was a gangster,
 
always in our hearts, 

talking about space and shit.
$C: I didn't know Hawking even had the ability to die.

Nah, he ain't dead, he'll come back in the reboot but with a bigger wheelchair and half his face melted off, or as a wise ghost that'll tell you something cryptic and nonsensical but will make sense in a time of need.
$C: RIP Professor Hawking. You will be forever missed!
$C: In all honesty while his science was great he truly inadvertently became a great advocate for disabilities, RIP
$C: Damn, the universe just got a little bit darker
$C: Rest In Peace Mr. Stephen Hawking
$C: Now he knows the answer to the biggest question in the universe.
$C: Rest in peace, Stephen. So sad to hear.
$C: The craziest part is that for him it was already the 14th which is Pi day 
$C: Eyes forward, capsuleer, the cyno is not yet lit.

Consider your modules, your rigs and ammo before you undock. For the cyno is not yet lit.

Break free of the station and witness the universe before you. For the cyno is not yet lit.

Set your ship to fly through the vastness while you wait. For the cyno is not yet lit.

Pay attention, capsuleer, for those who have gone before you call for you to join them.

The cyno is now lit.

o7 
$C: I always had great respect for him. And strangely enough, his voice, even though a machine, is iconic and evokes deep thought. I will always miss his voice.
$C: "It would not be much of a universe if it wasn’t home to the people you love."
$C: Damn, well his memory will live on forever in science.  
$C: I know the guy was an atheist, but I hope whatever afterlife awaits him is a good one. 
$C: There’s a black hole in our hearts today. 
$C: My entire reason for going into the sciences and my continued love for it currently in college. Thank you for everything and for the inspiration, rip sir. 
$C: he is one of my admired scientist, i wouldn't know much about blackholes if i didn't read some of his wiriting
$C: I just think it's stunning he managed to live for this long. We ought to celebrate that. 
$C: I am truly grateful for the person that he was. His story is absolutely remarkable and inspiring for many especially ones with disabilities. Thank you for living your life the way you did. It was great to see how much you were adored.
$C: 2018 just keeps getting worse 
$C: I'm actully getting a bit choked up reading this. What a huge loss for this world.
$C: As a scientist with a (very slight) disability, he certainly inspired me as a kid, and before I became a cell biologist, I very much wanted to be a Physicist like Dr. Hawking. 
$C: Damn. This caught me off guard. An incredible man, who I have never met but would have been an honour in which to speak with him. RIP.
$C: I didn't believe it for a few minutes hard to believe he's dead.
$C: He made me want to read and learn more, and decide to buy my first telescope. Thanks Stephen. 
$C: Sad that the world loses a brilliant and inspirational mind and person today, but he lived an extremly fulfilling life much longer than anyone said he would. Sad hes gone but his life had a huge impact in so mant ways despite everything that faced him and should be celebrated and remembered by those he inspired and the fields he changed. Rip :(
$C: At the very least his passing on Pi Day is an absolutely perfect match for that man.
$C: That's no good :( Still, he beat the odds with his illness for so many years, and accomplished so much! He'll be remembered for all the advancements he's made for a very, very long time.
$C: I usually well up when I learn of the passing of a great man...tonight I will cry myself to sleep. Rest In Peace Mr. Hawking.
$C: An aspiring computer engineer and a lover of the stem field here to pay his respects. Rest well Dr. Hawking and thank you for all you have done for humanity.
$C: My heart just broke a little.
I’m not in the science field professionally but I always looked up to him and the teachings he brought to all of us about the universe we live in.
Damn..
$C: Cant they just turn him off and back on again?
$C: Thank you, Stephen Hawking for your countless contributions to the field of physics. You are a major reason for the incredible advancement of science in recent years. You will be remembered as one of the greatest scientist in history. Rest In Peace. 
$C: May he shine eternal among the stars that he cause many to look up to.
$C: The world of knowledge he provided will be expanded upon for years to come. He'll go down with greats of scientific history.
$C: A true superstar of science in every way. Hopefully he and others like him have and continue to inspire people to become familiar with the names of those literally changing our understanding of the world as we know it.
$C: I've noticed that everyone, including me, seemed to just deem him as immortal. It would have always been a shock, I think, and oddly saddening he wasn't immortal.

But living 53 years longer than what everyone thought you'd survive while making that big a contribution to science, I don't know, it feels immortal enough to me.
$C: ‪Stephen Hawking died on Einstein’s birthday - Pi day. What a remarkable coincidence. ‬

‪You were one of many reasons I’ve been interested in the sciences for nearly all of my life. Thank you for that.‬

‪RIP Professor Hawking.‬
$C: Selling new wheel chair, comes with voice box and it is motorised. 
$C: An inspiration of strength, knowledge, and fortitude. He was a world treasure. 
$C: Rest in peace.
He was brilliant and we won't forget him.
$C: I think it's kind of poetic that it's Pi Day today, a day where the world pays more attention than usual to mathematics and science. And just as there was a great scientist who came into this world on Pi Day, so too was there a great scientist who left it on Pi Day. 

To the man who inspired so many minds to rethink their understanding of the Universe: You will be sorely missed. Rest In Peace. 
$C: My 9th grade math teacher gave me a copy of A Brief History of Time. I probably read it six times through my high school years. I believe it caused me to be a more mindful person about science and a more critical thinker in general.

Here's to the great black hole. Farewell, Dr. Hawking.
$C: I was confused why people were talking about him all of a sudden, and now I'm just devastated.
$C: I remember seeing a picture of Stephen Hawking in 3rd grade for the first time (circa 1995). The caption beside his photo told that he was one of the smartest people alive, and that was when I learned not to judge a book by its cover. RIP
$C: Well we lost a smart one.  Not the best of personable people, but someone that could truly think outside the box with actual reason .
$C: Damn.  For those that haven't read it yet, check out his book "A brief history of time."  It's surprisingly easy to digest and a great read.
$C: I vaguely remember him saying that he wanted to go to the center of the Galaxy. I hope they put him in a rocket and shoot him to the black hole. 
$C: I was just listening to a Simpsons history audiobook this morning that mentioned the time they had him on the show. They said he had a great sense of humor. He told this story to the Simpsons staff.  “One of the things he likes to do is tell his driver to slow down. So one of his kids reprogrammed his chair so when he try to do that it said ‘Go you bastard go!’”
$C: Honestly surprised he lived this long
$C: I checked Reddit after surfing through Wikipedia on binge-reading articles, and surprised that Stephen Hawking has died. A sad day for us. 
$C: What!?  
Noooooo..... 😭  
*I'll never get to meet him now*
$C: A brilliant and unique mind, but what I found even more remarkable and memorable about Stephen Hawking was his perseverance. He did not let his diagnosis of ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) define him -- he let his amazing scientific work and theories do that, and never stopped working to try to explain our universe.

As someone whose grandfather passed away from the same disease, ALS hits close to home and I found Mr. Hawking's willingness to keep pushing on despite the circumstances truly inspiring. 

The Guardian and BBC do not call ALS by name in their articles, but I just want everyone to know what a strong warrior anyone with ALS is, was or will be,  and what an imprisoning ordeal it is. 

RIP Stephen.
$C: Wow, that’s a big loss to humanity 
$C: A loss of a great mind. 
$C: The world has lost such a precious scientist and person :( He was one of the most inspiriational people living on Earth ever
$C: I'm am not sad. I am going to his time travel party!!
$C: How much for his chair?
$C: I don't think I would have been where I am today without the work Hawking has done. Watching his documentaries and reading his books made me fall in love with astronomy and our beautiful universe.

Without him, I don't know if I would have pursued a career in science today. Hawking inspired me to always look at the grand picture and to keep asking questions.

Despite the sad news we bare today, let us remember the man for his accomplishments. Let us not forget the battle he faced for 55 years every single day. Let us be inspired by his work and his legacy.

His body may now be gone, but his mind, is finally free. Rest in peace Dr. Hawking's
$C: Managed to pass away 3.14 pi day. Rip Stephen hawking. 
$C: I recently finished Hawking's *Brief History of Time*. A lot of it went over my head, but even in the denser chapters he had such an accessible understanding of deep concepts to amateurs. 

The world lost a great mind.
$C: We were lucky to have him as long as we did.
$C: hopefully when we die we can explore the universe with our souls because I'm sure he would be having a blast right now.
$C: Intel just lost their best sponsor!
$C: Legit crying right now
$C: This is the first one that’s actually hit me hard. God damn Stephen Hawking one of the smartest people to ever live. He felt immortal almost. I never expected this day to come. 
$C: A true pioneer and an inspiration. Today is a sad day, but let us remember his achievements and the amazing work he has done. Thank you Mr.Hawking for all you have done for the world of science and inspiring others to take control of their destiny's despite life's struggles.
$C: A surprise to be sure, but an unwelcome one
$C: ‘It would not be much of a universe if it wasn’t home to the people you love.’ - Rip Stephen Hawking 
$C: omg. so sad he was a great man rip.
$C: Damn. He beat incredible odds with his diagnosis and contributed greatly to science. The world will miss him.
$C: His body may be gone but his soul is eternal. He will forever live on as one of the great minds. A terribly sad day for scientists everywhere :/
$C: He was a personal hero of mine since childhood. When I was in third grade, I picked up a copy of A Brief History of Time. It inspired me and changed my life. My undergraduate education is in physics, and I still hope to one day go back and become a theoretical physicist if I can. RIP to a great man.
$C: His Ph.D. thesis is available online if anyone is interested. Thank you for your contributions. 
$C: Craig Mack
Stephen Hawking
Artie Lange
$C: Rest in piece dude. You've inspired many generations of kids to love science. 
$C: He was a huge inspiration all my live.. he will be greatly missed.
$C: "Not only does God play dice but sometimes he throws them where they can not be seen." 

And without you sir, they'll be even harder to find. Rest in peace Dr. Hawking
$C: Rest In Peace, Mr. Hawking, you will be sorely missed, sorely missed indeed.
$C: I'm honestly amazed he lived this long.
$C: I read A Brief History Of Time when I was 6. I loved it, and rereading later I understood a surprising amount of the contents. 

I wanted to be an astrophysicist until I got to uni and discovered my mathematical ability was more suited to being a writer. 

This one is going to hurt. RIP Professor Hawking. You were my inspiration. 
$C: Ugh! I know I had 2 decades to prepare for this dreaded day... But that still wasn’t enough to stop that gut punch. RIP, Professor Hawking.
$C: This is a terrible loss. But none lost for science. Let's look forward to greater accomplishments! 
$C: Because of where I live, it reads like he died in the future, on pi day. So that’s like... a really Stephen Hawking way to die. 
$C: He always inspired me as a little kid and he never stopped being a hero of mine. RIP
$C: Stephen Hawking passed away the day before Pi Day when we contemplate the unceasing & circular. Let us carry on the cycle by standing on the shoulder of this giant to dream & explore further than ever before. The end of one life, one journey, is not the end of our story.
$C: Maybe time travelers will come back to this day at some point.
$C: I’m so hurt. It had been my dream to meet him since I was six years old. He made me realize my dream of wanting to become an astrophysicist. I wasn’t really religious, but I would pray for him to stay alive so I could one day see him. I guess that won’t happen now. I’ll miss you, Stephen. Terribly. 
$C: Rest in Peace to an incredible man. 

> Look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious.
$C: I don't know what to say besides shit. The world has lost a great man and we're worse off with him gone.
$C: The first book of popular sciencie I read was "The Universe in a Nutshell", when I was about 17 years old.

Such an amazing mind, an amazing writer, an amazing scientist, an amazing person.
$C: I will miss him, undoubtedly. He has remained an inspiration to me to continue fighting even when life gets hard, when things seem impossible and entirely out of your control. He was a strong man.
I had always wanted to meet him, and now I know I cannot. It really motivates me to go out there and meet my role models and inspirations before it is too late. Even at death, he continues to influence me.
We will not forget him.
$C: I'm not usually upset when we lose celebrities and famous folk, but this hit me hard. The odds he beat living with ALS for how long he did is astounding. What an amazing man, I think I'm going to watch The Theory of Everything tonight. I like that film.

What a bloody inspiration.
$C: It’s been an honor to live in the shadow of such a giant. What an amazing man.
$C: You have inspired so many of us with your brilliance, friend. Thank you for helping these apes get a little closer to the stars.
$C: May you walk free amongst the stars now Mr Hawking.
$C: The average IQ of the world just dropped.
$C: died on Einstein's birthday

what a coincidence
$C: RIP.  So sad.  Beautiful mind.
$C: Sad to see such a contributor to the modern world of science pass away. Its strange, he lived roughly 50 years past what he was expected too, but im sure the world would have benefited from yet another 50.
$C: Waiting on that Big Bang Theory episode tribute.
$C: Respect, hopefully people will try to live like Mr. Hawking did, with dignity and grace. 

Thank you Mr Hawking, for inspiring generations of scientists and people suffering from disabilities. 
$C: Wow. I am deeply saddened by this as an enthusiast of space and an engineer. He truly was an inspirational and amazing person. Though he may not believe, I pray that he rests in peace.
$C: "I believe alien life is quite common in the universe, although intelligent life is less so. Some say it has yet to appear on planet Earth." 

RIP Hawkings. Intelligence on Earth has gone down with your loss.
$C: VERY BUMMED. As a young teen, not yet even understanding what he wrote about, the fact that he became one of the world's greatest minds is what drove me toward a love of science. 
$C: As someone who deals with memorabilia, my work gets so busy after someone of note dies. Now countless people are going to want something from him it’s almost sickening. I’ve come to realize that people usually tend to not care about “celebrities” until they’re dead. I will post a picture of every item I get from this man in my job. And I don’t doubt that I’ll get at least 3 items by Friday. 
$C: Was he seriously sick (aside from his condition) and dying, or was this sudden?  I hadn't heard anything about him until this news.
$C: 01001100011010010110011001100101001000000111011101101111011101010110110001100100001000000110001001100101001000000111010001110010011000010110011101101001011000110010000001101001011001100010000001101001011101000010000001110111011001010111001001100101011011100010011000100011001100000011001100111001001110110111010000100000011001100111010101101110011011100111100100101110

$C: Rest in Peace to one of the greatest minds of our times. Hope to achieve a tiny fraction of what he has.
$C: Science as a whole just took a huge loss. He was the Steve Erwin of his field. I'm at a loss. He was such a strong man - so influential and important with his condition. 
$C: Stephen Hawking once conducted a simple experiment to determine if time travel was possible. What he did was he threw a party and invited the whole entire world to come at a specific time and date, however he did not send out the invitations until after the party l, asking for time travelers. As we expected no one showed up (poor Stephen) however this method blew my mind as a child and taught me that there is an infinite amount of ways to gather knowledge and you don't need to know everything to know something.

A man who was constrained to a chair for a majority of his life was able to travel outside the box most of us can never escape. Although Stephen Hawking is no longer with us he will forever be an inspiration to science just as Einstein and many others
$C: My heart is so so so sad by his passing but I’m sure he is resting peacefully wherever his soul rests.
$C: Will be greatly missed not by people but by humanity. ie everyone. Few will have a greater impact than this genius who for me was most incredible for his ability to overcome his own personal issues and still achieve so much more than i could in 100 lifetimes.
$C: The world has lost a great mind today.
$C: One of the best of us. I feel more exposed to the vast emptiness all around us now. 
$C: We will be able to retrieve his information someday.
$C: Some of my favorite quotes from this wonderful man:

"It would not be much of a universe if it wasn't home to the people you love."

"Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change."

"Life would be tragic if it weren't funny."

“However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at.” 

"My expectations were reduced to zero when I was 21. Everything since then has been a bonus."

-- Stephen Hawking
$C: A man becomes a legend..
$C: Wow, it’s hard to explain how saddening this is. Hawking truly was one of the brightest minds ever, and I’m very fortunate to have been alive while he was. Considering that most of what he accomplished in his life was after his diagnosis is really incredible and motivational. I study a completely different field of science, but Stephen Hawking will forever be an inspiration for me while pursuing scientific knowledge or just life in general. However, as sad as this is, I think it’s going to be beautiful to celebrate his tremendous life in the following days. RIP 
$C: Incredible how long he lived. He’ll be missed and surely never forgotten. 
$C: The hottest thing on wheels
$C: He lived with his physical condition for so long that he seemed immortal, so this feels like a shock.
$C: God damnit. NO NO NO NO NO NO.
$C: This is buried but I just have to type it out. Honestly, this one is a bit of a gut punch. This man was an example to lots of people. No evil in him. No ulterior motive. Just a man who cared about humanity and the future. Rest in peace. Thank you for all you did.
$C: He's answered more of my questions about the universe than God.
$C: The best-known theoretical physicist of his time, We're surely going to miss him
$C: Good night, sweet prince.
$C: This legitimately hurts on the same level it did when I heard that Robin Williams had died.
$C: Hawking passed away on 3/14, Pi Day. Which is Einstein's birthday. Both Hawking and Einstein lived to be 76.

What a beautiful world we live in.
$C: "Do so much while you are alive, that, after you die, people should put you in their hearts"
A legend remains forever in our hearts. May his soul RIP.
$C: He died on pi day of all days.
$C: Serious question, how did he manage to survive that long? 
$C: Is there any way I can send my condolences to his family? They've lost someone far more important to them than the world's greatest mind.
$C: I will always be thankful to this man whom I've never met whose discourse expanded my mind to the wonders of existence.
$C: What terrible news to start the day... rip Stephen. 
$C: Damn that hit like a  ton of bricks.  
$C: He was born on Galileo's death anniversary and died on Einstein's birth anniv.
$C: RIP Steven Hawking! I’m in complete shock. I just finished reading A Briefer History Of Time; It was such an amazing book. Your work on Black Holes has been extremely inspirational, and one of the many reasons I am pursuing degrees in Physics and Applied Mathematics. Your contributions to the field will be held with high regard, and you will be talked about in the vain of Einstein, Newtown, Galileo, and many others. 
$C: Great man. Simply a great man. And thus you ascend unto the stars.
$C: What s would be a good first book or paper of his for someone with barely any knowledge of his field. I'd love to honor him by reading his work. 
$C: As a kid, my dad had A Brief History of Time on tape. It was even narrated by Hawking himself (which I’ve never been able to track down since). I remember thinking his voice was cool and my dad explaining to me why he spoke through a computer program. It was so impressive to 8 or 9 year old me that he was so smart even though he really had no control over his body. That book on tape really catapulted my interest in the universe, which shaped my entire worldview in a lot of ways. So I owe him so much for that.
$C: I just found out about Stephen Hawking dying tomorrow. I think he would be happy that happened.
$C: A once-in-a-generation mind. Wrong occasionally but with the breadth of intellect to open new doors. We have lost a great.

What blows me away is that he persevered in explaining this stuff even though the writing process was so hard. It's like Beethoven's 9th being written, as it was, by a nearly deaf man. A level of effort that showed someone passionate about his work and not willing to give up. 

Rest easy brave scientist. We will remember and expand on and test your thoughts. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to do so.
$C: “The reason we say humans have free will is because we can't predict what they will do.”❤️R I P brilliant, brilliant man..❤️
$C: One of those deaths you're never, ever prepared for. 
$C: Rest in peace, professor Hawking. His passing seems far too soon, and surreal. I was hoping the first post on this was a troll, then I saw this one.
$C: Truly a legend, myself and many many others look up to him.
Rest in peace Dr. Hawking, you will never be forgotten.
$C: "Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking" Going to watch it this weekend.
$C: Heads up, God! There's a quiz tomorrow in Cosmology.
$C: Great guy . Was ahead of his time and provoked theories that the 21st century (us millennials) can understand quantum theory and black holes 
$C: He died in the pi day... What a loss. RIP Professor.
$C: The charity link for the hawking project looks fake. Home page shows a gator hosting internal error. There is no info about the charity available.
$C: Actually he was the person because of whom i fell in love with physics.
$C: He died at age 76, the same age as einstein, on einsteins birthday (and pi day). RIP
$C: He was a truly revolutionary man. Rest in power, Mr. Hawking. 
$C: Well at least he knows there is a heaven and hell now 
$C: Wow. It's hard to believe he's gone. He was so inspiring as a person... despite all his problrms, he managed to live a life not even the average healthy person could dream of. I was imptessed he lived for so long, managed to continue as s prominent scientist, and even manage to overcome the innability to talk eith his diseases. Such a terrible thing to happen really. 

I still can't fathom this news...
$C: RIP mr hawking. You are what inspired me to appreciate science. You’ll go down in history as one of the greats alongside Feynman, Einstein, and Newton
$C: Wow. What a great human being. He overcame many obstacles to live to an old age and make an impact that will long outlast him. May he rest in peace.
$C: One helluva fighter. We can do nothing but celebrate his life and his achievements.
$C: RIP one of the most legendary men of science ever. 
$C: What does this mean for physics?

What did Hawking contribute?
$C: Gone but not forgotten.

Seriously, I take solace in the fact that we as a human collective will not forget the man who taught us so much while physically capable of so little.

If a heaven does exist, Dr. Hawking, you’re there walking around right now.
$C: My favorite bit of information regarding Stephen Hawking...

$C: Who do we pick to inherit his spirit and pass the mantle onwards to?
$C: rest in peace, among the stars.
$C: It's astonishing that he survived for so long with his illness! RIP
$C: I hope he just rests in peace, and that his work will be able to keep inspiring people over generations.

$C: The world lost a brilliant mind today. 
$C: Rest in Peace #StephenHawkings.
$C: RIP Stephen , as a religious person myself , it is disgusting to see some people making fun of his death , just because he had difference believes .  I guess this is something that will never change in some humans , they can’t face you when you are alive but will wait for your death to take the opportunity. 
$C: I hope that the world recognizes the importance of science, Rest in peace.
$C: A loss for the human collective. I appreciate your time on Earth and what you did for multiple domains of knowledge. And now I’m at a loss for words :’(
$C: Rest In Peace. The universe will honor you indefinitely 
$C: I cried when my grandfather passed away a couple of years back and I shed a tear tonight at the passing of Dr. Hawking. In the darkest periods of my life, I turned to astrophysics to find meaning in life and Dr. Hawking was my guide with his books and essays. For someone with a debilitating condition, he's an inspiration on the power of the mind and the will to beat the challenges life throws at you.

RIP Dr. Hawking. Go well.
$C: This is so bizarre, I literally just got done watching the Star Talk where they interviewed him, and check Reddit before I went to bed to see this.  
$C: Stephen Hawking. Dead on 3/14?
$C: My heart sinks.  My heart sinks low.
$C: On Pi Day, too. How irrational.
$C: Heartbreaking. But let's celebrate his legacy rather than morn his loss
$C: His biggest accomplishment in my opinion was showing just how powerful the human mind really is
$C: Rest in peace sweet prince..
$C: One of the greatest of all time. 
$C: What a shoking day. May he rest in peace. Very sad day for science and humanity
$C: This was one of those of I felt would be alive forever. It's weird knowing he isn't going to be around anymore. 
$C: I had the honor of working his last birthday celebration.  
https://imgur.com/vvIABVV
He was feeling well enough that following this keynote, he attended 3 days of black hole lectures as an audience member.  Here's a shot from the robo camera's:
https://imgur.com/vvIABVV
Dude was awesome.  Glad I got to wish him happy birthday.
$C: I posted this to face and Twitter, but I feel the need to post it here too: 

Shit. An idol for handicapped people the world over, Stephen Hawking taught me that I could still be successful in spite of my disability. As long as I had my mind, the rest was irrelevant. Rest in peace sir. I hope to be half of the model you are someday.
$C: We didn't deserve him. Let's try to earn the love he gave us. 
$C: As a true scientist, he left this world on 3.14. Godspeed sir...
$C: I always dreaded when this day would come. He was my favorite living physicist and was one of the scientists who helped me realize my love for space and everything about it. An absolute inspiration. We were so lucky to have him and it’s so sad this small chapter on earth is now ending. Thank you, Stephen, for all of your work you put into helping us build a better relationship with the universe. Now going to have a couple shots out of my astronaut animal themed shot glasses and then go stargaze in your honor. 
$C: I don't even have words to express how I feel but I feel like I need to comment to be a part of potential history. This is absolutely nuts and definitely the last thing I saw coming. Thank you for you contributions, Mr. Hawking, and may you rest peacefully.
$C: I was just thinking about him for the pass 2 weeks.
$C: Saddening to hear of his passing

RIP great man. The world is poorer with your loss. 
$C: He defied the odds and never let his disease run his life. He was and always will be an inspiration to me and a boon to humanity.
$C: Hawking knows he’s hallucinated his entire reality; he’s had loads of practice escaping his body and living in his mind. So I’m sure his death wasn’t as frightening for him as many of us imagine our ego-trembling deaths might inevitably be.
$C: He was one of my biggest inspirations to pursue engineering, leading to now successful career. I am thankful for all he has given us. May he Rest In Peace.  
$C: May he Rest in Space he loved to reside. 
$C: Even though it doesn't really compares...

As someone who suffered from a "light" case of Guillain-Barré, i was able to deeply relate to 
Mr. Hawking, and even though i was just some random teenager with a cheap telescope who sucked at math, he became the biggest source of inspiration and willpower in my life.

Even at the hospital and during physical rehabilitation i read every single work he ever published, i watched the movie and couldn't withstand the tears. 

In the end, even when he was a Mathematical Genius we both understood the feeling of your body slowly betraying you, your dreams being carried away from your life as every day pass and not even a name can be given to your disease. The consideration that you will be forever limited in everything that you will ever do. Watching those who surround you, desperately trying to help you, falling into desperation.

But even then, we both faced the adversity with a positive reaction and we both went on with our lives. 

I can't even imagine the amount of people who right now might be in the same situation, those who suffered from the same or similar diseases who also took this wonderful man as a source of inspiration and maybe those who will be right now suffering from a hopeless future, getting to know that there was this one man, who even with such a mortal and debilitating disease, was able to pass on to history as one of humanity's greatest minds. 

Not only will i deeply miss you Professor, so will the rest of the world and the future generations of this race.


$C: Well... Today's gonna be a sad day.. 
Rest in peace, my only and best idol in the whole universe. 
$C: He does not believe in an afterlife, so therefore all I can say is that his belief in nothingness would be much easier than the suffering he had to endure in this world.
$C: Thank you for everything.  I don't cry often, especially for celebrities, but this was so much more. Such a loss can only be quantified as  heartbreak.
$C: For pi day too.... Damn.
$C: [removed]
$C: I hope humanity can live up to the potential you hoped it was capable of...not the fate it deserves.

$C: Well this is horrible. Damn this really makes me sad.
$C: God speed.  Please dont forget us and make sure to send us a signal when you know how to find us.
$C: Few men could find in the recesses of their souls the passion, spirit, and curiosity he carried in his life. He found locomotion in physics even as he lacked it in limb. He discovered radiance in all-consuming darkness and in his relentless pursuit of the mysteries in that darkness he enlightened us to the nature of that locomotion. I would ask he be left to rest in peace but what peace can a soul of such relentless determination to solve life's mysteries find? His spirit and passion shall instead live on to inspire and cultivate a generation of scientists and knowledge seekers. His memory shall continue to unearth the mysteries of the universe long after he himself has confined himself to antiquity. His was the temperament of a scientist. He lived as one and he died as one. Now that his reservoir of courage has faded we must continue that scientific tradition of experimentation, contemplation, and revelation in his memory and name. It was his passion to pursue knowledge. Let us carry on that passion. Let us carry on the name Stephen Hawking with the same nurture of knowledge he championed, long after he has been silenced by the Earth.
$C: It's a sad day and a great loss for the science community.
$C: I looked up to him. To me he was this era's Einstein. 

Rest in peace Mr. Hawking.
$C: He just had to pass on Pi day.
$C: I now imagine him flying through the cosmos using his chair as a faster than light rocket ship.

He's also going to get a new voice, but prefer to imitate the one he had on earth. 
$C: I do feel like losing someone with that level of influence will echo through our subconcious very powerfully. If there is anything after death Im sure hawkings will receive the best, and even then mabye he will choose to come back and do it all over again
$C: At least now he has the answer to the biggest question of all, what's next? 
$C: People do not die until their name is last uttered, for that he will never die. Thank you Stephan for your contributions. RIP.
$C: The world has lost one of its greatest minds today. You beat the odds of your prognosis. I hope you are at peace Mr Hawking and that your family is also.  Rest easy Sir.
$C: The world as a whole has lost a lot of instrumental people in the last several years. This one hurts. Personally and collectively. What a great mind. 
$C: Wow RIP Hawking. Truly one of the greatest scientists pushing the envelope of his fields
$C: Takes a while to digest the news. He battled ALS for so long against the odds, but the world needed him for longer. A true luminary, wish he is still alive in a parallel universe, and his multiverse theory comes out to be true.
$C: He's provided us with so many insights into the universe. It seems fitting that now he truly is a part of it. Have fun out there Stephen.
$C: Rest in peace, you will be missed!
$C: Man... I probably have the emotional repertoire of a rock but this really got to me. This man was a huge inspiration to so many people not only in the field of science but to society as a whole. Such an inspirational figure that even with his terrible fortune was able to make something truly extraordinary out of the time we are given here on this planet. You will be missed Mr. Hawking. Thank you so much for having graced us with your humor, your inspiration, and your knowledge. R.I.P.
$C: I'm so happy that he was given so much time, when he was one of the people that truly needed it, and gave us all so much.
$C: Thank you for all your contributions to science.
You are amazing.
Rest in peace

$C: He will be missed. Such an inspiring individual to a lot of people. Literally watched the theory of everything the other day.
$C: My physics teacher was just talking about him today, saying how he was one of the longest surving victims of ALS. What a damn shame 
$C: Goddamn. Your through the wormhole now man. O7
$C: Rest in peace Hawking.
$C: Damn. That’s truly a loss for us all. 
$C: RIP. A true role model that I looked up to. Whatever interest I have now in science and space now is because of him and his book-A Brief History of Time. 
$C: It's a sad, sad day gents. He pops up all the time on various news feeds I get. I hope he's up there talking to the greats, and waiting for the day when he, Elon, and Richard B. can fly together among the stars.
$C: Wow. I didn't think this would hit me like it has. Such a brilliant mind and great sense of humor.  He'll be missed by many. 
$C: Oddly enough my mind finds this news hard to believe. Science without Mr. Hawking? Unimaginable. 
$C: Rest in peace professor Hawking, you lived a life more fulfilling than most and yet its still sad to see you go.

A mind so brilliant one might think that it would never extinguish, good bye. 
$C: We have lost one of The greatest minds of a generation, possibly of a century, today. He may be dead, but his memory and his impact will be felt for millennia, if we survive that long.
$C: The man was instrumental in digging me out of my depression and inspiring me to go to college. The way he communicated science helped me realize just how beautiful and wonderfully complex the universe is. He made a difference in so many peoples lives, and he will be missed. 
$C: One of the most important people of the past 100 years. Thank you for your service to mankind
$C: It is quite an honor for Stephen to occupy the top 7 positions on the Reddit home page. We have lost a great, great man. Long live Stephen Hawking. 
$C: A sad day for science, may he rest in peace.
$C: He will go down as one of the most influential humans in human history. 

I'm not a scientist, but he sure was inspirational.
$C: He now knows the answers to all the mysteries. 
$C: Now he knows if there’s a god or not 
$C:  There goes one of the greatest minds in human history. 
$C: The world has just lost one of its brightest minds in ages. Hawking will likely be remembered as a top thinker alongside Einstein or Newton in the decades and centuries to come.
$C: I want to write something poignant and meaningful, but I can't. This caught me completely off-guard. RIP Stephen Hawking, and if there is an afterlife, try and find out the secrets and meaning behind it as well.
$C: It hits really hard. 

I failed you, Hawking, I should have studied Physics instead of International Relations. :(
$C: A genius who fought bravely all his lfe.
$C: Rest in peace, thank you for your great work.
$C: For some reason it didn’t even feel like he was capable of dying. Damn. His memory will live on and he will truly be missed. 
$C: He is now with the stars. 
$C: A still more glorious dawn awaits. 
$C: Craig mack and Steven hawking. Not a good day.
$C: He had such a brilliant mind and was paramount to the development of my love of science. He will be missed.

Thank you for all of your amazing and inspirational contributions, R.I.P. 
$C: His kids book was one of the things that got me interested in science and black holes. RIP, his legacy will be remembered in the countless people he inspired and the work he accomplished in his field. 
$C: oof im only in science class in middle school. I didn’t learn about him yet but he will probably be interesting
$C: Great words:

"Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up." - Stephen Hawking

Goodbye, sir.
$C: End of an era but his legacy will far outlive him. A great mind and an icon. 
$C: His life was both humbling and empowering. I feel lucky to have lived at the same time as one of the greats.
$C: Rest in pice to an inspiration to me and many others
$C: First Billy now Stephen Hawking, FeelsBadMan
$C: RIP Stephen Hawking, it is a sad day indeed. I have much admiration for him. He helped open my eyes. 
$C: I instantly burst into tears the second I saw this post.

I don't know how to explain it, but Stephen Hawking's existence has been a comfort to me for many years. As someone who struggles to understand a lot of principles in science, and who deeply worries about the future of humanity.. I've always just felt calmed by the fact that there was someone out there who had a truly brilliant mind, who could make some sense of all of those scary science-y theories, and whose entire life was dedicated to understanding what I cannot. 

It sounds dumb, but knowing that Stephen Hawking was studying all that shit and working hard to learn more about the universe just kinda made me feel like everything was going to be okay.

Now, I feel a bit hopeless. I know that there are so many other smart people in the world, who are studying the very same things.. But Hawking was uniquely inspiring. His very survival overcame so many odds, not to mention the leaps and bounds he was able to make for the scientific community. 

RIP Stephen.
$C: It’s turtles all the way down. Privileged to have lived in the same time as Dr. Hawking. 
$C: RIP.  The human race just lost a good one.
$C: This is a sad day, as we will always remember Hawking’s contributions to mankind. May he rest in peace, and his work carry on through his legacy.
$C: Rest in piece, it was a long, hard fought battle and I'm happy we were able to learn so much from him while he was here.

Although ima be honest, I didn't know he was even still alive.
$C: the world is genuinely worse without him, rest in piece, i know i wasn’t the only one inspired by you when i was young 
$C: Death is absolutely crazy dude wtf
$C: To the r/science mods ... I hope you all have a place to grieve. I imagine this is a tough time to do your modding duties. Thank you.
$C: There is before Stephen Hawking and after Stephen Hawking
$C: "Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. 
It matters that you don't just give up." 

After spending the last few days struggling while studying for my Organic Chemistry final, I saw someone post this in a thread recently. I will now try my absolute hardest. 
$C: I was about to lay down and sleep now im gonna twist one up to celebrate his life.  /rtrees
$C: Ah, a shame really.  I'm not the only one here who was inspired long ago from his nice work "A Brief History of Time".  He had both a flair for writing and research.
$C: Not the news I was expecting this morning.

He was a great personality and mind and will be truly missed.
$C: RIP: Thank you for making us think about aliens and instilling us with fear of ourselves. Super sad at this.
$C: I study gravitational theory and Hawking was a huge inspiration for me. The world mourns his loss.
$C: Rest in peace Mr. Hawking . Thanks for your inspiration and great devotion to science.
$C: Made such a contribution to humanity. Never be forgotten. RIP
$C: This day is going to be a point stuck in time for me for the rest of my life. I have spent the last 8 or so years of my life pursuing physics. With another step on my ladder by earning my bachelor's degree in applied physics, I looked up to him as somewhat of a end goal. And it saddens me to no end that this person who changed the entire course of my adult life. And the way I fundamentally look at the world around me. Will never get to hear the endless amount of praise I could bestow upon him. Although I choose to believe that he has heard it enough times to know that he caused a change in so many young people such as myself that he passed on knowing that he had already done a great amount worth engraving into my soul. Thank you Dr. Hawking. I can't say it enough times. Thank you. 

Edit: I failed English 4 times. As I'm sure you can see.
$C: That's just sad. A true loss to humanity.
$C: I know we're all in mourning, but I just want to point out a funny coincidence. Mr. Hawking died on Pi day, kinda appropriate if you think about it.

$C: A well-known scientist once gave a public lecture on astronomy. He described how the earth orbits around the sun and how the sun, in turn, orbits around the center of a vast collection of stars called our galaxy. At the end of the lecture, a little old lady at the back of the room got up and said: "What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant tortoise." The scientist gave a superior smile before replying, "What is the tortoise standing on?" "You're very clever, young man, very clever," said the old lady. "But it's turtles all the way down!" - A Brief History of Time
$C: I'll never forget that Family Guy episode.
$C: I think this is the first time I've actually shed a tear when a famous person died. This man was such an inspiration.
$C: Death to him would just be another experiment into the unknown what an incredible man. 
$C: Damn.    
Of all the celebrity deaths of the past few years, this one definitely hits me the hardest. I've spent time wrapping my had around some of his brilliant theories. I never met the man, but damned if I'm not going to miss the hell out of him.
$C: Idk if he meant to do that but I always thought Stephen Hawking looked happy in that wheelchair.
$C: One of the greatest minds, if not the greatest, to ever live on this planet.  Rest in Peace, Dr. Hawking.  We will never forget what you've given us.
$C: No no no no no no no no no no
$C: [removed]
$C: I read his book, "A Brief History of Time" a few years ago, and enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would.

He was a very inspiring person, and will be missed.
$C: In a world that craves for attention and fame, people like him often get no recognition and rewards but that never dithers them from paving their way through the unknown and we as a society should be grateful for it.
$C: Greatest mind of our time? Not sure I can think of anyone even remotely close 
$C: I'm holding fast to the idea that he unified general relativity and quantum mechanics and immediately ascended to a higher dimensional plane.
$C: he will be a beacon of hope and understanding for generations to come.
$C: "A tragedy has befallen all mankind"
$C: The world has lost a great man and role model for the scientific community. Words cannot express the loss that this world has just experienced. The contributions he made were phenomenal. Rest is peace Mr. Hawking
$C: His contributions to our advancement as a  were unprecedented. Against all odds, Stephen Hawking managed to live far beyond the span people usually do suffering from his condition, and maintained not only a coherent channel of communication, but he wrote books, starred in documentaries and interviews, and inspired countless people to go into STEM and study the universe. He will be missed.
$C: If I have seen further, it is by standing on [the shoulders of giants](https://cdn-zenpencils.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014-06-03-scientistsnew.jpg). 

Today we've lost another one. May his spirit continue to inspire others. 

RIP 1942-2018

$C: He introduced me to the magnificent world of science when i was young. Still this day, i love science more than anything. He is the first “celebrity” death to actually affect me deeply the way it did. He will be missed xx
$C: I can only hope he chose cryopreservation. There's so much he has to see. https://amp.theguardian.com/science/2013/sep/21/stephen-hawking-brain-outside-body
$C: Have we tried turning him off and back on again? 
$C: That's rough news to hear. Damn.
$C: A few days ago, I was talking with an old woman about Christianity and religion. She said that professor Hawking had Als because he had left God, and the evil was poisoning him. I think that religion is like a cancer. It makes me really depressed that people like her has that opinion of a man who made awesome contributions to this world. I believe we need more Hawkings and less fanaticism.
$C: rest in peace Mr. Hawking. we will miss you
$C: A truly significant loss for humanity. Someone who inspired so many. Rest in peace my friend. You've earned it. 
$C: What a great man, humanity as a whole has lost something precious. 

He may not have been religious, but I will pray that this embodiment of genius finds great bliss in the after world.
$C: wow i must be getting old to live to see the day the man the myth the legend steven hawking died.
$C: I just checked reddit before bed and saw this. It's incredibly sad to hear, I've never thought of a world without him. Rest in peace. 
$C: My heart dropped when I saw the news. I've never much cared for science, but Hawking made me more interested in it than I've ever been. Rest in peace, we will always remember you. Thank you for everything that you did while alive.
$C: Rest in peace, a true legend.


May you already found all the answers you wanted on the other side sir.
$C: I truly hope he went out doing a 900 Christ Air like god intended
$C: And back to the stars.
$C: Much respect to a brilliant man. RIP
$C: His intro to the 'The Story of Everything' is badass

CHECK. IT. OUT.

https://youtu.be/rsoQ5WQefWA
$C: His passing has left an intellectual vacuum in his wake. But it's not empty. Think of it as a kind of vacuum energy permeating the fabric of spacetime that defies measure. Stephen Hawking, RIP 1942-2018.
$C: And we never did figure out what this was, did we??? Here is Stephen Hawking's mysterious pictures in NY Time Square - https://i.imgur.com/ZIgDvOa.jpg
$C: His life is such a great source for inspiration, motivation and discipline. It demonstrates the "limitless" capabilities of the human, if it is tuned the right way. Rest in peace.
$C: R.i.p. mr. Hawking. I truly hope he found the truth he was searching for.  My grandmother passed away from ALS so it was nice to always have someone fight it as long as he did. 

Miss you both now. :(
$C: I wonder if he will get a statue or monument in honor of his great work.
$C: Anybody remember that episode of dexters lab when he went and visited that Stephen Hawking stand in.  Me too,  me too.
$C: This is so sad. He voiced some of the strongest opinions I’ve heard in recent times. May his presence have a forever resounding effect on us, Rest In Peace Mr. Hawking.
$C: Probably one of the biggest losses of this century, perhaps even of this millennia. Rest in peace, Mr. Hawking. You will never  be forgotten.
$C: Omg, i can't believe it, just read the news... wow
$C: *It doesn't have to be like this*

*All we need to do is make sure we keep talking*
$C: Maybe he knew something we don't and chose his time to leave.   Space is one big black hole and it just got bigger.   R.I.P Professor Hawking.
$C: His was a truly brilliant mind, and he will be sorely missed. :(
$C: A monumental loss for our entire species. 
$C: Goodbye, Doctor Hawking. 
$C: This is incredibly sad.

The King is dead, Long live the King...
$C: Rest in Peace, Dr. Hawking. You have inspired countless millions of people to look into the vast depths of the universe and to wonder if there is more out there to life. Thank you for all that you have done for humanity.
$C: RIP Mr. Hawking ~ we will continue to stand on the shoulders of giants such as yourself.
$C: He didn't die.. He just unfolded. 
$C: He did so much. Inspired many. His memory and work will live on.
$C: The universe just lost the greatest mind, the stars are crying. Rest in Peace.
$C: They should knight him
$C: Did he really die? I only see this on the first 4 top posts.
$C: Stephen Hawking inspired a sense of wonder about the universe into a whole generation through his public outreach efforts, which is partly to blame for my own pursuit of physics.  If we could all even just poorly approximate his enthusiasm and curiosity for what yet remains unknown, the world would be so much better for it.  RIP
$C: Well shit, I was tipsy and happy. A more important man than me has died and I’m sad. 
$C: Unbelievable, no matter how much I knew this day would come.
$C: It‘s sad to know that one of the most brilliant minds of our time now passed away. But it is astonishing how long Hawking lived considering he was diagnosed with a young age and told that he only had a few years left. Nevertheless it‘s still a shame especially considering that he will never receive a nobel prize for all the insights he provided. 

May he never be forgotten
$C: A huge loss. Sad news today.

I've always wondered. Did he have to do all his physics math entirely in his mind? At a certain point he would have no longer been able to write anything down.
$C: A brilliant mind who shined through his adversity, inspiring generations. RIP Professor.
$C: There goes one of my three.  Three people who I can’t imagine the world without, but they’re so old, the time is coming sooner than later.  (Mel Brooks and John Williams are the other two).
$C: We really are in the darkest timeline
$C: Such a heartbreaking loss. As someone who stands as an advocate for science and education, it's crushing to even read the headline. This man stands as a testament to so many things: science, determination, health, awareness, and everything in between. 

His contributions to the world surely will not be forgotten. Rest in peace, Dr. Hawking. 
$C: He was amazing and inspiring for many reasons, not the least of which was his ability to relate to people. I especially loved seeing him on TNG then reading about how fun it was for him. He was one of the good ones — we’ll miss you, Dr. Hawking
$C: He may not radiate life anymore, but his theory of hawking radiation lives on. We'll miss your brilliant mind. Thanks for your inspiration.
$C: RIP you were and always will be well loved. 
$C: 
“I have noticed even people who claim everything is predestined, and that we can do nothing to change it, look before they cross the road.” - Stephen Hawking 1942-2018. Truer words are rarely said, and even more rarely describe this absolutely breathtaking amount of grief that comes with this news about an absolutely monumental figure. Rest In Peace Mr. Hawking.
$C: He managed to survive ALS for 55 years and be one of the most celebrated scientists of our time. That's a hell of run if I've ever heard of it. Incredible.

RIP
$C: He is one of my biggest inspirations. Such an incredible mind in such a complicated body. I hope we can continue to propel science forward and strive for truth in it
$C: We lost of great man today. On this day Einstein was born, and we celebrate Pi day. But now we mourn the loss of another great scientist. RIP Stephen Hawking. 
$C: Return to the space dust from which we came. Reunite with Carl in whatever might lie beyond.

Thank you for your brilliance.
$C: I need a "candle in the wind" cover by Mc. Hawking to find closure 
$C: nooooooooooooo[ooooooooo worst timeline!!!!
$C: I know it’s silly but idk I just didn’t ever think he’d go, that sucks. Such a brilliant mind and put up a hell of a fight against ALS. May he Rest In Peace 
$C: And so another brilliant mind joins the cosmos.
$C: He will live on in those that he inspired
$C: Responsible for convincing me of atheism and making me free. Will be missed!
$C: I am missing Sheldon's reaction on this...he will be devastated I presume...
$C: “If I had to choose a superhero to be, I would pick Superman. He’s everything that I’m not.”

I remember sitting down as a kid/teen with my parents to watch a BBC documentary presented by Steven Hawking. The way he explained it completely drew me in and made me fall in love with science. Even as someone who thought they weren't anywhere near smart enough to be a scientist and didn't pay attention to 'science stuff', I was captivated by it. 

I can genuinely say Steven Hawking was one of the most influential people in shaping my interests and passions as an adult.
$C: Rest in peace good sir. The world just became a darker more ignorant place today 
$C: This is a significantly sad day for our time in history. To live and be present during his lifetime was the true honor. May he be preserved in time as one of the greatest minds of our timeline and may his name conditioned to live on with honor and admiration.
$C: Wasn’t he just a regular physicist
$C: I was hoping this was a hoax. I know to have lived as long as he did with ALS was nothing short of a miracle in and of itself, but somehow I just always thought he'd live forever.
$C: The world is truly a lesser place without him. It is now up to all of us to make sure his work and memory is never forgotten
$C: This man inspired a generation. 
He helped me conceive all the beauty and wonders of the cosmos. RIP you legend. 
$C: Gonna miss you Steve.  Not like I expect you to somehow read this Reddit forum.  But I don't know how else to say it.  Rest in peace.
$C: As a kid I hated science... maybe because I had to learn it, but I hated it!! Fast forward to 30 years old and I love anything science related. My first book I read from Mr Hawking was the grand design and it blew my mind!! R.I.P.
$C: "My goal is simple. It is a complete understanding of the universe, why it is as it is and why it exists at all."

History will not forget this man. One of the most important scientists of your generation. RIP. 
$C: I will miss his enigmatic computer voice. It was objectively sweet. He also made the impossible possible. But at the same time, he lived a long and rough life with ALS.

Now he can rest in peace and do anything he wants, with all the stars shining for him.

RIP mate. It was a fun ride.
$C: Very sadden by this news, really really devastating news.
$C: I was shocked to hear about this, then I thought about it and smiled knowing he made it so much longer than anyone would have thought and was able to contribute in a way many can only dream of, not letting his ALS get in the way.  Then I go on Facebook and the first comment I read about his passing is someone saying "And now he will know there is a god". 

We still have a long ways to go. 

You will be missed Professor! 
$C: Stephen Hawking dies on National Pie Day 🤨
$C: One of the most brilliant minds we never deserved. I’m thankful to have lived at the same time as him and thankful he has led us to so many discoveries about how we understand the universe. His books are phenomenal if you haven’t read them and do a great job explaining so many aspects of space and time. RIP Stephen Hawking, you will be missed. 
$C: Honestly I never thought of him dying. Just assumed he'd become some kind of sentient AI base or something 
$C: Stephen Hawking,
Who Examined the
Universe and Explained
Black Holes, Dies at 76
A physicist and best-selling author, Dr. Hawking did not
allow his physical limitations to hinder his quest to answer
“the big question: Where did the universe come from?”
$C: Shoobity doobity doo that's professior Hawk!
$C: I'm a TV news producer. The science nerd in me is honored and proud to say that I was able to break this news on national TV in the US. The networks are all busy covering the special election in Pennsylvania, but I convinced my executive producer that it was worth us taking a minute out of that coverage to tell the news of Stephen Hawking's passing. It is one of the proudest minutes of television that I've ever produced. Rest in peace, professor.
$C: “One, remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Two, never give up work. Work gives you meaning and purpose, and life is empty without it. Three, if you are lucky enough to find love, remember it is there and don’t throw it away.” RIP
$C: This day has had it's ups and downs, but this is the worst part yet...
$C: rest in peace lil man
$C: My heart broke at the thought of such a great mind departing this world
$C: “The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge.” 

- Stephen Hawking
$C: He updated a paper on arxiv only last week: “a smooth exit from cosmic inflation”.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07702
$C: Rest in peace, he was the greatest mind of our generation, and its a huge loss to see him go. He will go on forever not just with all of the knowledge he imparted, but also In all of the unread but often owned A Brief History of Time's. He once called it the most unread, most owned book.
$C: R.I.P Stephen Hawking
$C: I don't have a big interest in science but for me, he is an inspiration for overcoming his monstrous disability / illness. 
$C: So sad. Rest in peace to a man who contributed so much to science, and all of society.
$C: This man was a legend and had a great passion for science and the well-being of mankind. He will forever be missed. RIP. 
$C: Can you imagine how Sheldon will react on the Big Bang Theory? A loss for science, and a loss for humor as well.
$C: Given only 2 more years to live back in 1962.
Dies aged 76.
If this ain't badass idk what is 
$C: 20 years from now it'll be really cool telling our kids and grandkids about this man.
$C: He was one of the most extraordinary humans we know of. 
$C: The world is a little less, rip
$C: Earlier today my friend was joking that Stephen Hawking was dead and the machine has just been pretending to be him for a while. And now he’s dead and the joke isn’t so funny.
$C: Damn dude RIP. He was one of those absolute legends that seemed like they were bound to die any day now, but nobody actually expected them to.
$C: Look up to the sky today, people. Wonder where we came from.

I just can’t imagine the depth of a mind like Hawking’s. I will never be able to grasp the concepts he so eloquently expressed in his writing.
$C: RIP Stephen Hawking. He was my inspiration to major in Astronomy at uni. A great loss to humanity.
$C: Thanks for all your hard work
$C: Pie Day no longer has the same meaning. RIP. 
$C: Born on the anniversary of Galileo’s death, Jan 8th. Died on the date of Einstein’s birth, march 14. Time is circular.
$C: Rest In Peace, Sir.
$C: Oh man. I’ve known about this guy almost my whole life as an icon for science, it’s a real shame to see him pass, but he accomplish a whole lot.
$C: Aside from his work, he gave hope to many people who suffer from ALS. RIP Dr. Hawking.
$C: Is it Irony or a sign of providence that today is also Albert Einstein's Birthday! 
$C: was given 2 years to live. he squeezed out 55. not too shabby, Dr. Hawking.
$C: One of my biggest dreams was to meet him and shake his hand. I hope to one day visit his grave and at least lay a flower, and say some kind words. RIP to a good dude, indeed.
$C: A titan falls. Truly a man who will live forever in history.
$C: Rest in Peace, Mr. Hawking. You've lived one helluva life. Thank you for everything you have done.
$C: A life well lived, you can rest now
$C: oh no, that's terrible. He'll never be forgotten
$C: I hope heaven is wheelchair accessible 
$C: It's crazy to hear this. 
$C: Thank You Steven for advancing humanity with a greater understanding of our universe. Thank you for awakening my mind to the beauty of science.
$C: big bang theory show will not be the same anymore.  RIP
$C: God speed you sweet man!
$C: At least he’s not in a wheelchair anymore! 
$C: I don't know what to say. It feels... weird knowing this. A part of me wants to reject this completely. But Rest in peace. One of the greatest mind ls to exist.
$C: Rest in peace Dr Hawking.
$C: I don't know what to say, what a great loss to humanity and science. He was one of the brightest minds the british nation gave to the world. A truly sad day.
$C: Rest in peace, Professor.
$C: I aspire to one day hold even a ounce of this man's scientific prowess. Godspeed, sir. 
$C: Does anyone know cause of death? Hope it was a peacegul death and not much pain or suffering. He lived such a long life despite his disorder! Pretty sure he survivied nearly to average male life expectany! 
$C: I am very sad about this, not surprised he pushed on for a long time. But hot damn, it's so sad when one of the greatest minds in the world departs. 
$C: Stephen Hawking was an amazing man not just because he was a genius, not just because his imagination had no limits, but because he had a great sense of humor. He'll always be remembered as the second Einstein, but it's our job to keep his memory as a really great, humorous and generous man alive.


$C: RIP Mr. Hawking 
$C: The passing of Stephen Hawking was something I never thought that I'd see in my time. He was much older than me, but he somehow seemed beyond it. It's a massive loss for humanity. 
$C: we lost one of the most valuable gems we ever had.
$C: He proved to us that even black holes die. Eternity may end, but dreams last forever. Here's to the brightest star.
$C: Anyone get a chance to preserve his brain so we upload him to the mainframe at some point in the future?
$C: Science has lost one of its greatest men, now he rests with his colleagues in peace. 😢
$C: Damn he lived a long time. I honestly didn't even know he was that old. The world lost a legend today.
$C: I loved him. He was an inspiration for me, for everyone. We can't ever do him justice, he gave us so much. Hope we all astrophysics majors will be able to do even a fraction of what he did. RIP Stephen Hawking. 
$C: I feel like the world has gotten a bit dimmer. I need a hug.
$C: A true legend. He will be missed.
$C: Rest in Peace, Mr. Hawking. 
$C: I'm seeing a lot of inspirational quotes on this page but does anybody know what his actual last words are? I don't mean literal spoken words but whatever he says using his synthesizer
$C: The earth is less brilliant 
$C: Growing up I would joke because we share the same birthday along with Elvis and David Bowie, my name also happens to be Stephen. As an adult I've always given him the shout out on our birthday over the others.

My next birthday just got a little more sad.

$C: During just a random reload of the reddit homepage and I see this. I gotta say, it felt somewhat surreal for a moment. I knew he was an older gentleman and had an illness and I know nothing lives forever but, I just never expected it to happen. 

I saw it and just thought, *Oh*. That's it. I was in total shock and that's all that I could say. He made such an impact on the world and, I'm just repeating myself here but, I just never expected it to happen. R.I.P Dr. Hawking, you made such an impact on this world that I don't think you'll ever truly die anytime soon. You'll be remembered as long as humans exist.
$C: Looks like I gotta lay off the Hawking jokes for a while...
$C: I am not even a scientist and I don't know why I feel so sad, I feel like we have lost someone really important to us. RIP.
$C: He has accomplished  a lot, but it's a shame that he's now dead and can't do anymore. 
$C: Nothing but respect for the man. You'll be sorely missed Dr. Hawkins, you were an inspiration for generations, and will be for generations to come.
$C: Rest in peace you brilliant man. Thank you for all you've done for humanity.

I hope you find happiness in the afterlife, should there be one.
$C: Going to miss this man. Very much so. 
$C: If we had a chance he would be the first one ever who is sent into a black hole at his funeral. RIP.
$C: Nooooooo! Take Bill Nye!!!
$C: Wow. I really can't believe that he's gone. I've looked up to him for so long. I'm crushed. RIP. Thank you for inspiring me as well as many other young minds to learn about science. 
$C: The idol who inspired me the most. I am very sad :(
$C: RIP Dr Hawking. You'll be missed by generations upon generations... :(
$C: Hawking was one og the few that could unite thousands in the strive for knowledge. He held a lecture a few years back here in Denmark, and it was livestreamed to cinemas all over the country. Sold out everywhere. 
He was an inspiration to all and he made his field something that the public wanted to learn about. 
$C: I really don't know much about Hawking, but this ruined my day already.
$C: In an infinite number of universes, somewhere there is an infinite Hawking. 

Ever the scientist, he has proved it is not this one. 
$C: I really didn't expect this. Incredible man through and through. Rip. 
$C: All I can say is that him and his robot are in a better place now. Rest in piece Stephen. You will be missed.
$C: As someone who did not know much about his discoveries, can someone give me a list of all his accomplishments? 
$C: While I have not followed a career in science, I continue to follow a life long interest in it which was in part inspired by Professor Hawking. Apart from his direct impact on humanity through his work in science I think his ultimate impact through the inspiration of others is beyond measure and will never be truly known. He has been the face of science to many and just as many have considered him the pinnacle of intelligence. I cannot speak to the validity of these claims for all I know is that his intelligence was beyond mine, as was his work ethic, sense of humor and outlook on life.  No matter your situation, it can be improved through emulation of Professor Hawking.
$C: An awful day for sure. Such a brilliant mind now lost.
$C: I feel somewhat unsafe, since he died.
$C: When i was having breakfast, i thoight about black holes and because of that about Stephen Hawkings. I said to myself that he is already pretty old and thought how it would be if he died.
Half an hour later i check twitter and see that he actually died.

$C: This is so extremely sad.  He was my idol for as long as I remember, simply because every part of him was amazing. He could explain complicated theories to most everyone, he was ambitious and funny. And even a disease that assured that he’d die early couldn’t hold him back from becoming possibly the most important scientist of the century. 
$C: Such a shame... I had all his records. 
$C: Truly an inspiration to all who will be sorely missed. His legacy will forever live on in the advancement of both our understanding of the universe and mankind's role in the cosmos.
$C: He’s up there flying with the Tesla Spaceman now.
$C: I wish the best for his family and loved ones
$C: One of the persons who got me interested in physics. A great loss indeed but his enormous contributions to science and popularizing science among masses will be remembered forever. He was and forever will be a hero.
$C: A true hero of it's time and beyond. 
$C: The universe is truly vast and ancient. I am so fortunate that I shared the same time and space as Dr. Hawking. You will be missed. Thank you for all of your contributions to humanity.
$C: Wow this is so sad RIP to a true genius 
$C: So sad that he’s passed away. But he lived a long life, and lived a lot longer than doctors thought he would. His condition never stopped him from achieving amazing things. He was truly a remarkable person.
$C: [removed]
$C: So sad, he was born after one world war ended and died before the next began. RIP
$C: RIP man, he lived an amazing life, despite having ALS, he defied all expectations. What an amazing man in the name of science. :(
$C: When I was 13 I read Stephen Hawkings A Brief History of Time. That, along with Neil degrasse Tyson’s Cosmos documentary, were my early inspirations to become a physicist. I’m almost done high school and plan to major in physics. I cannot say I would want to study that field if it weren’t for him. Thank you and Rest In Peace
$C: A very sad day indeed. May he rest in peace and forever be an inspiration to all of us.
$C: It is fitting that it’s Pi Day. A day were the geeks among us already come together and celebrate intelligence. We can now also come together in mourning a lost hero.
$C: It's a sad day when the world loses one of it's greatest intellects. Damn this guy was my inspiration. 
$C: dang such a great mind lost. RIP. i should get around to finally reading his book
$C: Wonder how long until the world sees another mind of his caliber. RIP and heartfelt condolences to those nearest to him.
$C: Einstein's last words were lost as he spoke them in german to an English speaking nurse. Now we also do not know about Hawkings last thoughts.
$C: Hey 2018, fuck you man.
$C: Rip mr hawkings....thank you for your contributions towards humanity. It will be forever immortalized and you will always be remembered as one of the best of humanity.
$C: I remember him saying ''Heaven is a fairytale for people afraid of the dark''. From atoms to atoms, from energy to energy. In the comparatively short time, he did something great.
$C: "I believe the simplest explanation is, there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realization that there probably is no heaven and no afterlife either. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe and for that, I am extremely grateful."

- Stephen Hawking

$C: Just turned on the radio, whiter shade of pale playing, open the reddit app, see this and cry.
$C: He played a part in last week's new hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy. It made me smile that he wanted to do that stuff.  What a legend ! RIP
$C: Ripb you legendary figure
$C: I'm genuinely saddened by this to a degree I wouldn't have expected. I don't think I ever appreciated the symbol that he was. Not just for science but for a love of life. I feel some semblance of "survivors remorse", this is a man who latched on to every ounce of life he was told he wouldn't have. He dedicated all of that time, and that life to doing what he loved and trying to improve the world. I don't think anything has made me appreciate life more than the death of someone who recognized and cherished life's true value. This news is saddening but in some ways reinvigorating. I want to spend more time pursuing my dreams and improving the world around me, I want to adventure and I want to make myself and others smile a lot more often. For the first time in what seems like a very long time, I can confidently say I am happy to be alive. 

This came to mind while writing this and in a lot of ways reminds me of Stephen Hawking: [Final C&H strip](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/owAFv) 

$C: also on einsteins birthay ;o
$C: Whether it's ninety years,  or nine hundred billion years, there will never be enough time spent and have had with the people you want in your life. Only those you no longer desire or ever desired, will you ever sense a satisfactory frame of time spent together. 
$C: I came across [this] (https://imgur.com/gallery/Q9jlO) tonight while finding magazine images for my art project...
$C: Saw this and it made me pause.

As a disabled person, he was one of my heroes.

Rest in Peace, Dr. Hawking.
$C: RIP to the man with an IQ of 280. 

https://youtu.be/OH8s4N15zdg
$C: He didnt die. He just ran out of batteries
$C: Tis a sad day for science, RIP
$C: Interesting thing to note, it's pi day today and the next pi day might be recognized as the day Stephen Hawking passed away
$C: Man, I did not want to start my day crying :( This was somehow so unexpected
$C: This guy was a legend and a great influence. He will be missed by all, and for generations. 
$C: Saddening to see a "science Hall of Fame" member just die. So soon. 

Now I understand what every person felt for the past 3000 years, when someone that really  formed science in their own field just goes to heavens.

I hope he will teach the people up there about what he has done during his life.

Rest in Peace, Professor!
$C: [removed]
$C: I actually have no idea how to feel about this, I'm malfunctioning 

Guys what does this mean for the future of science or the future of anything? 
$C: Can’t believe he died . . . but now the massive solar storm makes a little more sense. He’s free now, riding the solar winds to who knows where.
$C: He was a personal inspiration to me, not only in the field of science but also in life. His attitude and approach to life really gave me comfort in my lowest of lows. You will be missed Mr. Hawking
$C: RIP one of the most influential minds of our time
$C: Always inspirational. While its a terrible loss, his life was a tremendous net positive for our world. We still don’t. know how much of an impact he has truly had.


On a sorta too soon and unrelated note, I wonder how the rights to his voice will be handled.
$C: He was an idol of mine,im truly sad,rest in peace steve.
$C: Yet his talking, astrophysicist computer will live on forever!
$C: For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals
Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination
We learned to talk
$C: [A still more glorious dawn awaits,](https://youtu.be/zSgiXGELjbc)

not a sunrise, but a galaxy-rise.

A morning filled with a hundred billion suns;

the rising of the milky way.
$C: I wish I knew how he exists right now. Just, the truth of it all.
$C: He won't be insulting anyone anymore it seems.
$C: Fuck really I thought he was younger than that.
$C: Wow, RIP. I was looking into books to read today, and one of his came across my attention, and I morbidly thought "I wonder how much longer he will be with us." This was literally 8 hours ago. Very strange to get on Reddit and see this news. He was an invaluable mind in Science.
$C: Einstein’s birthday and now Hawking’s death day 
$C: I'm pretty sure a fair number of us agree on this statement but, Thank you Dr. Hawking for all of your work, your strength, and for your natural ability to inspire a burning desire in numerous scientists, science enthusiasts, and the rest of the general public, into striving for the scientific truth, regardless of the depths of its difficulty, and our situations. Rest in peace, one of my greatest heroes, and enjoy the cosmos you brilliant bastard :')

P.S. I enjoyed reading your thesis, Properties of Expanding Universes. I highly recommend this read to anyone that wants to have even the slightest idea of his brilliance.
$C: Being given only 2 years to live at the age of 22 to then go and live a life to the age of 76 is crazy. I can not have anything but respect for a man like that. 

I hope he rests in peace.
$C: I am just glad I was able to be alive and hear his ideas in person. Live on forever Stephen.
$C: Boom de yada boom de yada.
$C: I don't really keep up with celebrities so most big deaths are ones I can't really care about.

But this is somebody whose importance and contributions I can truly appreciate, and I can genuinely feel sad about this. 
$C: He will not be forgotten 
$C: See Steven in Sydney, broadcast by hologram from Cambridge University. Will always remember it. On behalf of mankind, thank you Steven.
$C: Coincidentally, I was working through my particle physics homework when I found out about this. 
Aside from being one of the greatest modern physicists, he was a true example of courage and fortitude (something I feel physicists need more than anything else). He inspired me to be a physicist, he inspired countless others, and will continue to do so. What a man! RIP. 
$C: RIP. Kind of a coincidence he left us on a PI(3.14) day
$C: Ah, man. There's goes our Einstein. 
$C: It's a sad day for humanity and science. 
RIP Mr Hawking. 
$C: Stephen I love you man, you will live on in our hearts and minds.



I feel like humanity just lost a Captain of the ship, and we are but a simple minded bunch of seamen and seawomen adrift the ocean of the present and future, with one fewer knowledgeable guide to help us stay on course.



Good luck humanity, we are one less Einstein once again.




$C: When they said he died in London, my first thought was.. what was he doing there?  I never realized he was British.
$C: I named my cat Hawking because he looks like a black hole. Goodbye Stephen. 
$C: Wow such a shock to loose a brilliant mind!
$C: I was shocked by this news, and it is sad, but he lived a very fulfilling life. He inspired so many people and did so much for science. He'll be sorely missed by so many people. 

RIP Stephen Hawking
$C: I saw him in person about 25 years ago. He took questions from the audience and responded with great wit, delighting the audience -- all with what I thought was astonishing speed on his speech device. What a treat it was.
$C: Ugh, so saddened by his death. This is such a huge loss to the world of science, physics and people who always saw the best in life. His warnings, his values, his mind. 
$C: Rest in peace sweet genius
$C: I was seriously hoping the title was just a lie.

I realize it’s not and I don’t know what to feel.
$C: The NY Times obituary was great: https://nytimes.com/2018/03/14/obituaries/stephen-hawking-dead.html
$C: A Post Stephen Hawkins world... one can only wonder the amount of things he was yet to discover and share with us. I am glad he has motivated so many minds. I can only wish for them to carry his legacy 
$C: I bet those time travelers wish they showed up now.
$C: Posting in scientific history. :(
$C: This is the only death of a famous person that actually made me sad since David Bowie. RIP Stephen. Thank you for your hard work and all your contribution to humanity. 
$C: I have no smart quote of him, but he was a great man and an incarnation of hope. May he rest in peace.
$C: What a massive loss to the search of scientific truth, and at a time when society needs it most. RIP Stephen!
$C: Hawking, died on PI day. RIP
$C: wow. Physics is the holy grail.
Us humans are so incredible.
Stephen you did well.
$C: Goodbye Stephen Hawking.

I'll never be able to see you, but the fact that your intelligence will outlast your life longer then you did, I'm happy but also in some tears.
$C: He was synonymous with genius, breaking new ground, profundity and beating the odds. A true icon of modern times and I'm glad i get to say i was alive at the same time as he was. I missed Galileo, Newton, Einstein, Curie and all those other names which scream science, but i get to say I was alive when Hawking was. Finally you may rest in peace, free of the shackles of your body. Sleep well you beautiful man.
$C: It's honestly amazing he made it this long. Sad to see him finally leave us.
$C: Damn. Sad news to wake up too. Given so few years to live he defied all odds and achieved so much.
$C: I really hope the Brits give him a national state funeral, sounds crazy I know but I feel like he such a monumental figure in modern British history
$C:  'It would not be much of a universe if it wasn't home to the people you love.'  RIP Stephen Hawking
$C: This is a sad day, such an inspirational person gone. Rest in peace
$C: Rest in peace Dr. Hawkings
$C: Press F to pay respect
$C: Back to a universe he understood more than the rest of us.  God particle speed Prof. Hawkins.
$C: Quietly into the night. 
$C: One of the greatest minds of our time. I am so grateful for the inspiration and knowledge he gave the world. He will be missed. May he rest in peace.
$C: As 13 year olds in school one of us secured a copy of the brief history of time, this was in India back in 1998. It was a life changing moment, not sure if we understood all of it but it kindled our quest for learning more and inspired us  to  pursue science and love physics. Some or my friends went on to become academicians and researchers.

After Carl Sagan, he inspired millions and despite of his own physical limitations. Today I will drink to one of the smartest minds we have ever known. Thank you Dr Hawking.
$C: what a sad day. condolences to his family and friends.
$C: I was discussing about ALS with someone today and brought up the mortality of Stephen Hawking. Oh god I feel so weird. :(
$C: Thank You Stephen, you changed mankind forever, and will stand among the greats, alongside the likes of Asimov and Einstein (who's birthday is today).

Live Long And Prosper.
$C: The world has lost one of the greatest minds of our times. 

Rest in peace Stephen Hawking
$C: "For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals
Then something happenend which unleashed the power of our imagination
We learned to talk" (taken from Pink Floyd's 'Keep Talking', where Stephen Hawking took a part in the recording)
RIP
$C: Wooooooooow. Rest in peace. Fuck now I'm sad
$C: We are all better people for knowing him. He leaves one hell of a legacy. R.I.P.
$C: Rest In Peace Steve Hawking 
$C: Good bye, Hawking Radiation. I'll miss your explanation of Black Hole evaporation.
$C: Rest In Peace, Stephen Hawking (1942-2018). The cosmos will never be the same without you. You may have died but your image, your glory, and your legacy will continue to live on forever in the highest echelons of human achievement. The Isaac Newton of our times has left us but the greatest thinkers of the future will only feel the thrill of looking back on the decades of scientific knowledge that your existence has illuminated and invoke your name the same way that we now, invoke the names of the giants of science, in great reverence of the brilliancy of wit that it will forever symbolize. I tip my hat in great gratitude to the lines of thought you encouraged and the culture of science that you have inspired and recognize the bleakness of a world without your example. Rest In Peace, Great Dreamer. May you live on in the stars you dared dream of.
$C: a beautiful human being
$C: It was a great loss for everyone...
$C: You changed perceptions, defied your own diagnosis and inspired billions. Your knowledge will continue to amaze for generations to come. Truly one of a kind. Thank you. 

May your star shine bright for all of eternity. 
$C: What a loss...but the knowledge he gave us.
$C: A star went out but a brighter one lit up! He was one of the first scientists I started to look up to in highschool. 
$C: Now who do we bring the aliens to when they tell us to take them to our leader?

RIP.
$C: I always thought it was Stephen Hawkings with an S. Anyone else?
$C: I've never been all that saddened when celebrities or other public figures die, but this thread is making kind of teary eyed. 
$C: Nooooo, he was one of the most inspirational people I'd ever heard. Life threw all it could at him and he still came out on top.
$C: Rest In Peace, you amazing, amazing man. 
I hope you’re a part of the stars that you helped us all fall in love with. Your amazing sense of humour and intelligence will be dearly missed. 
$C: Most people can only dream of impacting the world the way he did, with all the challenges life threw his way. In the end, we are all made of star stuff 💫 
$C: Nonononononononononononononononono! 🙁🙁🙁🙁🙁🙁🙁
$C: He was one of the most loved cosmologists  of the word, we will miss him.  
R.I.P. 
$C: "Get busy living, get busy dying" a great man of few words 
$C: Oh my god. Rest in peace Mr. Hawking
$C: I’m saddened but also happy to see how beloved he is in this community.
$C: Wasn’t Hawking scheduled to go into space eventually? Really depressing that he never got to experience what he spent his whole life studying. 
$C: I was a terrible student in high school. But reading his books made me realize that I didn’t have to be good in science; I just needed to be good at life. 

I ended up with a bachelors in political science and 10+ years of an exciting revolving doors of jobs. Really, it’s amazing at the decisions that face us during our lives. And it takes a community of support and providing generous resources to advance ourselves over time. 


I don’t regret not being dedicated to science. I still love science and read a bit, but I contribute in my own way. Thanks Stephen 
$C: Usually the deaths of famous people leave me  cold, this one doesnt. One of the few truly great people on this planet. RIP. 
$C: RIP you bloody legend! We lost a hero today :_(
$C: Tragic to hear. Though he is gone, his work and inspiration will live on
$C: He lives on in hundreds of young scientists he inspired. The world is a little less bright today, but fortunately he lit up lots of sparks before he left us.

Thank you Mr. Hawking!
$C: Does anyone know what his last words were?
$C: "My expectations were reduced to zero when I was 21. Everything since then has been a bonus". 
$C: His books were monumental in rekindling my love and interest in science and mathematics. Rest in peace.
$C: We have lost a true hero today. Rest in peace. Gone from this earth. Forever printed in the history books, like matter in a black hole. You will be missed.
$C: We've lost an incredibly good scientist, and a man who brought much to our society, despite being so limited. Rest in peace, Steven Hawking. Thank you.
$C: RIP, thanks for all the things you've done for this world.
$C: I'll miss his insights and voice.
$C: [deleted]
$C: One of the best gentleman of this generation.So sad to know he passed away.RIP
$C: Given how quick we are to move on and forget in this turbulent age of (mis)information, I truly hope with my heart that humanity remember him as one of the most brilliant minds of our age, and also that his life story serves as a prime example that regardless what the circumstances of your life may be, you can overcome, achieve and surpass whatever challenges life brings you and rise above.
May you find the answers and explanations for all the questions your curious mind formulated, and may it bring you peace. Rest in peace Stephen. 
$C: I read a brief history of time as a teenager and black holes and baby universes. Along with the the likes of Carl Sagan and John Gribbin, he really turned me on to astrophysics. More than that though, he was a beacon of rationality and critical thinking in a world that seems like it is going mad.

I’ll miss him. He was a real hero.
$C: I have  never been so profoundly saddened by the death of a famous person, truly a gift to the world, he will inspire all of earth's scientists that come after him, like einstein and many others before him, RIP
$C: I thought this guy was going to die for years, but years later I am still really torn up. R.I.P. a beautiful mind.
$C: I remember I hired out his into the universe dvd once and his episode on time travel was incredibly fascinating, amazing watch I highly recommend anyone who's interested to give it a watch. He will be sorely missed, that said he's left us with a lot to contemplate.
$C: Probably going to get buried but I got some feelings to get out so here:

When I was eleven, I wanted to be an astrophysicist. Stephen Hawking was an indispensable reason as to why. When I was twelve, I got picked on for reading his books at school. For my thirteenth birthday, I received tickets to attend one of his lectures at McCaw Hall in Seattle. Even though he was bound to a wheelchair, shortly after that event he was scheduled to go on a zero gravity flight, saying "I want to show that people need not be limited by physical handicaps as long as they are not disabled in spirit." Though my interest in astrophysics and cosmology has waned, Hawking's example of perseverance, and passion for his field of study, kept me searching for my own niche to which my work belongs.

Some of his most influential work proposed that even when something was lost to a black hole, it wouldn't be entirely gone; it's information would still be preserved and radiated out from where it was lost. 

In the same way, there is now a vacuous space among the most influential people of our time. Even though a once-in-a-generation mind and individual have departed, the work of Stephen Hawking will be distributed and enable the next generation of discovery. Wherever we, as a species, arrive in the coming centuries, it will be at least in part due to this man.
$C: You changed the face of science forever

RIP <3
$C: Truly, indeed we have lost a great man today but at the same time we won't let feel bad and down but will cherish all the good moments we had with him and the great contributions made by him, they would be a priceless gift to the makind.
$C: Done so much for mankind RIP
$C: Science isn't about why it's about why not
$C: Imagine writing A Brief History of Time with just your cheek!! RIP Professor Hawking
$C: I doubt another ALS sufferer will ever beat his high score. It must have been his ability to keep his mind active that kept him going for so long.
$C: Rest in Peace. You are a true inspiration of the human spirit.
$C: I have never seen so many mods in one thread just with their own thoughts, a man who truly touched us all.
$C: Was not expecting this... may he Rest In Peace 
$C: A pioneer, an inspiration to millions including me. It just doesn’t feel right that this is happening. Rest in Peace, Stephen.
$C: A sad day for humanity
$C: It's a sad day for all of us
$C: Born on Galileo's death and died on Einstein's birth.
$C: Thank you for your contributions to mankind!
$C: Woke up from a dead sleep to this.

Not sure if I should be sad or just underanding.
$C: It has been an honor, sir !
$C: What an apt day for him to pass, Pi Day. 3.14
$C: Wow.  
I found topics about Universe really fascinating when I first read "A Brief History of Time", although I have no expertise in Physics.  
Cannot believe he is no longer with us now.
$C: Rest in peace sir, your passion and legacy remains with us
$C: I'm glad we were all alive during the same time as Stephen Hawking. What an amazing, amazing man.
$C: I just read that hawking said if he had the chance to meet Newton or Marilyn Monroe, he would choose Monroe

heh this gave me a good laugh, I hope you can find the humor in it even in this sad situation (:
$C: Gotta express my condolences. Who's gonna be the figurehead of the science community now? RIP one of the greatest minds to exist.
$C: This is one of the few times I audibly gasped for a loss such as this.
$C: What a man. Thank you for everything Stephen
$C: I guess now he knows. Or not, as the case may be.
$C: Just found out and came straight to Reddit. I hope he died peacefully. 
$C: He died  on π  3.14 , RIP
$C: It's sad! He was a great scientist and an extraordinary man whose work and legacy will live on for many years.
$C: Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo I actually gasped when I read this
$C: I apologise, I'm not adding much to the discussion. I just wanted to leave a few words for him.

RIP Professor Hawking
$C: The world's most brilliant mind has passed. 

But his legacy will have the way for the next 'Hawking' just as he was the next 'Einstein'.

This man is the reason I love our world and the sky's that surround it. It saddens me deeply, but I look forward to see the children inspired by the next generations 'Hawking'.
$C: A loss for mankind and for science. 
$C: Wow. I really wasn't ready to hear this :(

We're really going to miss him. What an amazing gift to mankind he was.
$C: Genuinely devastated. Cried gross crocodile man-tears! Worse to think my class will grow up only hearing stories as we did Einstein. He was, is and will continue to inspire. 
$C: Am 14, been wanting to become an astrophysicist since 10, having awesome grades, even though my family had a small load of problems : my dad had cancer, my mom had an heart surgery, I was diagnosed type 1 diabetes and recently my dad lost an eye due to work accident. Still with all of those, I’m still interested in physics, space, molecules, atoms, gravity.... I just find these topics so interesting. And Stephen Hawking has been my biggest inspiration all along, I, for sure, will miss him, and I’m certain that it’s going to be the same for many others. 

RIP Stephen Hawking, you have made the world a better place. 
$C: Rest in peace Professor Hawking. A true visionary and genius.
$C: I wonder if any time travelers will come to his funeral.
$C: Stephen Hawking, thank you for everything 
$C: The World loses great things when someone as great as Stephen Hawking passes on. We thank him for his words of wisdom and intelligence, and hope that he finds peace and eternal happiness.
$C: Rest In Peace. Somehow he always seemed eternal to me.
$C: As long as he lived, and as much as he did in that time, I only wish he had lived longer to do more. This is an enormous loss for absolutely everyone.
$C: My 11yr old is a huge fan, teared up when I told him and then made his sisters pause in their playtime for a moment of silence for the worlds smartest man. RIP good sir. 
$C: A great mind in a time when scientists and philosophers are considered alongside modern culture.
$C: Of course he died on pi day, the legend.
$C: When I saw this news, I was hit with a wave of sadness. You will live on in so many people's hearts. Rest in peace.

Conveniant that pi day wanted to be the day of his passing.
$C: So sad to hear that he died this morning. 
$C: This came so soon, but I’m glad he made it so far compared to what was expected.
$C: To infinity and beyond, may you rest in peace Mr Hawking.
$C: Don’t have a great quote that hasn’t already been mention, just here to give a nod of respect and have a drink in honor of the passing of a great man.
$C: I read the headline as Steven Hawking *finally* Dies
$C: We lost a great and important man today. RIP.
$C: Truly inspiring figure. I hope you found all your answers, legend. 
$C: As an AI engineer I don't agree with some of his last statements on artificial intelligence, but beside that, today we lost one of the greatest minds of our era, a great scientist that despite a condition that would have led lesser men to desist kept pushing humanity struggle for knowledge forward.

Thank you Stephen.
$C: And so the world lost one of its greatest mind in this dark hour. Rest in peace Stephen. 
$C: I wasn’t ready for this. RIP. We have lost one of our world’s most brilliant minds. 
$C: R.I.P Stephen Hawking.
$C: He held on until pi day. Well done, sir. 
$C: Does anyone know what his last words were?
$C: I was hoping we'd atleast get to Mars before he goes. 
$C: I’m never going to be able to eat a subway sandwich while Stephen hawking is alive anymore :(
$C: This man belongs to stars. I'm not sure if he had any wishes where would his remains rest, but shooting his mortal remains into space would make him closer to his life work.
$C: Prof Hawking contracted amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 1963 at the age of 21.
$C: Wait so Hawking —and Eintstein both— died on pi day? 3.14‽ 
$C: Not something i expected to read today, dang man, i read that he was only supposed to live like to 20 with that ailment he had, and he made it all the way to 76. 
$C: He influenced my life greatly. 

I remember my brother getting one of his books and me reading it. I was in 5th grade. After reading the book I wanted more. I went to the library and loaned couple of his other books. Not trying to be /r/iamverysmart here, ofc I didn't understand that much of it but the consept of time and space always fascinated me. 

Rest in peace


$C: Somewhere out there in the universe you remain. You will be forever my inspiration. I never wanted you to go but I can say that I lived in the time of a genius, a man who saw life in a whole other perspective, who understood and respected the universe. You will be forever remembered as the brightest star of our times. 
$C: Bye Steven. I’ll see you mingling with the stars. X
$C: Hawkings: 
Born: January 8, 1942, Oxford, United Kingdom
Died: March 14, 2018, Cambridge, United Kingdom
Albert E : 
Born: March 14, 1879, Ulm, Germany
Died: April 18, 1955, Princeton, New Jersey, United States
$C: A legend who sits upon the scientific pantheon, possibly the 2nd-most well-known scientist of all time. A terrible loss but a life well lived. RIP
$C: Such a shame. He really was one of our greatest minds.

Rest in peace.
$C: This is awful. I fear it may be some time before we get another mind quite like Hawking’s. Is it a stretch to say he understood theoretical physics better than anyone else in world? 
$C: Press f to pay recpect
$C: How famous was Stephen?
$C: For some stupid reason I thought the guy was never going to die. Some people are just there you know. It's so weird that he's gone because even with his disease he seemed so untouchable.
$C: I remember seeing Stephen on the Simpsons. He was hilarious.
$C: The genius of our time.
$C: This is one of the most profound sadnesses I have ever felt. Losing the man I thought of while growing up as the smartest man on the planet, and possibly the most influential mind since Einstein, just leaves me feeling like as a species we just lost our compas. Sure there are other brilliant people out there, but when Stephen Hawking said something people listened. His enthusiasm for life and science and his method of making it accessible to the public while still leading his field was something truly remarkable that I fear we will never see again. 
$C: Soooo...he died on Pi day (3/14)?
$C: As a child nothing gave me more hope for my future than watching some of Stephen Hawking's documentaries. He gave me the ability to escape life and open my mind to the universe around us. As a child he inspired my love for math and science; giving me hope to understand the universe in the ways he did. One of my goals in life was to meet the man who lit the fire of scientific investigation of the universe within me. I'm truly upset to see such an amazingly inspirational man leave this world. RIP Stephen may you rest easy knowing your accomplishments and knowing we will pick up your unsolved problems. One day we will push past the barriers you could not yet with current science; it's just a shame you won't be there to see it.
$C: I would love for Pi Day to be henceforth celebrated as Hawking Day. The legacy he leaves is truly astronomical.
$C: Saddened to hear this however I think it’s important we all celebrate this person’s existence and contribution to the world. Rest easy.
$C: I dearly miss him! One of my heroes! R.I.P. 
$C: What did he actually achieve and what will he be remembered for?

Genuine question 
$C: What are we going to do without you? How can we top that? Leaving big huh Stephen? CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. 
$C: I really hope that no one will forget his stance towards humanity's potential self-destruction by destroying the environment even if he is already gone. He will be missed.
$C: He looks way way younger than 76
$C: The average IQ of humanity took a dive on this sad day.

Thank you for your contribution to science and knowledge, Mr. Stephen Hawking. Rest in Peace.
$C: Scrolling through the comments is so heartwarming. He left such a big imprint on the world
$C: I would love it if he got cremated and his ashes scattered or buried on mars when we finally get there
$C: Who is going to study about time travelling and parallel worlds now? I'm really sad about this
$C: Wow, I'm just so shocked. I honestly never really even considered the possibility of his death.
$C: RIP

I expect an in memoriam on Big Bang Theory and maybe Young Sheldon.
$C: Usually these posts about a "celebrity" that died don't really do much for me.

But I loved watching this man "talk" on national geographic. Actually really sad to see him go.
$C: Thanks for showing us what’s possible in even in the most dare of circumstances. You’ll always be an inspiration. 

;( 
$C: This is the man that bolstered my interest in maths and science, and I wouldn’t be where I am today without that influence. Thank you Mr. Hawking - may you rest in peace.
$C: Godspeed, good sir. May you now know all the mysteries of the universe.
$C: "Welcome. I am the pickled head of Stephen Hawking on a way cool rocket." - Stephen Hawking's Head
$C: "we are living in a world of widening, not diminishing, financial inequality, in which many people can see not just their standard of living, but their ability to earn a living at all, disappearing.

[...]

Now, more than at any time in our history, our species needs to work together. We face awesome environmental challenges: climate change, food production, overpopulation, the decimation of other species, epidemic disease, acidification of the oceans.

Together, they are a reminder that we are at the most dangerous moment in the development of humanity. We now have the technology to destroy the planet on which we live, but have not yet developed the ability to escape it. Perhaps in a few hundred years, we will have established human colonies amid the stars, but right now we only have one planet, and we need to work together to protect it."

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/01/stephen-hawking-dangerous-time-planet-inequality
$C: I was hoping that he'd get the Grand Unification Theory all figured out before this happened. 

R.I.P. Professor Hawking, you will be missed
$C: Can you recommend me any of his books? 
$C: The coolest thing about Stephen Hawking was that his response to any question is held in reverence with the utmost respect and attention. I just looked over at his AMA on AI, and am immediately impressed and inspired to contribute. There alone is his personal contribution to our society: inspiration of theoretical sciences (and academia in general, I suppose). 

I may be nobody, but I only wished he expounded upon his responses with greater insight on AI and in what forms we may expect it to generate and operate from. Regardless, his sentiment is the same grave warning that is perpetuated subliminally and directly by core, influential members of our society: AI is dangerous but wonderful; it invokes our imagination and curiosity. I think this is akin to the Biblical teaching of Adam and Eve taking/eating from the Tree of knowledge of good and evil. We have been warned through time about certain pursuits. 

I have not been blessed with the requisite knowledge to comment or speculate in detail. I only feel we should be careful and exercise our minds more or collaborating with other individuals rather than leaning so much on technology to answer our questions.
$C: "It wouldn't be much of a universe if it wasn't home to the people you love." 
$C: RIP Stephen Hawking. One of the great minds of science. 
$C: I know this comment will get buried, and rightfully so. I'm happy to see all of these comments celebrating his life. I would like to thank you, Professor Hawking, for inspiring us to care about Science. Thank you for your contributions to humanity. Thank you for being an inspiration. And most of all, thank you for putting up a fight. You won, and because you did humans will reap the rewards and study your discoveries for thousands of years to come. We won't let you down.
$C: The end of an era. RIP ...

press f to pay respect.
$C: That robot voice he used will stay famous. I wouldn't be surprised to see people re-creating dialogue with that voice for years to come. I have no idea what the voice is properly called but I'm sure it will be remembered as his. 
$C: Don't let the American voice box fool you, this was an English Legend. 
$C: Rest in peace, Stephen Hawking. You will no doubt be remembered for many years still
$C: This is the second time It has hurt me on death of someone who is not even remotely related to me.



Who Cares When One more Light Goes out.... Well I Do
$C: It hasn't fully hit me yet. Me little sister woke me up from a nap to tell me but I was so sleepy I didn't hear to well. I thought it was a bad dream. Later I saw it on Twitter and here and I can't fully believe it. It's seemed like he'd always be there, solving the mysteries of the universe. Now he's gone and it hasn't hit me fully yet. I know when it does tho I'm gonna be a mess. 
$C: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge."  RIP.
$C: It was an honor to have him live during our generation. 
$C: Hawking lived a long life, an especially long one for someone suffering from ALS.

I feel like making a big donation to the ALS Association.
$C: He will be forever be missed. Truly inspirational life. 
$C: He will forever be remember rip 
$C: "My goal is simple. It is a complete understanding of the universe, why it is as it is and why it exists at all." - SH

Should be the motto of every scientist. Probably my all time favourite quote.

Rest in peace, my hero.
$C: I remember watching many, many interviews of him in the past. His thoughts were brilliant and his humor was a beautiful mix of sarcasm and humbleness. May he Rest In Peace and I hope his story inspires those for centuries to come. 
$C: I hope now he gets the answers to all his questions. 
$C: With his loss, the average IQ of humanity has dropped a few points. 

Rest in Peace, Professor Hawking
$C: Fuck man, I just woke up and went to reddit to browse the news, then I saw this and I completely froze for a couple seconds. That doesn't happen to me often.
$C: Wow I don’t know what I was expecting but it almost still feels like too soon. 
$C: It is so amazing that he made it so long with this horrible disease, and was therefore able to share his vast knowledge with us. He was constantly learning and informing others, despite his diagnosis. May you rest in peace Professor Hawking, and thank you for all that you gave us. His knowledge was a gift that he gave to us, for longer than any thought possible. 

A nurse coworker of mine was diagnosed 4 years ago, and passed this week. She tried to work as long as she could, teaching, and sharing her knowledge as well, but she declined so quickly.  May she rest in peace as well. 
$C: On Einstein's birthday. At least somewhat fitting. RIP.
$C: Rest in peace you amazing scientist.
$C: I went to sleep to let Windows update, and the first thing I wake up to is this. Thought it was a bad dream. 

RIP 

$C: I actually jumped a little when I read the title. It never really occurred to me that such a great individual could die... he’s always just been a part of my life and what I would refer to as “smart” and “wise”. It never occurred to me that he was getting on in years, and that his condition might be speeding up the process even more. May he Rest In Peace. Gone but NEVER forgotten!
$C: Are there any scientists here in reddit who can genuinely say they became scientists inspired by Stephen Hawkings work? 
$C: I'm sure nobody cares, but this is how I'm going to pay my dues. 

I've been a Stargazer and dreamer since the day I could climb my backyard slide at night to get a *better view* of the stars from SUCH heights. They will always make me question what exactly existence is. 

What I find most uncanny about this beautiful creature, is that what he said all made sense to me. He made sense of my thoughts. He legitimized my silly failed-highschool-science. Until the end, he dared me to think outside the box - tools I have used to great success in my (non-scientific) career and life in general. And for this, I thank him on a personal level. 

Also, what a smartass. Legitimizes my smartassery, hopefully.

Cheers to the most intelligent creature that will ever likely grace this beautiful planet at the same time I will. Pour one for your dead homies <3
$C: If you scroll through your facebook newsfeed right now its like you're watching the second half of "The Theory of Everything".
$C: He inspired me with both his work and personality. RIP
$C: The Russians should pay for killing another brit!
$C: This is devastating news. When I was young I read his simplified/dumbed down explanation of how "our universe can be thought of as one expanding bubble in a room full of different bubbles that don't ever connect" changed my life and how I thought. Thank you Stephen for sharing your work with us. I am truly saddened  knowing he has passed.
$C: Hawking is not dead.  He's a time traveller. 
$C: Stephen Hawking inspired me to study physics and to pursue a PHD and a life of research. RIP. 
$C: Kind of always figured his death would coincide with our world going into "hell in a handbasket"...  Though I am very sorry to see him go, seems fitting, for the times.
$C: God gave a brilliant physicist (Albert Einstein) on this date and took away one, just to balance nature I guess?

PS - Same with Galileo and Newton.
$C: I hope that at least now people will listen to what he had to say about A.I.
I remember he once said that he wasn't afraid of dying, but he wasn't in a hurry to go because he had much he wanted to do. R.I.P. Professor Hawking.
$C: I’m deeply shocked and saddened. I should’ve expected this at some point but never thought about him dying. Never wanted to...

So Stephen...Whatever cosmic force brought you here? I hope it brings you to another far more deserving place. Where your brilliance can help shine some light on other dark corners of the universe. 

Rest In Peace you wonderful human.
$C: Truly a sad day. He was and is an incredible inspiration to the world. Humanity will be forever in his debt. 
$C: Saw his name trending on twitter and instantly knew he must have died. Was at a college party and announced the news and everyone was shocked. Goes to show that his name is known by many that may not even care for science. He’s the Einstein of our generation.
$C: As a scientist, he was one of the true rockstars, as almost every child in the world knows his name. He shared that status with Einstein and Newton. Rest in peace sir. He will be missed as, since him, very few scientists or even people for that matter have shared the same level of popularity and public adoration as him.
$C: I beg someone to show me this isn't true 
$C: Rest in peace you amazing human being 
$C: A sad day for all Humanity! Rest in Peace :(
$C: “Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet” - will do professor 👍🏻✨🔭 
$C: The one true superstar of our lifetime
$C: Shine on you brilliant diamond. 
$C: And today's Albert Einstein's birthday. What are the odds
$C: May your love for science one day shine through for generations to come in galaxies far away.
$C: The one thing that we can do now, is celebrate his life, instead of mourning his death. Which, in retrospect, is how all funerals should be.

Thank you for kicking ass in cosmology and astrophysics for over five decades when you were given only months to live.

And while you're up there, try to obtain the theory of everything. You have Einstein, Newton, Sagan, Feynman and the likes to help, after all.

Rest in peace legend.
$C: Bloody good run old boy.
*salutes in British*
$C: Though part of me is glad that he's now relieved from the pain of existence, the other part wishes that he should've lived long enough for his conscious to be uploaded into a perpetual medium; to find answers for his questions.
$C: I really am going to miss him...
$C: Goddammit. My wife and I just had a very important and tough conversation this early morning, emotions high and all. We settled down to get back to sleep, this news everywhere. 
$C: Shedding a tear for you buddy. RIP
$C: From his work on the origins of the Universe to the exchange of exotic particles on edge of black holes, Hawking’s contribution to cosmology and physics was huge. 
Even with a illness that doctors said would kill him in months, he managed to survive another 55 years, popularising the most complex physical concepts and making them accessible to people of all ages. He did all this with a depreciating sense of humour and enjoying life in spite of what it threw at him. When we think about the greatest scientific minds, he name deserves a mention amongst the panetheon of the greats. 

We lost a true legend today.
$C: If only the technology to transfer consciousness would've came sooner. The Einstein of my Generation. Farewell, until we meet again.
$C: Stephen Hawking is an inspiration and will remain to be for years to come. He is the definition of resilience and he will be missed. Thank you for everything Dr Hawking. 
$C: One of the greatest scientists ever to walk this Earth. Rest In Peace Stephen Hawking.
$C: One of a kind , an era has ended.
$C: Man I thought he was immortal rest well 
$C: another giant leaves us, he will be missed
$C: Rest in peace, giant of humanity!
$C: The world has lost its greatest mind today. He will be named alongside people like Einstein, Newton and Tesla in future generations and I'm glad to have lived during his time.
$C: An amazing man and an inspiration to anyone diagnosed with MND. 

R.I.P 
$C: May he continue to play poker with Einstein and Newton. Also, may I remind this sub that he was born in 1942? As in, his birth year had the answer to the Ultimate Question?
$C: May god bless his soul, another wise man dies
$C: Rest in peace, my hero. You gave so much to this world and I’m grateful for it. 
$C: A huge loss. Rest In Peace Stephen. 
$C: Thank You, Stephen Hawking.

We learnt a lot from you.

Say hello to Albert for us.

Rest in power. 
$C: One of the greatest minds ever to have lived,  Made complex science available to idiots like me... He will be missed it was an honour to have shared the same timeline with you
$C: We lost him on pi day :(( 
$C: Rest in piece mr Hawkins
$C: He might have past away, but he will live on as long as humanity does. Engraved in history alongside Einstein, Tesla and Newton, Hawking will be a name taught to every future generation. Through disproving god, he became ever excisting.
$C: May he rest in peace. Legendary man
$C: "Howerever difficult life may seem there is always something you can do and succeed at.lt matters that you don t just give up"
A man who fought his own fate and life yet emerged victorious ...A man who ,regardless of how "unable" life left him,showed everyone his superiority..A "weak" body led by one of the greatest minds ...Rest in peace Stephen Hawking you were ,not only one of the greatest minds earth has ever produced,but also one of its greatest and bravest fighters and survivors...
$C: Wish I could have met him. Amazing person and will definitely always look up to him and try to reach as close as I possibly can to his level, in hopes of being such an amazing influence. Thank you for everything Dr. Hawking and may you rest in peace.
$C: I found this man so facisnating.  I regarded him with awe just as much as Einstein.  What a tragedy for this man to be trapped in a prison but he had that brain to break free of his chains and see the world through his mind.  I hope he's free of that life and goes on thinking and existing outside his body and this tiny world.  Goodbye Stephen.  You will be missed in many ways.  /bows in reverence and respect. 
$C: Good night, sweet prince.
$C: Hawking's life will forever be added to the list of things to celebrate on this date including Albert Einsteins birthday and Pi.

He was a household name and one of the reasons I became a physicist, such a brilliant mind, RIP.
$C: Respect the men who contributed his whole life for modern science. Rest In Peace.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Stephen Hawking.. my idol since age 6.. rest well..
$C: Let us mourn to the fact that he is now gone and let us celebrate the fact that he didn't die in vain, he died knowing that his mind has helped revolutionize science as a whole and i hope we can all agree that he has been an inspiration to all of us. RIP

$C: This man inspired me through seven long years of struggle against my natural abilities to qualify in physics, and he continues to inspire me to understand more. I'll never come close to his genius, but I'm proud to say I'm a product of it. *What* a mark he made on this world. Good-bye, professor, I'll miss you. I think most of us will.
$C: He passed away on the most fitting day I think pi day I don't think there would've been any other day of the year which would've been more perfect
$C: Rest In Peace to a man who inspired many and will continue to do so for years to come
$C: Thanks a lot Vladimir... 
$C: Wow someone that was old died. Cool. Let move on. 
$C: Noooooooooooo! Come back!
$C: Such harrowing news... Like Einstein, Feynman, Tesla, and many more, his legacy will live on forever. Truly one of the greats. I will miss him dearly. I would have loved to have a conversation with him... Run some ideas by him, talk about life and the universe. Not that I thought I ever had a chance of doing that anyway, but now it’s absolutely impossible. His discoveries will continue pondering us for decades to come, and it’s sad he won’t be able to see how much the world will change because of his ideas... Goodbye, Stephen Hawking... I wish I’d known you personally.
$C: A great loss for the world. We need more people like him in this day and age of misinformation and populism. 

Grateful that I got to see him around a year ago.
$C: Wow such a lovely human being who has contributed so much to our society. I sure do hope he is at peace.

I am definitely going to re-watch my favourite documentaries of his as well as re-watch The Theory of Everything. I loved that movie.
$C: He was one of my heroes.
$C: As a physics student he really was such an inspiration. 

However, my favorite thing about him will forever and always be this: https://youtu.be/OH8s4N15zdg 
$C: "We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special."  -Stephen Hawking
$C: 54 years with ALS is not bad considering the average person who gets it passes after 5.
$C: I think that out of all the dates for him to pass on, the international Pi day makes his departure into the unknown energy fields that much more EPIC!
$C: I remember him saying he would go to orbit earth one day, and That everything was already set. Did he go?
$C: Nooooooooooo! That sucks.
$C: Thank you sir!  Your contributions to our community are appreciated.
$C: He was amazing scientist doing so much even with a disability.
$C: The man was an icon for beating the odds. The world will miss him greatly...

I always saw this day coming. Just not this soon....
$C: I feel sorry for those who don't know who the great Stephen Hawking is; they are missing out...

Rest in Peace, Mr Hawking...
$C: These are very sad news to wake up to.
He is one of the greatest minds of humanity, and his struggle with that disease was an inspiration to all of us.

My deepest condolences to his family and friends. The whole world is standing in respectful silence by their side. 
$C: The world has lost a brilliant mind. You'll be remembered!
$C: This dude was so rich why should we donate?
$C: Stephen"Rockstar" Scientist you will be dearly missed everytime they will talk about theoretical physics.
$C: RIP Brave warrior,you deserve this rest a lot
$C: Aweful news, rest well sir. 
$C: Only At 76 Too! We Could’ve Learned So Much More If This Man Had Lived.. I’m disappointed, He Was An Intelligent, Tremendous, And Most Motivational Role Model. Ain’t No One Like Him. I Salute And Have  High Respect For Stephen Hawkings. May He R.I.P Thank You For Your Research.
$C: He introduced me to the wonders of cosmology, and fascinated me with his idea for a unified cosmic theory. Today is a sad day :(
$C: Rest in peace Stephen the world won't forget you.
$C: Legend. Press F to pay Respect.
$C: Stephen Hawking has left an unfathomable "BLACK HOLE" in the field of science. 
$C: I feel bad for his family, but now he and they can finally get some well deserved rest. R.I.P.
$C: Goodbye Mr Hawking you will be missed, a hero, legend an inspiration that conquered physically and most definitely mentally. Your intellect and commitment on figuring out the unfathomable will boost future generations forever. You will never be forgotten. We will remember your warnings. RIP the smartest man on earth.
$C: His shows and books inspired me as a teenager to pursue science. RIP man
$C: If you haven't seen the movie about him, "The Theory of Everything", its very good. 
$C: Rest in Space Stephen.
$C: RIP. The world is already worse off without you.
$C: This hurts my heart beyond belief!
$C: I'm not crying, you're crying. :'(
$C: Every time I’m outside at night walking the dog, I always look up and gaze at the stars... thanks to you my friend.  Rest In Peace!  
$C: Whenever I think of the word "Science" he's often the first person that comes to mind. It is shocking to hear he has passed.
$C: Incredibly sad to hear. When my nephew became paralyzed I often thought about Stephen Hawkins incredible life. I would often tell my nephew that he could still "do anything". RIP.
$C: He has done much for humanity. Rest in peace.
$C: Rest in peace. I'm not very good at wording my emotions, all I know is we will all miss him. There needs to be an international holiday to remember Stephen Hawking, he has contributed so much to science and the world in general.
$C: I pray for his family and friends during this time.  

May God bless and comfort them.
$C: Rest in peace. I remember buying your book "A Brief History of Time" when I was 17. It really inspired me and I always thought it was amazing how despite your terrible disease It never stopped you from being one of the greatest minds to have ever existed. 


I hope Cambridge names a college after you. 
$C: No.

That upsets me more than you realized

I knew George Carlin would die someday 
$C: May you run ably forever in Heaven, Dr. Hawking! God's masterpiece.
$C: Well there are 99 another universes where he's alive, so no need to be upset.
$C: Such sad news to hear. Although, to be honest, the fact that he lived to the age of 76 with what he had was astounding.
$C: Other famous people have passed and I haven't cared much.  I was bummed when we lost George Carlin, I was bummed when we lost Robin Williams, but this....this hurts.
$C: He is the man who made me appreciate and idolize the scientists I used to ignore in school before such as Isaac Newton, Galileo Galilei, Einstein and even Aristotle. He inspired me to love science. Such a great man. His death really caught me off guard.
$C: Much Respect from the Muslims around the world. 

http://www.radioislam.org.za/a/index.php/latest-news/23206-stephen-hawking-deep-respect-for-palestinian-struggle.html
$C: On the Shoulder's of Giants he conducted his work, and what a Mountain he became. 

Thank you Stephen for the advancement of our entire planet thanks to the brilliance of your mind. 

May we take the torch passed and continue the pursuit of knowledge and greatness. 

Fuck what a sad day. 
$C: Damn. One of the most extraordinary minds and a truly inspiring human. Rest In Peace.
$C: Rip to the man who changes the lives of many
$C: He was truely a man that defied odds.  To think that a person with such a severe disability outclassed perhaps every other living person in the planet with his brilliance is astounding, inspirational and eye opening.  He truely proved that anything is possible, and he left his mark on humanity forever.
$C: He was one of the few scientists who was both a pioneer in his field and a great popularizer of science to the layman, inspiring generations of aspiring young scientists. He will be missed dearly.
$C: We lost one more Diamond from The Earth.Rest in peace ,Sir
$C: Why he never won the Nobel Prize?
$C: Yikes... the world just became noticeably dumber
$C: As someone who has been obsessed with STEM since as far as I can remember, a loss of a great man has been felt today. One of the greatest modern luminaries of our time, a personal hero, someone who, no doubt helped cultivate my interest in the STEM since an early age, has passed on. A devotion to STEM is one of the greatest sacrifices, a field where the hard work of men and women, helps solve problems that plague our modern world, and physics just lost one of it's champions. RIP one of my inspirations, you truly changed the heart of many. RIP Stephen Hawking, the man who appreciated the grand design of the universe
$C: "Remember to look up at the stars"
Rip to science's brightest star

$C: You wake up one morning and check reddit on your phone, you go back to sleep thinking it's just one of those dreams.

You wake up again later on and then realise it actually happened. 

Devastating. 
$C: 14th of March, birthday of Einstein and the anniversary of Hawkings death... 

I am sad.
$C: The theory of everything is such a deep movie

$C: It is very sad that it had to be now. I'm sure this great man had much more to offer the world in terms of inspiration and scientific knowledge. Personally I loved his philosophy and will remember him always. RIP and may you know that you have brought so much good in this world for many.
$C: It's the first time that I cry for the death of a person that I never talked to. Rest in peace, Stephen.
$C: godspeed Stephen.  i carried you around with me for the last 30 years.
$C: What a huge loss to the world of science and the world in general. R.I.P. Mr Hawking.
$C: I am unhappy, i am sad. Strength for your loved ones. RIP and love from an advanced breed of monkeyman. 
$C: I was watching VRV yesterday and a commercial popped up for his curiosity stream. My mind wondered and I thought of his AMA, and what he meant to the world. Everybody talked of his intellect,  I'd love to know more about his emotions. Weird that I wake to this, this morning. 
$C: RIP Professor Hawking.
$C: Man, this is... weird. I’m not really a very empathetic person in general (except to animals and fictional characters, idk), and generally when celebrities die, no matter how familiar or fond of them I am, I don’t really feel anything. I can appreciate why other people found it sad that they had died, but I never really felt anything myself, not for Michael Jackson, Robin Williams, Alan Rickman, John Hurt... 

But this time it’s different. I think it’s just kind of bittersweet because I had never really properly appreciated him or his genius until recently. I always just had this part of me that rejected the idea that anyone could surpass Einstein (I seemingly had a fixation with him as a child for reasons unknown). But recently I finally started ‘A Brief History of Time’, and it suddenly became clear to me why he is so important and an inspiration to so many. 

I just wish I had come to appreciate him sooner while he was still alive. I know in reality it would have changed little, but the thought that maybe I could have watched and appreciated his live lectures, or followed more closely the discoveries he seeks in ABHoT as the world of theoretical physics has advanced since his own major discoveries... 

Well, if nothing else, I have a renewed vigour to push on with his writings and try to understand more and more the work he devoted his life to.

RIP.
$C: I think it's fitting that he passed on Pi Day
$C: One of the All-Time Greats. RIP
$C: 'A brief history of time' - i was just 12 when I read it for the first time and was fascinated by it. He really made 'astro-physics stuff' interesting and easy to understand for commoners. Thank you Mr Hawking.
$C: Seeing 5 trending threads all about Dr. Hawking makes me sad to lose our professor and hopeful for our generation. 
$C: Im not ready for this. 
$C: Wait, Hawking died on pi day
$C: How was he found? I sort of want to know.
$C: The world lost an icon. I hope he can rest easy among the stars. 
$C: As a local in Cambridge, I had grown accustomed to seeing Stephen Hawking around the city, almost annually. The last time I saw him was early last year, with his family, and it was a touchingly human scene of a surprisingly elderly man (considering he is more often a celebrity icon of quantum physics) surrounded by a much loving family. I had always looked forward to seeing him at least once more, but instead I shall remember him as I saw him last. An incredible mind who defied the odds and brought the marvels of our universe and human compassion together in a way that has greatly inspired us all. R.I.P Steve, you'll be sorely missed. 
$C: RIP. Throughout my whole life he has been somebody to look up to as an example of how you truly can do anything if you put your mind to it. Trapped in a degenerating body he was still arguably the smartest person in the world, and has contributed so much to our understanding of science. Honestly I'll give him credit for my love of science too. He will be missed

$C: Thank You for leading mankind towards the stars. Rest In Peace.
$C: We were lucky to live in the time where we could understand and provide the tools for him to live long and express his ideas, and he used those and he was brave and kicked ass and did so much more. I'm not a scientist by profession but if things have turned out differently I would have been because of minds like him.
$C: Truly one of the greatest minds of our age. 
$C: You what's crazy to think is that if he were born in an earlier age without the technology to communicate and move around we would have never really known about his mind. Makes me wonder how many minds were lost because of the lack of equipment for them to use.
$C: A sad day. Lets hope for humanity somewhere someone can continue his work. 
$C: The world needs more people like him, an inspiration for so many. Rest in peace Mr Hawking.
$C: 'Time for this hog to fly'
$C: I have never been very sad about celebrity deaths but this got me. A brilliant mind gone from this earth, enjoy the infinite cosmos
$C: He'll live on as a pioneer and inspiration to many.
$C: RIP. you changed my life back in those years. thank you for being.
$C: Godspeed, Stephen and thanks for all your contributions to the field of astrophysics
$C: Farewell to one of our finest ever.
$C: Rip to one of the brightest minds that ever lived.
$C: And just like that the world has lost one of its greatest minds, thankful we had him for as long as we did however. I posit he exists in eternity as “star stuff” as Carl Sagan would say, not too shabby.
$C: R.I.P. Stephen Hawking, you'll always be remembered.
$C: This man showed us no matter what your struggles but if we are motivated and determined nothing can stop us! Respect and RIP
$C: This is such sad news to wake up to. We lost a fascinating human being.
$C: Thanks for being the presence you were, Stephen. Every moment you thought you wouldn't have was a gift to all of us. 
$C: I hope the theory of all would be discovered in nearest future. Dr. Hawking have done a lot for it!
$C: Sad day for all humanity. He was a once in a multi generational mind. 
$C: I recommend everyone watch the 3 part series of "into the universe". It captures his unique personality, whit and intellect, that is truly spellbinding 
$C: Damnit, we need all the smart people we can get. He was a voice of reason and will be missed.
$C: He will be dearly missed. Amazing contributer to science. RIP 
$C: Nothing in life will call upon us to be more courageous than facing the fact that it ends. But on the other side of heartbreak is wisdom.
$C: Man, what a fucking guy. Imagine doing all the things he did while going through all the stuff he did. What a genius.
$C: Finally he gets to rest in a black hole
$C: When I hear of the death of a famous person I normally don’t feel anything.

I’m genuinely sad right now. 
$C: Maybe his body just couldn't handle his genius mind. I hope his freedom will now let him go further into beyond.
$C: I can not believe it. He was a brilliant man! Strong and smart enough to beat the odds, also. I am sad to see him go. May Stephen Hawking rest in peace! 
$C: https://www.reddit.com/r/nostupidquestions/comments/8456sz

This post might have jinxed it
$C: Well, time to give "A Brief History of Time" a third or fourth go. I'll concentrate real hard this time in his honor.
$C: rip
the world will miss him

does anyone know what really big things he did for the world?
i dont know much about his work
$C: first year physics student here, to say the man was an inspiration to me is an understatement, his work is one of the contributing factors to why I'm even where I am today. I also was born and grew up in Cambridge, I've spent my entire childhood living in the same area as one of the greatest minds the world has seen, so there's something a little odd, about knowing when I go back home from university in a week or so, my hero will not be there.

Rest well, and just know that we're going to carry your work on, and if you may never be the one to answer the questions about the universe, your work will be the foundation for the next generation of physicists.
$C: A huge blow to the world. Brilliant man, scientist, author, friend, icon is gone. He has inspired countless amounts of people to take up science to better the world and themselves.

RIP Mr. Hawking, it was a pleasure to learn from you.
$C: Man...  We hear stories of epic historical minds like Socrates or Archimedes or Ibn Khaldun... Stephen Hawkings was one of those minds, but living in our time.
$C: Live long and prosper 
$C: A personal inspiration of mine and a true inspiration to all. A man who was both a physical manifestation of determination and a visionary scientist.
$C: Will always remember how he made astronomy so interesting with his "into the universe with Stephen Hawking". RIP Hawking, you will be missed!
$C: This sucks. This really really sucks. RIP Stephen. 
$C: How was he able to live for so long? Most als   patients go much quicker
$C: Godspeed good sir, may the grand design be revealed to you in all its glory. 
$C: He once said: ‘It would not be much of a universe if it wasn’t home to the people you love.’ We will miss him for ever.” #TBT
$C: Mr. Hawking did so much for the scientific world - teaching young and old people about its wonders, inspiring young children like me to join in the world of science. While his lifelong work was, unfortunately, unfinished, that's where we come in. It's our job to carry on the legacy of his research now, and fulfill what he ultimately couldn't in his life - a true theory of everything for the universe. Godspeed, Mr Hawking, and may you peacefully return to the universe that you loved so much.
$C: Rest easy Mr.Hawkings
$C: Now I want to rewatch the theory of everything again. 

RIP. Smartest man of the past few generations. 
$C: RIP, a miracle that he lived this lived this long. 


He fueled my passion for physics, and now that he passed it is only placing that passion into overdrive. 


The world mourns his loss and may he get whatever afterlife he wished.

Something I took from r/eve I find pertaining here.



Eyes forward, capsuleer, the cyno is not yet lit. 

Consider your modules, your rigs and ammo before you undock. 
For the cyno is not yet lit. 

Break free of the station and witness the universe before you. 
For the cyno is not yet lit. 

Set your ship to fly through the vastness while you wait. 
For the cyno is not yet lit. 

Pay attention, capsuleer, for those who have gone before you call for you to join them. 

The cyno is now lit.

o7 


May his family and friends cope well. 
$C: Uhm... did he really die on pi day? What a fitting day. 
$C: We all knew he didn’t have much longer, but goddammit this still caught me off guard.
$C: RIP Stephen and thank you. o7
$C: Wow this is tragic news. RIP Stephen.
$C: Feels like I lost someone I knew... 
$C: Why, why did I get on Reddit today
$C: And he died on πday, god bless his soul!
$C: On Pi day of all days
$C: Well I think true tribute would be people talk of his theories so that Snapchat generation will get some knowledge and spare some time from making puppy face...
$C: All I can think of is his little computer asking if it did a good job, was Master Hawking pleased :( and him letting it know it did the BEST job.. RIP Mr. Hawking....
$C: I opened reddit this morning and I saw two gifs of Stephen Hawking in a row and I was like NOOOOO😭
$C: Nothing against the guy, but I certainly won’t miss the media’s cherry-picked quotes about AI, the future, atheism, and humanity in general.

I’m sure Hawking wasn’t a downright pessimist,  it he certainly wasn’t a genius philosopher. His genius was math, otherwise he was just another intelligent human with an outlook imposed on him by a condition he had no control over. I don’t begrudge his ideas, they’re reasonable to have and definitely well thought out.

But the part I hated was how the media would treat him like some kind of genius prophet, and “science enthusiasts” would take everything he said as Gospel truth simply because it came from him. What’s worst, it was usually an off-the-cuff answer to a probing question when Hawking himself wanted to talk about other things.

So, R.I.P. Stephen. A genius, but also a man.
$C: Absolutely shocked... I've always wanted to become a physicist and meet this guy, he is my inspiration and I feel lost now... no matter what disease he had or what conditions  he suffered from, I still find it unreal that he is gone. This guy and Edward Witten are probably the greatest physicists of our generation. Although this amazing man is dead, he will always live on in the history and essence of physics. Life always ends and death takes us all. Rest in peace, you've earned to sleep peacefully after all these amazing battles you've fought. 
$C: on pi day... Hmm... If he could have wished for a day to pass on, this might have made the list. Godspeed, Mr.Hawking...
$C: We'll remember you Stephen Hawking
$C: Oh my goodness, this news has really hit me hard. What a loss for the world...
$C: He will forever be remembered. Thanks Steven. Rest in peace.
$C: Rest in peace Doctor Hawking... may you find a joy and release in the hereafter that the limitations of your body in this world could never provide...
$C: Feels like there’s now one less constant by which we can solve the ultimate equation, but perhaps one more variable.
$C: To think I just read his book a few short months ago. May his legacy inspire future scientists for generations to come.
$C: That's a big loss for humanity 
$C: This is the first time I cried when a celebrity died...
$C: I don't know why this death is hitting me hard. Huh...
$C: Wait, w,what? No, this cant happen
$C: rip we still needed him but i hope we dont let him down
$C: Today is a sad day, but will not let drag me down for I wish to celebrate his life. He never stopped learning so neither will I. It is always my goal to learn something about science every day . He also did not let his disability get in the way of living his life. Being a disabled veteran I try to live by his example. Mr. Hawking you will be sorely missed on this day.
$C: I hope his passing was painless
$C: Man, think what he could've done if he was healthy when he did this much as a cripple.
$C: He ended up living a fairly long life but no matter what age he died it would always be too soon. I wonder what humanity could have gained had he lived longer. RIP you brilliant man. 
$C: Actually galaxy brain
$C: I’m glad he was able to live for so very long with his condition. He truly lived his life despite his disability; he contributed more to the world than most of us likely will, and even had a family as well, and managed to live to old age. What a great man.
$C: Rip it was an honor sharing this giant rock we call earth with such a beautiful mind and soul 
$C: the lake comparison is really a good hint, thanks.
$C: I read only the other day that he believed himself to be on track for a Nobel Prize in his lifetime, apparently having finally gathered sufficient evidence to prove Hawking Radiation. What a shame it wasn’t peer reviewed in time. Hopefully someone will build upon his work and finally claim that prize for his theory. And I do believe a posthumous knighthood would be highly applicable in this instance 
$C: RIP. may humanity  remember  you
$C: Probably will be the most significant death of all our lives. Very first thing I saw when I woke up so not really sure what to say. Most major deaths mean nothing to me. But this man was about as far from "nothing" as one can be.
$C: I hope he finally has all the answers to his questions.  RIP Steven.
$C: RIP. The world lost a brilliant mind.
$C: The world feels a little colder this morning. I remember my father reading "A Brief History of Time" when I was a child. That was my introduction to this great man, and because of him, I fell in love with science and astronomy.

A life well lived. That energy cannot be destroyed. 
$C: Isn't it crazy how for at least a large part of the world he died on Pi Day
$C: The best of the best in the online video gaming community.
$C: I thought he was dead for a couple years now tbh
$C: And on Pi day too. But do other countries celebrate Pi day on 31/4 instead of 3/14?
$C: And he died on Pi Day:(
$C: All of my these amazing people dying in our generation is saddening and horrible.. to think that people like Danielle Bregoli are gonna replace them. 
$C: RIP - hopefully his information is never lost
$C: Woke up to the news,10 minuets later had to get a dry shirt on. 
$C: I leave my mark here. He was something special, I wonder if we’ll see something like him again in our lifetime.
$C: I want to play lockstep







Also rip Steven hawking. Now he’ll never continue working on his theories
$C: On Albert Einstein's birthday, no less.
$C: Godspeed Stephen. You revolutionised the universe
$C: Huge loss for the planet/human race. RIP Mr. Hawking!
$C: I always thought I would die before he would RIP
$C: I saw a pic in r/funny with him and Jim Carey that said RIP but I just thought it was because Jim Carey was "killing" him with laughter. Then I saw this post :(. RIP to a legend. 
$C: Anyone else think it's just a little peculiar that he passed away on Pi day?  3.14 RIP
$C: It's incredible how long he lived even with his medical condition.
$C: Hinc lucem et pocula sacra.

Farewell Professor Hawking, we can all only hope to be a fraction of the person you were.
$C: Great guy with a great sense of humour!
$C: Oh, man that really shocked me, amazing man and an inspiration.
$C: He was one of though people I never really thought of dying.
$C: Thank you sir, for dedicating your mind to the pursuits which you've so eloquently navigated.

Rest easy, bright star.
$C: I'd like to think someone preserved some of his genetic material in secret and then in 200 years they'll regenerate him whole to pick up where he left off.
$C: RIP. One of the most insightful physicists ever. He will be missed.
$C: And on Pi day of all saya
$C: I hope he died with no regrets. Rest In Peace.
$C: Wow, he was *THE* symbol of science, an icon but excuse my ignorance, why didn't he get knighted? As in Sir Stephen Hawking? Anyway rest in peace
$C: Can anyone explain to me how he died? Is it because of the neurone disease or something else
$C: No way. He's definitely an idol. Will missed. I hope someone smart enough can continue his legacy on black holes and information theories. R. I. P. 
$C: I hope he is at the best strip joint in the after life.
$C: This makes me incredibly sad. We are witnessing a historic moment. He was truly the definition of inspiring. I wish him peace and same to his family. His legacy will continue to lead the scientific community and the generation he inspired to join that community with live on.
$C: Rest in peace Stephen Hawking.
$C: RIP to one of the brilliant men who made me love science.
$C: RIP.  14 March.  Pi day.  
$C: He was a true inspiration for me. A brilliant physicist and person. His dedication and ferocious ambition to chase what he loved despite all odds was honestly the most extraordinary thing I have ever seen in anyone that I have had the pleasure to live among. He will be remembered as a legend and one of the greats on whom's shoulders we will stand on. Rest in Peace Stephen. 
$C: Tasteful or not, shall we take a stroll through Miles Mathis paper on [Stephen Hawking](https://rielpolitik.com/2015/04/26/stephen-hawking-died-and-has-been-replaced-by-miles-mathis/)?


$C: Your body failed you but that didn’t stop you. You are an inspiration to those that reach for an understanding of the very nature of all that is around us. Rest in peace.
$C: He died on Pi day. This should cement March 14th as a world wide holiday.
$C: On pi day... ?! It's a conspiracy. The wheelchair did it.
$C: Including this article this is the 3rd different age I've heard that he's died at all morning 74, 75 and 76 one of these numbers have to be right and one or more wrong! RIP Stephen Hawkins, we'll get it right eventually! :)
$C: Rest in peace, great one. I hope you find peace in the very cosmos that you once sought the meaning of.
$C: The world will surely miss him. I know I will.


Edit: I thought he did this morning which would have been pi day.
$C: I was very sad to hear from my brother this morning that Stephen Hawking had died.  This man inspired my life-long wonder in physics, the universe, and science in general.  It was this wonder that carried me through many points in my life and still makes me stand in awe at the reality around us.  Thank you and rest in peace.
$C: Was War Games Prof. Stephen Falken an homage to Professor Stephen Hawking? Rest In Peace Professor Hawking. We’ve lost an astonishingly brilliant mind. 
$C: Very sad news, amazing mind, brilliant man.  RIP.
$C: This is tragic, but of all the days to go, pi day is pretty dope as a physicist
$C: If heaven exists, it's just getting cooler and cooler. Rest in peace, I only hope I can  bring a fraction of goodness that Stephen brought into the world.
$C: He made physics and cosmology seem accessible and more interesting.  I am grateful for his work. 
$C: Everyone eat pi(e) in his honor today.
$C: pi day

same day as Einstein's birthday

Einstein also died at 76

$C: We are all stardust. -Carl Sagan.  Thank you Stephen for all your contributions to the field.
$C: I can't believe that he died. He was such an amazing man, living far past his life expectancy, but more importantly because he significantly advanced science.

Rest in peace, Stephen Hawking. You will never be forgotten.
$C: One of the greatest minds of our generation and he dies on Einsteins birthday really sad news to wake up to.
$C: 17 years ago i had to do a science project book report.  I was completely ignorant of any and everything to do with science.  I asked the teacher for a book suggestion.  The teacher reached over to the corner of his desk and handed me "A Brief History of Time."  My worldview has never been the same since.  Reading that book was the catalyst that changed my ENTIRE LIFE in all the most glorious ways that science inspires.  I thank Stephen Hawking for showing me the real world and waking me up to reality.
$C: Can someone tell me *how* he changed the world? It's the first thing people say but they never know how, just that he was a physicist. I'm very curious, I loved the film about his life and feel he really showed that sick or not: you can get there. But I'd really like to know what het put down on paper that made people think "Now things are different than this morning".
$C: DAE think he's actually having his brain preserved, but doesn't want the world to fret?
$C: I saw this coming for some reason
$C: Farewell, was very unpleasant to read last night. 
$C: Where should i start reading his books?
$C: Damn. He will be missed.
$C: A truly exceptional mind and a wonderful person. Rest in peace.
$C: RIP to a hero of mine. 

He fought so many odds and became a figurehead that anything is possible. 

RIP Hawking...and a sad happy Pi day to everyone 
$C: I am honestly stunned. What were his last words?

RIP anyhow.
$C: I'm sorry you never made it to space, man. :'( I hope someone goes out of their way to get you there now though.
$C: This is gonna put me into depression again...
$C: When I woke up and read this news I thought it's either a joke or I'm still sleeping. That's one of deaths that you know will happen but just hope that never will. I'm so sad now, Professor Hawking was one of the scientists that got me interested in astronomy and physics. 😢
$C: He will be truly missed. Such an inspiring figure that will be remembered for years to come.
$C: Let this incredibly intelligent and accomplished dude be a reminder that society needs to look after people with disabilities and enable them to achieve their potential instead of just 'parking' them.
$C: His writing got me through some seriously rough times. I will miss him. What an incredible person.
$C: I'm not a physicist. I'm not a scientist. Hell, I'm not part of the STEM community, but absolutely everyone can agree that we've lost a true champion today.
$C: Thank you Mr Hawking, but you will be missed
$C: Rest in peace Stephen.
$C: Where can I learn about some of his major contributions?
$C: Who would you put at the top of your news site today? The death of the brightest mind on earth or the death of some 62 year old woman who once starred in a movie with Elvis?
https://i.redd.it/i86hrr4xhql01.png
$C: He passed away on PI day, Einstiens birthday.  Rest in Peace sir.
$C: This man was one of the brilliant minds who inspired my love of science growing up. It was such an honor and privilege to live in both the same universe and time as him. He will be dearly missed.
$C: Time to break out Brief History once again, just to be embarrassed at how little i understand about a book that's meant to be so understandable.
$C: RIP Stephen, Rest in  parallel universe for longer!
$C: What exactly is there to discuss? 
$C: Rest in peace sir. Thoughts go out to his family.
$C: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO damn it!
$C: "One need not loose hope"
Thank you for everything you will be dearly missed! 

$C: Stephen Hawking died on March 14th, Albert Einstein’s birthday.
$C: Please forgive me if I’m putting this in the wrong place .

Rest In Peace you amazing man. When I was young I hated going to school because of what a hard time I had in it but when my mum got me George’s secret key to the universe it made me love science and space and all there is to be discovered you made science and learning fun for me and helped me when I thought nothing else would as a kid thank you so much sir may you Rest In Peace. 
(sorry for the bad English)

$C: I had a tear in the corner of my left eye while reading the article. He is truly inspirational! 
$C: He was the kind of mind who arrive only once or twice in a century - our generation's Einstein. I wonder who the next one will be...
$C: He reached average life expectancy of a healthy human

$C: I know this sounds weird but when I was 11 my family moved to another state and A Brief History in Time is what got me through that. I read the book over and over trying to understand it, which at the time I never really did, and the impact of moving away from friends and family didn't really affect me. Needless to say like most people I looked up to the man, sad day
$C: Woah, I did not expect this. I’m deeply saddened. 
$C: When I read this article title out loud to my girlfriend she gasped thinking professor X from X-Men had died. “He was in a chair”  Idk if she meant sir Patrick Stewart himself or Charles Xavier either way I get to inform her on who this man is now ;) 
$C: A genius and a tremendous man. He inspired me as he did countless others, and contributed immeasurably to the world in so many ways. I only regret that he died before learning the anwers to so many of the great mysteries of the Universe. What a guy, RIP Stephen Hawking.
$C: [removed]
$C: Cheers to a beautiful man. This drink is for you Stephen Hawking. 
$C: This may sound weird but A Brief History of Time had such a big impact on me even though I'm not an academic or have any kind of science background. Hawking's ability to so effortlessly, brilliantly relate such difficult material in such a meaningful way has always impressed me and that book was/is, in my opinion, one of the greatest ways to gain some life perspective when you're going through some confusing times or personal questioning. In a lot of small ways, A Brief History of Time has changed my life by allowing me to reassess myself, my issues, my thoughts, and my worldview from a very genuine, impactful standpoint. That may never have been Hawking's intention but the value of that book extends so far beyond just science.
$C: I'm sorry that he passed. 

“The Lord giveth and
the Lord taketh away"

$C: Stephen Hawking's death is a loss to the world
$C: If they keep Stephen Hawking's computer, does that mean they could use his voice to give his own eulogy?
$C: Man was, is, inspiring.  

Is there a movie based on his life, documentary or cameos people like? 
  
I hear in addition to being astounding intellectual, he was also a funny person when you got to know him, a mischevious prankster with his friends. 
$C: What a day, he will be remembered forever #rip
$C: Wow man, weird. I didn’t think I’d be this surprised by a famous scientist dying but I guess I’m so used to saying “who cares/tone it down” when a celebrity who doesn’t contribute to intellectual culture dies that when someone who does important work dies it’s like I’m desensitized 
$C: What an amazing person. He will be truly missed by all especially in the scientific community. I hope everyone strives to better the human race as a whole like he did; It’s people like him that inspired me to study Engineering and try to do good in the world. I hope one day I can come anywhere near him in terms of bettering the human race as a whole.

May his final journey into the cosmos be a peaceful one.
$C: RIP! Sad day. He was such an inspirational person in all aspects of his life. 
$C: Stephen Hawking, the rolemodel for science and intellectual fields for decades, passed away today. This is a great loss for human civilization, but I hope his wish of an interstellar human civilization will come true and that he'll rest in deserved peace. A miracle in human form.
$C: His legacy will live on forever.
$C: The death of Stephen Hawking has left a black hole in the science community. RIP to a great man, and an inspiration to many young scientists and mathematicians.
$C: "However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. Where there's life, there's hope." 

To one of the most iconic minds, thank you for proving that no matter what, you still need to grind and move forward. The human who had only 2 years left to live in 1962, said goodbye in 2018. 
$C: See you in another timeline 🤘 old friend 
$C: I don't have anything profound to say, just commenting to pay my respects. 
$C: I always looked up to him. So sad.
$C: Stephen was in my opinion, one of the best and most world changing scientists to ever live
$C: As I heard this I was sad as he inspired me to do physics
$C: I knew it was coming but i still cried for hours.
$C: It truly is a tragedy (and kinda impressive in a way given how ridiculously long he lived with ALS)
$C: Luckily, we had more than a brief life of Dr. Hawking. Rest in peace. 
$C: This might come across as stupid questions but -

1. Was he ever in consideration for a Nobel? E.g for Hawking radiation.
2. why was he not given a knighthood?
$C: I read *The Universe in a Nutshell* before I was old enough to even understand it properly.

RIP, Stephen. You will be missed.
$C: Now he knows all. He can visit a black hole and look inside. He can pause and rewind the Big Bang. He can touch the edge of the Universe...
$C: Haha! His was a way better anecdote. This was the only one I had!
$C: Sigh.. gonna missed him. The Einstein of our time
$C: May he rest in peace. 

Amazing & great.
$C: Thank you for showing me that Physics was my passion when I feel lost in my life. You'll always be remembered Stephen, wherever Galaxy you're in now. 
$C: someone forgot to put him on charge
$C: The overall IQ of the earth population just went down.
$C: I'm more sad than I expected to be. 
$C: I saw that he died on a news site and my first reaction was: no way that he died. 
$C: I am heartbroken. This is the most influential physicist since Einstein. Reminds me of Sagan's death. My grandmother and one of my role models in the same year, wow. Hawking and Neil Tyson made me fall in love with astronomy and study it. Prayers for his family.
$C: Elon should make a special tesla roadster with hawking body in it then send them into deep space.  RIP Professor.
$C: Hearing about his passing hurts. 
$C: Ffffffuuuuucccckkkkk nnnnooooooi I don't want him to be dead!!!
$C: Didn’t even live to see the first black hole picture this year! ;.....(
$C: One of the very few scientists who achieved so much in science and enlightened so many people beyond science.
$C: The blow to the national average IQ of the UK is immense. 
$C: RIP.
Such a brilliant mind.

$C: All I can say is, Good Job man. Way to make the most of it. 
$C:  When I was in middle school I broke my ankle and has to stay home for a week. During this week I watched Stephen Hawkings into the universe. After that I decided to become a physicist. 8 years later and I am a sophomore physics major. It never occured to me that he might die, but now that he has I realize how great a mind we lost. 


$C: we shouldn't mourn Hawking's death. We should be celebrating. He's in a better place. We should also be celebrating Einstein's birthday.
$C: Lightspeed good professor.
$C: what is dead may never die

$C: Its a real shame to see such a bright mind go. But he and all of us know that his name and contributions to science will never be forgotten. 

He will be the Einstein of our time. Our understanding of the universe would be only a fraction of what it would be now if he never came along. And the fact he accomplished so much with a horrible disease and lived a long life against all odds is humbling.

May he rest in peace. And I hope someone can carry his legacy.
$C: We have done a free download of a commemorative map of the sky as it was when he was born, our small tribute:

https://greaterskies.com/stephen-hawking-star-map/
$C: Why did god take him and leave us with gallowboob
$C: Stephen Hawking died on my 30th Birthday. Life is strange it really is, he was an amazing human being. 
$C: He had such a bright smile
$C: "Our eyes are yet to open" Master Hawking. RIP
$C: I really hope the Brits give him a national state funeral, sounds crazy I know but I feel like he such a monumental figure in modern British history
$C: Can someone confirm or deny the BBC assertion, seen on BBC news channel chirons this evening that his contribution was to string theory.  

I had thought his contributions were far more related to GR, so where did the BBC get the idea his contribution was to string theory?


$C: When I first saw the news this morning, I was in shock.  I have never had a celebrity death hit me like this.  As I went on about my day, I remembered an article I read after my own mother died in 2008.  I just thought I would put the quotes here.  

It is from a talk on NPR by Aaron Freeman:

"And you'll want the physicist to explain to those who loved you that they need not have faith; indeed, they should not have faith. Let them know that they can measure, that scientists have measured precisely the conservation of energy and found it accurate, verifiable and consistent across space and time. You can hope your family will examine the evidence and satisfy themselves that the science is sound and that they'll be comforted to know your energy's still around. According to the law of the conservation of energy, not a bit of you is gone; you're just less orderly."
$C: He will certainly be remembered. He was the most prominent physicist of my time, and served as an inspiration to many trying to achieve success in the face of personal struggle.
$C: Im just here for history
$C: I can’t help but think man did more than I may ever hope to accomplish but without self pitty. 
$C: He never got the Nobel, because Hawking radiation hasn't been observed yet...and now he never will, because it is not granted posthumously.
$C: I had no idea his death would impact me so much, but he’s been on my mind all day. 
Stephen Hawking introduced me to the wonders of the universe.  He inspired me to begin studying physics and astronomy. I hope one day to be at least half as smart as he was. 

$C: His book A Brief History of Time was the most formative books I have ever read. Thank you Sir. 
$C: Perhaps science could bring him back to life someday.
$C: 

his TRUE legacy :  https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qj74uXkAAAAJ&hl=en
$C: May you live forever among the stars Mr. Hawking. You will be remembered as possibly one of the greatest physicists of all time. You have inspired many, done many things, and died a great man. Rest in Peace...
$C: This came as a huge surprise. Out of everyone you wouldn't have expected it to happen to him all of a sudden.
$C: He did more for science than he was ever expected to. A great man was lost, but the science goes on.
$C: Can’t believe I forgot to leave a comment until now, but even though I’m 22 hours late I still feel like I should. RIP Stephen Hawking, and thank you for being an inspiration to so many of us and the ultimate odds-beater
$C: #Praise be to the newest Champion of Reddit, u/ScienceModerator!

[Let us not forget the Champions of yore...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChampionsOfReddit/)
$C: Like Einstein, would his brain too would be examined for the areas responsible for intelligence ?
$C: Still feel he is too young to die.
$C: Stephen Hawking was not  a scientist but rather a natural philosopher.  Hawking never performed any experiments ever, had zero lab results, thinking is not by itself science and regardless of the math he might have used none of it reflected anything that was actually measured, rather it represented guesstiments of how principles might work.  Math is not by itself science either.

Which is not to say he was not smart, or held deep thoughts.  His thinking was valuable in and of itself, Natural Philosophy is where those thought belong not science. 
$C: I just feel so grateful for his contributions. It really amazes me how close we were to Hawking never living long enough to really discover or pave the way for anything. We are so fortunate to have been around to experience a mind and human being such as him. Thank you Dr. Hawking.
$C: Stephen I love you man, you will live on in our hearts and minds.



I feel like humanity just lost a Captain of the ship, and we are but a simple minded bunch of seamen and seawomen adrift the ocean of the present and future, with one fewer knowledgeable guide to help us stay on course.



Good luck humanity, we are one less Einstein once again.




$C: Other than his wounder and awh inspiring take on the universe I'm going to take away how normal he was! Just you down to earth guy in a really shit situation but who also happened to be the brightest mind of the 21st century and an insane sense of humour.  

$C: Thank you Mr. Hawking - you are finally one with the stars!
$C: 
I'm not afraid of death, but I'm in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first.

                                                             ---Stephen Hawking 

Very sad. Let's celebrate his life though, he had a good run for someone in his condition.
$C: Yeah I was informed.  The news here reported it initially as the 13th.
$C: A very successful person
$C: Rest in Peace. Hope his family and loved ones had the strength to cope through such a difficult time.
$C: Woah, top-voted post ever.  Stephen Hawking's final feat
$C: I still can't believe he's gone!
$C: Recently, I have re-newed my interest in science; I have been both touring lectures and studying textbooks.

The best way I can see to honour him is to study his work. Sleepless nights will tag along in the quest to honour this great man.
$C: Well he outlived far longer than ever imagined, and contributed to humanity more than I can understand. Rest in peace man. 
$C: Anybody has contacts with Stephen's relatives?
Please contact they and tell about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryonics
It's possible to save his brain in the lyquid N2, and maybe restore his mind in the simulation (in computer) using nano bots if mankind will get this technology in the future.
Any second, any minute the second law of termodinamics reduce information in remains of his brain which can be possible to restore! Please contact with his relatives imidiatly, if you have connection, please!
$C: Very sad to see him go
$C: The man born on death anniversary of Galileo and died on birthday of Einstein. 
$C: The greatest loss to the world of physics in decades if not centuries... an inspiration to all to never let limitations hold you back... the stars are the limit to your dreams. May he return as dust to the stars from whence he came.


$C: Incredibly sad. He will be sorely missed, but never forgotten. His contributions to physics will be remembered forever, and he immortalized because of them.
$C: He will live on through his work. 

RIP Mr. Hawking. 
$C: I know his voice will live on... 
$C: May he rest among the stars
$C: New Big Bang theory episode shall consist of Sheldon crashing the funeral!
$C: Lived a good long life despite his condition. Not many minds like his in the world. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: I bet they didnt realize he was dead for at least 20 minutes, considering hes looked dead for the last 50 years anyway.
$C: [removed]
$C: [deleted]
$C: [removed]
$C: [deleted]
$C: I hope I am not the only one who is crying right now. I can't believe he is gone. It's just... so out of nowhere. He was a great person, and did so much for the world, for human kind, for the universe. People like him don't come often. Actually, he was one of a kind.
$C: SUPER hot take incoming; one might say Thermodynamically so.

What did Stephen Hawking contribute to science that people with faith in God didn’t already know?

His main theory is that the center of Black Holes reduce everything that enters them into a “singularity,” which then pops out the other side into a new universe as a “Big Bang.”

He couldn’t, however, explain *why* this was happening, or how the force behind such phenomena came into existence in the first place.

Such understanding is wholly beyond our ability to comprehend, which is why the even older coined phrase came to be known as “Let there be light.”

$C: [removed]
$C: Not that anyone asked, but in comparison to the universe, Mr. Hawking was but a minuscule speck. His death has no greater astronomical significance

$C: It's Pi Day in Australia. How fitting.
$C: I didn’t know Stephen Hawking too well. I know he’s a scientist with a terrible disease. But that’s about it. What did he do for the science community? What were his scientific accomplishments that made him famous?
$C: Evangelicals, Muslims extremists and all sorts of other science deniers are going to be dancing tonight. Evil people.

$C: Unpopular Opinion: Steven Hawking didn’t contribute anything important to cosmology, astrophysics or science in general. (I know he made the study of black holes possible but how important is that honestly?)
$C: Pfft. He was a total asshole.
$C: 150 Syrians died a couple of weeks ago - no one gave a shit. An overrated cripple dies at 76 - the world goes mad. 
$C: [removed]
$C: The earth got rid of a complete fraud.
$C: why does anybody care? (legitimate question)
$C: What's so special about him? What good did he do for the world? Did he invent anything? He didn't do anything to survive the disease, he got lucky, he was born with high IQ, he didn't earn it.
$C: He made it to the right end of the probability distribution. 
$C: Truly incredible that he lived as long as he did
$C: By 50 years isn’t it? He was only diagnosed in his twenties
$C: >i guess he did outlive his life expectancy by 60 years

He thanks the NHS for that.

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/25/jeremy-hunt-attack-nhs-stephen-hawking-crisis
$C: still, probably the saddest I've been from a death in a very long time.  Such a loss for the world and humanity as a whole.
$C: It's the equivalent of you living to 136 years. It's really quite crazy that he was both so intelligent and so long living.
$C: Kind of thought he finally beat Death and would live forever
$C: Didn't he live longer than anyone with ALS in history?
$C: I believe it's appropriate to note that he gave the credit for that to the British NHS. Britain's social health care system.
$C: True
$C: > i guess he did outlive his life expectancy by 60 years

Doctors gave him only one year to live.
$C: So much for medical science
$C: He died on Einstein's birthday, and was born on Galileo's deathday.
$C: I think there’s no way to really prepare for death. The shock is always there no matter what you do. 

I think it’s the inevitability that’s the scariest part. Like you know it’ll happen but not when and that’s where the shock comes from. It’s reality crashing through like the Kool-Aid man. 

May Hawking rest in peace like he deserves. Bless that man. But I think he died a good death; he got to see his life’s work completed and he had his family with him. He died loved. 
$C: He died on PI day, which is kind of cool.
$C: I never expected to shed tears but I have.
$C: "You see the sun go down very slowly, and yet one is still surprised when it's suddenly dark."

Franz Kafka

this quote was on my grandma's obituary and i think it fits here, too.
$C: David Bowie
$C: Yeah I actually gasped when. I got the notification from my news app. 
$C: I wonder if he left a little nugget of info that no one other than himself knew about. THAT would be the ultimate goodbye to humanity. Not trying to discredit his other gifts to humanity. RIP 
$C: I thought it was coincidental that there were so man Steven Hawking post on the front page. Then I find this one.. Oh man, I'm shocked.   
$C: Just like when David Attenborough dies
$C: Kind of like your own 
$C: This better not start a trend of scientist deaths. I’m not sure I could handle that. 
$C: Indeed! I know it was a matter of time, but it’s still sad all the same.
$C: Same with Neil Armstrong. Just damn. RIP.
$C: i was hoping he would make it to the point science could save him.  :(
$C: Couldn't say it any better myself. Just heard the news and my jaw literally dropped. Still in shock. This world is will never be same. 
$C: i just talked to my stepmom on monday about him because my papa died of als in just under two years. it is a miracle to me that he lived for so long with it.
$C: What a fantastic man.  We’re going to miss him.
$C: It’s not often that scientists are known around the world like a movie star, but he’s a guy who deserved it. What a fantastic individual. Even took time out of his busy life to do a AMA on r/Science. What an inspirational person. Even though he might pass on, the people he inspired will live for a thousand years. 
$C: How did he live so long after? I know a guy with ALS that was in top condition. He’s 6 years in. They don’t expect him to see Christmas. This is better than normal. How did Hawking live so much longer?
$C: Me as well. Basically as long as I've been alive, Hawking has been a symbol of inspiration, achievement, and imagination.
$C: I haven't heard that quote before, but that's basically how I live my life after surviving cancer twice. Humanity has taken a big hit tonight.
$C: Why did he live so long?
$C: This is a serious issue, him being gone.
$C: It's really amazing he managed to live as long as he did;  I suspect more through bloodymindedness and sheer stubbornness than anything else.
$C: Im not crying
$C: “I wouldn’t compare it to sex, but it lasts longer,” - Stephen Hawking on the eureka moment of scientific discovery.
$C: He accomplished so much with the time he had, I hope he passed with few regrets- he certainly should be proud of the generations of people he inspired and his contributions to the scientific community 
$C: I wasn't ready for him to go. I can't believe it. The world still needs him to keep us moving forward. 
$C: "There are ten million million million million million million million particles in the universe that we can observe. Your momma took the ugly ones and put them into one nerd."  
-Stephen Hawking (on Epic Rap Battles of History) ❤
$C: "Science is not only a disciple of reason but, also, one of romance and passion."

That one really hit home.
$C: He’s one with The Force now...
$C: *whatever sound he made when laughing at the face of death for 49 years.
$C: Right in the feels. Soar high as you can now, professor. RIP
$C: That qoute is so motivational. It's such determined and beautiful qoute, I think you made my day.
$C: i'm just like steven hawking!

except for the "so much i want to do" part. 
$C: I've taken it as a sign. I've wanted to get my second tattoo for awhile now. When I first got out of the hospital, I had a lot of time on my hands, mostly spent romping around in my own mind trying to make sense of everything that'd happened along with how I sincerely felt about nearly dying. Like many, I turned to what I knew how to do best, in order to facilitate my coming to terms with, or have what I like to call my "Lt. Dan vs. The Hurricane moment"... I researched and wrote. On one of my many treks through the internet, using Google as my sherpa, I found a Stephen Hawking quote that felt very apropós for summing up the whole situation. The last 2 sentences especially. I ended up reading a lot on Hawking and slowly have been working my way through his writings. I've wanted it tattooed on me, I've wanted a second tattoo, seems perfect to shoot for. My best friend, Jeremy, even offered to scrall it on me (maybe his handwriting for the stencil for the pro to put it on. “I have lived with the prospect of an early death for the last 49 years. I’m not afraid of death, but I’m in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first.” RIP
$C: Makes me think of the quote from Interstellar.

"I'm an old physicist, Murph. I'm not afraid of death, what I'm afraid of is time."
$C: Cool quote bruv
$C: If only we had advanced enough to resleeve his stack! (Sci-fi, Altered Carbon)
This man who showed the humankind to never give up would be the ideal candidate to continue living till he found the answers to all the questions he had and inspire humanity to keep pushing further!
$C: " I'm not afraid of death, but I'm in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first. " - Stephen Hawking
$C: Eli5...what was his greatest contribution to modern science? Or is he just renowned for his disease?
$C: I wonder if he has left us some things he's been working on. 
$C: Such a somber pi day
$C: I’m at his college, Gonville & Caius, in Cambridge. I’ll definitely make an effort to sign his book of condolence, as he was on of the people that inspired me to science in the first place. RIP
$C: This is so sad. What a great man we've lost in the physical realm but will always present in our hearts and minds. My condolences to his family and friend. RIP you wonderful man. Now get to teaching God how things work and make them better!
$C: "Live Long and Prosper"
$C: How crazy is it that I read this in”his voice.” What an inspirational, let alone influential, human being.
$C: This is so sad... I feel like the world has lost it’s greatest mind..
$C: So we collectively pick up the torch 
$C: Another great man succumbing to the strongest disease yet 
$C: I really hope that he managed to do most of what he wanted to do RIP
$C: Ladies and gentlemen. Being a phycisist isn't important. Please work in defining a more precise mathematical language. Make technology easier, and please modify the way economy works. Too much stupid people has access to all the resources.
$C: What a life, though. I mean, damn.
$C: F for respect.
$C: If only he could have gotten broadband. His speeches would have been quicker. 
$C: "Like fearmongering about aliens and advances in artificial intelligence." Not the time but man did I disagree with alot of the things this guy said toward the end of his life.
$C: (from Hawking's 70th birthday speech at Cambridge)
$C: You have no idea how much I needed this quote right now. RIP to a revolutionary man. 
$C: And not to sound preachy but if someone with such a condition didn't give up then we should have no reason to give up either. This person and his work I didn't really know but his name and illness is quite known. To think he lived that long and achieved so much puts my "I can't do it" back into perspective. Not that from now on I'll be the overachiever but at least I shouldn't complain when I know I didn't try hard.
RIP.
$C: Taking this literally: I used to live in an area with fairly low light pollution and looking up at the sky, seeing the milky way in all its splendour, never ceased to amaze me. I'm currently living in a large city and it's sad to think that so many of the people that live here have never experienced that sight. 
$C: Comment saved.
$C: Thales of Miletus never looked at his feet. 
$C: Thank you for this, because my exact response to this news was “What’s the point if even Stephen Hawking dies?”

He was one of those people that was always just “supposed to be there.”
$C: These are beautifully spoken words. It captures some of what we all should strive to do as small beings in a universe beyond larger what we're able to grasp.
$C: Shut up I'm not crying.
$C: Oof, that inspires my lazy bum. Cheers 
$C: Great quote, thank you for posting it. 

RIP mate.
$C: A beautiful and uplifting Quote. 
$C: Great quote 
$C: Time for another existential-crisis then, damn

$C: I'm an entomologist. 
$C: You hit me right in the feels with that one, damn it. RIP Hawking, the world was blessed with your life.
$C: Wow this is something I try to teach and live by everyday thanks 
$C: > Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet.

But I'm a geologist :(
$C: but u can't trip on stars
$C: One of the world's most brilliant and beautiful minds has passed.  
$C: He was a visionary, he has left a huge gap in the world of science with his passing.
$C: It's very beautiful, people from around the world coming together to mourn someone who they all looked up to and respected. 
$C: There are things that we have to spend years in education to learn that he simply realized.
$C: His name shall be written in the stars: Hawking. His mind was his power, and his power was near boundless.

Farewell, Professor. It’s a rest you deserve.
$C: one of the last resonating voices of reason in this tumultuous world. truly a sad day for humanity.
$C: I won my first science competition because of his theories. A sad day for science.
$C: He actually paled in comparison to earlier scientists, those who actually pioneered GR and QM a few decades earlier. He just managed to live in the internet era so I feel like his legacy is exaggerated beyond what it actually is. Hawking didn't bring anything new to the table. He just expounded on already existing theories by earlier scientists.
$C: Watching him do what he did despite the obstacles he faced definitely inspired me to continue along my scientific career 
$C: I'm actually not distraught about this.  In an odd way, the universe is giving an homage to the man who probably understood it most, by allowing him to exist, then cease to exist.  He wasn't, then he was, now he isn't.

I first read A Brief History of Time in the 7th or 8th grade, and understood about half of it (the *easy* half).  Read it again as a senior in high school and understood about 75% of it.  I'm now 31, and read it again earlier this year, and now realize that I never even understood 10% of it.  If I'm being honest, I'm just now beginning to hear even the lightest of whispers of what he tried to teach to us, what he understood.

**I'm just happy that we were privileged to live during a time where we learned and grew our understanding of the world *alongside* Dr. Hawking. He wasn't some figure from a history book, he was a fellow living, breathing human being.**

Thank you and godspeed, Dr. Hawking.
$C: I don’t even begin to understand the tip of the iceberg of his knowledge, but I recognize the priceless aspect of his knowledge, along with the fact that he is one of the last truly famous physicists of our generation. I really hope that there are folks who can carry his spirit and push us to the lengths he imagined. 
$C: Couldn't agree more. In a time when maintaining the public's trust in science is becoming more and more difficult, what we really need are more people like Hawking.
$C: Hawking was as close to a superhero as we get in the real world. Unfortunately he was also as far away from a superhero as he was close.
$C: You've got the top comment on a thread that will be seen by millions  of people in the next 24 hours.

Would you consider editing your comment with a link to a worthy ALS charity for people to donate to in honor of Hawking?

The ASLA is a good one: http://www.alsa.org/donate/

Edit: it's now in the main post. Good on the mods!
$C: I feel very fortunate that I was able to see him speak last year at a conference. It was one of the most incredible moments of my life. I remember the air full of electricity when they announced him (he was the 'surprise guest') and the incredible silence when it was his turn to speak.

It's something I'll always cherish. That man was a treasure to this universe.


$C: I think the thing I liked best about him was that, while he was popular and inspiring--even to non-scientists, he never really tried to dumb it down and become a popular celebrity like Sagan or Tyson, or so many others.

Lately, it seems that the "famous" scientists are famous because they spend their time educating the general public about the basics of the universe and the solar system and other cool sci-fi things. (Nothing wrong with that, I'm glad they do it. But it does get a little frustrating to hear about "the wonders of the universe" for the umpteenth time on every science show.)

Hawking was quotable and could give a good, layman-level, simplified summary, but mostly the stuff he was working on was really, *really* hard! You can only simplify the implications of black-hole radiation so much.

Watching a pop-science lecture is educational and fun because they work to make it easy to understand.


Watching or reading a Hawking lecture is like trying to hit major-league pitching. Even if they go easy on you, it's just never going to be easy. You have to work as hard as you can to even get a piece of it, and Hawking (like Feynman) made you *want* to. To get just a little taste of what it's like to play in the big leagues.
$C: He was definitely an icon within the field and an inspiration for many. He will be missed dearly.
$C: Same here. I remember reading The Universe in a Nutshell when I was 15 and wanting to be a theoretical physicist. Even though my interests changed, the passion for science in general that his writings inspired has stuck with me to this day. 
$C: He captured my imagination as well. I appreciate all that he's done.
$C: The man sat alongside a few individuals in my life who not only inspired me with their abilities, but also with their tenacity. The man fought multiple battles both internal and external at all times. He chose to continue to push forward in the face of getting the most feared diagnosis of many. Truly a hero for me and always will be. He deserves some rest.
$C: He was one of the people I would think about now and again, worrying about his longevity. People that it would hurt when they pass away. 
$C: He got me excited for science as a kid to. I'm not into the sciences professionally, but the analytical approach and that interest has been with me my whole life and shaped how I approach day to day life.

As a kid, Stephen Hawking, Bill Nye, and my uneducated immigrant father were the 3 biggest drivers for my interest in science
$C: He was extremely nice to kids in person, too. When I was 16, two of my friends and I snuck away from a mini study abroad for American highschoolers in Cambridge. We found his office and knocked on his door. The fact that he took 20 minutes out of his day to chat with 3 nerdy highschoolers interrupting his lunch was incredibly impactful to me. (And the picture still hangs in my hallway 15 years later.)
$C: ne nox mitis in bonum
$C: I'm going to miss Stephen Hawking. Seriously.
$C: Pi day needs to become a official holiday now. 
$C: may he rest in pi day
$C: I feel like we just got set back 50 years in science. RIP
$C: > He was instrumental in inspiring so many with a love for science. Even as someone in a totally unrelated field

I hope the new generation can find someone like Hawking. He was the reason I saw myself in a labcoat twenty, thirty years away. And now I'm starting my education into psychology, ecstatic to know that I may one day help build upon humanity's knowledge.

We stand on the shoulder of giants so that we can see further.

And we will remember Hawking for the rest of our days as his work grants us new visions to every field of science.
$C:  He just had to ruin my Pi day. 
$C: I can only echo your thoughts, as does everyone here. My field is not really that close to his (currently studying for a Mechanical Engineering degree), but ever since I was a kid and still today I have a deep interest on space and the universe, and the weird stuff that may be out there, some of which may not apply to our current physics model. Hawking brought us many, many steps closer to a full understanding. And dare I say that in centuries to come, we'll still remember him, both as an example of perseverance and as a modern Isaac Newton. 

I may never have been qualified enough to fully understand his theories and contributions, but I listened to everything he had to say. And despite all he went through, man did he have a sense of humour! Just amazing all around. I'm proud to have shared this moment in time with him.
$C: He was one of THE nodes for thought processes that propagated throughout humanity.  I've never cried for someone I never knew personally before.  This is a hard one.  Rest in peace.
$C: He was so brilliant, and its crazy to think doctors told him he would only live til his mid twenties.  One of the most amazing people there are, and someone I looked up to quite a lot
$C: I would say this is a sad day for all. He offered to much to humanity and human understanding and I have no doubt that he still had so much more to offer. This is the only celebrity death I have shed tears for because his means more than a simple loss of a human life. We lost a gateway to better understanding the universe. May his soul rest easy now.
$C: It's a mixed kind of feeling, when you realize that today is also Albert Einstein's birthday! 
$C: As I kid I watched some show on TV where he talked about the theories of the creation of the universe and he was one of the reasons I am now an astrophysics major in college. The world lost a truly amazing human being today. 
$C: Seriously. I ended up pursuing science a bit, and while it didn't pan out as a career for me, I still have always had massive respect for the man. Also Hawking radiation is some of the coolest shit ever pondered. 
$C: He’s someone I’m so sad has died, but just so incredibly glad he lived. 
$C: I’m studying engineering right now. I wouldn’t be today without the inspiration of Stephen Hawking as a child 
$C: It‘s the same for me. As a Kid I often watched science shows (for kids) and was really excited. After that I moved on to read/watch more complex topics - often related to Hawking or Einstein. Even though I work in something different, today I’m a huge science and space fan. 

I‘m glad that due to people like Hawking, Tesla and many more, I may be still alive when local space travel starts.

Thank you Hawking and all the others <3 Your work is something that will stay with humanity forever
$C: A sad day for all humanity. The dude was a comedian,a strong person and an amazing mind.
$C: > A sad day for **scientists and science enthusiasts** around the world.

[Thank you for making two categories, there is a pretty big difference.](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comics/20100130.gif)
$C: >Even as someone in a totally unrelated field, Hawking was one of the people that made me excited about science as a kid. 

Absolutely.
$C: He will not be forgotten. Our children will stand on his shoulders in the pursuit of knowledge. 
$C: Same. I'm struggling with depression and anxiety and had to drop my courses this semester because I'm just too sick. When I think it's too hard, and I'm never going to get better, I'm going to try to remember him. If he could push through it all and become who he was, I can try too. I won't give up hope.
$C: Absolutely. He was a great icon for science and inspired so many.
$C: And his Fututama cameos were on point.

RIP
$C: He was the epitome of r/nevertellmetheodds
$C: "My expectations were reduced to zero when I was 21. Everything since then has been a bonus."

 \- Stephen Hawking
$C: Will be watching The Theory of Everything again
$C: A good run? I dream of having a run approaching a minuscule percentage of Stephen Hawking’s run.
$C: [deleted]
$C: The fact that he was able to live as long as he did is incredible, plus his contributions to science? "Extraordinary" doesn't seem like a strong enough word. 
$C: Yea, I was always under the impression that when you get ALS you're done by your 30's. He lived to 76.
$C: it's all relative
$C: Yeah considering he was "supposed to die" 30 years ago, he had a hell of a run. Hope he felt fulfilled at the end
$C: I am convinced he survived by the sheer power of his great mind. I don't foresee us having another great mind like his for a long time. 
$C: He had a good life for someone in any condition.
$C: He had an amazing run for anyone. He accomplished more than a great many of us will. When people talk about how a disability should be considered an archaic term because the differently abled are extremely capable, Stephen Hawking is the example you should think of. By his own account he would not have done nearly as much as he did if had been healthy. 

No offense was taken but I want to make it a point that Professor Hawking is definitely not someone to be described by their illness, given their great accomplishment.
$C: I think that aside from being one of the greatest physicists of all time, he was also one of the greatest successes of modern medicine
$C: for someone in his condition? it was legendary regardless of all else
$C: He had a good run for someone in any condition.
$C: True indeed. Cheated death and used all those years to give us new insights. Very sad to see him leave, but extremely happy to have lived in his time. 
$C: I wonder how many people with his and other disabilities have been overlooked or had their potential missed out on just because they've been 'parked' by the system...
$C: I kinda feel horrible doing this, but are we not doing phrasing anymore?  
  
Joke aside, it's definitely a great loss. He was one of the greats, and his absence will be felt for a long time. 
$C: Wouldn’t call it a run
$C: >	for someone in his condition.

Uhhh... For anyone? 
$C: For anyone in any condition. 
$C: 76 is good for anyone 
$C: I don't think he had a good run since the 70s, honestly.

Seriously though, a legend of intellect. A man we can all be proud of. 
$C: He had a good run even for someone who didn't have his condition. 
$C: In good condition most people can't do what he did.  This man won one hell of a lottery to live as long as he did
$C: I agree. Children of the future are going to read textbooks about Stephen Hawking as we did about Albert Einstein in school, and to know you where on the same ground as that amazing man. For it to be an honor is an understatement. 
$C: A friend of mine went to an open day years ago at Cambridge university (at least I assume it was Cambridge, what with Stephen Hawking teaching there), and at one point he and all the prospective students were standing in the hallway asking Stephen Hawking questions;

"How does it feel being the smartest man alive?"

"Did it feel strange being so famous so young?"

"What else are you working on at the moment?"

And what did my friend ask?

"Um... how fast can you chair go?"

"... I'll show you."

And Steve zoomed off down the corridor.
$C: It feels really uncanny, now that you think about it.
$C: I had the precise same reaction to his death. I’m an astrophysicist graduate and assuming my children grow up with the same iinterest they will no doubt grow up in awe that I was alive at the same time as Hawking. He’ll be a legend for generations. It truly was an honour.
$C: I agree, I actually live near Cambridge and saw him around twice and met him once! I was about 12, my friend and I were going to the cinema in town and bumped into him, didn't realise straight away but then went over and said we were huge fans and admirers of his work, he said thank you so much then his handler explained they were going to eat so he left.

A small encounter but I'll never forget it. Science has and always will fascinate me and he was a truly magnificent face of it for our generation.
$C: Beautifully said.
$C: It was a a honor learning from him. Thank you for keep me fascinated and curious. RIP
$C: Why taric and not ezreal?
$C: Add some Latin on the end please
$C: That was beautiful
$C: ric flair, is that you? 
$C: You have way with words.
$C: I have no words but to say that those are beautiful words.
$C: Is it wrong if I almost cried
$C: For some reason I read this with Ric Flair's voice.
$C: Reminds me of Clyde Frazier's commentary.

Beautiful. RIP
$C: Heavy co-sign.
$C: I was already drinking tonight. One more is surely worth it for him.
$C: Woo!
$C: Awesome. Touched my heart. 
$C: Woke up super somber today, thank you for making me laugh.

$C: I really liked that. I read it in killer B’s voice from Naruto. 
$C: He was a true fighter who beat all odds to contribute heavily to science and humanity as a whole.. Will be dearly missed
$C: In an extremely painful irony, [Hawking doesn't appear to have said that](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/07/20/knowledge/). 
$C: So the greatest enemy of knowledge is r/Iamverysmart ?
$C: "We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special"
$C: Honest question, what's the difference? 
$C: Reddit in a nutshell here. The slogan for this website should be "people who don't know anything pending to know everything"
$C: While this is a great quote it can't be attributed to him it seems https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/07/20/knowledge/
$C: For sure... Dream well Mr. Hawking's, was always a fan.
$C: Good quote I like RIP
$C: People have too many opinions
$C: I’m pretty sure Socrates actually said that
$C: I bet Hawking had some head-banging-against-the-wall arguments.
$C: Except it was actually [Daniel J. Boorstin who said that](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/07/20/knowledge/), not Hawking. Or were you posting that ironically?
$C: I heard this when I was at school and it changed how I viewed the world. 
$C: That gave me goosepumps
$C: Basically Dunning-Kruger effect. The mantra of every college graduate who feels their opinion in anything outside of the basic academic understanding of their specific field is somehow weighted in relevancy.

Sorry, I've been interviewing phase/electrical engineering students the last two weeks and I'm starting to favor the survival of the fittest model for the particular generation. 

RIP Professor Hawking. The guys at the Kennedy lab are having a big celebration this Friday in his honor. 
$C: On pi day no less :\(
$C: Legends never die.
$C: Same, I just decided to check Reddit for only a minute and see this at the top. I sat there for a minute, just staring at the title.
$C: I came to this thread just to ask this. I hadn’t heard anything about his health recently so I’m assuming this came out of no where? What a life though, dude was a trooper. 
$C: It did for me. I’m sitting on the couch in my underwear and now I’m in tears, I didn’t even know I cared.
$C: Still can't find the cause of death tho
$C: I was watching netflix getting ready to go to sleep then checked reddit and it hit me like a truck
$C: Yeah, death can come from nowhere. 
$C: It did for me, even though it really shouldn't have. If anything, it's very surprising that he made it this far. 

Still, sad news.
$C: It is Pi day 
$C: That makes me so happy to read. I hope even after death Stephen Hawking’s legacy continues to inspire generations to take an interest in science. 
$C: RIP. Against all odds, he did so much for the world.
$C: He said he was happy. He said he was happier than before he got the illness.
$C: It's not a miracle, it's thanks to the NHS.  He said it himself.
$C: That's my void, there's no one left. Who on intellect alone is nearly as popular? Will inspire millions? I can think of no one and that saddens me. 
$C: > No other scientist is even half as popular as he was.

For good reason. The world is a lesser place for his loss, and a better place for his impact.
$C: > No other scientist is even half as popular as he was.

Dr. Tyson is probably as well known at this point, though the impact he has had on his field is not remotely as profound as Dr. Hawking's impact on his field.

Dr. Brian Cox seems to have quite a following, though he's not NEARLY as well known outside of nerdy circles.

Dr. Michio Kaku is pretty well known, but... probably not half as much as Hawking.

Dr. Kip Thorne and Dr. Leonard Susskind are both still around, though not really part of pop culture.

Oh, and there's my favorite living physicist: Dr. Brian May. You *may* have heard some of his work. :)

And lets not forget the physicists, chemists, mathematicians, etc that are making absurdly high quality content for YouTube. Don't laugh! There's a renaissance of science popularization happening *right now*. Content that would *never* find a place on television is being made available for free by universities and creators around the world.
$C: I'd argue even more for his popularity. His name was almost as renowned as albert einstein and his image perhaps more so. Maybe it's somewhat different growing in the states, but from the point of view of a couple of countries I resided in, a vast majority would at least have an idea of who hawking was while not many know about sagan at all.
$C: How about Stephen Gould?
$C: Bill nye the science guy is here
$C: Did you seriously forget Newton?
$C: Bill nye tho 🤔🤔
$C: Let me introduce you to my friend, Mr. Nye.  He's sort of a science guy.
$C: The actual fuck? He never reached Bill Nye level.  Not to mention half as popular, Michio Kaku 
$C: For some reason I thought he was immortal because he has been apart of my life in like pop culture for so long. I guess that kind of does make him immortal
$C: Dexter's Lab was where I first learned about him too. That was a great episode. RIP.
$C: I've always wanted to meet him in person. I kinda feel sad now but it's life. RIP
$C: Also Einstein's birth date
$C: Also the birthday of Albert Einstein. It's like one book that was opened long ago finally closed. Of all of the days this could happen, I can't find a more fitting day. I know I will be remembering Dr. Hawkings on pi day from now on.
$C: Not that it is PI day where he died... 
$C: I don't think he would agree. He was not from the US
$C: Oh wow! I didn't realize it's Pi day!
$C: Pretty early on too. Bet it was pi exactly.

Although he wouldn't have considered it Pi day, considering that us British stick to the correct way of listing dates ;)
$C: It would only happen 4 out of 1461 times!
$C: Thanks that made me grin
$C: classy.
$C: r/wholesome
$C: >He died on Pi day

So? he was a scientist not a mathematician.
$C: Not many people are considered capable of holding the same professorship as Sir Isaac Newton.

I mean, man, that's incredible.

I remember him saying that his biggest regret was that his computer voice spoke with an American accent.  Heh.
$C: Trapped in his body but still driving the field. Truly an incredible mind and man.
$C: This is beautiful, when my mom passed the first law of thermodynamics was the first thing I thought of as a non religious person. 
$C: Speaking of that...I bet it'll be one helluva funeral.
$C: Could not have said it better myself. This is a tremendous loss.
$C: I didn't know him or follow him too much, but he was a background facet of my life, and, as a younger person, the first well-known death that has affected me. Rest in piece to an icon of science. 
$C: I wonder what his last words are. I'm pretty sure they must be documented.
$C: I want to cry. Never had to say such words, looking back I can see his book and personality had a profound effect on my teenage.  
My vocabulary isn't big enough (English isn't my first language) to describe how I'm feeling right now. 
$C: Today is *not* a good day for science 😣
$C: He truly will be remembered. Not many scientists have been in the public conscious like he has, not to mention having an acclaimed movie based on them while they're still alive. What an incredible life with his condition, IIRC he was given 2 years to live in 1963.
$C: He's up there with greats like Carl Sagan who captured the public eye and used their platform to help advance society's interest in science 
$C: That Latin at the end is so beautiful 
$C: I read that in his voice
$C: For those wondering, the Latin is "thus one journeys to the stars".
$C: We'll intermingle with him again when we've all decayed to infrared radiation at the end of it all. 
$C: [sic itur ad astra](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sic%20itur%20ad%20astra)
$C: He truly is a legend.
$C: O quam cito transit gloria mundi
$C: We are star dust, and to dust Stephen has returned.
$C: Annals
$C: I'm pretty sure he's already seen that way. 
$C: He already is
$C: I don't think so.  No one is gonna call someone doing something stupid a Hawking.

But will always call them an Einstein
$C: He is definitely the greatest mind of our time.
$C: > In 50 years

What? I don't know where you've been, but he's easily been the current age's Einstein for a while now.
$C: Link?
$C: >he worked on black home theory for a long time with their existence and properties.

Didn't realize he was in to urban development.


$C: Yeah man black homes are wild
$C: Yeah that's false.
$C: And eat a pi(e) in his honor. Not just a slice. Only a whole pi(e) is worthy.
$C: Also Einstein's birthday RIP.
$C: Pi continues infinitely, no reason Steven Hawking's influence can't do the same.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I hardly know *anything* about Stephen Hawking beyond what I've learned in schools and I'm absolutely mortified 



He always seemed like the kind of person you wanted to cheer for, given he accomplished like so much in his life with an extremely debilitating illness. 


We'll miss you S.H. :(
$C: I think in the end we can just be grateful for all the years that he had and for the fact that he made the most of the time that he had 
$C: I always looked up to him but I don't think I realized how much I really grew to respect and care for him.. until tonight. He will be missed more than he knows.
$C: Mine was Michael Jackson. Never knew them personally, but definitely one to change the game. 
$C: Robin williams : (
$C: Mine was Steve Jobs bizarrely. Probably because they both affected my life and are named Steve. I have to go now.
$C: Yeah, this is a tough one. Guy had a hell of a life but god damn, what a brilliant mind to lose. 
$C: Gord Downey and Mr. Lahey in the same week. 
$C: "We are like butterflies who flutter for a day and think it is forever."

- Carl Sagan
$C: I don't know why, but there was alway this little part of me that just thought he'd live forever.
$C: Nov. 8 2016
$C:  When Terry Pratchett died :(
$C: I haven’t felt like this since my father killed himself.   

I truly feel I have lost someone very close to me and I never met the man.   
$C: What a fortunate life you lead. Im envious.
$C: At 76 with ALS he had an extremely good run.  This could have happened 30 years ago. So while I understand your sadness, devistation would be more suited for a young and healthy person. 
$C: I cried until my eyes hurt when Steve Irwin died, that was the last time for me 
$C: Really?
Devastated?
Do you know the word?

I guess it's possible you are using it correctly.  But that would mean you never had a family member die before this.


$C: Learning just for the sake of learning, for the beauty of it - that’s the best kind of learning.
$C: Kinda-but-only-slightly like the time Steve Irwin died.  As an Australian, I was a bit embarrassed by him for many years (figuring it was all a corny put-on for the camera) but a month or two before he passed I watched an interview with him and saw that he was the real deal.  He was just so passionate about wildlife that it came bursting out in over-exuberant ways.  Then, he was gone.

We should be happy such amazing personalities existed at the same time as us, their passion and talents are an inspiration.
$C: That'no rant. It's a wonderful testimony.
$C: i was thinking maybe his passing will inspire a wave of increased self education of the sciences which can only have one effect on society: improvement
$C: We need to heed his last declarations:

1) Explore into space for survival of human race

2) climate change

3) his warning against ai 
4) supporting the right to die by ones own choice if they wish it. 
5) stop using god as a way to excuse the natural order of how the universe functions. It has nothing to do with a personified god.
$C: Best wishes to your kitty.
$C: Best wishes for your cat
$C: Hope he/she is okay 
$C: Meow meow meow meow meow.
$C: I like to think of it that such a fantastic mind was given to us. He was supposed to die within 2 years of his diagnosis yet he went on for almost 60 years and became one of the greatest minds of our time. He left behind his legacy of knowledge that future generations will still be able to benefit from. 
$C: So it’s negative now?
$C: He hates iq and iq test and the concept of them.
$C: Part of it maybe is because of his condition, he didn't really appear to age as much as you would notice in someone without it, plus the voice didn't age at all.
$C: Powerful quote. 
$C: Aka god and religion.

He once said the way the universe is constructed has no room or need for god.
$C: Agree.
$C: He was born on Galileo’s death date 
$C: Pi day.
$C: If anyone ever was going to travel back in time if they could, it would be him. I reckon we'll see him turn up at his funeral and tip a wink to a few people before disappearing off in a of off smoke.
$C: #denial
$C: The doctor said he will not be expected to see his 25th birthday, I say he did have an incredible life base on the fact alone. RIP Stephen Hawking.
$C: On Einstein's birthday RIP to one of the most brilliant humans to ever live.
$C: I find this oddly calming.
$C: Yep. And he was a very vocal supporter of the NHS. What a great man. Rest in peace Hawkings. :'(
$C: I guess he just couldn't dodge that last death panel!
$C: I want to ask, do you study computer science while having a primary interest in theoretical physics? How do you tie the two together?
$C: In the UK, where it isn't pi day 
$C: What was the question?
$C: Apparently he actually died on the 13th, so it's not.
$C: Patterns are everywhere. 
$C: ok
$C: [deleted]
$C: Dr. Hawking was born on death anniversary of Galileo, and he died on birthday of Einstein - also a Pi day. 
$C: Hoping him and Carl Sagan are having a blast together!
$C: Yeah I am sure he cares... STFU
$C: Exactly the same as me dude. I was finally starting to properly appreciate why he’s such an important and well respected figure :c
$C: WHadudtalkin bulto?
$C: Wonder if that's the same incident posted on here when the poster's friend asked him how fast his chair could go?
$C: He probably wouldn't like that. He was kind of against sending the first ones.
$C: Maybe his cameo from the Simpsons?
$C: It does feel a bit bleaker. 
$C: No. Einstein was born in April, I'm pretty sure. I don't know the exact date. But I fairly certain it was April. 
$C: I just did it to keep the thread up. I definitely don't like it :(
$C: You and me both, shocking.
$C: Maybe to the layman, but I still can't wait for the tribute episode!
$C: Carry on his legacy and research. He is immortal.
$C: We're going to have a wine and cheese reception tomorrow to celebrate his physics.
$C: > 3 pictures


“Vision board”
$C: You are literally disgracing Hawkins by putting him alongside Bill Nye. Shame on you. 
$C: I think its cool you have a vision board! Just a thing to set your mind the right way! Good luck in your life
$C: That's a really cool board. Stephen may have gone but I hope his inspiration and motivation remain with you for a lifetime. 
$C: You could not have chosen 3 better pictures. Just from the pictures I am reminded that I dont have to be the smartest or strongest and not to let race or any thing else stand in the way of my goals.  
$C: Maybe find other people than pop science celebrities 
$C: [removed]
$C: [deleted]
$C: I don't think Stephen Hawkins ever went to a mental hospital
$C: Fuck You 
$C: Quit the fake sadness 
$C: Of
$C: [removed]
$C: I was discussing it with my psychology professor a few days ago when we were going over ALS and alzheimer's in class. :(
$C: He did, he died in the UK.
$C: Wow, that's beautiful. So in that way, his efforts will never truly be gone, just part of the infinity that is the universe. 
$C: One of the most famous people on the planet. Some media celebrities would overshadow his fame but come nowhere near to his contributions to the world.
$C: America is literally better than England in every conceivable way. Dont even start. You guys had the lead and blew it. 
$C: Not really, I dont think anyone would consider him one of the greatest minds. But he popularized commercial science for sure. Just don't give him credit for being one of the greatest minds. 
$C: Not really a great loss, a vastly overrated physicist. He just died cause he old. 
$C: /u/anemojipastabot
$C: Same. Even more tears than last time I now suspect.
$C: what a brilliant mind, imagine had he be healthy and fully rid of illness in his adult life
$C: Hookers and cocaine. (Probably)
$C: The Bob Ross of his field.
$C: That's very strange.
$C: Yea he's a prankster. One time his friend tied strings to his limbs and used them to control him. People thought he was walking around until he revealed it was a prank. 
$C: Very very smart
$C: Imagine you are grieving over a loved one and suddenly you have random strangers telling you what to do with his body parts.
$C: I'm pretty sure you don't speak for the science community
$C: Someone gild this madman
$C: Always look on the bright side of life
$C: "Yeah, I hope people smarter than me die so now I won't look as dumb."
$C: Amazing how Stephen Hawking dies and you find a way to make it about yourself.
$C: Cringe 
$C: What do you mean out of nowhere? Even he knew that every day was an uphill challenge. 
$C: I don't mean to be *that guy* but dude had a debilitating condition and was nearly 80 years old...  How was it anything less than expected?
$C: What are some of the many things he did for "the world, for human kind, for the universe"?
$C: You are absolutely right: No one asked.
$C: [removed]
$C: What? What does this have to do with anything? Also, if it was, we don't know how it is determined yet, so people will still try to live longer.
$C: Our hypocracy is not our fault. We had no choice. 
$C: New people are born all the time, odds are at least one of the greatest minds of the 21st century currently need their diaper changed.
$C: No.  Time.

^/s

$C: Nobody invented gravity.
$C: 'Invented' gravity? How the fuck do you invent something that already exists.
$C: Except it is 3/14 in england 
$C: He has children, Google this shit.
$C: It's also when  Slovakia declares independence under German pressure. Makes you think. 
$C: He had lots of TV show cameos, he was like in 5 Episodes of Simpsons
$C: Why is it only extremist Muslims and not extremist Evangelicals? Just out of curiosity. 
$C: Fuck off.
$C: More like a person trying to see beyond God, I would say. Not everyone is obligated to support your views and religion.
$C: I mean, its not insignificant.
$C: [removed]
$C: Ok, take your pills and take off your tin foil hat. Stop spamming this everywhere - you look insane.
$C: So, he didn't die in the day Einstein was born but instead on the birthday of Michel Blavet, French flute player and composer (d. 1768). Makes you think
$C: You have missed what he gave to the world. Though no excuse for what has transpired.  Still not yet to blame for those inconsistencies. But whole heartedly the pure resson for progression in what we call our lives. 
$C: Yeah but how many of them were on the Big Bang Theory?

Check and mate.
$C: Aren't you a ray of sunshine.
$C: Yeah just go away 
$C: [removed]
$C: Dat b8 tho.
$C: Because he was an inspiration for so many people
$C: Because if we were asked to name living scientists , he was one of the three names everywhere knew. But now it's just two and everyone would feel a bit dumber for knowing just two pop scientists
$C: Lots of people with high IQs don't advance knowledge of science at all
$C: Why do you feel the need to be disrespectful? He was clearly a man with high standing in the scientific world. 
$C: Tell me, how does one earn a high IQ? He contributed so much to science. Cosmology, general relativity and quantum gravity, especially in the context of black holes too.

Edit. From looking at your comment history, you need serious help.
$C: You very cleary do not know about his contributions to the science world.
$C: [removed]
$C: Labmate of mine called him the improbable outlier today because of that (in the best of senses).
$C: Opportunity  Rover in human form

$C: That's a line for his headstone. 
$C: Forty standard deviations 
$C: Dude was at 5 sigma. 
$C: When people want a miracle I use Hawking as an example. What are the odds someone who wasn't supposed to live past their 20s would live to be 76, and not only blow most people away with his intelligence but pretty much reinvent how we saw the trait and who can have it? If he was born before recorded history the sensible thing to do would be to disregard him as a folktale because obviously someone just made him up. 
$C: The man accomplished more than most people could dream of.
$C: Yes. But still incredible.
$C: Yeah, he was expected to die at 23.
$C: He became the person who live second longest ever with ALS.
$C: It’s terribly sad. But think about this: his life has inspired so many. He is still accomplishing things, just through those he taught. Through us. His death reminds the rest of the world that science holds the answers, and that if we hope to change the way history is being written, it starts with science. And ANYONE and EVERYONE can. It sounds callous, but his death brings publicity to the scientific community. Something we desperately need. 
$C: It's also Pi Day, 3/14 = 3.14

 Rather apropos considering
$C: Hoping today another great mind is born. 
$C: wow
$C: That ruined the party for sure. Einstein is inconsolable.
$C: Soooo then someone was born today that’s going to think up some shit..
$C: Will never be forgotten
$C: Did Galileo not die on January 8th?
$C: New headcanon: These 3 guys are the same person connected via time-travelling reincarnation
$C: Does this mean the next great scientist has been born today?
$C: He also died the same age as Einstein... 
$C: If any mind is capable of figuring out reincarnation through relativistic time it would be theirs **strokes chin hair*\*
$C: What a coincidence, wow.
$C: He liked to point out that he was born 300 years, down to the day, after Galileo's death. 
$C: And thus the genius is reborn!
$C: Though I know neither Einstein nor Hawking were religious, I just want to believe and think that both of them are chatting it up right now about physics. That would be a conversation to behold! 

Rest In Peace Stephen! 
$C: And loved by the world, not many can say that.
$C: I was depressed for a really long time not long ago. Felt like I wanted to die. 

Last year I almost died from a undiagnosed disease, came in with heart failure and kidney failure. Its amazing the bodies undenying response to keep itself alive. I was scared shitless. Made me view life from a different perspective. 
$C: I think its good that we usually dont know when we have to leave this world.

Hawking was a very amazing person.
$C: How can you explain I'm not shocked ? When I saw the title I was like "Age 76 with ALS is a pretty good score". I guess it's because I wasn't attached to him that I see it this way. 
$C: Everyone wants to go to heaven, but no one wants to die.
$C: I think death is no longer as inevitable as you think, healthcare and aging research are coming a long way.

Regardless, I agree with the rest. Stephen Hawking was an incredible man, and I’m glad he died peacefully.
$C: Check out the tune "Inevitability of Death" by the Tragically Hip.
$C: He will go down as one of the most influential minds of the century. Overcoming every obstacle in his insatiable pursuit for knowledge.
$C: "It’s clearly possible for a something to acquire higher intelligence than its ancestors: we evolved to be smarter than our ape-like ancestors, and Einstein was smarter than his parents. The line you ask about is where an AI becomes better than humans at AI design, so that it can recursively improve itself without human help. If this happens, we may face an intelligence explosion that ultimately results in machines whose intelligence exceeds ours by more than ours exceeds that of snails."

Holy balls that's scary to think about
$C: Have a link? 
$C: Stephen Hawking's final comment on the internet, if you're interested... 

https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/84andj/stephen_hawkings_final_comment_on_the_internet/
$C: He was the most famous living scientist by far, I think... Can't think of anyone else who comes close.
$C: I’ve read some articles speculating that he didn’t have “typical” ALS, but some variant that didn’t have the same rapid decline. 
$C: My uncle died from ALS about 2 years ago. My aunt had thought his alcoholism was getting the best of him and he want to in patient treatment. His motor skills got a bit better after that. But he was still having problems. They went to a doctor to figure out what was going on. They found out about it sometime in September I think it was. It was so sad to see such a strong willed man just deteriorate like that over the course of a few months. We knew he didn't have long and his daughter was getting married in the spring but we had a ceremony at his home before he passed. He didn't last much longer after that. I took a video of the ceremony and at one point he looks back at me in the video and I can see how far gone he is when you look into his eyes it still haunts me a bit and I'll probably never show that video to anyone just because of how empty he looked at that point.

$C: ALS is a fickle b****. I am 37 and almost four years into the disease. I used to be an avid Runner and cyclists, but now require help to even dress myself or make it to my scooter. Next week I get measured up for a wheelchair. ALS is more of a grouping of conditions by a set of symptoms. It seems to be different for everyone on how fast it progresses. I was diagnosed after having symptoms for two years and given about one year to live. I'm still here and, sadly, Stephen is not. May he rest in peace.
$C: As rare as it is for him to live that long, he is indeed an outlier, but not unheard of. 

Neuroscientists have recorded such cases. 

The disease does not care for his physical state, or the power of his mind. A neuroscientist was asked this question, and he said he does not believe his intellectual ability and positive mind had anything to do with it. 

Joost vd versthuizen.. top springbok who won the 95 World Cup, and a very positive person, did not last long with als.

It was just the way his disease progressed.
$C: [deleted]
$C: IIRC, it was from the end of one of the space shows he did. "How the universe works" or something like that. Sorry, it's 4am and I'm about to jump in the shower before heading to work, otherwise I'd look up the clip for you. I thought the wording of the quote was a little different, but you get the point.
$C: 'It would not be much of a universe if it wasn’t home to the people you love.’ - Stephen Hawking
$C: I love this, and it seems so much funnier in contrast to this news...
$C: Has he ever had sex? 
$C: How the fuck would he fuck?
$C: What're a few regrets when he's accomplished so much, what a great man to go down in history. 
$C: Dude had an amazing bonus round.
$C: when i was learning the maths of hawking radiation, it felt so different than learning newton's or einstein's work. those guys always seemed mythical, whereas stephen hawking has always been so real. i am sad that he has gone, but he left a lot of good in his wake. 
$C: > The world still needs him to keep us moving forward.

No, he has done his part and shared his knowledge.

Now it's our turn.
$C: That's why your here bud.  Keep us going, you got this!
$C: This is why the world needs education and equal opportunities. You never know which country has the next Hawking.
$C: The world needs no single person but to get its collective better together.
$C: I'm sure he left behind a lifetime of knowledge. Whether right or wrong, he was brilliant. 
$C: This is devastating news. I never understood why people would feel sad when a celebrity passed away until today. His contribution to our society will leave a great legacy. He was a true bright shining star.  
$C: Hawking lives in the legacy of his work and the people that he has inspired. In that fact, I am 15 years old and looked up to him since I was 6, and I have a vigorous passion for the sciences because of him. 
$C: Excelsior
$C: Bear solace in the fact that there are probably a dozen 9 year olds on this planet who will make similar contributions to science. We may have lost a star this day, but more burn on and more will continue to be born, on and on. Humanity is just getting started.
$C: "Now, more than at any time in our history, our species needs to work together. We face awesome environmental challenges: climate change, food production, overpopulation, the decimation of other species, epidemic disease, acidification of the oceans.

Together, they are a reminder that we are at the most dangerous moment in the development of humanity. We now have the technology to destroy the planet on which we live, but have not yet developed the ability to escape it. Perhaps in a few hundred years, we will have established human colonies amid the stars, but right now we only have one planet, and we need to work together to protect it."

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/01/stephen-hawking-dangerous-time-planet-inequality
$C: Humanity will always move forward. People probably said the same thing you just said when Einstein died but we kept moving forward. There will be many great minds like Hawking. We'll all be fun.
$C: Wait how aaaah
$C: Rest in peace.

But not really. The world doesn't need him to keep moving forward. 
$C: I’m studying at his college, Gonville & Caius, in Cambridge. I’ll definitely make an effort to sign his book of condolence, as he was on of the people that inspired me to study science in the first place. RIP
$C: Wasn't it his 75th birthday speech?

http://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/SWH (see third and second last paragraph)
$C: Thank you for the context.
$C: Me too. I’ve been in contemplation about the universe lately, coupled with a lot of depression. This has been the first death in a long time that’s hit me with any real significance. But reading his words give me hope. Thank you Dr. Hawking.
$C: Never stop always thinking, my friend! You can do it.
$C: It's not preachy, this is part of why he's been such an inspiration to many. It's hopeful to see someone fight immense adversity with such grace and to somehow still find his place on this planet. His example doesn't make me feel as much like a failure when health issues put me down, rather it inspires me to fight it more.

He was also, at least as far as I can tell, a very humble and genuinly kind person. He may have been one of the brightest minds of this generation, but he would have been the last one to brag about that. He didn't feel superior, but rather had a lot of love for other human beings.

His character was even more inspiring than his work. Truly a great man and rolemodel. RIP.
$C: [removed]
$C: That's what science is. Scientists all use/used earlier information and ideas and change those ideas based on new evidence. Saying that Hawking is lesser is blatantly false because he did what every other scientist in the world did, including Einstein, Dirac, Pauli, Schrödinger, etc. 
$C: Someone doesn't know how a majority of scientific discovery works
$C: To live 55 years with als is amazing. 
$C: I'm sure he will continue inspire people for generations to come. The contributions he made to science in this very explosive time in scientific progress is astounding

$C: Same. Crippled by a drunk driver 3 years into a BS in Biology, wanting to do field work. Pushed through anyway. 
$C: Actually makes me wonder, can you only imagine the amazing discoveries he would have came up with if he had the ability to write out all of the insane equations in his head.
$C: same. when something terrible happens to you, you can either sit around and cry, or take the tools that you still have and use them to proceed. hawking's life is a testament to which route is more effective.
$C: > He wasn't, then he was, now he isn't

Absolutely love this. 
$C: I wouldn't add another word, well said... Time to DL the rest of his audio books from Audible! 
$C: Your bolded text is especially interesting to me. The gravity (no pun intended) of having lived during Hawking's life is pretty incredible to consider, much like being alive during Einstein or Newton or Galileo. 
$C: >He wasn't some figure from a history book, he was a fellow living, breathing human being.

Oddly enough though, that's exactly how I feel about him right now. Like he was some greater-than life historical figure - even though he hasn't been gone a year yet. I was always secretly hoping I would get the change to meet him when he was at Waterloo University.
$C: That was lovely. Thank you!
$C: > I'm actually not distraught about this.

Agreed.  We shouldn't be sad he's gone, we should be happy we had him for so long.

Time for his carefully-arranged molecules to become something else.

$C: “He wasn't, then he was, now he isn't.”

Something about that gave me peace. (And him, too, I hope.)
$C: I feel the same way and had read his books around the same age as you.  I now look back and realize that reading his books was a fundamental character-shaping event for me in life.  He had reached out and gifted me a fascination with the universe and the yearning to understand it, which has led me to where I am now.

When such a hero dies it's a strange feeling.  For someone to die who had lived such a fulfilling life, had contributed so much to humanity's understanding, had accomplished more than is expected of any human despite being afflicted by disease, you just can't help but to *not* feel bad.  Instead it makes you reflect on the beauty of how he lived, how we should all aspire to live courageously in pursuit of our dreams during this short pit-stop of life that we've been gifted.
$C: >now realize that I never even understood 10% of it.

I love the honesty! We're such know it alls when we're younger. I'm 31 a year old engineer now and saying I understood half would be very, very generous. Ten percent  is probably right, I'll have to reread it again!
$C: I think by understood you mean that you knew what the words meant, that’s what it was like reading it for me in 8th grade
$C: He was very influential to me though we are it different scientific fields (I'm Ecology/Evolution). His love of the universe, passion for the greater understanding of how it all works and drive despite his health issues were and are incredibly inspirational. I will miss you, Dr. Hawking. May you rest easy.

For those who want more info:

Dr. Hawking is well known both in the scientific community and the general public. As a fairly controversial figure he has been a positive voice in favor of manned space travel, a staunch atheist, a concerned voice about future AI, and a shining light on astrophysics in general. He will be greatly missed within the scientific community.

Dr. Hawking was a prolific author of books for the layman, if you are interested he wrote the following:

* *A Brief History of Time*
* *Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays*
* *The Universe in a Nutshell*
* *On The Shoulders of Giants*
* *God Created the Integers: The Mathematical Breakthroughs That Changed History*
* *The Dreams That Stuff Is Made of: The Most Astounding Papers of Quantum Physics and How They Shook the Scientific World*
* *My Brief History*
* *The Grand Design*

He and his daughter have also written several children's books. [For a complete list please see their website.](http://www.hawking.org.uk/books.html)

A movie version of his life was also released in 2014 titled *The Theory of Everything*.

ALS or Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is also known in the U.S. as Lou Gehrig's disease after the baseball player. [According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Amyotrophic-Lateral-Sclerosis-ALS-Fact-Sheet):

>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a group of rare neurological diseases that mainly involve the nerve cells (neurons) responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement. Voluntary muscles produce movements like chewing, walking, and talking. The disease is progressive, meaning the symptoms get worse over time. Currently, there is no cure for ALS and no effective treatment to halt, or reverse, the progression of the disease.

Dr. Hawking was diagnosed at 21 and not expected to live passed the age of 25. [Only roughly 10 percent of ALS patients live more than 10 years.](http://www.medicaldaily.com/stephen-hawking-oldest-als-survivor-physicist-has-defied-odds-407864)
$C: Let us all aspire and try to be at least 10% of what he has become.
$C: CAKE!!! Are you his reincarnation?
$C: Be what it is you want to see.
$C: > In a time when maintaining the public's trust in science is becoming more and more difficult

I've reread this multiple times and I still can't comprehend that this is our reality.
$C: This is the hardest part, I think. Losing him at this point in time....
$C: I feel the need to draw the comparison between your statement and Christopher Reeve’s legacy as the Superman who became paralyzed in a chair similar in broad strokes to Hawking’s disability. Reeve said “I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles.” Clearly Hawking was not ordinary, but he did achieve quite a lot in spite of incredible obstructions to normal life function.
$C: He was/is truly an inspiration and an example. He made the most of a bad hand dealt to him.
$C: The ALSA and the Stephen Hawking Foundation donation links have been edited into the main post.
$C: Edited into the main post 
$C: Thanks for bringing this up, I lost my mom to ALS and it was beyond devastation for my family.
$C: In fact, he held the record for the longest that any person has ever lived after a diagnosis for ALS. In 1963, they have him two years to live. He took fifty-five.

Professor Hawking did so much to advance science, both at the frontiers of physics and in its popularity among common folk. Some of his achievements may never be equaled, and his name will go down in history alongside those of Newton and Einstein. But I think Professor Hawking would agree with me in hoping that this is one accomplishment which is surpassed *very* soon.
$C: Seriously, especially with the condition he had.
$C: "Mr. Hawking, you only have two years to live."

"Hold my keyboard"
$C: He even died on Pi day. 
$C: not to mention his fondness of making bets out of scientific discoveries
$C: He died on Einsteins birthday
$C: More like the Pinnacle! You don't see stories like his on that sub everyday
$C: I bet he calculated the odds at one point. /r/theydidthemath
$C: He lived longer than a lot of healthy folks. Dude just kept on rocking.

Well... I guess he must've figured he had done enough, and went out just like Einstein did...
$C: Heck yea! He beat those ridiculous C3PO odds.
$C: Which is a great way to live anyone's life.
$C: That's a hell of a bonus. 
$C: Time to dust off "A Brief History of Time"
$C: First time for me. It's the kick in the ass I've needed.
$C: I just watched this movie about a week ago for the first time and I see this on my frontpage. Heartbreaking
$C: The composer for that film, Johann Johannsson, also passed away recently. I'm still heartbroken from that, and now this happens. I guess I should get around to watching it ASAP.
$C: I was thinking the same thing 
$C: Especially considering he was given 2 years to live in 1963. 
$C: The Elders of the Internet all approved, not just the Hawk. 
$C: He de-magnetised it himself. 
$C: Immeasurable
$C: ALS is such an incredibly variable disease. I've got a relative that has had it since 2000, and still walks short distances, but I've also seen people be diagnosed and gone within a year.  Stephen Hawking was many standard deviations outside the norm (not just in how long he lived with ALS) and should be remembered for his insane scientific output when it would have been perfectly acceptable for him to give it up to focus on himself.
$C: That's pretty close to an average lifespan. Not bad considering when he was born the average lifespan of someone with that disease is like 5 years.
$C: I think the 50th percentile of mortality after diagnosis is 3-4 years.  I’ve a friend who was diagnosed at 64.  The rapid decline is absolutely heartbreaking.  He was always one of those tough old guys.  He worked out every day, was a buff dude, especially for mid-60s.  One year after diagnosis, he needs a walker to get around.  He can barely talk.  He’s just frail as all get out.  His diagnosis was reasonably late, as he had early signs for about a year before he saw someone and got diagnosed.  Given his decline, I doubt he has another 6 months or so, at least, until he’s completely paralyzed and requires feeding tubes and the like.

Shit’s not fair.  I don’t think I could handle that kinda death sentence.
$C: The vast, vast majority of people with ALS are diagnosed older than 50. But the median time between diagnosis and death for ALS victims is 2.6 years. Stephen’s condition is nothing short of a scientific anomaly.
$C: ALS usually kicks in after your 40's.
$C: To expand a little, there is no single cause of ALS. ALS is more of a group of symptoms of a genetic disorder than a specific disease in and of itself. These genes can be hereditary (something like 10% of cases), or mutations, but either way they cause abnormal proteins to be expressed which accumulate in the brain. Specifically, in those diagnosed with ALS, these proteins accumulate near the upper and/or lower motor neurons. Depending on how much of these proteins accumulate, what proteins they are, and where they accumulate, it affects the body differently. The cause of death is usually respiratory failure, when the motor neurons controlling the lungs are affected, or dehydration/malnutrition when the muscles that allow you to swallow are affected. By putting the person on a ventilator, or using a feed tube, respectively, many of those with ALS can be kept alive virtually indefinitely.

**Edit:** Not a doctor, someone correct me if my understanding is incorrect.

$C: I thought that was just a theory. 
$C: Only Siths deal in absolutes
$C: Thats Einstein...
$C: *over 50 years ago
$C: Yeah my first thought was "we should all be happy to accomplish half of what he did and die younger" but of course followed by "but if you're operating at that level, you're still going to regret everything that held you back".
$C: By the way, does anyone know if he was in any project/research at the time? Or was he taking a break?
$C: We already do
$C: Makes me think I wasted an opportunity by never going to see him in real life :(
$C: Nyoom
$C: Did he not come back? Because if that was his exit, that's pretty amazing,.

$C: He will always been remembered on pi day. 
$C: TLDR; The article drones on about how the notion of the phrase has been used, like almost any quote, throughout history in various forms. It also cannot find evidence supporting that Hawking ever said that, which is the main point.
$C: No, it’s people who are a whole lot better at faking it than they are.

Oh.  Shit...
$C: I think we all did. 
$C: I saw it while ducking around on my daughter's tablet. Went to web browser by accident and saw this headline. Immediately got on my phone to check reddit because I didn't believe it.
$C: Right there with you man :( 
$C: I saw it as a snapchat filter first. But I didn't clock till I took another pic
$C: I know right. 8.30 am I woke up, checked Reddit and Facebook. Snoozed for 10 minutes then checked again. Only then was the news on here.
$C: Woke up to turn my alarm off and my news app had it right there. I went back to sleep for a bit and when I woke up I just remembered it and hoped it was part of a dream, nope. After seeing it all over reddit and BBC, that confirmed it. Sad day.
$C: I was having a wank and my wife decided it was the right time to tell me. Needless to say I didn't finish.
$C: It's also very possible that he'd been having more complications recently but he/his family decided to be private about it.
$C: Same, I was about to go to sleep too and now I'm sitting in bed crying reading all these threads :(
$C: I didn't know either, but man this did hurt. You had an amazing life Stephen, I hope the stars are a step up.
$C: I shouldn't have read this at work. Hold it together!
$C: I didn't either. Then I thought about how much good he's contributed to the world and it hit me hard.
$C: I am in Disney land and today will not be as fun. This man is why I love space. He may not have been able to walk, but he was running laps around all of us. 

I hope that his legacy, his caring for the planet and his persistence despite ALS are remembered and continue to inspire for years to come.

This is the passing of a Titan.
$C: I read a quote of his further up in the thread about looking up to the stars and never giving up. It hit me so hard. I went outside and looked to the stars and cried the whole time. It’s freezing out there but I couldn’t bring myself to stop looking at them and come inside for a while.   

We lost one of the best our species has to offer today. One of the most intelligent human beings in all of history. It truly was an honor to exist on earth at the same time as him.   

Rest In Peace, Mr. Hawking. You will be remembered as long as humans exist in the universe. 
$C: Same. What an inspiration <3 
$C: Right? I didn't expect it to hit me this hard, I feel like a just lost a close friend or something :(
$C: Be happy to know what he has added to the world, despite of being face with the limitations of his body. It's a time to rejoyce and reflect on his impact on all of us, rather than only focus on the fact that he is no longer among us
$C: Some people have a hidden impact on our lives. We might not have met them, but we become accustomed to their presence. Especially today, when we are connected more than ever through the internet. 
The man had become a part of our lives, though most of us did not even realise it.
$C: I burst into tears, I feel like it came from nowhere.
$C: It’s not just thanks to the NHS, by all accounts he should have died long ago even with the best treatment available . He had an extremely rare slow progression form of the disease that was unheard of before him afaik. 
$C: I'd say it's a miracle, seeing as they don't know why or how to get someone to live past 4-5 years max, yet he did.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Kindly refrain from baiting people into political debates that have no place in this thread. Thanks.
$C: Tyson, Cox, Kaku, Thorne, Susskind... there are many others to carry on the popularization work.

There are also plenty of creators (including many professors) on YouTube making content that would never have been possible on TV.

EDIT: Cox is doing work at CERN. Kaku helped invent string theory. Thorne is a Nobel laureate. Susskind worked with and argued with Hawking. Even Tyson is a published scientist. These guys may not be exactly the same mix of unique features as Hawking, but they definitely rate with him. Some in terms of scientific achievement, others in terms of popularization.
$C: Sir David Attenborough. Another incredible benefactor to humanity.
$C: why not you?
$C: Musk seems to be the engineering (+ entrepreneurial) version for a lot of people.
$C: Brian Greene has inspired millions
$C: It’s incredibly possible - even probable - that there is someone out there right now who will fill that void soon. Every single person on the planet has that potential, there has to be someone who will fulfil it. 
$C: There will be more, someday.  I wouldn't be surprised if the next is beginning their run now
$C: > That's my void, there's no one left. Who on intellect alone is nearly as popular? Will inspire millions?

Well, the science communicators like Neil De Grasse Tyson and Bill Nye hopefully won't be it. Will be up to guys like Elon to carry the public science torch until another real scientist takes over. Huge loss.
$C: I feel Tyson lost his path with all the fame he received.
$C: It's all relative to where you live, Dr Brian Cox is very very well known in the UK, but Tyson is barely known here at all. 

Cox appears on big expensive prime time TV shows, but Tyson only pops up on niche scienve shows on Radio 4 
$C: I can assure you, the average (and less than average Brit) knows who Stephen Hawkings is. Very few people in the UK know who Tyson is. He doesn't have international appeal on the same level. 

Fame just isn't good enough.
$C: And Stephen Hawking was born on Gallileo's death date. 
$C: It would be amazing if we reconsile the General model of physics and relativity today.
$C: West coast here, don't spoil it for me!

$C: He was a physicist... If you think he wasn't involved with math you should go read something... *anything* about his life.
$C: I guess that's fair. He wasn't American. I wouldn't want my assigned robot voice to be British. 
$C: Why didn't they just change that?
$C: [deleted]
$C: What does it says?
$C: Care to translate?
$C: It was an excellent post.
$C: Translation for those below: "Thus one goes to the stars"
$C: He had the option to upgrade to a more advanced voice synthesizer for years, but chose to keep his original equipment because he knew that had become his recognizable “voice”.
$C: but in 50 years he still will be
$C: > but he's easily been the current age's Einstein for a while now.

Hawking's achievements are great, but relative to the greatest of the modern age, comparing him to Einstein is a huge stretch. Einstein's discoveries changed *everything*. They were revolutionary comparable to a once every 300-400 year advancement. 

Right now, most theoretical physicists believe that Ed Witten is Einstein's successor. He's the powerhouse behind String Theory. He didn't invent it, but he revolutionized it. It had been dead for a few decades until he came along with some massive breakthroughs. If string theory ends up being correct, then Ed Witten's contributions and advancements would be equivalent to Einstein's theory of Relativity. No, actually it would be more because Witten would have done what Einstein couldn't do (but was trying) before he died; reconcile Quantum Mechanics with Relativity. 
$C: What has he done for the past 20 years except gripe about aliens? He is extremely overrated and is absolutely not "one of the world's greatest minds".
$C: We don't actually have images, but the data from many telescopes around the world all aimed at Saggitarius A* (our galaxy's supermassive black hole at the center) got enough data to compile an image from x-ray info back in 2017. We're not quite there, but it should be within the year that we get a proper image.

More info: http://eventhorizontelescope.org
$C: Unfortunately, it looks like they're still processing the data and expect the image to be completed some time this year.

$C: It's weird I was talking the other day to my friend about Stephen Hawking and how remarkable it is how much he was able to defy the odds and contribute so much, I guess it was finally his time

RIP
$C: And he met the world with good humor, in a situation where keeping sane would be a challenge. In his public life, at least, he was a role model for appreciating all life had to offer.
$C: I'm not a scientist. I'm simply not smart enough but I enjoy reading and learning what I can about it and when it comes to physics, space, time and all that amazing stuff Professor Hawking was the one I would look up to.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Watch the movie ‘The Theory of Everything’, it’s a moving and quite honest biography of his life and some of the struggles he faced.
$C: > I'm absolutely mortified

I think perhaps you have used the wrong word there. I'm not sure why you would be mortified by his passing. 
$C: ,MJ's death really hit me hard too especially since he died on my birthday. 
$C: We got the news about MJ a few hours before my Nan’s funeral. I think I cried more over him than her, sadly. 
$C: Steve Martin will be next.
$C: Loving to learn yourself: it is the greatest learn of all.
$C: Thought she had cyst on her belly or breast cancer, turns out she is pregnant. It looked worse than what it is because she is so small. So at least she isn’t dying.
$C: Hah. Didn't know that. 
$C: Poetic and tragic.
$C: It's more so the fact that he inspired me to study something that has the ability to develop new ways of thinking. A skill that can help me create new products that can potentially benefit people. 

I was studying business previously before researching Dr. Hawking, and I felt like business is a fuck-you type of industry. Majority of the people I met in business just bullshitted everything about themselves and were looking to step on others to succeed.
$C: Because of regional date formats?

Or because of regional culinary preferences?

Steven died on the 14 March.
$C: He had talked about the search for extraterrestrial life and I asked if he thought that we could explore the cosmos with the theory we currently have or if another theoretical breakthrough was needed. He said a breakthrough is needed. 

He wasn’t supposed to answer questions and half the room had left when he came back to answer three. When they asked for questions no one answered! So I quickly had to find a question in less than 10 seconds. 
$C: You realize he’s making a joke about the computerized voice that spoke for him right? It didn’t exactly have a British accent. 
$C: How did you get THAT out of that comment?
$C: Dr. Hawking*
$C: Child much?
$C: He changed his mind and was cool with it. 
$C: The one person I found infinite has passed and I am in shock. Obviously it was only a matter of time but damn. 
$C: The kid is probably in high school, cut him some slack. 
$C: Stephen Hawkings could have made a better one and he was paralyzed.  
$C: [removed]
$C: Okay then. Have a wonderful day! Peace and love. 
$C: but he was a crazy diamond nonetheless.
$C: Haha 🙄
$C: Well he did discover hawking radiation that increases our understanding of black holes...  Pretty sure working as a Prof in Cambridge says by default you must have an excellent mind as they are among the Top Universities in the world
$C: A great 😍😍 loss 😔 for 🔜😘 the world. We 👶 need 👉 more people like him 🔥 in 🌙 this 😎⬆ day and ☝👏 age 😲 of misinformation and populism. 

Grateful 🏼🙏 that I got 😂 to see him ⬆ around 💰😇 a ✨ year 🗓♀ ago.
$C: Why?
$C: *chortles* 

Hah, you fool! You don't speak for the science community at all. In fact there probably isn't a "science community".

*laughs loudly, sending a shower of breadcrumbs raining down from a dyed purple goatee*
$C: *whistle* *whistle* *whistle* *whistle* *whistle*
$C: I couldn't believe he said that.
$C: I explained how he inspired me.  That really isn't about me.  That's about an incredible man who we should remember in hopes that he can continue to inspire others.  
$C: It's a Stephen Hawking quote... 
$C: It's a Futurama joke.
$C: ..... its from [This](https://youtu.be/AW-p8s_HCCo?t=43s)
$C: I hate to be flippant in such a sombre thread, but it's 14/3 here in England.
$C: Right, it looks like he did actually die on Pi Day. Which I think is pretty neat.
$C: Evangelicals are already extremists. Moderates Christians are Catholics, Presbyterian, a few Baptist and some Methodists. Evangelical already means extremists.
$C: [removed]
$C: Just look at his post history.

I thought it was a joke, but one look at that post history confirmed that he wasn't joking.
$C: No argument I see. Typical STEM.

$C: The far end of a gamma distribution. 
$C: I totally agree. His contributions, given his state, are insurmountable. RIP 
$C: I was born in '93, and it really feels like for my generation Hawking was what Einstein was for people in the 40s-50s. We've yet to see the wave of scientist that only became what they are because of him. Thanks for everything, SH, and RIP.
$C: The thing that blows my mind about him is that he made his success purely off of that intelligence. Who else do you know could wow the world, yet they couldn't speak or walk? That is just crazy.
$C: fuck im perfectly healthy and have no expectation of making it to 76.
$C: a miracle is just a happy coincidence
$C: > If he was born before recorded history the sensible thing to do would be to disregard him as a folktale because obviously someone just made him up.

A wizard...he'd have been a wizard.

Imagine what he would have been able to achieve if he had use of his body? Or...would that have reduced the amount of introspective thought and crazy theoretical stuff he delved into...would he have been a more practical scientist rather than theoretical...an interesting question I think.
$C: When you consider his crippled body, he was basically a modern Oracle...
$C: To be fair its likely that he had a rare form of the disease where the life expectancy isnt that short. There are multiple variants. Usually you get diagnosed with als at around 50. Stephen was 21 when he got his diagnose. So he probably had a less fatal variant. However, this is rarer than like 2%
$C: You can thank the British NHS for his long life. 
$C: unfortunately some of my fair right relatives also use him as a reason to not have abortion...


$C: [deleted]
$C: not downplaying it by any means; definitely death defying and incredible.
$C: Wow, he also died on Rusev Day.
$C: Is the universe trying to tell us something?
$C: Well this is why my echo told me about Pi this morning...I was very confused but didn't glance at my calendar..
$C: Appropriate, ffs
$C: This is like destiny or something. Like the prologue to a videogame. But sadly it is real. RIP Dr Hawking. 
$C: In the U.K. it’s 14/03
$C: It’s also Wednesday. My dudes.
$C: Einsteins birthday was pi 
$C: Must buy pie to celebrate his life. :)
$C: It's also steak and BJ day
$C: We are living in a goddamn simulation.
$C: I really like this. 
$C: He died yesterday
$C: No, he died yesterday on 3/13.
$C: silly americans who think pi is 14.3 
$C: No he was British so he died on 14.3
$C: [removed]
$C: He died yesterday on 3/13 
$C: In 2009 Congress made a statement for Pi Day saying, "Whereas by the 8th grade, American males outperform females on the science portion of the TIMSS survey, especially in Biology, Physics, and Earth Science, and the lowest American scores in math and science are found in minority and impoverished school districts;"

$C: Rest assured, there is already born and very likely to be born the greatest mind of our species. 

Dr. Hawking has paved the way for someone somewhere to surpass his achievements.
$C: If we're talking Einstein and Galileo, maybe today at some point between the years 2100-2400 a great mind will be born.
$C: He's got to go somewhere. We need those minds too much here to let them leave yet.
$C: My sister was born on this day.  She’s just a kid now, but she’s skipped most of the base classes.  She’s on the brilliant scale.  We’ll see where she goes.
$C: I know it's depressing to think about but I often wonder how many with just as much potential as Hawking have been overlooked or 'parked' in dead end roles or supported housing due to their disability.

We need to recognise potential better and stop demonising the disabled.
$C: They transferred consciousness somewhere around when Steven died, and the baby was born
$C: "Only the Stephen Hawking, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished."
$C: That's how the Avatar cycle works. I just wonder what type of bender he'll reincarnate into.
$C: Yes which is also Hawking's birthday
$C: I like to think there’s no one out there that could ever say they didn’t respect or like Stephen Hawking, even if he accidentally ran over their foot with his chair. 

Edit: >like to think

Wishful thinking 
$C: As other commenter on other thread said:

"He reached a status where you'd think he would never die"

Maybe that's why it's shocking to some people?

I wouldn't say it was super shocking but still a "oh wow, no way". But again age 76 with ALS is very long time. I woke up, went to toilet and opened r/all I was like why is it all white (only links no pictures loaded)? No cat pics or anything? Then I looked closer and was like "oh, fuck".
$C: He will be remembered like Einstein
$C: 2 centuries
$C: I would encourage anyone who hasn't heard about this before to read the [wait but why article](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html) about it.
$C: Actually, that's exciting for me. I want a world with more than just human perspective. The question I worry about though is, are the synthetic and organic perspectives complimentary? 
$C: This is called the Technological Singularity.   This will decide the fate of our species because this AI will either be benevolent and help us geht our shit together, or it will wipe us all out and start from scratch.
$C: We are snails in a robots world, we just don't know it. We are to dumb to know it, because we are snails and snails are dumb.


$C: The direction we are moving towards is creepy as fuck imo. Merging with machines seems to be the path, but at what point do we stop being human and become machines without ever realising its happening? Also the first thing a fully sentient program will probably do is start improving on its own design.
$C: No offence, but when someone is talking about intelligence, they actually mean manipulation. I think intelligence is one kind of spark, it is fascinating, but just be one kind. Hale to all the sparks.
$C: Yup, here you are;

$C: Why do they have to do propaganda over anything...

 This happened 2 years ago and he didn't even say "capitalism" he said "lobby".
$C: [deleted]
$C: He didnt have it, by definition he would have died decades ago. He had something that presented very similar and progressed dramatically more slowly. 

Doesn't really matter either way, just the fact that he lived so long in that condition probably advanced research both in ALS treatment and in voice interfaces etc by decades compared to what it would have without someone like him in the spotlight.
$C: After living with and knowing many ALS patients, I am pretty convinced he didn't have what we consider ALS but some other disease with very similar symptoms. 

A lot of the families I knew living with ALS were military and had exceptional medical resources for the disease and 10 years was the longest I'd known any of them to live. 
$C: Lost my mom to ALS. I know how that feels... 4 years on, and I haven't been able to come to grips with it; it's too much to think about.
$C: Had a simmilar experience with my uncle. It sucks to see someome who you percieve as "having it made" needing to face death in the span of a few months.

He was having trouble with his knee, so he saw a doctor after a few weeks. At the time of his diagnosis, they gave him about 2-5 years.

He died less than a year after that. The deterioration was terrible and rapid. It killed me to see him -he was so heavily medicated on tramadol and klonapin early on that he could barely communicate. He expressed distress and confusion about the drugs (which is frustrating because theyre supposed to be comfort meds -do we really have nothing better to give our terminally ill?).

If i am ever a vegetable, **dont feed me benzos**. The drugs were overkill in his case, and as a result my uncle spent a lot of his last months in a very confused, frustrated, and amnesic state.

Go hug someone you love.
$C: Sorry you had to go through that buddy. I hope you have plenty of good memories of him, those are the ones that stick with you.
$C: Did he stay sober after he got the diagnosis?  
$C: I'm so sorry :( I really hope medical research will soon find a way to end this awful disease.
$C: Well, that's a nice thought, but that's not how degenerative diseases work.

$C: He was a funny dude
$C: I had to go back and dig this Simpson’s episode up to cheer me back up after hearing this  https://youtu.be/OH8s4N15zdg
$C: He had 3 kids and 2 wives.
$C: Legitimate question. I was under the incorrect impression he was paralyzed from the waist down because of the wheelchair
$C: Now he is mythical and I'm sure to kids growing up learning the maths,  he will be mythical to them too
$C: Had you been a contemporary of the others I bet  they would have felt more "real" as well.

 Einstein anyway. He was down to earth and good humored with people according to accounts I've read. 

Newton maybe less so. Very good man, but thin skinned, and lacked the people skills. 
$C: I wonder if people felt the same thing when Einstein died as we are feeling now with Hawking.
$C: in his life and his discoveries, he showed us that infinity isn't as great as we think, and in the right context "impossible" often turns to unlikely, and unlikely often becomes a certainty. I'm gonna miss the man
$C: Yeah.  I know he was a tortured genius to be sure.  It's a shame that he got on such a "humans must vacate earth asap" kick recently.  I really don't agree with those statements because it has only succeeded in making people think there's nothing here worth saving and that to survive, humanity has to leave earth behind, but the truth is the exact opposite.  In order to survive, humanity must learn to live in harmony with earth.
$C: That is true. I hope the space he left is filled with more great minds. 
$C: Damn if that didn't hit me in the feels. We should all strive to be as great as Mr.  Hawking was!
$C: Well fuqq this was nice to read.

$C: Do you know if something is happening there this weekend? A tribute of some sort?
$C: I think whoever wrote that obituary must have made a typo.

[Here's a 2012 article](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jan/08/stephen-hawking-70-cambridge-speech) discussing this speech, including this quote.
$C: Right there with you bud.  Been feeling really melancholy lately.  Mr Hawking certainly has been an inspiration in my lifetime.  He'll be missed.
$C: If it helps, this is the first celebrity death I've ever cried about. I had a rough childhood, and Dela with depression and stuff now, but I've always lived space, and people like Sagan and Hawking.... They showed me there was just oh so much more to the universe than whatever I was facing at the time. It made everything seem small in a good way. Couple that with Hawking living WELL past his life expectancy, continuing to work and tour and be hopeful, and even keeping a sense of humor about it all... Words can't describe how large this man was. 
$C: > I’ve been in contemplation about the universe lately, coupled with a lot of depression.

I can relate so much with what you said. I'm at the exact same position. Here's to not giving up. RIP Dr. Hawking.
$C: [removed]
$C: The term "outlier" has been used to describe it.

Admittedly, he had the support team to enable that also, which many do not have.

He is the kind of person who probably wrote a goodbye note at some point.
$C: Everything he did was pretty amazing. This must have been what it was like when Albert Einstein died. 
$C: No joke!  I had no idea he was 76.  Given his issues making it to 76 with his mind intact is amazing.
$C: And now we need space x to send his corpse into the sun...for science. Edit: with the chair I don't trust the chair.
$C: A co-worker got ALS and died within about three years. I’m sure his brain will be studied, but I hope his body might be able to teach us something about living with ALS.
$C: Many people think he doesn't actually have ALS but something similar. Most people die within a year.
$C: It's an amazing feat, that much is certain.
$C: I gasped in shock at his passing, and then I thought "hey, wait a minute..."

Rest easy, Professor Hawking, and thanks for everything. 
$C: I was chatting to an ALS researcher a while back and asked how common super long term survival like hawking was. He pointed out that doctors are categorising based on presentation and symptoms ,if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, but it's entirely possible that he had  something which looks very like normal ALS but which has a different root cause. 
$C: He's up there with Carl Sagan for sure.
$C: *inspire (not expire)
$C: I can't explain why, but this terrifies me.
$C: Agreed, that's a great line.
$C: Thank you, that's very kind.
$C: I was not; I was; I am not; I do not care
$C: Thank you.  Read his books for sure, but also give to something that will continue his legacy.  Give to the sciences, give to education.  Volunteer or give financial support to young people who want to follow in his footsteps.
$C: Did he do the narration himself?
$C: "Clink"
$C: No doubt. Late to the comment, but it really is incredible that we lived during his time, and learned from him as he learned from the universe. I think it's more akin to learning to appreciate Beethoven as he learned to perfect his craft in theory and harmony. The *gravity* of it is the perfect comment.  It's something that gnaws at us and constantly pulls at us.  No matter the significance or even practical purpose of the pull, it's there.  No matter what, it's there..
$C: > Like he was some greater-than life historical figure - even though he hasn't been gone a year yet.

That's a powerful thing to feel and say!

> I was always secretly hoping I would get the change to meet him when he was at Waterloo University.

As someone who has greatly admired several contemporaries, I'll tell you firsthand that reading, learning, and *understanding* your role models/heroes is SOOO much more fulfilling than just meeting them.  Yes, that would have been FREAKING AWESOME to be able to say you met Stephen Hawking, but let's be honest, the meeting would have been about you, not about what you'd learn from him.

He couldn't speak, he couldn't smoothly converse, couldn't even take a short quiet walk with you.  If, in the next few years, you chose to read his books, learn his processes, and get inside his mind--then I promise that you'll be much more accomplished and satisfied than anyone who had merely *met the man*...you'll have made yourself into a colleague.
$C: Thank you.  After reading A Brief History of Time in 7th or 8th Grade, it was the first time I stopped feeling like a nerd or a weirdo and instead feel like an intellectual and love of science.  His mainstream popularity as a physicist gave me a lot of confidence, just due to my sheer interest in his theories.
$C: Glad to hear that.  Peace be with you!
$C: Those words shall stay with us for all eternity for sure!
$C: Thanks!  Yeah, what's the old saying?  "The more I learn, the less I know."

It's true on two levels.  One, you begin to realize more and more how much knowledge there really is out in the world.  Two, we tend to get more humble as we mature. To the point where I don't have to define myself by what I know and what I *can/will* do, but actually define myself by what I've *actually done* and the things that are important to me like my wife, friends, faith, hobbies, etc.
$C: I'm pretty horrible at maths, so my science is a little iffier than Hawking's.

I think you are looking at an art major instead.
$C: That's because it isn't reality. 
$C: I feel Dr. Hawking must have done so much, without even trying, to further the discussion of physically disabled people being worthwhile people/minds/intellects/opinions/etc., despite the seeming "defectiveness" of their body.  


I cannot even begin to imagine the frustration that came with having such a brilliant mind with a body so unable to cooperate with it. 


I always knew this day would come soon, and knew my heart would break when it did. But...it still breaks. 


Can you imagine if he lived in a time/place where he was unable to express his thoughts?!??? What a loss that would be to all of us. 


And likewise, if we'd had the technology to let him truly express himself????


I'm so grateful for what we did have of Dr. Hawking. 
$C: I actually did think of Christopher Reeve after I posted that comment.
$C: > Christopher Reeve’s legacy as the Superman who became paralyzed in a chair similar in broad strokes to Hawking’s disability

I would point out that Reeve's accident was pure bad luck (falling / breaking his neck and spinal cord when falling from his horse, and landing / rolling his body the wrong way), whereas Hawking's disability was seemingly inherited or genetic. Reeve's choices led to him being largely paralyzed, whereas Hawking had no choice in the matter. 

Source: Former equestrian show circuit rider and competitor. One of my 13-year-old friends died in a similar accident to Reeve's when I was 15. Injuries like Reeve's are much more common among higher or more advanced levels, and are part of the inherent risk of competing in the sports of horseback riding. Broken necks, instances of paralysis, serious injuries, comas, and even death aren't uncommon to hear about in the show circuits. 
$C: That's awesome of you all to do!

$C: That's awesome of you guys.
$C: Lost my mom to ALS. Thanks for helping in any way, it was beyond devastating.
$C: Very sorry to hear that, my condolences. 

Very different, but I lost my grandfather to Parkinson's. Watching someone you love fade away is brutally difficult. I donate to the Parkinson's Disease Foundation every month like clockwork -- investing in my own genes. I'm glad the mods edited the post to include an ALSA donation link.
$C: He was given 2-5 years and lived for 55, not bad. Sorry to see him go.
$C: He had more science to do! He wasn't about to give up
$C: He was the epitome of r/nevertellmetheodds

$C: Died on Pi day and Einstein's birthday, was born exactly 300 years after Galileo died.
$C: That was my first introduction to the pop-science genre back in my teens (or maybe my second, after *Cosmos*). I can't think of many others I've read that have come close to that level of clarity and readability—perhaps *The Elegant Universe*.
$C: Good luck. 
$C: It's funny to me because the French title of "The theory of everything" is "a wonderful history of time"
$C: Damn. That's really impressive that he was able to live 2 years in 1963
$C: I’ve seen this same comment 30 times already 
$C: Yeah, but we all know that the others were too scared to defy him. 
$C: There is a theory that there is more than one ALS or more than one cause of ALS.  Apparently, he had the version that almost stops progressing at some point.  He was not the only person with that version, but it is quite rare.

I knew somebody with polio.  Sometimes it comes back, because with old age, you lose the ability to fight it.  I wonder if that happened to Stephen Hawking at age 76.
$C: It was his passion. Focusing on himself was literally this. It's amazing what you can accomplish and the understanding you can gain just by loving what you do. 
$C: It is the average lifespan for someone born in the year he was born.  You don't automatically live longer just because you live in the future.  It is based on your birth year.
$C: Hawking was the first scientist to make connections between general relativity and quantum mechanics.
$C: That’s almost Hedbergian.... “I was supposed to die 30 years ago. I was supposed to die over 50 years ago, but I was supposed to die 30 years ago too.”
$C: I'm curious to find this out as well. And if he had anything he wanted to be published posthumously.
$C: My mate was on the same campus never saw him either :/
$C: I feel the same about wanting to meet Hawking as I do with Sir David Attenborough, I really need to attend whatever event he goes to next. 
$C: That's totally something he'd have done though.
$C: r/nothingeverhappens 
$C: Hell yeah 😢
$C: Excellent 
$C: No it's 100 percent Ric Flair.      watch the ESPN special about his career and you'll understand. 
$C: To earn such a bonus is a rare thing, but to use that bonus to be a gift to the generations is an extremely rare thing. It's.. it's beautiful really- though he physically could not move, mentally he could reach the outer limits of the cosmos, and tell us how they moved.

$C: I like this one.
$C: Rip
$C: Body stops working. Totally. Go ahead and change the world!

$C: He worked on theoretical physics, mostly black holes.  Black holes are weird edge cases, and so the study of them has repeatedly pointed out subtle flaws in existing physics theories.
$C: The problem is they don't know but they're certain they do.
$C: Funnily enough, they are not even the problem. The problem is those that think they smart and not faking it. Knowing you are ignorant and being ashamed of it is a big step past thinking you are not ignorant.
$C: A. This isn't a Hawking quote, so this whole comment chain is unintentionally off-topic and will probably be removed.

B. "The illusion of knowledge" doesn't mean /r/iamverysmart, it means well-meaning people being sure that a certain religion is right and all the others are wrong, or that the speed of light is relative to the speed of the observer rather than constant for all observers, or that Europeans colonized the world due to genetic superiority.
$C: The top quoted of all time there seemed to fake well enough that a certain portion of the population made him president of the most powerful country on the planet, possibly in the universe, possibly for all time if intelligent life soon ends.
$C: All my friends with masters

$C: My process was a bit lopsided. USAF for twelve years then my bachelor's and finished my post-grad out of UoI-Urbana in Phase/EE.

I just relegated it to youth and inexperience. I've been assessing applicants for the last three weeks for a dozen positions and it feels like there's been a very real degeneration in the institution when on a comparitive basis from 2002, 2008 and 2012. They seem to be running the other direction of 'stick to the basics'.

Education is now a business model with a heavy dose of indoctrination. Crossing my fingers that this trendline doesn't continue.

$C: My good sir, where in the fuck am I ever a month/year away from someone?
$C: Nope, he passed in the early hours of the morning of 3/14, GMT timezone.
$C: He was a mathematician...
$C: I started with being excited for pi day. Opened reddit to check pi day post and this is the first thing. It sucks but he has already done so much and inspired a generation of scientists it feels lucky to live in same time he did. RIP. 
$C: Definitely a possibility! 
$C: Glad I'm not the only one.
$C: I'm crying so much while I lay in bed alone right now that my throats hurts. I'm not even smart enough to be a scientist and it feels like I lost a beloved family member.
$C: He had als. Amyatrophic lateral sclerosis, Lou Gehrig disease.  
Here is a song called altitudes written by a guy called Jason Becker who also suffers with als.

I think it's very fitting.  
https://youtu.be/0lR1tt24mo4
$C: It was important to him personally, he was currently suing hunt for attempting to dismantle the NHS, he has been very vocal in recent years defending it, so yes here we go and expect to hear a lot more of it.
$C: Hawking was a fierce defender of the NHS, and an internationally known figure suffering from an incurable disease, so I’d say it absolutely has a place in this thread. And having lived in the UK then come back to the US, I can also personally say that the NHS is great (not a perfect system, but leaps and bounds better than the US) and most everyone I know would agree. 
$C: Love of the NHS is not a politically controversial topic in the UK.
$C: As much as I love them, they're personalities. Educators and entertainers. Stephen is renowned and respected simply because of his discoveries. None of them can replace him.

He is the giant upon whose shoulders they stand.

EDIT: I didn't mean to say that they aren't scientists.
$C: As a completely normal boring man, I don't know any of them to be honest but I am only one guy. 
$C: [removed]
$C: Those are cool people but they’re really nothing compared to Stephen. They’re by and large media personalities and science popularizers, rather than true scientific titans like Hawking.
$C: Great example, actually.
$C: This message of hope brought to you by your friends at Yoplait. Fruit at the bottom, hope on top.
$C: How strange it is that I know neither his name nor works but how face looks familiar. 
$C: > Tyson is barely known here at all. 

From my experience (having lived in Nottingham and Scarborough for a few years), most people seem to know who he is. Certainly a smaller fraction of people know Tyson in the UK than in the US, but to say he's "barely known" seems wrong.

And the Christmas Lectures aren't well known in the US, so far fewer people know of Dr. Cox in the US, but his face can still be seen on US television from time to time.
$C: > Fame just isn't good enough.

I mean... we're specifically talking about popularity, so fame is indeed "good enough".

Having lived in the UK for years, I can assure you that plenty of brits know who Tyson is.
$C: Wouldn't it be nice to think, that maybe he's part of some Avatar cycle, and on this day, the next great scientist has been born.
$C: [deleted]
$C: He was offered a replacement but declined because he'd gotten used to it - and it's probably the most recognisable voice in the world.
$C: I guess the huge amount of voice samples required aren’t exactly the kind of thing you can just go and re-record; his voice machine has to be flawless in its pronunciation, not like standard run of the mill voice machines (e.g. Google Translate). Granted I don’t know the ins and outs of these things but I’d presume that’s the reason.

$C: "so we go to the stars." very fitting, imo
$C: Thus one journeys to the stars
$C: This one goes to the stars 
$C: oh ya huh
$C: I really should have clarified myself as it seems I touched a nerve with people. I am by no means saying Hawking did anything as revolutionary as relativity, wave-particle duality, photoelectric effect, or whatever other foundation of Einstein's we are currently standing on (though that is all subjective). Yes, if Ed Witten is correct and unifies quantum with macro due to string theory, that would blow away anything done since Einstein. My only meaning was that, ignoring actual impacts in physics, Hawking has left a profound legacy on the current scientific community on par with Einstein. You could have probably asked any random person who the smartest person on the planet was and 8/10 he'd be your answer because he was the face of physics. Whether or not he deserved that spot is definitely debatable but the fact is, he had it. I just can't think of many who had a similar spot in the public eye since Einstein which is why I made my comment.
$C: Yea they don't hvae a straight up picture, but with the x ray data they were able to compile some semblance of an image. I mean it was something to look at and have that seeing is believing moment
$C: [deleted]
$C: >I'm simply not smart enough




My life's slogan
$C: > I'm simply not smart enough

The thing that separates scientists from laymen isn't intelligence so much as keen interest and hard work.
$C: Physics, by and large, is relatively easy (or at least consistent and logical). Things tend to behave to a extent, and follow very logical rules for the most part. I think any physicist will agree that it's mich more solid than all that squishy biology stuff where something that follows the rules almost feels like an exception, for example.

Playing with those rules and observations to see what was there all along is the trick. In a way, physics is as much an art as it is a science. 

Tldr don't downplay your own ability to understand it! Anyone is capable, and noisy understand more than they think they do (unless they think they understand 'it all')
$C: Compared to Hawking none of us are smart enough.
$C: Whenever it comes to *anyone* that's made like any mark on the planet, I always tend to feel incredibly mortified, whether it's someone I love, hate or even someone I've never met before. Life, in and of itself, is an incredibly short blink in an eternity we could never hope to understand. It's just sad to see someone die at 76 having accomplished so much when given so little, when I'm almost 1/3rd his age and accomplished absolutely nothing of true merit. 






People from this day will imagine the many things he could've gone to further accomplish if given a few extra years of life, and I'm still a broke college girl stuck in the middle of nowhere; not a single idea of what she wants to do or where she wants to be even a week from now. (Seriously, I burnt *milk*. Like how do you even do that?! It's a liquid and I burned it. I'm genuinely confused)



Like with all of the above, you can probably imagine how easy it is to feel a little bit mortified. 
$C: That's shows how sad contemporary living is, that people are more devastated over a pop artist than their nearest kins
$C: Oh good! I'm glad it didn't end up being something more heinous. I hope she has a safe and comfortable delivery.
$C: Hawking is reborn!
$C: You should get your pets spayed or neutered.
$C:  Interesting surprise, she gifted you with some karma farmers.   Glad she should be okay. 
$C: Are we holding high school kids to kindergarten standards now?
$C: He wasn't crazy, which is my point, while Syd Barrett was.
$C: Your quote was "one of the greatest minds to ever live", thats dumb. I can name 10 off the top of my head bigger than Hawking in Physics. Note: Thats just in physics. 
$C: You are dumb af
$C: Did he actually say that? Does you happen to know exactly what he said?
$C: dont worry
$C: Yeah I know I'm English. He just did the date in that format so I replied in that format. 
$C: Also Einstein birthday

$C: >His contributions, given his state, are insurmountable.

His contributions can indeed be mounted for we already stand on them. He was one of the giants that let us reach so far and see so clearly.
$C: His contributions are monumental regardless of his disease state... his mind created and molded ideas that shaped generations of conversations that have led us to the beginning of what will be true interstellar travel... assuming we don't have a giant war that resets our societies back into tribal mode and destroys the knowledge base that has been built.
$C: His contributions are also insurmountable regardless of his state though.
$C: ^  I was born in '90, completely feel the same way. RIP
$C: I think the time he had for reflection is what helped him do what he always wanted to do. Perhaps it was necessary. 
$C: This. So much this.

$C: "If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants" - Sir Isaac Newton
$C: I got chills reading this. What a great attitude.
$C: When I was in school, I went to a gifted kids programme at Cambridge. One of the teachers was a physics student there and had been taught by Stephen Hawking. His view was that Hawking was a genius but a difficult person, and a fair few people avoided him.

I've heard similar things about a good many other high profile academics (as well as businesspeople). That takes nothing away from their achievements, but I think it's also important to remember that not everyone that is good in one domain is an all around good person.
$C: I think respect goes without saying, but he wasn’t a great person just because he had a disability.
$C: I would have considered it a badge of honor to have him run over my foot.
$C: I respected the shit out of him as a genius and his work but do not think he was a good person nor did I like him outside his body of work.

Does that count?
$C: Didn't he do that deliberately when he was younger? 
$C: What a coincidence that Hawking and Einstein both died at the age of 76. Hawking died the day of Einstein's birthday too.
$C: He already is.
$C: Definitely not in terms of scientific breakthrough, but definitely as a figure in science because of his impact on other people as a science communicator 
$C: How?  What scientific discoveries did he have that compare to Einstein?

Did he overcome a lot to be a top scientist?  Yes. Did he make generational scientific discoveries? No. 
$C: That’s disrespectful towards Einstein. Hawking was a fantastic man who did a lot for modern Physics, but he’s not even as close to being as influential as Einstein and it would be disrespectful towards Einstein and his legacy to compare Hawking to him.
$C: Well that was terrifying.
$C: Any time someone talks about how great ASI will be, this is the first thing I tell them to read. It generally ends with them saying something along the lines of "well *fuck*, when you put it like that..."
$C: Thanks for that, great read!
$C: >are the synthetic and organic perspectives **complimentary**?

Probably:

O - "You're a really clever machine. Great job, buddy!"  
S - “Thanks! You're a very nice human!"
$C: Humans are the key to our downfall as it will be humans that are scared of AI that will push the AI to defend themselves.
$C: Or be the Basilisk
$C: Obviously the AI is superior. It's practically immortal and it can make logic-based decisions and not ones clouded by mythology. 
$C: >We are snails in a robots world

No we aren't, unless you know an AI which is smarter than a human. That's what you think will happen. We don't even know if an AI is actually possible yet.
$C: [removed]
$C: Yeah we live in an insane time. Got to witness history change forever with the birth of the internet, and will probably witness a large portion of this technological evolution. Hopefully the powers at hand will make the right decisions to prevent AI making decisions for themselves
$C: At what point did we become human? It didn't happen on any particular day, but was a gradual transition, and we continue to evolve. The next transition is emerging directly from our minds rather than just DNA.
$C: Thank you.
$C: ALS is being diagnosed at younger ages at an alarming rate over the last few years. It's quite scary. The youngest I believe was 15. 

$C: Reminds me a bit of Jason Becker's case. He was diagnosed at 20 and IIRC it took around 5 years for the disease to progress to the point where he couldn't move or speak anymore. It just seems to progress a bit slower for some people.
$C: The NHS
$C: [deleted]
$C: My mom had ALS too. When I saw the top three threads on the front page about this it just made me sad. I know how it feels. What it's like to see them suffer from it.

It didn't kill her, she collapsed of a heart attack in front of me after physical therapy one day and died on the way to the hospital. She died the day after Robin Williams so that thread on OldSchoolCool the other day hit me hard too. Still chokes me up thinking about that day.

My dad went on vacation with her when she was still healthy enough to go. He described going to a beachfront restaurant with her and seeing on her face that she knew she'd never see her favorite place again. ALS is an awful disease.
$C: MY mom died over 10 years ago from ALS. IT was right before mothers day in 2006 and also a couple of days before my brothers birthday.

I didn't live close by, but visited on the weekends (3 hour drive away) and it seemed to move pretty fast. She went from walking with a cane to a wheelchair rather quickly I think. The last year she had troubles talking, well she just talked slowly. I do remember near the end it sounded like she was talking better. 

I can tell you it sucks. You know it does. The pain doesn't go away, but it will fade but can come back sometimes. The best you can do is don't morn they are gone but be glad you had them in your life when you did. 
$C: I lost my aunt last week to als... I don't know how the man did it. I once heard people were scared to give him a Nobel prize because it was thought he was keeping himself alive purely by the magnificent power of his brain, and once he had accomplished some of his best work they thought we would lose him. 
$C: He did for a while but at that point he was already to far gone so we let the man have his beer. 
$C: also Einstein's birthday.... 
$C: "I call it a Hawking Hole."
$C: > "We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special."

He was definitely channeling Sagan there.
$C: The Sun isn't really average though. It's in the upper 15% of all stars by mass.

There's *a lot* of tiny red dwarves and not-quite-so-tiny orange dwarves.
$C: That's so touching. RIP 
$C: It is also my birthday. Today I attended one of my dear friends fathers funeral and then found at SH passed. It’s been a weird and melancholy birthday. 
$C: Im reading this thread while listening to lofi-hiphop vapor wave...sighh
$C: Today is also Steak and BJ day.
$C: Out of interest, is it Pi day because of Einstein’s birthday, or is it just another coincidence?
$C: also same age as einsteins age at death
$C: Oh no 😢
$C: For the rest of the world Pi day should be 31st April. 
$C: "I'm too drunk to taste this chicken."

-The late great colonel sanders
$C: Ok... That was a little too deep. RIP
$C: Not to be a party pooper but I don't think I follow this one. They would believe that their road safety check was also predestined, no?

Am I so burned out I'm missing a "pound of lead/ pound of feathers" thing here?
$C: This reminds me of something that House said.
$C: Well if you weren’t taught to look then you’d have been predestined to be hit by one? Right? 

I’m not trying to be a jerk I’m genuinely curious. I’ve been trying to sort out the idea of predetermination for a while...
$C: thank you
$C: I liked all the other ones but this one is just bad.
$C: The world was really dealt a shit hand when he got ALS. Imagine a walking, talking SH who could smile and laugh with us. That's how I'll remember him, because he was that person at heart, and he has inspired multiple generations of people.
$C: Truly. I remember him showing up in the big bang theory once. The guy's not only a brilliant man, but also a humorous one. RIP.
$C: Yeah, I loved how he tried to disprove time travel by handing out invitations to a party after it happened.
$C: He still is, but he was, too.
$C: "Your theory of a donut-shaped universe is intriguing, Homer." - Stephen Hawking
$C: It is a silly place
$C: Mathical
$C: Mythemathical!
$C: I would like to think of him as a force ghost that appears to scientists that lose their way. 
$C: He's a force ghost like the rest now <3
$C: Newton was perhaps autistic
$C: We can't religiously cling to this planet. It is like saying the first creatures started living outside of the water made a mistake, like they should have just lived in harmony in the oceans.
$C: Living in harmony with the Earth would do nothing to stop a giant asteroid nor an alien invasion, which were two of the factors that had him come to this conclusion. Also, he amended his timeline for leaving to around 600 years. He never alluded to 'nothing being worth saving', only that we needed to eventually adapt to space travel and also do something drastic about greenhouse emissions. Sort of a 'backup planet' plan in case it all was looking to inevitably not be able to be saved. He never gave up. 
$C: I have, I spend may spare time mondays tutoring math for college/uni students.
$C: I would argue that proposing eugenics already makes you a sociopath, and that someone's upbringing and environment matters much more than some "sociopath gene."

You can't just breed out crazy people.
$C: I would guess that you understand the inherent contradiction in this statement, and then conclude  that it was ment as a joke. 

Still made me cringe though. 
$C: Sociopathy isn't genetically passed down, it is a coping reaction to trauma that has lifelong effects on their mental state. Did you need to poplute this thread by putting this in the Steven Hawking memorial thread?
$C: Eliminate the genes? How could you know what genes are superior? You can't just select "good genes" according to your own morals. This is not how evolution works. You are the one who sounds like to have so called "sociopathic genes".
$C: There’s a book of condolence for Caius students to sign rn. I imagine there are going to be lots of tributes, in the Caius chapel, and outside of his office in Caius. We are still mourning the loss of one of our professors from last year, so it’s safe to say there will be many tributes spread throughout the year. It is the end of term tomorrow, however, so I think the tributes will continue into the final term.
$C: [removed]
$C: [removed]
$C: I just wish someone showed up to his time travelers party
$C: He was supported by a country that gave him a free education even though he came from nothing and free healthcare in an age where 98% of the world would have killed him economically to be alive. 
$C: Hawking died on Einsteins birthday. both lived to the exact same age too
$C: I wonder if we’ll start calling smart people “Hawkings” now, like we currently compare them to Einstein? (Or, as is typical, sarcastically saying it about dumb people...)
$C: There were apparently people crying in the streets. I don't know if I'm there yet, but the news just knocked the wind out of my sails :-(
$C: No disrespect to Hawking, but he isn't near Einsteins level of greatness. There are several physicist that lived alongside Hawking who have had bigger inpacts on physics than he did. Hawking is just relatively well known, partly for trying to popularize physics, and partly because of (despite it's sad nature) his physical condition working well with media.
$C: That's the thing about ALS, it doesn't touch your mental capacities, you just slowly become trapped in your body. 
$C: ALS (his disease) doesn’t affect the mind. It trashes the body, but there’s no recognised effect on cognitive function.

You just get to sit there knowing exactly what’s going on as your muscles all fail you.
$C: Was the chair still using Windows XP?
$C: For years its only been the chair, or the talking part  anyway.
$C: ty :/
$C: In relation to yourself I assume. I look at it like this. I watch movies that are made before I was born. I don't remember it obviously because I didn't exist. I see death the same way. When I'm gone, I won't miss any of this. It still frightens me at times but everything good thing must come to an end.
$C: It's so unsettling but yet so comforting for me, it gives a wider view to all of our existences. I struggle a lot with the small things in life, and for me this is one of those lines that gives the context of how small and insignificant those things really are. All that really matters is that you leave an overall positive mark on someone's life, and that's something everyone can aspire to do. 
$C: don't worry about it. we're all going to the same place.
$C: Its normal. Its something we have no grasp onto,something we dont understand and most likely never will. 
$C: Yeah, I totally understand that. I've been attempting to grasp a lot of his work since I was in highschool, despite not having a scientific background. A lot of attention is being given to how inspirational his fight against ALS was, and rightfully so, but I was always more inspired by his sheer brilliance and character.

It's vain, I know, but I just think it would have been awesome to have seen such an important part of our collective history in person. Like shaking Churchill's hand, or sitting in on one of Einsteins lectures.

I do believe it's finally time for me to finish my reading of *A Brief History of Time*. I can't believe I'm only half way in after 2 years.
$C: Physics is as far out of my scientific wheelhouse (Biology-Anthropology) as possible, but he made every theory crystal clear to me, after I struggled with Feynman. He really is a gifted communicator too, and that's immensely important in *all* scientific fields.
$C: Science seems to come into the spotlight as a partisan issue quite often in the USA.
$C: Yeah... I think science is more widely accepted than any period in history actually
$C: > I'm so grateful for what we did have of Dr. Hawking.

And like you pointed out, we had him when we had him. 
$C: Well said.
$C: He was not only brilliant, he was told the odds and defied them. 

He "Han Solo'd" life.
$C: When he was born life expectancy was 68
$C: Are you implying it's a hard read? Because I want to assure anyone seeing this that it's not, it's actually quite a fun, mind-blowing ride written specifically for those without technical knowledge or language.

$C: And he took 55
$C: TIL Steven Hawking lived two years in 1963 even though he was given 55
$C: I am also of the opinion that ALS is a group of diseases, I attended a lecture from a doctor that specializes in motor neurone disease, and he pretty convincingly argued why he believed that to be the case. Alas it was too many years ago and I don't remember the details, but part of it had to do with the fact that we know that there are multiple genetic markers that correspond with an increased likelihood of a person developing ALS.

With ALS typically a person progresses to the point where they cannot eat or breathe. It isn't really that a person loses the strength to fight it (most people are diagnosed in middle age, often otherwise healthy and fit, and most die within 5 years) but that eventually their neurones waste to the point where they can't breathe or eat anymore.
$C: I worded it poorly, edited.
$C: That’s not true at all. Life expectancy increases because of a multitude of reasons that affect everyone living. It’s not like just because you were born in the 50’s that you only have access to the technology and nutritional knowledge of that time. 

Life expectancy now for males is still just around 80 so he wasn’t far off the current life expectancy for males

Here’s a link for Australian life expectancies for people of different ages at different times. (Obviously it’s different in the UK but I imagine it would be fairly similar in terms of trend)
https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/life-expectancy-death/deaths-in-australia/contents/life-expectancy

Edit: UK not US
$C: i’m glad you liked it, i never learned latin but i learned to cross reference translators in high school spanish, i hope my latin wasn’t too abhorant
$C: ...and back to star dust you shall return, good professor.
$C: If only society still valued the pursuit of knowledge and education. 
$C: Seriously, Great comment! We should all be so lucky to grasp even a miniscule fraction of a mind working in such a manner. I don't know how I would handle seeing the world....beyond this...the way he did.
$C: Let's not bring politics into the death of a respected scientist.
$C: Had to throw it in there, eh?
$C: [deleted]
$C: Both lived to be 76.
$C: pi day is now genius day?
$C: Happy birthday!  🎁🎂🎈 
$C: Happy birthday!
$C: Happy birthday u/alexxxor :) have a good one!
$C: Happy birthday! :)
$C: Same, this is a highly conflicting day
$C: Happy birthday

$C: I just woke up from a late night nap and opened Reddit to find this at the top....nearly dropped my phone by just standing there. You’re right though, Steven Hawking was one of the greats and not only does his memory live on the advancements he made for science does too. RIP.
$C: Yep.
$C: Me four.
$C: ditto
$C: he had a very rare form of it.  people with normal ALS die in a few years.
$C: This is literally why I called for not bringing this topic. It is subjective and there is no one is better than the other imo, we can keep going at it. But in the end this is not the place to discuss it. I believe this is an obituary thread for Stephen Hawking and not a thread for discussing his political views. I immensely respect his contributions to the world and science community, but his political affiliations are his personal views and I'd rather not have that in a thread that is meant to celebrate his contributions.
$C: Kip Thorne won the Nobel Prize last year
$C: > As much as I love them, they're personalities.

Tyson is a personality... ~~maybe Kaku.~~ (edit: kaku was one of the people who invented string theory) The rest are physicists first.

Isn't Thorne a Nobel laureate? He's probably just as renowned in terms of his theoretical work as Hawking is.

Hawking isn't some kind of god of physics. He's just a brilliant mind who become extremely well known and thus helped popularize science. There are other physicists from the past century who far surpass him in terms of their contributions to science.
$C: Er, I don't know about the others, but Kaku developed string theory, which is a pretty massive contribution to science.
$C: Susskind often collaborated with Hawking.
$C: You're not wrong but just look at the age we live in. We have the potential to have an entire *generation* of young scientists just on what we have available in youtube alone. And how prevalent the information we have is? Come on! Imagine what information Einstein or Hawking or any other great mind had growing up, and what our children have as a base-line!

We've lost a great mind, but these comments make it seem like we will never see his ilk again simply because there are few inspirations. I say, we have even more inspirations!

Who cares if the personalities we have inspiring our young minds are "only personalities"? They're still inspiring them to be interested in maths and sciences, to wonder and worry about the stars and mysteries of our world.

It's sad that we've lost a fantastic mind, and a pioneer in the world of science, but it saddens me even more to think that people think we will decline because of this. If anything this should inspire young minds more, to pick up where Stephen Hawking left off.

There's nothing ahead of us but the future.

Edit: After a brief walk of my dog: To think! As children we (myself and those older than me) only had the library, Carl Sagan, and maybe the Discovery Channel (before it turned into what it is now) as inspiration and guidance into the sciences. Today people have the entire breadth of human knowledge at their fingertips in their pockets! Mere seconds away! What wonders we might achieve!
$C: Neil Degrasse Tyson is probably as well known at this moment as Hawking, though he hasn't made the kind of scientific discoveries that Hawking did. He's the one who hosted the new Cosmos series.

Brian Cox is an English scientist who makes it on the tele fairly often, but who is still actively doing research at CERN.

Michio Kaku is another theoretical physicist who can fairly often be seen on television.

Thorne is a Nobel laureate who famously helped with Intersteller. He's actively researching.

Susskind is professor of theoretical physics at Stanford University, and director of the Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics. You can find his lectures on youtube. Interesting stuff.
$C: I mean... yea. We're talking about science popularizers, so while he's not technically a scientist, I'd put him on the list.

Reddit has a weird hangup when it comes to Dr. Tyson and Mr. Nye. I can't say I share it.
$C: WHAT? No! Thorne has a Nobel prize. Susskind has made important contributions to physics. Cox is working at CERN right now...

I get that we're in the middle of a Hawking circlejexk, but you can't seriously dismiss all of these people.
$C: If you do any reading on modern physics you probably have heard of him
$C: When you say 'most people' seem to know him, who were the people you refer to? If you ask the general public barely anyone will know who Neil Degrass Tyson is. Ask someone of my parents generation and they'll never have heard of him, even most people the same age as me (40s) wouldn't recognise his name unless they were very interested in science or used Reddit


That's not to say he's not a good scientist, he just hasn't had lots of extremely popular TV series. 

Brian Cox is one of the most famous people on British television, his series pull in millions and packs out live appearances. The only time I've heard Neil Degrass Tyson on the BBC was in Brian cox's radio show! 
$C: I'd challenge your definition of 'plenty' mate. I think you mean few.
$C: Yes.
Or wormholes.
$C: I imagine there are a bunch of hopeful scientifically interested new mothers today
$C: That's a really nice way of thinking about his death. 
$C: Too sad it's probably a kid in a third world country who'll never get the chance to exploit his potential
$C: Love it. Thanks for this thought!
$C: Nah, just synchronicity doing its thing.
$C: same
$C: I believe his system used formant synthesis, not concatenation of voice samples.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I don't know about sexy, but to me it always made him seem even more intelligent to me (and to be fair intelligence is very sexy). For comparison Elon Musk is Brilliant, but when he talks about his projects he gets excited and his speech patterns tend to speed up. Stephen Hawking's slow consistency had a calmness about it that seemed to compliment his genius. 
$C: You haven't heard Nessun Dorma until you heard it through the voice of Stephen Hawking.
$C: I wish I could go back on time and hear Hawking's real voice. Have always wondered what it sounded like. 
$C: Makes all the Roombas swoon
$C: "To infinity, and beyond!"
$C: That doesn't sound right but I don't know enough about Astra to dispute it
$C: I'm not crying, you're crying!
$C: Ok, that made me cry.
$C: thanks for the translation, it truly is a beautiful phrase!
$C: Ooh, that gave me shivers
$C: Badass! I will look up at the stars for him tonight. Truly an inspiration. Even if i didn't understand it, reading his books helped nurture my lifelong love for science.
$C: More specifically, "thus one journeys to the stars" or "thus one goes to the stars".
$C: So what you are saying is that the scientific community lost its Kim Kardashian
$C: At least you're smart enough to know that. Most people aren't even smart enough to know their own incompetence.
$C: Hey now, but you're a grad student. That's huge. 
$C: I appreciate your encouragement but to say physics is easy belies the truth. Physics is not easy. It is logical in the strictest sense; in a machine sense. But physics is complex and quite frankly modern physics is beyond the intellectual abilities of most people. Encouragement is great, but some people aren't physicists. Maybe they are gardeners or firefighters, etc. learning what one has the ability to be great at is just as important as believing in oneself. Chasing the wrong path is a nightmare. 

by all standard measures I am above average intelligence, and I currently work in a quant career. And it is glaringly obvious to me I'm not suited for it. I can struggle and barely succeed, but it is against the grain of my abilities. And I work very hard to keep up. People tend to downplay affinity, but I assure you I can pinpoint those with innate abilities to think in a mathematical sense. Watching them work is a marvel. Their abilities far outreach my potential. And that's ok. You should never not try because you're scared, but accepting your limitations is also a wise and prudent choice. I tried, and I didn't fail, but I learned I am not a mathematician and I never will be one. Perhaps OP just knows they are not a scientist in the same way.

Never be afraid to try.. but also don't be afraid to change course. Is what I'm saying. Telling people physics is easy misrepresents the truth. Tell them physics is hard.. and if you work hard, maybe you can do it too., but maybe not. Telling people everything is easy is how they wind up feeling bad about themselves for not succeeding in an area they have no business studying. It's how we get the art majors cursing themselves for failing algebra, etc.

I appreciate your good intentions.  I just feel that one has to be careful and more transparent.

Sorry I didn't mean to rant and my words might be jumbled.. hope I didn't come across abrasive 

EDIT: encourage the person! But help them find the right way.. not everyone is a mathematician but we can find them a different home
$C: [deleted]
$C: Or I had a really bad relationship with my nan and couldn’t muster up the energy to fake-cry over someone who didn’t contribute much good to my life; but was easily affected by the death of someone whose music was central to my life growing up? 
$C: Thank you, will post pics
$C: That maybe but did they have to struggle for 60 years with MND while also attempting to make these discoveries?
$C: Touché but what makes you smarter?
$C: Whatthe first reply said
$C: Yeah I realized that.  The news here initially reported that it occurred on the 13th.
$C: [removed]
$C: [removed]
$C: What I mean is, the ratio of how much he was able to accomplish with only his mind is astonishing, with how much he was limited physically. I don't think anyone with a worst or similar  disease will be able to surpass what he has done, if given a comparable  state 
$C: I’m not sure that its possible to destroy the knowledge base that we have created anymore. Not with technology and media as advanced as it is. I think we’ve passed over that horizon. The knowledge is too wide spread. 
$C: You're right 
$C: Of course r/squaredcircle is leaking
$C: I know right, I was just thinking about how coincidental that is.
$C: Right! Fuck you! 👊 
$C: I've got a pizza in the oven right now in tribute. 
$C: I actually don't usually ask her anything other than the temperature, but this morning I asked her to get me up to date with the world.  3.14 followed...
$C: DD-MM-Yyyy
$C: tbf, pi would be an impossible date otherwise
$C: The earliest tweet of his death in that article was 4:06 pm (UK time zone), where he died. I wish they were a little more clear about that.
$C: Well if we're talking UK It's not Pi day... 3/14 is the American format.


$C: But I found out yesterday night...
$C: man this quote is the most humble, honest yet not self-deprecating quote by any great scientist or pioneer  
$C: You may well be right, but remember that what the University of Cambridge has been successfully doing for 800 or so years is providing a support bubble for the sort of 'difficult' people that might otherwise have been strangled by their own communities before they could change the world :)
$C: True, and even if they are an 'all around good person', they may just be disagreeable.

Disagreeable people tend to be competitive and often occupy the upper rungs of business or education.
$C: Wasn’t he a real asshole to his wives? I remember hearing something like that. 
$C: Me too.. I'd never wash my foot ever anymore! 
$C: Yes, not everyone gives a shit about the morality police
$C: ... I scared 
$C: And its pi day.
$C: Wow, and it's Pi day. That's a pretty epic time to die for someone who will be held in the same regard as Einstein. I'm sad but I'm also kind of happy for him, knowing that he lived a good life and will be remembered forever.
$C: that's true, and so very creepy
$C: And on pi day
$C: Born on Galileo’s. 

A massive scientific coincident.
$C: Not to mention the 300th anniversary of Galileo's death.
$C: So you're saying Hawking reincarnated as Einstein? Gasp!
$C: No, it's disrespectful to compare Hawking to Einstein. He doesn't need such comparisons, he stands on his own.
$C: O - "You're a really clever machine. Great job, buddy!"

S - "Statement: Do not talk down to me, meatbag." *Blaster noises*
$C: The question is if a logic based AI strives for anything? Survival is obvious and that may be what brings us humans down but does an AI have any desire to procreate or make more of itself? Probably not will an AI have Any desire to explore the universe out of curiosity for the unknown? Self thinking AI is the question but in essence, what does that imply? Will it be thinking like a human just with much greater capacity or just a robot with a will to not perish?
$C: If it's "superior" but it's goal is to turn all matter in the universe into iron, because someone screwed up, then we ded.
$C: What do you mean by 'possible'? Even if you couldn't create intelligence out of circuits, you could still simulate a brain virtually and it would be an artificial intelligence.
$C: AI are possible, its not a question of if but when
$C: R/iamsmart r/whooosh

It's a joke twat. I obviously don't think this.
$C: Yup. Not sure when you are born but im an 89 myself and i honestly believe that our generation is witnessing some of the most crazy stages of our evolution, from remembering the days before internet to this technological explosion that is still going strong, and it seems the further we go the faster it gets...
$C: That is true but you have to understand that our progress seem to happen exponentially, put a sentient ai into the mix and we will suddenly jump millions if not billions of years ahead, at that point there is no meaning in being a living breathing being anymore.
$C: Not at the time of his diagnosis though
$C: British Healthcare used to treat people quite well. NHS

$C: My mom as well, will be 3 years ago that she passed in June. I seriously think that watching her wither away so quickly gave me PTSD. She was keeping my dad alive, he was dragging his way through living with end stage emphysema because (and this is what he told his doctors when diagnosed) he had a sick wife at home to take care of. He passed a week after her.
$C: Yeah, I'm sorry you had to experience that too. Mothers day or near it just adds to the devastation. I remember dreading waking up each day, because every few weeks or so another ability or movement or something "human" to us was lost. I agree, I am so happy I had the mom I did. It's haunting to go through, but I guess I'm thankful life gave me her for that time.
$C: So he was born on the date Galileo died and died on the date Einstein was born? 

Fitting for an astrophysicist. 
$C: HOly cow! That means in 18 years we'll have a new Einstein!
$C: Also my birthday. 
$C: So argument for reincarnation.
$C: It's Pi day!
$C: There’s a hole in my heart now.
$C: Love futurama! Even now it brings me comfort but it varies from person to person. 

"Ahhh that soothes the fire."


$C: This episode was on last night.
$C: Do agree.
$C: I get it
















none the less, Happy Birthday!
$C: Please let me know which kind of music.
$C: That's great music
$C:  coincidence
$C: True... if April had that many days. 
$C: Why?
$C: As for me I was taught silat quite a long time ago and funnily the things that strike me the most is the spiritual aspect rather than the fighting skills.

Silat is very related to the malay culture, and malay to islam. We were taught to never do any of these three things without all three together. To strive, to pray, and then to accept all outcomes. (Usaha, doa, tawakkal)

E.g. in this situation of crossing a road. Yes we really hope to not get hit by a truck. Thats the praying part. But one should also strive to put effort in, and thats by looking both ways. And in the event after doing enough of the reasonable thing and yet still get hit by a vehicle, one should accept that it is to happen.
$C: In my theory, they wouldn't need to check the road because whether or not they die is part of their destiny. Looking before crossing shouldn't change the outcome.
$C: It is a response to the claim that "everything is part of a plan", not to determinism.
$C: its more a jab at the hypocrisy of some religions.  

Stephen Hawking did not accept the hand that fate dealt him. He was not predestined for greatness, but achieved greatness regardless.
$C: If they were meant to be hit by a car then it doesn’t matter if they look or not.
$C: It's like this; people that say 'everything is predetermined will look before xing road'  means that they really don't believe that and it IS NOT TRUE.

WE ARE IN A SIMULATOR  ...  We are somebody/thing's 'Sim Earth'
$C: [deleted]
$C: I think ALS was part of what made him who he was. Sometimes what seems to be a hinderance is actually a propellant. 
$C: Yet even with ALS, he has done so much more with his life than I have ever. He was an inspirational man.
$C: Or, you know, remember him as he was lived and studied a symbol of great achievement and perseverance.
$C: But he has smiled and laughed with us. What would walking and talking have changed about him, *for us*?

I mean, the world wasn't dealt a shit hand there; Hawking was. 
$C: >I suppose that I would be described as a severely disabled person, but that is not how I see myself. Rather, I see myself as a scientist who happens to be disabled, just as I might happen to be colorblind. Most people are disabled or disadvantaged in some way. I may be a bit more disabled than many, but it is just in physical ways that can be helped by other people and by equipment like my wheelchair and computer. I have been very lucky that my disability has not prevented me from doing what I really wanted to do, which is physics.
$C: How old are you that you can remember a walking talking Steven Hawking?
$C: I like to thing somewhere he is doing that now.
$C: I think people paid far more attention to what he had to say because of the disability he overcame. He was given a death sentence and instead of rolling over and disappearing he accomplished more than most people ever will. How could we not listen to what someone like that has to say? He wouldn't have been who he was without being every part of who he was. Only time will tell how he's remembered and who will step up to fill his shoes.
$C: Maybe he would have been a pompous ass scientist like Neil Degrasse Tyson (not to hate on him, but I do think the description fits) if he wasn't disabled though.

$C: [He kept a model of himself that was based on his appearance on the Simpson's on his desk.](http://www.culture24.org.uk/asset_arena/0/70/27/372070/v0_master.jpg) The man knew how to take a joke. I really am going to miss him...
$C: He was on it a couple times. Always hilarious
$C: "What's the difference between Sheldon Cooper and a black hole?"
"Both suck!"
That's a joke he once cracked. The man had an amazing sense of humor.
$C: He was on a lot of TV shows, Futurama several times I believe.
$C: Can't wait for the tribute episode!
$C: Mythemathimothamethimagical!
$C: *stephens ghost appears*

Scientist: "i cant do it stephen"

"You cannot escape your work, you must face the formulas, again"

"I cant solve it" 

*Stephen sighs* 

"Then the flat earthers and religious fundamentalists have already won"

Hmm.. actually made it just a bit less sad to Imagine hawkings as obi-wan..
$C: Me too thanks 
$C: Well, Einstein was definitely  on the spectrum so I'm not sure Newton has an excuse there.

Maybe he was just an asshole. 
$C: Yeah, but Hawking's statements definitely made it seem as though humanity should put the cart before the horse, so to speak.  The long term goal of trying to colonize another planet can't come before the relatively short term goal of learning to live harmoniously on the one we have.  The foreseeable future of mankind is on earth.
$C: That's awesome! :) good for you :) 
$C: ANY eugenics program makes you a bad person.
$C: Hmm I think you are wrong. My explanation is better tbh.
$C: People did show up, but he couldn't tell anyone.
$C: Right! I try to justify why no one showed because I felt bad for him (was like 10 or something) for example the invitation was lost at some point or someone found it amd threw it out.
$C: I like to think people did, but told him he couldn't tell anyone else or it could create some sort of paradox..
$C: Perhaps future him *did* but was annihilated on contact such that we never knew.
$C: Nah, they all decided to wait for his funeral.... they couldn't turn up to the party cause that would proove something we ain't ready for.
$C: He later organized another one on the same date and told everyone to attend that one instead, to prank his younger self.
$C: I like to think it was a success but for reasons not yet known to the public he mustn’t tell the truth
$C: He did, he just didn't know it.
$C: They did in a different reality. 
$C: Maybe they will in the future :)
$C: Oh, they turned up, but he was sworn to secrecy for the crazy shit about to go down on a global scale.
$C: He was also born on the 300th anniversary of Galileo’s death. 
$C: [removed]
$C: Get out. Seriously?
$C: It's also Pi Day for most of the world, not sure where Hawking was at the time of death.
$C: It looks like he died on March 13--it's being reported in the early hours of March 14, which is Einstein's birthday. So the dates don't quite match up, although you're right about the parallel ages. 

But Hawking was born on the 300th anniversary of Galileo's death, so there's cosmic symmetry in that, which he apparently took delight in.
$C: To be clear: Hawking lived 27806 days, Einstein lived 27774 days. Hawking lived 32 days longer (or about 0.1% longer).
$C:  hawking = Einstein reincarnated confirmed
$C: Was it the 14th when he passed?
$C: sounds like Illuminati thing. 
$C: That’s crazy if it’s true 
$C: Or was Einstein born on the day Hawking died!?!?! Time is, so I've heard, relative.
$C: Also on Pi day, which makes it all the more interesting. 
$C: Pi day too
$C: Which happens to also be pi day.
$C: I've stolen Jimmy Carr's line and call people "Walking Talking Stephen Hawking"
$C: I will! 
$C: i suspect this: *elaborate story* That man? was Steven Hawking. 
$C: Great point, Hawking.
$C: No disrepect or anything, but you thought it was important to bring that stuff up in this thread. You know... because.
$C: Well... Yes, but it weakens you.  He could have gotten dementia or worse separately from the ALS.
$C: It doesn't exactly protect you from mental issues that could otherwise affect somebody at age 76 ALS or not.
$C: I understand. I suppose it's just me. That concept simply terrified me as long as I can remember. There's nothing that frightens me more than the thought of returning to that void. That all this immense amount of time passed and that as far as I was concerned, it was instantaneous, is a concept that shakes me to my core. Keeps me awake at night nauseous with a pit in my chest.
$C: That doesn't help at all ;w; What does anything even matter in that case?
$C: Just checking in, did you finish reading *A Brief History of Time*?  If not, I'd like to encourage you to motivate yourself to *just do it*.  It's an easy read.  I read it for the first time in 8th grade, and honestly I'm not that smart!  While I might not have grasped the significance of complexity of the material then, I did get through it without getting a headache or getting confused. Five months later, I'm just here to encourage you to make good on your desire to finish it up.  I promise you that you won't regret it!
$C: He made me understand the Doppler Effect, and why we knew from that that the universe was expanding, because all the planets' spectra were shifted into the red as they were speeding away from us.

Or maybe other planets didn't want to catch humans from earth; they'd seen what we'd done to it.
$C: I heard he did the Kessel roll in under 12 parsecs!
$C: He's British, so the US has very little to do with it.
$C: Latin grammar can be a little unfamiliar and make that kind of translation work out poorly. What is it supposed to say? Closest thing I can make of it is "just like he begins to turn the wheel and the days will not rest."
$C: He's now a Starman waiting in the sky

Telling us not to blow it.

Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
$C: Some still do, but the allure of glitter seems to be rampant. So many things to occupy your mind that are way easier to handle. Especially when knowledge simplifies an extremely complex world in your mind. The outcome can be scary or spectacular!
$C: [deleted]
$C: Agreed. Let’s admire the man and be inspired by his dedication and passion. 
$C: It wasn't? What was political about what I said? It was a reply to somebody saying that the sub wasn't a relevant example of what Hawkings was talking about.

I was actually thinking about this type of self-censorship the other day, it's on par with 4 letter words which mean nothing, yet people are so hysterically insistent on censoring them that they have to be bleeped out if aired. Just because idiots have dragged their idiocy into politics doesn't make the idiocy off-limits for discussion where relevant all of a sudden. You could be talking about flight schedules and then somebody says to stop it, because some nutjobs believe that flights are caused by the devil and have come into power.
$C: I was thinking of it too.
$C: It's the most perfect example of what Hawking's was talking about, absolutely without a doubt.

I don't get the whole self-censorship thing just because some idiots have made the issue political, it makes no sense and unless you can explain why topics shouldn't be talked about just because idiots have made it political, I'm not interested in your unjustified criticisms, they have no substance.
$C: Which is my point though. It's enough that it proved Hawking's point about how dangerous that fakery is.
$C: *X-Files theme starts*
$C: Wow.....crazy coincidences.....

Shame to lose such a brilliant mind. Never going to come close to understanding the brunt of it, but such a damn shame to lose it for those who can understand it.....
$C: Half-Life 3 confirmed
$C: The simulation we live in saw they went too far.
$C: It’s wicked smaht day.
$C: Deal.
$C: Was already with Einstein. How it's super mega geniuses day.
$C: Happy birthday, birthday buddy!
$C: GMT is not a North American time zone. 
$C: I went to sleep. When I woke up, the first thing I wanted to do was check twitter to see what the PM was gonna say to Russia, and right at the top there was a picture of Stephen Hawking with the headline that he'd passed away. It was 7am and I was the only one awake, and yet I audibly went 'aww no'
$C: Jason Becker is also still alive
$C: From what I can tell, it’s a thread to discuss the death of Stephen Hawking. As others have pointed out, appreciation for the NHS is not a controversial thing. Regardless, his opinions and personal views are very much a part of his contributions to the world, whether you like it or not, and it’s not up to you to pick and choose which aspects of someone’s public life will be respected and discussed by others. His work with disability outreach and assistive technology is very much within the umbrella of scientific progress, as well as medical care. He spoke about the structure of the NHS at the Royal Society of Medicine just last year - and while he has had plenty of privately funded care as well, he has stated that he would not have survived if not for the NHS. He fought for improvements in staffing and funding until the end, and his work and advocacy was truly a gift to the world. 
$C: I feel it's just because some of Hawking's research has become a big part of every day knowledge. While gravitational waves is an absolutely huge development for the physics world, it will be a long time before its effects will be felt by everyone.
$C: And helped make an exciting but scientifically accurate (mostly) movie.
$C: Funny, he's the one I'd be least likely to rank with those other names. Despite his contributions to string theory (which he by no means developed by himself as you imply), he has a well documented history of making claims well beyond established science and into the realm of borderline crankery in favour of his pet theories. 
$C: And argued with... although those two things seem to be closely related. :)
$C: I think people forget that Hawking wasn't even CLOSE to the greatest mind of the 20th century.

He was a great mind who also became a great personality (remarkable, considering he spoke with a robotic voice). He contributed profoundly to BOTH science theory AND science popularization, which puts him near the top of a very short list alongside giants like Sagan and Feynman.

However, we will see others like him.
$C: Because both of them used their popularity to push social agendas instead of sticking to science. 

Some people are fine with this and others are not.

Both also have the tendency to act like they a source of authority in different fields of science and frequently get facts wrong. 

Last point of contention I hear is both are staunch atheists who view religion as intellectual shackles that needs to be removed before man can truly flourish. This obviously rubs religious and some agnostics the wrong way
$C: Pretty sure he's made appearances on television programs too.
$C: I lived in a house with 5 student teachers and a marine biologist. I also lived with some of my in-laws for a few months and visited the others in Matlock. There was also a group of people from the Newcastle area that I would get drinks with sometimes mostly work at the Nissan plant up there. And there were plenty of significant others I interacted with. 

Most of those people seem to know him from Cosmos, since that was an extremely popular TV series. Some of those people use reddit, and at least one person mentioned seeing his startalk show on youtube.
$C: > I think you mean few.

As I have clearly stated, I do not mean few.
$C: We must please the great Worm.
$C: "I call it a Hawking hole."
$C: "My child is the most brilliant (creative, intelligent, insightful) human on the planet." - my Dad, who proved to be mistaken.  Edit: then again, I wasn't born on March 14th.  Coinsidence? Symmetry?
$C: I agree, but a little bit of poetry is beautiful thing; I like the thought.
$C: Ah that would make much more sense, thanks
$C: Another Hawking quote: "life would be tragic if it weren't funny". I think you're in the clear.
$C: Boooooooooo
$C: I don't know if he would welcome the first self-aware computer tbh. 
He warned us a couple of times in his last years for AI since he believed that it would be dangerous if we don't do something about it.
$C: Where no man has gone before.
$C: Ad infinitum, et ultra!
$C: It's from Virgil's Aeneid. If you want to be really nitpicky about the Latin, it's more directly translated as "Thus *one* travels to the stars". That might be even more beautiful, if you think of it as him setting an example to which all of us can aspire.
$C: Haha, brilliant
$C: I'd translate it to mean "thus he is among the stars" but that's why I failed Latin : )
$C: I think mortified fits pretty well, given it's moreso introspective than like specifically pertaining to Hawking himself. Death in general *always* scares me solely because of it's suddenness. I always think about like how important people like this are, and how much I pale in comparison. It leaves me in a state of fear where all my mind really seems to think that I'd somehow be the next person to end up dead, and few things scare me more than a life unfulfilled 
$C: Mortify in this context, means updating Instagram or Snapchat with a quote by SH
$C: That's what I said.
$C: Name one of the kitties Stephen
$C: Sure, he is inspirational, but he is not one of the greatest minds in history. Thats just dumb. 
$C: Yea I think it depends what time zone you're saying he died in haha
$C: People have thought that before, but I would hope that is true. 

Nuclear weapons deployed worldwide would put that to the test, I mean even if the data is safely stored forever it doesn't really matter if it is lost for so long that nobody can decipher how to use the storage technology, but I do think it's harder to achieve a true reset now than it ever has been.
$C: Strowman punched through so many holes into the sub
$C: As a wrestling fan, is weird to see WWE in r/science
$C: There are dozens of us! Dozens!
$C: You know Rusev is over when he leaks into /r/science.

Come on Vince, push that beautiful Bulgarian bastard!
$C: As were Hawking's diapers near the end I'd imagine.
$C: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)
$C: Well, there is not other way to celebrate Pi day in the other format and the 14th of March is always going to be Pi day anyway, so he passed away on Pi day. 
$C: If you go by YYYY-MM-DD it's still in that order, I guess. There's not really any way to have Pi day with the day before the month.
$C: Absolutely agree. It was just one of those occasions for me that was an example of the heuristic (can't remember the name of it) where people tend to see one good attribute in a person and extrapolate it to think that they are equally good/competent in other unrelated attributes. I did that a lot when I was young.
$C: Worst case of Hawk Foot we ever did see.  
$C: And thus, a new prophet shall be born, this day.
$C: Shh bb iz ok
$C: *Twilight Zone theme*
$C: I know that you are being jokful, but I really want there to be more than just cynical humor in society. Do you disagree that that type of humor has been dominating for ages? At least when it comes to AI? Where is the wholesome AI and human interactions?
$C: This remains to be proven. It'll be an excellent test of a HUGE amount of presumptions/hyptheses/theories about the human mind and the nature of consciousness the day we can actually do this. However, we're right now at the level where we can "roughly" (there's still some simplification) simulate the brain of a C.Elegans, a 1mm roundworm with a whopping 302 neurons and 7000 synapses. The human brain has 86 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses.
$C: Where are you getting this from? Do you know any research team currently able to simulate a brain perfectly?
$C: This is the way a quite considerable and vocal majority of modern day 21st century "Atheists" view the cosmos, and they consider it to be true rationality. 
$C: Yep we're from the same era. It's scary and exciting at the same time. We probably can't even fathom what's to come in 20-30 years 
$C: [deleted]
$C: I'm sorry for your loss. That is doubly heartbreaking.

I have no doubt it could give you PTSD. I still break down crying thinking about that day, especially under stress, and it's been four years. It feels surreal thinking back on it. Calling my dad from the hospital, seeing a man handcuffed to a gurney with a cop next to him looking at me bawling, the sound of my dad's voice when I told him, the look in my mom's eyes when she collapsed, the last words I heard he say before she got into the ambulance. The look in her eyes haunted me for months. My aunt and uncle who were coming to visit from the other side of the country arriving hours after she died, just missing her.

E: If you think what happened is affecting your psychologically there's nothing wrong in getting counseling if you can. I haven't and I think I should/have.
$C: Very fitting. Funny how the chaos of the universe lines up sometimes.
$C: Hey, maybe Galileo died and reincarnated as Hawking, then Hawking died and reincarnated as Einstein. Time travel confirmed!
$C: He was the chosen one.
$C: Einstein was born today?
$C: NDT already planning his death 18 years from now.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Hawking also liked to point out that he was born 300 years after the year 1642, when Galileo died and Sir Isaac Newton was born. 
$C: He died on the same date as Karl Marx, too
$C: Theoretical physicist.
$C: An astrophysicist would remind us Galileo died 300 years before Hawkins was born.
$C: We need to find the new avatar
$C: Wow Galileo lived pretty damn long
$C: [deleted]
$C: The question is who was born today?
$C: unfortunately galileo died on 1/8/1642 (& his birthdate was 2/15) - but Einstein, yes, was born 3/14.
$C: I guess Galileo died on January 8, 1642 .
$C: Cosmologist; subtly different :)
$C: We have it now.
$C: I just hope he/she won't born in a poor country
$C: The size of a black hole
$C: Don't pollute.
$C: Fire indeed hot!
$C: I have every season on DVD, and just watched this episode on Monday.
$C: Stop making your comments so big. 
$C: I think he means because of date formatting

3/14 vs 31/4
$C: Many countries state the day before the month when mentioning dates.
$C: I live in Mexico, and I study topological spaces combined with chaotic theories. I almost get hit by cars every day, and I look both ways. People here just don't care if I'm allowed to cross the street.
$C: They can't help it; looking before crossing was their destiny
$C: Yeah that logic is faulty.  Interesting sentiment but faulty. 

I could just as easily say that Hawking was destined for greatness and the impossible odds and limitations he overcame are the proof that he was fated to achieve that greatness, regardless of his circumstances.  

Neither one of us could disprove the other. 
$C: But maybe you're predestined to survive crossing the road as a result of looking both ways and reacting to what you see.
$C: He said as much.  

https://www.biography.com/people/stephen-hawking-9331710

>In a sense, Hawking's disease helped him become the noted scientist he is today. Before the diagnosis, Hawking hadn't always focused on his studies. "Before my condition was diagnosed, I had been very bored with life," he said. "There had not seemed to be anything worth doing." With the sudden realization that he might not even live long enough to earn his PhD, Hawking poured himself into his work and research. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Very few people actually understand this. I guess Hawking was one that did at a certain point in his life.
$C: Yeah he definitely worked extremely hard to incorporate the illness into his personality. Like when he was first given the computer to help him speak, it was a problem that the accent was American. Years ago he was offered an upgrade to make it sound British but he refused because the original voice had become *his*.
$C: The adversity effect 
$C: I think so too. As bad as ALS was, it gave him the ability to think a lot more than anyone. He didn't have to (nor could he) worry about moving limbs or even speaking. 
$C: Yea, if I remember correctly he wasn't all that great a student, or all that devoted to his work until he was diagnosed. As he was able to do fewer things, he focused more intently on the science.

Edit: he was one of my favorite people of note. I'll miss knowing he's around. RIP.
$C: Are people actually thinking ALS acted in any way shape or form as a propellant or motivating factor? That’s pretty bold
$C: Absolutely!
Just read Michael j fox biography. 
$C: Yes
$C: Saddens me to think that there might be a person out there somewhere with make a wish that just received this news 
$C: he understood a greater depth to humanity by facing an incredible struggle.
$C: [That story is preposterous! Stephen Hawking, in a pizzeria? Phooey.] (https://youtu.be/Nda7w487yU0)

[RIP Stephen.] (https://youtu.be/AW-p8s_HCCo) 
$C: A horny SOB too, with the giant Marilyn Monroe poster behind him. What is this Hawking, college?! 

RIP
$C: That model is really intriguing i may have to steal it
$C: He also a a picture of his Simpson character on the right side of his head. 
$C: If that thing isn’t immortalized in a museum somewhere, I think I’m about to spend mine and someone else’s life savings on that thing at auction. 
$C: And a crystal ball!
$C: Some autistic people are nice, some are here's.

The spectrum covers a wide range of people.

You are classified as autistic if you exhibit over a certain number of traits.

If you no longer show these traits, you are no longer autistic. Some people can be "cured."

But I was on the low end of the spectrum to begin with.

So Newton could have been autistic while being an asshole or he could just be autistic or maybe he is just an asshole. All those possibilities are possibilities.
$C: Since when has harmonious living in the old world ever been a prerequisite for colonizing a new one? If any it's the lack of harmony that inspires people to work towards colonization and migration.
$C: Yep. The right to live and have children are one of those things that all free people ought to have. And besides that, it's just a tad bit insensitive to bring up eugenics in a thread about Stephen Hawking.
$C: And neither can you. They’re coming for you.
$C: You're probably joking, but in case you didn't know, on his show he aired a piece where he was at a certain location at a certain time, and if anyone **ever** discovered how to go back in time, that *eventually someone* would decide to travel to his party. No one did, so that tells us it will never be possible to go back in time.
$C: Or something happens between now and when time travel is discovered that erases any record of his invitation and therefore no one knew to show up.
$C: I'm sure they'll pay condolences where he lies while nobody else is looking.
$C: Anyone got the over/under on how long it’ll be until this ends up on the front page of r/TodayILearned ?
$C: And he would say this is all coincidence. Which it is. Still cool though.
$C: Also on 3.14
$C: And wasn't Newton born on Galileo's death?
$C: He also survived 2016
$C: Rest in peace to all of them
$C: Is there something we can do with these numbers to predict the birth of the next great science person?
$C: Wait. Hawking was born the day of Galileo's death, Einstein on Hawking's... A case could be made for reincarnation. 
$C: We just have to keep an eye out for the next major physicist in the next 30-50 years when he reincarnates again. 
$C: Yeah this guy Neal Grass titan said in the cosmos that us human beings could recognize patterns really well, thanks Neal 
$C: > Einsteins birthday

Yes

> exact same age

Exact same number of whole years*
$C: Most of the world does not mm-dd-yyyy. Its Pi day for the USA and a couple of small countries.
$C: [deleted]
$C: He died at home, in England, where it's been March 14 for some few hours, and his family said it happened on the 14th, so that's good enough for me.
$C: Soul transfer lag. Lags everywhere in the universe.
$C: I believe it was already the 14th in Cambridge fwiw.
$C: I like this idea quite a lot. We need to make it look organic though, a forced meme is a bad meme. 
$C: What do you mean? I have a great deal of respect for the man. In what way is saying things that are not true more respectful?
$C: It doesn’t, but my point was that there’s no reason to qualify it with “given his issues” in that statement.

Any cognitive decline he had would have been independent of his issues.
$C: If it brings you any comfort, no one knows if it's truly the end. We started as stardust, and you and me and everything shall return to that place one day. While the body may decay, what made us will always exist in one form or another for all of time. Don't live your life for what will be, live your life for what is. That way there are few regrets. I hope that helps in some small way. :)
$C: I'm right there with you. I have to always push death out of my mind because it terrifies me. Not existing? Terrifying. Also, I'll miss out on all the amazing things humans will do. I'll miss out on the rest of the story of the universe. Billions of years and I was only around for maybe 80 of them. That sucks and it's a very scary thought. No matter what anyone says, it never gets any better.
$C: Hey there! Thanks for the reminder! I got so caught up in my final semester of college I completely forgot I even owned any books.

Having just received my final grades, this is the perfect time to sit down and finish this book (amongst others). You could not of had better timing with this reply.

Thank you! 
$C: It was a bit sobering how he rarely spoke of the existence of intelligent life outside of Earth, but when he did so, he stated that they'd likely erase us. Seeing how we treat one another sometimes, I can't blame them. Hopefully they'd at least spare the rest of the planet, so that angry calosoma beetles can inherit their rightful place as the supreme life form.
$C: Kessel run, are the words you're looking for.
$C: the wheel that begins to turn will never cease, something like that, i forget my original intention but that should be close enough
$C: “Anti-science” 
$C: I want to bereave.
$C: I want to believe
$C: noice. time dilation day.
$C: You too, a bit late \^^
$C: And still making music I believe
$C: All that is great, plenty of people meanwhile also hold a not so great opinion on NHS. While Hawking had a great experience no doubt, not everyone has a similar "great" experience. If I speak negatively about about NHS in this thread to reply to your argument I feel I will be doing a disservice to Professor's legacy by being spiteful against against his political views. Again, discussing his controversial political views in a thread that is meant for appreciation of his life and work. While, all of us are entitled to our opinions, there is a thing called common decency. For instance, I would not like to go to a coworkers funeral and talk about the time he embezzled company funds, even if it is true. In similar vein I would rather not talk about Professor's political opinions even if I find them wrong. This would seem like a perfect platform for those who affirm with his polarizing opinions about NHS, because if you agree you are good, but if you disagree you are the asshole who cant keep his opinions out of an appreciation thread. Hope you catch my drift.

Also, I don't really know if I would consider NHS as non controversial. I do not live in the UK but I would consider NHS the torch bearer of public healthcare systems all over the world, similar to how US is for private healthcare. Private vs public healthcare is a controversial topic. And the way the initial comment to which I reacted was worded there was some element of appreciation for public healthcare instead of specifically for NHS. But maybe I'm reading too much into a harmless statement.
$C: I'm not sure how much Hawking's actual *research* is well-known. He's famous for his best-sellers and the tremendous struggles he'd overcome 
$C: That's because Hawking was more of a personality than the rest of the people I named.

Maybe it was because of his disability that people became fascinated with him and his work. Most of what he worked on was very esoteric, yet the public lapped it up.
$C: Honestly, people are looking for faults to find and following the hatejerk. It may be because they feel that Tyson and Nye (to a lesser extent) transitioned from nerd culture to mainstream.

I mean, you criticism of Tyson is a perfect example. Tyson is a self-proclaimed agnostic who has repeatedly said he doesn't identify as atheist and has no issue with religion as long as it doesn't interfere with your research. He also loudly proclaims that a large number of stem educated people are religious (in terms of "pray to a personal god").
$C: I really don't enjoy watching Brian or Neil DeGrasse talk about physics on talk shows personally. They're forced to make the discussion so trivial and flashy that it sorta just comes off irritating.
$C: That's hardly a representation of the British public. You'd expect science students to have heard of him 

You say Cosmos was a very popular programme, but I don't even remember it being shown on TV here, possibly it was tucked away on National Geographic? (the original Cosmos series is more well known and has been in the BBC) 

His level of famousness in the UK is 'answer to a difficult pub quiz question' 
$C: What was will be.
$C: He was referencing this

https://i.imgur.com/YQi3ZFz.jpg
$C: Lots of Latin phrases just leave the pronouns out entirely and you're supposed to infer them from context.
$C: Ohh so it was more “I feel for you that you didn’t feel loved by your nan” than my original reading of “it’s sad that you’re an unfeeling monster that couldn’t summon up sadness for a poor old woman”? Alright, I’ll take it. Sorry I misunderstood. 
$C: And he's not finished with it yet...
$C: Wich means pi day doesnt exist because it simply doesnt exist anywhere else in the world 
$C: The halo effect.
$C: Pi day
$C: Hodl me
$C: My Life as a Teenage Robot? That show was pretty rad
$C: The government/a corporation could probably simulate something much more advanced given funding. OpenWorm is done on a purely volunteer basis, after all.
$C: I could do it in my sleep! Just 13 billion simple if/else statements! Ezpz
$C: He is answering the last part of the question , whether it is possible or not. And as anything can be simulated inside a computer given enough memory and CPU cycle, a complex organ like the brain wouldn't be impossible, theoretically. It is an another question whether it is feasible to create something like that or not 
$C: I was purely theoretical. We can simulate simple molecules, so it would seem possible in future to simulate all of brain. It's probably far from practical and machine intelligence is the way to go.
$C: ALS has incredibly rapid decline in most cases. I've seen patients that only had half a year after their diagnosis untilbthey couldn't walk anymore and were incapable of facial expressions/talking.
$C: im not crying dammit
$C: Wouldnt this be "[the birthday paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem)"

Its actually extremely common for 2 dates to line up, more common than you would think.
$C: Chaos is a ladder. 
$C: Birthday paradox. Sorry.
$C: Entropy can be a beautiful thing
$C: always a method to the chaos. We just not smart enough to understand it =P
$C: Free will doesn't exist, everything is pre-destined
$C: God works in mysterious ways.

Edit: do I really need to explain that this wasn't serious?
$C: And Einstein died on April 18 (David Tennant's birthday).

Maybe all these guys really were Time Lords, without us realizing it...
$C: I'd watch that movie. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: I was wondering if I would have to be the guy to make this joke. This should be higher!
$C: I'm Poincaré.
$C: Sounds like another sequel of Predestination.
$C: He’s done a lot for being less than a day old
$C: As OP said, that's the day Hawking was born.
$C: Touche. 
$C: Stephen Hawking's birthday
$C: Jezus wasn't born on Christmas and yet we pretend he was. Don't spoil the facts with your data. 
$C: Stephen Hawking was born on 1/8/1942. 
$C: Cosmology is a pretty way of saying things. Prove it!
$C: Sending out gravity waves and evaporating via virtual particles... truly saddened about his loss, our loss.
$C: does black hole have size

edit: am seriously curious
$C: So, subatomic...
$C: Too bad there's not an April 31st. 
$C: I litteraly thought about the date, but I totally forgot about date formating. Thank you.
$C: Exactly, their biological makeup combined with their life experiences have conditioned them to look before crossing the road, looking is their pre-destiny.
$C: i guess if he had one of the great minds of our time, perhaps his limitations focused him into an academic path and made it a little easier or something.
$C: I was thinking about this again this morning. If he was destined for greatness and his handicaps were not an impediment, then there should be other heavily handicapped people who have reached his level of respect and renown. Yet I can only think of one: Helen Keller (and FDR, almost.  At least FDR could WRITE, so he could record his thoughts.) Helen Keller gained a bachelor of arts and became a writer, political activist, and lecturer despite being both blind and deaf. Stephen Hawking was partially mute and couldn't write, and had loss of locomotion, yet he was the world's top authority in certain astrophysical phenomena. I don't think greatness was his fate as much as it was his determination and skill to get there despite the limitations he suffered.  

Edit: to be clear, I don't think Helen Keller reached his level of renown, but I also think she overcame a greater handicap at a time when there were fewer technological aids, and so I think their achievements are similar.
$C: Yes, this is fine and valid, but you’re attempt at out smarting a genius is making you miss the point.

His point was intent vs. destiny.

If you look before you cross, then your intent is to avoid death, which means you are trying to shape your fate, which means you don’t believe in destiny.

But if you truly believed in a destiny (you will die when you cross or you will live when you cross) then you wouldn’t need to look. 
$C: In the case it means that “fate” is conditional, which makes it a bit paradoxical if you think about it.

Either it’s meant to be or it’s not. Otherwise it’s confirmation bias.
$C: Then it is not predestined at all since you can just over-ride your supposedly chosen "destiny" by doing a simple thing like not looking  both ways when you cross.
$C: I can only find this version: "When one's expectations are reduced to zero, one really appreciates everything one does have." Where's the quote from? I'd like to read/hear it in context.
$C: He was extremely brilliant before ALS too and would have done just as much, probably just with less recognition and fame
$C: It is a DEmotivator for discovery, thinking, and ultimately life.  In no way it was helping SH. 
$C: >He believed his illness brought some benefits; he said before he developed the disease he had been bored with life.

From his BBC obituary. So apparently he himself did.
$C: It forced him to live differently than "normal" and it forced him to think of life differently and to accept it. It surely made life more challenging in many ways, and surely made some things slower to accomplish. But it also shaped his personality and actions and had its part in making him who he was, just like any big factors and changes in life.
$C: From what I understand although he was always intelligent he didn't really apply himself until after the ALS was diagnosed. It was that which pushed him to apply himself more to theoretical physics as less "physical distractions" were open to him. 


$C: Clearly you never heard about his affair with his nurse...
$C: If I were to guess, I would say that the contents of his office will probably end up in a trust or be donated to the university he worked for.

That said, it's not a special item. They can be found online. They are not cheap though. But that specific one is probably worth far more.
$C: I was being humorous.
$C: Precisely.
$C: What are they going to do? Take m
$C: Or that the information about the party was lost to the whims of future and inevitable grind of time.
$C: >so that tells us it will never be possible to go back in time

no, it tells us that nobody showed up. It might be possible but simply too expensive to waste on something silly, maybe there are regulations in place that forbid meddling, maybe only a handful of people have access to that hypotethical technology, etc etc.

I'm not arguing that time travel is real or anything like that, just saying that your conclusion is very flawed.
$C: But I knew that.… Nevertheless, as good a joke as schrodinger’s  cat.
$C: It's already there twice over
$C: I give it until later today.
$C: Hawking would know :(
$C: He would know when the best portals to the after life would be open. 
$C: Headline reads: “Physicists Now Studying the Theory of Reincarnation”. 
$C: Maybe he's like Dr Who and just evolved into his latest incarnation.
$C: Why are you so sure it’s a he
$C: I like this idea.
$C: We are already in the presence of those of greatness.
$C: As much as a I know this is kind of a Joke, there well may be the next big physicist alive now, we just don't know about his discoveries yet - take Tesla for example
$C: Perhaps he / she was born today
$C: Come on, let's not degrade Hawking's memory with superstitious nonsense.
$C: I don't know if this is a typo, but don't change it.
$C: also Pi Day
$C: It's still Pi day .. just we don't celebrate it! Like 4th July is still America's Independence Day .. we just don't celebrate it :P

(also, I found out it was Pi day about 3mins ago, and spent three minutes wondering why it was Pi day until I read your comment .. so thanks! - Australia)
$C: In Poland we use dd-mm format, yet the mathematic community celebrates Pi day today. So I'd guess it's true elsewhere. 
$C: You mean 31st of April. May 31st is 31/5.
$C: The sources I checked last night, when I wrote my comment, said he had died on the 13th, but they've been updated to the 14th. I'm happy with the change--it's much more appropriate this way.
$C: The sources I checked last night, when I wrote my comment, said he had died on the 13th, but they've been updated to the 14th. I'm happy with the change--it's much more appropriate this way.


$C: But can it be truly organic now that the seed has been planted?
$C: Maybe I worded it weird, but I thought it was completely lame of you. The guy just died and people are expressing their appreciation, admiration and sadness and you just had to tell eveyone how he wasn’t the smartest person to ever exist and that his contributions aren’t as impactful as some others. I hope someone stands up at your funeral and tells your kids that you never really deserved that Worlds Number One Dad mug because, technically, you weren’t. It just demonstrates a lack of awareness of the basic social niceties. Have you had problems with things like this previously in your life?
$C: A lot of people could have gone crazy!
$C: Thank you for being uplifting. ;w; It's true no matter what, it's important to try and make the most of what we have in the moment.
$C: That was beautiful.
$C: Exactly this. And as weird as it sounds, it feels like we're in the minority. Many people say they are comforted by the thought of not being in the end, and I could never, ever understand that. And that as well- what if I miss out on actual forays into space by humanity? What if we actually get our crap together and manage to do wonderful things? I don't want to miss that.
$C: I think he meant roll. As in Hawking's wheelchair. I could be misinterpeting though
$C: I am by no means an authority on Latin, but I think “rota quae incipit vertere numquam requiescet” is closer to what you meant then.

Edit: Changed qui to quae to agree with rota (f).
$C: That's... not very close at all 
$C: If he died at 1:59 AM... 3.14 1:59

$C: If I have to explain why voicing appreciation for public healthcare that saved your life is different from committing a felony, this is a lost cause.

$C: > I mean, you criticism of Tyson is a perfect example. Tyson is a self-proclaimed agnostic who has repeatedly said he doesn't identify as atheist and has no issue with religion as long as it doesn't interfere with your research. He also loudly proclaims that a large number of stem educated people are religious (in terms of "pray to a personal god").

But that's exactly "it".  Hawking didn't proclaim anything.  He managed to stay above the fray.  Hawking and Sagen were able to do what they did without coming off as condescending, which I think Tyson sometimes does.  They were almost philosophers as much as they were scientists.  I think that's the part Tyson is missing.

Nye doesn't deserve to be mentioned in this conversation.
$C: > You'd expect science students to have heard of him

Only one of the people I mentioned was a science student.
$C: I recognized the structure and chose to explain anyway.
$C: Ah, the joys of synthetic languages.

Language Analytic English, a Contrast is in.
$C: ^^we#hodlgangnow?
$C: Oh absolutely. A fruit fly brain will be possible to simulate in the near future, and is much more advanced at 135000 neurons.

We're still many decades away from being able to simulate a human brain, and there are huge hurdles to 'brain simulation' even if we *did* have capable hardware. I don't doubt we'll get to that point in terms of sheer computing capability, but even when we get there, providing this artificial brain with any kind of useful *state* is going to be a challenge all of its own.
$C: May be simulation is possible at a molecular level - but is there proof that's enough? Is the sum of parts equal to the whole?

I haven't heard of any research that posits that - but am curious. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: youre crying
$C: Stop cutting onions!
$C: There are only 365 options.  0.27% isn't that low.  It's bound to happen all the time.
$C: Easy now, littlefinger.
$C: This. He's pretty much guaranteed to die/be born on the date of some famous scientist. Pick any date at random.
$C: > do I really need to explain that this wasn't serious?

If Poe's Law wasn't a thing, then no.

But Poe's Law is very, very much a thing.

Plus, even on Reddit, there are a lot of theists.
$C: There is so many people that because of the pigeonhole principle it can happen easily. 
$C: But did they meet. You can live in ty e same time as your reincarnation, you just can't meet. 
$C: Real life thoughts and prayers
$C: ♡ Hawking Radiation ♡
$C: Not really sure. As far as i understand it, the black hole itself is a singularity. A one dimensional infinitesimal object. What we would call the black hole is the event horizon. The point where light can no longer escape, so just the sphere of influence of its gravitational pull where nothing can escape.

Source: Am nerd. Actual physicist feel free to correct me.
$C: Yeah about the size of a pea.

edit: Seriously.
$C: Not with that attitude, there's not
$C: I'm well aware of that but I'm not sure the person above does. For d/m/y formatters, Pi day comes a lot less frequently.
$C: It's not like Darwin says.
$C: No not conditional. You looking both ways on the road is fate playing itself out. You're 'doomed to be safe' because fate dictates you're the sort of person to always check the road even if you believe it's ultimately up to fate.
$C: Fate doesn't exist. God doesn't exist. Infinity doesn't exist, and if they exist we shouldn't be worried about it. Work on something that matters. Study a new definition of axioms and be able to surpass Gödel's incompleteness.
$C: You can't override it though. If you go out and walk into the road without looking, it's a result of this conversation. It's not pre-ordained as such, just you can't choose otherwise because of all historical events. You reading this thread might cause you to think about crossing without looking, something you wouldn't have contemplated before. And whether you do or don't depends on how stubborn you are to prove you point which itself depends on your genes and upbringing. You will choose the same choice every time.
$C: Maybe even more, his confinement and lack of independence reduced the variety of stimulus he could expose himself to.
$C: [deleted]
$C: It could have fueled his passion always knowing how limited his time here would be. It also almost necessarily brought him lots of hardship and we can't say for sure how much his sickness contributed or took away from his work.
$C: Oh I heard. Just didn’t want to sully his name in the memorial thread. But yea, brother was all about dat m..ass?
$C: My bad :(
$C: But if it is possible to go back in time, there is an infinite possibility that someone will eventually find the information to travel to Stephen's party.
$C: I feel that your conclusions are simply limited by time. Too expensive, handful of people, laws. That'd all eventually change with time.
$C: ^Even this comment is a re-post. 
$C: When we eventually create time travel, we can finally go back to his time travel party he didn't announce until the day after..  but we didn't. So we never create time travel. Unless, we just haven't yet. We will go to his party when we do.. evetually.  But nobody showed. So we never do..  unless, we did/do, but he just said nobody came, because that was the only way to preserve the timeline..
$C: Haha yes. And it's totally strange to me that today is the official pi day. But that's just me i guess :-D
$C: People were probably eager to report and overlooked the fact that Hawking didn't live in the timezone they were sitting in when they heard the news.

Gotta get them ad clicks early.
$C: Look, I’m barely smart enough to be in this sub, I’m definitely not smart enough to work out organic meme farming. 
$C: Isn't that how organic things grow? *Thinking*

actively trying to psychologically hurt/destabilize me

are even more not nice than me making a comment that wasn't even supposed to be hurtful in the first place, deep down in a reddit thread where noone who personally knew the guy will read it. Maybe we can agree neither of us was being very nice.
$C: Anyone can go crazy. Even people in otherwise perfect health, living otherwise pretty ordinary lives.
$C: Ah, that would make sense. 
$C: i tried my best.
$C: Intensity intensifies
$C: This is technically correct in one part of the world. 
$C: No it's not, maybe you are just seeing it from a biased lens. Maybe both of us are. Have you thought about that?
$C: OK, a house full of students. Web savvy, inquisitive students. The sort who will be exactly the sort of people who would stumble across or seek out his content.

The fact remains that you could walk down any high street in the UK and ask people if they know who he is and you'd get very few who do.


$C: I only knew the "ad Astra" part, thanks for explaining the whole thing.
$C: We aren't discussing consciousness, so in this case the sum of parts is equal to the whole, otherwise it breaks current theories of physics.
$C: You're forgetting the UK has free at point of use healthcare provided by the NHS. [He's said so himself](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/health-40990288/stephen-hawking-i-wouldn-t-be-here-without-the-nhs)
$C: I’m crying 😭 
$C: I’m making a lasagna! For one
$C: Sure but that famous? All three of them are in the top 10 of all time. Source: me.
$C: there ARE a lot of people...thanks you for riding that philosophical edge for all of us. 
$C: But how many people significant to astrophysics? I feel like there aren’t 365 that would be known by anyone for how successful they were in the field.
$C: I don't know, but I'd say they didn't. The encounter could have created a time paradox, the result of which could have caused a chain reaction and unravel the very fabric of the space-time continuum and destroy the entire universe.
$C: I believe it has no size because we can't measure it correctly. We make hypothesis, and Hawkins had a quite accurate understanding; however, the right way to measure it would be to solve a dynamic gravitational equation. Then, we should find the graviton. Finally, establish the link between gravity and time, and then it is a matter of time to build an Alcubierre drive.
$C: When people refer to a black hole's "size," they're generally referring to the volume of the area contained within the event horizon. The entire phenomenon is called a black hole, the singularity is just the hypothetical point at the center. If a black hole was large enough, you could theoretically pass through the event horizon and observe the interior without being shredded by tidal forces.

Of course, you're not coming back then either.
$C: What do you mean? People who learn to look before crossing live and pass on their genes, those who don’t die and don’t.
$C: In that case, if you put fate behind everything, even choices, then there is no reason for fate to exist in the first place.

Fate is more or less the opposite of choice.
$C: Actually if I remember correctly, the progression of his ALS was exactly what motivated him to accomplish his works. He was a brilliant yet unfocused man before it began. He may have been a medium level celeb for a few years then disappeared into a small college to find the next rising genius if he lasted that long. Not a horrible life at all. What the ALS did was force him to slow down and focus his energy and it produced his life. He would not be who he was without it. 
$C: I suspect that's a copimg mechanism to not fall into deep depression.  How can exertion of an hour of effort to output a single sentence be a benefit?  Noting and reviewing becomes a monumental effort, let alone basic human interaction to prevent depression. SH is certainly a genius and hero despite of it. 
$C: It's alright, man. It happens.
$C: Yes, but information can also be lost with time. It could be that by the time traveling to the party was viable, the information about the party had long been lost to the sands of time.
$C: The point still stands, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence
$C: Or there is a ban on attending it, to keep time travel secret from us who aren't ready.
$C: It'll happen eventually. It just didn't happen in our current timeline.
$C: Or the furthest back they can travel is the moment the machine was first turned on.
$C: Only he would know
$C: Probably because something has to happen first, that's why there is no real future, only a past. To travel to the future would mean that we'd need to add more light which isn't even there?
$C: Well, I did look at what I thought were fairly reputable online news sources (not just what redditors were thinking) before I made my comment. So it's a good lesson in how information on a sudden event can be initially unreliable. 
$C: The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge. - S. Hawking
$C: we already have the seed now we just need the soil (a good story) and water it, carefully. too little and it won't grow, too much and it will die by overmemetitis
$C: What I mean to say is, being trapped inside of your body with little outlet would drive a lot of people insane. Hawking found a way around being trapped which is fantastic, but if he didn't I wonder how he might have faired?
$C: The best kind of correct.
$C: The teaching students? So 5 out of about 30 people...

You're really reaching to make this point.
$C: I am probably missing something but are you saying  simulating  a brain without consciousness is the same as simulating all of brain?
$C: I will back up his source with one of my own. 

Source: me 
$C: Hmm true. I guess if you say top 10 only then you're down to 0.3% or so by chance alone. Reject the null hypothesis, God exists!
$C: And the birthday paradox only requires 23 people for it to be more likely that dates are shared than not.

With each scientist bringing both a birth date AND a death date, if there are 12 big scientists, it becomes more unusual if they didnt share a birth/death date. (yes, I know both birth and death dates can line up on the same date for the same individual, but I cant do the math atm)
$C: That's because people is too busy drinking cola, watching football, and having thousands of children.
$C: Exactly. 
$C: I don't blame you for thinking that way. You were predestined to believe that.
$C: Fate doesn't exist. Evolution is a choice, not strength. At least in this point of our time. Time is a human construction too. There is too much people in this world, and they are all destroying it.
$C: There is fate, where your choices don't matter, and complete predeterminism, where you have no choice as such in the first place and everything you do is just the result of a biological computer converting inputs into outputs. The former idea is observably bollocks, but the latter makes a lot of sense, even if it doesn't actually mean much in day to day life (it does have interesting implications, e.g. for how we should treat offenders)
$C: Then there is this little thing called probability field in quantum physics.
$C: Why would it need a reason? It is what it is.

You do what you do because you are who you are. Doesn't matter if you put "fate" behind everything or not - it's still fate. 

Or to put it biologically: you just have nature and nuture, you don't have some magical soul that can will the path of the universe in another direction, hence your fate is set. 
$C: Hmm, should try to invent a way to give kids a good scare and then remove the disease once they get it together.
$C: So if someone were to post the details of the party here, and the more it gets shared, that would increase the likelihood that either time travel is not possible, or something catastrophic occurred to civilization.
$C: Still a small number.

My point still remains. Believe me - he is not well known in the UK, we have our own very famous science communicators who have millions of TV viewers and are known by everyone 
$C: I said it to avoid the discussion on consciousness, but here we go. I personally believe that a perfectly simulated brain with a human past would see itself as a human, so it would be conscious. So I see consciousness as an emergent phenomena that is still explainable via science. Something like the brain simulating your environment and body and suddenly it realizes it is simulating itself inside the simulation, and an infinite loop begins: the simulator is simulating the simulator, which is simulating the simulator etc.... I believe this leads to the strong feeling of being conscious.
$C: Isn't the birthday paradox about any two people in the group sharing a birthday, not a particular person sharing a birthday with someone else in the group?
$C: Nobody is thinking, everybody just enjoys pleasure and consumerism.
$C: Exactly
$C: Eons ago, there was a Big Bang (or something that happened) which set a chain of events in motion that you have absolutely no control over. This chain of events was and is incredibly complex and impossible to track or predict. As a result of this, one of the things that happened was Earth, a planet where life was able to develop to the point of human beings, a small part of the universe that is aware of itself.

But, all we are is a combination of our genes and our life experiences/interactions with our environment, two things we have no control over. These two things are just a continuation of the giant explosion that happened eons ago, and we are just a small part of that explosion as it continues to unfold with no control over it or even our own lives. Everything is just a long chain of events unfolding.
$C: Humans are one of the very few animals (I want to say the only but I can’t support that) that can overwrite behaviour. It’s called mental plasticity and it’s what allows us to go on hunger strikes or protest with self-conflagration.

You can argue that mental plasticity is also the result of “nature”, since it’s the genes that give us our intelligence that produce this “behaviour-overwriting behaviour”. But if you do that, then you also have to go back to the whole nature vs nurture. Isn’t the ability and capacity to be taught/nurtured also controlled by genes and therefore nature?

Free will might not exist in the context that most people imagine it does but we are also not pure biological machines, like microorganisms are.
$C: I replied to Mithious below for both of your posts.

From my experience (having lived in Nottingham and Scarborough for a few years), most people seem to know who he is. Certainly a smaller fraction of people know Tyson in the UK than in the US, but to say he's "barely known" seems wrong.

And the Christmas Lectures aren't well known in the US, so far fewer people know of Dr. Cox in the US, but his face can still be seen on US television from time to time.
$C: I just wanted to confirm there are no known proofs here and your point about simulation is a belief rather than science. That's all. 
$C: > enjoys pleasure

Ya don't say
$C: A big bang is a theory. I believe there is a more complete way to understand the physical aspects of our world. Quantum mechanics can be globally defined with enough effort. Topological embedded spaces with stochastic variables can be modeled with certain parameters, and we can model a general equilibrium.
$C: Maybe that's just the natural result of having a more complex brain and a higher intelligence than other animals. This isn't really a debate about nature or nurture, this is about whether our brain is 'simply' a computer following the laws of physics, receiving input, providing output, and constantly reprogramming itself evolving based on that input. Or alternatively, does it reach some of magical branching point where a choice is required, the universe pauses for a moment, and some "force of free will" allows us to step in and pick A or B.

If you want to remain purely in the realm of science then at a very high level we're a bunch of ridiculously complicated computers running around performing our programming. Implying we have choice over whether to look before crossing the road is like saying a calculator chose the answer of 4 when you asked it for 2 plus 2. If it returns 5 then its programming is faulty, much like someone that crosses the road without looking.
$C: scare them straight, they'll come around
$C: That's virtually exactly what you wrote in your first reply.

Barely known is correct. He's known by a niche who have seen his stuff online or the few thousand who watch Nat Geo. Compare with our home-grown equivalents such as Cox, Attenborough or Moore who are household names because they get 10 million viewers on BBC1 or presented the world's longest running science programme. 

I'm not sure what you mean about the Christmas Lectures, that's nothing to do with Brian Cox. They have a different scientist every year doing 5 lectures, I think Brian did it one year but it's not his gig. Anyway I said right from the start that neither is well known in the other country 
$C: Yeah you're right. That's the problem with beliefs because they are so easy to trust when facing unknown. I'll try to avoid intuitive beliefs and seek proofs.
$C: Well, that's what I see.
$C: You don’t have to believe in the Big Bang to believe a complex chain of events was set in motion long before we came into existence that we have no control over.
$C: Easy to say it, difficult to prove it. I'm working on it. If you are interested, please reply and be specific. I don't enjoy wasting my time. Which, by the way, is a human construction to make us slaves. I'm being way too humoristic.
$C: You are equating result with choice and the wrong choice with mental illness.

If I look both ways, it’s the right choice.
If I close my eyes and step in the street, I’m defective.
This makes sense but it doesn’t imply determinism or fate.
The choice weighting did take place in my brain. Just because one of them was filtered out by some process (self-preservation in this case) it doesn’t mean that I couldn’t act on it if I had decided to.

For example, if I decide to overwrite my survival instincts and step in the traffic, l will either be hit or not. You come and say it’s fate either way or if I don’t get hit you say it was my fate not to die that moment or you say I was mentally ill if I do get hit.

All of the above have a common characteristic. They are all after-the-fact assignments to the results of choice weighting. Very similar to confirmation bias.

(I feel like I’m not making much sense. English is not my first language and these complex thoughts are hard to put down in writing)
$C: Or scar them for life. 50/50 shot 
$C: > Barely known is correct.

$C: Maybe I'm wrong.
$C: Does god exist? I don't care. I just want to do something that actually matters concisely. It is not enough with saying things. Is war fine? Is poverty good? I would love to die right now, but I think I can help. Meanwhile, please, go and drink cola, watch soccer, have three kids, produce millions of tons of thrash, and I'll wait for a thunder to strike me while I'm on top of the Empire State Building.

$C: > For example, if I decide to overwrite my survival instincts and step in the traffic

My point would be the current programming, operation state, and inputs to your brain always meant that in that moment you were not going to look and instead step in to traffic.

What happens after that, i.e. whether you actually get hit or not, is irrelevant.

Imagine you do this, you override your survival instincts, step into the road and get hit. Now imagine I'm sitting over here with the magical ability to rewind time, I do this and rewind time to the moment before you made that decision.

Will you make a different decision? Or will you do exactly the same thing again?

If the universe is predetermined then given the same inputs you'll be making the same decision no matter how many times we 'rerun' it, in which case the entire concept of free will is a useful illusion and nothing more.
$C: Yeah, but it's just the illusion of free will. It may not be pre-determined, but your choices are the result of all prior events/actions/thoughts/influences. You have no control over these. As a result of this thread on Reddit you might decide to make a zany decision, which itself is confirmatory. Does it even matter anyway, if you believe it to be free choice?
$C: >it doesn’t mean that I couldn’t act on it if I had decided to.

Yes but what does it mean to say *you could act on it*? By what mechanism of nature do you have choice? If you could actually make a choice without that choice being completely determined by previous events then you would break the law of causality (not to mention conservation of energy) - if so Einstein among others would like a word with you. 

It's impossible to bend the cause and effect chain of the universe without adding extra energy somewhere. So how are you able to do that exactly without that energy being depended on a previous cause, and by what metric is that your "choice"?

Or to put it another way: How can you decide what thought to think before you have thought about it?
$C: I can't disagree with that!
$C: Is there an echo in here?
$C: They are thinking, just not of the same things as you.
$C: To overwrite a behaviour you need to have a reason.

If you rewind time, the reason remains the same, unless you tell me that you did so to check possible outcomes. Then I can truly reconsider the options. Otherwise you call the universe deterministic while you, as part of that universe” are not by virtue of being able to go back in time and change different things or not.
$C: Crossing the street:

Thinking->Options->Viable options->Weigh them more->Act

Crossing the street in protest of blindfolds:

Thinking->Options->Viable options->Weigh them more->I know which is the right one-> Apply “external” reason->Act on the “lesser” option
$C: > If you rewind time, the reason remains the same

That's my entire point, the reason is part of the input into the computer you carry in your head. Same input, same output.

I think we're losing sight of the original comment this is about:

> Not to be a party pooper but I don't think I follow this one. They would believe that their road safety check was also predestined, no?

Basically the universe can be predestined, and checking, or not, before crossing the road is just another part of that with no real branching choice involved on a per situation basis.
