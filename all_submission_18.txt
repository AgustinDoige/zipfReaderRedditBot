I work in a kitchen. You have no idea how many people say 'You look like the guy from ratatouille'. Every damn minute.

$C: Send picture to Disney... Get role for live action Ratatouille.
$C: Linguiiineeeeee!
$C: Cut out a silhouette of a rat with black construction paper and tape it on both side(inside) of your hat =P 
$C: Have you tried not looking like him? 
$C: You should apply at Disney Land to work in a Restaurant there xD
$C: I showed just the picture to my wife and didn't say anything. She just says "ratatouille."


$C: You look more like the guy from ratatouille than the guy from ratatouille looks like the guy from ratatouille 
$C: hey, you look like the guy from ratatouille
$C: Just embrace it and say that you are the guy from Ratatouille.
$C: Protip: every couple hours, randomly make a spastic motion with an arm or a hand.  If someone notices, just kinda smile and play it off.  Alternate between a hat with a rat silhouette and one without.  Mumble to yourself just out of earshot of your coworkers.  Really sell the whole thing.  Then, after a year or so, just stop. Make no mention of it ever again
$C: It would help if you stopped hiding rats under your toque
$C: I suggest you buy [this hat](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/b0/46/fc/b046fc5329f6c5a943310078da7132b5--adult-halloween-halloween-.jpg)

$C: [Fixed](https://imgur.com/gallery/ZhafVex) 

Edit: thanks for the gold. That‚Äôs two days in a row I‚Äôve been gilded for shitty mobile photoshopping 
$C: [Side by side comparison](https://imgur.com/a/vKSw0Aa)

He has born to play the role!!
$C: You may look like the guy from ratatouille but you‚Äôre also cute, so you have that going for you which is nice.
$C: Next time tell them: "It's Alfredo Linguine you filthy casual."
$C: Unless I see under your hat I'm not buying it.
$C: You should put a fake (stuffed plush-toy) rat under your hat and when they say you look like him.... take your hat off for a second to show your rat.
$C: I saw the thumbnail before I read the title, and my first thought was, "He looks like the guy from *Ratatouille*.
$C: You look like the guy from Ratatouille.
$C: But is your favorite dish to cook ratatouille though?
$C: You look like the guy from Ratatouille.
$C: You look like the guy from ratatouille 
$C: *angry French* LINGUINI
$C: Fun fact: Pixar used a photo of you when creating Ratatouille.
$C: I'm going to bed now. Got work at 8 in the morning. It was a pleasure reading your comments. goodnight! x
$C: Keep a stuffed animal rat under your hat. Embrace the meme and they have no power over you. 
$C: FOR THE LAST TIME, it's ratatouille's MONSTER!! 
$C: Trust me, by looking at you I have a relatively good idea how often you get that comparison 
$C: Hey, you look like Ryan Stiles......At least a younger one.
$C: You look like the guy from ratatouille.
$C: And sir I have to concur with them
$C: Man, I looked on the picture firstly and thought "this guy looks deadly similiar to the guy from that funny cartoon " and than I read the title. You got me :)
$C: You should embrace it...put like a cutout of the rat on the inside and out a little backlight...it'll bring customers...I garuntee it. 
$C: You are pretty cute, and I like your hair.  Coming from a fellow ginger
$C: You look like the guy from Ratatouille

$C: At least if you go to comic con you already have a cosplay. 
$C: You look like the guy from numberphile.
$C: You have no idea how much you look like the guy from Ratatouille.
$C: [Not as much as this guy](https://i.imgur.com/dL4e6Dw.jpg)
$C: I mean, for good reason. 
$C: Yeah you‚Äôre cute 
$C: You look like that guy from ratatouille!!

$C: Grow a beard. I guarantee you'll look like Action Bronson.
$C: You look like the guy from ratatouille. 
$C: I‚Äôm a redhead that used to work in a bakery. One day I made the stupid mistake of dubbing myself the Ginger Bread Man. Needless to say it stuck for years
$C: What is this, a crossover episode?

$C: Hey, You look like the guy from Ratatouille 
$C: [deleted]
$C: You look like the guy from ratatouille

$C: Quite a cutie!
$C: I get how annoying that is after the bazillionth time, but... damn. It's like they used you to create the dude from ratatouille
$C: I think Disney might owe you some money.
$C: This is crazy.  Vox told me only Latinos worked in the kitchen. 
$C: This guy fucks. 
$C: you need a stuffed animal to keep under that hat
$C: Reveal what's under your hat
$C: Did you start working in a kitchen because you look like the guy from Ratatouille?
$C: It's not nice to say someone looks like a rat.
$C: Haha. I looked at the picture without reading the description and thought, ‚Äúwow..he looks like the guy from ratatouille. Maybe they are making it into a Broadway show.‚Äù Hehe 
$C: A share a similar problem, except complete strangers say I look like clay from 13 Reasons why. 
$C: The guy from Ratatouille looks like YOU.

$C: Come on, man,  Just lift up your hat real quick.
$C: I was literally just watching the movie when I saw the post!!
$C: Someone already created a meme out of this and I saw it on Facebook. They‚Äôre quick. 
$C: Get a job at Disney
$C: ... take off the hat.
$C: Is this me or does this guy look like the chef from ratatouille?

$C: You definitely do! I bet that's why you work in a kitchen. Cause you love it 
$C: At least they don't say "You look like the rat from Ratatouille..." 
$C: Put a small plush Remy on your hat!
$C: Looking at the thumbnail before reading the subject, I thought I was looking at a post from r/cosplay.
$C: Thought this was a cosplay post.
$C: Really do though.
$C: You need to get a small toy rat that will velcro stick to your shoulder.  
$C: Shave your head.
$C: Damn you should wear a hairnet. You know if someone finds a hair there won‚Äôt be a question who it belongs to.
$C: Remy is obviously hiding in that guys hat.
$C: But you do!
$C: LINGUIIIIIIIIIIINIIIIIIII!
$C: Look at it this way man, it's not going to stop unless either you completely change your look with a drastic haircut or something or the better option, you straight embrace that shit and put a picture of a godamn rat on your chef's hat or get a rat lapel pin or something. At least that way, you'll get a good laugh or chuckle out of people!
$C: Hey, you're the one who got a job in a restaurant that has that uniform.  I'm thinking you like looking like the guy from Ratatouille 
$C: The real question is, ‚Äúare you the guy from Ratatouille?‚Äù
$C: Let's do this thing!
$C: You look a little like a young 'C. Montgomery Burns' 

I meant that in the best way.
$C: hey how come you're taking a selfie and not cleaning that wall behind you
$C: Anyone tried to remove your "hat thing" ?
$C: Ratatouille, you look like that guy on reddit!
$C: Congratulations.  Now the average is every 35 seconds instead of every minute.
$C: Always nice to see pictures off sets, surprised Ratatouille is getting a live-action adaptation so early!
$C: I get this with Mr Bean. Not sure which is worse ... You're not alone
$C: Could do a lot worse.  like looking like the rat from ratatouille. :(
$C: I hear you, in the southpark episode humancentipad or something like that... there is an apple tech, name Rothgar, my wife, her entire family, and my friends all say it's me. I'm even in IT just not Apple.
$C: Cut your hair then.
$C: Hey... You look like the guy from Ratatouille 
$C: You definitely need to put a little mouse model in your hat with a led to make a silhouette. up there...


$C: At least you don‚Äôt look like that guy from the /u/warlizard gaming forum 
$C: Cut the crap and share a pic of the rat
$C: So is the rat under the hat?

$C: You look like the guy from ratatouille

$C: You look like the guy from ratatouille. 
$C: You look like the guy from ratatouille
$C: Maybe try to stop looking exactly like him and you won't have this problem!
$C: Lift up the hat!
$C: at least you look like the cook and not the rat
$C: I hope your go-to pick-up line is "do you want to see my little chef?"
$C: Hey man! You probably don‚Äôt get this a lot, but you look like the guy from ratatouille!
$C: Omg he looks like the guy from Ratatouille
$C: Actually you do lol
$C: How do you know people aren't actually comparing your cooking skill to Linguini as a subtle hint rather than your appearance?

  
Joking aside, I think Linguini should be your Halloween costume. Buy an actual plush doll or toy of Remy. Put Remy under a chef's toque blanche along with a decent bright light. That way people can see the shadow of Remy through the toque blanche.
$C: Linguini
$C: You look like the guy from that movie with the chef and the mouse
$C: Hey, you look like that guy from ratatouille!
$C: One of the best movies ever. You should take it as the compliment it is.

$C: Well when the hat fits! üòÑ
$C: u/Rampzz
$C: Take off ur hat linguini! 
$C: It‚Äôs not even anything to do with the fact that you‚Äôre a ginger chef, you legit just look a lot like him lol
$C: Does the hat.... do anything?
$C: For your boss to actually make you wear those fucking paper hats.... he must be the worlds biggest asshole. 
$C: ITS FUCKING LINGUINI 
$C: Bet u cook a hella good meal
$C: You should just get a haircut, man.
$C: Hey! You look like the guy from Ratatouille!

$C: You know, you kind of look like the guy from Ratatouille.
$C: Lol seeing the picture that was my first thought before I even read the title.
$C: Oh hey, you look like the guy from ratatouille!
$C: Hey, you look like the guy from Ratatouille.
$C: Dude, has anyone ever told you you look like the dude from Ratatouille?!
$C: We all know the truth, So why hide Remy?
$C: The way I see it, you have two choices. 

1. Embrace the Rats. 

2. Grow weirdly trimmed facial hair and cover your arms in full tattoo sleeves and be like all the other edgy chefs out there right now. 

OK, 3. Find a middle ground and be you. <-- choose this option!

$C: You look like the guy from ratatouille
$C: You should print out a little paper rat n tape it inside your hat
$C: The rat or the guy?
$C: I refuse to believe that you did not intentionally cultivate that look.  This is cosplay.  
$C: I look/ed like a character from Toy Story. 

I feel you. 
$C: Honestly I would consider a career change if I were you, it's never going to end.
$C: I glanced at the thumbnail, said to myself... "that looks like the guy from ratatouille" and then read the title.
$C: The guy from Ratatouille looks like you.
$C: You look even more Jewish than him
$C: Just store a fake mouse under your hat and people will love it.
$C: Yes you are. LOL 
$C: So where is Little Chef? 
$C: You look like the guy from Ratatouille.
$C: Hey, did anyone tell you that you look like that guy from Ratatouille?
$C: Holy shit, you look like the guy from ratatouille
$C: Just for shingles, you should have a silhouette of a rat taped underneath your toque. When the light shines directly on it you can see it. 
$C: Dude apply at Disneyland. They‚Äôll take care of you. You would probably end up working at a nice restaurant there. 
$C: Dude  


Go get a rat plushie  


And then clip him to your hair under your hat  


And whenever anyone says that, just lift your hat, give them a pointed look, and walk away  


own that shit.  

$C: At least people are saying you look like "the guy from Ratatouille" and not "Ratatouille"
$C: You look like the guy from Ratatouille.
$C: At least that's your Halloween costume sorted... every year... forever.
$C: Just here to be a part of this weirdly popular monument
$C: Well you look exactly like him! Lol
$C: OMG you look like the guy from ratatouille! 
$C: Look who‚Äôs gonna make it to the front page in r/PhotoshopBattles 
$C: Oh man. I am so sorry. I honestly saw the thumbnail first and thought "Awesome Ratatouille cosplay!" And then I read the title. On the plus side, Front Page for that thing you hate!
$C: Own it . Put a toy rat inside the hat and make it kinda see-through 
$C: You look like the guy from Ratatouille.
$C: I mean it's true, people aren't lying
$C: Sue Disney for stealing your likeness!
$C: [removed]
$C: Hey , grow or draw you a small mustache everybody will ask you why you were tanned in Grand budapest hotel
$C: You look like the guy from ratatouille.
$C: Little do we know he has a rat under his hat
$C: You look like the guy from Ratatouille.
$C: I dunno how'd you do it comfortably, but man, if you could somehow secure a little toy mouse to your hair under your hat, you'd be SO popular with kids.

Embrace this!
$C: [deleted]
$C: Disney would hire you in a minute!
$C: Step 1: File lawsuit to Disney

Step 2: Profit
$C: And??? Are you or not?
$C: I looked like a US president when I was a young adult. If you want it to stop, embrace it. Start introducing yourself as Linguini. Put the word Ratatouille on your uniform. Make everyone *else* tired of hearing about Ratatouille.
$C: I have a cousin in Mexico that looks like the rat from  Ratatouille 
$C: Open up a restaurant in Disney where people can watch you cook ! Make bank!

$C: do you need to wear the hat ? 
$C: You have your cosplay and Halloween costume on lockdown
$C: Hey, ratatouille look like the guy from you
$C: Even if you didn't work in a kitchen I would say that.
$C: You look like the guy from Ratatouille.
$C: Hey you look like you have a rodent in your hat
$C: Dear god, you do! The hat doesn't help :)

ANYONE CAN COOK!
$C: Just get a toy mouse from the movie and keep it under your hat

Embrace it 
$C: You don‚Äôt really, it‚Äôs just that your hair color is spot on
$C: Put a hair net on ya fluffy bastard.

Also you look like the guy from ratatouille  
$C: Looking at this photo, that's not surprising at all for me. 
$C: hey, you look like the guy from ratatouille
$C: Is your food as good as that food looked in the movie?
$C: You do though
$C: 1536 at the one hour mark
$C: Maybe it‚Äôs true?
$C: Ok... release little chef
$C: I bet there's a fucking rat under that hat.
$C: Stop bringing your pet rat to work
$C: Well grow a beard or somethin'.  Got-damn!
$C: Grow a mustache
$C: Who dared downvote this!? it's damn adorable.
$C: Take off the hat.
$C: Technically, wouldn't it be that the guy from Ratatouille looks like you?

Either way, I agree. 
$C: You have a rash?
$C: grow a beard. done.
$C: I would put a little mouse sillhouette in my hat if I were you. 
$C: Doesn't it get you laid?
$C: Just get a pet rat and lean into it. 
$C: Own it, OP. The resemblance is uncanny.
$C: Hey, you look like that guy from ratatouille 
$C: can you blame them?
$C: If they sell a Plush version of the rat and it‚Äôs small you should get one and have it under your hat.  (Or any small stuffed mouse [cat]toy).  Then when someone says that to you pick up the hat to show them!
$C: You should tape a silhouette of a rat in your hat so it can been seen against the light. Then deny it‚Äôs there.
$C: You look like the guy from Ratatouille.
$C: Well to be fair... 
$C: Dude, run with it. Draw the silhouette of a rat on that hat.
$C: Just go with it, you'll end up with a hot french chef for a girlfriend and a Rat for a best friend.
$C: I do have an idea, a lot.
$C: The resemblance is insanely uncanny! That‚Äôs awesome! 
$C: "That's disgusting; look like a fawkin' lizard man."  Tony Montana
$C: Linguini is that you?
$C: hey, you look like the guy from ratatouille


$C: Seems like a good way to find someone to love.
$C: It's uncanny 
$C: U can't blame them for that can't u
$C: Just lift up the hat to let us be sure.
$C: I'd hate to do the health inspection in your kitchen.
$C: linguini!!!
$C: You totally need to lean into it. Get a plastic rat to go under your hat...
$C: Get a button that says I know and just point to it.
$C: What is your job in the kitchen? 
$C: That‚Äôs hilarious ü§£. Btw did you know you look like that guy from Ratatouille. 
$C: It's incredible. You alone justify a life action adaptation.
$C: Hey aren't you the guy from ratatouille?
$C: Well I don't know what to say now that won't annoy you...
$C: Well you really, really do. It‚Äôs crazy. 
$C: Well..i mean...you really do
$C: If it bothers you, why continue to look like the guy from Ratatouille, then? 
Could always change your appearance some to not look like an exact replica.
$C: I've never seen that movie, so to me you just look like a guy! :) 
$C: Shave your head. Problem solved. 
$C: That hat is doing nothing to stop your hair falling into the food
$C: I look like mclovin so dude I understand the struggle so much I charge 1$ for the catch phrase 
$C: You guys wear the dumb hats there?
$C: You look like zucc
$C: You kinda of look like the guy in ratatouille. Do you cooƒ∑ as good?
$C: Rat cooking movie guy? Is that you?
$C: You look like the guy from Rataouille
$C: Damn you do look like the guy from Ratatouille 
$C: In their defense, you do.
$C: So don't be offended. You are really look alike on him. Do those your customers ask you "How's your pet rat doing?" No? 
How's your pet rat doing?
$C: Wasn‚Äôt the guy in ratatouille dead the whole time?
$C: holy cow you look like that guy from ratatouille
$C: U look like that dude from that movie w the rat in it.
$C: hey, you guy the like look ratatouille from
$C: Why and how are you wearing your hat like that ? The point is to have most of your hair under it.
$C: Could be worse. They could have said "You **c**ook like the guy from Ratatouille."
$C: Well you're just so damn adorable!
$C:  hey, you look like the guy from ratatouille 
$C: Welcome to hell.
$C: Young Ryan Stiles.
$C: oh, wow. You look like the guy from ratatouille
$C: Damn. You really do
$C: When did Ratatouille get such realistic graphics?
$C: You were born in the kitchen, molded by it.
$C: You do tho
$C: LINGUIIIIIINEEEE!
$C: What's under your hat
$C:  People was wrong. You are EXACTLY the guy from ratatouille.
$C: You just need to perfect that 'The rat is controlling me' act and you could have the best time at cosplay events.
$C: Choose a different haircut then. 
$C: The rat?
$C: Well until I see whether or not you've got a blue mouse under your hat, it's either or. Schrodinger's chef.
$C: Do you have a little chef?
$C: I can see the rat hiding in there...
$C: Well. You do
$C: I am sorry you do but you look so adorable
$C: Hey, you look like that guy from ratatouille 
$C: I am spartacus
$C: r/roastme?
$C: /r/KitchenConfidential
$C: In their defense you looks like you crawled right out of Paris.

I don't know how many children or in the restaurant but maybe you couldn't give them a little something by putting a little stuffed Mouse beneath your sheffs hat.

I mean my suggestion is just owning it
$C: I mean, you don't have to keep your hair similar to his and I'm betting there are chef hats with other designs than plain white, so I'm guessing it doesn't bother you too much
$C: hey, you look like the guy from ratatouille
$C: You dirty rat, you killed my brother
$C: You should put a stuff toy rat on your head and in your hat and just take it off whenever someone tell you that.
$C: 4k is getting crazy. This scene from Ratatouille looks like real life.
$C: Yeah but you really do.
$C: If you get to bang Colette, worth it. 
$C: Wear a wizards hat to work tomorrow. Might be a different day.
$C: That movie has ruined your life.
$C: Didn't you get the memo that skinny redheads can no longer be chefs without being called the guy from Ratatouille lmao
$C: You look like the guy from ratatouille.
$C: Great cospaly üëç

$C: Rat, you look guy the like from heyatouille
$C: You look like Scott Tenorman.
$C: Did you start working in the kitchen  before the movie or after.Depending on your answer you maybe in store for a lot of money if you were not mentioned in the movie cast list
$C: You just know he's got a rat under there.
$C: Welp, I saw the image before the title and my 1st thought was ratatouille so... yeah you look like the guy from ratatouille
$C: I looked at the thumbnail and didn't read anything and that was the first thing that came to mind.
$C: So, are you ?
$C: Well on the bright side you can go to any cosplay convention without changing out of those work clothes 
$C: Do they ever say hey! You look hi af ron weasley from avengers now make me a pancake.
$C: shave your hair?
$C: Shut up garbage boy
$C: Ratatouille live action? When does it come out?

$C: I guess that's better than being compared to Ron Weasley.
$C: ANYONE CAN COOK
$C: You look more like the guy from ratatouille
$C: You should put a plastic rat in your hat
$C:  You know, I gotta say something, if I could say something here. You look familiar. Joey, look at this guy's mug.

$C: No hairnet?!
$C: Hey OP! Did you know you look like the guy in Ratatouille?
$C: Take off your hat then o.o
$C: Whats the point of the hat. Just for decoration?
$C: Get a stuffed rat and keep it under your hat.  Next time someone makes the comment, tip your hat to them.

Another option:  Go get a job at DisneyWorld's new Ratatouille restaurant in Epcot.  Use it to your advantage!

$C: "this guy here looks like the guy from ratatouille!" I said to myself even before reading what you wrote! 
$C: Step 1: Clip small stuffed rat to the hair on top of your head.

Step 2: Place hat over rat.

Step 3: Wait for someone to tell you you look like the guy from Ratatouille.

Step 4: Take off hat and scratch your head thoughtfully while scrunching face, and say, "Do I?"

Step 5: Profit
$C: op, please apply at disney chain restuarant and keep us updated
$C: Dude just own it. Keep a stuffed mouse under there for people who ask, they'll love it.
$C: embrace it in grace - attach a fake rat to you!!
$C: Embrace it, put R√©my on the side of your hat.
$C: My wife: "He looks young enough to have seen Ratatouille before choosing a career. This is on him."
$C: Are you him though?
$C: Where is the rat? üòã
$C: You don‚Äôt look like a rodent to me.
$C: That movie is old enough you knew what you were getting into. 
$C: yes you do ;D
$C: Yeah, I'd grow that beard out
$C: You look like the guy from ratatouille 
$C: Holy shit I have a friend who exactly looks like you. When my other friend met that friend, he said to him "You look like Linguini from Ratatouille". You're not alone, stay strong. 
$C: It‚Äôs because you are that guy from ratatouille. 
$C: I think you are owed some royalties for Pixar having used your likeness.
$C: Embrace. That. Shit. üêÄ
$C: Has anyone ever told you that you look like the man in ratatouille
$C: What do you expect?
$C: Everyone can cook!
$C: This movie deserves to be praised! 
$C: Linguini 
$C: Normally I‚Äôd say how I‚Äôd personally take that as an awesome compliment; however I can definitely see why that would be an extraordinary pain in the ass.
$C: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/dvd/Disney/Images/rat4.gif

wheres your co-worker üòò
$C: Tu ressembles au gars de Ratatouille.
$C: You should get a face tattoo. 

$C: Well you do look like him big fella
$C: As a fellow redhead, people often tell me I look like whatever redhead they see the most even if we don‚Äôt really look alike. However, you really do look like Alfredo.
$C: Dude, I don't wanna spoil anything, but you may be the heir to a once 5 star restaurant. You should get one of those DNA kits. They have them pretty cheap on amazon nowadays. Good Luck!

Edit: (the look on your face said that you would truly, deeply appreciate some jokes.)
$C: "Hey you look like that Ratatouille guy!"

"I know Dave, you told me an hour ago"
$C: But...you do. Take it as a compliment! 
$C: You look like that guy from ratatouille
$C: Is Disney doing a live action for Ratatouille finally? This looks like a promotional picture.
$C: Put a small LED light in the hat w/ a rat cutout to make the silhouette and make a name badge that just says Yes, I know.
$C: embrace it, hes a beloved character. 
$C: Just say back to them "you look like ratapoopie"
$C: If only they made a live action version.
$C: >get a rat.
>bring rat to work.
>when someone says that you look like ratatouille guy bring out the rat and say "I am the guy from ratatouille."
$C: how many?
$C: You should get a Remi plush and keep it under your hat.
$C: [You need to enhance your hat!](http://www.papercraftsquare.com/ratatouille-french-rat-remy-ver-2-free-papercraft-download.html)
$C: You did this to yourself ratatouille man
$C: Hey, I didn't read the post but going off the picture, did you know that you look like the guy from that movie with the rat?
$C: It's been years since I've seen it. Just went and googled.

Holy crap, it literally looks like an animated version of you. 
$C: Before even reading the tiltle I was thinking that you look like the ratatouille guy
$C: Hey you look like the guy from ratatouille!
$C: You‚Äôre not fooling anyone, Mr. Sheeran. 
$C: OP, what food do you cook? 
$C: You look like the guy in Ratatouille wtf
$C: Ok give up the rat!
$C: Lmmmmaaaaaoooo.

$C: Perhaps you should find a pretty French chef? Also, despite their reputation, rats do make wonderful loving pets. 
$C: Looks like you need to embrace it and apply to become a cast member at Disney.
$C: Do they ever pull your hat up to check for a mouse? 
$C: Where's the mouse??? Put up or shut up.
$C: You came to the wrong neighborhood with this gripe, friendo.
$C: Aww but you‚Äôre so f-omg adorable.

$C: Nice cosplay bro
$C: I‚Äôve never seen ratatouille so i had to look it up and holy shit you look like that guy from ratatouille. 
$C: Actually you jist look like a ginger making souless food.
$C: Anybody ever crazy enough to think ratatouille and leave cause of potential rats? 
$C: Lift up your hat...
$C: Well, don‚Äôt make it so easy!!!!
$C: You should tell them it was a true story. That'll mess with their head and make them question their meal choices at the same time.
$C: TO BE FAIR....
$C: Whatever else you do, learn how to cook the big dishes from ratatouille. You have a gimmick, roll with it. In fact I have a video for you right here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCX0AfBseQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCX0AfBseQ)
$C: You decided to work in a kitchen to pull this off, didn't you?
$C: So, what's your signature dish?  You know, to challenge Bobby Flay.
$C: Just deal with it Alfredo. 
$C: You look like that guy from ratatouille.


$C: Its the nose and hair.
$C: I would just stand and squint at your hat
$C: my god lol
$C: I try not to annoy people that look like notable figures by instead saying something like, 'Hey has anybody ever told you (insert notable figure here) looks a lot like you!'.... i.e comparing the figure to them, NOT them to the figure. 
*edit for grammar
$C: r/roastme

$C: You have a rat under your hat right now, don't you?

DON'T YOU LIE TO ME!
$C: Embrace it
$C: The difference is, that you have more than one rat in the kitchen.
$C: thats all fine and good, but...*can you make toad-in-the-hole?*
$C: Do your rat know how to fry eggs ?
$C: Have fun with it. Think of clever come backs.  Make the person realize how many people say that to you and how unoriginal they are in a fun way that gets them outta their bullshit. 
$C: You look like the guy from Ratatouille 
$C: You really look like the guy from ratatouille. Lol
$C: Hey ... you look like that guy.    Never mind never mind...

$C: I bet you make a spectacular  linguine 
$C: Now go and get a French woman in bed and show her who is pulling the strings! üê≠
$C: My weakness for redheaded boys says no. My love for Ratatoullie says yes. 
$C: I got a grey-furred pet rat that really likes cheese if you wanna complete your cosplay. Gotta warn you though, if you use a nice smelling shampoo he'll likely try to eat your scalp for a good 20 minutes.
$C: Hahahaha sorry for your loss. F
$C: The guy from ratatouille looks like you.
$C: Well I, for one, think you look nothing like a rat.
$C: Do people lift your hat looking for a rat?
$C: That's kind of mean, but I guess I do see the resemblance to that rat. 
$C: Dude I can even see the rat through your hat.
$C: You should stop looking like the guy from Ratatouille.
$C: I‚Äôm sorry. 
$C: Hey you look like the guy from ratatouille.
$C: *LINGUINIIII !?!*

$C: Click a picture with Ratatouille and pet a mouse. You'd be a living legend, good sir. 
$C: Well, you do
$C: You should buy a stuffed rat to carry around and wink at them and say shhhhh
$C: You should keep a stuffed rat (or a real rat!) under the hat for when people say that
$C: Yes, but how many ask you to show your "mouse"? 
$C: Well that's an easy Halloween costume
$C: XDDDDD
$C: Did you work in a kitchen before the movie came out? If so, sue for likeness rights. If not, you knew what you were getting into.
$C: The only solution is to put an LED and a mouse silhouette in your hat.

$C: I looked at the picture before reading the title and thought ‚Äúhey he looks like the guy from Ratatouille.‚Äù
$C: What good does that hat do if it's not catching hair?  Maybe it's just to hide the rat.
$C: I didn‚Äôt even read the title of this thread and literally said ‚Äúthat dude looks like the dude from Ratatouille!‚Äù

$C: Turn them Lemons into Lemonade!

Get a job as a Chef at Disney Land Paris...
$C: You either embrace it or get annoyed by it. 

If your boss lets you,  turn it into a cosplay. It will change people's comments.  Tape a picture of the mouse the movie on the hat. 

Comments will go from you look like him to Omg, amazing cosplay.  Your boss needs to give you a raise. 
$C: Just show up to comic con in your work uniform. Instant cosplay
$C: Well take the hat off then. Pretty simple. 
$C: Best movie ever

$C: I hope that's a compliment
$C: Its okay, people used to say i looked like sadness when i had a blue bob
$C: Ratatouille: The Movie - CONFIRMED!
$C: so maybe use this to your advantage? get a stuffed rat (or real one depending on your mood) and put it under your hat for when someone says that.
$C: Indeed. Where's the rat btw?
$C: They probably based the character off of you!
$C: Can confirm, thought u were from rattitoutittie
$C: I thought you were a guy from the kkk. 
$C: You remind of someone 
$C: I would expect a call from Disney any second now. At the rate they are doing live action adaptations your turn to shine must be 2019 or 2010 for sure. 
$C: You like hair in your food cause that's how you get hair in your food. Would legit be thrown out of any kitchen I've been in. Cover your damn hair and give the rat a piece of cheese for me.

$C: That why I love Disney. 
$C: Poor bastard...
$C: Calling the health department 
$C: *shines a flashlight on your hat*

$C: Hey you look like that guy from ratatouille.

$C: "That's Gusteau's boy!"
$C: This is what my girlfriend said without any context...‚ÄùThe guy from ratatouille that let the mouse sit on his head, Hahaha it‚Äôs because of the red hair and chef shirt. He looks like the chef 5 years later when he doesn‚Äôt get any recognition anymore from everyone loving the mouse so his restaurant is closed for letting animals in the kitchen... He then goes to work in a diner and frequently does coke to feel the same emotions he did when the mouse controlled him to make the dish for the food critic‚Äù

Disney should be paying your royalties.
$C: Well they are not wrong are they
$C: You should unintentionally post this in r/cosplay. 
$C: I get "Did anyone ever tell you that you look like Mark Hamill? " all of the time. I decided to do something with the fluke resemblance. See www.imflukeskywalker.com   +1 for you
$C: HA! Got your tog! 
$C: "Hey, this guy kinda looks like the guy from Ratatouille."

$C: You can't control what other people are going to say, but you can choose how you react to it. You could choose to be annoyed by this, or you could embrace it. I think the later would make everyone happier.

Why not get a Ratatouille toy to put on your shoulder or hide under your hat? People would eat that up.

$C: I didn't read the full title, looked at your pic and though, "Are they making a live action Ratatouille?"

You should get a fake mouse and have it peeking out from under your hat.
$C: Well if you put on a hat or hair net that actually served a purpose instead of a hat that doesn‚Äôt do anything other than make you look like a Pixar character then maybe you wouldn‚Äôt get the comparison as often.
$C: How do you manage to keep that kitchen napkin on your head?
$C: So there‚Äôs a rat in your hat ?

His personal motto is that anyone can cook, and is prone to producing recipes with unusual flairs. He was the youngest chef in history to obtain a 5-star restaurant, and was among the finest chefs worldwide.

$C: You should find a small rat figurine or plushie and keep it under your hat. When someone says something in reference, just stare at them and take it off slowly. Don't break eye contact. 
Or a line your hat with LED and have an outline of a rat. Either way there is so much potential here.
$C: But do you work in a French kitchen?
$C: You should put a toy rat under your chef hat for fun, maybe people will see the shadow of the rat in your hat.

I have to say that it works wonders for me: when I meet famous people at conventions I make sure to ask them something that isn't the same repeated shit. I can tell when they act surprised at the question or have to think about it

$C: Got a rat in yo hat?
$C: if i had a dollar for every time someone asked me that. i could buy a Fucking talking rat chef 
$C: Not more than 60 I'd guess
$C: The voice actor for Linguine is my uncle!! They semi model the cartoon after the actual person, at least for facial features and manerisms. It‚Äôs funny how much you look like the character, and also how much my uncle looks like the character, and yet you two look nothing alike!

$C: Holy shit.... Rick!?!?
$C: Haha, they're not wrong you know. 
$C: Showed my wife the pic. She said that looks like the Ratatouille guy. Yeah. You win. 
$C: Just showed my wife this pic with no context. She asked if they were making a live action Ratatouille. 
$C: You should put a little mouse shadow inside your hat!! Haha
$C: Cut it out kid it's movie time
$C: LPT: make a joke about it by pretending you know what they're talking about then say a line from a different character.

"I keeled a maan, wit *ZIS* thamb!"

"No, not that guy!"

Ect.


$C: I once had a waitress that looked like a young slightly rounder Denise Richards.

My girlfriend at the time and I were debating whether or not we should say anything.

THE ANSWER IS NO.

They know. They *always* know. 
$C: Just ask them if they want to meet a Ratatouille lookalike and then tell them he is actually in the kitchen.
$C: Just say "I AM him."
$C: Had to google it, holy shit, sorry dude.
$C: Hey you look like the guy from Numberphile
$C: Very handsome üòä
$C: The hat looked pointy in the thumbnail, so my mind went to the wizard from The Last Unicorn.. Just me I guess.
$C: You look like that guy from that movie about a rat controlling the cook. 
$C: Disney is making live action movies of their animations.. seriously dude. Get a headshot. Send it in. :) You'll be set for life.
$C: Well. You do üòÅüëå
$C: OK people, quit sell telling this young man to go work for Disney. He doesn't have a soul to sell.

I'm a redhead, so this is fine. 
$C: Holy shist
$C: #Praise be to the newest Champion of Reddit, u/zombi3123!

[Let us not forget the Champions of yore...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChampionsOfReddit/)
$C: You look like the guy from Ratatouille and my ex-boyfriend combined! Embrace it :3
$C: Take your hat off. Show us the varmint.
$C: As a red headed (ex) Chef also, your hats not fully open, is it clamped onto your hair? I could never get those paper bastards to stay on.
$C: Own it. Keep a little cartoony rat peeking out of your pocket, for and just wink and say shhhh if someone puts 2 and 2 together
$C: REALLY not surprised...

$C: My son works in a kitchen, but with blond hair and glasses. Otherwise, twinsies!

$C: OMG HE DOES
$C: You look like that guy from ratatouille 
$C: Hey! You look like that guy from Ratatouille
$C: Oh wow, the resemblance is uncanny.
$C: I wouldn't say that. I have never seen ratatouille the movie. You don't look like the stuff I have on my plate.
$C: Pretend you don't know what Ratatoullie is OR pretend you're filming for a live action Ratatouille.

Both of these would produce wild reactions
$C: Take your hat off so we can see the rat

$C: Has anybody tried removing his hat?
To see if there is a rat inside?

$C: Could somebody please photoshop the rat on his gora?
$C: Put a silhouette of a rat in your hat
$C: You look like that guy from Ratatouille!
$C: But do you make soul food???
$C: What's your rate for birthday parties?
$C: Well... you do look like him! üòÇ
$C: You're no chef, you have a paper cilinder on your head! 
$C: And they check your hat to see the rat on your head. 
$C: Is anyone else tired of seeing this guy's face everytime they go on this week's top?
$C: RemindMe! 5 minuets ‚Äúhashtag ‚Äú
$C: I'd take that over what I get at least twice a week... 

"You look like someone famous..."

"Oh yeah? Who?" (I know who)

"I can't think of his name..."

"Adrien Brody"

"That's it! But from when he was in that one movie..."

"The Pianist" 

"YES!" 

The movie he played an AIDS patient in. Cool, thanks. 
$C: Mate, you knew this going in. The movie came out before you entered culinary school. 
Embrace it 
$C: Just own it dude, like the Polynesian guy at Costco that sings songs from Moana to little kids :D 
$C: Twist - instead of a rat in the hat you have a gerbil up your shorts.
$C: hey, you look like the guy from ratatouille
$C: Hey, would you like to be apart of the live action ratatouille movie?
$C: üî™
$C: You look like the guy from ratatouille
$C: Hey you look just like the guy from ratatouille
$C: Well, they have a point
$C: Wow, I feel your pain, but I think I'd have to ask myself, even if it was for health reasons...lmao
$C: They‚Äôre not wrong 
$C: Can you show us whats under the chief hat?
$C: What's he hiding under his hat? Hmm...
$C: You look like a guy from ratatouille.
$C:  Linguini!
$C: You look really cute! Hmu
$C: I see him as vigo's son from john wick
$C: Keep a real live rat under your hat and surprise everyone who makes that comment
$C: IS THAT A RAT I SMELL????
$C: Thank you Linguine, very cool
$C: Go blonde! Might help
$C: Hey, that dude looks like the chef from Ratatouille!
$C: You look like the guy from ratatouille

$C: Have yoe ever puked in the kitchen? Work or at home?
$C: You look like the guy from ratatouille
$C: Did you know you look like the guy from Ratatouille?
$C: does your work have social media policy
$C: Guys does anyone else think he looks like the guy from ratatouille?????? 
$C: Omg...do you know who you look like!?! 
$C: U/titletoimagebot

$C: shave your head
$C: Is there a rat under your hat ? =))
$C: Why are redditors always ginger and incel
$C: Do I know you man ? Have you seen Ratatouille?
$C: That guy from ratatouille looks like you 
$C: Hey, you look like that guy from ratatouille.
$C: Dislikes notoriety for looking like Disney character.

Posts picture about it on Reddit.

Logic.
$C: Grab them by the collar and bellow NO ONE SPEAKS TO RICK ASTLEY THAT WAY
$C: WOW, I can empathize with you /u/zombi3123. At my last restaurant job I got nicknamed "Linguini" on my third day, but I think you got me beat.
$C: You look the guy from Ratatouille
$C: You look like the guy from ratatouille!
$C: You look like the guy from ratatouille 
$C: You look like the guy from ratatouille.
$C: You look like the guy from ratatouille 
$C: WOW... my husband gets this comment a lot too, but you may have him beat!
$C: Very cute though 
$C: Then you shouldn't have dyed your hair that color
$C: Hey, you look like the mouse in ratatouille.
$C: You do
$C: It‚Äôs cuz u actually do.
$C: Sure, but you make 9.50/hour so what do they know? 
$C: Kind of? I never would have thought that if you didn't say it yourself
$C: >I work in a kitchen

Glad you didn't call yourself a chef.

That "hat" you have covering only 1/3rd of your hair is about as much use as a chocolate fireguard.

You look like you have about as much respect for hygiene as a worm infested North Korean soldier in a cardboard uniform.

Tell your boss (they're not a chef either, allowing you in that fancy dress costume) that I prefer my soup without ginger head pubes for garnish. 
$C: I can‚Äôt stop looking at your hat and am disappointed every time I look there 
$C: I guess I don't understand the point of that hat. It doesn't keep your hair from falling out and going in the food, all it does is make you look like a moron.

I spent years in hospitality and foods and have had to wear hats, aprons and even heard nets. This paper hat that doesn't even cover the entirety of your head makes no sense.
$C: Hey you look like that guy from Ratatouille
$C: You look like the guy from ratatouille
$C: You look like the guy from ratatouille
$C: you kinda look like that guy from Ratatouille
$C: Hey! You look like the guy from ratatouille!
$C: Holy fuck.....

You look like the guy from Ratatouille! 
$C: You look like that guy from ratatoille.

(Am I funny now?)
$C: You look like the guy from Ratatouille
$C: Hey you look like the guy from ratatouille!!
$C: Dude, that's awesome.
$C: Dude, that's awesome.
$C: Wait, can people see you through the hat?
$C: Guarantee there's a mouse in that hat.
$C: You look like the kid from The ‚ÄòBurbs
$C: Hey is that the guy from ratatouille?
$C: That's yo fault tho... You knew what you were getting into... Ratatouille guy!! üòÇüòÇ
$C: King Krule, dat you?
$C: Get a tat on your face and stop bitching ginger 
$C: DIEING. You‚Äôre the best!
$C: Omg your sexy.. bake me a dish so we can fuck ontop and get messy. Want to lick that face 
$C: hey, you look like the guy from ratatouille 
$C: You are the guy from ratatouille
$C: You look like the guy from ratatouille.
$C: Was hoping this was on r/roastme
$C: Dude you are extremely good looking.
$C: Every minute? Is your kitchen in the middle of Times Square?
$C: I legit thought you were a clan member for a second 
$C: [removed]
$C: Um, you look like you‚Äôre headed for a Klan meeting
$C: you look for me like a cunt tbh
$C: Title says chef hat says kkk member
$C: I hate that movie
$C: It's a compliment white bitch. You white people are same level of stupidity. 
$C: Does it suck being so fucking ugly that you're going to die alone and a virgin?
$C: Is ratattoullie a documentary about kitchen staff, sort of like "Pumping Iron" is about the inner workings of bodybuidling in the 70's?
$C: You look like the fucker who'll habitually cock up my starters, and I have to go over to help even though I'm balls deep into service and you're not being slammed; who'll call in "sick" for several consecutive Saturdays, but we keep on because you're soft as shite and secretly we love you because you're crap and young and can get the drugs.

Also, I'm watching Ratatouille tongiht.  Its my favourite food movie, and I've only seen it once because my memory is too fucking powerful and I remember fucking everything for about a decade.

*edited* downvoted by dweebs not in the biz.
$C: [deleted]
$C: ...or more likely get cease and desist.

>You look too much like one of our characters. Stop it.
$C: If don‚Äôt do the Disney thing, get a rat w/ a cage. You‚Äôre set for Halloween. Easy peasy.
$C: Or better: send picture and demand royalties for using your image. 
$C: Yeah, legit. If he's friendly and has worked in food for awhile, I wouldn't be surprised if they had him in a restaurant at Disney World/Land as Linguini. He wouldn't even need any real costuming done since he's a spot-on real life version.

And people would likely stop telling him he looks like the guy from Ratatoulie since that would be the point.
$C: My thoughts exactly.
$C: Yeah, good luck getting Patton Oswalt to sit on your head.
$C: It‚Äôs Pixar‚Äôs and they never tho live action movies  
$C: I could barely handle the animated cute rats I dont think I could watch the real ones ugh gross
$C: Omg remake starring him and Patton Oswalt please 
$C: Could you imagine what a great theme restaurant this could blossom into!?  Make it look like Linguini and Collette are cooking your meal, with help from Remy under the hat!  (...It does look like there is a Ratatouille theme restaurant in  Paris, but the decorations are oversized, making patrons seem rat-sized.)
$C: Agree!
$C: Profit??
$C: I mean his nose and hair already look like CG..
$C: [I've got his headshot ready for him](https://imgur.com/a/wVFKL87)
$C: He'll probably get sued for copyright infringement.
$C: Where would you get a real rat for the role? 
$C: Yeah, work on your theater singing voice. I see a Star In The Making! Have your people call my people!
$C:  Could not agree more 
$C: [nahh, this guy is the right choice](https://youtu.be/Y21eCsgyK4w) 
$C: This guy looks like the guy from that mouse movie from Pixar who cooks all the time. 
$C: Profit?!
$C: Or hear me out... just bring a rat into work and teach him how to cook?? 
$C: On ice?
$C: Disney stole his likeness! Sounds like he has a lawsuit 
$C: Lucky guy... Gets to cosplay at work every day
$C: PORN!
$C: Make money off of loss of Soul to Disney. .  And #MADE
$C: Nope they'll just cast someone with more jawline and cheekbone
$C: That or Disney sends him an S&D for using their characters likeness with our licencing it.
$C: [Pretty sure this guy would have the role locked down](https://i.redd.it/jwj76lcrp8w01.jpg)
$C: Instructions unclear, became Vladimir Putin
$C: I would buy one of these https://www.amazon.co.uk/Disney-Ratatouille-Jumbo-Remy-Plush/dp/B001RYO84M and stick to my shoulder. and would be Disney most memorable icon 
$C: Literally word for word what I was about to say. 
$C: Dude people are stealing your comment on Instagram and using it as their caption 
$C: I already told my friends about the upcoming movie!
$C: Op is a fucking liar. It's an old pic and it's not him
$C: Is it because he looks like the guy from Ratatouille? 
$C: You look like the guy from ratatouille !! Lol 
$C: How dare you cook in my kitchen!
$C: You're fired! F-I-R-E-D! Fired!
$C: Appetite is coming, and he's going to have a big ego! I mean ego!
$C: The GARbage boy?
$C: You are fired. F I R E D. Fired!!!
$C: I heard there was a deleted scene where it goes over that guys backstory. In the deleted scene he started off idealistic but got more and more cynical because of the chef industry.
$C: "Why do they call it Ratatouille? Ratatouille doesnt sound delicious. It sounds like rat and patootie.. RAT PATOOTIE!"
$C: GAHBAGE BOI
$C: His full name is actually alfredo linguine.
$C: You would be an idiot of ELEPHANTINE proportions, and you Linguini, are nooo idiot! :)
$C: F-I-R-E-D! FIRED!!
$C: I was going to suggest a rat stuffed animal.
$C: Seriously, this may be the best way for OP to head off those Ratatouille comments because the patrons then know that OP is very well aware that he looks like the guy.  Instead of them making a comment, most will simply chuckle to indicate that they understand OP's joke reference and be on their way.
$C: Then add a battery powered light to the inside to give the shadow. Lots of examples if you [google it](https://goo.gl/images/3SpRgs) 
$C: The health inspector would like a word.
$C: add an led light
$C: This is the only answer really.  When its that striking, youve just got to own it or it gets awkward.  Get a black outline of a rat embroidered onto the pocket of your coat or something. 
$C: Yeah! Own it!
$C: Put in a battery operated light taped inside and have it illuminate the inside of the hat to show the silhouette of the rat
$C: Agreed! OP will probably need a light source inside the hat to make it visible, but absolutely he needs to do this and post another pic. 
$C: Yes.  Embrace!  You can even go to ComicCons like this and be very popular.
$C: Don't they change hats every day?
$C: Fucking please do that and post it again. Maybe even do a little speaker
$C: And put a lit candle in the hat so it flickers and appears lifelike.
$C: Why use a fake one, when you can use a real one?
$C: And a light to backlight it
$C: I was just gunna say "He looks like that cartoon chef being controlled by a rat." When I read the title and laughed a loud!
$C: If you can't fight it then embrace it
$C: DO IT, OP!!!
$C: came here to say the same. imagine the their reaction when they make that comment and u lift your hat up to show them a cute stuffed rat. The mix of surprise and childlike wonder would be priceless.
$C: [here you go](https://imgur.com/ywmYFeq)
$C: Someone gild this xD

Seriously that's all he needs for his halloween costume 
$C: https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/?st=JIVU8AB8&sh=e4776a8d
$C: Yeah, own that shit, son!
$C: Oh god that‚Äôs the best idea since pulling out of Vietnam. 
$C: ooooooooÔºÅ
$C: Then when people mention it act like you've never seen the film
$C: Honestly just put a friggin rat cage on your head and hope one rat can find a way to control you by yanking you hair
$C: Yes!  Please do this, OP!

And maybe also make some ratatouille.
$C: Jokes aside, this is actually a good idea. If you do something to show that you know you look like him, less people will say it to you.
$C: Why isn‚Äôt the top comment ‚Äúyou look like the guy from ...‚Äù
$C: [All it takes is a little ingenuity.](https://www.foodbeast.com/news/ratatouille-chefs-hat/) 
$C: Yes I believe the expression is: work it

When something is unavoidable, your best course of action is to roll with it. It may not be to your liking but you will get a lot more mileage out of cracking jokes on yourself then trying to stop people from doing
$C:  How do we know he doesn't already have a rat under that hat... he certainly looks like he does... 
$C: This is assuming that there isn‚Äôt already a rat up there, under the hat. 
$C: I think [it'll look great](https://imgur.com/a/wVFKL87)
$C: OP please deliver
$C: Oh this is nice.

And get some kind of led light you can turn on to softly illuminate it.
$C: Then post a picture on reddit 
$C:  and wear a yellow led in the hat all night
$C: Or a rat shaped hair clip.
$C: r/wowthanksimcured
$C: Why should he change!? He was around first! Ratatouille is the one who should change!
$C: God damnit. I commented this as I was looking through and checking to make sure that no one else had yet.

Anyway this is basic math OP. You have 3 options, haircut, fat, or swole, your move.
$C: Can you be anymore helpful
$C: Have you tried... *Not* being a mutant?
$C: Yeah seriously a haircut would do a lot towards improving his appearance 
$C: Just don‚Äôt be yourself.
$C: No joke OP, do this.
$C: He should definitely do it before Disney sees this and sues him for looking too much like their IP.
$C: You can also get a little rat to help you out! 
$C: Yeah. Doesn't hurt one bit to apply. Think whether you actually want to go there later on.
$C: DO IT OP!!!
$C: Yes, they have a restaurant from Ratatouille I think!
$C: This is actually a great idea.
$C: OP where are you? You seeing this? 
$C: Do it my wife played jasmine at Disney land for a year right after high school she loved it. 
$C: He has to be goofy and awkward to maintain character though. The Micheal Cera collected works should be a good primer. 
$C: There‚Äôs a French restaurant in Epcot where they come around the tables with a remote control Remy. That would be perfect!
$C: That's a brilliant idea.
$C: Disney should send him a offer when they see this. 
$C: But he is more interested in cooking good food, and so is his rat.
$C: Just picture it OP, You playing Linguini as the Chef of the Crystal Palace in Magic Kingdom.
$C: He has to apply at Disneyland Paris since they have Ratatouille themed restaurant
$C: OP we will pool money to relocate you to Orlando so that you can pursue this. Let‚Äôs get a GoFundMe started.
$C: Op this is actually a good idea
$C: Disney is probably more likely to sue this guy for infringing on their copyrights.
$C: You will probably earn more and also have a great time while working. DO IT NOW OP, DELIVAR
$C: That's... Actually a really good fucking idea 
$C: Yup he needs to do this..
$C: Holy shit, great idea. OP, you should totally do this.
$C: Disney pays slave labor wages with no benefits.
$C: I hear they pay well /sarcasm
$C: Closest Disney Land is Paris, which is 600 km...
$C: Probably have to beat 1000 other lookalikes for the job. Better live thinking you are unique.
$C: Then he'd have live in Florida
$C: Disneyworld is opening a Ratatouille ride in a few years 
$C: legit, I'll be rooting for you no matter what the implications ahead.

$C: Tbh come to LA we're watching Ratatouille this Sunday with Socal Redditors : http://meetu.ps/e/Ftc7Y/hsdq8/a


$C: No custome needed. Someone is going to be terminated soon.
$C: Apply to Disney World since it's better. Then I can see you! 
$C: Then, after a few years. Cosplay as Fry.
$C: !remindme 7 days
$C: I'll test that too later.. Will keep you updated

Edit: update here https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/8tzsyf/i_work_in_a_kitchen_you_have_no_idea_how_many/e1bidry?context=3
$C: Showed just the photo to my hubby. He said, ‚ÄúYeah, I saw.‚Äù

Life is less thrilling when you‚Äôre both on here. 
$C: I showed it to my wife without the text and she said ‚ÄúPercy Weasley joined the KKK?‚Äù


And she has seen Ratatouille. 
$C: can confirm it [works!](https://imgur.com/gallery/sTRjB3r)
$C: I did the same thing, showed the picture to my wife and my twin 3 year olds, they all said ratatouille.
$C: I showed the picture to my wife and she didn't say anything. She's never seen Ratatouille. 
$C: Showed it to my husband and he said the same thing. 
$C: I placed the same picture in front of a mouse's hole and then I heard them something... "ratatouille."
$C: I posted it in our family group chat and my daughter said "Why do you have that photo of someone I went to school with?"

Turns out she wasn't joking and she actually went to school with this kid. The internet is weird.
$C: Showed it to my brother and he asked "is that the guy from ratatouille?"
$C: Just tried it myself - same exact response!
$C: Yeah I didn‚Äôt even have to read the caption to know 
$C: My sister did the same.
$C: Same with my daughter.
$C: I showed it to my parents and my dad said, ‚Äúthe Ku Klux Klan!‚Äù So...YMMV. 
$C: That's how I communicate to most people honestly.
$C: My kids too
$C: can confirm, girlfriend thinks he's the guy from ratatouille 
$C: This movie has been on repeat for our toddler for the last few weeks. Definitely trying this with my husband when he gets home.
$C: My girlfriend said "please tell me theres a mouse under that hat"
$C: Yup, it does work!
$C: Tried this too. She just kept saying "you're too far, I can't see." Then I got closer and she said the same thing.
$C: My husband said Percy Weasley. -10 points to Gryffindor. 
$C: Can confirm! Sent the picture to a friend without saying anything about it, and got [this as her reply! ](https://imgur.com/a/yXwZSHW)  lol. 

$C: Decided to do the same thing - wife just looked at the photo, smiled, and said ratatouille. 
$C: Haha same. Didn't need to say anything. She just said ratatouille. 
$C: I tried your same method on my boyfriend he looks at it for a second and then says "Am I suppose to know this person?" 
$C: I saw the picture before reading the post. I thought he was cosplaying Remy. 
$C: I showed my six year old and all he said was, "He has a rat on his head."
$C: Is your wife a toddler?
$C: https://imgur.com/a/EDaL9zp

My sister has similar thoughts.
$C: Showed this to my two kids...eyes widened and said 'ratatouille'.
$C: My girlfriend was not amused..
$C: Just did the exact same thing with my girlfriend, who said the same thing lol. She is a massive Disney fan though so maybe not so surprising
$C: I tested it also. My 8 yr old said "ratatouille".
$C: Just tried it with my GF, didn‚Äôt show the title and all she said was ‚Äúhe looks like the one from ratatouille‚Äù 
$C: I just tried this, me: "who does this guy look like?", wife: "the guy from ratatouille".

what a fun game, what else can we try?
$C: Just showed my girlfriend. She goes ‚Äúhahaha! Ratatouille!‚Äù

EDIT: whoever downvoted me is a bitch ass nigga
$C: This feature e wn works on mother's who are resting off a concussion
$C: Can confirm same test. Wife yelled Ratatouille!
$C: Got the same answer from my wife
$C: Just tried it. Wife, said, "ratatouille"
$C: I'll show your wife too. 
$C: Yep, just showed my girlfriend after I read your comment. Instant ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the ratatouille guy.‚Äù
$C: My four years old daughter screamed "Linguini!" right away! :)
$C: Works with toddlers, too.
$C: Same result from my husband.
$C: Lmfaoo 
$C: Sir, take off your hat off slowly and step away from the sauce pan...
$C: They should make a live action sequel with OP and call it Rata2ille
$C: 1. Put realistic looking "fake" rat under hat.
2. Remove hat from time to time to "wipe your brow."
3. Post reactions. 
$C: Someone really needs to put his image and the character image side by side. 
$C: ‚ÄúWhy would you name food after something sounds like rat pitooty?‚Äù
$C: Linguine! Whoever the tall, skinny guy in the kitchen is always gets that nickname. 
$C: That's how Charlie Chaplin once came in 2nd in a Charlie Chaplin look alike contest. 
$C: > You look more like the guy from ratatouille than the guy from ratatouille looks like the guy from ratatouille

This was a bit of a mind fuck. 
$C: Yo dawg I heard you like Ratatouille
$C: Hey, you look like the guy from Ratatouille.
$C: Yep... should get the part for the live action.
$C: More sage wisdom from mr. Dick Nipples. 
$C: Rat patooty
$C: When you look like someone more than he looks like himself...
$C: Yes. 
$C: Dude just needs to shave his head
$C: Seriously though omg!! Striking resemblance to a freaking animated character! 
$C: Classic u/dick-nipples
$C: Like how Ed Sheeran kinda looks like Ed Sheeran 
$C: What‚Äôs under that hat?
$C: No kidding. Get this guy a trip to Emeryville!

$C: You are everywhere wtf 
$C: should I get In-n-out or Chik-fil-a?
$C: Ratatouille 
$C: "Things that try to look like things often look more like things than things do. Its a well-known fact."
$C: Listen to Dick Nipples here!
$C: He's a dude, playing a dude, disguised as another dude. 
$C: Dick nipples i see you everywhere
$C: I agree fully with dick nipples.
$C: hey, you look like the guy from ratatouille
$C: Hey, you look like Barb from Stranger Things
$C: Except you look angry
$C: Came here for this.  Was not disappointed.
$C: hey, you look like the guy from ratatouille 
$C: /u/waterguy12 would love this

$C: hey, you look like the guy from ratatouille


$C: hey, you look like the guy from ratatouille
$C: Hey, you look like the guy from ratatouille.

$C: Came here to upvote this comment
$C: hey, you look like the guy from ratatouille
$C: Hey, you look like the guy from Ratatouille
$C: hey you, look like the, guy, from ratatouille
$C: He knows he is going for exactly that reference and yet he finds it annoying that people get to call him out... 
$C: Hey, you look like the guy from ratatouille
$C: Hey, you look like a ginger Michael Cera
$C: This was predictable, but I also thought about posting it as I clicked the thread 
$C: [removed]
$C: No I totally would be like "Yea they modeled that character after me."
$C: Or he could go around saying that the guy from Ratatouille looks like _him_
$C: And go after Disney for that royalty check!
$C: Yeah, at this point you kind of just have to steer into the skid. 
$C: Or OP can say the director/writer saw/met him one day, then made the Ratatouille character based on OP.
$C: Also, get yourself a girlfriend with a brunette bob and a saucy French attitude.
$C: [deleted]
$C: What arm thing homie?
$C: "He's taunting me with that rat, trying to make me think it's important! Oh, it's here, oh it's there... Is there a phantom rat? Am I going crazy?!?" 
$C: Suddenly pretend not to know what a potato is. 
$C: This isn't a pro tip at all. 
$C: Shittylifeprotip: get a brain injury and develop myoclonic epilepsy, and the random spastic motions will come naturally! 
$C: At first I read that as "tongue" and cringed.
$C: That‚Äôs a big ass rat
$C: Or he could buy a pet rat.
$C: that is rather disturbing
$C: ok, well, I guess he doesn't look EXACTLY like the guy from Ratatouille.
$C: Thanks, I hate it. 
$C: Heh I like all these edits I wonder what this one AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
$C: I upvoted this but I wish I could also give it a dislike. 
$C: How can I delete someone else's comment

$C: /u/Spez can you delete the above comment please thanks
$C: Thanks, I hate it.

But really this is great.
$C: Thank you for the nightmares that I will have tonight.
$C: Thanks for the nightmare. 
$C: Nailed it.
$C: Imagine a full length half animation half real life movie like this, terrifying.
$C: Why have you done this 
$C: Are you my mummy?
$C: And now it looks like someone has exposed Judge Doom....
$C: This makes me very uncomfortable
$C: So that's what an uncanny valley looks like
$C: Thanks for the nightmares.
$C: More like a live action Fry.
$C: That's the hardest I've laughed in a long time.  
$C: delete this fam

$C: Uhm you made it worse but in a good way though
$C: My man!
$C: Yeah, rub it in my never-been-guilded face how much gold you make.

$C: Time to quit your day job. I think you've found your true calling.
$C: He looks too much like a real chef, the smile is missing.
$C: This is what I've been looking for! Thank youuuu!
$C:  And where would you be from? My madam
$C: I second this guy
$C: He is quite cute

$C: Uncultured swines 
$C: OMG! You don't just *ask* to see under a man's toque!  
At least have him cook you dinner, first!
$C: That would be awesome and the kids would love it 
$C: That‚Äôs what led me here hahaha
$C: That was the üêÄ 
$C: You too?  I thought it was only me. 
$C: I appreciated this
$C: Love Whose Line. I was just thinking about him yesterday. 
$C: Which guy
$C: > Ryan Stiles

Aww Thank you :)
$C: The real voice is always in the comments.
$C: I think the first thousand people gave him the idea. 
$C: well fuck! now I wanna see that guy dressed as a cook...
$C: The more I scroll down the more comments I see saying this. I'm not really lol
$C: I chuckled
$C: Gain weight and get tattooed from head to toe!

$C: lol what?
$C: Don't tell ME what to do 
$C: To hide the rat
$C: Start up a political party, get supporters and win the general election, seize all power. 
$C: Do yourself a favour and watch it. In celebration of your cake day!
$C: stop
$C: Fills my heart my dear. Thank you
$C: I'll fuck your mother if you don't stop lying

$C: Holy shit haha
$C: id fuck it. 
$C: You look like the guy from ratatouille
$C: also you dont look to be a healthy weight
$C: Push it down a little lol
$C: I'm too scared to do that I'm afraid
$C: Or get a pet rat. They're very smart.
$C: It's fine. I'm a kp. gotta deal with abuse from chefs if they're nasty, but if you tell them to fuck off they leave you alone
$C: What's that lol
$C: üòÇoh God that's a terrific idea
$C: Calm down
$C: Hashtag

$C: This comment gets me paranoid. Please don't stab me
$C: How did he dislike it? In the picture, he just mentioned people say it to him a lot.
$C: Excuse ME? i'm a natural ginger :)
$C: This guy hasn't seen ratatouille
$C: Oof - save your burns for r/roastme friend, OP gets enough heat in the kitchen

E: but yeah don't wanna catch no ginger from my g bread, step up your hat game Linguini
$C: Your burns are kind of meh.
$C: I mean, what did you even hope to achieve here?
$C: The hat was too small and it ended up ripping... 
$C: ...Colette?
$C: I bet everyone loves talking to you.
$C: I bet you look like a fuckin' ogre
$C: He‚Äôs honestly a just normal looking guy. Why anyone would feel the need to post something as cruel, unnecessary (and untrue) as this just baffles me.

You‚Äôre an obvious troll, but maybe have a think about what life circumstances and choices have led up to you becoming such a pathetic, spiteful, hate spewing person. 


$C: You really can believe that, because you're aware that you are a massive piece of shit unlike most people.

Or maybe you are that thick.
$C: Finally someone who sees it to. God I had to vomit twice, because of this ratface
$C: I am the LEAST racist person, that YOU have ever met
$C: Is this bait.
$C: How would you know that he would never have sex just from his face? Maybe he already has.
$C: ["Not in the biz"](https://youtu.be/pZqJKvTFLdA)
$C: Be the chef who gets trotted out to meet the little kids

Get a cookspace visible from the dining area

Get trained by Disney choreographers on how to lead with his forehead and copy Linquini's jerky man-puppet cooking motions, inspecting ingredients at above-eye-level

The cute brunette chef gets in on the act, periodically coming over to berate/correct you

Actually hit it off IRL

Start seeing each other

The customers eat up the whole shtick like crazy

Ticket sales increase and the whole act ends up on YouTube

Catches the attention of a prominent food critic

He decides he's overdue for a "vacation"

Part 2 [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/8tzsyf/comment/e1c65ee)
$C: the french restaurant at epcot does a little bit for that movie actually, hed be a huge hit there. 
$C: And probably get paid an unlivable wage.
$C: Plus you might get an animatronic hat.
$C: > If he's experienced in the kitchen, and his attitude is friendly, I'm pretty sure he could at least get a job in one of their restaurants.

Step 1: Be Attractive

Step 2: Don't be a cartoon lookin' mother-trucker.... or is it the other way around....
$C: You must have not met many cooks, lmao.
$C: Finds out he has crippling fear of rodents....
$C: Make it happen, Reddit.
$C: He works in a kitchen. If he was good with people, he wouldn't work in a kitchen

Source: work in a kitchen
$C: Oh yeah. Especially the French Epcot part 
$C: They used to have an animatronic Remy on a restaurant cart
$C: Or Disney will send him a pet rat.
$C: I'm pretty sure Disney pays their employees really well too. I'd check it out! 
$C: Holy crap, this is a really cool idea.
$C: And he spells well
$C: a2a
$C: You might have just found this guy a dope job
$C: But then I would associate him with rats cooking food. Yikes.  
$C: Actually, if he was bad in the kitchen that might add to the role.
$C: A ‚Äúcease to exist‚Äù
$C: Cheese and desist sounds great
$C: I despise my chef's wage, but at least I've got this rat in a cage.
$C: Had to scroll way too much for this comment.
$C: Figures. :/
$C: Not true at all. I can confirm it IS me. pm me if you want
$C: Hiiiiiighly suspect!
$C: One can get too familiar with vegetables, you know!

# LAROUSSE! DRAW AND QUARTER THIS MAN, AFTER YOU PUT HIM IN THE DUCK PRESS TO SQUEEZE THE FAT OUT OF HIS HEAD!
$C: Haha is that from Ratatouille?
$C: Waiter:She would like to see the chef

Skinner:But he he.....ermkuv er
$C: Why is it so hard to talk to you!?
$C: Anton Ego is just another customer. LETS COOK!
$C: "Gusteau's corn puppies. They're like corn dogs, only smaller. Bite-size!"
$C: You know what this needs? Saffron!
$C: I can't cook, can I?
$C: That's correct, but that's the way the Head Chef yells at him.
$C: Nopppitty nope nope noperoo.
$C: I was going to suggest a live rat. 
$C: I know what you mean to say but it sounds like you're suggesting he use a teddy bear stuffed with rats
$C: The lil ones from IKEA 
$C: Ok, got it. Stuffed rat is now on the menu.
$C: Ikea makes a good sized one for kids that would work perfectly.
$C: What kind of animal would you stuff the rat into?
$C: So a cat who just ate?
$C: Stuffed rat=free money for this guy
$C: What animal would you stuff the rats into?
$C: An animal stuffed with rat? That‚Äôs pretty gory!
$C: Which would violate health regulations.
$C: [Live action Ratatouille](https://i.imgur.com/x6n9AbP.jpg)
$C: It shouldn't be much trouble for Disney to adapt the [banshee shoulder puppets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0-EsyVqJpM) they already use in Avatarland.
$C: And put a little light inside the hat, to cast a shadow.
$C: Also making the restaurant extremely popular very quickly.
$C: Own the narRATive!
$C: Weaponized Pixar references
$C: It‚Äôs also a great way to disguise the actual rat under the hat who directs all the cooking. 
$C: It can even be a fun game.  He can ask patrons to get the flashlight on their phone app and hold it up to his hat.  Children would love it!
$C: I love the idea! I can just imagine though, the sort of rule loving in-humorous person who says something like, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not funny to joke about rats in a restaurant, it‚Äôs a health hazard‚Äù or something like that.
$C: Heading the joke off at the pass. I like it!
$C: And then they all yell "ANYONE CAN COOK!" into the kitchen...
$C: Dude will seriously rack in tip money if he does this. 
$C: Chuckle, nod, tip your hat.  
$C: Seems a little much. I feel like it should be nice and subtle. Maybe a REALLY dim LED, with natural lighting helping out out sometimes.
$C: Link for blocked short links.

$C: its real life dude. you don't wanna look like you are trying too hard to look cool.
$C: I can't trust a chef who cooperates with rats. Sorry.
$C: Surely bits of paper isn't a violation? 
$C: Ok, but only 4 bytes.
$C: Just doodle a rat on the front. Embrace it.
$C: No
$C: omg another subreddit! thanks!
$C: as much as your comment made me laugh that sub is just depressing.
$C: They're all so whiny in the comments
$C: I mean, he could change his hair (dye and cut), grow a beard, get some piercings, etc. 
$C: Buncha whiners need to snap out of it.

$C: Best sub I've found this month.
$C: I‚Äôm so happy to know this is a subreddit.
$C: Welp, I'm going down the rabbit hole. Tell my family I loved them.
$C: Uh oh, sounds like someone's got a case of the Linguine's
$C: His name isn't Ratatouille, it's Ratatouille's monster ffs
$C: uh how about replacing that chef hat with any other variety of chef hat. There's like 10 different types.

source: professional cook 10 years
$C: I can basically guarantee he'll make more money as a disney attraction than a cook
$C: Yea! Dude, op do it. Go work for peanuts
$C: Or the porn version of the movie.
$C: I actually was almost barred from entering Disney land for wearing a green summer dress and having red hair. they said I was impersonating princess Merida. my sneakers got me in. 
$C: Good one XD Have a [Reddit Silver](http://f.thumbs.redditmedia.com/wPjOQrGRacUELOnM.png) :D
$C: I think the Remy animatronic display is at  the European Disney right now. He used to be at the French restaurant at Disneyworld and he was so freaking cute. He does little bows to diners. 
$C: They should beg him to do it 
$C: The application can just be this picture
$C: Well it doesnt hurt but it is a waste of time if he has no intention of moving.
$C: STEW IT
$C: There is a ride coming to Epcot in the French Pavilion. Not sure if they still do it, but Les Chefs de France had a "cheese cart" that would come around with Remy on it to guests as they waited for their meal.

$C: I'm walking home while reading this. Yeah I think it's a great idea lol
$C: Not anymore. 
$C: The Ratatatouille restaurant is at Disneyland Paris. 
$C: What's taking so long?
$C: I can confirm. She could not remember the title but could remember the name of the rat Remy and said it right away
$C: Stay away from his wife you scoundrel 
$C: Just did the same thing with my husband and he said "wow. Ratatouille"
$C: Message someone with it and just say "They're making a live action version". Post results.
$C: Worked on my mom
$C: What did kcwckf's wife say?
$C: With his wife? Pretty sure she would say the same thing.
$C: Me too. Brb... abject failure, and they‚Äôre all of bunch of movie buffs. ‚ÄúWho is that?, Who is that?‚Äù So disappointing. They were even talking about movies when I interrupted the conversation. 
$C: Fuck you! Update already!
$C: Literally same as his wife, "Ratatoullie!"
$C: I Will also test wife later when I see her.
$C: Story of my life. 
$C: So often my gf shows me something on Facebook and I just reply with "yeah I saw that on Reddit two days ago"
$C: Haha! My wife shows me stuff from DouYin, I show her stuff from reddit
$C: Same girl, same
$C: I get that all the time,  I'm pretty stoked if I show him something he's not seen yet
$C: When I first saw this post this morning I feared that mine already saw it too but texted anyway. He didn't, and texted back "Ratatouille?" and was plum pleased with himself when I told him what was going on. It never works out like that though so I wonder if he was just humoring me haha
$C: I mean, Percy Weasley worked for the Wizarding KKK for a while. Mostly against his will, but still...
$C: My mom's response without context. Just the picture.

 https://imgur.com/zvDPGj0
$C: /r/badfaketexts
$C: Wait was that really his name?
$C: I also showed the picture to your wife and she said, "Who the fuck are you, and how did you get in here?"
$C: Same. Son instantly smiled and sad "Ratatouille!"
$C: Plot hole: how can they be your twins if they're 3?
$C: I showed the picture to my dog.

My dog didn't say anything, because he died 3 years ago.  
$C: Holy shit who's that then?
$C: Haha, oh dear
$C: Noooo I haven't even seen the movie yet and I knew haha
$C: Complaining about downvotes?

That‚Äôs a downvote
$C: So weird when innocuous stuff like this gets downvoted
$C: He should put a false silhouette of a rat in his hat.
$C: Take off your sauce slowly and step away from the hat...
$C: GOT YOUR TOQUE!!1!
$C: Toque*
$C: >take off your hat off 
$C: --HE'S GOT A RAT!
$C: you my friend need a job in marketing. 
$C: Except this time the rats all have plague and we can make it a rated R revenge film after the closing of Gusteuaus 
$C: Rata deux ille? 
$C: 2Rata2touille
$C: The second sequel can be called Rat3touille, pronounced rat-trois-touille, where Remy shows Linguini how 3 rats make a tuile.
$C: Get this guy a Maserati and a Producer credit stat.
$C: Want a job?
$C: they travel to america and meet gordon ramsay.

$C: hey, you look like the guy from ratatouille 
$C: I came into the thread when there were about 500 comments. I was hoping they would all be this. Like that everyone is a bot askreddit. 
$C: hey, you look like the guy from ratatouille

$C: Well I just laughed so hard I shat out chocolate milk...
$C: You owe me a new keyboard and medium coffee from Caribou 
$C: **GONE**
$C: Haha yes
$C: I don't think it would be unreasonable to state your belief that OP looks like the guy from ratatouille at this juncture. Because he *does* look like the guy from ratatouille.
$C: Hey, you look like the guy from Ratatouille.
$C: "Yeah I had this one incident with a rat in a soup and they made a whole story out of it. Anyways, what will you be having tonight?"
$C: also move to France, this should make it easier.
$C: In fact, this is good advice in general. 
$C: She should be hot too. Don't forget the hot part.

$C: ask to the red guys
$C: Came for a side by side. 

Disappointed. 
$C: Yeah, what the heck... are we the only two people that didn't have the reference pic memorized? I had only vaguely even heard of the movie.
$C: I had no idea what the character looked like. I saw the movie once. 
$C: where's the side by side?
$C: Life is hard.
$C: So much better!

$C: Just wear a batch, that says: I know.
$C: Why are we photoshopping a rat into his picture? 

Haven't we just established that everyone agrees he looks like that ratatouille guy? You think you get a better picture done than Disney?

You should obviously use a PR picture of ratatouille as your profile pic and then, when someone questions that fire back with this picture.
$C: Cool bro!! ME TOO!
$C: Don't use that version. It's crap. Use the ones below.
$C: Did this on my phone in about 1 minute.... Best I can do haha
$C: Well ok, I think between my accounts it‚Äôs around 30 times....
$C: *tips chef's hat*
$C: He is a sharp-looking guy from Minnesota, going by the post history. My dude. 
$C: I‚Äôm from Minnesota. And I‚Äôm a guy (sorry).
$C: He's in your basement...
$C: You should have checked profile first... Its a guy! 
$C: ASL?
$C: My sir *
$C: He's married, I'm afraid. But fairly handsome, according to his profile picture.
$C: It's a dude
$C: Uh... not even madam-adjacent.
$C: Bamboozled
$C: u/9bloomia is a dude 
$C: If you check out the post history, you'll see some gonemild pics. The pics aren't bad tbh.
$C: Ughhhh... He's a guy. 

So, do you mean "My Sir"? 
$C: *m'toque blanche*
$C: Pretty sure that‚Äôs just your mom.
$C: [Ooh La La!](https://assets-auto.rbl.ms/13273cc2f3968434cec2e5a95ff8e334d7d2d83e342f1a7bce298921eda06399)
$C: Oh god 
$C: Could be a guy
$C: Did you just assume my gender?!

That's something the guy from ratatouille would do.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Right when he's first introduced to Chef Skinner - one of the cooks says "Look who is here!  Alfredo Linguini, Renata's little boy." 
$C: But it's also a dish name
$C: I love you guys
$C: I don't get it
$C: the guy from ratatouille
$C: These two should have a face off.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I mean, if you see it a lot, it means it‚Äôs true. So just take it in. ;)
$C: We need photo evidence to judge that for ourselves. Please!
$C: Damn this hit the front of r/all and my comment has only two points on it right now. I'm honored that you would reply to it and wish I had bothered to say something more helpful or at least more clever. If you want ideas on how to get it to stop I'd suggest growing a beard or changing your hairstyle to something that looks less like exactly what Linguinis hair looked like in the movie. If you have any use for glasses that might also help you look different. Face tattoos would probably make it stop but may be too drastic.

$C: üòä

$C: Also cause of the rat
$C: That guy isn‚Äôt a chef from a famous Pixar movie. 
$C: turn that frown upside down...
$C: Very reassuring, thank you
$C: Korleis er v√¶ret der nede? Er det lavtrykk :P
$C: In the movie noone knew he was the chefs son. And if they keep calling him guy from ratatouille instead of linguini they don't know his name. I guess I tried too hard.
$C: You've got at least one follower.
$C: Awwwwww ur welcome üòÄ
$C: I was referencing the movie. The main character is a garbage boy at first and the head chef despises him. Have you seen the movie? It‚Äôs really good. One of my Pixar favorites 
$C: Im also a ginger, just trying to have fun between red head bros.
$C: Sometime you gotta go back a month later and say "damn....you right." 
$C: Interesting, I'm kinda surprised but that's good to know chefs take a good "fuck off and let me do my job" well enough. 
$C: That movie was inspired by my story. And show them the mouse in your hat
$C: Wrong
$C: Burns? I'm telling the truth.

That should not be allowed in a kitchen. 
$C: I‚Äôll be his Colette... lmao
Edit: and he will be my linguini.. together we could make several little food babies 
$C: Ask em
$C: Yes.  Chefs are comparable to vacuous wannabe filmmakers.  Absolutely.  If its habitual drug an alcohol use you want.  The difference is one of us fucking delivers.

$C: This is so wholesome
$C: r/greentext
$C: Get a rat in your hat!
$C: Where is the profit? That's supposed to be Step 3. This is too long. :P
$C: I remember reading that Disney hate it when their staff go out with each other and there are always co-workers ready to start drama over it. 


$C: green text man saves the day
$C: You are kind of romantic in a bizarre way. It‚Äôs nice to see. Not being a creeper I just overdosed on Jane Austen and Emily Bront√´ growing up and I thought I was a dying breed.

$C: Off to Disney World he goes. 
$C: You forgot the greentext
$C: But how does it end? You can't leave this hanging.
$C: Sounds beautiful. Someone should make a movie out of this.
$C: ‚ÄùRatatuille looks tired‚Äù
$C: This is 100% an Andy Dwyer plan.
$C: Don't say "trotted out" like it's ok to use a horse or similar animal for showing off. They're not toys for your entertainment.

Humans are animals, and no more special than any other creature.
$C: I've eaten at that restaurant.  It's GOOOOD French cuisine.  Normally, you need to reserve days in advance, but I had a French speaker in my party which went over well with the Parisian hostess.
$C: Plus a live-action Colette would probably be attractive. So bonus.
$C: [deleted]
$C: The American dream
$C: I mean, it's not like the restaurant industry in general is known for their stellar wages. Doubtful he'd be taking a pay-cut, unless maybe he works in Manhattan or San Fran or some other place with really high cost of living, since Orlando would be a lot cheaper to live in, I would think. May actually get some sort of benefits too if he's working full time at Disney.
$C: He said ‚Äúif‚Äù

$C: "Cheap sausages dipped in batter and deep fried. You know...'American'."
$C: Full commitment
$C: I was going to suggest a rat that can cook.
$C: Live rat that knows how to cook*
$C: I was going to suggest a health inspector
$C: I was going to suggest Patton Oswald
$C: A dead rat could work as well. 
$C: Tiny kitten wearing rat onesie. 
$C: ‚ÄúBasil‚Äù
$C: Snatch one out the gutter. No pet store wannabes. (A gutter near a hospital might be best.)
$C: I was going to suggest an animated rat emitted from a future hologram machine
$C: LINGUUUUUUUUINE 
$C: I think a dead rat makes way more sense.
$C: Never go full retard. 
$C: Can we dye the rat's fur? Or put a contacts on its eyes? Maybe we can also train it to hold his hair
$C: Teach it to pull your hair
$C: You can call it (pet rat) an emotional support companion so you can bring it to work with no worries. 
$C: Chuck E. CHEESE rat?
$C: To make it better, teach it to cook.
$C: Can it have Patton Oswalt's voice?
$C: I was going to say a cat but yours is 10/10
$C: Make sure it can cook and communicate with the chef
$C: I've seen 2Fast 2Furious. I do not recommend that.
$C: I was going to suggest suggestive gestures 
$C: I was going to suggest a mafia informer.
$C: And a new job
$C: I was just going.
$C: Step 1: Get pet rat

Step 2: Bathe and clean pet rat extensively

Step 3: Train pet rat to sit still in hair, and eat food given

Step 4: ?

Step 5: Pixar movie!
$C: Best comment
$C: Hat catches on fire, rat burrows to safety. 
$C: I was gonna suggest Don Jr as a slave, but that works too
$C: A live CHEF rat
$C: I was going to suggest a talking rat with culinary knowledge.

$C: HE obviously keeps that in his pants.
$C: That escalated quickly
$C: That'd cost too much money. Here's a dead rat instead.
$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cEBYNkGmvI (french)
$C: Aren't all Teddy bears stuffed with rats?
$C: It's true, everyone would be amused by the idea and it's one way to stand out as a chef and get your name out there, as strange as it is =P gotta take advantage of every chance you get =)
$C: If OP plays his cards right he could be Internet famous for this too
$C: Yes!  This could very well turn into free advertising for the restaurant.  I ended up with an unusual job title at work and it's actually brought customers in.  It started as a joke and eventually became official, I have it on my business cards.  I have had many customers call or walk in and ask for me by using my title.
$C: The majority of people aren‚Äôt going to understand why it looks like he has a rat in his hat. 
$C: > restarount wxtremely
$C: I don‚Äôt understand why nobody is congRATtulating you for this pun.
$C: So that's our solution, Reddit? To ask a chef to do paper crafty stuff to his chef's hat?
$C: Well you want it to be a bit obvious so people aren‚Äôt asking *what are you supposed to be* every five minutes.
$C: Depends on the lighting.  If it's a dark room. Yes.  Fully lit which most kitchens typically are. Then you need something bright.
$C: It would make me smile, plus, who cares?
$C: That sounds like a bribe to me, you wouldn't bribe the health inspector, would you?
$C: A violation of the lack of humor that all inspectors of all sorts seem to have.
$C: I am actually not sure about that. If they are loose, they risk falling into the food. 
$C: There are so many of them!
$C: [deleted]
$C: Boy have I got good news dor you. There's a random subreddit button.
$C: Exactly my thought. It was entertaining for like, two seconds then I realized it was just a bunch of depressed people.
$C: That's just a derivative of haircut.
$C: Yeah thats the Point :D
$C: Epcot has a restaurant in France and they have a cart with a puppet Remy that they wheel out for the kids. Could you imagine how many shits would be flipped if fucking Linguine shows up? They'll have to shut the restaurant down. 
$C: They dont pay people for shit. He's better off not honestly.
$C: Por que no los dos?
$C: Well really he should be a roller-skating waiter, so he can double up as both an attraction and make tips.
$C: And work less.
$C: Not necessarily. Totally depends on a lot of factors. I'm making pretty good money for 21 years old and doing something I love. I work with cooks that have been at one restaurant for 6 years and are making 22-24 bucks an hour and they're not even Sous. Fine dining is where it's at. There's so much meticulous bullshit you have to put up with, most well established high end places have to pay their cooks pretty good. It's the only way to get them to stay.
$C: And they apparently do nothing but have sex with other cast members. Dream job
$C: So you have tasted his food?
$C: Depends on where you are and the moves you bring to the table ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
$C: Depends on the type of cook. 
$C: Life isn't all about money. 
$C: Only until he hits puberty
$C: And hed make more money in a regular restaurant than a Disney restaurant
$C: Why not BOTH!?
$C: DISNEY would make more money than he would make as a cook.  

$C: Rat-a-DO-ME
$C: That‚Äôs fucking disgusting they train a mouse and just let him roam around a restaurant just because it‚Äôs based on a movie they made? Fuckers should be shut down 
$C: There's a Ratatouille in Anaheim Disneyland, too.
$C: Even better! 
$C: He has to marry someone first
$C: She's watching football and I have an online race to start in a few minutes ;)
$C: He didn't know where /u/kcwckf lives. He's gotta find that before he can ask his wife.
$C: he's driving over to kcwckf's house to ask his wife. It's all the way on the other side of the country.
$C: He's trying to track down the guy's wife still.
$C: How is this picture so huge on Reddit. I love reddit 
$C: Ouch. OP looks like Remy confirmed?
$C: Just got home and showed my wife. She asked if his name is linguine, the dude's name in the movie.
$C: I choose this guy's wife as well
$C: Very consistent wife!
$C: "Can you take out the garbage" maybe? Not sure really.. but my guess is she could have said a whole lot of things since his post
$C: Look closer!
$C: Amazing. Let me try.

Edit: She took it as some kind of Rorschach test, I don't know. I got a dud guys. https://imgur.com/8OluBTG

$C: Fuck you, ugly irrelevant bitch !!!!!!
$C: Probably jealous that I have an epic girlfriend and  they‚Äôre virgin losers!!‚Äô1
$C: Exactly, might as well lean into it.
$C: I see a little silhouetto of a rat 
$C: Oh man i love this idea, cute and clever! üçùüêÄ
$C: sure i saw someone do that already, they cut our their rat shape and stuck like an led headlamp in their hat, worked well recommend this guy doing it
$C: With a little led tea light.
$C: I will design, build and provide an LED back-lit rat hat-insert free of charge if OP agrees to do it.
$C: Yes!
$C: Oh man OP please deliver on this one!
$C: But can he do the fandango?
$C: Taking the top comment and making it your own.  Bold strategy.
$C: Or.... a real silhouette of a rat...
$C: Why stop there? Put a real rat in there and let him cook.
$C: I see a false silhouette-o of a rat 
$C: He needs one of those $1 stuffed rats from Ikea. 
$C: Almost didn‚Äôt recognize you without my sauce on your face
$C: Actually, I smelled the sauce. Put the sauce back on slowly, and...just keep cooking.
$C: Take off your pan...
$C: Slowly take off your pan and sauce the hat away from sir.
$C: and OP, my friend, needs a job in acting.
$C: This is my moment
$C: [deleted]
$C: You mean a job in reposting.
$C: And with a rat sex scene.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I would pay to watch this movie hundreds of times if it gets made. 
$C: Isn't that just Willard but in a restaurant
$C: I like the cut of your jib!
$C: 2Rata2Furious
$C: Gusteau‚Äôs was closed after Egos visit since they had to free the health inspecter. Do you even Pixar, bro??
$C: Tell the truth. You borked out at spelling the name, no?
$C: You probably pronounced "deux" wrong and now 4 out of 5 french people hate you.
$C: Now it sounds like French for "rata-mourning". Who dies?
$C: 5now Dog5
$C: That‚Äôs actually pretty genius
$C: Uhh yeah?
$C: Followed to Ratatouille: Tokyo Drift
$C: God damn it 
$C: Whoa. The resemblance is uncanny! Thanks!
$C: Thank you! He really does look like Linguini 
$C: I think you forgot to add OP.  I only see the guy from ratatouille 
$C: This is way too low.  I've never seen the film so I have no idea who this is.
$C: Came here looking for exactly this.
$C: Holy shit

$C: Please watch it. It is probably in the top 200 or so films of all time.
$C: Atouille look from you guy the rat
$C: Why u no put link??
$C: You mean the üôÄa2e
$C: Much better 
$C: It looks better but why would Remy need a spoon in the hat?
$C: Yes!!!
$C: Thank you, that photoshop was killing me. 
$C: Shouldn't he be pulling his hair instead of holding a spoon?
$C: That‚Äôs what I was wishing I could create haha 
$C: Why is the spoon in the hat? Seems unsanitary 
$C: Revision 2 is definitely the best improvement
$C: You deserve the gold, sir. Have this upvote instead as it's all I can afford.

$C: Oh. Guess I'm a filthy casual.
$C: Wasn‚Äôt this kids idea though wasn‚Äôt it remys?
$C: A play off of people calling it Frankenstein vs. Frankenstein‚Äôs monster.. insinuating that Ratatouille is this guy‚Äôs name when in reality it‚Äôs the rat controlling him. Even though no character in the movie is actually named Ratatouille, which makes it funnier.
$C: What's ratatouille
$C: Nah, this OP wins. His red hair is on point.

$C: Most cooks I know, as well as myself, are some pretty foul mouth folks. Also, drug problems are a stereotype. Don't get me wrong, they're typically genuine, honest people. I've made lots of good friends in kitchens.

A closed door kitchen is probably the most chaotic worm environment I've experienced. Being a cook is sort of like being a pirate, but you usually don't get the booty.

$C: If you come on down to Custom Rat Barn, we'll whip you up a rat that can whip you up anything! So come on down, the prices are low, the service is friendly, and the rats are never GMO-free! We'll even throw in a rat with type 2 diabetes, absolutely free!

$C: Yeah. What did you expect? 
$C: Only if Gordan Ramsay comes in and says, "Holy shit! Is that your idea of a rat sillhouette? Come on you soulless ginger, that looks like a fucking copybara, or possibly an overweight squirrel. Did you pay any attention to your fucking twat of an art teacher!?! The pork chops that I just stuffed and braised could do better, and they have been dead two weeks!

$C: I think /u/stupidrobots meant he'd make more money walking the park in costume than he would working in a restaurant at the park.
$C: Yeah.... People telling him to work for Disney. He'd be much better off as a cook, and even then it'd probably be a downgrade from his current job. 
$C: Yeah it was shit
$C: This is something poor people say
$C: It's a robot

$C: Not only is it disgusting to have your wild hair exposed inside a kitchen, it's also against the hygeine standards of most countries.

You think chefs give a crap if you think they're mean? We protect the food, the customers and our reputations. Period. If that means pointing out an ugly, unhygenic and unprofessional uniform then so be it.

I think it's mean to ignore decades of professionalism and have someone's gross ginger hair hovering over people's food because they can't be bothered wearing a proper hat and think they're funny for looking like a character from a children's movie. This isn't a game, food goes inside people's bodies. 

Your cliche attempt at some putdowns was pathetic and they took you hours to write. All you have to show after that are some canned insults. 

Perhaps for your next try, you could load up the Shakespeare Insult Generator and impress your Dorito eating, 18 year old internet cheerleaders with some random words you don't understand. 

If someone wants to play cute at "working in a kitchen" they should at least project some concern for food safety. Otherwise take that fake uniform off or don't post it online.

$C: Nah, not enough downvotes for an EA comment

$C: Instructions were unclear and now my ass is full of things
$C: There's no such thing as halfway cooks
$C: Don‚Äôt knock a good half assed job now.I got to where I am today by slapping food onto something that wasn‚Äôt intended to be used as a plate, randomly drizzling  sauce in ‚Äúelaborate patterns‚Äù, and topping mediocre food with fresh micro greens to gobs and gobs of unnecessary praise.

I took it at first to mean you were making a cheeky joke about the actual character traits about Gaston, and then I thought "Wait, I don't remember Gaston's good financial sense ever having been brought up in Beauty and the Beast...." Then I realized that I'm dumb...

$C: The monster that everyone calls Frankenstein was created by Dr. Frankenstein in the story. It was never actually given a name, so it‚Äôs a pretty common misconception for people to refer to it as ‚ÄúFrankenstein,‚Äù and in recent years people have been quick to point that out to people. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not Frankenstein, it‚Äôs Frankenstein‚Äôs *monster*.‚Äù

The parallel being made here is that in Ratatouille the rat is ‚Äúcontrolling‚Äù the chef - so in a sense it‚Äôs like he *created* him and made him into the chef he is. The person who made this original comment was trolling the OP, pretending like he was referring to the character‚Äôs name *as* Ratatouille (which he obviously didn‚Äôt). So in essence, the commenter was trying to convince us that he was stupid and thought the rat‚Äôs name was Ratatouille while also saying ‚ÄúHey! That‚Äôs not Ratatouille, that‚Äôs the guy that Ratatouille was controlling.‚Äù Hence the Frankenstein relationship.

A) you're legitimately concerned over the subject and lashing out at me inappropriately over an innocent word choice, or

B) You're a low-effort troll trying to provoke me with a false display of activism.

Either way it goes, I'm done interacting with you. Go ahead and take the last word, I bid you good day.
$C: I find it really sad that you're spending time doing this pointless trolling. Go outside, get some fresh air buddy.

$C: half ass means poorly done with potentially poor outcome. think about  what would happen if you only had half an ass.
$C: You're supposed to double-half-ass one thing, so it's really just full-assing.
$C: It‚Äôs a speed crack. It helps reduce surface area and let your ass be used like ice skates.

Think about why it‚Äôs vertical instead of horizontal, same reason.

$C: A lot of criminals have better morals than the cops. The law says to just dump the unused rats in the garbage despite them usually already being customized to have the chill behaviors needed in a pet rat, so sometimes the staff are cool enough to break bad and try to find homes for them. This is why our country will be ok

$C: Not much actually. Face actors like the Disney princesses get paid around 13.50 starting. Pay caps out at only 16. 

It seems like an entertaining job but those wages are pretty miserable given the level of talent and patience you'd need for a job like that.

$C: Nah its because people want to work there so badly that they are willing to accept lower wages. Also actors don't get paid well to begin with. 
Stealth Edit: That doesn't mean they aren't evil though.

$C: But their upper management deserves the 150k plus bonuses. /S
$C: Who would have thought that one of the most evil corporations in the world wouldn't pay their employees properly... 
$C: That sounds like them there trickle down economics grandpa keeps tellin me about
$C: They also have an army of people that work there.  Ride attendants, parade performers, stage performers, costumed staff, handlers, janitors, general staff, etc etc...
$C: no u
$C: Can‚Äôt stand the heat, get out of the faux kitchen
$C: I couldn't find anything on that but I've seen a starting wage of 8.50 for characters so I'm assuming that's for costumed actors. 

The face actors have to have a very specific appearance and a huge personality tied to actual acting skills. Princesses do quite a lot of talking and acting whereas the costumed actors aren't even allowed to speak. 

All around the wages for Disney park employees seem to be an absolute joke. Disney princess jobs are very high in demand, competitive, and require skill. In the meantime you can bag groceries at a Whole Foods for the same wages? Pathetic.

$C: M
$C: OMG YOU HAVE NO IDEA
$C: Haha, now *that's* funny.
$C: It's not snobbery it's standards. 

He said, **"I work in a kitchen"**. That *was* the context. 

You're attempting to defend a karma whore who you claim lied about working in a kitchen. That just makes this all even more pathetic.

And chefs don't "dress up" to "impress", there are practical reasons for a uniform such as *not leaving ginger head pubes in people's food*. 

Seriously, stick to your McDonalds.

Oh and something something, "my uniform is not your karma magnet".

Edit: You added more ignorant nonsense to your post. Even if someone doesn't make the food if they are IN the kitchen their hair is a potential contaminent. Glad I will never have to eat anything you 'cook'.

All could just be avoided if people weren't fakes on Reddit being defended by other fakes.

I have a right to point out how condescending it is to dress up as a chef and have your hair falling all over the place if you claim to work in a kitchen. It's not funny. 
$C: Yeah they change colors so use that.  
$C: Yes it‚Äôs a bananosecond

Fruit flies like a banana.

$C: Yes, very carefully 
$C: I work until banana PM today, I'll let you know when I'm off
$C: Depends on where you are putting the banana.
$C: Maybe like how long it takes you to say banana?
$C: From fresh to spoiled...
$C: The time it takes to consume a banana could be used as the base in a new time metric.
$C: You can set one up like a sundial, so technically, yes. 
$C: If it takes someone 5 minutes to eat a banana 1 hour = 30 bananas so, assuming one work day is 8 hours, you're work day = 240 bananas
$C: If it's below 6 there's a 50% chance yes
$C: Woke n boke

$C: 150k plus bonus for the upper management of Disneyland? I feel like that's a gross underestimation. 
$C: Hehe thx bby
$C: With the amount of money they charge for everything you‚Äôd think they could pay people a little better. 
$C: >Disney princess jobs are very high in demand, competitive, and require skill.

The two former outweigh the latter in determining the pay.
$C: > In the meantime you can bag groceries at a Whole Foods for the same wages? Pathetic.

Sure sure, but what are the fringe benefits?  Do the character actors get tips from people or anything?  Do they get free entrance into the parks at Disney World (for example) for friends and family?  Free food?  How many hours do they work?  Maybe they can combine it with a job at an on-park resort?  Possibly results in free living arrangements?

I mean...I guess I wouldn't be surprised if there were no benefits, but there has to be a reason that those positions are in such high demand. 
$C: Damn, that's terrible. Minimum wage here in Oregon is $11.25, and it's going up in July I think. Plus, our servers get paid the full minimum wage every hour, and they get to keep all their tips. I love Oregon.

$C: Bananaspace-time
$C: Um ....

So assuming an hour is sixty minutes in banana math.

60/5 = 12

1 hour = 12 bananas

12 * 8 hour = 96

96 bananas per day 









$C: You know that 60 minutes (an hour) devided by 5 minutes ( 1 banana) is 12 right?...

$C: Do you have a source that the actors working at Disney parks only work there because they want to play princess? Sounds pretty dismissive to say it like that.
$C: Gotta make fire first.
$C: Currently, you have no way of knowing if you‚Äôre correct or not.  All you can do is keep acting like the bitter cunt that you are, because nobody cares what you think or do.  Your opinion is unwarranted and unwanted, and your motivations are both unknowable and asinine.  But if it helps you get through the day without jumping off a building, sure, you can be ‚Äúnot wrong‚Äù.  This is fun.  I look forward to more of this.

$C: omg another subreddit! thanks!


$C: I think it'd be nice to see a source too but I don't think it's dismissive.  Even without mentioning it in my post, I did feel like that was a plausible reason.  I don't even think that'd be a bad reason to take such a job.  I mean, if it's what you want to do and you feel the fulfillment is worth more than the pay.  "Find a job you love, and you'll never work a day in your life," kind of thing.

A different example that illustrates where I'm going with this.  I planned for 3 years to start my own business, and was perfectly ready to cut my salary by 75% to make it happen.  Granted, the thought process there was that the business would grow and make profits that I could then reap.  I imagine that a Disney Princess' future value worth reaping is about on par with a .COM business that sells parkas exclusively to residents of Death Valley. 

Jesus Christ, what did I just write?
$C: Gotta smoke em first
$C: You mean Russell?
$C: Can you just please explain to me why you think regurgitating overused comments is creative?

People like you are the reason comment chains in every thread say the same thing, surely you must realize that.

Maybe its because it "stops you from jumping off a cliff" or whatever, not really sure how we got to that point.

$C: Lol.

It might just be because I know a couple people who were princes/princesses. Some may have liked Disney before, but they‚Äôre all really serious about their job and are often actors (or trying to be), especially out in California. The princesses in particular have it rough, one of the reasons being what you said in your nice analogy.

I think there are very few people who have Ben brainwashed by Disney in the childhoods so thoroughly that they‚Äôre willing to take on a grueling job just to do what a lot of outsiders consider paid dress-up.
