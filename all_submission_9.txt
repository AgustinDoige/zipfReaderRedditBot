Meeting Keanu Reeves at a traffic light

$C: He really is Reddit's favourite, good guy.
$C: How do you recognize him so quick at a light?  I would notice the motorcycle first and by the time I got to the face, they light would have changed.  I mean, I can tell that is him because I see the name but otherwise...I probably miss a lot in my life that way.
$C: Seems like Neo is everywhere on Reddit these days.
$C: And then just as suddenly, Keanu Leaves
$C: He acutally co-owns a bike company called Arch Motorcycle Company that makes badass custom motorcycles. 
    
About biking he says - 
   
"‚ÄúRiding your bike is one of the greatest things you can do to clear your head and just feel the speed and the motion,‚Äù said Reeves.

Unlike the many other riders out there, Reeves didn‚Äôt get into motorcycles until he was a young adult. As a teenager growing up in Toronto, Ontario, he was more into playing ice hockey than anything (he is, after all, a Canadian‚Äîeh).

‚ÄúI started when I was 22,‚Äù said Reeves. ‚ÄúI was filming in Munich, Germany, at this film studio, and this young girl had a gorgeous (Kawasaki) Enduro motorcycle which she would drive around. One day I asked her to teach me how to ride it. So I started to ride that bike around the stage when she wasn‚Äôt using it, and when I got back to Los Angeles, I got the first bike I saw that was similar. ."
    
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt go as fast as I used to,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a sense of fear, it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôve had enough accidents, a ruptured spleen, a lot of scraped skin and road rash that I don‚Äôt really feel the need to test the limits as much. I also don‚Äôt use riding a motorcycle as a way of getting rid of anger or frustration the way I used to. When I was younger, I used to get out on the road with the bike and just go as fast as I could and basically let it all out on the road. But after enough wipeouts, you begin to think that that‚Äôs not a really good frame of mind to be in when you‚Äôre riding a motorcycle at high speed (laughs).‚Äù"
$C: I don't care much about celebrities, but I'd definitely want to hang out with Keanu
$C: [deleted]
$C: Keanu Revs.
$C: I feel like most celebrities don't want to be noticed in public, but Keanu is like, "Look at me. Look. Directly. At. Me. I am Keanu *Reeves*."
$C: Where does the Keanu roam?  Is he mainly seen in LA? Bill Murray seems to follow random migratory habits , but is Keanu more often seen in one area ?
$C: *A wild Keanu appears*

Motorcycle is a 750 Norton Commando.
$C: I feel like this is the other pov of that "shia lebeuf at a stop light" meme.
$C: Keanu Reeves is suddenly freaking everywhere. This year is blessed üôè
$C: I'm a simple man. I see Keanu, I upvote. 
$C: A guy in Hollywood who isn't a total fuckhead. Cheers to Keanu.
$C: I wish Reddit would have a notification that goes "A Wild Keanu Has Appeared!"
$C: He just got accused by multiple women of being a complete gentleman. 
$C: Everyone's met this guy but me. Jk, I also met him when he toured with his Band DogStar back in 1997. He signed everything and took photos but he sure wasn't one for conversations. Kept to himself and would answer usually with just a simple yes or no when asked a question and that was that. Really quiet and reserved. Made me like him even more. 
$C: Dude is always chilling solo.
$C: He's everywhere on Reddit! Like the way cooler version of Where's Waldo.
$C: Keanu Reeves is the most non-celebrity, celebrity. Seems so down to earth and humble. I'd love to meet him one day.
$C: Kenau is someone who brings grace & respect to celebrity fraternity. 
$C: He looks just as excited to have run into you as well 
$C: I made eye contact with Keanu in an airport a few years ago. He smiled and in that moment I was euphoric.
$C: As a biker, it's very interesting to me that Keanu Reeves, with all his money and resources, and his *own motorcycle company that makes high end $80K+ bikes*, still rides an old kickstart Norton from the 70s.  That's really cool.  The dude's a true biker.
$C: I think the Keanu is aware the internet has been stalking him for some time now
$C: He‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúHey there (smiles genuinely), do I know you?‚Äù 

What a great guy. I‚Äôm glad Reddit says nice things about him because from what I‚Äôve read, he really is a kind man. 
$C: Not gonna lie, would have noticed that Norton before Keanu. 
$C: He's come a long way from that lonely park bench.
$C: I want this guy on Joe Rogan's podcast.
$C: Am I the only one who hasn't met Keanu?? 
$C: Looks like Ventura  Blvd and Coldwater Canyon next to the Ralph‚Äôs market. 
$C: As a regular dude that rides, if I pulled up to scope out a fuckin Norton Commando and saw that it was K-Reeves. Thatd make my day!


$C: This guy actually comes across as a genuine guy unlike many fake Hollywood celebs.
$C: I hope he knows Reddit loves him...

Dear Keanu,

If you are reading this, we love you, even if you are an immortal/appear to dont age/ probably are a vampire...

Love,
Reddit

http://www.keanuisimmortal.com/ 
$C: What an incredibly nice guy! To lean in and smile for some random persons camera like that, when you've been bombarded by them your whole career (more so in the last month) is just so awesome. 
$C: He‚Äôs the new mascot of Reddit. Reddit, lose the alien and just post new photos of Keanu Reeves everyday. 
$C: Keanu is getting ready to embark on an excellent adventure.
$C: Does Keanu Reeves have friends? How come he's never with anybody in any of these pictures?

Do you think all his friends are dead because the 1000 years old theory is true?
$C: Did Keanu say fuck it. Matrix residuals are enough, im just gonma ride around on my bike and take pics all day. 
$C: This intersection is Coldwater Canyon and Ventura Blvd. in the Studio City neighborhood of Los Angeles. They are driving westbound on Ventura Blvd.
$C: Are there *any* bad photos of this dude? I'm as straight as they come, but he makes me question my heterosexuality like no other.
$C: Keanu is like an easter egg reddit staff put randomly and the one who found him can get Karma as a prize
$C: Can he be the next ghost rider?
$C: What did you say to him?
$C: God damn, he is **the one**.  I'm an atheist, but this almost convinces me Jesus has returned to Earth and he is Keanu Reeves.
$C: I obviously don't know for sure but he really seems like a genuinely cool dude. I'd definitely chill with Keanu given the opportunity.
$C: God damn it why is he so cool?!
$C: Yep, he‚Äôs perfect. 
$C: Keanu Reeves for President 2020. He's got my vote.
$C: Find somebody who looks at you the way Keanu looks at...everyone, really

> May 17, 2014

> Many thanks to erinn_janee who shared the photo that she snapped of Keanu Reeves last night while he was out on the Norton and to @jmilahkarla who tweeted the link.  According to her comment, she was next to him at a red light.
$C: This should be used to promote motorcycle awareness. "Look twice for bikers, because you never know if they could be Keanu Reeves"
$C: If Keanu isn't too good for a helmet neither are you.  Ride safe.
$C: Keanu Reeves all over Reddit 
$C: A Norton Commando, nice. I'd chat him up at the stoplight too. Course I wouldn't know it was Keanu, I'd be too busy admiring the bike.
$C: It feels like Keanu Reeves is reddits cool uncle and comes to visit every now, cooks a nice dinner for everyone, tells a good story that makes you think and is off to another adventure the next day. 
$C: God Bless this man.
$C: I met Keanu Reeves in a line at an airport one time. He knocked over somebody's luggage in the most clumsy Keanu way and was super apologetic. Always nice to see famous people in the wild acting like a normal human
$C: Keanu Reeves wears a helmet while riding a motorcycle. No one can ever say they are ‚Äútoo cool for a helmet‚Äù after this.
$C: Did Keanu reeves recently come out of hibernation? 
$C: Bill Murray: ‚ÄúNo one will ever believe you.‚Äù

Keanu Reeves: ‚ÄúEveryone will believe you.‚Äù
$C: I like Keanu as much as the next guy, but why are we being flooded with Keanu stuff lately?

Is some PR firm pumping up Keanu posts for an upcoming movie or something?  
$C: He always looks like he could have you in a chokehold and still make it feel like a warm hug while you slip into the darkness.
$C: Keanu is going to become the Bill Murray of future generations
$C: What I want to know is how does everyone meet Keanu all the time.
$C: He got the John Wick beard
$C: I kinda just wish I could meet Keanu. Not going to happen where I'm at. Unless he is commonly found in remote desolate places...
$C: Keanu is a mythical creature that sometimes grants us mere mortals with his presence
$C: "Hey John, you working?"

...

"Yeah."

...

"I"'ll leave you to it then."
$C: Anytime I see a Keanu post on Reddit, it makes me happy for some reason. 
$C: Did you guys know that keanu reaves has his own motorbike company that makes kickass bikes 
$C: Can someone explain to me Reddit' s obsession with Keanu Reeves? IS it an ongoing joke that I missed? 
$C: I'm looking for Keanu every day of my life from here on out! Hope he visits Texas soon.
$C: Gorgeous bike 
$C: I feel like their needs to be a subreddit just for him. 
$C: just wanna know how he is everywhere. 
$C: Am I the only to of NOT met this glorious man?
$C: A Norton Commando! I loved that motorcycle growing up. I always thought the handle bars were so cool. Just when thought Keanu couldn't be any more badass... Nice bike man!
$C: No hoverhands?
$C: People let the man be, stop stalking Keanu Reeves. #LeaveKeanuAlone
$C: More like Keanu Revvs, right guys?
$C: You mean john wick.
$C: I would poop my pants
$C: Is Keanu the new Bill Murray?


$C: a shiny norton, that's  classy.
$C: UGH MY DREAM COME TRUE 
$C: Can there be a KeanuReeves sighting subreddit?
$C: Norton Commando, he has good taste in bikes. 
$C: r/motorcycles would dig this. Beautiful bike. 
$C: I love those british bikes. Norton's and triumphs. I was actually part of a documentry called the world's fastest Norton. 
$C: With all these Keanu sightings...2018 is gonna be a good year! Like a groundhog not seeing his shadow and getting an early spring. 
$C: Can we just make a sub r/KeanuEncounters
$C: I'm starting to think there are multiple Keanus, this dude is everywhere.
$C: My heart is soft for this man
$C: Good guy Keanu. He's actually pretty cool.

$C: It would be great if he led a class in how to be a good person. Lots of people out there need his class. He‚Äôs my favorite actor because of his acting and that he is good people. I wish only the very best for him
$C: Keanu is one of the few people in Hollywood that hasn't lost his connection to us common folk. Truly a rarity for an accomplished actor to actually take the time to appreciate every fan that has helped make his career successful despite how annoying it might be. Super humble dude and a fucking example of how real stars should act when confronted by the public
$C: Keanu Reeves is a real life meme. Good Guy. Thumbs Up
$C: Can we get a Keanu Reeves appreciation subreddit?
$C: Why does this seem to happen to everyone but me and where do I need to relocate in order to raise the odds of this happening?? 
$C: I heard he killed three men in a bar with a pencil. A FUCKING PENCIL!
$C: Damn that's a tiny bike. Johnny Utah needs a Harley. But on a serious note Keanu Reeves seems like a pretty awesome dude. 
$C: The man really is ‚Äúthe one‚Äù so few celebs seem to be able to deal with this shot and 99% of people I‚Äôm sure could not positively embrace public attention the way he does. He‚Äôs such a fucking badass. I know it‚Äôs been said a million times but here‚Äôs one more. To Keanu. 
$C: The light is red, Keanu Reeves. 
The light turns green, Keanu leaves. 
Through the traffic of life, 
Keanu weaves, Keanu weaves, Keanu weaves 
$C: Um, is this viral advertising for a Superbowl commercial?
$C: Meeting Keanu Reeves at a traffic light would be pretty cool, but I'd rather meet him at a dimly lit Italian restaurant in the nice part of town.


We would both joke how we are just meeting for food and for nothing else, but the mutual attraction would be palpable. We would both make small flirty comments, testing the waters more than anything. He would order the linguine, and I would order the beefiest lasagna the restaurant could offer. I would want him to know that I was no stranger to swallowing large amounts of meat. 


We would have a few glasses of wine, and drink them throughout dinner and for an hour afterwards. We would finish our second bottle and the flirting would have transitioned into blatant sexual propositioning. Keanu would get caught up in the moment, and detail how he would love to "have me bent over the dumpster in the alley out back," but then he would remember himself and blush. I would wink at him, and tell him I'd love to see him try, in a tone that was as flirty as it was challenging.


Minutes later, he would have his hand at the back on my neck, making good on the offer of having me face down on the dumpster. He would slip his hand onto my face, and although he would have slipped two fingers into my mouth so I could suck on them, I would still clearly and commandingly tell him to "take me" in the biblical sense. 


However, there would be nothing biblical about the depraved sexual acts that Keanu would perform on my welcoming body. He would fill every hole of mine with his sweet Keanu kum, and I would enjoy every second of it. He would have me screaming for more, and being the merciful sex god that he is, he would grant me my request. Round after round, hour after hour, he would dominate me like the whore that I am.


We would eventually end up in the back seat of my car, naked and exhausted. I would look at him longingly, and out of curiosity, I would ask, "Keanu, I didn't know you swung this way...I wouldn't have imagined you would know how to work another man's cock so well..."



He would look at me lovingly, and whisper to me, "Man, woman, animal...it makes no difference to me. I just like to fuck."
$C: Is it just me or has there been a massive increase in wild Keanu sightings recently?
$C: Would someone please explain why the fuck Keanu Reeves is on the front page every day lately??
$C: Given the constant stream of pictures of Keanu...can people just maybe leave him the fuck alone?
$C: What is the sudden fascination with Keanu? This must be some kind of a promotional stunt for an upcoming movie or something.

$C: No, Neo.  I'm saying when you're done, you won't need a windshield.
$C: Is this some kind of viral marketing? Why am I seeing Keanu everywhere. 
$C: Hey Vsouce, Micheal here 
$C: I usually don't give a shit about random shots of movie stars, but these Keanu ones be melting my heart for whatever reason.
$C: He seems like the kind of guy that would be genuinely curious about my after market sprocket or spring seat.  
$C: God i hope he's never jerked off in front of anyone
$C: Did he escape the hydrogen explosion?
$C: I think you meant Keanu "Revs."
$C: Here's a cool story about a [Norton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82iVMONcwss).
$C: I always find it weird that he can just be ‚Äúout there‚Äù like that.  No body guards?  No chauffeur?  Just by himself in the wild of the public?

Seems dangerous if you‚Äôre that famous tbh. 
$C: I wonder how many celebrities I have missed by not looking around when on the road.
$C: I wonder how many how many times he's on Google Street View? 
$C: He is living the shit out of life.
$C: TIL January is Keanu Reeves month on Reddit, I'm very okay with that
$C: Keanu Reeves is quickly becoming the new Bill Murray.
$C: Someone I would truly like to meet and spend an hour with.  And not because I want to question him about his film work (which, tbh, I don‚Äôt like 90% of it), but because I constantly see stories of him doing good deeds or being kind to others.  And this is a person I wish I could talk to.  Absorb some positivity from, and learn how to emulate as a human.
$C: it looks like the year is starting off with a lot of Keanu Reeves. i would love for the rest of this year to have tons of Keanu sightings all year long. KEANU 2018!!! 
$C: Is Neo paying people to follow him around or something? Matrix 4, reload again, confirmed?
$C: Helmet - check.  Jacket - check.  Cool guy - check.  
$C: Bruh hes beccome an apparition 
$C: Maybe the dude is just a fruit of our imagination appearing when we need him the most.
$C: Beautiful bike
$C: We don‚Äôt deserve him
$C: Mmmm, Norton Commando.  Loved those back in the day.  Keanu has good taste.
$C: I sincerely hope Keanu Reaves is reading these puns and chuckling over a glass of wine! 
$C: How many Keanu Reeves are there? He is everywhere lately! 
$C: That's a $29510.74 motorcycle. In case anyone was wondering. 
$C: Does he have a family? He's one of the coolest, kindest guys ever but is always pictured alone..
$C: Why is this man everywhere all of a sudden?
$C: All these posts on Reddit of him being a good samaritan are starting to make me wonder if he‚Äôs going to run for president against Donald trump or something  
$C: He actually looks happy in this picture. Normally these candid shots make him look bored. 
$C: Saint Keanu patron saint of the Matrix

$C: blasting guns yesterday and riding bikes today
$C: All these Keanu spottings. How do I summon him?! Do I need an alter or something?
$C: Dressed for the ride, not the slide.
$C: Damn he is hot. And so nice! So jealous of the person who got this picture.
$C: I declare 2018 year of the Keanu
$C: By far the most animated I've ever seen Keanu Reeves.
$C: Keanu needs to make an adult Mr. Rogers show and star in it. 
$C: Isawkeanu needs to be its own subreddit with the number of sightings lately 
$C: I love me some Keanu Reeves!
$C: How is everyone seeing him. Does be live everywhere.
$C: I wish he reads these!
$C: I think I'm the only one who hasn't met keenu now
$C: He owns his own motorcycle manufacturer, who makes incredible modern bikes, yet still bombs around on an old 70's Norton. This guy is a gem. 
$C: God bless you both
$C: ‚ÄúI can get 70 miles to the gallon on this hog.‚Äù
$C: Stop upvoting this paparazzi shit
$C: You have earned my like.
$C: Who notices a celebrity at a traffic light and pulls out their phone to obnoxiously photograph them? Ridiculously dickish behaviour.
$C: I'm pretty new to Reddit. Did Keanu Reaves found  this thing?! 

The adoration is well justified, I'm totally on board with smothering the fucker in love and karma. I'm just curious if it's official Reddit policy. ;) 

The Reddit shadow world has got this dude covered!  We love you, K-man! 
$C: There goes my hero.

He's ordinary.
$C: That's the Ralph's on Coldwater Canyon in Studio City. 
$C: Damn you‚Äôre lucky. I‚Äôd love to say hi to him. He seems so cool and nice
$C: This guy seems to be everywhere lately and that‚Äôs brilliant because all I‚Äôve heard is how much of a nice guy he is.

Makes a change to see a nice celebrity in the news.
$C: I wish he would drive a tank... I don't ever want to see this man taken from us early :(
$C: This would be one of my most wished celebrity encounters...that and meeting Michael Shannon.
$C: At this point we should just make a Keanu Reeves subreddit since he seems to be everywhere
$C: Is this man omnipresent?
$C: Being a lifelong motorcyclist and knowing Keanu is an avid rider always made me like him even more, just like Ewan Macgregor... however, seeing him on a Norton puts me over the top.

Say what you will about his acting, everything I‚Äôve ever heard about the guy puts him in my top ten list of nicest/coolest/best celebrities.
$C: I feel like I'm the only one on Reddit that hasn't met Keanu. :(
$C: Looks like John Wick 3 is starting off on a good foot.
$C: Out of the loop: why is Keanu all-over Reddit all of a sudden?
$C: ‚ÄúPardon me sir, but you wouldn‚Äôt happen to have any Gray Poupon would you?‚Äù
$C: Keanu Reeves is the most interesting man in the world.
$C: Hey and hes riding a Norton and NOT a triumph!  Nice job!
$C: I hope this never stops. 2018, the year of Keanu Reeves
$C: WOAH
$C: He‚Äôs a great perosn
$C: Where do you guys live that you find random celebrities just loitering around on the streets?
$C: Is he turning into Bill Murray?
$C: He's part owner of a motorcycle company yet he on a tiny British bike. 
$C: I feel like Keanu always makes the top page because hes just such a good dude we want to upvote him, regardless of how interesting the post is. Keanu eating a sandwhich? Fuck yeah upvote that dude is awesome
$C: At this point I‚Äôm starting to think Keanu is just going up to random people telling them to take a pic and post it to Reddit
$C: I feel like Keanu is taking the celebrity-you-have-random-encounters-with baton from Bill Murray.
$C: Lmao Keanu Reeves is winning 2018 so far 
$C: How does everyone find this man? My sister saw him recently too
$C: It probably goes without saying but Keanu Reeves is a fucking national treasure.
$C: Holy shit 96k likes in 3 hours! If there is one thing reddit can agree on it‚Äôs Keanu 
$C: Does he kno da wae

$C: I rode with Keanu through the hills of Malibu once, from Neptune's Net on Pacific Coast Highway, up to Mulholland Drive and past the Rock Store. 

Well, okay, maybe he didn't know we were riding together since I was about 100 yards behind him the whole way, but I knew. We were bros for a day.
$C: By the amount of recent pictures of Keanu, I‚Äôm convinced there are at least 8 of him.
$C: Okay Reddit I'm finally going to ask: what's up with Keanu Reeves and Reddit? For the past couple weeks I have been frequently almost daily seeing him on the front page
$C: We need to start a Keanu Scrapbook. 
$C: "Sorry about your dog!"
$C: Much more friendly than Shia
$C: Is everyone stalking this man? Recent photos of him are showing up daily on the front page.
$C: At this point I feel like I‚Äôm the only one who hasn‚Äôt ran into Keanu Reeves at some point.
$C: Why is everybody meeting Keanu Reeves now?
$C: Keanu Reeves deserves to be a ‚Äúgood guy‚Äù meme. Can someone make it happen.
$C: I really love how this guy dont give a damn about fame/paparazi ... just live his life.
$C: What did we do to deserve Keanu?
$C: Take notes kids.  Even Neo wears a helmet.
$C: Keanu!!!!! You glorious bastard!! 
$C: I don't know what this guy's problem is but being this level of cool should be illegal.
$C: How can you **not** like this guy? He‚Äôs always smiling, friendly with fans, and never fails to impress with his genuine kindness.
$C: Ventura Blvd @ Coldwater Canyon
$C: Is Keanu Reeves the new Bill Murray?
$C: I would of tried to high five him or blow him a kiss. Whatever.
$C: Keanu Reeves... What a dude. 
$C: I thought it said Keanu revs at traffic light
$C: TIL if you post enough Keanu pics, eventually you‚Äôll get all the upvotes. 
$C: Definitely the coolest celeb around. Seems like a top man.
$C: If John Wick looks at you, you look away.
$C: I think Keanu Reeves is just trolling Redditors at this point!
$C: Man, it'll suck if one day he gets panned as a sex offender too
$C: He always smiles for photos, then disappears until someone catches him again.
$C: Keanu is one of the coolest guys ever 
$C: We need to cherish this man.
$C: The tree and the light behind Keanu lofiks like explosion. And Keanu being Keanu didn't look back
$C: Keanu sightings have gone up 1,000%, are we in the Matrix?

$C: I wonder of he has has Reddit and saw this 
$C: Man I wish I could just randomly meet Keanu Reeves at a stop light or the train, he seems like just such a good dude, always been one of my favorite actors!
$C: I knew it. He's the one... 
$C: Love the bike too.  My stepdad had a Norton Commando my mom sold for a couple hundred bucks 25 years ago.  So sad she did that, would have loved to restore a beauty like that.
$C: Does this guy have a home?  He‚Äôs never home!  Traveling...traveling...  Poor Keanu!  
$C: i thought this was markiplier
$C: What spurred Reddit‚Äôs obsession with Keanu? Will someone please catch me up on this...
$C: Is Keanu riding around LA looking for reddit karma? I swear this is like the fifth topic with him on the front page in two weeks.

Or maybe someone is trying to start a Keanu sighting subreddit.
$C: He's everywhere......everywhere.
$C: u/unknown_human .. now you have become known .. change your name 
$C: Thaks Keanu for being Keanu
$C: I love him! You know he actually takes public transportation as well! Donates most of his earnings and does majority of his own stunts! I want to marry this man! Or at least one day meet him at a stop light üòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è
$C: Honestly, he is the most chill guy ever
$C: Keanu is the best.
$C: Love Keanu seems like an awesome guy!
$C: What‚Äôs up with everyone seeing Keanu Reeves everywhere? 
$C: He just pops up everywhere
$C: Brit bikes are awesome! That Norton he's riding is a really sweet ride. 
$C: Holy crap! I'd be impressed just seeing a 70s Norton.
$C: Fuck this guy is so cool
$C: As someone who has adored Mr Reeves since Bill & Ted's, it's so great that he has held up his reputation as a standup guy, unlike so many others lately.  
$C: You cut him off on the road, now John Wick will cut off your life.
$C: He seems like the nicest world famous multi-millionaire you're ever going to meet.. 
$C: It looks like he can't quite believe it either. 
$C: John motherfucking Wick
$C: TIL Reeves wears Alfani
$C: Sod Keanu Reeves, what about that Norton Commando , it‚Äôs beautiful 
$C: Can we officially change the game "Where's Waldo" to "Where's Keanu"
$C: i swear meeting keanu reeves somewhere is becoming a meme
$C: I see Keanu, I upvote. Simple as that.
$C: Yet the motorcycle tells his whole story, I wish that was the main stream for the comments! Good picture though!
$C: Another jesus sighting.
$C: 2018 don't you dare reveal any Keanu scandels. Reddit wouldn't be able to handle it.
$C: There are almost enough of these pics popping up to warrant a separate subreddit.
$C: 2018 is truly the year of Keanu Reeves.
$C: He seems happier lately! 
$C: Keanu Reeves seems to be omnipresent with all of these post about him on Reddit recently
$C: Why is reddit sniffing this guys ass all the time. Wtf did i miss? 
$C: He has to ride that bike because they stole his car and killed his dog
$C: Ok I've been kinda non-committal on the whole good guy Keanu bit, I don't know the dude so who knows what his deal is.

But he has damn near unlimited toy funds, is American, and still chose a 750 commando to go cruising on? I'm on board. His choice could not be any more perfect.
$C: [I mean like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpr8oqyjKIc)
$C: Why is reddit sniffing this guys ass all the time. Wtf did i miss? 
$C: He needs to marry me already. 
$C: Fuck me sideways that's a beautiful bike he's got. The man has had excellent taste in bikes for years.
$C: Upvoted just before this post gets archived!
$C: Have you heard about his actual martial arts experience being what made John Wick so good, or seen the video where is good at shooting stuff, or read about him owning his own motorcycle shop? Because you will about 100 times in this comments section. 

Seriously though he is awesome.
$C: I‚Äôll never understand the need to bother celebrities when they are on their own time.  I‚Äôve encountered a few in my lifetime, and what do I do?  Leave them the f**k alone.  I don‚Äôt take pictures and I certainly don‚Äôt approach them.  
$C: Keanu is showing up on reddit and social media an awful lot lately. Particularly with his motorcycles and in his riding gear. Seems to me there is a pretty strong social media campaign being put together here... /r/hailcorporate

EDIT: The fact that there is a big fat dot between the upvote/downvote arrows, and that th8s post is only a little over an hour old, also seems to indicate that there is something special in the Reddit algorithm that allows this to rise to the top of /r/all. Frankly, I don't have a clue how the Reddit potion works (nor do I give it much thought), but it's easy enough recognize when something is outside normal patterns.

EDIT 2: Oh. Look. I seem to have upset someone. Suddenly the post isn't anywhere to be found on my feeds. Yet, in private/incognito mode it's still right there at the top of reddit.

EDIT 3: Hmm. I don't think I've ever managed to rustle the hornets nest with a comment on Reddit before. Seems I've touched a nerve. /u/unknown_human doesn't like being called out on (likely paid) social media manipulation.
$C: Love this guy but the jewish mother in me is shaking its head that he still rides a bike after his horrible accident that left him with multilevel fusions
$C: The Norton doesn't suit him. I understand the collectability factor of one of these classics but he would suit a much bigger bike. I am sure his collection of motorbikes is pretty awesome. I'm just saying... He looks like someone's big brother who stole his baby brother/sisters toy
$C: How many days in a row can Keanu make the front page? Let's keep it going! 
$C: Why are there so many posts about Keanu right now?
$C: goddamnit Keanu, ATGATT buddy. Im worried about someone that cool mixing it up in traffic without at least a full helmet 
$C: Keanu Reeves and Terry Cruise are loved by Reddit so much. <3
$C: Reddit has the biggest erection ever for Keanu.

Scroll down for stories about how he's so amazing, in spite of having had a hard life.
$C: Who gives a fuck?
$C: Man I hate posts like this. This is just a person on a bike. This celebrity cult is such a nonsense.
$C: All these Keanu posts. 

One might think that this is some form of marketing campaign.
$C: My motorcycle spirit tells me to challenge him , brrrmmm brrrrmmm 
 
But he is the choosen one, i know i cant win
$C: Keanu 2020
$C: I wish that I could meet Keanu at least once in my life
$C: Stay safe out there Mr Reeves
$C: That Norton is sah-weet
$C: That bike is sooo kick ass.

But he looks extremely cramped on it.
$C: He's ex communicado now. Better steer clear of him.
$C: Well that's an excellent adventure.
$C: He's everywhere!
$C: He owns a company that builds completely custom motorcycles by hand built specifically for the rider. Some of the shit that rolls out of that shop is legendary.
$C: Legend
$C: Is it me or has Keanu Reeves been showing up everywhere lately? Maybe there is more than one Keanu.....and they've come to save us all.
$C: You better have bowed down to Lord Keanu!
$C: Did you race him? He looks like he wants to race.
$C: He looks like he could fight some bad guys right now.
$C: I would just like to say, "Thank you for being awesome." 
$C: I hope his face is well insured.
$C: I'm kind of surprised to see him on a Norton considering he owns his own [motorcycle company](https://www.archmotorcycle.com/).
$C: We don't deserve him
$C: good guy Keanu.
$C: Which pill did you take?
$C: My daddy
$C: Up votes for everyone!
$C: Why can't i randomly meet celebrities like him? 



Oh yeah...wrong continent. 
$C: riding a Norton none the less, pretty cool
$C: Definitely wanna go riding with that dude. He seems cool as hell!
$C: I like how down-to-earth Keanu seems. I hear so many people relate positive anecdotes about him. 
$C: He just gets cooler n cooler
$C: Ahh, the 750 Commando, great bike. I did a lot of miles on mine.
$C: What a humble man, much respect. 
$C: Haha awesome !
$C: Whoa...
$C: oh yeah he doesn't age...
$C: Makes me happy to see Keanu smiling and enjoying himself. 

A lot of the photos/videos about him really make me feel sad about how much shit he's had to deal with. He always seems to be the nicest guy around, but also the most heartbroken. 
$C: Is there a subreddit strickly for Keanu posts? If not there definitely should be. The real Golden God.
$C: We need to have daily Keanu posts from whomever out there sees him, so we can feed positive energy into ourselves from it.
$C: Half expecting to get home and find Keanu Reeves sat on my sofa. 
$C: Can we just get this religion started with Keanu at our lord and savior?  
$C: And he's wearing a helmet on his motorcycle. Is there a good example he can't show? 
$C: This is just getting ridiculous now. I can only assume that there are multiple Keanus out there for there to be this many encounters 
$C: Woah!
$C: Do you think he realises how many times he's been on the front page already this year?
$C: Did he reeve the engine?
$C: Can we get a Keanu Reeves/Tom Hanks buddy flick? They are probably the most loved nice guys in Hollywood and I feel like the world needs to see them together so we can fall in love all over again. 
$C: ‚ÄúHey didn‚Äôt I just see you on the front page of reddit?‚Äù
$C: Keanu Rides
$C: That Norton 750 Commando was one of the baddest bikes around back in the day. Classic cool.
$C: Keanu new Reddit king confirmed
$C: How's his dog?
$C: Not pictured the people screaming behind them. The light is fucking green!
$C: I wonder what Keanu did to be so well liked. I believe he is an everlasting beige like some people say. 
$C: Thankfully it‚Äôs not sad Keanu today! 
$C: I haven't seen a Norton Commando on the road since the 1970s. Does anyone know if this is original or something from one of the companies that used the Norton name?
$C: this is my dream
$C: Keanu is what happens when a good person has a lot of money.
$C: WTF.  This dude is all over reddit lately.  And he looks like a badass in every pic.
$C: May the roads keep him safe. May his steel stallion ride like the wind. 
$C: He actually helped found and owns a motorcycle company that builds and sells custom motorcycles. Something like Arch Motorcycle I think. He‚Äôs really passionate about motorcycles, I thought that was pretty cool. 
$C: This guy is everywhere! 6 degrees of Keanu
$C: The coolest human being, that ever lived. 
$C: In my own world he would extend his hand to me, and we would both ride off to never ever land 
$C: Keanu + motorcycle = happy Keanu
$C: Sure would like to meet the guy
$C: This guy is the best celebrity..i feel like if Keanu Reeves was someones hero and they met him they would not be dissapointed
$C: He's been popping up on Reddit a lot lately.
$C: Keanu is so kind and genuine he could probably do something like murder and be found innocent because "he didn't mean to". Love this guy!
$C: Why the fuck is this man everywhere. 
$C: Awesome
$C: I nominate Keanu for ambassador of Reddit.
$C: i love this guy. An absolute legend
$C: Cool
$C: I wish that he gets to visit Malaysia someday. Would love to know what does he thinks of our durian.
$C: Is that keanu reeves trying to be Sacha baron cohen or vice versa???
$C: God damn it, he is just so impossibly nice and cool.
$C: All I want in life is to accidentally meet Keanu. He gives me hope in humanity & actually makes me want to be a better person. 
$C: There is no spoon.
$C: Is Keanu even real
$C: People can meme all they want, you can definitely tell he's getting older.
$C: What a wonderful human
$C: Is it just me or is everyone meeting Keanu Reeves.
$C: Seems like everyone meets him 
$C: Keanu, a guy that Reddit loves!
$C: One of the only celebraties i love seeing get more social media attention. The guy is an absolute lad.
$C: Keanu is everywhere and he's awesome. 
$C: His New Year's resolution? Get his picture taken by as many people as he can. 
$C: "A day without motorcycling is a wasted day" probably Kenau
$C: Ok, when‚Äôs the next Keanu movie coming out?
$C: Sometimes I wonder if he's even real because he is amazing 
$C: You sure it's not Mr. Robot?
$C: Your a lucky guy!
$C: Keanu Reeves, Reddits official celebrity crush, I don't complain though.
$C: Dude, Reddit loves Keanu Reeves








and so do i.
$C: Seems like Keanu reeves is a really cool dude :) 
$C: What a sweet bike too 
$C: Why‚Äôs everyone on Reddit always meeting Keanu - this guy is everywhere. 
$C: Norton ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
$C: keanu 2018 seems like such an optimistic keanu
$C: Hey, you....  
    
Do you need directions?
$C: With the helmet on, I would be all 'who the hell is staring at me, should I find a police station?'

$C: He seems to be popping up everywhere...
$C: Keanu is out and about these days.
$C: Keanu Reevs feels like he is quickly becoming the new Bill Murray.
$C: What‚Äôs just as cool is Shawn let Keanu ride his Norton. Some of that Magic Head influence. 
$C: Be careful, he knows kung fu.
$C: This Keanu Reeves posts are getting out of hand
$C: I just wanna High Five him. Because he's such a great Guy
$C: I feel like at this point Mr. Reeves should be on the mount Rushmore of reddit.
$C: On a norton as well! What a guy!!
$C: He's just the best actor of all time. I really hope he isn't a pedo, too. 
$C: Classic old Norton, too!
$C: u/boganwithakeyboard 
$C: He definitely knows da wae of de devil 
$C: I‚Äôm beginning to think Keanu is everywhere.. at all times
$C: Really bad photoshop
$C: When something is *actually* very badass.
$C: I'm convinced Keanu is setting these pictures up himself. There are rapid fire pictures of him in public posted on this site and I think he's orchestrating it. This man is a goddamn genius and manipulating us all for that sweet, sweet karma
$C: Keanu has been all over the front page lately and I‚Äôm loving it 
$C: Keanu is the patron saint of Reddit
$C: He's actually inside the matrix there
$C: This guy is everywhere. Dang.
$C: Nice bike 
$C: It seems like Keanu Reeves is the new Chuck Norris.
$C: A Keanu post on reddit a day will keep the doctor away.
$C: Dude has got to be the chilliest celeb out there.  He seems un corrupted unlike the rest of Hollywood (and by corruption I'm not JUST referring to the sexual harassment era that we are in)
$C: Caption: "Have you seen my dog?" 
$C: I hope he knows Reddit loves him
$C: As some point isn‚Äôt this just advertising? Idk this just seems forced at this point
$C: Keanu high Speedes
$C: The year of Keanu 
$C: Out of the way paparazzis, Reddit is in town
$C: Damn, the Keanu Reeves circlejerk is strong these days.
$C: Man Keanu has been on the home page everyday lately lol
$C: I've been seeing a lot of Keanu an Reddit recently.

I'm expecting a John Wick 3 trailer soon.
$C: this guy can't get any cooler
$C: that bike is so cool
$C: He seems like a cool guy
$C: That... almost looks like he's smiling.

Good for him
$C: You are good and you should feel good!
$C: Okay, seriously: is reddit just stalking him now?
$C: "Look at me...Look at me. I'm the Reddit Captain now."
$C: *I swear to god everyone on Reddit has met Keanu Reeves but me :(*
$C: thats john wick :o
$C: Who is this fellow by the way??? üòÉü§îü§î
$C: This is ü¶Ü- ing shit!!!! 
$C: This guy is breaking the internet
$C: It wasn't just any dog, it was John Wick' s fucking dog. 
$C: Snortin' Norton.  Nice bike.  He's got good taste.  
$C: He‚Äôs got to be the chillest celeb ever
$C: Although the start of 2018 has been very bleak so far, I've gotta say on reddit Keanu has been very relevant this past week. (However, I'm not surprised as he seems to be such a cool dude)
$C: He took the blue pill 
$C: Why is this guy just the best guy
$C: Glad to see he is wearing a helmet, gloves, and boots. Smart man
$C: That looks more like Ted Theodore Logan to me.
$C: This should lead to a Jay Leno's Garage episode. That bike looks cool.
$C: this fuckin dude

$C: Definitely Not Markiplier
$C: His thighs are a lot shorter than expected.
$C: 2018 is the year of Keanu
$C: What a man. Was he as he always is?
$C: That's an awesome photo
$C: That would be awesome 
$C: I see a vampire I upvote.
$C: It's amazing how Keanu just keeps on keepin' on!
$C: Now we just have to wait for the lovely stories about him.
$C: He' so likable
$C: Next week it'll be "I randomly came across Keanu Reeves in his own home"
$C: Looks like he knows you, now that he‚Äôs conquered the world of acting and breakfast sausages 
$C: I think he's a nice guy
$C: At this point, let's change the site from reddit to Keanu.com
$C: I don't know anything about motorcycles...is that a particularly interesting model in some way?  I read the wikipedia article, but it doesn't tell me much about why this model would be desirable.  Is it hard to get?  Super comfortable?  Really cool for some reason (other than the fact that Keanu Reeves is on it)?
$C: He seems like a genuinely nice person. The only movie star I've ever met was Danny DeVito and he rubbed my girlfriend's ass ... really couldn't blame him to be honest.
$C: More like ‚ÄúSee-ya-l8r Reeves‚Äù
$C: I feel like pictures of him get taken in random places by random people so often it deserves it's own subredddit xD
$C: Is that TKB? 
$C: Can we keep this trend where a picture of Keanu Reeves reaches the front page every day?

Definitely loving it.
$C: nice bike.
$C: A Norton is exactly right for him
$C: Let me guess , your convo went like this:

You: " good evening John "
Keanu: : " good evening Jimmy "

Keanu: "noise complain"?
You: "noise complain.."
You: (quick look arround on bike....) "You errrr, riding again???"

Keanu: "nahh! I'm just sorting some stuff out"
You : " ohhhh, well I will leave you than. Good night John"
Keanu: "good night Jimmy".


Clip for this here: https://youtu.be/szZ2A0LvsLI




$C: Is it just me, or does that really look like it could be anyone? Not Keanu?
$C: And he's riding the exact bike I wanted since I was a child. I need to finally get one now that I'm all grown up Mr. Man and stuff.
$C: Reddit's love affair with Keanu will down as one of the greats, up there with Bogie and Bacall, Taylor and Burton, and Dick and Butt.
$C: I had a dream last night where a friend and I watched Keanu Reeves get arrested. That's when I knew it was a dream.
$C: He can't even ride in traffic without being stopped for pictures, I can't imagine what that kind of life is
$C: Why is Keanu Reeves popping up on Reddit so much this week?
$C: I can‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs him! Lol
$C: Keanu Reeves has been on the front page so many times this week
$C: ‚ÄúWhat number am I thinking of right now‚Äù
$C: Wow, that is a cool ride. a vintage one.
$C: He seems like such a nice man, I hope all this Keanu Hunting isn‚Äôt bumming him out.
$C: What a cool dude who lives a fun life! Ride on Keanu
$C: He sure looks like he knows how to party, and I dig it. 
$C: this is going to be the next 40-50 years for him. I'm glad that he appears to 2b a good sport about this.
$C: *rider Keanu wants to battle*
$C: Damn he's cool
$C: Holy shit this guy is everywhere. I‚Äôm starting to think Neo has mastered replication.
$C: Being a motorcyclist as well that is a little dream to run into him or really any other celebrity that rides. 
$C: Is that a commando? Dunno why I find it weird seeing a movie star on a Norton in 2018. 

Must be so weird having your picture taken everywhere you go tho.  
$C: This man is a walking Reddit goldmine
$C: Keanu Reeves has been popping up a lot lately. 
$C: Kool!
$C: Officer Grover: ‚ÄúSir you ran a red light...oh shi...Keanu!‚Äù

Keanu: ‚ÄúI read blitz‚Äù
$C: He has such great taste in vehicles! He also has a Porsche 993 4S!
$C: Leave this fucking guy alone Jesus Christ everyday there‚Äôs a og post about bothering him so you can tell reddit. 
$C: He's so fucking nice. I want to meet him!
$C: Woah
$C: From 2014?  
$C: Ventura Blvd & Coldwater Canyon in Studio City, CA.
$C: this guy right now
$C: Also kinda look like a skinny version of Jeffrey Dean Morgan.
$C: But hes dressed for the ride, not the slide :(

$C: we love him!
$C: What is up with all the Keanu posts?
$C: Keanu Reeves probably ran across dozens of dead bodies and we would never know about it. Such a great guy 
$C: Thank god he is immortal. :') Long live Keanu
$C: Damn... what's with all these Keanu Sightings?
$C: Getting that photo opportunity is like getting free pizza!
$C: Disappointed that he doesn‚Äôt ride an arch motorcycle (he owns the company)
$C: We should just make Keanu Reddit's mascot. 
$C: I hope he lives in an area where motorcycle riding is fairly safe... Don't want to lose this national treasure.
$C: That's bad ass.  His bike is bad ass too.  What were you riding?

Keanu seems like a really cool dude and knowing that he's huge into bikes (even has his own company that produces them) makes him even cooler.
$C: So that's who Shia LaBeouf met.
$C: Very Cool
$C: This dude is my hero
$C: "It is a pleasure having you with us again, Mr. Wick" 


$C: Is this a new meme? Meeting Keanu Reeves in everyday life?
$C: I like that this guy loves motorcycle's, there should be more advocating their love for the two wheels.
$C: It's buzz marketing, and we're the product.
$C: Plot twist: they had a green light and he did this all while moving
$C: This site has such a hard on for Keanu
$C: A glitch in the Matrix
$C: How are so many people bumping into him!?
$C: How are so many people bumping into him!?
$C: Why did you take his pic without his permission?
$C: On a Norton. Man has taste
$C: Where is the meme economy post about putting all your karma into Keanu posts.
$C: Is that the bike from "My own personal Idaho"?
$C: What's the deal with hippos? 
$C: It's great that he willingly agreed to let some unkown person take a photo of him.

This guy is my IDOL!!!!!
$C: Is 2018 the year of the Keanu or something?
$C: And now he is sad Keanu
$C: he looks too big for that bike.  He should just give it to me and get himself something a bit larger.
$C: Wth this guy is everywhere lmao people keep posting pics of seeing him like its some epic achievement accomplished. 
$C: This guy seems to be everywhere! 
$C: The man just needs to be elected president and get it over with he is such a good human being
$C: Look at how much positive energy this guy brings just by being posted in reddit.. this thread is an example of that
$C: So chill this dude
$C: Paid your speeding ticket?
$C: He is everywhere! 
$C: Keanu is omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent.
$C: I'm beginning to wonder if he's even real
$C: He must have a few Nortons.  The 850 he rode in My Own Private Idaho was his as well.
$C: Never heard of her
$C: He's so cool! I love how humble he is too. I mean just look at him! I don't know anything about that bike in particular, but he isn't riding around all flashy "Look At Me!" Or anything. Here's just a dude, riding a bike, jeans, helmet and awesomeness. I want to be his friend.
$C: "John wick 3: hidden in plain sight"
$C: He looks like one of those Eastern Europeans chasing down homeboy in The Transporter movies only he doesn‚Äôt have an uzi.

Edit: added an indefinite article and a period.
$C: Sherman Oaks?
$C: Man he‚Äôs everywhere this year
$C: He seems to be everywhere xD. On bus stops, airports, now on motorcycles. Guy seems to like traveling.
$C: This one time when I was a kid I swear I saw Clint Eastwood in a truck at the Piggly Wiggly in Abilene TX and Kevin Costner on a golf cart at a flea market. Pretty sure I had a pretty vivid imagination.
$C: Keanu is becoming Bill Murray-esque.
$C: Ventura and coldwater?
$C: Thought it was Vsauce Micheal for a second lol
$C: Oh shit. 
$C: R/watchpeopledie 
I Am just posting this cause u can't search it anymore 
$C: Nice to see.. ....
$C: He looks less scary with goggles and a helmet 
$C: This guy is everywhere! 
$C: these ads for keanu reeves movies are getting out of control 
$C: man this guy is getting around lol
$C: If not me, I hope atleast my grandkids get to meet this man. He probably wouldn't have aged a day. He is my greatest source of motivation and whenever I see a post with him, I cheer up :)
$C: *He's starting to believe*
$C: Idve killed a man for this
$C: I mean, he's a cool guy and all, but maybe you guys should leave him alone one day of the week.
$C: He truly is The One.
$C: Classic bike too. He seems chill 
$C: Well, fuck Keanu me... za. 
$C: My dad would cry if he saw this, the one regret he has in life is selling his Norton just like that around 1990 for a Harley.
$C: That Keanu‚Äôs really getting around lately. 
$C: Are we collectively stalking Keanu?
$C: Norton 750 Commando. Awesome bike and, of course , Keanu! 
$C: He has good taste in motorcycles!
$C: I met him once outside of a movie theater. No video, no camera. Just a quick hello. He had just seen The Departed and I was going into it. He couldn‚Äôt have been more friendly. I think it‚Äôs awesome that so many people  get to see things like this, or the subway video.  He‚Äôs a legit good person!
$C: Have you met Keanu‚Äôs butler Jeeves?
$C: Why I am seeing Keanu Reeves everywhere lately, said every redditer!
$C: Keep your hands where I can see them, Keanu!
$C: Cool!
$C: Okay, who HASN'T met Keanu, I feel like Im the only one now.
$C: I never realised I wanted a keanu Reeves ghost rider in the mcu until now
$C: Keanu is the new Bill Murray.
$C: Why so many pics of him lately?
$C: Why does Keanu Reeves ride a motorcycle?

Because there‚Äôs a bomb on the bus. 

***rim shot
$C: Wild Reeves appears!
$C: Is he the one who took the picture?
$C: Nice commando.
$C: In the parlor he will polish his piano keys.
$C: Woah. This is yet another post about Keanu. He seems to get around quite often 
$C: One of the only Hollywood dudes I'd be surprised to find of any sexual harassment claims.
$C: I think he managed to clone himself like agent smith with the rate of his appearance on Reddit...
$C: Isn't this weird... filming someone with a camera (phone)? I don't know... Seems odd... I saw Manuel Neuer in Munich, pulled out my phone, but changed my mind... after thinking about what would it be for me being stalked with people constantly looking for a good shot/selfie opportunity
$C: Wyld Stallyns!
$C: The man is a national treasure
$C: Is it me or is this man everywhere?
$C: He‚Äôs still my #1. ‚ù§Ô∏è
$C: I feel like we get a new "Keanu in his daily life" pic everyday here on reddit.. And I love it. 
$C: He's smiling. Must be an imposter. 
$C: I‚Äôm a simple man. I see Keanu I like Keanu... and talk about how he doesn‚Äôt age. 
$C: For the guy who owns a huge collection I find it funny he's on a Norton 850 commando. 
$C: I'm pretty sure that's actually Casanova from Project Runway.
$C: Mfw I don‚Äôt live anywhere near him so I can‚Äôt get all the sweet sweet reddit karma....

I mean at least I live where he was born, but still..
$C: We need a Keanu Christ mega thread. 
$C: Because deep down, their darkest truths, Keanu Believes
$C: What a dorky helmet
$C: He‚Äôs just so cute ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
$C: When I was a kid my step dad had a Norton 750 Commando in yellow and black and chrome. I think it was a 1976. I remember that was the first bike I ever got to ride on the back of, and it was the coolest thing I'd ever seen in my life. He kept it clean as a whistle (He was a retired USMC instructor, so he had a pretty keen eye for detail) and I always admired what a thing of power and beauty it was.

My mom made him sell it because she thought motorcycles were too dangerous. She divorced him 4 years later, then went out and got her bike license & now has 3 different bikes. (She's not always the most rational person) None of them are as sweet as that old '76 Commando in yellow and black was though.
$C: this dude is the shit 
$C: Why no upvotes?
$C: Do we really know it‚Äôs him? His face is obstructed by a helmet and glasses. Of course, it can also be a glitch in the matrix!
$C: Badass picture and badass timing!
$C: Best thread ever? Keanu believed
$C: What the heck? This guy is everywhere.
$C: For a second I thought that tree behind him was a plume of smoke and  Keanu was just sitting there with a guilty look, like 'if you tell anyone about this your house is next'
$C: Riding a Norton 750...what a sweet old bike.
$C: Looks more like Cotton, the announcer from dodgeball, but f‚Äôin a that‚Äôs a bold strategy to not look at the light like that
$C: He lives in New York, right? Im fairly certain it's easy to catch him out and about when he's not filming. 
$C: This doesn‚Äôt go here 
$C: He is the new Bill murray
$C: LAL nic
$C: My dad has that bike. It roars like a tiger!
$C: Ok guys calm the fuck down or he is going to start to think that we are stoking him
$C: Was he working???
$C: This needs to be a sub Reddit already. A series of people just posting pictures of Meeting Keanu, ‚Äúand I‚Äôm goi g to give it to them.‚Äù
$C: R/KeanuReeves
$C: Can we just elect Keanu Reeves as Reddit's next fad celebrity crush already?
$C: The rhyming got really corny after a bit LOL 
$C: I wasn't sure before, but i'm sure now. Keanu Reaves signed up for some viral marketing campaign and this and the previous photo of him paying tickets are staged. 
$C: It must be really annoying to have people constantly taking your picture.  Imagine, every time you stop at a stop light, someone is trying to take your picture. Every time you sit on the subway, someone is trying to take your picture. 

$C: If I ever win the lotto I'm funding another matrix movie. No doubt. 
$C: Why are so many people meeting keanu Reeves lately?
$C: whoa dude
$C: I‚Äôm guessing Keanu is the king of Reddit for 2018.  I‚Äôve seen him on here about three times a day.
$C: This honestly looks like it could be Markiplier.
$C: His marketing team is hard at work! 
$C: We need a subreddit for him
$C: Lucky duck
What city is this?
$C: Next week we'll have someone with the following post: Met Keanu pissing next to me in a urinal.... Leave Keanu alone!!! Lol
$C: All these pictures make me feel like he never goes or stays home. Is that why hes the one
$C: His head is a bit too big and the posture is awkward, it looks photoshopped...
$C: Does this guy just magically appear anywhere someone is taking a selfie or random photo?
$C: we need a "i spotted keanu reeves" or "a wild keanu appears" subreddit please
$C: Norton Commando a classic British Bike, Neo get my up vote for that!!
$C: hes the ONE.... we want in 2020

the best part is, you know he'll be against it.

hell, if we elect him, he may even try to run away.

but we need neo in the white house.
$C: More like Keanu meets /u/unknown_human  at a traffic light
$C: Ventura and Coldwater? 
$C: Dude has style.

I honestly feel like if I pulled up next to him on my own bike that we would just get along fine
$C: Is that Ventura and coldwater canyon?
$C: The man is an enigma...
$C: I like Keanu
$C: this dude is seemingly everywhere
$C: I‚Äôve seen too many of these posts lately, is this guy some sort of spirit who appears when you utter an incantation a la ‚Äòbloody Mary‚Äô or is he just so good that he is the only Human worthy of being cloned?
$C: Of course he rides a Norton. What a badass. 
$C: Great dude right there. 
$C: Angel Wings Confirmed!
$C: Such a cool bike
$C: Wow.  I have that same bike.  I'd talk his ear off about it
$C: The year of Keanu is upon us 
$C: Would you even believe it yourself if it happened to you? I mean, fucking Keanu Reeves....I‚Äôd be in less disbelief if I saw Jesus.

$C: Something , something, his new movie
$C: Does he have friends? I never see him with anyone. 
$C: Heck is going on, this guy has gone from never been seen on the net to you cant surf without see him somewhere...


Least that is how I think it is...
$C: Keanu, Tom Hanks and Jeff Goldblum are my 3 favorite actors and people in the entertainment industry today, well adjusted human beings who love the people around them and live life the way it was intended. 
$C: I forward this entire website becomes the Keanu Reeves appreciation society
$C: I always pronounced it "Canoe Reevez" cause it sounds funnier.  But seriously, I love that all of Kanoes' pics are just casual street pics. 
$C: Keanu revvs at a traffic light?
$C: I haven't met him, but my ex played cards with both Keanu and Leaf Phoenix.

Back in the late 80's/early 90's, my ex was into acting. She was cast as an extra in the movie "Parenthood" with Steve Martin and Keanu Reeves. (She can be seen in the opening scene as the woman in the middle of the back seat of the Buick that is pulling out of a parking space as Steve Martin is leaving the baseball game and again during the crash scene at the drag strip.)

It was the drag strip scene where she met both and played cards with them. As my ex told it, it was a very cold night in FL (where the scene was shot). During an extended break between shots, both Keanu and Leaf Phoenix came into the bleachers and sat down to hang out and chat with the extras. They sat down behind her and her husband (at the time, and also an extra) and broke out a deck of cards while everyone waited. Both of them were very cordial, friendly, and down to earth.

I'd love to meet Keanu one day...
$C: Cool
$C: There are a lot of Keanu sightings on Reddit lately.  I wonder what this could mean.
$C: Be excellent
$C: This fucking guy always look like a badass,damn
$C: I like his helmet.
$C: His bike then exploded since it went under 50mph. 
$C: I love this guy
$C: Every post about Keanu Reeves leaves me with a single thought. He just seems so nice!!
$C: Who's Keanu Reeves?
$C: This guy gets around
$C: I guess i will randomly go out now to see Keanu. It will be a first for me in both ways.
$C: I always wonder why I don‚Äôt see all Keanu Reeves stuff in his own subreddit 
$C: Leave the man alone for fucks sake lmao.
$C: Did he have any gray poupon? 
$C: At first glance he appeared to have been holding a battle axe. At 2nd glance he was not. 
$C: He seems like a cool guy
$C: Ok for real, what‚Äôs with all the ‚Äúmeeting Keanu Reeves in public‚Äù pictures? Has he been out a lot more recently?
$C: Damn he fine. Keanu don't krack. 
$C: Why is everyone meeting Keanu Reaves this week!?
$C: It's that really him? I don't know if it's the goggles, but he looks... different.
$C: And in this moment Keanu believes that reddit makes no sense 
$C: As much as I'd try to stay cool, I would 100% lose my mind and cry hysterically on the spot. He's my favorite :3
$C: Whoa
$C: John, you're working again? 
$C: This guy and others like him, must have the patience of a saint.

How on earth can you maintain your sanity when you literally can't get a moment's peace in public?

I'd be a basket case.
$C: Meeting Your Guerrilla public relations agent at a traffic light. 
$C: Dude this guy is literally EVERYWHERE. I‚Äôm starting to think The Matrix was actually a documentary
$C: Wow. Looks like he's just finished blowing up the building behind him. Scene from a Wick movie
$C: *Eh?* I thought he had a Mustang Mach 1.
$C: So much keanu the last days. Seems like we found our new favorite celebrity.

Does he use reddit? 
$C: The immortal Keanu... One of my role models... What a guy...!  
$C: Wow his PR team must be working overtime. A top of reddit post about him for the last few days. He's a good actor, but I also don't like advertiser supported posts.
$C: Keanu Revs is all over the place
$C: Gotta be one of the coolest guys alive
$C: This is actually in my bucket list: meet Keanu Reeves and hug him and thank him for being him. And that's all there is on my list.
$C: Happy Keanu!

It's pretty badass that he owns his own motorcycle company.
$C: Why is the night and the light behind depressing?
$C: He really does seem like one of the coolest, most genuine dudes around!
$C: Ventura and Coldwater!
$C: whoa
$C: I have a feeling he dreads or maybe loves, red lights, because he has to do this at everyone one of them
$C: He certainly seems to be enjoying his celebrity. 
$C: Wait why is everybody meating Keanu Reeves i wanna meet him too
$C: Nice bike
$C: Is there a Keanu sub cos in all honesty that could be what's missing in my life
$C: This is truly a sight to behold
$C: On a Norton nonetheless. What a guy. 
$C: Everyday I like him more and more
$C: Can anybody tell me what kind of motorcycle helmet that is?
$C: The every-day-Keanu-Reeves-pic. There should be a subreddit for those ....
$C: Haha, he makes that bike look small!
$C: HEY VSAUCE MICHAEL HERE! Anyone else see it?
$C: Been seeing quite a few pics of him on social media and reddit lately...he must have a good PR person...
$C: Nice Bike!
$C: Why are there so many Keanu post on the front page lately.  It's been like 2-3 days in a row he's been on the front page.
$C: This guy is everywhere
$C: Sweet ride üèç
$C: Keanu is there for you \m/
$C: Keanu is the most blessing thing of 2018
$C: Coldwater Canyon and Ventura Blvd., correct?
$C: I love my birthday twin <3
$C: He woke up one morning and decided to take that bike across Europe 
$C: My first big bike was a 75 Norton 850 Commando.  Loved that bike.  Keanu riding a Snortin‚Äô Norton just raises him up even more in my book.  God that bike had a good sound.  I broke a chain dropping the clutch on that bad boy one time.  So much torque.
$C: That Norton Commando tho...
$C: Reeves 2020
$C: WICK! * GUNFIGHT AND MOTORCYCLE CHASE BREAKS OUT *
$C: He's just a man-about-town these days. He's been in so many photos on here lately. I've always liked him, he seems like such a fun guy, but maybe thats just my memory of 80's and 90's movies.  
$C: Saw him one once on Mother‚Äôs Day in his Porsche. He said hi and raced off to the PV hills. Cool dude. 
$C: dude does everything, My jaw dropped when he was doing this firearm pratice course, he is really good.

[head shot, head shot, probably dick shot, press start, switch guns....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MIc9Z50Uv4)
$C: And then he leaves to his home where he rolls up his Keanu Sleeves
$C: What the hell, he's everywhere
$C: Tell him to stop being a squid and wear some damn gear!! üòÇ
$C: I really hope he's not as sad in real life, as the memes make him out to be. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Reddit LOVES Keanu
$C: He seems to be normal guy
$C: What city is this ffs?
$C: Why is Keanu Reeves hitting the front page almost every day? Is this a PR campaign or is he back on center stage...? 
$C: Does Keanu Reeves own shares of Reddit? Dude is all over this site!  Not that I'm complaining.
$C: Keanu Reeves: so hot right now 
$C: Are these all recent pictures of him hitting the front page? I want to believe they are. 
$C: Fucking love this man. Genuinely nice human being.
$C: That man rides some classy motorcycles.
$C: where does reddit keep finding this guy??! pls help me find him guys!
$C: The cult of Keanu is starting to get creepy 
$C: I feel like they're are many of him roaming around the world 
$C: Is it just me, or is he appearing in from of a lot of people recently? He's sure kean on making people happy
$C: Keanu is the man, bruh.
$C: Pretty bike. I love standards. 
$C: Can someone make a Keanu sub? Every day there's a pic of him. I get it. He has a normal life and he touched your life essence.
$C: Keanu Reeves Shredding

https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/7pg4ni/keanu_reeves_shredding/?st=JC9U0WLC&sh=8b5bd314

$C: I fucking love Keanu Reeves
$C: Wow, Keanu on a Norton. I didn't expect that or see that coming. Such a lovely make of bike.

Got a Commando, 850 I think, in pieces in the garage, really need to put it together. 
$C: This happens in LA more often than you think. Greeted him at the Venice Blvd/Centinela Ave intersection and he was on the exact same bike.
$C: HE'S TOUCHING THE BIKE
$C: This is so bad ass.
$C: I really respect Keanu Reeves both as an actor and as a human. If I ever run into him out in the real world, I'm going to give him a single respectful nod to let him know I think he is awesome, then look away and leave him the fuck alone unless he comes over and starts taking to me.


I'll leave my phone in my pocket.
$C: I would be like, ‚ÄúOh shit, John Wick is here to kill me!‚Äù
$C: That's my dream bike. I will have one soon. He is the Dave Grohl of acting. 
$C: Why are there always pics of this guy in the most random public places? Does he just enjoy being out in public with ordinary people?
$C: Thats more emotion then he had in all of speed
$C: Keanu is slowly working his way up through the apprenticeship that Bill Murray setup for him.  One day, the torch will pass, and people will talk about the time Keanu Reeves came to their house, dressed as Neo, for halloween.

Other than trick or treat, all he says is that no one will believe you.
$C: Does he know how reddit he is?
$C: Man, he's a good guy. 
$C: "Hey John, you working again?"

"Mmmaaayyybbbee"
$C: Apparently Keanu Reeves is fucking everywhere 
$C: The most average celebrity you‚Äôll meet. In a good way.
$C: Why is this man EVERYWHERE
$C: That man is everywhere. 
$C: "Hey you're Keanu Reeves"

"Yeah, yeah I am"
$C: If he had a bat with barbed wire around it, I'd think he was Negan before Keanu.
$C: Or is it Adam Driver?

$C: Why is keanu reddits idol all of the sudden? Im not trying to be mean but i dont get it
$C: I see this guy everywhere on this sub. Who is he?
$C: For fuck's sake people leave the man alone! The dude can't eat a sandwich without having to smile at someone's phone lately.
$C: Man, Keanu Reeves has been dominating Reddit 
$C: Sure that isn't Ed Norton? The giveaway is his name on the bike!
$C: I feel like everyone on reddit except me has met Keanu Reeves 
$C: He is so incredibly humble for what he does and down to earth. 
He is a little nuts with his own safety as he is know for just walking around out in public or taking mass transit in major cities , but seriously when your that chill and decent who the hell would want to hurt you anyway 
$C: Is Keanu Reeves a meme right now or something?

I feel like he's been on the frontpage like three times in the last two weeks
$C: Is there a smile there?  No more sad Keanu? Is that like I'm going to rip off your head Keanu look? AI/ML get to work, what are we looking at exactly?

Holy Mother of God!  :-)
$C: keanu reeves after he left the airport?
$C: Keanu Revved 
$C: Oh man, that is a sweet ride. Never heard of the make but now I want one.
$C: He is the one.
$C: This man is a god send
$C: It's to the point where I feel like that I'm the only person here who hasn't ran into Keanu Reeves or Bill Murray. 
$C: I wonder if he knows that 99.99% of Reddit thinks of him as just a good dude we would sit with in a dive bar, conversing about normal stuff over a few beers? Sure he's super famous, but he wouldn't be out of place at all hanging out with any normal group of friends in America.
$C: I can't imagine what that men's life must be like. Constantly meeting people everywhere that are probably super excited to meet him. Meanwhile he plays it so cool every single time. I've never heard a bad story about meeting him, meaning either he's never had a bad day (imposible) or he's just so good at keeping himself in check to make sure the fans have a good experience.
$C: Omg thats John Wick
$C: Okay, that's pretty cool.
$C: KR is such a badass! An awesome person from the looks of things! Keep it my man!!!
$C: So many random pics of Keanu keep showing up that I wonder if maybe China made a bunch of Clone Keanu‚Äôs and set them forth on to the world.
$C: What street in Los Angeles?
$C: Hey does anyone know that r/hmm with all of the Ed Sheerans as grass? Can someone with more talent than me do that here but turn the road into really tiny Keanu heads? I would be forever grateful. 
$C: Keanu makes that Norton commando 750 look small ...
$C: I don't go a full 24 hours without seeing his face on Reddit. 
$C: Ventura and cold water cyn? 
$C: Can someone please explain to me why I've seen so many pics and vids of him in the past week? Am i missing something?
$C: A 100% relevant and awesome song about this man: [Shortstraw - Keanu Reeves](https://youtu.be/RxyytU-ltmY)
$C: I hope everyone took the red pill! 
$C: He makes me gay 
$C: I'm loving all these recent posts of Keanu. 
$C: Is that Ventura and Cold Water? I used to work near by.
$C: Feels like he's everywhere right now...


.....Agent Smith? 0_0

$C: He seems like such a nice guy! I'd love to cross paths with him and give him a wave and a smile :)
$C: Put this man in a Marvel or DC film for Neo sake
$C: Man I'd love an electric version of that bike. 
$C: Seeing a lot more of keanu already this year. Seems like he's coming out of his shell a bit
$C: Keanu bless.
$C: Love that he rides a 750 Commando.
$C: Do you really think Keanu Reeves wants to be photographed while he's out minding his own business? He looks caught off guard! This celebrity worship needs to stop.


 I imagine some celebrities view people who raise their phone and take an unsolicited picture as pitiful and lacking something of substance in their lives. Like they can't wait to go home and tell everyone who they saw,  and get imaginary points on the internet.

Anybody else feel this way? Anybody willing to take a good hard look at themselves and their behavior?

If you feel compelled to downvote, at least reply and tell me what the underlying motivation for taking an unsolicited picture of a celebrity is.
$C: I didnt know keanu could be that funny
$C: thank god for keanu reeves 
$C: Woah..A most excellent encounter!!
$C: I'm wondering if his manager makes him have a rider on his motorcycle insurance policy that covers injuries to his face. 

Not judging him, I also ride with open face helmets. But my job doesn't depend on my face **not** looking like Supreme Leader Snoke's were I to get in a bad accident. 

That said, maybe he crashes and then gets cast in the future new-trilogy prequel featuring the story of the rise of Snoke. 

That also said, don't crash, Keanu. Party on, dude.
$C: Love all these Keanu Reeves in the wild photos 
$C: He's almost smiling 
$C: Keanu Reeves rides a Norton Commando. This just made my life.
$C: TIL Keanu and I have the same bike.
$C: Whoa 
$C: Everyone is meeting Keanu in 2018 and I'm here looking at my dog. 
$C: I really hope that man is happy, I believe he deserves it.
If I saw him on the street I would offer to buy him coffee or something.
$C: He is such an inspirational human being.
$C: thats a sweet norton. Man has taste.
$C: Back in the 90's I met him in an elevator in Chicago... Very cool guy.
$C: I wish he never ages, so he can be with us forever.
$C: He needs his own subreddit. 
$C: When the light turns green, Keanu Leaves.
$C: Keanu pops up when you least expect him
$C: I feel like he knows he's Reddits dad
$C: Why do I see Keanu everyday on the front page lol
$C: Is this Ventura and Coldwater?
$C: Guy could afford to fly around town in a space ship. Rad mother fucker that he is, he putts around town on a classic Norton with a dorky helmet and crappy clothes. 
I really am impressed by that man.  Nothing has gone to his head. What an admirable human. 
$C: Guys, you shouldn't take pictures of keanu in the wild. You're not supposed to disturb someone as nice as him in its natural habitat. 
$C: Awesome guy!
$C: Woah 
$C: This man is the best
$C: Just when I thought he couldn't get any cooler.
$C: Everyone gets +2 wisdom and constitution as long as they stay within his buff range. 
$C: As an immortal, Keanu needn't worry about the usual dangers associated with motorcycles. It's no wonder he rides one.
$C: Hey is that Ventura and Coldwater Canyon in Studio City?
$C: I‚Äôve read nothing but positive comments about him. A true gentleman.
$C: " Do you think thats a traffic light you're sitting at, do you?"
$C: It doesn't get much cooler than a Snortin' Norton. 
$C: Guys... This wins the internet. Thank you all.
$C: I have no idea what it must feel like to be constantly bothered by photos and autographs as a celebrity. I have one autograph from Grant Achatz. The only reason why I have it is because he plated our dessert at Alin√©a personally and I had brought an old Food and Wine magazine featuring him in it, (this was 2010), and I got lucky. I would never bother a celebrity out in public, and I don't understand the people that do. That being said, Keanu is awesome. 
$C: A Norton! Very cool bikes
$C: No waaaay!! üé∏ Riff
$C: This I feel confirms that Reddit is in fact in love with the Reeves.




$C: The bike looks tiny under him but he's 6"1' which isn't especially tall in the US.
$C: There seems to be an influx of Kea New. I aint complaining.
$C: Why is Reddit in love with Keanu?
$C: If I won the chance to have a beer with celeb he'd be number one .
$C: The guy who is everywhere, but we hardly know him. There seems to be such depth to his persona. The most interesting Hollywood celebrity. 
$C: By his comment history, OP must be Keanu‚Äôs best friend or something. 
$C: Noice .
$C: All these people catching photos of Keanu like they are pokemon trainers and he is a pidgey. Yeah nice picture like we have seen that in the wild before! 
$C: Why can‚Äôt more celebs be like Keanu. He‚Äôs the fucking coolest. I see so many post of him on reddit and every picture he stops and takes the time to smile for the camera. He‚Äôs so chill 
$C: Third photo of Keanu on the front page in the last week. I'm not complaining.

 r/hailkeanu
$C: i wouldn't have even recognized him

$C: We need r/kasualkeanu
$C: Netflix isn‚Äôt paying well I see. That last movie about him being scammed into Sex by underage girls was hilarious though. Idk if it was meant to be funny though lmao!
$C: God, he is so fucking *hot*.



(Relax, I‚Äôm a woman)
$C: What's with all this Keanu postings?
$C: This is the best part of my week.
$C: KEANU FOR PREZ! #NEO2020
$C: Keanu Reeves in 2020... :)
$C: Cause they stole his car
$C:  Cold water and Ventura?
$C: [removed]
$C: can‚Äôt y‚Äôall leave the man alone just once
$C: I‚Äôm really digging this new 2018 ‚Äúwhere is Keanu‚Äù trend! 
$C: Tell Keanu to ATTGATT his ass up before he hits an oil slick and loses half his face. Dude's too much of a treasure to ride without full protection.
$C: I like how he isn't riding one of those bikes that his company made
$C: Going by his interviews and this picture - keanu is frigging amazing 
$C: Love this dude.
$C: Seems like a lot of people on Reddit have met Keanu Reeves.
$C: Can someone explain Reddit‚Äôs obsession with Keanu Reeves? Seems like a decent dude, sure, but I just don‚Äôt understand why he hits the front page pretty much every day
$C: Keanu continues to bless Reddit with his awesomeness.
$C: He‚Äôs one cool dude. Never acts like a celebrity. He also owns a sick custom-made motorcycle company.
$C: Day#6 for Keanu Reeves
$C: Is this in studio city? This so much looks like the Ralph's across from sportsman's lodge on coldwater canyon
$C: Keanu is so cool.  
$C: What‚Äôs with the sudden increase in Keanu Reeves appearances, not that I‚Äôm complaining.
$C: How to get karma on reddit 

1.) Post picture of Keanu Reeves doing something cool
2.) ???
3.) Profit
$C: loving seeing all these random keanu reeves sightings.  i'm hoping he shows up in my chai latte cup this morning lmao
$C: Hmmm, And I thought he was just a bunch of 0's and 1's. Thats cool!

$C: Badass 
$C: Keanu for president!   Nice guy does not grab pu&&y everyday hero.  Movie hero.  

What could be wrong?
$C: Keanu is one of the most down-to-Earth actors that are out there, it truly amazes me that he's willing to take pics and selfies with people who ask.
$C: Very nice taste in motorbikes
$C: Sploosh. 
$C: When exactly did Keanu Reeves become a feature of internet folklore?
$C: Keanu is the man
$C: This guy is every where
$C: Oh man, I think I know right where this is. Is this on Ventura and Coldwater Canyon?
$C: Keanu so hot right now
$C: Yep!! 
I am desperately waiting for you.
Love you!!
$C: Why are all of OPs posts about Keanu Reeves?
$C: My jealousy is off the scales.
$C: One of the best bikes in the world. This, the triumph Bonnie, the Honda‚Äôs, and other of these upright bikes are the most fun to drive. 
$C: The best human ever.
$C: It‚Äôs too much now, he‚Äôs so goddamn terrific.
$C: When he's riding is bike around slower moving traffic, is he Keanu Weaves?
$C: Well, he *was* sitting.

$C: Did you ask him if he was still working?
$C: Would wouldn‚Äôt that kick a little ass
$C: Santa Monica Blvd?
$C: Where isn't this man?!? Blessings, Keanu!
$C: Keanu for pres 2020
$C: Damn, someone who relies on their face for their livelihood so much ought to be in a full-face.
$C: Too lazy to look, does Keanu have his own subreddit?

Cuz he should.
$C: Is Keanu the new Bill Murray?
$C: For about 15 years I‚Äôve had an agreement with a good friend of mine; if i‚Äôm able to get a pic of Keanu and I playing air guitar (I must be in my Wyld Stallyns t-shirt) then I get a million bucks. That shirt has long since shrunk but I still hold out hope!
$C: Was there a glitch in the matrix and Neo is somehow stuck on reddit servers?

Edit::
That Norton bike is nasty.
$C: Working Boots
Combat Pants (Blue)
Long Sleeve Shirt (Black)
Motorcycle Helmet (lvl.1)
Welcome to the Battleground
$C: If this dude knew how many creepy weirdos on reddit said this type of insane shit abt him....
$C: 750 Commando. Nice choice. 
$C: Reddit loves Keanu Reeves, then again, who doesn‚Äôt. 
$C: "Ok, so you have got some skills."
$C: He seems like an amazing guy, he used to be the butt of many jokes way back when, I don‚Äôt see why...great man, actor, human being!
$C: I will never ever even be a fraction of how cool and amazing he is.
$C: Gawd he's so hawt
$C: Is there a Reeves movie coming out? He's been in the front page 3 times in the past week! 
$C: whoa.
$C: i think this man is too valuable to be riding a motorcycle
$C: Coldwater Canyon and Ventura?
$C: Doesn't look like him
$C: That blue street sign with white writing and border is the city of LA but I can't make out what street it is
$C: Wow this guy is really IN the matrix, He's fucking everywhere, seen it like 5 times in a week in reddit.
$C: Is that the Ralphs on Ventura and Coldwater Canyon?
$C: Wish he would wear a full face Snell rated helmet at least... 
$C: You're just asking to get throat punched. 
$C: Wtf where isn‚Äôt this dude!
$C: Coldwater and Ventura in Studio City!


$C: Does he know he has a following on reddit?
$C: Reddit makes me feel like it‚Äôs only a matter of time until I bump into Keanu Reeves myself one day.
$C: Those boots are fire
$C: this guy is so cool. i wish i was his friend
$C: He rides a Norton? Did not know that.
$C: haha nicee
$C: Was this taken in Chatsworth California?
$C: He‚Äôs the best human 
$C: Keanu Reeves 2020
$C: Why is Keanu so popular on Reddit? I mean aside from just seeming like a really cool person. Is there some back story I don't know? 
$C: ok so how does one say Keanu? tired of saying  "canoe"....thank you. In advance, Sorry Mr. Reeves.
$C: Keanu is the Real people‚Äôs champion üòé
$C: how does this guy keep popping up on reddit and coming across as such a freaking nice guy.

Guess I wont assume anything and ill just go with .. he is one cool and nice dude.
$C: So, I get 2018 is Keanu Reeve's year? I love it.
$C: Interesting he isn't driving one his own motorcycles -

$C: +93k upvotes? What am I missing? I don't think I understand the Reddit.... 
$C: Nice Norton! Love that bike. 
$C: He‚Äôs riding a kick ass bike! My old man had a 750 Norton!
$C: He'll find you when the time is right


$C: Kinda looks like Vsauce 
$C: how could anyone recognize him like that? 
$C: So awesome, I read he's a down to earth guy. Must be a great experience to meet him around.
$C: Is it me or does he look oversized on this bike, like he's a real man on a kid's bike?
$C: [What Keanu sees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2FMSnl8qOY)
$C: Umm, running into the same person once or twice because you frequent the same bar or gym is one thing. "Randomly running into" a celebrity and filming him on multiple occasions, then posting to Reddit is something else.

Are you the one who took the video and other candid shots? 
$C: My worst imagination is coming true Keanu is everywhere. 
$C: Why does Reddit have a hard on for Keanu all the sudden?
$C: I thought Keanu lived in Manhattan and donated most of his money towards a cancer foundation because of hi sister?

I may be wrong about some of what I said if I am please correct me.
$C: Honestly thought this was Markiplier until I read the title
$C: This man is a legend. I aspire to be like him one day. 
$C: Is he taking over bodies like an agent? I see him everywhere!
$C: He seems like such a cool down to earth guy IRL

Also, love that bike! 
$C: That Norton has to be pretty special .
$C: I wonder if he likes pot
$C: He does have great taste on motorcycles
$C: I nominate Keanu Reeves as the face of Reddit, 2018!
$C: Goddamn that's a beautiful bike.
$C: A Norton. Good man. 
$C: Thought it was Michael from Vsauce
$C: Woah
$C: That's Coldwater and Ventura.
$C: Coldwater Canyon and Ventura blvd? 
$C: Keanu with genuine cooperation and setting the example for motorbike helmet sagety. Double whammy. God damn it, so wholesome 
$C: What‚Äôs with all the random Keanu sightings lately ? 

Edit: iPhone thumbs.
$C: He's the coolest. Am I right?
$C: but were you riding too?
$C: Why would you care? Lol
$C: The similarities are pretty good. Thought it was really him for a minute.
$C: So all I need to do to get 100k upvotes is to take a picture of a celebrity on a motorcycle?
I wonder if anyone would catch on if I just took old pics of famous people from Google or something and put the caption "look who I ran into today"  
$C: WILD STALLIONS! 
$C: *Whoa...*
$C: Hey, Hey, Hey , "You got any of that-weed?"
$C: Is he becoming the new Bill Murray? 
$C: Can anyone explain the Keanu Reeves obsession in Reddit right now? I'm a bit lost.

$C: I feel as if Keanu is reaching Bill Murray status, whereas he is instant loved by everyone he comes across. He's earned it too, the man's saint-like.
$C: Man, Keanu reeves is probably the coolest dude ever.
$C: Keanu Reeves is like a best friend that you never met!
$C: He was on the way to Michaels to meet his friend Dave.
$C: The upvotes on this post are going up like the price of bitcoin.
$C: very cute
$C: What city was this in? LA?
$C: What movie does this guy have coming out soon? It‚Äôs been nothing but Keanu Reeves on the front page for a week.
$C: Norton Commando, that's pretty cool! 

I like Keanu Reeves, because he's almost never in the celebrity media, yet he's a really good actor. He's perfect for the Matrix. Sorry Keanu, apart from that I've only ever seen Speed! Still though, the Matrix trilogy is one of my favorites, so.
$C: Why is this guy such a meme on reddit? I see posts about him all of the time.
$C: Does he have any idea how much we love him here at Reddit?
$C: You've been down that road Neo. You know where it leads.
$C: This guy is killing it, absolute fan favorite of reddit.

Edit: too many plurals
$C: That a very liberal use of the word 'meeting'.
$C: Is there a subreddit for Keanu spottings?
$C: This guy likes motorcycles? now I respect him even more.
$C: Keanu Revves
$C: He is truly living life to the fullest.
$C: He should really be wearing a full face helmet. 
All the gear all the time. 
$C: Why can't I meet anyone cool or influential? 
$C: Is it just me or does he look high af
$C: Keanu Reeves should just have his own sub reddit of him doing Keanu shit
$C: How awesomely coolüôÇ
$C: He still has that bike. Classic.
$C: Norton 750 - awesome!
$C: My dad has that bike too, all the parts are in boxes in his garage though. It‚Äôs been an ongoing project to rebuild since before I was born...I‚Äôm 36.
$C: Thanks no Keanu Reeves....that‚Äôs tha FU-KING BOOGEYMAN
$C: [Ventura Blvd. & Coldwater Canyon Ave.](https://www.google.com/maps/@34.14511,-118.4136153,3a,75y,193.22h,90.33t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sC5p5RmpZdhVjzKcs_Kf4Qg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656)
$C: Why isn't there a sub for Keanu in public?
$C: Superb!
$C: Maybe we're all really in the Matrix and he's able to login where he needs to be in order to take cool pictures or be awesome to people. 
$C: A Norton!  That man has taste!
$C: haha awesome
$C: He has good taste in classic bikes. Cool dude. Always seems to be riding from all the posts I see of him on a bike or holding his helmet somewhere else. 
$C: OMG! I fainted.
$C: Another reason to love Keanu :-)
$C: Hes everywhere!!
$C: Geezer 
$C: That‚Äôs Ventura Blvd in Studio City!!! 
$C: Keanu seems like he genuinely loves being recognized. Seems like an all around wholesome guy. 
$C: He actually looks happy in this one. Probably because he could speed off immediately after.
$C: he looks like markiplier 
$C: I wonder if KR uses Reddit, upvotes the post, and is one of the comments that gets buried away :( "Hey guys that's me!"
$C: I like this guy.  He seems so approachable and inviting. 
$C: This guy's life must be very different from what it was a few years ago, now that pretty much everyone in the world's figured out he's a damned decent dude.

He's enjoying a *Keanussaince*!

(I'll see myself out.)
$C: Is it just me, or does he always seem lost?
$C: That‚Äôs John wick....
$C: HE'S SMILEING 
$C: Mr.Wick was hunting
$C: Love Nortons!  He has class and style. Supposedly a nice guy also.
$C: ITT, we learn that a lot of people don't know how to rhyme. 
$C: Is this on coldwater canyon?
$C: Keanu is becoming like some omnipresent creature of goodness. He's everywhere just being a good guy.
$C: Papa Keanu is reddits new Terry Crews
$C: Did Keanu Reeves take some kind of master class in appearing affable in photos? When you looked at this photo, didn't you think "what a nice man"? How does he do that? He's just sitting on a bike at traffic lights.
$C: Hey Vsauce, Micheal here
$C: Who is that? And why does anyone care more than the next person?
$C: I wouldn‚Äôt recognize him if I saw him somewhere, I guess I don‚Äôt idolize celebrities as we don‚Äôt really know them.
$C: I swear this guy is everywhere. I'm convinced there are multiple Keanus.
$C: How is everyone meeting this vampire? 
$C: Nice to see him practicing ATGATT.

Apparently he's one of those celebs who have a great reputation for acting "normal" and is pretty cool around regular people.

I should probably re-watch "Devil's Advocate" cause I wouldn't mind if that Mailbox Money fed his Norton habit.


$C: Cool
$C: That‚Äôs some matrix shit 
$C: Keanu Bless
$C: He seems like such a chill guy. From his interviews, he sounds like he has a strange sense of humor lol.
$C: Keanu is one of the coolest motorcycling celebs there is 
$C: Keanu and the Rock should do a movie together, they seem to be two of the nicest guys on Hollywood.
$C: This guy's everywhere
$C: he's clearly the most loved human being on planet earth
$C: Can we make Keanu Reeves the face of reddit
$C: This guy is just too cool.
$C: How is this man so cool?!
$C: Keanu Reeves will always be a cool fucking guy. I like how he tried his best to pose and smile for the picture.
$C: Praise him.
$C: He‚Äôs riding a Norton Commando 750. That was my dad‚Äôs bike and he loved it. Always having starter issues though. You have to step down on a kick lever to start it up. 
$C: He is so cute, lol
$C: The Norton 700 Commando is one of the coolest bikes to ride ever.  Even without Keanu sportin' one.  Amazing power for late 60's/early 70's 4-stroke tech, and they actually handled very well relative to what else was available at the time.  Definitely an underappreciated bike at the time.
$C: Dude just oozes COOL on a Kung Fu master level....see what I did there
$C: We pretty much track his movements through sightings of him on Reddit, no?
$C: Maybe he split himself into may Neos  like the agent  did in  the Matrix
$C: This cycle is one bitch to turn 	over. But you probably don't know about motorcycles. 
$C: Why are we now obsessed with Keanu
Did I miss something 
$C: Why is everyone meeting Keanu recently?
$C: This guy is a treasure I love him
$C: Thought it was Lester Freeman
$C: Because of all of these Keanu pics in here recently, last night I had a dream that I met him. Thanks. :)

Edit: I should clarify...didn‚Äôt meet him, SAW him (in a NY bookstore) but didn‚Äôt say anything because I didn‚Äôt want to bother him. 
$C: I know where that is! Ventura Blvd. and Laurel Canyon. 
$C: I feel like I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of random Keanu Reeves run-ins lately 
$C: I like the fact that he's in this place in the universe where he honestly does what he wants. He rides the bike he wants to ride, not one that's necessarily "cool" like a chopper or crotch rocket. He looks like he's having a great time enjoying his ride. He probably has a stable of bikes and that day he chose the classic bike with the classic helmet and goggles to go along with it. 

Edit: he's wearing safety glasses not goggle, still looks like a great time.
$C: His dad is a real deadbeat piece of shit. Why Keanu turned out so good I have no idea.

http://archives.starbulletin.com/2001/04/22/features/story1.html
$C: Maaaaaan, I wanna randomly meet Keanu somewhere. He seems cool and up for a bit of fun with fans
$C: My dad has that exact bike. Beautiful and when it ran, it was the greatest bike of all time....when it ran.....
$C: We must protect Keanu Reeves at all costs.
$C: Should have made the South Park Harley noise at him. Keanu is looking fine in all these photos pop'n up. Meow.

https://youtu.be/RzmUob02pQk
$C: I don't understand why people don't think they need full face helmets. [You have twice as high chance of head injury or disfigurement with half-helmet.] (https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/40/3/794/746475) And a man as handsome as that guy, I don't get why he doesn't want to protect his face. I ride with full safety gear just because I've been down before, and I know how it is. 
$C: I had a similar experience with Lawrence Fishburn once. Nice shot!
$C: Keanu is cool, but omg that old Norton is a dream. 
$C: It‚Äôs like a game of Where‚Äôs Waldo: Keanu Edition, and I love it.
$C: I guess 1969 Ford Mustang is not the sh*t anymore
$C: Is that cold water canyon and Ventura?
$C: I WANNA MEET KEANU
$C: Your going to jinx this guy with all the Reddit publicity and he's going to have some crazy accident. Don't say I didn't warn you!
$C: Jesus this guy is everywhere 
$C: He has appeared in two pictures within this one week! Is he everywhere
$C: That's a '75 Norton commando, nice taste in bikes. 
$C: Coolest dude ever!
$C: I like that he's wearing a helmet, someone of his influence following safety is good.
$C: Is there a reason I'm seeing Keanu Reeves on r/all a lot recently?
$C: Looks like the corner of Coldwater canyon and Ventura Blvd. looking south?
$C: Bill, strange things are afoot at the Circle K!
$C: are you sure that isn't markiplier
$C: I went round the Norton factory last summer. The aluminium tank is an option that's made out of 6 separate pieces of aluminium that are welded together with the same grade aluminium and then ground, polished etc until it looks like it's one marvelous piece of engineering. 

Wanna guess how much the shiny task costs?
$C: I wonder if he knows how popular he is on reddit 
$C: Reddit fuckin loves Keanu. Not a negative, just an observation. 
$C: Was it truly him,

The man?

The myth?

The legend?
$C: Thanks kind stranger. I'll think about it. 
$C: A Norton Come-and-Go no less... seriously cool! 
$C: That's gotta be right at Coldwater Canyon and Ventura Blvd. in Sherman Oaks. God I miss Los Angeles, live in the northeast now. 
$C: Thats a pretty bike
$C: You dont meet fucking Keanu Reeves everyday 
$C: Annnd he rides a Norton Commando. Just when I thought I couldn't fanboy over Keanu any more.
$C: And here we find the graceful Keanu Reeves upon his trusty two wheel metal steed. Red turns green and we watch as Keanu leaves. What an amazing sight to behold. A sighting of the majestic creature. Truly a wonder.
$C: Must en awesome
$C: Wait -- he went slower than 55?!
$C: Is Keanu Reeves secret Mr. Smith and we are in the Matrix and he‚Äôs secretly everywhere?
$C: Why can't I run into Keaunu, he seems really down to earth.
$C: Keanu Reeves is taking over the internet, I see a post about him everyday now!
$C: Can you please clean your phone lens? Its very smudgy.
$C: All these recent Keanu posts seems like reddit way of playing where waldo
$C: are we supposed to know this is photoshopped?  This looks like an awful shop job....but no one is saying this in the comments so I r confused?
$C: Well, Chuck Norris is getting tired.....
$C: That‚Äôs a bucket list ride for me
$C: Why is Keanu Reeves all over reddit everyday 
$C: Reddit is slowly becoming one giant homage to Keanu Reaves, this is only the beginning - Mark my words soon reddit will be overcome with Keanu posts.. don't worry about the vase.
$C: There is a glitch in the Matrix
$C: This comment thread is pure gold
$C: Keanu has been all over this month
$C: I feel like posting a picture of Keanu Reeves on Reddit is just cheating now
$C: All hail the King of Reddit!
$C: Me too
$C: Keanu Reeves is like the "Where's Waldo?" of 2018.
$C: This guy is like the crowned prince of reddit already. And I am okay with that. 
$C: My dream
$C: I want to ride with this guy.  Seems like he's everywhere.  
$C: My brain would not have time to get through the checklist of:

* Is that...?  
* No, it's just someone who looks like him.  
* A LOT like him.  
* Well, i guess maybe it is.  
* HEY!!!! It really is him.  This is great!   
* Let me get my ph---

before HHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNKKKKKKKKKKK!
$C: I wonder if you are in the Matrix? And this picture doesn't exist?
$C: 750 Commando, I can remember when they were rated as the fastest production motorcycle in the world.

Things have changed a lot since then.
$C: Can a person get cooler and cooler as every minute passes? At some point are there diminishing returns? Not with this guy.
$C: that's vsauce mik√†l
$C: Life goals 
$C: Keanu: "Sup.... I am THE ONE"
$C: lol hes like everywhere now
$C: Hey! Vsauce Michael here.
$C: Isn't that the V sauce guy?
$C: is that coldwater and ventura?
$C: It seems like I'm the only one who did NOT meet him.
$C: I‚Äôm surprised he never gave you his bike
$C: A buddy of mine lives in Malibu a few houses down from his house, he‚Äôs always around and a really nice guy from what I‚Äôve heard.
$C: It's just hockey, not ice hockey. Thanks


-Canada
$C: I hope I never meet Keanu. I screamed when I saw this. Just a blood curdling scream. I'm a fairly big dude so it would be extra weird in person. I'm not even gay, I just love him because all of my favorite stars from childhood ended up being total douche bags except Keanu, Harrison Ford, and Tom Hanks.
$C: Jersey? Doesn't he live in NYC I'm guessing this is Jersey because it looks a bit like it and looks nothing like any part of NY
$C: his last name is Reeves? OMFG
$C: On a Norton Commando no less!
$C: upvoting this thread mostly because of "Keanu Leaves" thread
$C: I bet that motorcycle sounded like, **Whoa**whoawhoawhoawhoawhoawhoawhoa
$C: he seems to be a nice guy

$C: Nice shiny bike
$C: The most incredible man alive
$C: Something must be afoot! So many Keanu sightings and it‚Äôs only 11 days into 2018.
$C: /u/keanureeves I named my cat after you around a decade ago. Key and Peele never responded to my letter about them stealing my cat's name!
$C: this motherfucker is all over the place
$C: Even as a hetro I want to do this guy
$C: I‚Äôm not sure what I love more, Keanu or the bike!
$C: God speed you, black emperor!
$C: I've seen that bike before. Psych? 
$C: must be asking for da wae

$C: Beautiful bike!!! Fits well with the kind of bike he's building!
$C: cool
$C: Really weird, was watching John Wick 2 and this is what I first see when opening Reddit
$C: Damn he's cool.
$C: Okay, I need to have a random Keanu encounter now or I'll never feel accomplished with my life.
$C: Keanu is a karma bitch 
$C: I have this dumb dream of one day running into Keanu and telling him to have a great day. :)
$C: I hope he burned out at the green light
$C: NEO
$C: WHOA...
$C: #randomkeanu
$C: The new Bill Murray fan experience. 
$C: This is just awesome 
$C: That is his twin brother. Ean.
$C: John Wick
$C: Love him <3
$C: Love him!
$C: That man never slows down
$C: ***please don't let Keanu have touched or spoken with anyone inappropriately in the last 30 years***
$C: Not his Anarch bike though
$C: This officially this year's first new wave on the internet.
$C: That's a 5-star man, right there. 
$C: He‚Äôs moving into a tie with Tom Hanks as my favorite actor.
$C: ‚Äú50! Stay above 50!‚Äù
$C: Damn, is it Keanu week?
$C: Ah, yes. Reddit‚Äôs God. 
$C: This guy gets around!
$C: Keanu just seems like a really cool genuine kind of guy.
$C: 2018 is the year of Keanu
$C: Or: "How I Lost My Girlfriend". 
$C: And just like that. Nortonmotorcycles.com got 130k new visitors....
$C: Is there a dedicated sub for Keanu? There needs to be one if there isn‚Äôt. 
$C: -Alternate Universe-
‚ÄúKeanu Reeves can get 135k upvotes, how much for this half naked lady?‚Äù
$C: Are you stalking him??
$C: 2018: Year of the Keanu
$C: I would have rather seen him on his own motorcycle though :( 
$C: This is exactly the bike I expected him to ride when I saw that other post of him in the store with his helmet
$C: Remember the good old days when NK news used to take up the top of Reddit?

Well now Keanu Reeves is the NK of things on Reddit.
$C: Am I the only one who hasn't met Keanu Reeves?
$C: Oh Keanu, Keanu, Keanu....I think I love you.
$C: I recognize that intersection!
$C: Be noted: You are about to enter the Matrix ...
$C: That the corner of Coldwater Canyon and Ventura Blvd?
$C: [deleted]
$C: Custom bikes built by the one and onlyüôå
$C: That's awesome, but what's with all these Keanu posts lately? Did something happen to make him go viral?
$C: Woah....
$C: Dont take his car and kill his dog
$C: Am I the only one confused about how everyone is so sure that's actually him? Couldn't it be a lookalike? Tbh I'm terrible at faces so I really don't know
$C: Keanu Reeves. Patrick Stewart. Net neutrality. Reddit seems to only be a repository for marketing campaigns nowadays.
$C: That's an awesome bike!  
$C: Would‚Äôve sworn he preferred a ‚Äò69 mustang ü§î
$C: "I'm here to tell. You that the spoon doesn't  exist"
$C: damn, that's a nice bike. 
$C: Do you guys think he ever feels like he is trapped in the matrix? 
$C: Gosh, he‚Äôs so awesome and cute
$C: Norton.... HNNNNNNNNNNNG
$C: God he‚Äôs everywhere! 
$C: Hey that‚Äôs in Studio City! Corner on Coldwater and Ventura heading westbound.
$C: Hahaha that's the coolest picture.
$C: he looks weird with the crooked helmet and glasses

$C: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll kill them all‚Äù-Mr Wick
$C: This man is everywhere
$C: Ew, he can afford infinitely better bikes. That thing is a rolling headache. 
$C: What a swell guy, super talented, informed, and a good person. He knows about the Satanists in our Goverment, and Hollywood too.  Thanks for the great movies over the years!!!
$C: Keanu Reeves just seems like such a cool guy. I really hope he hasn't ever diddled anyone.
$C: Wait, I saw that movie. I'm pretty sure somewhere behind him was a Chain Reaction explosion that he was trying to escape.
$C: KeanuSightings
$C: How did he not dodge you?
$C: What‚Äôs that? That‚Äôs the sound of panties dropping around the world 
$C: Is it too much to just say "Hey I'm a big fan!" smile, and take a mental picture?

I mean, now instead of a memory of meeting Keanu at a light, there is a memory of taking a picture... and you annoyed him.
$C: My uncle looks just like Keanu, wish he was Keanu.  Having his wife die would have been better than his divorce and if he was Keanu he'd still have his millions.
$C: This guy is everywhere. Maybe ill see him next. . .
$C: Is he everywhere or is he being hunted?
$C: Motorcycle

California

This man has huge balls.
$C: What is going on with Keanu posts? This is like the 3rd one to hit the front page in as many days. New movie coming out?
$C: "Where's my car?"
$C: Is Keanu god?
$C: You can't lie to me I can recognise a wild v-sauce when I see one
$C: In 2000 (the year) I saw Keanu's band "Dogstar' at a divey bar/nightclub on the Illinois side of St. Louis.  He was at the bar after the show and engaging in conversations with anybody, and I mean anybody.   Not at all acting "snooty" or Hollywood.   It does not surprise me at all to hear all the stories about how nice he is in real life.  I think it's genuine.  
$C: That guy is everywhere. 
$C: I feel so bad for him with all that selfish assholes like OP. 
$C: This dude is popping up everywhere. It's a damn glitch in the matrix.
$C: Studio city! I used to live right by there :O
$C: Doesn't this look like he roams around a lot these days or does Reddit love him? 

$C: What town is this that people keep seeing Keanu in? I gotta go there, and just walk around town until I finally meet him. 
$C: Such a sick bike. The Norton Command[o] is an absolute classic. 

Edit: typ
$C: HAHHAHAHHA!! He's just chillin!! 
$C: What kind of style is this bike? I love the way it looks. The flat seat especially.
$C: He didn‚Äôt John wick you and hit you with his bike ?
$C: Those old Norton's can be worth a lot $$$
Usually the only places you can see them in public are at automotive concours events

$C: I like his bike.
$C: Woah 
$C: What was the conversation that you had with him? That's what I'd really like to know.
$C: I've been crushing on him since I was a preteen and saw him in Bill and Ted's Excellent  Adventure; pushing 40 and I still dig him. 
$C: Is this on Ventura? Looks like Ventura.
$C: Sweet bike!
$C: Is there a reason why Keanu is so popular these days on Reddit? I've been seeing him pop up on social media a lot.
$C: Nice bike too!  
$C: Gorgeous motorcycle.  
$C: Why does he not have his own sub Reddit 

$C: Keanu has been all over reddit lately. 
$C: Every time i see pictures of Keanu it's always wholesome somehow. 

$C: Man this dude gets so much love everywhere he goes
$C: He‚Äôs so rad. 
$C: What were you driving at the time?
$C: Aww! He looks so happy! Hi, Keanu! I will never get to meet you in person but I hope you have a wonderful day! Love the bike! Cheers!
$C: A picture of Neo on Reddit and he doesn't look depressed!  He enjoys his bikes.  He looks happy.
$C: Keanu likes the taste of bugs. Only bugs can sustain him.
$C: I wish I could be his friend. 
$C: He was here [Winnipeg] a while back...mid-90's, doing Hamlet.  Pre-Matrix but he was already pretty well known.  It was after Speed, Bill and Ted, Point Break, and a lot of other movies already.

He walked to work, even though it was January, and with no bodyguard.

He was embarrassed at being seen in a limo once, which he got because his Mom was in town visiting on her birthday.

He's a regular guy.
$C: I feel like so many people meet Keanu Reeves. it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs everywhere...
$C: Keanu Reeves has excellent taste in motorcycles, nice one mate.
$C: Keanu Revs up the engine, Keanu Leaves
$C: Why do I feel like that's the Ralphs on Coldwater Canyon? 
$C: It looks like he wants to go where you‚Äôre going.
$C: Haha nice, i would love to take a ride with him :D
$C: Wild Keanu sighting upvote for good luck!
$C: ...Morpheus??
$C: That bike is sweet!!!
$C: A few years back I read that Keanu likes to spend his birthdays having dinner alone to ruminate about the past year in his life. This was like, fifteen years ago that I read this but I thought that it was such a cool idea that I adopted for myself. When my birthday rolls around, I turn everything off and just spend the day alone and... holy shit, it's seriously one of the best ways to spend a birthday.
$C: Whoa!
$C: Are we having a world wide Where‚Äôs Waldo with Keanu Reeves that I did not know about?
$C: Hey Vsause Michael here 
$C: A buddy of mine knows someone who works on Keanu‚Äôs bikes. They were going to go riding together and Keanu‚Äôs mechanic said he could come along for the ride. This guy fucking slept in. HE SLEPT IN and missed an opportunity to go riding with The One 
$C: Keanu is badass. 
$C: Yeah i believe it would be really fun to hang out with him.
$C: He seems like such a lowkey normal guy.
$C: Someone fill me because I obviously missed something. What‚Äôs up with the Keanu pics? 
$C: It looks like the intersection of Doheny and Beverly Blvd.
$C: He looks a lot like my cousin in this picture, same bike and helmet. My cousin has different goggles, though.
$C: Your a lucky person
$C: Cool guy upvote for the bike 
$C: I knew he lived in the valley 
$C: He's on a fucking Norton, he just got more badass than I ever gave him credit for.
$C: Is finding Keanu reeves becoming or has it always been a meme?
$C: Someone needs to make a Keanu Reeves subreddit
$C: Fuck that's hot. I'm so jealous. 
$C: Is there a subreddit for people who meet Keanu Reeves in the wild?
$C: Makes me wet
$C: Is it just me or does he look like he's posing for the picture?

That's cool of him. 
$C: Cool as ice. 
$C: What type/style  of bike is this. I want to get my bike license this summer. It's like the one robin had in Batman and robin. 
$C: Just Neo riding around town. Just living in the Matrix.
$C: How sure are you that you weren‚Äôt in the matrix 
$C: What's with the influx in Keanu sightings? Is he just always out and about lol
$C: I'm convinced Keanu just spends his free time showing up at random places and waiting for fans to take pictures for Reddit...
$C: This dude is everywhere at the same time
$C: "Look into my eyes. To maintain my eternal youth I'm going to have to suck out your soul." 
$C: For real? :p Hawkeye suits you better as a nickname!

P.S.
Under these circumstances I might see Brad Pitt, and not recognise him...
$C: Inb4 Photoshop battles 
$C: Erm, feels like a glitch in the Matrix
$C: Where were you at?
$C: The motorcycle could be Trinity's old one.
$C: such an LA photo
$C: Cool bike!
$C: What a fucking squid 
$C: Is it just me or die he look like markplier? 
$C: I recognize this intersection. [Coldwater & Ventura Blvd](https://www.google.com/maps/@34.14511,-118.4136153,3a,75y,191.18h,77.9t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sC5p5RmpZdhVjzKcs_Kf4Qg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656).
$C: Maybe it's because the angle is just funny and he has a helmet on but it doesn't look like his nose and is that a gap between his teeth?
$C: Love that dude
$C: Keanu is like a celebrity cryptid you are most likely to find him accidentaly in mundane places than at awards shows or something
$C: I'm convinced he does nothing but hang out and wait for Redditors to find him all over town now.
$C: The man has taste when it comes to bikes (a Norton commander?) 
$C: Why is he so FUCKING cool?
$C: He rides his motorcycle without any fear of death because he is immortal
$C: Keanu always seems like such a genuinely nice person. It always makes me sad to think about what happened in his life.
$C: Nice bike!
$C: i'm a little shocked that he doesn't ride an arch motorcycle!
$C: Woah. 
$C: Can we get a r/PSbattle on this too? We can call it "Keanu II" after that other weird Russia one.
$C: Swooonn
$C: (Was Keanu real?) What is real? How do you define 'real'? If you're talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then 'real' is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain. Morpheus, The Matrix.
$C: With a fucking pencil!! Who tf can do that?!?
$C: I swear the only pictures I've seen of Mr Reeves smiling is when one of his motorcycles are in the same pic.
$C: Seems like a good one for r/motorcycles. 
$C: You working again?
$C: I met trinity(carrie Ann moss) by accident asking for directions. And she acted exactly like trinity.
$C: Protests the NFL, Keanu Knees 
$C: Where is this magical place where Keanu Reeves just keeps popping up out of nowhere? 
$C: Man I'd love to have a sesh with him, smoke some bowls. I reckon he'd spit so much fire from his brain it'd be fucking great. 
$C: Drove by Owen Wilson on his bicycle on Maui, he wasn‚Äôt as friendly. 
$C: I just like to picture him as John Wick on another mission to knock someone off everytime i see another pic
$C: I wonder what the exchange here was. Its got me laughing a little, would love to know the conversation. Get the impression he's just stopped at the lights, gave some important life advice, and then before you've had the time to process what just happened he's set off to find the next mortal to import advice to.

Keanu is so cool.
$C: Reeves 2020

"He is the one" 
$C: He looks cross eyed.
$C: is that ventura and laurel ? I met Jay Leno in that Ralphs on weekends
$C: what is it that makes a sighting of Keanu make it to the top?   
$C: Wow on a Norton Commando too...very nice machine and he seems to keep it in great shape :) Lucky guy. 
$C: House?
$C: Totally random right? That's what I love about life, you just never  know. 
$C: Keanu my ass! That‚Äôs Johnny Utah 
$C: "Meeting"
$C: **cool**
$C: That's badass!!!
$C: This guy or Dwayne Johnson have got to be the coolest dudes ever. 
$C: Said it once, say it again. Man's a fucking legend.
$C: Ridning a Norton! That man has class! 
$C: King of the road haha
$C: My God he's so fucking handsome.

$C: I though Wick‚Äôs car was fixed and on the run, why‚Äôs he staring right at people. 
$C: Cool movies aside, I just want to go check out his bike shop.
$C: Uuuuugh, and he has my dream bike? Stop being so damned cool Keanu! 
$C: Op must have some sort of ebsession woth this guy if you look his profile he doesn't post anything else and has a shit loaf of karma
$C: Reddit really likes Keanu Reeves.
$C: I like Keanu, I'm aware of his charitable contributions and he's just a cool guy but I don't actually understand why Reddit is this obsessed with him. 163K upvotes for this? 
$C: I have a feeling Keanu is taking pictures of himself and posting these on his many accounts for that sweet sweet karma.
$C: Why were you meeting him there? Drug deal?
$C: Whoaaa! That's totally righteous!
$C: Keanu has to be the most liked celebrity on Reddit. He always gets hundreds of thousands of upvotes....I wish I was Keanu Reeves.
$C: I feel like everyone always sees him everywhere. Unlike any other celebrity. 
$C: Woah!!
$C: /PUBG 
$C: Im pretty sure that is the rapper  lil dicky.
$C: 


1+
$C: Wish I could be his friend
$C: But does he know dey wey
$C: I swear, every single day, someone meets Keanu somewhere in the world, and posts it on Reddit. 
$C: Thought it said knife fight at first glance 
$C: I think it's cool how I always see Keanu reeves on Reddit, always in a positive manner.  It's like hey there is Keanu reeves again doing cool shit. 
$C: He‚Äôs 53. Fifty fucking three. I‚Äôll have whatever he‚Äôs having. 
$C: What a cutie
$C: ..whoa
$C: That is one sexy motorcycle. 
$C: nice bike!
$C: Cool picture, but what a telling amount of upvotes. This is the most upvotes I've ever seen on here and it's just a picture of a famous guy. 
$C: I cannot forgive Johnny Mnemonic.  
$C: Please leave his dog alone.
$C: Again new capter of Wick will be presented soon. Ads got smarter and smarter
$C: I love how is seems to always be really happy to interact with fans. No mayter what I know he would just be like, "absolutely, lets take a picture"

Them you see so many celebrities freaking out on fans and having body guards shove them away.

Keanu needs no body guards, amd is genuine. 
$C:  Feel like there‚Äôs no way you could recognize him with the helmet and the goggles, yet the sheer number of upvotes is convincing me that it‚Äôs actually him.

I personally would describe him as ‚Äúa guy who sort of looks like Reeves.‚Äù
$C: He's a great guy, till you fuck with his dog... 
$C: Sexiest man alive! 
$C: Is Keanu Reeves the new Bill Murray?
$C: Keanu Reeves been on Reddit a lot lately. You have this post, you have the post of his hover hands, and you also have the post of him with a little girl in a grocery store getting a picture
$C: Meeting reposts on Reddit.
$C: üòç
$C: Best human ever. 
$C: This guy is everywhere!
$C: People sure do like this Keanu 
$C: nice bike.  probly bought it off mike and frank.
$C: I'm glad he's wearing a helmet.
$C: Fuck!!! My dad had a 750 Norton Commando when he was young! Cool....
$C: Makes sense he'd be on a Norton. 

I love him ever more. 

Keanu, if you ever see this,  I respect you so much.
$C: Is that the Ralph's on 3rd?
$C: Looks like vsauce
$C: Tinus!
$C: so cool.
$C: Love Keanu, such a great guy. I would like to meet him. I'm saving my Masterball for that one special and rare encounter one day.
 ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)¬†
$C: He looks smaller than expected.  R u sure?
$C: I would get out my car and cheeckly jump on the back of his bike. 
$C: JUST ME OR IS THAT BIKE TO SMALL ü¶ç
$C: Good eye. There‚Äôs no way I wouldn‚Äôt just assume he was just some dude. 
$C: As you pulled away you should've yelled " I KNOW KUNG FU!"
$C: Real men wear helmets...and steal paparazzi cameras.
$C: I know that intersection from my childhood 
$C: I would fist bump this man.
$C: There was a recent post saying something like "If you could die and come back as any celebrity, who would it be?"

The answer was right in front of my face
$C: I better keep my eyes open, he might be next to me next time!
$C: Totally righteous dude!
$C: Of course he has impeccable taste in bikes.
$C: I'm not sure I would have even noticed the rider.  The Norton 750 Commando has been one of my dream bikes for as long as I can remember and that is a beautiful example.
$C: Love this man
$C: Is this a cafe racer 
$C: I would have hauled ass home, gotten my bike, hauled ass back....only to realize I was dumb enough to think I could make it back in time to ride with Keanu.
$C: He's everywhere !!!
$C: Good human. 
$C: BABA YAGA!
$C: u/unknown_human 
Which intersection is this?
(The Ralph's Market helps a little)
Awesome picture!!
$C: Looks more like Marc Maron
$C: Nice bike.
$C: I wish *I* could meet Keanu Reeves at a traffic light
$C: can you believe it, i had the very same motorcycle when i was in the navy in norfolk va. sure miss that bike but not norfolk haha.
$C: Sure it ain't markiplier?
$C: Keanu needs a podcast. He's a real car bro too 
$C: I've watched this post off/on all day. From 3000 karma all the way up to 170000. Like watching something important come into being.  

Really I should be paying more attention at work 
$C: I would take a glance at him and think it was Vsauce Michael 
$C: He looks sorta like Robert Downy Jr. in this photo.
$C: 750 snorting Norton hope he doesn‚Äôt drop it because you will have to help him pick it up
$C: Did you ask him how much for the bike?
$C: See, helmets are cool!
$C: And hes even riding a damned good bike.  I love Nortons
$C: Who wouldn't want to marry him?
I mean, c'mon. He was Neo. John Wick. 

And he respects the ladies. 
I'm read to find my Keanu. 
$C: That pose looks like the most interesting man pose. 
$C: Hey, I was just talking to a guy in another thread about him picking motorcycles up after a movie as a hobby.
$C: This is like the 3rd time in a day I‚Äôve seen Keanu Reeves on the front page of reddit. What‚Äôs going on here? 
$C: miss my motorcycle a lot now as I'm in canada now. The thing is western countries requires a different licence in order to drive 2-wheelers whereas mine country requires none(legally they do). It is feeling many people here don't experience I think.
$C: He is just amazing! Thank you for sharing!
$C: 176 000 upvotes! In nine hours!That‚Äôs over 300 a minute, 176000 is like the population of st Lucia. Congrats and wow.
$C: I know exactly where that is. the ralphs on ventura and coldwater.  that corner hasnt changed in decades. 
$C: I‚Äôve loved this guy for the past twenty three years since seeing Speed. I‚Äôm still salty that I left my Keanu scrap book at a hotel when I was 12 - a book dedicated to magazine cuttings of his beautiful face.

Seems I won‚Äôt be getting over this crush any time soon. 
$C: Lookalike?! 
$C: He really be out here in these streets for real!
$C: Whose dad
$C: One of the coolest celebrities out there. Maintaining his sanity very well thank you. Fame can fuck you up.
$C: Agree. He always seems so happy to pose for fans. Love him.
$C: Norton, that‚Äôs my dogs name
$C: "No one will believe you....wait, delete that picture!"
$C: Woah!
$C: You would think he would be riding one of his own bikes from his bike company

$C: Am I the only one who hasn‚Äôt run into this man?!
$C: 4000 comments, yay!
$C: HOW IS HE EVERYWHERE
$C: Ahh cool it‚Äôs John wick
$C: We served him at our restaurant. He asked my gf to split his checküòé
$C: That Norton!
$C: I thought he rode the subway 
$C: The greatest human being in history.
$C: Ventura & Coldwater Canyon.  The busiest intersection in the San Fernando Valley....
$C: I love Vsauce!
$C: He's everywhere!
$C: Is that at Olympic and Barrington? 
$C: Best reddit post ever! Love this guy!
$C: You should‚Äôve asked him if he was working again.
$C: He's a such a wonderful man.
$C: What a cutie 
$C: Why does it make me happy to know Keanu has a Norton Commando? Yet, it does.
$C: Hey Vsauce, Michael here
$C: I love that Keanu is such a good sport and will take so many pictures with people that I‚Äôve seen like ten on reddit so far
$C: Always showing up in the CRAZIEST of places!
$C: I envy you dude......
$C: Holy shit the upvotes on this!
$C: wonder why he isn't riding one of his own motorcycle company's bikes
$C: Ventura Blvd.
$C: He seems to be everywhere xD. On bus stops, airports, now on motorcycles. Guy seems to like traveling.
$C: Johnnie 'Fuckin'' Utah
$C: I've read that Brian Blessed taught Keanu meditation during filming of "Much Ado About Nothing," a film I'd *love* to see deleted scenes from, since Keanu *had* to have had more scenes, for the plot.  I'm wondering if this is true, because it seems so...opposite.


$C: I was like, ‚ÄúKeanu!!!‚Äù
$C: a Norton... much respect
$C: Agree. He always seems so happy to pose for fans. Love him.
$C: Please take me with you!!!‚ù§Ô∏èüíó
$C: Corner of Ventura and Coldwater Canyon in Studio City if anyone is curious.
$C: It would be really nice of him to ship me that fucking Norton. I've wanted one my entire life! 
$C: He's everywhere!
$C: Is Keano Reeves to Reddit what Bill Murray is to the Chive? 
$C: I miss the good ol‚Äô days when we rightfully made fun of him for his terrible acting. I thought we were united on this, folks. I missed the transition!
$C: Like that
$C: Badass for sure
$C: That is Dr. House, don't you lie to me. 
$C: Man crash level: Keanu is my jam
$C: Norton Commander? wtf?!
$C: He should really wear a full face helmet. 
$C: Not everyone gets it
http://imgur.com/0ldUqbv
$C: Because deep down, their darkest truths, Keanu Believes
$C: He‚Äôs everywhere! I think he‚Äôs working for Bill Murray 
$C: has everyone met keanu reeves this week or what
$C: Sherman Oaks?
$C: whoa!
$C: I‚Äôd rather meet a real life hero like a paramedic a doctor a firefighter then any movie star.
$C: 

See you can tell when it is only a popular sort of affection like a squash. In any case, what we have for Keanu and Terry is more. Considerably more. 
$C: hey r/motorcycles
$C: I thought that was Michael from vsauce at first 
$C: I thought that was Michael from vsauce at first 
$C: I thought that was Michael from vsauce at first 
$C: that looks photoshopped.  Either that or keanu is ridiculously photogenic. 
$C: Is that cold water canyon and Ventura?
$C: Norton's are badass bikes but too bad it's not a BSA or a Triumph....  old school Commando 750 nice!
$C: He really does seem like one of the coolest, most genuine dudes around!
$C: Ffs everyone and their dad is meeting him in irl and me no üò°üò°üò†
$C: I love seeing some random post I scrolled past suddenly in the top upvotes posts of all time
$C: Whoaaa! That's totally righteous!
$C: Coolest guy alive
$C: How fucking cool is that guy?
$C: I though Wick‚Äôs car was fixed and on the run, why‚Äôs he staring right at people. 
$C: my spirit animal....naturally
$C: My spirit animal 
$C: Is that the ralph's in studio city on ventura? 
$C: Hilarious 
$C: Is he the only celebrity that goes out in public? He is seriously one of the most shilled on reddit
$C: /r/orgy
$C: .
$C: He's on a new motorcycle everytime I see him
$C: looks like the bike from the superbowl commercial
$C: Reeves is like the good looking version of Bill Murray.
$C: How bout lets comment on this beautiful unchopped Norten hes riding
$C: He's the only one you could meet like that, as Trinity ignores traffic lights
$C: "Now Nortons and Indians and Greavses won't do.
Oh, they don't have a Soul like a Vincent '52."
$C: hell yeah
$C: The actual dopest shit that could ever happen
$C: What a beautiful life people are living i wish I could also live that kind of a life
$C: Meet or take photo of? 
$C: H E Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y üëãüèºüëãüèºüëãüèº
$C: I KNOW
$C: I'm a simple man. I see Keanu Reeves, I upvote.
$C: Where was this taken?
$C: What a terrific man, cant wait for bill and ted three. Im sure he will donate profits, he seems to always do so.
$C: All I can hear is "JOHN WICK" in the back of my head, repeating that name over and over, whenever I see Keanu.
$C: Looks like VSauce Michael.
$C: Just gonna say Kanaal forever
$C: What happened to his car?
$C: And off to the archive it goes 
$C: Fun fact. I wrecked one of these when I was a teenager. Was told if I could start it I could ride it. I paid $1500 to learn I could in fact, not ride it just because I could start it. üòÇ
$C: It's good to see him but I wish he would loose the bike.  Lost somebody wen I was a kid and when I see any of my friends on a bike I kinda mentally withdraw from them so when the inevitable happens it doesn't hurt as much. Not like Keanu would ever be my friend or anything like that but I just worry. Bikes suck 
$C: Wow! That‚Äôs amazing! Want to know a cool fact about our friend Keanu? Keanu loves Pepsi¬ÆÔ∏è and drinks it at every meal! We met with Keanu back in 2015 and he told us that he loves our product Pepsi¬ÆÔ∏è more than anything in the whole world! Want to be more like Keanu? Take the ‚Äúred pill‚Äù, or a sip of Pepsi¬ÆÔ∏è and see how deep the rabbit hole goes.

Delicious. Refreshing. Pepsi¬ÆÔ∏è.
$C: So is Keanu Reeves a thing now..?

Edit: I meant as in the fact that I‚Äôve been seeing him around a lot, I‚Äôm aware of his popularity 
$C: Great choice in bike!
$C: You were wearing a red dress, weren't you?
$C: How come he's not riding an Arch?
$C: $10 says you won‚Äôt steal his bike and kill his dog just to see what happens 
$C: Glad Keanu Reeves is coming back in everyone's hearts and minds, if only reddit could get brendan fraser another mummy movie to put him back on track
$C: Ralph‚Äôs on Beverly?!
$C: Wait, is that the Ralphs on Beverly and Doheny?! I was there today. I live literally 5 min away on Crescent and Lexington. 

Small World. Lol
$C: Idk why but this looks like the parking lot near the apartment Trevor lived in by Vespucci beach, when he first moved to los santos.
$C: Not gonna lie...he's one of those people that I probably wouldn't recognize on the streets until someone points out that it's him.
$C: It's cool he's smiling. Kind of reinforces his reputation as being a really nice guy in person.
$C: Is it Keanu, or just a dude who might look like him? I genuinely can't tell.
$C: I really wanna marry this guy
$C: Piano Reeves
$C: Dude, clean your lens.
$C: Why are you all stalking him?
$C: He looks so much like Michael from Vsauce at first glance

$C: Hey ! Vsauce Michael here
$C: https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/comments/7ppba7/roast_us_all/?st=JCAPX9P9&sh=e303aa51
$C: Like what's this guy doing? It sure isn't making movies tho.
$C: Are we just going to have a picture of him everyday of the year? 
$C: There are only 3 celebrities that I would love to just have as friends. Thats Dave Chappelle, LeBron James Keanu Reeves. These guys seem cool as hell. 
$C: /r/pics is well on its way to becoming /r/picturesofKeanuReeves
$C: Best celebrity ever,respects his fans and is never stuckup
$C: Woah.
$C: What shoes is he wearing? I want a pair.
$C: Ok now this is getting ridiculous. Make a subreddit already!
$C: I bet he was yelling at you to get off your cell phone after you almost ran him off the road. Amirite OP?
$C: Why has there been so many posts about Keanu recently? Is a new movie starring him coming out or something.
$C: Why is this guy always on my feed and why 145k upvotes in 6 hours? Cool, you met a celebrity. But why is this upvoted so much and so often? 
$C: He is the epitome of what it means to be excellent to one another. 
$C: Fuck's sake, people. He's driving, not showing up to your personal photo op.
$C: Guys, what the hell is Reddit's obsession with Keanu Reeves? He's on the front-page almost every day
$C: i need karma pls
$C: Wit is reddits obsession with this cunt all about man. Fucking plenty  
$C: Looks more like the vsause guy
$C: Where the hell do you people live where you keep running into this guy? Posts of random encounters with him seem pretty common
$C: Just one time I want to meet him. One of the very, very few celebrities I want to meet. 
$C: Kee-nue-nue Reh-ahh-ves
$C: Out of the corner of your eye you spot him...Keanu Reeves (?)
$C: There should be a subreddit just for people who find Keanu Reeves randomly. 
$C: Lol, that bike looks ridiculously small on him.
$C: Dammit Keanu....
$C: Lucky
$C: With a pencil
$C: I thought he owned a motorcycle company ? so why is he riding a Norton ? in fact why is he riding a British Bike at all ?? 

$C: You'd think with all the money he has made he'd be able to buy himself a taller bike. 
$C: Isn't that vsauce Michael?
$C: Hey Vsauce, Michael here
$C: heyyyy vsauce. michael here.
$C: Well played. Who needs their kidneys anyways.
$C: The hell‚Äôs wrong with you, weirdo?  Why are you making so many posts of pictures of him and then flaunting all the other posts you have of him by providing us links?  

I‚Äôm very curious.  Do you know you‚Äôre a weirdo and are the way you are anyway, or are you oblivious socially and have no idea you‚Äôre scary?

Wasn‚Äôt there a post recently about how do you know if someone‚Äôs unstable?  Can I nominate OP?
$C: I wish he wouldn't ride motorcycles. I'd like him to be around longer. 
$C: Lol, he looks like Markiplier with those goggles.
$C: [removed]
$C: He's the One.
$C: Cool, he's not riding one of their $80k choppers
$C: Yeah that's Keanu Reeves alright. Again. 

Why do people think this fucking guy needs to be on here every day?
$C: I love Keanu, but seeing him on a motorcycle so much just makes me cringe.  They're so dangerous.
$C: What a cool guy. Would be fun to hang out with 
$C: I don't ride, but bikers face a danger well beyond their zone of control with texting on the part of other drivers. People are just not aware enough at all on the roads. One small tap from a car to a bike can be fatal. It's such a risk you can't assess or account for. Hats off to bikers.
$C: r/wedontdeservekeanu

$C: Seems like a very real, cool person. Someone to have discussions with, exchange thoughts.
$C: Dang...an old Norton...sweet...
$C: I got to admit, Keanu has some balls to ride a motorcycle around LA, especially at night. Drivers here are nuts. 
$C: Did you tell him he's a terrible actor? 
$C: 163k upvotes... Really? It's a celeb on a bike, whoop di doo
$C: ‚ÄúKeanu Reeves?‚Äù
‚ÄúYep that‚Äôs m‚Äî‚Äú *shutter click*
$C: That looks so fake. Is his head really that big?

kucoin.com/#/?r=1v7QP
$C: Wow 122k updates for one of the worst actors.
$C: Oh, look, another custom $89,000 motorcycle.

Must be nice.

$C: howd you know it was him?

not calling him a liar, just saying it would be hard for me to identify anyone thats in motorcycle gear in the night time before the sensitive people here flood the downvote button.
$C: Do you think Keanu Reeves knows he is trending on Reddit? We should get him to do an AMA at this point haha.

Don‚Äôt know why I am getting downvotes... not trying to be an asswhole
$C: keanu is literally the coolest dude alive at this point.
$C: Keanu Reeves for president!
$C: [deleted]
$C: Who's the hipster loser on the combustion bicycle? 
$C: That's dumb

My buddy just died on a motorcycle
$C: I wonder who would be in the list of top 5 Reddit favorite celebrities. I would say Terry Crews belongs in there.
$C: Keanu for President 2020!

/s
$C: What happened to Zach Braff? He was going to be our chosen one.
$C: If he turns out to be a diddler, I will kill myself.
$C: Nah the guy who played mini me (Vern?) is the guy who Reddit has the biggest circle jerk around. Always front page top post. I'll never understand that one. 
$C: I‚Äôd like to hang out with him and Bill Murray. They should be friends.
$C: He's everybody's favorite guy.
$C: Please don't give him a times up
$C: Bill Murray?
$C: Ooooo Dave Grohl is gonna be sooo pissed
$C: Is a goodboi 11/10
$C: until the Mongolians of "good guys" show up: the #meToo movement. 
$C: He's experiencing Liam Neeson syndrome. It's when the old guy saves the world a couple times. It reminds you of your father or the father you never had. Also the type of person you want to be when you are older yourself. Still active in such.
$C: I feel like he's the new Bill Murray.
$C: Leonardo Di Caprio would like a word ;)
$C: He must have a movie coming out soon
$C: Don't jinx it. 
$C: Why is he favored so much?
$C: I wonder if he knows that? 
$C: I'm not your good guy, good chief.
$C: Damn, now you've jinxed it. His inevitable fall from grace will come soon now.
$C: You cant grope women when youre riding a motorcycle , hes always been a good Boy Scout
$C: no. there's just a huge viral ad campaign on him going for a while due to his john wick movies and now his motorcycle company. that's what op's post is. a viral ad for his motorcycle company. all the keanu is such a nice guy posts are for his movies.
$C: Nicolas Cage for the win 
$C: I think we need a Reddit badge just for the lucky few
$C: Perhaps the fact that Keanu was intensely looking at them when they were pulled up beside each other?
$C: This is OP's 6th Keanu post. He must've recognized him.
$C: He is *the one* 
$C: It actually could be my ex's cousin. 

Dude literally looked exactly like Keanu Reeves. We went to the mall one time together, and 30 minutes into it he had a crowd of 15 people around him, none believing him when he was saying "I'm NOT Kenau Reeves!"

He said it was a blessing and a curse. He had a hard time going anywhere in public.
$C: Traffic lights in LA are looooooooooooong.  You could put a dent in a novel while waiting for the green.
$C: Because this social media campaign is in full throttle right now...
$C: I never would have made it past drooling over the Norton. 
$C: Its a lot easier if you just immediately ask everyone you meet if they‚Äôre Keanu Reeves 
$C: Totally get that.... Like I know the Bang Van is driving around on LA Freeways and I'm always kinda looking out for it but I never see it.  

But I wonder how many times it may have passed by and all I noticed was a van because I didn't have the time to really check it out.
$C: Seriously. I straight up talked to Greg Kinnear and Billy Crudup for like 10 minutes once and didn't realize until afterwards.

And I am definitely familiar with both actors. My brain just wasn't connecting their faces to their celebrity.

I wonder how many other times that has happened to me, lol
$C: Gotta look alive at the stop lights in LA.  Plus OP potentially spotting him prior to red light, prepped the camera for the stop. 
$C: They probably noticed him at a prior light and followed him to the next one to get the photo..
$C: OPis Keanu duh
$C: I mean you gotta take a second look at that bike. And then you notice the little details.
$C: i feel like it probably was just a guy asking to take a pic of the bike as it's a sweet looking ride. Turns out it was being ridden by none other than Keanu.
$C: Cause he is at the speed of life
$C: From my experience in America, their lights take forever to change compared to what the traffic lights are like in the UK. 
$C: I don‚Äôt think he is at a light. It looks more like he is on the grass next to the road. 
$C: Keanu appears to be in grass or something, definitely not on the road. 
$C: Maybe he is stalking him.
$C: r/2meirl4meirl
$C: I‚Äôd be staring at the bike, give him a thumbs up if he looked over and jump out of my fucking skin when I saw it was Keanu. 
$C: They probably noticed that sweet Norton he was riding, THEN they noticed who was riding it.
$C: Dude's got an aura. 

Much like Leroy Green, he's got the Glow. 

I think it's fitting that his glow is gold/yellow. Just seems right.


Going to watch The Last Dragon, then Matrix trilogy, then JW1&2. 

Thanks much for helping me plan my day! 
$C: Maybe the traffic lights where he lives are like the ones where I live; I could write a fucking opera while waiting.
$C: He sees everything. He‚Äôs... in the Matrix.
$C: Just look for the sweet vintage Norton. 
$C: His license plate is NEO
$C: I feel the same way when I see posts about people recognizing someone.

I go to a lot of music festivals and try to get up close to the stage when I‚Äôm really excited about a particular band.

Days later when I‚Äôm going through social media and articles looking at people‚Äôs videos and pictures from the festival, I‚Äôll see that I was standing right next to or in front of some models/celebrities and never even realized it.
$C: Because it's a rare Norton! 
$C: That's the at light cold water and ventura...it is a long light
$C: I picture Keanu yelling "HEY IT'S ME, KEANU" at every stop light.
$C: WITNESS MEEEE!!!!
$C: That's not even the big question. The big one is, how did they notice then take a picture? Only answer for that I have is they took a still from their Go-Pro. But people usually helmet mount those and this is from an extremely low angle for that.

So my guess is, they noticed him while riding and hit a few lights together. They probably BS'd at the lights and asked if they could snap a picture and then got one at the night lights. Which is why he is looking and isn't looking annoyed or upset.
$C: The bike man! I like that it's the same one that was in the recent video where someone backed into it. Makes him seem more "real".
$C: It was prob one of the socal lights that take 5-7 mins to change.
$C: You see him at light A and take picture at light B. or magic
$C: Yeah Reddit either really loves him or its a marketing thing
$C: Saw him once after his band had played in town, he seemed like a giant douchebag, but he also seemed pretty drunk. I know I can be guilty of the same when I'm slammed though
$C: At this stage I‚Äôm convinced Keanu just follows people who stare at their phone in hopes that they‚Äôre redditors. Once it gets posted, he then reposts it for free Karma.
$C: Why is everyone obsessed with him
$C: You can feel his presence. 
$C: My wife would know.  She recognized him by the shoes he was wearing.  She‚Äôs a fan.
$C: Both vehicles were travelling at 45mph when the picture was taken. 
$C: This is how he always stops at traffic lights. 
$C: This is what happened when I saw queen latifah lmao
$C: You just have to learn how to recognize him. Once you do you'll be seeing him at a traffic light probably once or twice a week.
$C: Could have seen him before they stopped at the light and was ready. 
$C: Keanu notices him.
$C: The light did change, there is even a blurry car too.
$C: while Keanu might have a red arrow,  
I'm pretty sure whoever took the photo has a green light.  
notice the green light for traffic opposite them and red for the cross traffic?  
it's been green long enough for a car to get through the intersection.
$C: The norton would tip me off.....how many dudes are tooling around on Nortons.
$C: Motorcyclists tend to be a bunch of bros and will chat at stop lights
$C: Because the picture is fake, it's done by public relations firm.
$C: EDIT: Created a sub: /r/KeanuBeingAwesome

EDIT 2: Whoa, this is the comment that started it all.

Just checked, this is my 6th post of Keanu on Reddit. I absolutely love this man.
$C: Reddit loves Keanu...and I'm starting to get used to seeing him around... probably miss him if he disappears
$C: It's just a glitch in the matrix.
$C: Seems like a viral marketing campaign to me.
$C: Probably advertising for a new movie coming up? 
$C: Neo is also trending on /r/CryptoCurrency
$C: There has to be more than the ONE.
$C: Excellent!!  _skierdoodadeedabbadooo!_ üé∏
$C: The next generation Bill Murray. 
$C: Needs his own sub if you ask me 
$C: New Bill Murray
$C: Well yeah it has passive income benefits for HODLing and has a ton of teams developing on their platform.  
$C: NEO cryptocurrency is Da Hongfei.
$C: Seems like he'll let anyone take a pic of him, which is commendable.
$C: whats the over/under on how long it takes before reddit turns him into someone we all collectively hate a la jennifer lawrence?
$C: ...and nowhere. But mostly everywhere.
$C: Watch out, Morpheus has every homeless guy on his payroll and is watching you.
$C: He‚Äôs there when we need him.
$C: Agreed. All over the place 
$C: My first thought as well.
$C: Seriously! What, does he have a movie coming out or something??
$C: This. Was thinking the same thing. He's such a badass though. 
$C: Everything I have seen makes me want to hang out with him. 
$C: Looks like hes having a nice day too.
$C: Reddit is stalking Keanu confirmed.

$C: I‚Äôve never joined a sub so fast.  Love that guy.
$C: It's bound to happen when you time travel as much as he does
$C: Y'all keep posting pics of Keanu Reeves but we all know he's not real.
$C: Thats because he jusy seems like a genuinely cool dude.
$C: It‚Äôs insane
$C: Seriously I was thinking the same thing. I think reddit is in love with this guy
$C: It‚Äôs because he is the chosen one
$C: My thoughts exactly. May it be a glitch in the matrix? 
$C: I would be devastated if we found put Keanu was involved in some scandal. 
$C: reddit has made me appreciate this man so much. not only is he super cool in person, but he‚Äôs super cool in spite of having lived through some really rough shit.

keep the keanu karma rolling :)
$C: Jesus?
$C: The year of the reeves 
$C: Yea build him up and up and up. And then what will happen?
$C: Utah! Give me two.
$C: Just watched it a few hours ago before bed for the first time 
$C: Reddit *is* the gateway to the matrix.
$C: I'm just waiting for people to turn on him a few months down the road. 
$C: If it were not for Keanu I would have no hope for humanity given the state of the entertainment industry. Thank you Keanu.
$C: For real, what is happening? Its like reddit is a K-Reeves Advent Calendar or something.
$C: Neo, so hot right now.
$C: I came to make the same comment and inquire as to why?
$C: You seem surprised. This is a social media site after all. Probably here to peddle his latest Bob Candle action movie installment. 
$C: Reddit has turned into a Keanu Reeves sighting page.
$C: He's experiencing Neeson syndrome
$C: Dude is just a legend! 
$C: Yeah what going on with all these Neo encounters lately? Feel like I am missing something.
$C: Right now, reddit has a crush on him. That or successful viral marketing. 
$C: I came here to say That! Is he actually in the matrix? 
$C: Poor guy. Think about how annoying it can be. 
$C: Hahaha just felt the same here! He's been showing him self a lot here hahaha

$C: He‚Äôs the next Tom Hanks
$C: You people need to leave this fucking guy alone jesus.
$C: But seriously - when a baby, Keanu teethes
$C: But he is always on his own :(
$C: either that or the number of redditors is increasing and becoming more and more mainstream (than it already is)
$C: He's probably Reddit's favorite actor Reddit didn't hate after 1 year.
$C: Wait, since when is Keanu the new Chuck Norris?
$C: so much that i really hope he doesnt feel stalked more than usual
$C: Neo is trying to get the majority of reddit to take the red pill. 
$C: I think youre refering to Ted actually.
$C: We are every where!
$C: You spelled John Wick wrong 
$C: He went to get his pills...
$C: He is The One after all.
$C: You mean John Wick?
$C: Not sure if this is a CryptoCurrency joke, or if I've missed something else...
$C: He‚Äôs the last celebrity we have left :(
$C: You called?
$C: He's an attention whore and I love it. Cummies! 
$C: Neo doesn't ask.. Neo understands You..
$C: This guy r/guns
$C: Reddit is really Reeving the benefits on his behalf these days. 
$C: Neo knos de wey. 
$C: Prefer ETH
$C: To his home where he rolls up his Keanu Sleeves 
$C: Stealing everyone's heart, Keanu Thieves
$C: In being kind to people, Keanu believes. 
$C: Not before I get a picture, Keanu Please!
$C: John QWick
$C: Stealing everyone's heart, Keanu Thieves
$C: Okay. So. Seriously. It's not even two weeks into the the New Year and I have already seen Keanu Spotted many times. Someone just tell me there's got to be a subreddit for spotting this famously kind little cutie?

Edit: Spelling. 
$C: *Biyyyatch Please*
$C: When he thinks of John Wick‚Äôs dog, Keanu Grieves.
$C: It was you that Keanu sees
$C: This whole thing is easily my favorite thread on Reddit. Thank you kind sir for starting it. 
$C: What has become of this thread, cannot wait  until Keanu sees...
$C: That's laisist
$C: !redditsilver
$C: bunch of people stole what I was gonna say here..literally, Keanu Theeves...
$C: Or as the japanese would say, keanu reeves.
$C: Playin his trusty Pianu Keys 
$C: Upon Keanu, she deftly Queeves. 
$C: Man that‚Äôs a lot of jokes about Keanu jeez
$C: One of the best comment threads I‚Äôve read in a while.
$C: This comment and the comments that followed killed me. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
$C: Through the traffic he weaves
$C: How fickle reddit is not to gild your wit.
$C: We realize what we need , is more Keanu Reeves!
$C: That helmet covers well Keanu‚Äôs Weaves
$C: Standing on a hill in his vineyard, Keanu Oversees!
$C: And then he drives into traffic where, Keanu Weaves
$C: Keanu is really trending at the moment isn‚Äôt he. Thieves, Reeves, karma sleeze
$C: I name you winner of the Clutch Comment of my Commute award. 
$C: Keanu reeves. Karma please!
$C: Then I found out Keanu was part chinese
$C: Or if you're a Japanese salaryman: "Keanu Reaves"
$C: As soon as Keanu aReeves, Keanu Leaves
$C: This is the best comment ever. Lol
$C: To be honest as an Asian it's Keanu Reaves.
$C: This pun thread, Keanu Reeves
$C: Keanu say cheese
$C: Good jokes like this usually have gold . Strange .

edit . oh there it is 
$C: I thought he suddenly, Keanu Reaves
$C: Men. They‚Äôre all the same.
$C: After going to college, Keanu earns his degrees. 
$C: Rah that's what I said we saw him then he reft!
$C: This whole following thread sounds like a MGK rap
$C: Keanu Revs his engine.
$C: Which need to be cleared from Keanu‚Äôs Eaves
$C: When someone is suffering,Keanu Pities.
$C: !RedditSilver
$C: [Keanu comes back!](https://i.imgur.com/UNpeXmh.png)
$C: Cross him and you, in twain, he cleaves
$C: Doinky
$C: > And then just as suddenly, Keanu Leaves

And like that... he is gone.
$C: Look at the madness you started
$C: r/memeconomy
INVEST
$C: So glad I found this before going to work. Made my day...oh wait 
$C: Keanu giveth and Keanu taketh away
$C: First Keanu Revs 
$C: !RedditSilver
$C: lmao, i love you guys
$C: get out!
$C: I lile to think he read all these silly replies and gave out a tiny laugh. Keanu makes everything better.
$C: If that‚Äôs Keanu I‚Äôm Brad 
$C: And that‚Äôs how a meme is born
$C: I heard people go to him to get their Keanu Weaves 
$C: And Found Keanu's bodyguard!!!
$C: Because he‚Äôs gotta get Home and crack a cold one with Keanu Steve. 
$C: As mysteriously as he arrived...
$C: Or, if you're from Japan, Keanu Reeves
$C: Jobs, Harvey, Carell and Irwin are Keanu‚Äôs Steves
$C: And then somebody said Keanu Jeez

$C: But at his butcher shop, Keanu Cleaves 
$C: He already said it, but with an Asian accent.
$C: Rubs his dick, Keanu creams. 
$C: I have a canoe that I named "Canoe Reeves."
$C: Take your upvote and get out
$C: Now say it in Asian. 
$C: while leaving, Keanu Revs
$C: He got all fired up an passed some Keanu weed
$C: it's a bit chilly outside, Keanu Sneezes
$C: Underrated comment
$C: Later that night, Keanu Sleeps.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Anybody else hear his voice when reading that?
$C: This really makes me want a motorcycle
$C: There is nothing that matches the feeling of riding a motorbike without a windshield. The breeze blocks out all sound, you're focused but your mind is free and clear..its definitely Zen. 


$C: Keanu Reeves and the Rock are both in the $250-300 mn networth region, they must be amongst the nicest people globally in that networth bracket. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Canadian? Isn't he hawaiian??
$C: Got into riding at about the same time and I pretty much agree with everything he said.  I put riding on hold until my kid is an adult, the same as what my Dad did, but I do miss it.
$C: I feel everyone at some point in their lives will meet Keanu.  I have.  It was glorious and unforgettable. 
$C: He said all that at the traffic light 

How long were you there???
$C: Keanu is from Toronto? woaaah wtf
$C: "Teach me how to ride it"
$C: Kawasaki... Enduro... beautiful... I miss my KLR. :(
$C: He makes reaaaally expensive motorcycles 
$C: 22 isn't a young adult?...

Fuck.
$C: The girl teaching him to ride sounds straight out of Point Break.
$C: With a f*cking pencil 
$C: I don't know much about bikes but I like that he rides around in a down to earth looking bike. Nothing flashy, surprise they were able to spot him. I don't think i would have spotted him.
$C: The bike he‚Äôs riding - Norton Commando 750 - My Dad has his in pieces in his shed. Been there for 30ish years now. His retirement project. 

He‚Äôs been retired for over a decade... 
$C: Only thing I disagree with is that he said most people start when they‚Äôre young. A majority of Harley Davidson riders actually get their first bike (on average) between 40-50 years old. They typically ride for 1-3 years, and then stop riding once they have a close call.

This is why Harley tries to get you to buy a ton of shit you don‚Äôt need.

Source: had to do a lot market research for Harley when they were beginning to develop a dealership in my city 
$C: >this young girl
$C: By the way I ride an Arch motorcycle.
$C: Let‚Äôs see him matrix his way out of a high speed motorcycle accident!
$C: *Someone needs to have a sit down with Hunter S. Thompson.*
$C: Those Arch bikes are freaking beautiful.  Prices start at nearly $80k.  That said, that is for a bike made and fitted for YOU.
$C: Honestly, not a motorcycle guy but have always had old shitty dirtbikes growing up.  He is right about clearing your mind.  Even if it's not on a sexy custom street bike.
$C: I was eating at Nobu in Malibu and saw him and his biker buddies pull into the restaurant. They were all riding custom bikes which I assume were from his company.
$C: And attends motogp races from time to time.
$C: ***WHAAT I DIDN'T KNOW HE'S FROM MY HOMETOWN??!?!***
$C: I'd love to ride with him, he sounds like a great road buddy. 
$C: Wow I 100% relate to everything he said right there maybe that‚Äôs just part of the phase of riding, like growing up
$C: He's Canadian? That explains everything.
$C: duuuude on wanna play keanu in ice hockey... I think I could take him. 
$C: Damn, he's got some good game too. "Hey, girl, teach me how to ride."
$C: >Riding your bike is one of the greatest things you can do to clear your head and just feel the speed and the motion

This is the reason I myself got into motorcycles. I had a motorcycle license before I had a car license (and being in New England where you can only ride 7 or 8 months a year, This seemed silly). 

But, to get out on the road with only your thoughts, the sights, sounds and feeling of freedom helped me get through some dark times. 

I really like that he‚Äôs down to earth about riding (and apparently also everything else in his life)
$C: TIL he and I would probably get along.
$C: Had to double check halfway through and make sure shittymorph wasnt making a comeback.
$C: The immortal has spoken, bask in his knowledge!
$C: They are expensive af though... I mean even more than a Kawasaki Ninja H2R.
$C: Awesome! 
$C: > "He acutally co-owns a bike company called Arch Motorcycle Company."
And yet rides a Norton. 


$C: > ‚ÄúRiding your bike is one of the greatest things you can do to clear your head and just feel the speed and the motion,‚Äù said Reeves.

as a motorcycle rider myself. this is so true.
$C: I have nightmares. Most nights. Never anything fun or sexy. Just horrible things. A couple of nights ago I had a bad one but before I woke up in terror, Keanu came along and soothed me and hugged me and hung out with me until the baddies went away. 
$C: Oh man how many wipeouts did he get?
$C: He also baught Harleys for everyone in the fx crew of the matrix because he thought those were the real heroes of the movie. 
$C: I can't wait to hear more after the break. Mo Rocca is such a good interviewer. 
$C: "Klaatu Barada Nikto"!
$C: For biking quotes, I'll stick with Hunter. 
$C: Yeah, that last part. That's why I avoid motorcycles. Lol

Actually, I'm sure it would be a blast with some training, but drivers are absolute morons. 
$C: I started riding at 22 too. Year and half later it's still a new world for me.
$C: [Arch Motorcycle Company.](https://youtu.be/PoNWU2cox9w)

I‚Äôm not a motorbike fan but these are beautiful. 
$C: I didn't get into bikes until I was 22 or 23. I started on a 2001 Kawasaki Vulcan 500. It really is something else. I found myself taking longer routes to work just so I could ride more. I ended up buying a 2013 Kawasaki Vulcan 900 in 2015. The bigger bike rode better, and looked better too. 

It even survived an accident last year (as did I) and once spring comes I'll be out riding again.
$C: Honestly had no idea who you were talking about when you said Reeves without the Keanu
$C: Funnily enough, he's wearing a t-shirt for Arch in another post that's currently on the front page (r/funny, post about dodging lawsuits)
$C: as a guy recovering from a motorcycle accident i can relate
$C: Every post about Keanu we get that little bit of info. The world should know by now... jesus fuck.
$C: riding bikes is fun, got to drive a harley for a few hours, it was a blast.  but i will never own a bike.  why?  because when you get in an accident with another vehicle you don't win, even if you do everything correctly.
$C: Being a motorcyclist myself, I'd love to go on a ride with him.
$C: I‚Äôm sure he would want to hang out with you too, and not just because he‚Äôs a great guy, but because you‚Äôre great yourself. Have a wonderful day!

Edit: since someone here asked where they could find more people like me, here‚Äôs [my story about the wonderful people who inspired me to start this account.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/7pnc5x/many_will_say_its_fake/dsijj11/?context=3)
$C: I bet even just making small talk he‚Äôd be a really active and engaged listener and make you feel like what you were saying was really interesting.
$C: I dont know what id nerd out on more, his 3 gun skills or that sweet norton.
$C: Keanu, Terry Crews, and Arnold would be Reddit's ideal hangout crew 
$C: He's matured into the real deal.  He's Steve McQueen without trying.  I like that he dates women older than himself.  Twenty years ago--I though got he was a horrid actor, but he has honed his abilities. I wish him nothing but the best!
$C: I feel like Terry Crews or Chris Pratt would show you the time of your life where your cheeks would hurt from laughing.  I feel like Keanu would pay for everything, hold all the doors, ask you a lot of questions about your life and family, where by the end you would genuinely care about him but your cheeks would be fine.
$C: It is not about Keanu being a celebrety, but Keanu being an example every celebrety should follow. From all i read, he is nice, humble, and hangs out with everybody on set equally. Also helps people in need. Damn it would be cool if i would run into Keanu here in germany and he would solve a problem for me just lke that.
$C: Keanu is the man
$C: Seemed like I did, or at least the internet. Keanu Reeves photo been popping up left and right on reddit. Almost feel like his entourage...
$C: Id want him to hang out with my body parts. He's so beautiful and kind. 
$C: If only all celebrities were like him.  
$C: >but I'd definitely want to hang out with Keanu

I know he has stories and is a nice person.

Just wonder if he is a more open person.  If I have to carry the conversation he'd be boring to chill with.

People need to both listen and talk.  He definitely seems like a listener.  I would like both in this relationship Keanu.  Tell me about you being in the Matrix, yes you can hype it up!  Did they have good food on set?
$C: Him and Norman Reedus on a bike tour would be cool
$C: With all the pics I see of Keanu he needs his own subreddit. 
$C: The more I see of Keanu on Reddit, the more I am sure of two things.

The first is that he is either a time traveler, an immortal being, or some kind of temporal anomaly.

And more seriously, the second is that on a scale from one to ten, where a one is literally Hitler and ten is Tom Hanks, he ranks about a 9.5.
$C: I, on the other hand, wish you a mediocre day.
$C: Should not be too difficult. Guy is like the new Bill Murray. He's fucking everywhere.
$C: I feel like he may be one of the best humans to have ever lived.
$C: I'd buy him a beer anytime.
$C: Has Keanu ever done anything lame and uncool? He's always shooting guns with hot women, riding motorcycles and generally looking like a badass.
 
Just once I'd to see him with toilet paper stuck to his boot or something.
$C: Him and Gordon Ramsay. I'm not talking about the possible mild mannered Gordon that sits at home with secret adopted children and watches Gray's Anatomy, I'm talking about Hell's Kitchen/Kitchen Nightmares Gordon Ramsay. I could listen to his shit talking all day. 
$C: I'd hate to hear people yell his name all day though "Keaaaanuuuuu!"
$C: Seriously if I could clone any celebrity to not be famous and hang out with me, it would be Keanu. He's just so fucking cool.
$C: He is at tracks on the west coast all the time!
$C: Keanu just seems like the nicest and most down to earth guy next to Terry Crews.
$C: I'd ask him if he wants to go on a long bicycle ride with me and some buddies.  I can show him plenty of cool spots in the east midlands where we could grab a cup of tea and a bite to eat before riding again.  Maybe go out of Belvoir Castle.  Who knows?  It'd be a blast.  
$C: Friend of mine works in the motorcycle industry and has hung out with Keanu and he verifies he is a real cool guy.  
$C: At lunch right now and was thinking Keanu would probably be the kind a person you would meet at a diner every morning to sit and quietly have coffee with. No talking, just quiet morning. Coming from a guy who hates the morning and I hate coffee just as much, but I would drink the fuck out of some coffee in the morning with Keanu.
$C: A friend of mine does, he's a good guitarist (or is it Johnny Depp?)

$C: I feel like he asked them if they wanted to take a pic real quick...
$C: I‚Äôd smoke beer with him 
$C: Keanu and Bill Murray and I'm set!
$C: And post malone 
$C: Me too, but i'm kinda disappointed in him riding with that half helmet.
$C: I'm sure he wouldn't want to hang out with you, and not just because he‚Äôs an asshole, but because you‚Äôre an asshole yourself. Have a below average day!

Edit: If you're interested in finding more people like me, here‚Äôs [my story about the terrible people who inspire me](https://youtu.be/HrFCEO8h9eEt) 
$C: Keanu's one of those guys that attracts 3-5  dime-pieces at a time. When he picks one chick and rejects the others you have to be quick about jumping the ones that got rejected and storm the beaches
$C: If wonder aimlessly across America, you will eventually come across Bill Murray and Keanu Reeves, it's inevitable, provided that you live long enough.

$C: He'll find you when the time is right
$C: It's getting old. Wanna impress me? Run into Keanu AND Dave Grohl, together, playing in a ball pit or bouncy castle.
$C: The Oracle will tell you when.

$C: My exact thought!
$C: If Reddit pics are to be believed, at this rate, it might be tomorrow around 9:30 AM.
$C: Op has a suspiciously high rate of run in with Keanu. He himself mentions 6 times he's posted Keanu in here. There's something weird about the whole affair. 
$C: Just ride motorcycles and shoot guns and you'll find him.
$C: Maybe he's standing behind you right now!
$C: It's a schooner, not Keanu, you big stupidhead.
$C: Somehow reddit always finds him.
$C: OP didn't meet Keanu Reeves. The account has 10 KR posts within 3 hours. 
$C: He probably has no reason to come to Colorado so I'm fucked.
$C: Man that tilted I adds so much tone to the little voice inside my head. 
$C: g-go outside!
$C: When you leave your room
$C: I met him and Lawrence fishburne while they were shooting John wick 2 in NYC, was a great surprise during a school field trip. 
$C: My time came in a train Station in Paris, of all places, he was buying a ticket to go to the South of France, I was with my then BF bickering about God knows what. In comes Keanu, I could tell from his silhouette it was him, but he looked pretty shaggily clad, save for an extra large designer travel bag, I knew it was him!  I said woo BF hold my things and rushed over and had a little chat with him, he was so friendly and I was so Daft! bless his cotton socks.
$C: Tomorrow! 
$C: live in Los Angeles on the west side.
$C: [deleted]
$C: *the slowest of claps*
$C: Underrated comment of the day.
$C: ... nice.
$C: Then Keanu leaves
$C: I feel like he's pretty good at staying out of trouble, and staying under the radar in general, so he probably doesn't have the resentment of fan interaction that a lot of celebrities learn to have.

It also seems like he spends a lot of time actually doing things he likes to do, and that probably helps a lot.
$C: Bill Murray would be the king, Keanu is the prince.
$C: If someone is already taking your photograph at a traffic stop what is the thing to do? I feel like this is him just dealing with having random people take your photo without always asking. 

I for one would hate this and am assuming this is just his way of dealing with it but maybe he's ok with it, I don't know. 
$C: I think alot of it is he is a genuinely nice guy who thinks of others, and taking a half second to take a pic makes that person's week.  Just his presence cheers people up, and its way cool he is willing to spread it around.
$C: His pose suggests: ‚ÄúI see you taking my picture, you cheeky shit.  Hello!‚Äù
$C: I am The One.
$C: [deleted]
$C: In this case he‚Äôs in front of the Ralphs at Beverly & Doheny. Maybe stake out that corner and see if he reappears!

Edit: /u/biggerx is right; I got overexcited and mentioned the wrong Ralphs. This one's in Studio City. I am ashamed. https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7pnxv2/meeting_keanu_reeves_at_a_traffic_light/dsiut3g/
$C: This picture is at 12842 Ventura Blvd Studio City, CA 91604. You can see the sign for Ralphs behind him.
$C: I need to know as well--I'm not able to locate him on my Pokemon Go either. 
$C: If you're not in LA then the Bradenton/Sarasota Florida area has the next largest concentration of celebs. I see some TV/Movie star or professional athlete every few days. Especially athletes, considering we have probably the world's best sports academies right across the street from my old high school. 
$C: I would've started throwing Friend Balls at him frantically. 
$C: Why no wild Keanu sub?
$C: Catch a Keanu 
$C: Is there a subreddit for this?
$C: When you find him, he gives you a Keanu seed.
$C: Anddd dennnnn, he sudunry reaves
$C: Keanu uses Kung Fu, he knows that.
$C: Crianky! What a beaut!
$C: 'Keanu fan' used handguns 

Its not very effective..
$C: It's not just *a* Norton Commando. It's a '72 with the Combat engine. 

That bike changed the history of motorcycling. It's hugely important and a hell of a bike.
$C: >mr-reeves.com

Huh. That's.. Interesting

Thanks for the source. 
$C: Keanu loves his Nortons. He would have a field day with my dads collection. 
$C: Norton's and Greaves' and Indian's won't do. 

They don't have a soul like a 1952...
$C: If i saw one if these in the street i don't think i'd notice who's riding it
$C: Neat. I made a website for a big Norton refurbisher a few years ago http://coloradonortonworks.com
$C: Can I please tell you that I love your username? Wish i would have come up with it when it was still available three years ago.
$C: Sweet bike.  My dad has one that he got from his late brother.
$C: Holy shit they were making motorcycles 1250 years ago?
$C: Sweet bike.
$C: Isn't this the same bike Shawn Spencer rides? 
$C: The bike looks small for a 750. Or he‚Äôs just really big. 
$C: Can confirm - I have one in pieces somewhere. Well, most of the pieces. Couldn't find a headlight for the thing!
$C: I love the fact he is riding that Norton over one of the Arches.
$C: Is he *really* rolling commando-style though?  Inquiring minds want to know!  
$C: It's the same bike Shawn Spencer owned I think. 
$C: My dad had one of those. Weirdest fucking bike ever: some of the controls are flipped and you need Whitworth tools to work on it.


$C: Yup, it says right there on the side.  
$C: This post led me down the rabbit hole to this, 

https://youtu.be/o0u4M6vppCI

WTF
$C: Pic from [2014](http://mr-reeves.com/keanu-reeves-norton-last-night/)
$C: It is known.
$C: Correction: Keanu Reeves is always *somewhere*. Redditors have just started on a karma train to post random photos of him which is making it seem like people keep just running into him
$C: metoo
$C: Well I reckon it is really fuckin hard to keep being a cool person after you reach certain level of popularity. I mean, imagine trying to do a shopping and being stopped for a photo by random people every 5 minutes. 
$C: He‚Äôs clearly in Studio City
$C: or "Suddenly Keanu!"
$C: I wish Pok√©mon would start tracking Keanu, so I could wonder around LA pretending to search for new Pok√©mon, but really be tracking enlightenment.  
$C: You had me worried there for a split second.
$C: > Made me like him even more.

Me too just reading your comment, lol.
$C: Incidentally, if this was someone reddit didn't like, "he was rude.  Went to the photo op and took pictures because I guess he had to, and all he did was answer questions with like a yes or no.  Really grumpy guy."
$C: I went to their concert in Sydney for the same reason thousands of other women were there.  I was up the back of the venue and it was kind of hilarious to look down and 90% of the audience was squished way over to his side of the stage.

The big surprise was that they were quite good!  So good I even forgot to stop swooning over him for most of the concert.  Hashtag, NoRagrets. 
$C: The everyone in the world is his friend, he‚Äôs just trying to spend equal time with everyone 
$C: [even around other celebrities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg2vYqjERnE)
$C: That Norton is a firebreather.

Not much physically bigger than a RD350, handles like it's on rails, and goes like stink.



One of the original Superbikes.
$C: Norton Commandos are fun to ride. I've been wanting to buy one for a few years now. 
$C: Riding  claasic from the '70's is an amazing experience. I have 2 dual sports(1977) and a converted cafe racer(1972). You have to experience them to understand.
$C: OH MY GOD ITS NOT EVEN LIKE THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE SO HAPPY TOGETHER AND HAVE A HOUSE WHERE HE CAN WORK ON HIS BIKES WHILE I MAKE LUNCH AND BRIMG HIM LEMONADE AND HAVE FIVE CHILDREN NAMED TIFFANY SARAH JACOB BRENDAN AND MICHEAL!!!!!!
$C: Me too thanks
$C: He said he wasn't sad, he was just enjoying lunch.
$C: Life is like a box of choc-lates
$C: I dont get it :/
$C: That‚Äôd be rad
$C: Nah, I haven't met him either.
$C: That was my guess!  I always referred to that as the "Celebrity Ralphs."  In that store I've seen, among others, Samuel L. Jackson, Penelope Cruz, and Eddie Van Halen.
$C: Definitely is. I‚Äôve seen Shaq there!
$C: Ayyy! 818!
$C: Came here to say this, too. haha.
$C: If he kept going west he could have ended up at my BJJ gym in about 2 miles.
$C: Came here for this. 
$C: I agree
$C: Wow this is our route when my boss visits his dad Kirk Douglas.
$C: Yep. Street sign appears to read "Ventura Blvd"
$C: I was going to say Beverly and Doheny, but with the Hill in the background, I think you‚Äôre right. 
$C: This guy stalks...
 
...or lives/works near Studio City.
$C: That bike is... pornographic. 
$C: weird 
$C: When he starred in Dracula and was getting grey hair that was actually him getting weak. He hadn't done his vampire thing in a while and it showed
$C: Woah
$C: He doesn't make friends anymore. It'll just be too much heartbreak every time you survive them. Friendship is so fleeting when you're several centuries old.
$C: I volunteer to be his new BFF
$C: Right by my favorite Ralph‚Äôs 
$C: [deleted]
$C: I mean, he's looking better with age too. I look forward to the future. 
$C: Wanna go camping??
$C: There may be a bit of a bend in there bud.
$C: Its a pretty standard photo... white knight cuckboy
$C: dont replace our /r/onetruegod

jk that movie was shit. 
$C: Coincidentally Neil Peart (of the Canadian band Rush) wrote a book titled *Ghost Rider* about [his motorcycle trip across the U.S. to cope with the death of first his daughter and then his wife.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Rider:_Travels_on_the_Healing_Road)
$C: This. Danny Ketch, 90s Ghost Rider. 
$C: "That's a cool picture I just found of you online, I should post it on Reddit."
$C: President of the world.
$C: Everyone has been saying this is in California, where it‚Äôs the law to wear one. 
$C: It's the typical reddit circlejerk.
$C: I did not, but I do now. That's awesome. It's called [Arch Motorcycle](https://www.archmotorcycle.com/) it seems.
$C: He's just known to be a cool guy who's nice to fans when he meets them. He's also had some tragedy in his life that would make some people bitter.
$C: It sucks here in texas, if I knew any better I wouldn't be here either :( unfortunately born and raised here ugh 
$C: Because he is the one.
$C: My brother had a Triumph. Pain in the ass to get started. 
Watching him suffer infinitely kicking in the hot sun while my Honda XR500 fired up 1st kick was rather sad. 

Like the style though for sure. But no fun if it doesn't start.

Rather have this today:

[https://www.motoroids.com/news/intermot-2016-meet-the-2017-honda-cb1100-rs-and-cb1100-ex/]


$C: R/WildKeanuAppears
$C: Yeah, he's a pretty excellent human being for being a celebrity.
$C: Part of his humble nature stems from the kinda fucked up life he's lived. He's had to deal with some seriously heavy shit over the course of his successful career. If you appreciate Keanu, you should read up on what the man has been thru, it makes you appreciate him that much more.
$C: r/KeanuReeves
$C: he actually owes a boutique motorcycle manufacturer: ARCH they‚Äôre racing bike bodies with huuuuuge Vtwin american style engines. Utah is a total gear head! 
$C: Boner is confused!

It hurts itself in its confusion!
$C: 2/10 didn‚Äôt keep it classy long enough before changing tone, language gave away the ‚Äútwist‚Äù 
$C: I need a cigarette. 
$C: Obligatory wtf did I just read?
$C: r/hmmm
$C: What
$C: please never go back on the internet or anywhere in public. 
$C: PR team on point 
$C: John Wick 3?
$C: Probably because he is one of the few male leads who hasn't been credibly accused of sexual misconduct lately. 
$C: I've wondered that too, but... this is the guy who was recorded on a subway offering his seat to a fellow passenger.  

Keanu is just being Keanu. And apparently, that includes being out & about like a regular Joe. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59FUFg2sP7c
$C: And lotsa  money.
$C: Dude has great taste in bikes.
$C: What!?
$C: I'd vote for him.
$C: Now, now, it's not like he's Verne Troyer or anything.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I dunno. Probably LA.
$C: Yeah I'm surprised he's not on one of his companies bikes.  Unless this is actually an older pic.
$C: Yeah, this shit is crazy. Anything remotely Keanu = front page material.
$C: His life has been tragic but he never fails to smile.  High regards for him.
$C: God I hope so...
$C: Neo: What are you trying to tell me? That I can dodge downvotes?

Morpheus: No, Neo. I‚Äôm trying to tell you that when you‚Äôre ready, you won‚Äôt have to.
$C: He is liked because he is well known to be a decent dude IRL.
$C: lolololol
$C: He‚Äôs Canadian
$C: I've been noticing this for several days. It seems too artificial. I'll stand by your side /u/GeneralPatten.
$C: He isn't even riding one of his motorcycles, so your theory goes out the window. That's how he prefers to get around and there are a whole lot of people in LA that love him. 

Not sure why you have two edits about "rustling the hornet's nest" when you have only 2 comments responding to you. Relax, we just love Keanu
$C: I think you've got that tinfoil a little too tight.
$C: This iced what happens when you Reddit too much guys, take it as a warning.
$C: You seem like a person who i would laugh at
$C: I know. I think he's more careful now. The accident that took his spleen was because he was riding in the canyon at night with no headlights. This was in the late 80's
$C: Wearing jeans as well :S
$C: Not sure, but i find myself wanting to see them, and missing them when they stop!
$C: Because he‚Äôs the best.
$C: Apparently he just appreciates the classics.
$C: Original 
$C: Not ridden one myself but know people who have them. The new ones are pretty amazing from what I hear.
$C: turn that frown upside down...
$C: Nothing special about it. Norton is an old brand like Harley. 
$C: ... Understandably.
$C: It's very similar. They are both Norton Commandos. The director of the movie (private idaho btw) has the bike from the movie.
$C: Dude's had some shit happen in life. For him to be constant chill is amazing. I too would buy him a beer, be his friend, and not ask dumb fanboy questions.
$C: My guess is there a movie being released or something.  This is the new marketing.
$C: I have not met him either. Yet.
$C: Small price to pay for being rich. That being sad, Keanu reeves is very down to earth, giving money away, helping people and genuinely seems like a nice person who doesn't let fame rise to his head.
$C: We already did it!  r/KeanuBeingAwesome
$C: Your father
$C: It seems like there should be!!
$C: People just love him. He's gone through a LOT of shit in his life, but he's still just a simple, nice guy. 

(If you don't know his background, look it up. Holy shit, even Lemony Sniket would say that's overkill)
$C: You. Door. Figure the connection. 
$C: No, it‚Äôs a dam motorcyclist. 
$C: the real question is why isn‚Äôt EVERYONE in love with Keanu?
$C: So, I'm a straight man and can admit he's hot. Its the Damn truth!
$C: Um sorry 4yo got ahold of my phone 
$C: Those are clearly denim jeans, not  khakis.
$C: Do you know the 'sad keanu' and 'ageless keanu' memes?
$C: Key-ah-nu is how I‚Äôve always said it 
$C: I think it's just because he's leaning forward, so his head looks bigger than it should compared to his body.
$C: We need a WheresReeves.com lol or maybe r/wheresreeves
$C: Acknowledging your very existence is good enough.
$C: There should be . .along with GPS mapping
$C: You should check out him and his buddies motorcycle company. They make some pretty slick looking bikes.
$C: What's ATGATT?
$C: Dwayne Johnson is a gimmick character, not a serious actor.

If Keanu Reeves values his career, he wouldn‚Äôt even consider taking a role with Dwayne Johnson.
$C: 1 1mth ago bitcoin?
$C: Well he does own quite a few classic Norton bikes and you don‚Äôt see them very often so I would say it‚Äôs probably a real photo.
$C: I haven't met him...LOL
$C: Ok, maybe I'd be gay for those three guys, but that's it.
$C: nevermind those palm trees in the background. 
$C: Naw, Keanu is co-founder of a motorcycle company out in Southern California. Dude must have a boatload of sexy bikes.
$C: My wife had a cat named Keanu as a child (named after the actor).  This was over 2 decades ago though.  
$C: Keanu Week is the next Shark Week.
$C: Are you sure? I mean, he never ages.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Commando 
$C: He overall just seems like a really good dude. Hard not to like him, so this happens. 
$C: Mostly because he is just a plain ol stand up guy. 

Worth 300 million making ‚Äúok‚Äù movies by being ridiculed for his abilities, but he takes it with humility. 

He loves the ‚Äúanti‚Äù Hollywood life and has avoided the typical scandal that besets someone of his fame. 
$C: Thanks?
$C: I thought it was Michael Stevens from Vsauce.
$C: Keanu is Spider-Man Confirmed. 
$C: Should be a subreddit called 365Keanu where each day someone posts a picture of Keanu when they meet him. Pretty sure we would cover the whole year. 
$C: He‚Äôs photogenic?
$C: The Ralph's sign is a dead giveaway.  
$C: He is the one!
$C: Do you think the people who work at McDonalds only eat at McDonalds?
$C: Good bot
$C: I‚Äôve lost people on bicycles, on motorbikes, in cars, on buses and someone falling and hitting their head in their living room.  

Death sucks. It is a part of life though. If I were affected that way, I‚Äôd never leave my bed or talk to anyone.  

Statistically, the people that die on motorbikes have some level of contribution to their demise. Be it riding drunk, not observing and reacting to what is happening around them, riding outside the limits of the law or even road conditions, not wearing a full face helmet, not wearing the right protection, not riding in a way to make them more noticeable to other road users or in a way to take advantage of the road, not taking advantage of all the rider aids they might have at their disposal, not keeping their bike maintained.  

I‚Äôd suggest you find a way to get over this. Talk to a grief counselor, as that isn‚Äôt a healthy response. Take the MSF Basic RiderCourse. Even if you have no intention of riding a motorcycle, it will help you understand what safety precautions motorcyclists can take advantage of and will help you as a car driver. 
$C: Born in the Carolinas! Drinking it now lol
$C: Photos of Keanu in public places has been a thing for many years. It's because he's accessible, in public a lot, and not paparazzi'd to hell. And from what people who meet him say, he's a nice person.
$C: He was a "thing" since John Wick came out, I think.
$C: Ventura Blvd in studio city 
$C: Was just going to ask the same thing. It seems like marketing.
$C: Reddit jumps from person to person and obsesses over them.

Once the circlejerk gets started, it could go on for months or years. They say Reddit is mostly full of males but all I encounter are fangirls.
$C: He's a celebrity who isn't a dick to his fans and, to my knowledge, hasn't touched anyone inappropriately. 
$C: Restored vintage bikes like that ain't cheap either.
$C: ...everything is dangerous when you think about it. 
$C: It's called a helmet.
$C: You mean greatest actor of a generation bruh!
$C: Yea, not even close.  Theres a 1972 Norton Commando on CycleTrader for $9.5k.  Or you could just buy a new one for $16k.  Also, Arch motorcycles are specifically made for the clientele that can afford them.  They aren't marketing them to the everyday rider.  Do you also get mad that not everyone is driving Maserati
$C: Um no actually. 
$C: Lol no, and btw the man has been working his ass off since he was 15 years old. Jealousy looks good on no one. 

$C: Bullshit
$C: proof....?
$C: I'm sorry for your loss
$C: So? No one can ride one because your friend died?
$C: People die in cars everyday. 
$C: Keanu Reeves, Terry Crews, Dave Grohl, Bob Ross, Tom Hanks.

I've only heard good things about them.
$C: terry crews, keanu reeves, dylan, dylan, dylan

edit: it seems the dylan joke went unnoticed by some.

I think our top 5 is terry crews, keanu reeves, the governator, and then bill murray/nick cage

dont @ me
$C: Lmao, remember when Jennifer Lawrence was Reddit's golden girl? 
$C: [deleted]
$C: /u/govSchwarzenegger
$C: on the other hand...Ajit Pai is the most hated.
$C: Snoop would be up there
$C: Bill fucking Murray
$C: Definitely Gordon Ramsay, dude's on his 4th AmA and they're all hits.
$C: Brendan Fraser is definitely Top 5
$C: Verne Troyer or Peter Mayhew?
$C: Lest we forget /u/officialvalkilmer 

$C: Patrick Stewart for one
$C: Prison Mike fo'sho
$C: I could see dave grohl being there
$C: Reddit loves Val Kilmer and his great AMA's (official ones and spontaneous ones). And with good reason; he gives detailed, thoughtful answers, like he actually gives a shit, which is pretty cool. 
$C: Top 5 are like Keanu Reeves, Elon Musk, Terry Crews, Bill Gates and Bill Nye. Oh and Bob Ross and Fred Rogers but they‚Äôre legendary tier. 
$C: Terry, Keanu, Arnold Sw, Tom Hanks, Snoop Dogg.
$C: Also, Bill Gates and The Rock.
$C: Tom Hanks has to be on there.  He's top-5 favorite of everyone.
$C: Danny DeVito
Peter Mayhew 

$C: Sean Bean
$C: Adam Savage
$C: Elon Musk
$C: Bill Nye

Weird Al
$C: Bob Ross is on the list
$C: As well as Logan Paul.
$C: Ajit Pai, Martin Shkreli, Logan Paul, Harvey Weinstein, the woman who returned her dead Christmas tree to Costco
$C: David Hyde pierce, Leo DiCaprio 
$C: /u/PeterMayhew
$C: How about Mr. Rogers?
$C: Weird Al Yankovic
$C: I wouldn't. If he's one of Reddit's top five, why have I never heard the name before?
$C: Peter Mayhew and Arnold Schwarzenegger are two celebrities who I have witnessed being so incredibly amazing. They are stand up individuals whose kindnesses have touched me.

While I have never seen a Keanu Reeves post on reddit, he has such kind eyes. The only other celebrity whose heart shows in his eyes is Peter Mayhew. 

I apologize for signaling you out, Mr. Schwarzenegger, if you should ever read this. Your exquisite skill as a Terminator in your past life has left behind an indescribable glint in your eye. ;)

I have to wonder if these three have ever met. I am really curious on what types of topics would come up during casual conversation between the three... 
$C: Ajit pai
$C: Terry Crews is a regular at the theatre I used to work at. He was such a wholesome, kind guy, as is his whole family. I always got a kick whenever they visited.
$C: Ewan Mcgregor has to be on there somewhere 
$C: Terry Crews, Keanu Reeves, Neil Degrasae-Tyson, Bill Nye or Bob Ross
$C: Terry Cruz, Snoop Dogg, Keanu Reaves, Arnold Schwarzernegger, and bill gates/Tesla man
$C: Verne Troyer as well
$C: Keanu Reeves, Terry Crews, Tom Hanks, Arnold, and Val Kilmer. 

All those guys you can meet on the street, and as long as you aren't an asshole to them, are pretty cool people.

For my favorite Rob Schneider is for sure one of the nicest people you will meet in real life. Gary Sinise is pretty nice too in person. R. Lee Ermy is usually cool too.
$C: Logan Paul?
$C: Why the sarcasm? You'd probably pick Keanu over Trump. Along with most people
$C: Were they like super hot women or something?
$C: [deleted]
$C: Probably went something like [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=t2FMSnl8qOY)
$C: Just imagining pulling up to a light and having someone look at you like that unprompted...
$C: That's because they probably said, "Keanu! Hey, Keanu, look over here! Pleeeeze! Keanu!"
$C: You idiot he's looking at him bcuz he's taking the picture you are so stupid
$C: Naw man he's posing when they asked him if they could take a picture.. because he's just a cool guy... He doesn't show any annoyance towards his fans ...the epitome of a good celebrity...
$C: Already posed for the picture.  
$C: Every traffic light. Every time. Every person. 
$C: ‚ÄúHoney, don‚Äôt too quickly, but.......is that Keannu Reeves the next lane over looking he wants to murder us...?‚Äù 

It honestly doesn‚Äôt seem out of character to imagine him bouncing around all over the place just sticking his face in other people‚Äôs business. I mean what more fun thing would there be to do if you‚Äôre famous?
$C:  "Oh shit dude! Ya know that 'raccoon or possum' we hit a few miles back?"

"Dude quit bringing down the mood, it was an accident!"

"Dude i think it might have been a dog..."

"Man, why would you go and say something like that..."

"Because fuckin John Wick is outside your window staring us down!"
$C: Plot twist, it was Ed Sheeren in the car
$C: Plot twist.  OP is Keanu and post his own photos for karma.
$C: He just created r/KeanuBeingAwesome
$C: Or OP is just a blatant Karma whore riding on that virtual Keanu dick to get that sweet sweet Karma juice in and around his mouth
$C: As of right now he has 10 Keanu posts.

All within 3 hours. 
$C: ...and asked OP to stop *stalking* him...
$C: What if we're supporting a stalker?
$C: What about the blessing part?
$C: He tells people he isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe One‚Äù when that happens right?
$C: Not very efficient, though
$C: Shit, you have time to watch 6 movies today? Color me jealous.

Unless it's due to a disability or something really tragic, in which case I apologize and hope you enjoy your movies.

Well, I hope you enjoy them either way.
$C: wait till you find out about our "secret" signal. 
$C: Found Keanu's bodyguard.
$C: Yeah, um, you need to stop stalking Keanu.
$C: So did you actually see him at the traffic light?
$C: There should be a subreddit for this, like /r/KeanuInTheWild or /r/KeanuSpotting or something.
$C: You know what? Fuck it, I'll sub. I like seeing people see this person.
$C: [This is necessary viewing.](https://i.imgur.com/qXaoDxI.gifv)
$C: Why do you keep making posts about pictures of him?  That‚Äôs rly weird
$C: I like how you can see the first custom-made motorcycle in the second photo.

"Hey, Keanu! Sit on this bike so I can get a cool pic!..... Ok, great! Go sit on that one too!"
$C: What Los Angeles intersection was he at?! I love this man.
$C: He's the Patron Saint of Reddit.
$C: Outstanding!! I love Keanu so much. All this Keanu on Reddit is awesome, and this is my new favourite sub. 

I even have a Keanu themed bar in my shed.
$C: Is that why you‚Äôre practically stalking him?
$C: You obsessed with him?
$C: Do we have a sub dedicated to Keanu? 
$C: Don't forget his [double hand hover!](https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/7opert/so_youre_telling_me_i_can_dodge_lawsuits_no_neo/)


$C: Maybe dreams can come true! Where are you Keanuuuuuuu
$C: He's seriously one of my favorite people ever. The only 2 celebrities I can think of who I would really love to hang out with is him and Tom Hanks.
$C: r/keanugifs
$C: damn those are some sexy bikes.
$C: !redditSilver
$C: Haha I didn't even realize and made a sub too: /r/ISeeUKeanu
$C: /r/lordkeanu 
$C: Username checks out
$C: Gay for K.  Not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with that.
$C: Thanks! Subscribed! üòÉ
$C: Instantly subscribed! He's classy af
$C: Man the pressure on the poor guy. If past cases are anything to go by, he'll slip up like a human just once and then get a slew of disappointed hate online. Which he wouldn't get if he hadn't built a rep for being awesome...
$C: That motorcycle stuff is cool.

You know, the problem with cruisers/choppers is there's no elegance or self-control. Mostly they are garish, obnoxious, inefficient, ugly, over-compensating.../r/ATBGE stuff. 

It says a lot about Keanu where he can make...I dunno, a 2.0L V-Twin cafe racer and me not go "YOU RUINED THE ENTIRE POINT" and say "wow, he took what he liked and made it bigger and it works."

Although it's funny to see him on such a small bike.
$C: Subscribed thanks. 
$C: How'd you even recognize him in traffic? Did you recognize the bike or something?
$C: He really is a fucking awesome guy
$C: He is the Tom Hanks of his generation.
$C: This man is a fucking legend
$C: Keanu has good taste in motorcycles, they look great.
$C: He seems like a legit cool head observer
$C: I love him too.
$C: Everytime I see him show up on Reddit, I‚Äôm convinced more and more that he‚Äôs a national treasure. #KeanuReeves4President 
$C: I'm in!
$C: Someone else in this thread said ‚Äúa wild Keanu appears‚Äù I like that as a subreddit title way more. But good on ya either way! 
$C: That's rookie numbers !!! Moar pls
$C: Thank you. This is all the Reddit I need. 
$C: Subbed for sure 
$C: What a gentleman and a scholar
$C: He's just an all round nice guy! People look at "celebrities" like the kardashians and Justin bieber as role models, they are so manufactured! If the whole world was like Keanu, it would be a much better place! 
$C: yes! thanks for making that sub. i'll follow him to the ends of the earth. 
$C: My god...the Karma levels. This can't be! My scouter must be malfunctioning!
$C: Subbed.
$C: Who's actually checking out the motorcycles?
$C: Man those bikes of his are rad as hell. 
$C: You just harvested so much karma man holy crap
$C: Stop stalking him.
$C: He's a good role model
$C: He's twice as old as me. I want to use my next 26 years trying to be more like him.
$C: Thank you - subbed.! 
$C: Subscribed!
Shouldn‚Äôt it really be r/Keanubeingexcellent though?
$C: Well that blew up. r/CrewsCrew 2.0
$C: Should've taken over /r/mostexcellent
$C: at this point if you don't love Keanu Reeves then fuck you
$C: Keanu is by far one of the best Hollywood actors.  I think he can level with just about anybody with the movies he plays in.  Plus the stories of everything he went through and how humble he is, you can not help but like the man.  He has deffinetly risen to become one of my top favorite actors.
$C: OP is Keanu‚Äôs stalker. Get a restraining order against OP Keanu. ü§™
$C: 8 hours and it already has over 13,000 people sub'd!
$C: Holy hell that new sub got a lot of activity in the past 8 hours lol
$C: I met him once years ago at the NAMM show in california around 2000 and he was a major asshole. I tried to just say hi and take a picture with him and he told me off. Mind you I can understand because in this huge arena I'm sure he was sick of Matrix fanboys like myself coming up to him for a photo. 
$C: same.
$C: Commenting on history
$C: One of my best childhood "heroes", certanly inspired me to explore the Matrix and eventually end up doing CS.
$C: He is one of the greats. I wish he was my dad.
$C: Are you and him semi-close through all these meetings?
$C: Well... I subscribed the fuck up üí™
$C: Nice try Keanu
$C: Well played Keanu
$C: Now kiss
$C: Came here just to see if there was a Keanu sub. 
Was not disappointed. Thank you kind stranger. 
$C: You have made my day.
$C: Holy fuck, that third picture (the custom made bike), straight guy here but I would definitely turn gay for him. 

He definitely is showing his age in that pic though...25. 
$C: Why make such a big deal out of it? There are millions of ordinary people who do good things all the time, some do even better things. I know reddit is full of pathetic sycophants but at least have some self reflection. 
$C: And you, unknown human, now have a new subscriber. Thanks you. 

$C: Subscribed.
$C: We all need to get together and get him a gift.
$C: Subbed.
$C: Subbed
$C: Jesus you‚Äôre about to crack 5000 subscribers and only three hours!?! Great job! Subscribed!
$C: [a recent great one](https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/7opert/so_youre_telling_me_i_can_dodge_lawsuits_no_neo/?st=JCALAT5J&sh=0492fc86) 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Really hope Reddit doesn't turn on him.  Seems to always go in a cycle - "We love ______", "_______ is arrogant/a jerk/etc".
$C: Little rag217, your mom and I want to talk to you about Keanu.  Keanu loves you very much, but he had to go live on a farm.  The farm is very far from here, and we won‚Äôt be able to visit.  Keanu‚Äôs very happy on the farm, he has another Keanu to play with, and lots of chickens to chase around a pond.  Also, we got you a puppy.  
$C: For me it was this post that made it a thing. It‚Äôs now part of my life, I‚Äôve accepted it. Hell I didn‚Äôt  really like the guy until now. K should stay. 

EDIT:And the site should be changed to Kreddit.com
$C: a feature imo
$C: Yeah there's some random picture of him posted nearly every day it seems
$C: Next thing you know, somebody's saying he should be president...
$C: I would believe that for literally any other celebrity. 
$C: To be fair, he's also an extremely nice and relatable guy for a celebrity and it's a nice change from all the celebrity sex abuse scandals. 
$C: Is there a new movie of his coming out soon?
$C: Along with the rock and Kevin hart promoting jumanji
$C: You must not live in L.A., where if you hang out in a few spots you're likely to spot at least a celebrity a day.
$C: As if he needs one...
$C: I looked at his IMDB and his has a couple movies this year.  Not sure if it would be for those though.
$C: Probably so
$C: Yep. But I didn't realize it was an ad for a good minute or so, being such a cool pic, so B+ for execution. They breached the safe for over a minute and did untold subconscious rewiring. 

*sips coffee*

*"Gee, I kinda miss Keanu now. I wonder if he's gonna be in a movie soon?"*
$C: /r/neo is that way
$C: /r/lordkeanu exists in opposition to /r/onetruegod for the real immortal 
$C: Well he did let that sweet little puppy get murdered...
$C: I guess I missed the hate train for her, what's the reason and is there still room on board? 
$C: turn that frown upside down...
$C: To his dog from John Wick Keanu grieves
$C: And takes off his Keanu Greaves 
$C: To play the Pianu Keys
$C: And smokes some Keanu Leaves
$C: He inhales deeply, Keanu Breaths
$C: After he gets his newspaper from his buttler, Keanu Geeves
$C: And gets ready to chop some Keanu Trees
$C: !redditsilver 
$C: Keanu not. 
$C: He seems like a truly nice person. No Beeves with anyone. 
$C: After which he Keanu Pees.
$C: Haunted by his good bro Keanu Peeves
$C: Where he is greeted by his butler Keanu Jeeves
$C: Where he relaxes and Keanu breathes.
$C: Get out the ladder to clean out his Keanu Eaves
$C: He has a butler to do that. Geeves. 
$C: Smells really bad, Keanu jeez
$C: Wife dies. Dog killed. Keanu bereaves. 
$C: And uses his favorite search engine, Keanu Ask Jeeves.
$C: A beer from the fridge Keanu retrieves
$C: [deleted]
$C: He cooks is dinner in silence, Keanu Beans
$C: He sets the kettle , boiling water for his Keanu Tea
$C: Where does Keanu keep his armies? In his sleevies! üòÅ
Edit: Aw come on! That‚Äôs funny! Okay, how about: ‚ÄúWhere does GENERAL Keanu keep his armies?‚Äù Is that better?! Y‚Äôall need to lighten up! üòÜ
$C: after leaving court for his crimes of passion, he pays his Keanu Fees.
$C: Wearing his heart, on his Keanu sleeves
$C: Is there a movie where Keanu a child conceives?
$C: Keanu turns on the radio, blasting justin Beebs
$C: /r/ISeeUKeanu
$C: Oh man. I love these Reddit chain stories. Upvotes get you the best story ever. Can we try writing a book this way? Will still be better than the Twilight series
$C: When he got home he smoked Keanu trees...
$C: and then keanu looks up and he believes

$C: Trust me, I don't need it. My gold won't run out until March 2024
$C: I think he is plenty satisfied with the number of fake Internet points he got. 
$C: I guess it depends. I had someone here ranting about how puns are ruining reddit and I'm not funny or clever at all.
$C: *he earns his Keanu degrees
$C: !redditgarlic
$C: I'm paying the price in inbox replies
$C: does gdk stand for god damn keanu?
$C: hey Brad
$C: I honestly can't believe how many comments spun off from this. Even Keanu Disbelieves.
$C: I hope he protects his legs with some Keanu Greaves
$C: >Everyone who upvotes or comments stupid puns like these ruins Reddit for anyone interested in regular intellectual humor, or conversation.

I think you're missing the point that the main demographic of reddit likes that material, otherwise it wouldn't get upvotes. I'm sorry you aren't getting enough intellectual humor/conversation in a sub of 18 million people
$C: Whoa
$C: I said whoa in his voice when he mentioned the crashes.
$C: I‚Äôm reading and imagining him yelling at me all of this while stopped at that traffic light. 

It‚Äôs a long traffic light. 

That, or he speaks really fast. 
$C: we all do
$C: I didn‚Äôt realize I had done it until I read your comment but I absolutely did
$C: I thought I read it in my voice until I read your comment. Then I realized the voice in my head is Keanu. 
$C: No
$C: Anybody else recall "The Matrix" when reading any post about Reeves?
$C: Point Break Keanu forever.
$C: i...how
$C: Yeah, and it was amazing. Heard it in his Neo voice. 
$C: Yep! Ive seen waaaay to many of his movies growing up üòÇ
$C: Yes but until the laughter bit, why can't I imagine him laughing !?! 
$C: yep, just like how he described his parents "death" to surfer lady in point break.
$C: It's almost like your brain does that automatically when you know who said quoted text. How are people still blown away by this? 
$C: I read it in morgan freeman's voice
$C: The ox knows its owner,
and the ass its master's crib;
but Israel does not know,
my people does not understand.

Isaiah 1:3
$C: My Keanu voice is pretty much the same as my Steven Seagal voice. 
$C: lol YES!
$C: Almost as if he said it
$C: Wow, it's a glitch in the matrix.
$C: Is Keanu your daddy reading Reddit comments to you? Because no I did not. 
$C: Yup. Love that bike also
$C: No, I read it in Peter Griffins voice
$C: It really is fantastic. It keeps you totally in the moment as it requires all of your mind paying attention. So everything else just kinda melts away except for you and the bike. 
$C: Take the motorcycle safety course near you. They often have bikes to use. It's required where I am, and as soon as you start moving, you'll know if you want to go get one right this second or it isn't for you. 

Plus it gives you confidence that you know the basics.
$C: The crashing part is enough to deter me 
$C: As soon as I saw this picture I thought that this will have the same effect on youngsters the way seeing Steve McQueen on a bike affected me.  I bought one and have been riding ever since- nearly 35 years!  Start small and work your way up. You'll never regret it!
  
$C: Like Keanu I waited until later in life. I have always been a lover of speed so I avoided motorcycles especially with my family history- Right before I was born my dad crashed on his BMW and nearly died braking 9 bones. Anyway I waited until I was 40, and I fixed up my Dad's old bike that he never repaired or put back on the road again, my entire life. I restored the bike and now as a father of two myself, I ride for the freedom, knowing the risks and being careful. I am glad I waited this long. 
$C: Get one.  It puts you on the edge of experiencing the world around you.  
$C: Dude, right? I was like "I, too, sometimes feel frustrated and angry..." Seems like a pretty cathartic release. 
$C: Do it, it's one of the greatest things I decided to get into. Few things in life are as freeing as you and your bike on a open/windey road.

Trust me, you won't regret it. Just remember though, a passive rider is an alive rider.

Hope to see ya out there one day!
$C: Nothing quite as appealing as the phrase, "ruptured spleen."
$C: Take the msf course! It is a training course that teaches you you the basics of riding and it acts as the riding test to attain your license. Motorcycles and helmets are provided, so you don't need to worry about damaging anything, because its not yours. Prices can range 50$-250$ depending on the state you are in. And since you don't go over 20mph, it is a very good way to get the experience without doing anything too dangerous or making a huge commitment.
$C: I started riding at 30. Man, do I love it. Haven't in almost two years because life, but I'm currently working at getting my Z1000 road-ready again. Can't wait for the spring.
$C: It requires 100% of your concentration at all times, so as long as it's not your primary mode of transportation you'd probably enjoy it.
$C: Just remember that everyone you see at Walmart has your life in their hands while you are on one.
$C: I want one too... wanna share one?
$C: Yea, until just about everyone on the road you encounter tries to kill you.  (Been a rider for 28 years, seriously considering hanging it up.  My CB600F waits for me in the garage, but the combo of cell phones and SUV's, man...that's some bad mojo for riders.)
$C: don't. shit is too dangerous. not worth it imo. 

source: almost died on motorcycle. I can only be grateful that I'm a huge gear whore and was decked out in super expensive riding protective gear.

that said.. adderall + motorcycle + good earbuds + Odesza = best feeling ever
$C: Hopefully not the, "I used to get out on the road with the bike and just go as fast as I could and basically let it all out on the road", part.

By my office, there are three crosses on the side street, all of which are motorcycle deaths. Its a long street with light traffic, so kids come by on their bikes and punch it. We heard one of them smack into the side of a work van, dead on impact.
$C: It's an intense experience to know that death can come for you at any angle, and from the smallest of mistakes. 

Hit a pothole on a sweeping corner and you go down, slide into a gaurd rail and you're dead. 

Look down at your speed for a second and a person on snapchat is sending you into a highway divider. 

But even with that in mind you are focusing so much the rest of the world goes away. It's just you, the power of your machine, the wind, the speed, and trying to stay alive in a sea of morons.
$C: Reread the spleen bit.
$C: only thing I've experienced that's even close to the thrill of riding a motorcycle is having sex
$C: If you want to feel what it's like to strap yourself to a rocket then go for it. But please work your way up. Don't go out and buy a superbike and kill yourself. I think bikes get their bad reputation partly because, unlike cars, people can actually afford to buy the fastest bikes in existence. You could pick up a Yamaha R1 for less than a normal family car. But a lower barrier to entry means more idiots riding beyond their limits.
$C: Keanu is dead on.....he describes it perfectly.

Riding a motorcycle is the closest thing to freedom + therapy + white knuckle thrills you can experience. 

I miss it every day.
$C: UNLESS- it's through Wyoming on the Interstate at 80 MPH in July heat.  Then a windshield/ fairing will be greatly appreciated!
$C: Like this guy?  
https://youtu.be/_fQwwvb7CRc
$C: And the art of motorcycle maintenance
$C: my my, i must reached nirvana by now then. we, from S.E.A ride motorbike without windshield at all
$C: .. and the bugs!.. all your daily vitamins and nutrition requirements all under 5 min.!
$C: Until you're in hour 8 of day 4, and you're moving at 80 ! Then, the shield helps. 
$C: What a great book that was.
$C: Shane Macgowan up there as well, I'd say.
$C: I definitely would 
$C: He has Hawaiian ancestry but he was raised in Canada.
$C: Smart move. Very wise
$C: turn that frown upside down...
$C: being a motorcycle id let him ride me long and hard! also, vroom vroom!!!! (which means ‚Äúhave a great day. it‚Äôs almost the weekend, woo!‚Äù)
$C: I would totally ride him. 
$C: Touring with Keanu and Ewan McGregor would the the coolest.
$C: ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
$C: That's what she said....
$C: Not to mention he's on my favorite bike... a Norton Commando. 
$C: Him, dave chappelle, and the stig
$C: I couldn't go on a motorcycle ride with keanu because I would be embarrassed when my erection pokes him in the . I swear it's just the vibrations.
$C: Anybody with an old Norton is probably cool to hang out with.
$C: Being a pedestrian, I'd happily let him run me over. 
$C: Why? you can't do stuff while you ride might aswell follow any other guy
$C: Like on the back? 
$C: > Being a motorcyclist myself, I'd love to go on a ride with him.

I imagined you using Keanu Reeves as a motorcycle.
$C: I'd let him have a reach around tbh, he seems like a gent
$C: Me too, the same motorcycle though.
$C: He's right at the top of the list of famous people I think it would be cool to ride with / talk bikes with. 
$C: I've always wanted to ask him to go halvsies on a couple boxes of ammo and hit the shooting range for a day. One day I will see him and ask him, and on that day... he will probably say no lul.
$C: My family have a humongous collection (nearly 100) vintage and classical motorcycles hidden away in secure storage. Some over 100 years old, there's constant rumblings in the family that we need to sell them off at auction. I worry that the sheer volume means we will never get their full value as not many collectors have that sort of money, I also worry that they will not get the preservation and respect that they deserve.

I have some stupid fantasy/hope that when the family does put it to auction then someone like Keanu will come along and want to buy them.
$C: A romantic stroll along a cliffside overlooking the sunset with your cheek against his back your arms along his waist, and your hands clasped in a silent prayer to make this moment last forever, you heart thudding a promise to never let him go.
$C: I certainly bet you do missy.. 
$C: My gf said the same thing but she doesn't ride a motor....
$C: Yea man, I‚Äôd love to go for a ride on him 
$C: Why didn't you ask? I would've.
$C: Going on a ride with him and Norman Reedus would be like a dream come true. 
$C: I‚Äôd be his Bitch....I mean ride bitch.
$C: I met him at MotoGP in Austin, in the paddocks. Got to chit chat for a minute and he was off, but was incredibly nice the whole time. Guy loves his motorcycles, and racing. He wrongly predicted Rossi was going to win when I asked him though. Everyone knows Marquez owns COTA.
$C: I love to go on a ride with him too AMIRIGHT

But actually he‚Äôs old enough to be my dad but he‚Äôs still so young and good looking
$C: ‚ÄúRide‚Äù
$C: hit up pch or GMR
$C: Hell yea. 
$C: I too would love to ride Keanu.
$C: being a motorcyclist myself, i'd love to ride him
$C: I would love to be the second person on his motorcycle and hang on tight to him as his lucious locks smack me in the face.
$C: I like you! You have a great day too :)
$C: It would be a cool if this turned out to be Keanu's Reddit account.
$C: can someone explain why people like this fake wholesomeness so much? I think it's a bit depressing
$C: What if OP is a pedophile and this nice comment is the push that makes him think he is a great guy and his justifications for CP are accurate and he kidnaps a child :s.
$C: What if u/Lornstar7 was a serial killer or refuses to use gender neutral pronouns but happened to be a fan Keanu Reeves?
$C: u/BeingNiceIsNice is nice, and I'm sure being u/BeingNiceIsNice is nice.
$C: Is it really being nice if you are looking for opportunities to throw out a compliment?  Doesn't seem sincere 
$C: The fact that you started in the Formula One thread on a picture of Kimi gets an upvote 
$C: When you get 100~~0~~k karma, head over to /r/centuryclub, even though, with you being like a day old, you are probably already there as someone's alt. :)

eddit: uuuuug... thank you /u/jaggazz for [reminding me](http://i.imgur.com/GHmIgte.gifv)..

$C: Woah - I've got this open in a tab next to the Kimi instragram post from r/formula1.

You're replying to the top comment in both posts. You're putting in the hours on reddit today!
$C: Username 'checks out', which is to say that we can see some small evidence of it being an accurate description of the the user, if we are to judge him or her by this recent action.
$C: May kindness consume you, and may kindness radiate from you.


May your throat never be dry, and may your socks never be wet. 
$C: I started his account because I realized that the anonymity of Reddit sometimes brought out the worst in me. I figured a novelty account based on politeness would help me to be nicer and it actually worked lol.
$C: You know what?! Thanks man! 
$C: good bot
$C: You know nothing or this person, he COULD be a rapist or a murderer.

You just called a rapist a great guy
$C: Wow, expected the complete opposite. Reddit is amazing. 
$C: Hello there you sweet anomaly.
$C: What a wholesome comment.

$2 /u/tippr
$C: Tagged you as "Nice guy"! :)
$C: What inspired you is attention.  
$C: Yeah? Well fuck you too, pal.
$C: Keanu is that you???
$C: Is this Keanu Reeves' Reddit account?
$C: FACT: There is a mathematical chance this commenter is Keanu.
$C: Congratulations - your attitude brought tears to my eyes. Normally when a redditor does that, it's because they're mean.

$C: You're pretty nice. Carry on.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Well that's a nice thing to say. I'm sure he'd love to hang out with you too.
$C: I'm tired bro 
$C: ... What an odd coincidence. I just saw you on the F1 sub as well haha. Good on ya mate.
$C: smh. I started an account to rain down upvotes on my fellow redditers and regularly get down voted and told to eat a bag of dicks. 
$C: What‚Äôs this? The anti-troll? 
Being nice is ok but try being a dick...it‚Äôs more fun and satisfying. 
$C: How do you know they're not Hitler? 
$C: Your a joke, get real loser. 
$C: I like you!  Keep it up!!!
$C: 2017 was shit for everyone. You are deciding to be a better person for which is more than most people can say I feel. Keep on changing the world one comment at a time, you awesome motherfucker. 
$C: And this one, kind sir, is for you: https://twitter.com/matheusmorreu/status/947993803381723136
$C: Finally, my username is relevant.
$C: You make the world a better place. Thank you.
$C: You are nice. Have a good day. 
$C: [You seem nice. I like you.](https://i.imgur.com/ZfHFjGF.png)
$C: Wow this works way better than my own!!
$C: This could start a trend in a good direction. Good on you!
$C: Oh man now I want to delete this account and start fresh too! That could be my new years resolution lol.

P.S I love you
$C: I'm glad you change, everyone need to take you as a role model. Me stumbling to this comment also cheered me up
$C: This is the best thing I've read all day, thanks for this cheerful moment as I will now do my part to pay it forward as much as I can today :) 
$C: You‚Äôre awesome üòé 
$C: you said you were an ass before. what kind of things would you say to be an ass on  your other account?
$C: "It's nice to be nice to the nice."  Frank Burns, M*A*S*H
$C: Too much of anything is bad for you, including being nice! I would loose my mind around you.

$C: I like accounts like you. I‚Äôm going to follow you! 
Welcome to the gold club buddy! 
$C: You are very nice man. Have a nice day 
$C: No,no,no,no.... you sir, have a wonderful day.
$C: Fucking onions.
$C: Thank you for being so genuine. I hope you have a fantastic 2018!
$C: Welcome to Reddit, I love you
$C: Have upvote, hero
$C: you are awesome and kind and wonderful. truely being nice is nice.
all the best and hope you have a great 2018. 
$C: You are just a fantastic person. 
$C: Seeing the way he's so chill & appreciative of his fans is really refreshing. He seems to actively *not* want to live a life that involves wasting his wealth on stupid shit. Seems he prefers living in the "real world" instead of that hollywood lifestyle. I respect the shit out of that. Bike rider too? Bad ass!
$C: I'd let him hand me my ass in a 3 gun match any day. I'm sure his guns are nicer than mine, too.
$C: Better throw Tom Hanks in there for a wild card.
$C: You basically are
$C: Tom Hanks is America's dad, I think Keanu might be America's older brother 
$C: 1. Meet both
2. Upload to reddit
3. UNLIMITED KARMA!
$C: And Bill Murray will steal your fries.
$C: While you're looking for those two, don't forget to be on the lookout for Falcon 9 core's!
$C: Unless you're just really unlucky, then you'll meet Guy Fieri.
$C: It's inevitable, Mr. Anderson.
$C: Wander.
$C: Hmm I‚Äôve already met Bill here in Austin, so how much longer do I have to wait to meet Keanu?! Should I just keep looking in Austin? Maybe Bill knows. 
$C: Come to Austin for SXSW and hang out at the 4 Seasons. You'll see Bill Murray, Robert Duvall, and Owen Wilson every year hanging out in the lobby. I've seen them countless times during SXSW.
$C: For Bill Murray, just move to Charleston and go to the Riverdog games. Also, in NYC, his son owns a bar called 21 Greenpoint. He bartended for a night or two and will sometimes make appearances. He is very approachable.
$C: I sense a Steven King novel here.  And maybe a Broadway show?

$C: Apparently, Bill Murray lives in Hemet.
$C: #THE PROPHECY WILL BE FULFILLED! 
$C: I met a guy that looked a lot like Dave Grohl once. His name was Ken. He seemed nice and was wearing a banana costume on the street in June. Actually, other than some long hair facial hair, he didn‚Äôt look all that much like Dave but it reminded me of Dave so I say he looked like him. 
$C: I think I'd cry from the sheer awesome. I might be tearing up now thinking about how happy Dave Grohl would be in a bouncy house. 
$C: I just want some of them good-smelling cookies
$C: Keanu has been quoted encouraging people to come say hello, though... 
$C: > Can you imagine being asked to have a picture taken multiple times a day, every day of your life? 

No, and neither can you.

So stop giving useless advice when you could have no possible idea what he feels like.

For all you know, he could treasure these moments and feel like every fan coming up to him is the best thing that ever happens.

I know your intentions are good, but you are giving advice out of pure and utter ignorance. Never do that. 

This is like me saying: /u/throwaway_needshelp1 hates when people smile at him and say hello. Can you imagine having 5 people say that to you everyday? If you ever see him, scowl and turn away. 
$C: That joke is already taken
$C: I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as much staying out of trouble as genuinely being a good person who wouldn‚Äôt give any thought to doing something that would get them in trouble. It‚Äôs a subtle difference, but I think it‚Äôs important. 
$C: > It also seems like he spends a lot of time actually doing things he likes to do

So does Harvey Weinstein.
$C: He has fun with it.
$C: Keanu is The One.
$C: Is Bill Murray the one who helped out a friend or family member on opening night of their bar by bartending? And then every time someone ordered a drink Murray just nodded and poured a shot of tequila? I think it was Bill Murray. I hope it was Bill Murray.
$C: This fucker gets gold for this???  Take your gold and your karma but just know this comment deserves NOTHING!!  Oh yea and Keanu is awesome.
$C: Next time you meet him can you send him across the GWB to north Jersey?
$C: I‚Äôll lay out a nice offering of handguns, sunglasses and guitar picks. Maybe he‚Äôll come out 
$C: That looks like the Ralphs on Ventura and Coldwater in the Valley. 
$C: It's actually the Coldwater/Ventura Ralph's in Studio City.
$C:  I used to live in Vegas and big fight weekends were pretty ripe with celebs around the MGM and Mandalay area. Keanu would be amazing to meet though.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Awwww...

/r/Wholesomememes
$C: Oh my god make this happen
$C: Lmfao, I laughed out loud at this. Thanks. 
$C: Is like to subscribe to Norton facts.
$C: They're also known to try and kill you if you don't know how to work on them. Re: isolatic system.

Sauce: I have that bike. 
$C: Unfortunately it still used Lucas electronics...
$C: Norton's are amazing machines.
$C: Cousin had a Norton Combat and... it was not easy to set the timing and he sold it.  Fun when it ran right though.
$C: If you don't mind telling the story, I'd love to hear it.
$C: My dad had a 250 (edit, it was a NSU not Norton sorry) Norton Super Max in the early 60's. To hear him talk about that bike it was the second love of his life next to my mum.

A few years ago when he retired we looked around for a project one for him to restore then almost went grey at the price of even the worst examples. I really wish we had been able to do it for him.
$C: Yeah, Keanu is great and all....but look at that bike!

$C: Looks incredibly similar to Triumph and Matchless of the 60s and 70s. They were all English bikes so it's to be expected, I guess.
$C: Combat Commando is a beautiful bike! Surprised his headlights are working. British bike owners constantly joke about the terrible quality of the electrical system made my "Lucas".

ala:

-Why do the british drink their beer warm? Their refrigerators are made my Lucas.

-The Lucas motto: "Get home before dark."

[Lucas jokes](https://www.jaguarforums.com/forum/off-topic-6/collection-lucas-jokes-21723/)
$C: How do you work out it's a combat engine?  I thought the differences were all internal - plus the combat engines had (originally) black casings.
$C: Good eye my friend, yes it is. 

Now you, me, and Keanu are gonna hop on it, you know I've always wanted to try threesies. Jake? What're you thinking, handlebars? I've always seen you as a handlebars kinda guy.


(Dunno if I got the quote right, sorry)
$C: Pretty much everything prior to ~'82ish had "flipped" controls. They aren't really "flipped", every British bike was that way, Norton's, Triumph, BSA. The Japanese and American bikes started going the opposite in (an alleged) attempt to kill the British motorcycle market. (because retooling the casts to make the bikes would cost too much)
$C: I'm glad I could take you down that hole
$C: Ahhh one of my favorites 
$C: Someone brought back the blessings of 2014
$C: >trying to do a shopping

TIL Keanu is a rarepupper
$C: This is not the first time I've read such a comment and still my heart stops.
$C: I watched that awkwardly scrambling hug like 5 times and it got better every time.
$C: The John Player Special version of that Norton (well, the ‚Äò74...) is even nicer... Not vastly different than standard, but it just pulls in any gear and makes a noise like a rounded banshee. It‚Äôs a bit of a pig in a way, but such a joy to ride. 

Source: very fortunate to own one at 24... 

Interestingly Jay Leno has one (well, what doesn‚Äôt he have at least one of?). 
$C: https://goo.gl/maps/BJy3DBbaTrz

Definitely, that corner.  The 3 palm trees looking down Coldwater match up perfectly.  Used to go there all the time when I lived in the Valley. 
$C: me too
$C: You work for Michael Douglas?
$C: My father and I brought a COMPELTELY parted out Norton Commando from one of his old friends for $500. I mean, this guy took it apart 99% of the way. And then never put it back together. Threw it in dozens of boxes in no order. 

Took us months just to sort everything out. We're almost done building it. I'm super looking forward to riding it. 

Just wish I took pictures/video along the way. 
$C: WORDDDDD
$C: The Ralphs in downtown has a bar.
$C: Ironically, when they come is when he stops being straight.
$C: Can you comment without including the word "cuck"? It's literally a nice guy riding a motorcycle. Is your masculinity so fragile that you cannot be nice to other human beings?
$C: And then what did he say?
$C: So what‚Äôs with all these Keanu posts you make?
$C: Even better.
$C: It's a very nice circle jerk though.
$C: I'd love a link unless his Wiki page is enough to go off of. Always up to learn more about my favorite people
$C: Thank you lol that makes sense. But only 700 subs :(
$C: definitely saw it coming there
$C: yup.


$C: Maybe a little more. Didn't see the combat engine the first time. 
$C: I can't imagine how offended they would be if somebody did the same to them.
$C: Truly an underrated human being. If I saw him, I would buy a him a beer. 
$C: Oh thanks! That really clears it up...
$C: Ah, that explains the taste in motorbikes.
$C: Then he called out the op who hasn't even responded ahaha
$C: If you would have seen the karma influx as soon as this would posted then you too would question it. This is obviously advertising Keanu
$C: Ruptured, not taken. Without a spleen he‚Äôd be prone to infections like a mofo and we‚Äôd have no Keanu.
$C: Can't disagree with you there!
$C: I was just kidding. Its John Wick part 3 shooting going on so he is seen out there quite a lot. 
$C: Cool cool
$C: [deleted]
$C: Why, is Keanu at the door? :O
$C: No
$C: Among motorcyclists (which I am not) it stands for "All The Gear, All The Time." It means that even if you go for a local cruise to the 7-11 for Ben & Jerry's, one still adorns PPE. (Personal Protective Equipment.)

That includes helmet, eye wear, boots that cover the ankles, resistant clothing like leather or denim, and gloves. These items have demonstrated an ability to mitigate injuries caused by motorcycle accidents.
$C: 1/3 btc !
$C: Yea didn't peep that 
$C: She should bitch at Key and Peele with me! Class action, baby! 

Vets generally love meeting Keanu Reeves (my surname) the cat. Haha. 
$C: You are a happy tool of those who seek to manipulate the public. People like you are the reason there is so much deception and misleading rhetoric. Because it works on you and people like you. And you are blissful in your mindless ignorance and gullibility.
$C: no don't get me wrong, he is THE coolest like wow. Wish more people were like him tbh, but nah he's just getting so popular these days as in I'm seeing him show up on all my social media its strange
$C: John Wick series so far is awesome! Far from ‚Äúok‚Äù.
$C: I love him so much. He's so cool.
$C: It does look like Michael 
$C: No I see that. I have no problem with it, I like Keanu Reeves too, I was just curious if he was doing something that keeps putting him on the front page.
$C: but he custom built his bikes for (i assume) himself and other like minded rich people?
$C: I‚Äôve just been seeing so many more recently I love it though
$C: Nice
$C: Remember the Pratt obsession?
$C: That was so eloquently put well done 
$C: Fucking hunners of celebrities kicking about that are sound and aren't pedos.
I'm no slagging the cunt just wondering the obsession 
$C: But cars have seatbelts 
$C: Mr. Rogers too!
$C: Bill Murray is missing...
$C: Well I just imagined a Keanu/Dave baby. Thanks for that.
$C: Arnold Schwarzenegger? I know he has a reddit account and has even replied to people on here before. Seems like a cool guy.
$C: Dwayne Johnson is one, I think.
$C: Can we add Patrick Stewart to the list?
$C: Honorable mention to Bill Murray
$C: I feel like any ent has to say snoop also. 
$C: Mr Rogers and maybe Carl Sagan
$C: Amazing that they are all men. 
$C: Probably because they are genuinely nice people, it‚Äôs impossible to fake being nice for long periods of time.

Who would be on the arsehole list that balances the universe?
$C: Can't believe everyone forgot about Snoop - u/Here_Comes_The_King is a Reddit legend and a legendary good guy
$C: There we have it
$C: Throw in Mr. Roberts and that Asian chick who used to be Reddit‚Äôs CEO.
$C: Neil degrasse Tyson.
$C: Dwayne Johnson. Jackie chan
$C: Substitute Bob Ross for Verne Troyer, if we're talking living celebrities.
$C: I might reconsider Dave Grohl. As a fellow musician, it was pretty shitty what he did to Foo‚Äôs drummer, Will Goldsmith back in the day.
$C: While reading your list I was hoping to see Tom Hanks  
$C: all men. NICE REDDIT
$C: Dude, can't forget Bill Murray 
$C: Peter Mayhew?
$C: Bill Murray.
$C: Add bill murray and you got a perfect list 
$C: Chris Pratt?
$C: Ajit Pai?
$C: Aren‚Äôt you forgetting r/onetruegod?
$C: Where‚Äôs Bill Gates on that list? C‚Äômon
$C: Bill Murray and Brian Cranston?
$C: Elon Musk as of late.
$C: and morgan freeman
$C: Nicolas Cage! 
$C: I'd replace Dave Grohl with Billy Murray, and maybe have Dave as the 6th if there was a 6th.
$C: Hi, I'm Dylan, I spit hot fire.
$C: Does Tom Hanks count?
$C: Brendan frasier would be on there
$C: Val kilmer?
$C: I rip and I rhyme, and rhyme and rip. This is the way that Dylan spitz. 
$C: Don't forget /u/vernetroyer
$C: Let‚Äôs not forget about snoop
$C: I suddenly have the urge for some Cambodian breast milk
$C: DID YOU FORGET /r/ONETRUEGOD????
$C: No bill Murray? 
$C: Bill Murray beat his wife though. So good guy may not be the right phrase. But he is loved.
$C: What about Reddit's favorite actress Gal Gadot?
$C: Brendan Frasier 
$C: https://i.imgur.com/dnZWUxM.gifv
$C: You forgot Bob Ross!
$C: I don't see Mr. Rogers in this list.
$C: I need more Governator reddit posts!
$C: So, who is reddit's top 5 *least* favorite celebrities?
$C: How can you forget Weird Al Yankovic!!
$C: @/u/Xidus_

^hi
$C: Val Kilmer does an AMA in r/movies every other week it seems like and he always seems happy to answer people's questions every time and graciously respond to "I'm you're huckleberry" for the 200 millionth time. I'd put him in the list.
$C: Y'all forgot that bad assed Mr. Rogers.
$C: Snoop Dogg?
$C: Verne Troyer? 
$C: You forgot Veegor Morgensteen
$C: Bill Gates, too.
$C: wait what about dave? 
$C: For sure Val Kilmer
$C: LOL

$C: Bill Murray too! 
$C: this is really good top @Xidus_
$C: "dont at me"?
$C: See you can tell when it is just a trendy kind of love like a crush.  But what we have for Keanu and Terry is more.  Much more. 
$C: Until reddit got butthurt that she called people out for sharing her stolen nude photos.
$C: Until everyone saw her naked. Because that's actually what they were obsessed with.

It's the old male classic: love em, bang em, leave em.
$C: And James Franco.
$C: Yeah but that was before she opened her mouth and proved to us otherwise.
$C: Tom Hanks should make any list
$C: Mister Rogers üôÇ
$C:  He definitely makes the list 
$C: On one of his typewriters?
$C: I like seeing his comments in the wild, they‚Äôre usually acknowledging movie quotes because he loves making fans lose their shit and most other times he‚Äôs talking about lifting because that‚Äôs obviously just something he is very passionate about. He‚Äôs pretty great.
$C: I want to stalk him around reddit and reply to everyone of his posts with "GET TO DE CHOPPAH!!!"
$C: Does anyone remember Ellen Pao?
$C: Ajit Pai is like all of EA distilled into a single person.
$C: Ajit Pai is the Tom Wheeler we thought Tom Wheeler was going to be.
$C: Fuck Ajit Pai.

As opposed to, please God, if you grant me one wish, let me someday get to fuck Keanu Reeves.

Such a versatile little verb.
$C: You forget that in America, corporations are people... so Comcast would take the cake.
$C: 

[-p.s.-Fuck Ajit Pai](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7jxtrv/friday_fun_offtopic_megathread/drab96b)


$C: Snoop Dogg Intern?

$C: I would say so, given that he is an active Redditor.
$C: And Steve Jobs!

Edit: I MEANT BILL GATES SHIT IM SORRY
$C: Ok but who doesnt like Snoop D O double G? 
$C: Was going to put Kilmer on the list if someone hadn‚Äôt already.

His AMAs have been absolutely awesome...  truly a stand-up guy.
$C: >Bill Nye

Reddit turned on him hardcore after his "Sex Junk" music video and gender identity stuff. His AMA two months ago is 54% upvoted, with some of his comments in the negative.
$C: > Neil Degrasae-Tyson

Not as often these days. We see him a lot on /r/iamverysmart . He's been pretty pretentious lately.

And Bill Nye has been spewing some pretty crazy nonsense too on his twitter account.
$C: I'll trade you a Neil Degrasae-Tyson and a Bill Nye for a Carl Sagan
$C: Willie Nelson, jimmy Buffett 
$C: You sure? Pretty sure I've heard multiple stories here about his douchiness.
$C: In the general election, sure. In the primaries, I would hope to have some stronger candidates. 
$C: From the angle and expression of his gaze, I'd say they were either puppies or toddlers.
$C: Yeah most redditors are super hot women
$C: He looks to be really happy for this picture right? So, probably 
$C: Maybe he just knows it'll make a strangers day and he does it just to mess with people? I could see myself doing that if I was him.
$C: This saint of a man would not be gawking at women at a stop light. He is too pure for that. 
$C: The source is a girl's tweet.  I don't feel like checking, but I assume she's good looking.
$C: Bodacious babes
$C: Or someone else on a hot motorcycle/car
$C: In the red dress.
$C: He's not gonna turn away free pizza
$C: Uses reddit...

Or

Super hot woman...


Pick one




^^^/s
$C: [removed]
$C: There's a reflection in his eye-ware.  Someone enhance that shit.
$C: Probably women looking for shelter
$C: Maybe he was ogling their pudendum 
$C: Were it hot women, his eyes would be soft, a benevolent gaze.  The way a woman should be looked at.  It‚Äôs the Keanu Way. 
$C: Agent Smith
$C: Probably
$C: This man Motorcycles. You just can't help it. Sometimes even a "Hey, nice bike!"
$C: Especially if it's a classic Norton!
$C: unless you ride a scooter
$C: Shhh.. what happens in the restroom stays in the restroom. 
$C: Ah, like Andy Dick in a men's room.
$C: Unless it's a Harley.
$C: Its the bike i‚Äôm meant to be looking at? I‚Äôve been doing it wrong. Tell me I got the ass-less chaps thing right though?
$C: "...out of the corner of your eye you spot him."

*Shia LaBeouf*
$C: If find this guy funny. Absolutely not a punchable person.
$C: Keanu is Spiderman, confirmed.
$C: Probably not Keanu but his PR firm.
$C: Keanu is obviously karmanaut
$C: "I know rappers that call paparazzi to cone and get em, to show they outfits off, guess they need the attention"
$C: Conspiracy Keanu back in action
$C: Plot twist. Keanu is OP‚Äôs stocker
$C: Keanuceptiom
$C: Should've been KeanuBeingKeanu :P
$C: this is awesome
$C: And you better subscribe to it! 
$C: I think you just showed me the greatest sub of all time.
$C: The source isn't even a real source. And that source's source isn't a real source.

Source: http://mr-reeves.com/keanu-reeves-norton-last-night/

Ironically, it's generating a Matrix-like reality in the sense that tons of people think this *just* happened to the person who posted it. They're responding to it & integrating it into their reality & carrying on about it.
$C: OP does have a weird amount of highly upvoted posts. Its almost like half the things he posts get over 20K.
$C: Definitely more likely. 
$C: Are you speaking from experience, or just assuming? 
$C: I've been seeing a lot of Keanu on Reddit lately, I wonder if we should expect a new movie announcement?
$C: Hey if you can link me that, I can link you what I said.

If I had a stalker, I wouldn't acknowledge them when they're taking a picture of me. C'mon now.

Edit: oh shit, I was referencing another comment I made. Keanu encourages people to say hello.
$C: Then why would Keanu acknowledge him?
$C: Yep, exactly what u/HeroCastrator said.

You could get laid just simply being around this guy. It kind of sucked I was dating his cousin, lol.
$C: strange. all. day.,everyday.
$C: Doesn‚Äôt matter had sex.
$C: Good point. Might be better to walk into a crowded area and yell ‚ÄúIS ANYONE HERE KEANU REEVES?!‚Äù
$C: Short term... Double hyena recovery (my 3 yr old's pronunciation).

But yeah. Funny enough, I'd forgotten a young Will Macy was in this... Hilarious. 
$C: His lover actually.
$C: I think he may have a shrine set up to him in a room no one‚Äôs allowed into.
$C: stalker*
$C: Neo John Wick Constantine needs no body guard. 
$C: Or publicist.
$C: It is unknown who this human is. 
$C: Is Keanu gay or straight? It‚Äôs confusing as hell.
$C: He doesn't have a bodyguard.
$C: "Anddd Iiiiiiii-eeee-iiiiiii.... will always.... love yoouuuu.... "
$C: >*Found Keanu‚Äôs press secretary.
$C: Nope.  It's a Peter Parker/Spiderman scenario.  The guy taking the pictures **IS** Keanu!  That is how he always gets the good shots.
$C: Such a weird way to spell stalker 
$C: *stalker....
$C: I'd honestly be scared to get into a fight with Keanu.
$C: Let the man live his life in peace. Let‚Äôs not become part of the paparazzi blight 
$C: It was probably more like ‚ÄúI stalked Keanu for half a day and most of it was spent sitting outside in his bushes but he finally left and I followed him in traffic until we stopped at a red light and I was able to sneak up next to him to snap this pic‚Äù
$C: I don't think OP has ever actually met Keanu or seen him in person, just posted his pics to reddit for the karma.
$C: /r/KeanuStalking

$C: [deleted]
$C: #there is! it's @ r/keanubeingawesome
$C: /r/lordkeanu/
$C: I like seeing you see people see that person.
$C: It really is. Not sure we should be enabling this.

I mean, folks endlessly go on around here about how is such totally normal (and extremely nice) dude that just goes about his day like everyone else and doesn't conspicuously wall himself off from the masses. At the same time, these very people are enabling a person and sub dedicated to stalking this guy?

I mean, y'all realize that there is no way someone who confessed to being obsessed about Keanu, just happened to stumble upon him and take this great pic, right?
$C: Looking at OP's profile, I'm guessing for the karma.
$C: That is until someone on r/askreddit says he‚Äôs unfriendly.
$C: Those aren't all OP's photos.
$C: Wiw you actually thought about another person and didnt feel you had the right to forcefully insert yourself into their presence. Nice
$C: What park is on Canal Street that's also in Soho? There's (was) a park in Nolita (not on Canal Street), and a park in Chinatown on Canal Street. 
$C: We are a fickle lover.
$C: He‚Äôs Reddit‚Äôs new Chris Pratt, Jlaw and Rhonda rowsey 
$C: Just wait until /r/conspiracy notices this trend...
$C: He must have a great PR firm
$C: Forreal! It‚Äôs almost like he‚Äôs a celebrity or something 
$C: Keanu should be president!
$C: I mean, it can't get much worse, I'd settle for anything.
$C: The mainstream subs are so manipulated nowadays. I wish there was another place to spend my boredom
$C: I can do the same here in NYC.  A post about a celebrity meeting isn't unusual.  A shitload of posts about the same one all hitting the front page on consecutive days screams marketing campaign though.
$C: Looks like it'd be for the new Bill & Ted movie. Totally up reddit's alley.
$C: Not enough, we need to go deeper
$C: Yeah but then got vengeance on those that killed the puppy. 
$C: On his way home, in and out of traffic Keanu Weaves. 
$C: Hates to be stopped on his bike, one of Keanu's pet peeves
$C: Where he's spending one of his lonely Keanu eve's.
$C: You tried too hard, Keanu displeased
$C: And from matrix franchise Keanu believes
$C: For*
$C: As kanye sees blood on keanus leaves
$C: His dog's name Shiba Keanu. 
$C: Up my sleeves up my sleeves Up my sleeves up my sleeves Up my sleeves up my sleeves Up my sleeves up my sleeves Up my sleeves up my sleeves Up my sleeves up my sleeves 
$C: And wife and Daughter...too soon?
$C: So he eats some bad sushi and Keanu heaves
$C: He hates this reference. It's Keanu's pet peeves. 
$C: Drinking to numb the sadness Keanu heaves.
$C: Then he goes to his trophy room to look at all his Keanu wins.
$C: I was surprised how far I had to go for this one. [3]
$C: Learn how to rhyme.
$C: To sip in peace with Keanu ease
$C: Thank you! You are the redditor I needed, maybe not the redditor that I deserved, but at the very least a redditor that is on the ball. Kind of a reverse Batman sort of situation.

Edit: Grammar. 
$C: Tickled his nose.. achoo..Keanu sneeze
$C: Sh sh. You'll ruin the ruse before IM gilded. 
$C: No dude .He was just beeing salty because he didn't write this awesome pun first  . Reddit loves good Puns , jokes and art .
$C: We all are 
$C: it does now
$C: The thought of not wearing them makes Keanu Skeeve 
$C: Anybody else hear his voice when reading that?
$C: I said "whoa" in his bill and ted voice... On a side note, if the immortal man himself wears a helmet while riding, everone should do the same.
$C: I can't stop laughing at this image!
$C: Hiya Jimmy
$C: Totally agree. Wanting a motorcycle is one of my earliest memories, but I was never allowed or able to get one. Got one at age 34 after my divorce, and it‚Äôs better than I imagined! It‚Äôs the complete focus of your machine and your surroundings that helps clear the mind of other things. 
$C: Cool I use the gym as my release. This sounds much more intense though, cause you can die. Either way everybody needs a way of release.
$C: I only get off my bike when I fall in love... or fall dead.
$C: It's so zenful for me. When I ride I am so in touch with all my surroundings, and wary of any dangers that are near me and appreciating nature, in a very focused level of concentration, that my brain can't spare anymore functionality towards thinking about things that have nothing to do with me being on the bike and everything that I am currently dealing with on the road. For someone who is an overthinker, I've never been able to experience 'shutting off my brain' and not have any sort of anxiety until I started riding a bike. It's now my biggest passion in life and I truly am a different person during the part of the year that I can't ride. I started riding at 30 so it's never too late.
$C: But you have a 500% higher chance of death in the case of an accident than a car driver. 
$C: And the little old lady who doesn't see you.  And that gravel on the curve.
$C: And your skin when you fall. 
$C: Until you have an accident and are paralyzed or wind up like Gary Busey. Then it‚Äôs not so spiritual and enlightened anymore. 
$C: For me (in Michigan) it was 25 dollars to take the class over one weekend at a local community college. Books and bikes were provided. And they administer the written and practical exam so you don't have to take it at the DMV. You also get a high visibility vest which is apparently worth more than 25 dollars itself.  Only thing you needed was a helmet and gear.

I think the price has increased to 50 dollars since. But either way an incredible deal. Dealerships will offer the same class and try to charge hundreds of dollars for it.
$C: I would say this is sorta true. I'm a 5'0, tiny woman. Pretty much every bike is a monster to me. I got one to ride to work (cooler moped) and the safety course was scary, I dropped my 250 the first slope I ended up on, lowered it several inches, and it still took months to be comfortable. It was just so big my feet barely touched the ground and any mistake while still or low speeds meant a fall. 

That was 5 years ago. I have learned a ton and have a ninja 650 now I lowered a bit. It's fine. As I get older, less in shape, and lazier I think of getting a smaller bike again. Maybe a cruiser this time with a low seat height. 

Being short for motorcycles sucks. Riding is great, any low speed maneuver is a gamble. I wish they made bikes catered to short people.
$C: Purple fingered terror.  That‚Äôs how I describe riding. I hold on so hard the person I‚Äôm holding on to has trouble breathing. 

I tried learning on a wee baby 50 cc motor. I hated every single nanosecond of it. 

I am not meant to ride motorcycles.
$C: I took the course originally when I started, it was absolutely invaluable. I had some guys in the class with me who had been riding for years tell me they got a lot out of it as well. I'm planning on retaking it soon, since I just upgraded from a 660cc to a 1700cc and the refresher could potentially be a lifesaver. I strongly recommend it to everyone who wants to ride, new or old.
$C: Yeah especially the plural part of "accidents". He makes it sound real nice but a ruptured spleen doesn't feel like my cup of tea.
$C: Buy good gear and ride defensively.  When you fall down get right back up. It's just like life.
$C: Honestly every crashed, I‚Äôve got scars to prove it. Despite that it‚Äôs a special kind of mind state it puts you in.  10/10 would recommend. 
$C: I'd recommend skipping that part then. 

I've commuted and ridden across the country several times over two decades without crashing.  I still dress expecting to crash every time though. 
$C: Lost 2 close friends to motorcycle accidents over the years but the thing that really made me say no was standing in a yard near a guy who had wiped out. Flight for life came in and I watched as they shut down the helicopter and pulled the sheet up.

Only person I have ever watched die and it still makes me uncomfortable to think about it.
$C: if you start learning how to drive on a big motorbike, well, it's the recipe for disaster. All the people i know who are bikers usually have this in common: 3-7 you learn the basic of a baby bike, 7+ regular bike, 14+ 50cc automatic moped, 18+ geared small motorbike 200-500cc, 21+ any motorbike you can rise from the ground yourself 1000cc+. If you usually skip some of these steps, you end up injured or worst. (before driving my first geared motorbike, i was literally dreaming of driving it, switching gears and stuff like that)
$C: It's the other people part that deters me.
$C: Used to have.a 175cc Yamaha scooter.  It tops out at 60 miles an hour. It doesn‚Äôt have a lot of power either but was really convenient for getting around. You get the same open air freedom experience of riding which is quite a thrill. 

I also learned a lot about defensive driving and the perspective of cyclists versus vehicles on visibility. Which is why I have an extreme hate for loud, aggressive, obnoxious motorcycles and riders. 

I wiped out a few times, half the time because the scooter‚Äôs tires were small and didn‚Äôt have very good traction

This quote from Keanu is so perfect. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: General rule of thumb is that most people do crash their first bike. I was t-boned on my Ducati and flipped over the bars, helmet hit their windshield and I landed on my back in someone‚Äôs yard. But I love riding, it‚Äôs the intense feeling of being in absolute control and being totally focused in on the moment. 
$C: Get an enduro bike or an mx bike for riding trails.  No idiot drivers to worry about, and it's way more fun.  I've been riding off road bikes since I was 7 years old.  I have my license, but I don't have a street bike because drivers where I live don't pay attention to bikes on the road.
$C: Its really not as bad as it sounds.
$C: I can verify, I was able to fully recover from mine but I would just consider track but public roads are super dangerous.
$C: Number 1 cause for athletes in Northern Countries in Paralympics is Motorcycle accidents...
$C: He doesn't even have a spleen anymore
$C: Crossed the country a couple years ago, including the N-S breadth of wyoming, and decided to only clean the top of my screen for the whole trip, by the time I got home, I had a solid 1/8" of bug goop covering the lower sections. 
$C: Yeah... Fuck Wyoming wind. It doesn't matter what road you are on they all have their secret "Haha Fooled you" stretches. 



Source: Grew up in the "Equality State" 


The stretch from Wheatland to Chugwatter is my favorite "Fuck you" from nature. That one mile between the wind socks can be nuts.  I saw at least a dozen trucks taking naps on the side of the road one fine Friday many years ago
$C: I love my little flyshield. It moves the wind up off of your chest to your shoulders and head. To me it's a great compromise for someone like me who does a 120 mile commute every day.

If a family member or long time friend tells me I'm awesome - I feel good.

If a stranger tells me I'm awesome after impressing them - I feel good.

If a stranger tells me I'm awesome out of thin air... It does nothing for me. I'd think they're a bit odd.

$C: Although I‚Äôm not sure about u/beingincelisnice
$C: yeah it's pretty much meaningless, all of those wholesome subs and accounts copy paste nice things without meaning or giving a shit about who are they writing to to feel better about themselves
$C: It‚Äôs better than looking for reasons to NOT be nice.  (Troll)
$C: Dude is going out giving people compliments, honestly we just need more of that in today's world I don't see anything wrong with that. I know my day would be that much better if opened my Reddit account and saw a compliment.


AS FOR YOU!!! I hope you have a very pleasant rest of your day and no matter what your day throws at you, keep your chin up cause your better then it. remember your awesome =)

$C: The two can't exist in the same location in space & time. The universe has a finite source of awesome to pull from. It would be cataclysmic. 
$C: There's a web series idea,  Bill Murray and Keanu Reeves travel the country together meeting random people together and hanging out. They'll go to high school plays, local diners,  town football games, water slide parks, small comedy clubs etc. They can ride a motorcycle with a side car in each location.

$C: Step 4. PROFIT
$C: Imagine Bill riding on the back of Keanu's bike.
$C: But no one will believe you
$C: I once had a ten minute conversation with Bill Murray in the middle of a city street on a Saturday night and cars just drove around us. Not one person honked.
$C: Murray meetup check. Awaiting inevitable Keanu sighting. 25 years ago Murr tipped me $20, and apologized for not having more. Biggest tip I got all year, it was rare to be tipped as an usher in a performance space. Class act.

$C: James Joseph Norton Jr. (born July 19, 1968) is an American comedian, radio personality, actor, author, and television and podcast host. Norton has been the co-host of the podcast UFC Unfiltered with Matt Serra and the morning radio show Jim Norton and Sam Roberts on SiriusXM since 2016, and The Chip Chipperson Podacast since 2017.
$C: Those bikes are friggin' HEAVY. At least a couple of their models use an interesting suspension system, whereby the exhaust pipes wrap around the engine to make for a compact design and smoother ride. My dad used to restore Nortons, his pride and joy was a [Norton Dominator ("the dommie")](http://www.motorcyclespecs.co.za/Gallery%20%20A/Norton%20Dominator%20650SS%2066.jpg)
$C: > isola**s**tic system

You missed an 's' :)

For those curious, here is a short summary on wikipedia about the construction, and why it's dangerous (when bushings are close to worn out):

(edit: formatting and spelling)
$C: Huh?
$C: Is that the series wired earthing system i found on the googles? It was hard to search that term.
$C: Oh come on you can't leave us hanging! Tell me everything!
$C: Agreed. And it didn't get any better with the 850 Commando. Same sauce.  But they are still very, very cool. 
$C: Uhhm check your facts.  
$C: Norton AntiRider
$C: [The Sauce?](https://youtu.be/T_cQ_IZxDHY)
$C: Why do they drink warm beer in England? Because Lucas makes their refrigerators.

What's an ideal first car to buy for your teenager? Any one with Lucas electronics, they'll always be home before dark.

Edison invented the light bulb, Lucas invented the dim bulb.
$C: Knowing Keanu he probably modified it. I'm sure you're aware of how big he is into bikes. 
$C: The Prince of Darkness.
$C: Joke all you want about Lucas electronics, but my dad found a 1956 Ariel buried in our garden (veeeery long story) and the original headlight (Lucas) still worked after 40 years in the ground. The thing was like a fishbowl with all the water. He just drained it, let it dry out, hooked it up to a battery and it still worked. 
$C: I believe electronic ignition upgrades are acceptable on antique bikes.

And before anybody rags on me for calling a '72 "antique", I also am a 1972 model.
$C: No they didn't have black cases. The Combat was only released in 1972, the last year for the 750cc Commando and the first year for front disc brake.  If it's a 750 with a front disc, it's a Combat. 
$C: Still, my dad wasn't exactly thrilled with having to get specialized tools. He could get an Imperial bit to work every now and again but you really need the Whitworth stuff to take one of them apart for regular maintenance.
$C: No, in 1975 it was required that all bikes being imported to the USA shift on the left hand side, brake on the right, for safety concerns. The 1975 Norton Commando is the first Commando to shift on the left (and last year they even made Nortons).  And the Commandos were slightly different than the Triumphs and BSAs, as they used the "GP" shifting pattern:  Up for 1st gear, Down for 2nd, 3rd, 4th.

$C: Reddit is just the best.
$C: Enough time has passed since the viral video about his tragic life has passed to where you can really just Google it and most results will show the true from the exaggerated. Some of the lowlights include his father leaving at like age 3, losing a child to stillbirth and with it a relationship in the late 90s, the River Phoenix overdose hit him extremely hard because they were really close friends. Its been a rough road for the man. 
$C: I can tell you straight away his child was still born and then his girlfriend was killed in a car crash.

 He was also seriously injured in a bike crash (his fault thought riding at night with no headlights on) 
$C: Jeez Louise...I had a well-used BSA when I was a youth. Learned pretty quick that BSA stands for Bastard Stopped Again...on another note: Why do the British drink warm beer? Because they have Lucas refrigerators!
$C: Sorry I couldn't resist. It seems he is a really nice guy and keeps being seen out and hence reddit are posting sitings of him regularly as a result 
$C: This guy sounds incredibly paranoid. 
$C: I want to buy some Keanu. Where might I go to get some?
$C: It was removed. He has a huge scar down his abdomen

I knew a kid in elementary school who crashed into a wall while sledding and had his spleen removed. He had a special helper during recess because he wasn't allowed to do anything too strenuous. I hope he's doing well now.

**EDIT**: Ok, Ok, per one of the many nice requests below I've created a sub lol. https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteMrPractical1/
$C: Por que no los dos?
$C: I met Keanu Reeves at a restaurant once - we‚Äôd accidentally been given his table. Apparently he was fond of the restaurant and had a specific table he liked, and the management had messed up and gotten their days wrong, (it was Tuesday and they thought he was coming on Thursday or something like that). Anyway, the manager, completely embarrassed (this is a pretty nice restaurant) comes by and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, but we‚Äôd like to move you to another table if you could be troubled, and we‚Äôll gladly compensate you for the cost of the meal and any other meal you‚Äôd like while you‚Äôre in town.‚Äù My sister and cousin were both like ‚ÄúYeah that‚Äôs cool.‚Äù and I kind of played the asshole a bit. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I just don‚Äôt understand. We‚Äôve been here for 15 minutes - we‚Äôve just ordered. Can‚Äôt we finish our meal here?‚Äù Then out of nowhere Keanu Reeves shows up next to the manager and says ‚ÄúPaul, these guys can finish. We‚Äôll be at the bar. I got some time.‚Äù And I (being a big Matrix fan) said ‚ÄúOh wow, uh‚Ä¶ I had no idea. Please feel free to give them the table.‚Äù Keanu was grateful, shook my hand and said thanks, then gave me a card with his number on it and told me to give him a call later. After working up the nerve, I gave him a call that night, and to make a long story short, we had a glorious 11 month love affair, man on man, that I shall never forget. Our bodies intertwined as one, and from the beauty of Morocco, to the French Riviera, to the snorkeling in the Galopagos, Keanu Reeves and I made glorious gay love to each other on six of the seven continents.


$C: When you have to leave he's Sad Keanu, but when you're back in his arms he's Glad Keanu
$C: You spelled ‚Äústalker‚Äù wrong. 
$C: Found Keanu
$C: I smell a pitch for Bodyguard 2.
$C: Does Keanu know about this?
$C: Found Keanu¬¥s stalker 
$C: Why not both?
$C: Any man should be so lucky.
$C: Got any allegations to back this up?
$C: His dog actually
$C: I had a completely different experience with Keanu, personally.

I saw Keanu Reeves at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn‚Äôt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.
He said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù
I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.
$C: Stalker
$C: I beg to differ! He‚Äôs mine! En garde!
$C: Well... no one except Keanu.  
  
And the maid, of course.  Can't have dusty shrines ya know?
$C: He would win.
$C: Yeah it's creepy af
$C: Let's hope he's just a reddit whore. 
$C: Maybe /r/LeaveKeanuAlone, packed with images and videos of people stalking the stalkers of Keanu Reeves.
$C: Woaaaaah dude, it's happening!
$C: There‚Äôs definitely some weirdos in this world.  I‚Äôm just gonna do my part and downvote all of this person‚Äôs Keanu Reeves posts and make comments like these in all their posts.  Because this individual definitely has an obsession and it seems unhealthy and disturbing  

$C: [deleted]
$C: [deleted]
$C: Don't forget Brendan Fraser
$C: new? When has Keanu never been popular/cool?
$C: Or maybe he earned his goodwill organically by being a cool dude.
$C: Reddit loves Keanu Reeves, so it's good karma for anyone posting a pic, even if the pic is old. I seriously doubt Keanu's agent needs to have a social media marketing campaign involving fake candid shots of him. It's not like his career is in the toilet.
$C: Is that coming out soon?  I thought they only just started making it.
$C: When he finally exhales after killing every bad guy in the building:
*Keanu Breathes*
$C: Greeting at his frontdoor, Keanu's Jeeves
$C: Astride his Norton (no, not a Greeves).
$C: Overcome by vertigo, Keanu heaves.
$C: Keanu already made it home in this story! You messing up the flow damnit!
$C: When you are rude, Keanu seethes. 
$C: Oops. I mean HEY GILD THIS GUY!
$C: Keanu guys stop
$C: How could you not?
$C: I‚Äôm reading everything in this thread in his voice, I even read what I‚Äôm writing now in his voice
$C: Excellent! *air guitar solo*
$C: Excellent.  
$C: To pic a large nit, a full face helmet saved me being dead or needing a prosthetic face. 
$C: [Whoooooaaaaaa!](http://i.imgur.com/3IaBXRa.gifv)
$C: My dad used to pick me up from elementary school on his motorcycle so I was always kind of destined down the path of riding at some point. First time I ever rode was on his Ducati liter bike! 
$C: Yep, just got one a few months ago, I'll be 30 in a couple months. Can't wait for spring.

I love driving, but cars are expensive. My bike gets about 60mpg, I can go riding all day for $5-10. You also dont need to go as fast to feel speed. Modern cars feel slow even over 100, the bike feels fast over 60. Mines a dual sport as well so i can go off road and that feels fast over 30.
$C: 36 here. Fuck everyone that kept me from getting one my whole life. My motorcycle is my favorite non-living thing in my life. 
$C: That's true.
$C: Once this world can afford to lose me, I think I'll get one too. Until then, I'll remain boring :(
$C: I've had to have surgery on my shoulder and I've herniated a disk in my back from the gym. Never had any injuries from the bike. 

The gym is my destressor though so totally get where you're coming from with that. Skiing and guitar also does the same sort of thing for me. But the bike is as close to that feeling of flying you can get imo. 
$C: I worry about those when I cross a street too. 
$C: Wear some gear üëç
$C: That can also happen when I cross a street or drive my car. 
$C: Cocaine made Busey the way he is, not the accident.
See [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSNQ3F0DWPE) with him a year after the accident.
$C: It's $250 here in VA. Still worth every penny.
$C: Yeah, it was 200 something for me in Oregon, good on Michigan for whatever allows them to do it so inexpensively!

Worth it though. As soon as they had us playing with the clutch and moving forward a little I got this huge smile on my face, I was hooked instantly.
$C: Have you considered a Grom? They're like a toy in terms of maneuverability for a taller person, if you're shorter they may be just right. I've seen them on the highway, although I don't know about long highway rides. 
A cruiser might be right though. I've never ridden one, but sat on them. The height is definitely right, but low speed maneuvering may still be a challenge, I don't know.
$C: Lots of places have an advanced class as well, which might be more valuable to you than the same beginner course.
$C: Like the other guy said, the MSF offers a few advanced courses that you can take. They have BRC2 and Advanced Rider Course that you can take with your own bike to get more comfortable with it as well. 
$C: It's not something people think about with motorcycles, but everyone will crash their bikes and usually will do it often. Granted most of the crashes aren't deadly or serious, but they happen. 

Most will be hitting a bit of gravel and sliding across pavement. Might have some road rash and some bruises, but nothing you will die from. That's why protective gear is so important since it allows you to get back up mostly unscathed and keep on riding afterwards.

You only have two patches of your two tires to keep you upright and stable on the road, that's a lot less than what cars have which is why so many accidents happen on motorcycles. They aren't very stable. 
$C: A friend ruptured his spleen in a crash in Austria and it was so bad they had to remove it. Bad for your immune system. 
$C: I have met zero people who ride regularly who have not had accidents.

This, along with living in Miami, has deterred me from learning to ride.

Even my father, who spent his entire youth riding in upstate New York, owned several bikes, and participated in the famed Crotana Midnight Run, gave up riding when he moved to Miami. I trust his judgement more than anyone's on this matter.
$C: In 30 years of riding, I've been in two accidents. Walked way from both. Yeah, they hurt but nothing terrible. In 30 years of riding, I've lost one friend. And had one friend lose a foot (but they reattached it)
$C: He's one lucky squid
$C: So worth it for the thrill of the road /s. I still love Keanu though 
$C: A good friend of mine was killed on a moped, driving sensibly.

My kids can smoke whatever they want, but biking is the one thing I'll forbid. One loss is more than enough.
$C: Sorry to hear that. I know a guy who lost his leg and like 4 others who have crashed.... So it's always seemed stupid to me tbh
$C: For me it was: 

0 to 24 - no interest in motorcycles

24 - 550cc

25+ - 900cc
$C: I got an 80cc, a Honda XR80 specifically, dirt bike when I was in - if I remember correctly - 3rd grade (US). Got it for Christmas. Upgraded to 100cc the next Christmas (mostly cause the 80cc was kinda a junk bike my dad had bought for $100 and spent maybe another $150 on to get in running condition). The jump from 80 to 100 is pretty negligible though, btw the 100 was a Honda XR as well. Just a bit newer and in better condition from the get go. 

Christmas when I was in 6th grade (seems like it actually ended up being about February because we were looking for an appropriately priced and in good condition model) I jumped to an XR250. Not *super* powerful, but a jump from a kids bike to a *man's* bike. I could just barely stand up on my tip toes on it. I remember crashing it at least 3 times the first full day of riding I took it on. My biceps, shoulders, all the way down my chest to my pectoral muscles were sore just from trying to *hang on* to the damn thing when I cranked the throttle. But man I loved that bike. Rode it until I was something like 23 years old when I finally blew the engine. Those old dry sump Honda 4-strokes were almost bulletproof. 
$C: I learned on a 250 over a weekend at a BRC course and then went straight to my 984cc V-Twin with 92 horsepower. Higher powered or heavier bikes are tougher to handle but the rider is the more important factor.

Hell, I passed my test at the DMV on that big bike. The tester said, "you know that these aren't good for this test, right?" I said yes and then passed on the first try with no problems anyway.

Just be honest with yourself. Stay within your limits and ride what suits you.
$C: I just went balls deep at 20 and bought a 600rr. Sold it a few years later for a vtx 1300c, I personally like cruisers now a bit more.
$C: 5- small 3 wheeler, 8- mini bike, 12-125cc, 14 250cc, 16- 400cc, 18- 600cc 
$C: I passed my unrestricted license recently at the age of 27. Every time I think about getting a bike, I read more people say that I'm definitely gunna die, so I've never quite made to actually getting one.
$C: That seems like a logical fallacy to me. The fact that you're more likely to die from other stuff is irrelevant to the fact that you can get hurt really badly on a motorcycle. Regardless, I don't eat McDonald's. That shit is gross 
$C: Yeah but I'll pass on the ruptured speen my guy 
$C: Yeah it's easy to underestimate just how tiring it can be to have the wind hitting you
$C: Hey, I like that book.
$C: Justin Bieber is Canadian too. 
$C: Toronto. His transformation took place in Toronto. Can never be too weary of that place.
$C: Whoa.
$C: Where's 
$C: What? What?
$C: Are you sure? 
$C: I dont think Keanu has boobies.

$C: TOTALLY NOT A ROBOT MOTORCYCLE
$C: BEEP BOP BOOP!
$C: Exactly what a robot would say. 
$C: Not gonna fall for the banana in the tail pipe, ehh?!?

$C: Way to start off the day friends. Be excellent to each other.
$C: Thanks dude! Much appreciated! :)
$C: Hey you seem great, have a great day!
$C: Feliz Navidad! 
$C: My heart is in Havana :(
$C: And you as well...


...you owe me one.
$C: Felize Navidad
$C: You two cut this out right now.
$C: It was my name on Xbox Live for years, it was meant to be Dunkster_P but I screwed up. I was known as Dunksterp, Dubsterp, dunkstep.... the list goes on. Always made me laugh so I never changed it.
$C: If it is, then I probably need to apologize for all the times I've posted [this gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/ToMjGpnXBTw7vnokxhu/giphy.gif).
$C: It's cool when a stranger tells me I'm awesome if it's genuine. Usually after having a real conversation there will be something like "been great talking to you, you're an awesome guy, have a nice day!" But when there's no conversation going on and just randomly out of the blue says it, it makes me sad. Especially when it comes from a novelty account purely for that purpose.
$C: You and I could be good friends
$C: Exactly. It‚Äôs painfully obvious they only do it so they can pat themselves on the back. But as soon as you mention that, they get defensive about it. ‚ÄúI was being kind, fuck me, right?‚Äù I don‚Äôt have a problem with people being kind, obviously, it‚Äôs the lack of sincerity behind it that bothers me. They‚Äôre all copy/pasted versions of what some other person said. ‚ÄúBe happy and smile :)‚Äù seems like one step short of ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre depressed? Have you tried not being depressed?‚Äù 

Also somewhat related: how is a picture of a dog being a dog automatically wholesome? Can someone please explain that? 


$C: That's not what they asked
$C: This is so disingenuous 
$C: You're*
$C: Stop picking on me. :/
$C: Leave my dyslexia alone!  lol, I fixed it...
$C: Yeah, it comes off as super fake.
$C: I mean, I don‚Äôt think anybody posts on Reddit because they don‚Äôt want to be noticed.
$C: Hmm, yes it can be under the pretense of sarcasm, otherwise it backfires and it also requires social cues often difficult to convey via text. 

The key to trolling is to make yourself feel better...and you do that by making others feel worse. 

It‚Äôs sort of like wealth distribution. You see, being rich has nothing to do with how much money you have...it‚Äôs about how much money you have compared to everyone else that matters. 
So being better off than others is equivalent to others being worse off than you. Materials and technology are nothing more than circumstantial and must be put into context. 
$C: Wow, good one. Your so smart.
$C: That was beautiful. That took character to do. Thank you for inspiring me to continue despite the naysayers.
$C: I'm a fan of Kraut space magic, myself.
$C: I believe the term is paradox
$C: yea but they also live at all locations at all times. If you look close enough they are inside of each and every one of us.
$C: They are the source of gravity on Earth. 

If they were in the same place it would be akin to dividing by 0.
$C: > It would be cataclysmic.

Duh, what do you think caused the Big Bang?
$C: I love your sense of coolness, Keanu, Murray and Pratchett, all in same sentence.
$C: They are the source of gravity on Earth. 

If they were in the same place it would be akin to dividing by 0.
$C: DONT CROSS THE STREAMS!
$C: Didn't Bill Murray beat the shit out of his ex wife or something 
$C: Lemme write that somewhere, anyone know how to get hold of Bill Murray and Keanu Reeves?
$C: Unless you have [photographic evidence](http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/celebrity/no-one-will-ever-believe-you-photo-evidence-of-ultimate-troll-bill-murray-stealing-french-fries-finally-surfaces).
$C: Was he naked? Sounds like something he'd do whilst hanging brain. 
$C: Nobody believed you. That's why
$C: Most celebrities tip well, and going against his on-screen personality, was lucky enough to be working a night Conor McGregor was in the club I worked at, his security was understandably very tight, but the man himself was an absolute gentleman, got a photo with any of the staff that asked and tipped every one of us who were at his table, unfortunately didn't get a photo with him but all of our hostesses managed to and got tipped very well that night. Also that man can put away Jameson like it's water. 
$C: üòõüòõüòõüòõüòõ
$C: It's exaggerated, sure, but it's actually very much on point. 

Because I know about you just as much as you know about Keanu Reeves on this point. He has expressed no feelings towards fans approaching him one way or the other (that I know of) 

I repeat: I know your intentions are good, but you are giving advice out of pure and utter ignorance. Never do that.
$C: Holy shit that's adorable. Makes me love both of them even more.
$C: So does Harv-

Wait, modern times.
$C: Sure, why not 
$C: Thanks for that. Never knew about that area. 
$C: Norton AntiVirus is an anti-malware software developed and distributed by Symantec Corporation since 1991 as part of its Norton family of computer security products. It uses signatures and heuristics to identify viruses.¬†

$C: They're heavy by today's standard. Weren't really that beefy for the time period.
$C: My Samsung doesn't like me typing strange words. 
$C: You know, some people have the juice, but only few have the sauce. If this guy has a Norton Commando, he does have the sauce.
$C: The have bushings that isolate the engine transmission and swing arm. Put them back wrong or too loose and the handling goes to shit. 
$C: And very, very beautiful, sigh. (Talking about the bike but could double for Keanu)
$C: Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, Thomas Edison invented the lightbulb, Joseph Lucas invented the short circuit.

Did you know Lucas invented intermittent windshield wipers?  And intermittent headlights, intermittent stereo, intermittent alternator...

Bet you never knew that LUCAS is actually an acronym:  Loose Unsoldered Connections And Splices

In an effort to diversify their product lineup, Lucas began making vacuum cleaners in the 1970s.  It was the only thing they made that didn't suck

Why is there no death penalty in England?  Lucas made the electric chairs
$C: Yeah, and don't get me started on the prequel trilogy.
$C: I'd put money in the opposite. That's a bike that you keep stock.
$C: I put electronic ignition in my ‚Äò67 BSA Lightning j restored last year. You would never know unless you took the points cover or seat off, and if someone cares fuck them because I want to ride my bike. Electronic ignition is the way to go as far as I‚Äôm concerned, unless you have a super rare 1 of bike. That should probably be restored back to the way it left the factory floor and not touched. 
$C: "the Combat engine & disk brake were such a popular item that by mid-year, they were included on every 1972 Norton Commando of every type.¬†"

So it could be a combat, or not, but I'm going to agree with you because Keanu looks like he'd go for a combat engine! 

Back in the day I owned an 850 in a '71 frame with the TLS front drum brake, followed by a stock 850 mk IIa with a disc, and I'd take that drum over the disc every time. Set up correctly it would stop me on a sixpence, and the air scoop and "exhaust" mesh covered holes in the drum were a thing of beauty.

Interesting read about the Combat problems: 

http://www.classic-british-motorcycles.com/1972-norton-commando.html
$C: Thanks for the correction of the year. 

We have a commando 750, and it is most definitely not GP shift. My CBR is though!
$C: You still got it Michael
$C: One
$C: Two
$C: Three
$C: And finally, number four.
$C: Keanu was staring too, that's why he made the "blouse" comment to play it off.
$C: Oh nice! I‚Äôd be interested so see what a Combat-engined one would be like to ride. I know they‚Äôre supposed to rev higher, which is always fun, but I imagine it‚Äôd lose some of that characteristic grunt...
$C: No need to buy. Just get on your knees, open your mouth, and browse r/all
$C: That‚Äôs fake news. No doctor could remove his spleen and live to tell the tale.
$C: I don't know who Cobra Commander is or what his voice sounds like. One day, hopefully, you will mature. And one day, hopefully, you will understand why it's important not to be a tool of those who would manipulate you.
$C: That‚Äôs along the lines of what I was thinking. Maybe a soon to be announced movie or something.
$C: [removed]
$C: These are all men so far!
$C: in the marines 
$C: We'll retire the #1 when Tom Hanks dies...
$C: You rang???
$C: I think he‚Äôs only become a ‚Äúcelebrity‚Äù because of how much people hate him. I was thinking more along the lines of entertainment industry celebrities. 
$C: Nothing really, reddit is fickle and got sick of her personality.
$C: She got upset about her nudes being leaked, which reddit had a huge part in sharing them. That's literally it.
$C: "Hi"
$C: Looks like he's one of those /r/MGTOW types. What he said is probably exactly what he means; the fact that she spoke at all is what soured his opinion.
$C: [I found this interview pretty shitty on her part](https://youtu.be/2y7rk7eHHAM) 
Then there was her coming out against Weinstein despite pics of her embracing him on the red carpet. 
She‚Äôs no Bill Murray that‚Äôs for sure. 

$C: No don't do it
$C: I want to see the original comments the guy made.
$C: https://imgur.com/a/slHXS

Used Internet Archive to recover the original comments that were deleted.
$C: I wonder if he has a social media person who just searches for people talking about him. 

‚ÄúArnie, some guys on reddit are talkin shit, get in here!‚Äù
$C: ‚ÄúAre you sure about that?‚Äù

I like how both the user account and the comment he‚Äôs responding to is deleted.

Wonder what happened to him.
$C: Here's the thing...
$C: People here seem to only shit talk those who can't do anything back. Spez still runs the show unfortunately so
$C: Your research lacks credibility, sauce?
$C: I know you're half-joking, but I don't think /r/gonewild and associated subreddits exist to cater to hot women... For every submitter, there's like dozens or hundreds of commenters. That's a tough ratio to draw the conclusion from that there are relatively 'quite a few hot women redditors' 
$C: I was going to post almost the exact same comment.
$C: Such a sexy bike. Love old school cafe racers.
$C: A Norton like this one is on my Lotto bucket list.
$C: Norton‚Äôs, Indians, and Greavses just won‚Äôt do, no they don‚Äôt have a soul like a Vincent ‚Äò52
$C: When it's running sure.
$C: Unless you have a bad ground and it won't start no matter how many times you kick that stupid thing over in the rain on the side of the road. 

Better go with an 850 electric start...the electric start works about half the time anyways. 
$C: That‚Äôs my last name. I‚Äôm positive a few women out there would disagree. 
$C: Because he‚Äôs protected from viruses? 
$C: As long as you‚Äôve got the cash to pay for the inevitable repair bill. I‚Äôve got two 750s, and they can be motherfuckers to keep running. 
$C: Right! You gotta try being sad if your a rich celebrity living in LA! They can do whatever they want. Sounds like fun!!!
$C: Isn't riding a Norton kind of like driving a 1972 Volkswagen Karmann Ghia... not much technology, but cool as fuck? 
$C: You take your motorcycle into the urinal at a gay bar?
$C: I know, I can feel it
$C: Probably my favorite FG joke
$C: That's fair. I think some people really think he's a stalker, though, hahaha.

Me too! I love the Bill Murray "they'll never believe you..." stories
$C: Is it Keanu Day? Rusev might have need to have some words with him. 
$C: Speak for yourself
$C: /r/KeanuM
$C: Speak for yourself 
$C: GOOD point!
$C: Pastor says we should  always remember Keanu when we say our blessings.
$C: Speak for myself
$C: Can we celebrate world Keanu day this day every year? 
$C: Speak for yourself
$C: Speak for yourself 
$C: Especially my mom. She has him as wallpapers for her phone and her laptop.
$C: I wish.
$C: Speak for your self!
$C: We're gonna need you in 3...
$C: Or. . You could grab pussy and move on women like you are a bitch, lie endlessly, be senile and still be POTUS
$C: The incumbent u/ImTheDamnPresident is unstoppable. I'm gonna have to go with the time tested candidate that I *trust*.
$C: Why not a PR cat?
$C: No hablas muy tacos.
$C: And IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!!!! Will always love... yooooooooooou!
$C: https://youtu.be/fmh8a7aYc1s
$C: Meechum
$C: I choose to believe every word of this.
$C: Totally believable until "long story short." Bravo
$C: Oh man, that reminds me of the time I met Keanu at a hospital in Pittsburgh.  We were there to see a Steelers game, and on the way into the stadium my mom slipped and broke her ankle.  She was in a lot of pain.  While we were in the ER, I looked over and saw that Keanu was there too.  I‚Äôm a big fan so I said hello and we started up a conversation.  After a few minutes he came over to my mothers bedside to introduce himself.  He asked what was wrong, and Mom told him about her ankle, which was really hurting.  Then he kind of looks around and asks mom if he can help.  Skeptical, she said sure, just thinking that he was talking about thoughts and prayers.  He closes the little curtain and puts his hands on Mom‚Äôs broken ankle. He closes his eyes, and suddenly this blue light starts coming from his hands.  He directs his healing powers into my mother‚Äôs ankle, and under the skin we can see the bones reconnecting and healing.  My mom started crying and speaking in tongues, but K remained steadfast.  30 seconds later she was completely healed and walked out of the hospital and got into the new car that K give us the keys to.  Turns out he was at the hospital to cheer up sick kids and he gave away all his organs that day.  
$C: Ok, at first I thought "eeeeh, bit long, not sure if I wanna spend time reading that" 

I'm glad I kept reading because boy was air blown out of my nose
$C: was hoping it was /u/shittymorph
$C: Thank you for making me burst out laughing in the crowded morning safety meeting.
$C: Expected another /u/shittymorph comment, was pleasantly surprised.
$C: Still a better love story than twilight
$C: Damn I made it to about 3 sentences to the end and knew it was going somewhere off the wall.
$C: I was like 90% sure this story was going to end with that damn announcer's table that Mankind plummeted through after the Undertaker through him off Hell in a Cell in 1998
$C: Isn't this the Shawn Michaels pasta?
$C: > six of the seven continents.

Which one did you skip?
$C: > on six of the seven continents

Liar. Keanu would never leave a continent hanging like that.
$C: And to you, Keanu Cleaves.
Until your heart Keanu Reaves, 
on the day Keanu Leaves. 
$C: Username checks out
$C: I liked the Mankind one more. 
$C: Been awhile since i been pulled into one of these. wp
$C: r/unexpected
$C: I was waiting for the classic shittymorph Hell in a Cell Mankind thing and was happy when I got to the end that I didn't get gotten.
$C: What a twist! I'm not even mad.
$C: Relevant username for this type of comment. Fantastic 
$C: I was totally expecting this to turn into Undertaker throwing Mankind 20 feet from the hell in a Cell. 
$C: Spit coffee all over my work computer. 

11/10, would read again.
$C: Thats a nice porn plot

$C: Something something "electrical infetterance"
$C: üòÇ 
$C: Always remember the context while you're reading a reply
$C: Why didn't you guys make love in Africa? 
$C: This is fantastic
$C: as a straight man from the midwest, I completely believe this. I don't even know what a French Riviera is.
$C: You are such a cool bastard...you had me hook line and sinker...ugh. 
$C: Thanks. My boss now thinks I‚Äôm trying to start a love triangle with you and Keanu...either that or I normally spit pizza and root beer out of my mouth.
$C: Wait a minute. I've read this EXACT story word for word except you claimed that it was Josh Beckett. I see what you're doing here. 
$C: I want to believe...
$C: Half way through, I thought this was ending with Undertaker and Mankind in 1998.
$C: I love that this style of commenting has evolved into anything from sea monsters, wrestling pay per views, to gay love novellas, keep em coming
$C: This is some weird shittymorph...

I'll take it 
$C: At the end I seriously said WHAT THE FUCK out loud. I'm in tears XD
$C: >  to make a long story short,

Too late!
$C: One sentence in.... *Checks last paragraph*... Okay good. No announcer tables, it's safe to continue.
$C: Couldn‚Äôt have done the seventh huh?
$C: Thank the gods I wasn‚Äôt shittymorphed
$C: I was waiting for this to turn into a tree fiddy story. 
$C: I believe all of what you said, but I think you're lying about Keanu approaching some strangers' table - he's far too polite to do so. Jelly of the lovemaking though.
$C: Then he dumped you. You now refer to him as the heartbreak kid. 
$C: Holy fuck lmao
$C: Nobody lets their crush into their creeper room, then they would know just how weird you are 
$C: That was a nice thought... .I always cringe when people "ask for a photo" or an autograph or some meaningless shit like that.

but sometimes I feel like it'd still be nice to have someone come up to you and say "Hey, I don't need a photo or anything...but I just really like your work, and it might not mean much...but I wanted you to know."
$C: Oh, that's in Hudson Sq. Sorry to pick hairs.
$C: Never forget.

$C: Maybe I'm getting old but for the longest time he was made fun of as a dorky one-note actor with no range. "Woah, man!" etc. John Wick seems to have completely changed his image.
$C: During the Sad Keanu days I think it was more of a joke, but people realized what a genuinely great person he was, and he made John Wick, and he became a hero
$C: Nah fuck that explanation. I want conspiracies!
$C: After all the gore, Keanu Heaves

$C: I ride a 600cc supersport and I don't actually stay well above the speed limit for more than a minute at a time. I love the acceleration more than the speed so my favorite thing is to accelerate really fast then just coast back down to the speed limit. And the cornering. Cornering at high speeds in a car feels scary, but on a bike it is amazing.

I bought my bike for $1,500. It looks like shit, but can do 0-60 in 1st gear in 3.5'ish seconds. I would be hard pressed to find a car that works for $1,500.
$C: turn that frown upside down...
$C: except for ... flying
$C: I‚Äôve also herniated my disc bro, fucking sucks. Haven‚Äôt been able to train back or legs properly ever since. Almost messed up my shoulder too but I switched to dumbbells for heavy compounds. I‚Äôm still more afraid of going at the limit on a bike than going to my limit at the gym tho 
$C: ATGATT
$C: Not as likely as it is from riding a motorcycle. 
$C: Watch the interview again, little fry guy. He believes they sewed his head up with ‚Äúhamster feet.‚Äù  Another good reason never to touch a motorcycle kiddos!  
$C: >whatever allows them to do it so inexpensively! 

They take it out of the road fund, eventually the potholes will be so big it'll be just another small hill to climb.
$C: I have looked at the grom! They're super cute but I want something with a little more long distance capability as my main. I've considered it for a second bike. My parents both have larger 1200-1300 cruisers and they are massively heavy. I've been looking at something like the Truimph Bonneville street twin. 29.5 inch seat height .. but really I need a 28" seat or lower to be comfortable. Otherwise I tend to not ride. 

Suprisingly a grom is a 28" seat height!
$C: Dress for the slide not the ride.
$C: Not having a lot of tire contact patch with the road isn't actually any sort of contributing factor in the majority of motorcycle accidents. Around 3/4 of accidents occurs because a car made a left turn in front of a motorcycle. The most dangerous part of riding a motorcycle is a combination of being less visible and people not paying attention to you. Then there's the factor of speed. A lot of riders I've talked to seem to treat speed limits as suggestions instead of laws. So combine excessive speed with a car turning in front of the rider, and the unwise decision of many of them to not wear and gear and you've just calculated up the large majority of fatal motorcycle accidents.

Statistically, riders who are geared up, attentive, and within reasonable speeds, are barely going to get into any more collisions, let alone fatal ones, as a driver.
$C: All of my friends that have motorcycles have crashed multiple times and/or been hit by cars. Some still ride. Others don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt ride not because I fear my own mistakes will kill me, but because of all the texters and drunks and uninsured horrible car drivers out there already. 

Edit: spelling
$C: Motorcycles are extremely stable. Gyroscopic forces are actively trying to keep the bike upright.

[The vast majority of motorcycle crashes are caused by other car drivers and of no fault to the motorcyclist, themself.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_findings_in_the_Hurt_Report)

Also saying "everyone will crash their bikes and usually will do it often" is extremely incorrect. I've been riding for a decade and have zero accidents, crashes, or close calls. I know several other bikers who are the same.

I get it. You think that all bikers are just like yourself. That's extremely flawed logic and self centered. Stop spreading misinformation.
$C: <everyone will crash their bikes and usually will do it often>

absolute nonsense


$C: > usually will do it often

How often is often (and how crash is crash)? I've dropped my motorcycle twice for about 8 years of riding. And it was at speeds slower than walking and was caused by slippery road on mud and tram rails.
$C: My brother has been riding for about a year and two months ago had his first wipeout. Like you said, nothing major, he just accelerated a bit to quickly where there was some fine particles under him and his bike just kicked out and he went skidding across. Scratched up his legs a good amount but nothing too damaging
$C: I will say the technology has made a hell of a difference. I have an 83 Honda 1100 inline 4 power cruiser and a 2016 V-twin sport bike. On the new bike I have about twice as much power, but also ABS, traction control, steering damper, great suspension, wheelie control... some of them now even have cornering ABS. This makes for a bike that does NOT feel twice as difficult to ride. 
$C: I had an accident on my motorcycle going 15mph max, slid on some gravel, broke my leg and spent 12 weeks unable to bear weight. 

There are many situations where you'd have a potential accident on a motorcycle that would never happen in a car, and for every car accident the same accident on a motorcycle would be far, far more dangerous. Wreck a car going 20 and you might have whiplash, wreck a motorcycle going 20 and you could have anything from skin ripped off half your body to permanent brain damage or death.

Riding a motorcycle is a lot of fun, but it's incredibly dangerous. Wear every bit of gear you can - full face helmet, abrasion-resistant jacket with elbow, shoulder, and back armor, abrasion-resistant pants with knee/hip pads, gloves with knuckle armor and palm sliders, and leather boots with a steel shank and ankle armor/support. Wear your gear all the time.
$C: A fair amount of bike accident are because he riders can‚Äôt take a corner at high speed ( quite often the bike can but the rider bails because of fear)  and  it‚Äôs also a good thing to remember a lot ( if not the majority) of  fatal accidents are because motorcycles are not as visible as larger vehicles, and car drivers pull out or turn in front of them , so heads up car drivers and look out for bikes turning across the road, and bike riders keep that thought in mind when turning across the road or passing any junction, especially just as you leave a built up area. Wear a bright yellow or orange helmet and clothes if you are concerned about being seen. Other than that bike are great!
$C: What? Do you even know what you're talking about?
$C: Cars also can't fall over. 

And can  only eject you if you're not wearing a seat belt. 
$C: it's not if you crash it's when.


$C: I know a guy that's had a Ducati for 2 years... he's had 9 incidents on his bike.  Only one was somewhat serious and he ended up going down doing about 60, caught some intense road rash.  The rest were all stuff that you can walk off or heal up in a couple weeks or damage to his bike.

I've been riding off and on for over 10 years and I've had one instance where my foot got pinned under a sliding bike, but my boot and riding pants took 90% of the damage.   One incident where a car darted over one lane to get in the right hand turn lane, didn't see me coming up and sideswiped me onto the sidewalk.  Didn't actually crash but he bent my handlebars and sent me careening across a sidewalk at 25mph that could've had pedestrians on it (didn't at that moment).  The rest of the stuff was me dropping my bike or bailing out of wheelie in a parking lot when I was learning.
$C: > nothing you will die from

Except when you do.  There is a reason ER workers call motorcyclists organ donors. 
$C: Eh, a lot of people who get into riding are morons and kind of have it coming. Especially in the US where there's very little regulation on required training, which bikes you're allowed to buy, and the gear you're required to wear. In this country it's legal for a 16 year old to buy a 200mph Hayabusa and ride it around in shorts and a T-shirt (and without a helmet in some states). In Europe "bikers" don't have quite the same reputation as they do in the US because of education and regulation. 
$C: There are only 2 kind's of people who ride motorcycles. Those who have crashed and those who will.
$C: drive safely mate, buy body protection, never push too hard, respect speed limit.
$C: Similar here. First bike at 22 was 660, 4 years later and I feel comfortable enough to get a 1700. Gets out of the shop next week, I'm unbelievably excited. It's like sitting on a bison comparatively. 
$C: you're talking about single cylinder cross bikes, those are nasty, their acceleration is hard to compensate, most people end up doing wheelies and crashing eheh... sadly i never had one of those; only 2 or 4 cylinder engines (moto guzzi v50 III '83, moto guzzi 1000 sp '85, BMW k100 '87)
$C: exactly that. But not many people are capable to do what you did, some people get slightly more confident and... boom. 
$C: with cruiser you often have to play strategy before agility. Not always easy.
$C: with these specs, i expect you to be a racer guy! i have couple friends who did this kind of progression, and sometimes when we meet to do mini-bike races for fun, i can't keep their peace, they just have better trust of the tires and usually know pretty much how to draw lines better than me.
$C: you have just to keep practicing. When i started i was afraid to death so i tried to not push to the limit; i knew my limit was up there somewhere, but i was afraid to test it, because when you reach it, it's too late and you are flying on the asphalt (happened couple times at 14-16 yo, once at 18 on ICE, ice is terrible, and at 24 yo, i was speeding and a car made a mistake pushing me few centimeters off the road, nothing serious, was lucky; you don't only need to know how to ride the bike, you have to learn even how to fall from it, that's crazy i know, but it's true)

$C: That's incorrect.  I hope nobody sees this post and if they do I hope they look away and forget it ever happened.  
  
*don't forget to smash those like and subscribe buttons...
$C: It's not about feeling better, it's about enabling a sense of power in one's self. You can feel pretty fucking shitty, but if you have power it helps distract from that. It all boils down to just inciting a reaction, whether negative or positive, because that gives a sense of control over others.

$C: In 1859 Joshua Norton became absolute ruler of the United States when he declared himself "Norton I, by the grace of God Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico"
$C: Edward Harrison Norton (born August 18, 1969) is an American actor and filmmaker. He has been nominated for three Academy Awards for his work in the films Primal Fear (1996), American History X (1998) and Birdman (2014). He also starred in other roles, such as The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996), Fight Club (1999), Red Dragon (2002), 25th Hour (2002), Kingdom of Heaven (2005), The Illusionist (2006), Moonrise Kingdom (2012), The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) and Sausage Party (2016). He has also directed and co-written films, including his directorial debut, Keeping the Faith (2000). He has done uncredited work on the scripts for The Score (2001), Frida (2002) and The Incredible Hulk (2008).

$C: Sorry, I don't know a whole lot about vintage bikes so I just assumed he'd update the electronics for convenience sake. 
$C: My 72 Commando came pre modified, so redoing the electronics was a given. Plus I wanted to ride it, not just stare at it
$C: >And if someone cares fuck them

The only way to live life
$C: From the factory, If it's a 750 with a front disc brake, it's a 1972 Combat.  They didn't make 750s after 1972, and they didn't put disc brakes on any Commando before 1972. These British manufacturers were known for improving a model half way through the year instead of waiting till the next New year's model.  So yes, there could be a 1972 750cc with no disc brake, but it wouldn't have the Combat engine.  All commandos previous to 1973 are 750cc, your 1971 must've been swapped with an 850. 
$C: Does your Commando have rear sets? In that case the shift lever would be pointing backwards so your toe could reach it, and that reverses direction of the pattern. Every 750 Commando came from the factory with GP shifting pattern.  Yours could also be modified, they do make reversed cam plates for the gearbox so you can shift 1 down 3 up.  
$C: That was my one of my buddy's, he had a Quaife close-ratio gearbox in it.

Hard to tell if it lost anything much on the bottom end that the different ratio on the first two gears didn't compensate for.
$C: What if you don‚Äôt have knees? Seems like a pretty racist policy.

i heard he gave away his organs to kids dying of bad organ disorder and to this day he walks around with bionic organs and his blood is jet fuel and he breathes napalm or something.     
$C: And that reminds me of this NSFW story with Keanu:
  
She slowly licked and tickled his peeny, and because she was so smart, combined the words in her head, like an expression explorer of old.
Slickled, she thought. I'm slickling his peeny.
No matter how brilliant her wordplay, the result was the same. Keanu‚Äôs peeny was now erect. It felt like a quality bar of peeny-scented soap in her hands. Without warning she gave it a swift headbutt, because men liked that. All men liked that.
"Phwoa, Melinda. That's the good stuff. That's the stuff that makes me forget about my problems."
Melissa derived satisfaction from this comment, despite the mangled pronunciation of her name. She could feel her horny levels rising to 30% and her hooha was getting right slimy with anticipation of participation.
"Keanu, me need sex now inside please." Damn! Melissa thought. I wish there was a better way to say that!
Keanu was only too eager to comply. He wrenched his peeny away from Melissa's grubby paws and thrust inside her hooha with a thunderous orgasm. She was pregnant, but that could be dealt with in the morning, provided she was still alive.
"Outstanding stuff, Melanie," Keanu chortled. "I know I could just go to sleep now, but I would like to continue satisfying you, sans peeny." Keanu nudged downward and his peeny was nowhere to be seen.
"What in have you mind eeeeeee?"
"Just sit back and relax, kitty cat."
Melissa did just that , falling back onto the bed and stretching her "perfect 7" body, eager for Keanu‚Äôs attention. He started working his magic immediately and she felt an all too familiar heat rising from her breast. Keanu was crouched over top and pooping all over her unbelievably average body.
"Keanu, so stinky."
"That's just the poop, baby. Let it just work its magic."
"I... I can't see anything."
"that's because you're blind now, Mildred."

$C: I met /u/eneah at a restaurant once - we‚Äôd accidentally been given his table. Apparently he was fond of the restaurant and had a specific table he liked, and the management had messed up and gotten their days wrong, (it was Tuesday and they thought he was coming on Thursday or something like that). Anyway, the manager, completely embarrassed (this is a pretty nice restaurant) comes by and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, but we‚Äôd like to move you to another table if you could be troubled, and we‚Äôll gladly compensate you for the cost of the meal and any other meal you‚Äôd like while you‚Äôre in town.‚Äù My sister and cousin were both like ‚ÄúYeah that‚Äôs cool.‚Äù and I kind of played the asshole a bit. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I just don‚Äôt understand. We‚Äôve been here for 15 minutes - we‚Äôve just ordered. Can‚Äôt we finish our meal here?‚Äù Then out of nowhere /u/eneah/ shows up next to the manager and says ‚ÄúPaul, these guys can finish. We‚Äôll be at the bar. I got some time.‚Äù And I (being a big reddit fan) said ‚ÄúOh wow, uh‚Ä¶ I had no idea. Please feel free to give them the table.‚Äù /u/eneah was grateful, shook my hand and said thanks, then gave me a card with his number on it and told me to give him a call later. After working up the nerve, I gave him a call that night, and to make a long story short, we had a glorious 11 month love affair, man on man, that I shall never forget. Our bodies intertwined as one, and from the beauty of Morocco, to the French Riviera, to the snorkeling in the Galopagos, /u/eneah/ and I made glorious gay love to each other on six of the seven continents.

$C: It's not a conspiracy that a celebrity hires people for PR and social media, I'm sure it's pretty cheap sense posting a Reddit post is free. Maybe his PR is jus lucky that Reddit loves him so much but that love was earned so the stuff they post gets a lot of attention. He overcame a lot of shit and seems like one of the most genuine, honest guy in Hollywood. Plus John Wick was a refresher from all of the lite-action movies we have been getting but let's not forget that a movie us more than its main actor, there is the director and the writers and a whole lot of other people but the director and writers make it what it is for the most part. They usually decide when to cut a shot, on a good film set the director should be am autuer and make the say, the editor uses their discretion sometimes but the director should be involved because the vision can only be expressed originally and coherently by one person because it can only be comprehend entirely narrativly and artisticly in a single mind.

$C: After closing his eyes, Keanu Sleeps. 
$C: And around this point in the thread I forgot his real name.
$C: People downvoted my comment and now Keanu Weeps.
$C: No
$C: Morpheus?
$C: Can't speak for this guy...

But my dad would pick me up in full leather, rocking the foot-long beard, on his old shovel head. He was a dick. 
$C: Found the aviator
$C: I've flown before. Also skydived. It doesn't feel like you would think in your head it would. Motorcycle does more imo. 
$C: Yea, my ankle hurts constantly cause of disk. I started doing core stuff all the time along with stretching and it's made a huge difference. I went from 4/10 pain everyday for months on end to being at like a 1. Granted the 1 doesn't go away ever but it's a lot better than it was.  For my shoulder it was the flat bench that really got me. I was getting microfractures in my collarbone cause of the weights (it's called weight lifters shoulder) so they sawed off a chunk of my collarbone. While they were in there they also fixed my labrum but that was a rugby issue I think.  I'm about 5 months post surgery now and I did dips for the first time this past week without pain in like 2 years. It was awesome. 

The only place I ever go near the limit on for the bike is at the track. And I'm not really worried about wrecking there. The amount of gear you have to wear is pretty insane. Plus there's always a run off at the track. 
$C: If you remove the drunk riders, the people without training, and those who don't wear helmets you are about as statistically likely to get hit by a car on a motorcycle as you are a pedestrian crossing the street. They aren't so far off. I ski too. Also more statistically likely to get me injured than my motorcycle. Doesn't stop me on either. Everyone draws their line for risk at some point. 
$C: Yep, ATGATT. I love this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dF32JYCJPw) for how succinctly it shows why it matters.
$C: I'll just stick to my 4 wheel minimum.
$C: Less tire contact is the main cause of most accidents on motorcycles. It's why they are unstable and why any little thing you run over wrong can cause you to go into a slide and crash.

You are misinterpreting the information correctly. The factors you lay out are the reasons for why motorcycles are so deadly in motor vehicle collisions. All of those contribute to that lethality and is true. However motorcycles and the riders crash a lot more than just the collisions you are thinking of and those crashes I am referring to don't go reported since they are one-party incidents and not very serious. Lack of sufficient tire contact has everything to do with those.
$C: That's why I quit riding. You can minimize all of your mistakes and still get clipped badly by just about any and everything. A small puddle or a drunk can take you out of the picture and it was just too much to worry about.

Maybe someday once I get my adamantium skeleton I'll buy another bike.
$C: Gyroscopic forces surely aren't relevant else it would be really hard to move the handlebars. Bicycles stay up because of small movements of the steering (steering into the fall). My guess is the same for motorbikes
$C:  If you read your link, you would see that 2/3 of 3/4 or 1/2, aka 50%, are the fault of someone else. The other 25% involved another car but was the motorcyclists' fault. So half, not a vast majority.  
$C: bullshit. This is what people who have crashed say to make themselves feel better
$C: Hold up. You've never had road rash? You've literally never skidded out? I feel like you've got to be ignoring a few times by way of dismissive logic "it wasn't my fault." "I did it intentionally to avoid an accident" etc.

I could totally be wrong, but you'd be the first I've ever heard of to ride a bike for a while without ever having any of that. In which case, good on you, mate
$C: It's okay, I get it. My username must be relevant for you.

Motorcycles will self correct quickly, but they fall easily. The lean in turns can easily turn into a slide which will toss the rider and have the bike restabilize without them due to the gryoscopic forces. Those forces have nothing to do with making motorcycles "stable" as far as the rider is concerned. 

If you really are a rider, then I have news for you. You will crash. It's coming for you, even if you are lying through your teeth saying it hasn't happened to you yet. You can't avoid or factor in everything that can go wrong. You will slip up or someone else will. 


$C: That's often to me. Or 2 times a year or so, especially when starting out. Luckily it always seems to be at slow turns from water or oil and not something high speed.
$C: Yeah, ABS would be a night and day difference for a lot of riders. The difficulty in having to alternate braking is just too much for a human to handle in the split seconds you have when something jumps out in front of you. It's so easy to enter a power slide from instinctively yanking the breaks and forgetting to alternate the front and back levers and ABS would be such a necessary upgrade to make riding safer. Traction control sounds like it would be incredibly helpful as well, but I have no idea how that is handled on a motorcycle
$C: > Riding a motorcycle is a lot of fun, but it's incredibly dangerous.

Yeah, as much fun as it seems, I could never get myself to ride one. I could be the most defensive rider out there, but still end up disfigured, in constant pain, paralyzed, or dead simply due to the inattention of a driver. 
$C: Yeah, I get what you're saying. I feel like I'm old enough now to be sensible and not think about riding at or beyond my limits. I also live in a huge city where it wouldn't actually save me any time on a motorbike vs. a bicycle (which I ride daily), so it would only be for the weekends really. I'll get around to getting one eventually, maybe a ~300-500cc.
$C: Yeah fair enough. It's just not for me I guess

$C: Google "Lucas electronics jokes", there are hundreds of them lol

[This one](http://www3.telus.net/bc_triumph_registry/smoke.htm) is a classic, somebody listed a jar of "Lucas Replacement Wiring Harness Smoke" on eBay.  The bidder Q&A is where the real gold is.

Q: Will this smoke kit also stop oil leaks on British cars?          
A: No, nor will it bring about Middle east Peace. Some things just ain't going to happen, my friend.

Bonus joke: Why don't the British build computers?  They couldn't find a way to get them to leak oil.
$C: They were used on most British cars when I was growing up.  I don't know how far they go back, but I think most British cars of the 60s and 70s that I had any dealings with had Lucas electrics.  

We like to poke fun at them - and did so even back then.  For instance, in my part of the world the Lucas 7" sealed beam headlights were usually referred to as "Lucas glow-worms" on account of the feeble amount of light they put out - though in reality they were really only seen as bad when halogen lights appeared on the market.  And whilst by modern standards the Lucas electrics of the day were a bit unreliable, I'd much rather have Lucas electrics than what they put into many Italian and French cars of the same era!
$C: It depends a bit on the owner. Personally, I keep my old bikes as close to original as possible.

The Lucas parts of this era weren't terrible if you made sure that all of the connections and contact points were clean and in good shape.

That said, it's never a bad idea to carry spare condensers and one or two other odds and ends.
$C: it was swapped, yes. I had an 850 engine in a 71 frame with the twin leader brake
$C: The pegs are standard, only one set, and the shifter is in front of them, toe controlled.

Maybe it was modified prior to us owning it. I'll have to do some research on the guts next time we are in there
$C: That‚Äôs interesting. Mine‚Äôs just an incredibly grunty engine, and I can‚Äôt imagine one being any different. It‚Äôs a 44-year-old machine so I don‚Äôt feel the need to rev it too high, although perhaps with its shorter stroke the Combat might rev a bit more freely. Do you remember if the vibrations were less severe with the 750? The 850 is pretty violent haha. 
$C: Me 2 thanks

$C: Am a woman, know what a norton is, and would sell a kidney on the black market for the right bike.
$C: Yeah. I enjoy them both but have always had more issues with those and Triumphs than I'd care to mention. Another issue is parts availability. That's one of the things I mention whenever people just starting out riding talk about how much they want a vintage British bike. Where you gonna get that part you need when you eventually break down far from home. Ride long enough and it'll happen regardless what you're sitting on. Harley and Honda for my money. 
$C: Everywhere. 
$C: Oh so it's the bike that's gay, makes sense now.
$C: yeah I'm not serious, but I get a lot of amusement from people who ask what kind of motorcycle I ride, after seeing me carrying a helmet around. I just tell them nah man, it's a scooter. They go "Oh..." every time.

$C: ATGATT : All The Gear All The Time for those who are too lazy to Google.
$C: I have a 8 wheel minimum. Rollerskate or die 
$C: From what I remember of the statistics in my MSF course, the majority of one-party accidents are actually caused by entering a turn too fast. Gravel and other things do cause accidents, but it's relatively low compared to other factors like entering a turn with too much speed and target fixation.
$C: Source?
$C: Same here! Been looking for one on amazon and they are still too expensive. 
$C: The forces that apply to motorbikes are the exact same forces that apply to bicycles. That's why for motorbikes you effectively cannot turn the handlebars more than a degree or two above 35 km/h or so.

Yes, "steering into the fall" is a correct-ish way to talk about at-speed countersteering. Which is necessary and possible because of said stability from the gyroscopic forces from the wheels and engine.

[Countersteering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C848R9xWrjc)

Once you get a bicycle up to those speeds you effectively cannot turn the handlebars either and instead start using countersteering rather than turning the handlebars.
$C: Your both right for your given domains. 
Below a certain speed (usually quoted as 15-23mph) the motorcycle will behave like a bicycle (push to steer). Over that speed the gyroscopic forces of the wheels turning will tend to push the bike back upright when it is leaned into a turn. A motorcycle is much easier to control at faster speeds because then your counter-steering (you pull the handlebar on the same side as you turn). 
$C: I've never gone down, at all, ever.

I ride defensively and endeavor to stay actively aware of my surroundings. And I usually ride a 90 hp naked sport bike. My "chicken strips" are about 1.5cm as well.

A lot of people just aren't careful or get complacent. Part of my staying upright for so long is luck, sure. But the rest is me being a careful rider. Even so I always ride in 2 piece leathers, a SNELL helmet, boots and armored gloves. I've known a couple of people who have gone down. Thankfully I haven't as of yet. But if I do I'll be as protected as I can be.

Yeah, though, thanks. I hope that things stay this way.
$C: Seek help
$C: >If you really are a rider, then I have news for you. You will crash. It's coming for you, even if you are lying through your teeth saying it hasn't happened to you yet. You can't avoid or factor in everything that can go wrong. You will slip up or someone else will.

weird 
$C: How is this different from scratching your car's bumper every now and then? My car damage costs (like scratched bumper or worn suspension) are a lot higher than motorcycle ones and I mostly ride, for example.

Crash is a loud word for someone outside a motorcycle world.
$C: On mine it also has a "rain mode" where it's limited to 100hp and has more aggressive traction control, and relaxed throttle response. Pretty amazing really.

$C: You're right about drum brakes sometimes being better than discs. I race a 1960 650 Norton Atlas with a John Tickle front drum and I have almost dumped it at low speeds in the paddock.  At speed, I can grab it all and it won't lock up....they work if set up correctly. 
$C: The 750 was relatively smooth compared to the stock Commando, but that motor was completely balanced. 

I still remember how numb my hands used to get when out thrashing the 850.

The Combat gained revs like no tomorrow, and without a rev limiter I think you could spin it to destruction.

Did she really not call him out direct, or mention his name in statement of support for his victims (there must have been such a statement from her...right?)

The *new* Nortons can be had for about $18k and up, and they are absolutely gorgeous bikes. But it's just not the same as riding a vintage bike, they don't have the "soul" the old bikes have. There is just something about old bikes...

$C: That bit about it first being an ironic insult is apocryphal and, the fact that there is only one source of that, most likely wrong. 

No precursor or early period writings use the phrase in that manner. It wasn't until pop sci published it that it became "known." Of course, a small group of friends  may have said that, but the term wasn't in general or massive use in that manner.

Plus if it is a karma conspiracy it just means that more people will do it and then reddit will become a nicer place.

It's win win!
$C: That‚Äôs awesome, would love to try one one day. Which did you prefer, on balance? 

On tickover the 850 just jumps around on its stand ‚Äì the fairing on mine moves through a good inch or two on each stroke!

I know they did do a handful of Combat-engined JPSs...now that would be a sweet ride. 
$C: That site made it super easy so thank you!
$C: Having owned two original 850 commandos, I would have to agree about the "soul"
$C: They still break down just as much as the old ones though
$C: Thanks man at work can't be caught
$C: You took more time to do that than just state the answer...
$C: Yeah. My 83 Kawasaki KZ1100 is older than I am, but never leaked until I dumped it. 

I'm actually gonna buy my first brand new bike this year, but luckily for me I like Victory bikes a lot more than Harley's. 
$C: And NOBODY can have her.
$C: Will give gold if you run publicly. x3 if you post a video of you on the news for election reasons. x10 if you win
$C: You sound over qualified.
$C: Your campaign has written itself. *starts slow clap*
$C: Definitely sounds more qualified than the current president...
$C: [deleted]
$C: Hell I would vote for you. Or anybody else. Not like it could be much worse. At least you wouldn't have a giant network of business partners as well as 40 years of inflated ego to please. 
$C: [I like the sound of that!](https://youtu.be/zj0J-Uk5Iw4?t=53s)
$C: Oh my god, he shook my hand!!  Won't  wash it again!
$C: Let me know when you are ready, tiger! I also speak Spanish. Maybe, I could be your KellyAnne Conway? Currently registered as a Repub, but can change to Independent or Democrat if necessary.

$C: Reciting the national anthem "O say, Keanu seeee..."
$C: Jeez LoReeves you guys 
$C: Well actually I don't. My dad didn't dad very well either. 
$C: Fry guy, you‚Äôre missing the point. You‚Äôre a tiny fleck of porridge flying down the road. Hard to see you. Even mindful drivers make hard time finding your little motobike. Distracted driver never see it. Go boom on you. Then you‚Äôre Gary Busey. No fun. 
$C: So then  how do you come up with most motorcycle accidents being caused by a smaller contact patch of the tire?
$C: Thanks, I knew I butchered that explanation. I'll edit mine. 
$C: Your saying to push on the opposite bar then normal. It's still pull steer you just passing on the other side.

It is still a counter intuitive action.


$C: Turning on a motorcycle involves leaning the bike over sideways. Motorcycle tires are oval instead of flat bottomed like car tires to facilitate said leaning over. You'll only have wear on the rubber of the tire that actually touches the road.

This means that if you don't lean over very far the side edges of the tire will never touch the road. It takes skill and technique to lean the bike over enough to scrub the edges.

So, the far edges of the tire that never touches the road are called "chicken strips" to mock the rider for being too "chicken" to go into a far lean. [The unused parts of the tire are obvious when you look at it.](http://image.motorcyclistonline.com/f/features/columns/tread_envy_code_break/69090877+w620/MCY0514-CODE-2.jpg)
$C: You don't walk away with road rash from dumping it in a parking lot either.
$C: If road rash is the measure, I never crashed in 8 years. Neither most of my friends who are riders.
$C: It doesn't make you feel less good when you know the story is a lie? And that the user is playing off of people's emotions to generate traffic to their subreddit?
$C: That's a tough one.

That Combat motor was as far from  stock as could be, it had every fix done to it, it was basically a miler motor built by AMA pro Dougie Showler at his shop.

It was smoother than a either a factory 750 or 850, but then again (this was back in '74) it had over ten grand in it.

It howled. 





$C: I haven‚Äôt been there in a while, good to know it‚Äôs still user friendly!
$C: While unabashedly on Reddit...?
$C: Not sure which one you're gonna get but that Octane is a fast bike.
$C: Hmm.  I don't think I've ever been on the news and since I don't seek the camera I've noticed that any time a newspaper takes a picture where I'm volunteering I'm always just outside the picture frame. So....I fail. Sorry :(
$C: Based off where the bar is now I think someone who stayed at a holiday inn express last night is over-qualified. :-P
$C: Heh, I can do that.  

How about r/VoteMrPractical1 ?
$C: It would honestly be an honor to run.  My friends have all talked about it for years.  But there are lots of problems with that.  

* I was raised poor in a trailer pack and while I was able to bust my butt getting 2 degrees and have a good career I don't exactly come from money and a family name I can leverage.  My wife is a doctor but we have she is just started and has nearly $300,000 in student loans we have to pay off and b/c of the housing market in central Illinois my house has been on the market for about a year and a half without selling. Luckily I've always been very fiscally responsible so it's not limiting anything other than running for office haha.
* I'm not sure I have the temperament required to win a primary unless I just really thought the other candidates were irredeemably terrible.  I don't want to have to talk down about someone else just to push me up.  And outside looking in it seems like it takes that.  
* I'm somewhat risk adverse and running for office without coming from money is a big risk.  I used to be pretty actively politically when I was young often showing up for local party meetings and getting to know people.  I liked that we met at a union headquarters sometimes and other times at a bar. :)  But I haven't been involved much since I met my wife.  

But to be able to serve your fellow citizen in Congress or similar institutions is about the highest honor the people can bestow upon you.  I'd love to think I could help in that way eventually but I don't know.  Until then I'll keep fighting the good fight the same as all of you hoping we return to a less tribal culture.  I did a road trip to Jon Stewart and Steven Colbert's Rally to restore sanity back several years ago and loved it but it obviously didn't work lol.

Heh. someone asked me to create a sub so I did. :) https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteMrPractical1/
$C: Can you run in Canada as well? Our election is in 2019.
$C: If I ever run I expect it'll be as a Democrat with what the GOP appears to have become over the past decade.  It's a shame all the moderates have left. It's like why can't I be a deficit hawk AND believe we should live and let live? I know libertarians say that's what they are but they often come off as too impractical for my tastes so I guess it's Democrats.
$C: i can tell you don't dare do dad jokes outside the house

My French isn't very good though so Montreal may not like me...or maybe they will because I at least know some.  However, I typically say "Je parles pas francais."
$C: What do you consider impractical about libertarianism? Please don‚Äôt think that we are all fringe like the Anarcho-Capitalists and the other extremes like liberaltarians or conservatarians.

Most of us are just minarchists who want less government than we have now but understand that government is needed for some things that simply couldn‚Äôt be completely monitored by a free market.

Most of us are more worried about ending the war on drugs, stopping the war on terror, ending collusion between government and corporations, and generally enacting policies that would allow for markets to be both more profitable and easier to access.

You don‚Äôt have to be fringe to want more freedom.

$C: Well hey I have something to look forward to in life I guess 
$C: That's not a "no"! :D
$C: Ya, I think libertarians agree with me on many issues.  I'm very passionate about fighting against abuse of power whether it's federal or more local governments or even our law enforcement entities.  But then people with the last name Paul want to put us back on the Gold Standard which would more than triple the price of gold overnight and limit our ability to fight problems in the economy moving forward.  I actually only donated to one candidate in 2016, Gary Johnson, bc I wanted to get him into the debates...but his campaign fell apart under scrutiny and Trump was too dangerous not to vote for Hillary.  I feel like in the interest of supporting a 3rd party option people often are abdicating their decision making to others.  All the people who voted for Johnson or Stein in Wisconsin, Penn, & Michigan made the difference and as far as I'm concerned helped Trump win. :-\

I'd like to think libertarians would vote for me if I ever ran but they might not just because of me running under the umbrella of one of the main 2 parties. 
$C: Got a Mario amiibo and 2 Luigis
$C: Which if he drinks too fast, he will have a Keanu Sneeze

$C: Well i agree according to the Tao of Steve, That Keanu is a metaphorical Steve.  I Just wanted to Rhyme ;)
$C: Honestly in polls Johnson was pulling equal numbers from Dems and Reps. So he ‚Äòhelped‚Äô Trump just as much as he ‚Äòhelped‚Äô Hillary. The only person to blame for the election loss is Hillary. And the DNC that propped her up over Bernie. They had a candidate that all of their constituents loved and threw him under the bus with the promise of ‚ÄòI can beat Trump‚Äô.

Johnson isn‚Äôt to blame. He‚Äôs just one of many signs that people are fed up with the duopoly. Of the 3 political parties, Democrats and Republicans are losing numbers while the Libertarian Party is the only one that‚Äôs shown growth recently. 5 times in our 240 year history as a country. That‚Äôs how often a candidate has lost the popular vote and won the electoral. The first, in 1824 with John Quincy Adams was the end of the First Party System. The next two, 1876 and 1888 for Rutherford B. Hayes and Benjamin Harrison respectively, were near the end of the Third Party System. I believe the last two, 2000 and 2016 for Bush Jr and Trump respectively, are the end of the Sixth Party System.

Johnson‚Äôs campaign was stifled because right and left media companies targeted 2 or 3 specific examples of him being a ‚Äògoofball‚Äô. Hillary launched millions of dollars to smear the campaign of Johnson and the LP. She could have used that money for more exposure or promoting herself, but didn‚Äôt. I worked on helping with the Johnson campaign through social media and have helped other libertarian activities in my home state. There are a lot of great ideas with our party and truly millions of people and counting around the country who want to make things better. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôd rather stick with a different group which is dying.
$C: And a Link, Keanu sees

$C: You totally missed it. Should've been "Keanu Reprieves"
$C: A fall wreath Keanu weaves.
$C: To be clear I'm not blaming Johnson.  I'm all for getting your message out there and providing options. Hell, I was hoping because of Romney's relationship with Weld and hatred of Trump he'd show the courage to endorse the dual Republican Governor ticket. 

I'm just saying there was an opportunity cost to voting for Johnson and that cost was the opportunity to vote for the only person with a chance of keeping Trump out of office.  I wasn't willing to pay that cost.  Also I truly don't think he was as knowledgeable as Clinton on some really important issues despite my distaste for her. Now it's true judgment can make up for knowledge that only helps to a degree.
