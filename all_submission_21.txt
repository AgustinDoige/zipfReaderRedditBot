Scientist Stephen Hawking has died aged 76

$C: Favorite Hawking anecdote, from [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/14/stephen-hawking-professor-dies-aged-76):

>He began to use crutches in the 1960s, but long fought the use of a wheelchair. When he finally relented, he became notorious for his wild driving along the streets of Cambridge, not to mention the intentional running over of students‚Äô toes and the occasional spin on the dance floor at college parties.
$C: I wonder if any time travelers will come to his funeral.
$C: I didn't even realize he was that old! Completely shocked god damn
$C: Will always remember him from this from my childhood

RIP
$C: RIP to one of the greatest minds in the past century.
$C: For all the jokes made at his expense, this man was at the cutting edge of physics and our place in the universe. RIP and hopefully future explorations and discovery does your legacy justice.
$C: It's a shame but, I think he lived a very fulfilling life. He got an illness that usually kills most people in an incredibly short time, and then he lived out to a pretty healthy and average lifespan. All while being one of the most famous scientists of all-time, a person that was an inspiration and got so many others interested in science. 

I have nothing but respect for him, I don't think history will ever forget this man.
$C: "I‚Äôm not afraid of death, but I‚Äôm in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first."


Stephen Hawking
$C: Wow. This caught me off guard so hard.
$C: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge." Rest In Peace Mr. Hawking.
$C: deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.0434  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/69704)
$C: Absolutely gutted, what a man
$C: He was a man that truly changed the world and the way we look at the world.  
$C: There‚Äôs always those deaths where you read it & can‚Äôt believe that the news is real and this is one of them. Damn, RIP üôèüèº
$C: RIP to one of the smartest men in the world.
$C: We‚Äôve lost a true icon. 
$C: "Look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious"

$C: Is it weird to think he was gonna be like Christopher lee and just always be there? There is Hawking, in his chair. Almost unkillable.
$C: I was really not expecting this, nor was I expecting to be so emotionally impacted. 

Damn. 

Rest in peace.
$C: Even though he had a terrible disease, he still seemed to have an incredible amount of life inside of him. 

RIP
$C: I have to read a Brief History of Time again.
$C: He was given a life expectancy of 2 years in 1963, and died 55 years later. Dude probably outlived every single person involved in that diagnosis. Well played.
$C: This man made ALS his bitch for decades
$C: Man that's so sad. Stephen Hawkings was just one of those guys that I kind of never thought would die. To be as great and inspiring as he was with his condition takes true motivition.
$C: I was thinking the other day that I've been too young to see much history, all these geniuses I would read in textbooks had all died from hundreds to thirty years ago. Stephen Hawking though- one of the world's greatest minds- and I had the honor to have lived in his world.

I think the next few years in space exploration will do him proud, and I'm sure we will all wish he could stay to see them. 

I'm shocked 

Rest In Peace. 


$C: The fact he made it this far was remarkable and really speaks volumes about his inner strength and fortitude.

RIP. Hes one of the rare men you know will never suffer a second death. He will be remembered for generations. 
$C: End of an era. Holy shit. 
$C: Wow, Totally in shock.

I don't normally get affected by celebrity deaths, but this one gets me, because he still had so much to give. 

A fighter his entire life. His name will never be forgotten, going down with the likes of Albert Einstein.
$C: "I'm not afraid of death, but I'm in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first. "

~Stephen Hawking

Rest in peace, you will be missed.

$C: As a current physics undergrad, Stephen Hawking was one of the people that got me into this amazing field in the first place.
:(
$C: Thank you Mr. Hawking, you helped generations to wonder more. 
$C: I grew up in Cambridge and my mum always tells me the story of how I ran in front of him once when I was young and nearly made him go into a ditch. Sorry. RIP.


$C: The Theory of Everything is a great movie that details the life of Stephen Hawking, it gave me a whole new level of admiration for him because of everything he has endured. 
$C: Man, that's a tough one.

I honestly thought he was gonna make it to 100 at least, rocking some cyborg parts. 
$C: This is one of those deaths I knew had to eventually come but now that it's happened it doesn't exactly feel like it's actually happened. rip to a legend, one of the realest to ever do it
$C: "It would not be much of a universe if it wasn't home to the people you love." - Professor Hawking
$C: Statement: http://twitter.com/evanmcmurry/status/973767381431603206
$C: Damn, just kinda never expected. 
$C: He will go down in history as one of the world's most brilliant minds. In his memory, may more of his books be read.
$C: *‚ÄúWe are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special.‚Äù*

Thank you for helping us understand a little bit more...
$C: History will remember this man, he will not be forgotten
$C: World's lost one of its greatest people. Massive loss
$C: We've lost one of our greatest minds.  It's a sad day.  
$C: Died at the same age as Einstein. What a world.
$C: I love what Neil Degrasse Tyson once said: if aliens came to Earth and saw most humans like we see most gorillas, Stephen Hawking would be the Koko who was bounds above the rest of us despite his physical limitations. 

Almost a shame that the Tesla heading to Mars couldn't take him on the ride - would have been a fitting end to a man who broke scientific barriers from the confines of a wheel chair.
$C: Never thought he would've died this soon tbh 
$C: Without Stephen Hawking the universe we know would be vastly different and the intelligence of the world would be vastly lower. The world is darker now with his passing
$C: Oh wow. I knew he was sick, obviously, but this is still really shocking. 
$C: This is a huge loss for the scientific community. His work inspired generations to come. His legacy will never be forgotten. Thanks for everything, Stephen
$C: Greatest scientist since Einstein. He will be missed.
$C: I honestly didn't see this coming at all. The world has lost one of its most gifted minds. RIP
$C: Rest in peace to one of the greatest minds in history. He defied the odds for his entire life, and made the world a better place because of it. 
$C: Let's give a shout to his caretakers also. Can't have been easy. A man in his condition needed assistance. Because he had great help, and a great mind, he was able to do great things.
$C: On [Pi Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_Day), no less ‚Äî RIP.
$C: I feel like there will soon be a viral video of Neil deGrasse Tyson giving the most beautiful epilogue on Stephen Hawking and it‚Äôs going to make us laugh, cry, and once again remind us of our true place in this universe.
$C: A sad day for his family, science and education.

$C: Talk about out of the blue. One of the greatest Minds of our time is now gone. Gutted.
$C: He will be missed greatly. Hawking was unique, the definition of genius. What new insights have we lost?

My condolances to Lucy, Rob and Tim..and all that were privaliged to have shared time with professor Hawking.
$C: Mr. u/ElonMusk,  I ask that you name your next shuttle after Hawking
$C: A truly inspirational man who forever changed the world of science. 
$C: A remarkably long life for someone suffering MND. I'll shed a tear but at the same time smile for the wonder that you did for this world.
$C: Interview with John Oliver recently. 

"so proffessor, if there's an infinite number of universes, would that mean there is a universe where I am smarter than you"?

"yes. And also a universe where you are funny"

$C: Did the windows shutdown music play during his death?
$C: H-holy fuck, I... i'm speechless. Out of any famous person, this probably is hitting me the hardest. We've just lost one of the greatest minds of a generation. 

On a side note, I just realized that Mr. Hawking passed on Pi Day, kinda fitting.
$C: "So when a black hole disappears, according to what Hawking proposes,¬†information¬†is lost¬†forever, which is a problem, because quantum mechanics states that¬†information can¬†never¬†be¬†lost. Hence the paradox." Same paradox. You're gone, but you're not. Rest, Doctor.
$C: The fact that he lived so long with his disease is a credit both to modern medicine and to his sheer strength of will.
$C: For a guy with a 0 dex Score and a 0 strength score his constitution and intelligence score was out of this world. A sad loss
$C: We are lesser now with his absence. RIP
$C: The voice of a generation that came from a computerized voice. RIP.
$C: I wonder if this will push world leaders to reinvest in scientific advancement
$C: In 7th grade, A Brief History if Time changed the trajectory of my life. RIP Mr. Hawking, and thank you.
$C: Thank you, Dr. Hawking. Truly an amazing man. 
$C: This really made me tear up. I was already kinds sad just because of things unrelated to this, but hearing about this pushed me over the edge. 

RIP To Stephen Hawking. You shall live on forever in the minds of humans.
$C: An inspiration to all, not just to scientists.
$C: His voice was used in Pink Floyd's "Keep Talking".

Song will always give me chills, even though Dr Hawkings voice is taken from a cheesy commercial.

RIP you wonderful conciousness.

Edit: I'm listening to it now, RIP your genius voice, sir.
$C: >‚ÄúThere are three deaths. The first is when the body ceases to function. The second is when the body is consigned to the grave. The third is that moment, sometime in the future, when your name is spoken for the last time.‚Äù

>‚Äï David Eagleman

I feel that it's fair to say that Dr Hawking will live on for many more years to come
$C: Completely out of left-field, holy shit.

All the best to his family. He held some great achievements.
$C: A true inspiration to all of us. We lost one of our best today. Rest in peace, Professor Hawking.
$C: Rest in Piece, Mr. Hawking.  You taught the world so much.
$C: A truly inspiring person. RIP 
$C:  Wow. Completely unexpected. Will never forget what this dude accomplished, even with the disabilities he had to fight. What a legend. 
$C: One of the great minds of our time...RIP.
$C: A great loss for science and the world. However, considering that his condition was a very early death sentence, he lived a very productive live. 

RIP
$C: "It would not be much of a universe if it wasn't home to people you love" RIP to a true visionary 
$C: Well the world's IQ just dropped a few points
$C: Interesting coincidences between Galileo, Einstein, and Hawking:

Hawking's Birthday: **Jan 8th (1942)** (Exactly 300 years to the day after Galileo died)

Galileo's day of death: **Jan 8th**

Einstein's Birthday: **March 14**

Hawking's day of death: **March 14**

Hawking lived to be 76, Einstein 76 as well, and Galileo lived to be 77.

Don't know about you, but I found this kind of cool.


$C: Finally, he now knows all the answers. RIP. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Just when you thought the day was going to end on a good note...
$C: The collective IQ just dropped.. 
$C: Damn..truly one of the great minds of our time. 
$C: Rest easy dude. Rest easy 
$C: a great voice is silenced forever....
$C: Truly devastating. End of an era. 
$C: He lived for an extraordinarily long time with his disease and still managed to change the world. Rest In Peace, Professor Hawking.
$C: I thought he would have been the one to live forever
$C: "We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe and for that, I am extremely grateful."
$C: At least he got to play poker on the Enterprise-D.  I was shocked they left that out of the Theory of Everything.

RIP Stephen.
$C: An incredible man who defied incredible odds. RIP
$C: I didnt believe it when I first heard thr news.  He will be missed 
$C: So there goes my A.I. clone theory. 
$C: This is history in the making. May this pioneer of science rest in eternal peace.
$C: R.I.P. I love you. You will not be forgotten.
$C: If there's a continuation of consciousness after death I wonder what he thinks of it.
$C: On Pi Day, no less. RIP.
$C: I just realized he died on Einstein birthday.  
  
RIP.
$C:  This is really sad. I was lucky to meet the man once briefly. I was in high school and he had to come to Texas A&M for a lecture years ago.  I got lost and found myself in an elevator with him and his people. I was shocked and I didn't say much. The woman wheeling him (his wife I think?) asked me if I was attending the lecture. I said yes and looked up and it was silent for almost a minute and then I heard "hope you enjoy it" from his machine and I was visibly shaken. I thanked him and said I was a big fan. The elevator doors opened and we went our ways. And even though 95% of the things he discussed went over my head, that elevator ride is something special and I'll never forget it. An absolute legend and a great loss for science . 
$C: Wow, what a shock. He truly was an inspiration- to the scientific community, to those with ALS, and everyone in between. He showed us the power of the mind, despite the limitations of the body. RIP, you will be missed. 
$C: Spent his whole life studying space and never got to visit :(
$C: I always (unjustifiably) had this subconscious hope that the sheer force of Hawking's intellect was enough to keep him alive despite his condition. Like his brain was parasitically draining the strength of his body so he could transcend into a realm of pure thought where death couldn't touch him. But I guess entropy always wins. We'll miss you Professor Hawking.
$C: Very sad...now joining the cosmos.
$C: I feel strangely weird about his death. I never personally knew the man, but there‚Äôs this strong feeling of we have been left alone in this universe without him now.

Like some kind of Universal beauty has disappeared. A strange feeling of aloneness. 
$C: "Well you need your body to do stuff. How far are you going to travel using only your *mind?*"

"Hold my beer. Literally."

RIP. A true genius.
$C: Very late to this thread.  I was sad to hear of his passing, but I will not really mourn.  He was lucky to have lived past 1964, and I am thankful we had him for as long as we did.  Fitting that he should die on the day Newton died and Einstein was born.  A worthy addition to mankind's history books.
$C: Let's hope heaven has a ramp. 
$C: He lives on in text-to-speech 
$C: Get ready for a lot of dumb people posting a lot of really smart deep-sounding quotes they don‚Äôt understand all over Facebook. 
$C: [RIP](https://youtu.be/Gb2jGy76v0Y)
$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfcC6FYyL4U

Rest in Peace Hawking, you'll be missed
$C: This guy was diagnosed with motor neuron disease at 21, said "F that," and wet on to live 50 more years while simultaneously kicking science's ass. What a god.
$C: I remember growing up hearing his name and learning about all the great contributions he made to science and just human thought in general. I guess I always thought he would live forever, like one of those people that would always be around. 
$C: With this we lost our second Einstein. How many more before unravel the mysteries of the universe. 
$C: Rest In Peace. You'll be remembered for your work and your inspiration. You've earned it
$C: Damn, shout out to the guy that made me study worm holes! RIP
$C: It‚Äôs a terrible day for rain. 
$C: :( See you, space cowboy
$C: This is a loss for humanity.  
$C: One of humanity‚Äôs greatest minds. Rest In Peace 
$C: This is one of the first deaths that actually hit me hard üò≠rest in peace Stephen Hawking you will be forever missed. Hope you are out there with the Stars taking it all in. 
$C: So long and thanks for all the fish. 
$C: Both his work and his personal life defied logic beyond comprehension.

Goodbye Reddit. I‚Äôll have to change my username after this.
$C: I'm shocked but not surprised. Stephen Hawking fought against his condition. He earned his place among the stars now. RIP Stephen I hope you find peace in the cosmos
$C: Really shocking even though his terminal illness. 
Huge loss for humanity. 
He leaves behind great legacy! 
$C: What a life. 

There is nothing better than having a life where thousands of strangers on an internet forum remark on how great you were. 
$C: His body was broken but his mind soared. 
Rest in peace Professor Hawking.
$C: He always seemed immortal... what a great life he lived. Yesterday, there was no doubt as to who the smartest man alive was. Today there‚Äôs no clue 
$C: During the Trump campaign he gave his opinion on Trump.

"He is a demagogue that appeals to the lowest common denominator."

Some Fox reporter said in response,  "If Mr. Hawking wants to comment on politics, he should speak English next time."

Mr Hawking replied on Twitter no less.  "Mr. Trump bad man.  Very bad man."

What a wit.
$C: I don't know much about him. But I do know he knew a lot.

Nice knowing ya, Stephen Hawkin. RIP
$C: It‚Äôs a loss for all humanity. May he Rest In Peace. 
$C: One of the few people who made me proud to be British. As humorous as he was brilliant. 
$C: RIP Professor Hawking
$C: RIP

Honestly in shock. Hard to imagine a world without this man 
$C: The world will remember Hawking for centuries at least, and the scientific progress he contributed to humanity will not be forgotten
$C: This is pretty unexpected but not surprising at all all things considered.  Either way not many people live to do what he did let alone with ALS.  
$C: Somehow I always thought he would just live forever
$C: I didn't realize he was 76.  That's crazy, rip 
$C: I knew never his death would affect me so much. Didn't expect it at all.
$C: I thought this was fake when I saw it online, we have just lost an incredible individual.

Rest in Peace
$C: We need more great minds like him to inspire others in science
$C: Rest in peace to a great mind.
$C: Holy crap I can't believe this really happened... A genius of our time gone just like that... Rest in Peace Mister Hawking, You will be missed.
$C: F U C K. 

God damn shame. Such an inspiration to many.
$C: Not what I expected to see as I checked Reddit one last time before bed.  

I hope to see him again, maybe on the other side of a black hole, some starlit night. 
$C: He forever changed the way mankind thinks about the cosmos. What a legacy to leave.
$C: This is one of those people that I've never met, and as such never had a DIRECT affect on my life, but I know he has had an immeasurable one based on all of his work. I'm sorry he's gone, but I'm glad we had him for everything he was.
$C: the typical ALS patient will die within 5 years of their diagnosis

Hawking lived 55 years after his diagnosis and changed how we see the universe.
$C: What an amazing man. I hope one day I can achieve half the things he has while in good health.  
$C: Thank you for showing me the universe
$C: This is the first death in quite some time that's left me without words. Didn't even know the guy but the impact he's left on society was immense. 
$C: Now his mind has the whole universe to stretch out in.
$C: Theoretically, he should have died a long time ago. Its a miracle that he was able to live as long as he did, R.I.P.
$C: Fuck. Came straight to Reddit when my friend told me, I didn't even believe him at first. Feels like a day that would never come yet here we are.
$C: I always thought Stephen would be the first among us to achieve immortality. We‚Äôre fucked. 
$C: Damn. There was still so much he could have given us - such a great mind and spirit. 
$C: Must be a diving intervening for him to die on Pi day.
$C: The world just got a little dumber. 
$C: Fuck, what an amazing mind lost and one of the most important cultural figures in our life time. Didn't expect to wake up to see this, if Mr.Hawking isn't an inspiration to us all, I don't know what else is.
$C: Wow, hard to believe someone who you've held up your entire life as a godlike bastion of intelligence is prone to the same conclusion as the rest of us. Rest In Peace, Dr. Hawking.
$C: Hopefully we can get Elon to send his body out to space, the one place he truly wanted to go.
$C: I grew up idolizing this man. It breaks my heart to know that we lost one of the most influential person this earth has given us. May your life long dreams come true with this and many more generations in the future. 
$C: What a great loss... We should all be glad that we lived in the same time frame he did so we could witness such a prodigy. 
$C: At least we still have his voice.
$C: ‚ÄúHowever difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don‚Äôt just give up.‚Äù 

My immense respect for Professor Hawking comes not only from his contribution to our understanding of the universe, but he showed the world what can be achieved with determination, grit, and perseverance. Rest in Peace.
$C: He really seemed like a timeless being, didn't see this one coming.

Rest well, Professor Hawking.

(Watch The Theory of Everything if you haven't seen it already, great movie.)
$C: I can't believe he died, even though he lived with a terminal illness for so long, it just didn't seem like he could die.
RIP
$C: I've often wondered how much more he could have accomplished if not for the disease.  

RIP
$C: Rest In Peace Dr.Hawking, You truly Changed the world. üò≠
$C: Your brief history in our time was well spent. Farewell Stephen
$C: Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Dylan Thomas 
$C: The collective intelligence of the human race just took a giant nosedive. :( 

This man gave us theories that most of us can‚Äôt even wrap our primate brains around. What do we have in comparison? A generation of kids who have strong opinions on what flavor Tide Pod tastes the best. 

We are diminished. :(



$C: When I was in college, I saw a very good friend of mine completely fall apart in a single year at the hands of ALS. I've seen what it does to someone's body, especially in the final days... Nine years ago and the thought of what happened to her is still crushing.

So, admiration for his work aside, I am just glad Stephen Hawking passed at home and near the people he loved. I hope that his perseverance and contributions to society give us the extra motivation to research and help treat ALS; losing one person to it is already losing one person too many.

Rest in Peace.
$C: My sister has cerebral palsy and it  can make life really difficult at times obviously, but my dad always used to tell her anytime she was feeling down, "remember the smartest person in the world is in a wheelchair.." 

Maybe that part is debatable ( if you're a dick) but he really was an inspiration to people and I'm not the type of person that says that a lot.

Rest in peace Stephen Hawking, the world got a little bit darker when you left..
$C: No doubt he lived a decently long life, and he was absolutely one of the most brilliant minds in history and he'll not be forgotten, but fuck ALS. The fact that he maintained a sense of humor throughout his life speaks volumes to the kind of man he was, and I hope to make a fraction of the impact on the world that he has. RIP Dr. Hawking.
$C: It is now the year 1 AH (After Hawking)
$C: This is the Einstein of our generation, a completely unforgettable scientist
$C: "Although I cannot move and I have to speak through a computer, in my mind I am free" - Stephen Hawking

Trapped in his own body, his passion for knowledge and science inspired us all. Humanity has lost one of the greatest minds.
$C: On the birthday of Einstein and Pi day of all days. 
$C: I wonder if his statue will be post-chair or pre-chair? 
$C: Damn... We've lost a hell of a mind today.
$C: I don't know why but Stephen Hawking was one of those guys I just assumed would be around forever. Like... my brain just never considered he'd be gone one day. Dude. This sucks.
$C: ‚ÄúThe world‚Äôs most famous cosmetologist‚Äù

-Your local news anchor
$C: Stephen Hawking was the kind of man who we‚Äôll perhaps get once in a generation. A genius mind who still managed to leave his mark on the world despite his illness. Rest in peace, Mr. Hawking. You were an inspiration to us all, and most likely will continue to be for generations to come.
$C: May the cosmos receive him as well as he received it.
$C: Regardless of your beliefs it would be nice to see him not limited anymore by a wheelchair, out there in space.Rest In Peace. 
$C: I read his mini bio and discovered that with his condition he is not expected to live beyond 23 years of age. He was damn good fighter who not only beat the odds but achieved so much to the benefit of mankind's scientific progress. He truly is something else.
$C: In 3rd grade, we did a project where we had to take on the role of a famous figure, alive or dead, and role-play them while parents and friends walked around to ask questions. 

Other kids had to memorize all of their lines and walk around all afternoon. I wasn't into that. I chose Stephen Hawking because I could sit, have a computer with me and all my lines right in front of my eyes. 

Though my decision might have been motivated by laziness, I have never regretted that little maneuver. Learning about Hawking's life exposed me to one of the most inspiring individuals of a generation. Thank you for opening my young eyes to the amazing worlds of math and science. 

You'll be missed.
$C: Regardless of who you are or where you are,  can we come together as humans to commemorate the death of a man who was truly ahead of his time/cry with meüò¢
$C: He died on Albert Einstein‚Äôs birthday, which also happens to be Pi Day. This guy times.
$C: Holy shit

This is huge news

The most brilliant person alive just died

That‚Äôs pretty fucking significant....
$C: Born on Galileo's death anniversary and died on Einstein's birthday; Tragic, yet somehow poetic. Also, Pi day. Goodbye Professor Stephen Hawking! Stardust stuff went back to the stars :'(
$C: The christians in this thread are full of salt. Absolutely cringe material
$C: Hawking is one of those people you never really thought of as getting older or passing away.

This is definitely a shock 
$C: We lived in the same era as the man who taught us so much about the world above us. We lived in the same era as the man who will be praised thousands of years in the future. We lived in the same era as the man who despite his disability, changed humanity forever 

RIP Stephen Hawking
$C: One of the greatest minds in history, he was a genius in the truest sense of the word. 
$C: 54 years with ALS is not bad considering the average person who gets it passes after 5.
$C: I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised but I kinda felt like he‚Äôd just be lurking for at least another 100 Years 
$C: RIP and today is Einstein‚Äôs Birthday. Legends stay together forever
$C: Atleast it was on Pi day
$C: I do not shed tears when a celebrity dies

I do no shed tears when a politician dies

I cried in my car today

$C: When he was 21 and diagnosed with ALS, he wasn‚Äôt expected to make it to see his 25th birthday. Shocking he loved that long! Rest in piece, Stephen. 
$C: 3/14 is the birthday of Einstein. He passed away on the birthday of Einstein, and at the same age of 76. Guess 76 years is the max lease term of such great minds to us humans. 
$C: Anyone else think it's just a little peculiar that he passed away on Pi day?  3.14 RIP
$C: When you kick a death-sentence disease in the ass for 55 years whilst uncovering the mysteries of the universe, it's such a jarring moment when you pass away. His whole EXISTENCE felt predicated on the idea death had already came for him and he had proven indestructible, RIP Stephen.  
$C: I am shocked, he inspired me to want to wonder about the universe. Through the very early stages of me wanting to make a difference to of what makes us, us... in the world through. All the way too accepting the way things are. I knows that 100% this is absolutely come from the foundations of what he understood to be true.  The world has lost a true hero. 

I cannot even begin to fathom the immense loss that you and your family have gone through. But i want you to whole heartedly know that the man you knew has completeley changed my life and the ones around me. 

I sincerely, have my life to owe to stephen. 

He was and will always remain to be the principle of modern exceptionilism. 

Thank you and your family, honestly you have changed a generation for the better. 

His life was the inspiration of millions to keep going. 

I cannot describe the importance of how much he has had an impact on my life. I am truly devastated. I am at a significant loss without him and my sincerest condolences are among the midst.

$C: Guys, forget this whole pi day and birthday stuff, I have a darker idea. Einstein and Hawking both died at the same age of 76. Einstein died after refusing surgery, some of his last words being "It is tasteless to prolong life artificially." He wanted to die naturally.

Not only did Hawking have plenty of surgery and basically live off technology, but him and Einstein were like ying-yang scientists. On his birthday, Einstein took Hawking at the same age as he was when he died, for prolonging life artificially. 


$C: Wow, new top post of this sub even though it's only a few hours old. It deserves it though, he was a great mind.
$C: RIP one of the greatest minds of our time. You will be missed Stephen Hawking.
$C: A well-known scientist (some say it was Bertrand Russell) once gave a public lecture on astronomy. He described how the earth orbits around the sun and how the sun, in turn, orbits around the center of a vast collection of stars called our galaxy. At the end of the lecture, a little old lady at the back of the room got up and said: "What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant tortoise." The scientist gave a superior smile before replying, "What is the tortoise standing on?" "You're very clever, young man, very clever, " said the old lady. "But it turtles all the way down!
$C: This is perhaps the largest death we have had and will have for a long time. It's like an Einstein or Newton death, they might not have felt it at the time, but they were people that have changed the course of human history. 

Stephen had an immeasurable impact on our world and the way we think. Will be forever missed.
$C: When it comes down to it, I've just realized I don't know too much about Mr Hawking other than his name. Rest in peace.
$C: Rest in peace Stephen Hawking, you are with the stars now
$C: Did they try turning him off and back on? Sometimes you gotta wiggle the power cord on my Xbox. 
$C: dang this one really caught me off guard. 
$C: Damn, rest in peace sir. 
$C: Wow, influential man. RIP 
$C: Man, I always thought he was going to be immortal.
$C: He made it longer than anyone would have guessed. And changed the entire world in the process. RIP.
$C: What an incredible mind he had. Truly one of the greatest. 
$C: May his legacy radiate throughout all space-time. Rest in peace.
$C: He will be missed but due to his work he will remain with us forever.
$C: RIP. Not all hero wear capes 
$C: To live as long as he did with that condition.  On top of everything else.  Well played Stephen. Rest in peace. 
$C: Rest in peace to one of the brightest minds of our generation. Your work wont be forgotten nor will your name.
$C: Into the black hole he goes
$C: Wow, I am in shock. A wonderful mind and human being that still, after all he had contributed, still had more to that he sought to accomplish. From the entirety of humanity, Mr. Hawking, thank you.
$C: Incredible that he lived as long as he did and accomplished as much. RIP to a scientist who truly inspired me
$C: Lets be real tho. We're all surprised he made it this long. RIP my dude
$C: The end of an era. See you in the skies, where you always felt at home anyway.
$C: The man who inspired me to study physics. RIP.
$C: Damn, I'm so used to him just existing in the background. Popping up every once in a while to give his scientific analysis on something. RIP
$C: He seemed to be a scientific constant throughout my life. Rest in Peace, he will be truly missed. A visionary and one of, if not the most brilliant mind.
$C: A man who could solve astrophysics equations in his head. Truly amazing, a shame he had to die
$C: His books had a greater influence on how I perceive the fundamentals of reality more than any other.

*A Brief History of Time, The Universe in a Nutshell,* and particularly *The Grand Design* are mindblowing. Everyone should read them in their 20s.
$C: Oh so he‚Äôs not a cyborg? 
$C: [deleted]
$C: A brief history comes to an end :(
$C: [RIP](http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/futurama/e/ed/Hawking.jpg) Stephen
$C: I just feel lucky that I was alive at the same time as Stephen Hawking. 
$C: He was one of my favorite celebrity cameos in [Futurama and the Simpsons](https://youtu.be/AW-p8s_HCCo)
$C: Stephen Hawking was one of those people that seem like they will live forever. 
$C: Fuck man. I seriously had no idea he was that old.
$C: Fuuuuuuck....

Honestly, its a miracle the guy lasted as long as he did. As brilliant a person as he was however I'm glad he's no longer trapped in his own body, I really can't imagine what that life must have been like. 
$C: He's not dead, just changed in form.
$C: I'm not sure why this has hit me so hard. Maybe because this is truly a moment in history that will be recorded and remembered. I imagine this is what the layman might have felt like when Einstein died.  
$C: Hit me like a ton of bricks. It's really sad to see such an inspiring figure go. He lived a really good life all things considered and I hope his memory and work lives on for ages. RIP Stephen Hawking.
$C: Kind of fitting he passed on pi day. May you rest in peace, Mr. Hawking
$C: He was always one of those people that was practically immortal in my mind. Such a wonderful person gone too soon. RIP, Mr. Hawking
$C: There weren't lots of people alive today who were this important to history, people that we'll remember hundreds of years from now, but he was definitely part of that small group.

Rest in peace, and thanks, Mr. Hawking.
$C: Rest in peace. 

Easily one of the most interesting men to ever live. He gave us a lot. 
$C: His dream of going to space didn't come true :(
$C: That‚Äôs it kids. No more science. 
$C: I still remember his speech...
$C: Thank you, Stephen, for helping us gaze deeper into the mystery.
$C: If there's a more apt day for him to die on than Pi day, I don't know what it is.
$C: I honestly can't believe it. He's an icon of science in this world and he's... gone? This is taking a while for me to process. 
$C: Albert Einstein born March 14  
Stephen Hawking died March 14
$C: 2018 is the new 2017 confirmed
$C: Wow. This hit me like a ton of bricks. This man will go down as one of the greatest minds in all of history, and I‚Äôm so thrilled to have lived in his era. It saddens me that we‚Äôre going to have to go through the next years without his brilliant mind but at least we have all of his previous theories to build from. May he Rest In Peace. Thank you for everything good sir. 
$C: Just heard this. Hawking battled through ALS for long periods of life. May Stephen Hawking rest in peace. 
$C: Someone call Elon Musk and tell him to arrange another Launch. 
$C: I can‚Äôt help but be inspired by this man‚Äôs life and resilience. Such a complete life that the end five decades later than it was ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to come is heavy, but not sad. RIP
$C: doing my math homework in his honor tonight
$C: "However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. While there's life, there is hope"
$C: This man surpassed any road block no matter how huge it was, this man will always be an example of perseverance and will go into history books 
$C: What a man. His insight is going to he missed, but fuck, his Legacy is going to live forever. 
$C: This is one of those passings like Bowie's that's just so out of the blue and unexpected that all you can do is be shamed that you thought the person would always be around.

RIP. You did so much for science and the appreciation of it. We'll always be the richer and the wiser. 
$C: Damn the icon of the science world dead, RIP.
$C: I'm not very in tune with his field, what's the most significant work he's done for astrophysics?
$C: Hawking inspired me to learn more, to be more. Rest In Peace 
$C: I can't believe I learned about this on Twitch chat. RIP Stephen Hawking
$C: Pi day will never be the same. 
$C: To have lived to 76 and done what he has after being diagnosed with ALS at 21 is nothing short of legend. RIP. I only wonder what more you could have taught us if you weren't cursed with such a terrible disease. 
$C: The man was the modern face of science and Inspired countless youth to dream big. 

Sad day indeed 
$C: Rest in peace Mr. Stephen Hawking's. The world will miss you 100%. You loved to learn and you didn't let anything or anyone get in your way. üòì
$C: You know, for a 76 year old man who had ALS for the past 50 years, this news is surprisingly unexpected for me.
$C: Damn. This is just so unexpected. I know he was on borrowed time for a couple of decades, but still. This must be what it felt like for people back when Einstein died.
$C: I am absolutely shocked, but finally he can be free of ALS. 

I would say he's accomplished more then enough for humanity. His life has made a huge impact on science with out a doubt. 
$C: Well fuck. GG 2018, you've got the makings of a year worse than 2016
$C: When people like Stephen Hawking die the first thought that comes to my mind is "Who can possibly carry on that mantle?" It's a sad thought and it speaks highly to the quality of mind that Stephen Hawking was. 
$C: "It would not be much of a universe if it wasn‚Äôt home to the people you love"

A man who lived a life worth living. May he rest in piece amongst the stars.
$C: I don‚Äôt usually get this upset about some famous person passing, but I feel so devastated rn
$C: Now I want to watch "The Theory of Everything".
$C: It's March 14th right now in England too. Hawking died on pi day. Can't think of a more fitting end to a legendary figure. 
$C: When I first read this I thought it was a joke! I'm so deeply saddened that he has passed on :(.he truly was an incredible human being!!
$C: So, sad,  the world has lost on of it's best intellectual minds. RIP.
$C: In the early 1960s he was given 2 years to live. Today he died at age 76 having worked his whole life. He's an inspiration to every one of us, never give up and keep striving! 
$C: A giant has passed RIP. Sir.  
$C: Personally I was never really one for science. But god damn, Dr Hawking's story will remain in my heart for as long as I have one. What an icon.
$C: This made me incredibly upset. We lost a great mind that we are unable to ever replace.
$C: "One, remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Two, never give up work. Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it. Three, if you are lucky enough to find love, remember it is there and don't throw it away."
$C: Press F to pay respects boys
$C: This is something I totally would never have expected to come flying at me like a thunderbolt.... Oh Stephen... I studied you to oblivion and your theories, everything you said, and I can remember all your quotes. 

You were an idol to me in the field of science, now that you're gone, may you rest in peace friend... you have given the human race so much, and you never let your condition stop you.
$C: "We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that I am extremely grateful"  

Truly one of the greatest minds of this lifetime. Thank you Stephen Hawking.
$C: [Great skit of Stephen Hawking with John Oliver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8y5EXFMD4s)
$C: I‚Äôm sad. This man was a genius and one of astronomy‚Äôs most important minds. He deserves to be remembered the same way we remember Einstein and Tesla. Wherever you are now Stephen, I hope you fly on you beautiful spaceman. Rest In Peace Mr. Hawking.
$C: Hopefully this means someone will finally attend his time-travelers party.

RIP
$C: Rest In Peace you smart fucker
$C: I would love to see the debates he and Sagan will have now. 
$C: "For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals. Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination: we learned to talk"
$C: "Quotes from Stephen Hawking to farm karma" - Redditor 2018
$C: It‚Äôs a cliche but this man inspired me so much when I was young and it was with the aid of his empowering words that I achieved so much and never let myself settle for anything less. 


Thank you Stephen Hawking for never letting me feel like knowledge was out of my reach. I hope he made others and will continue to make others feel this way as well
$C: Damn. I remember my grandfather bought me A Brief History of Time when I was like 10, and I read it. Understood every sentence, didn't understand any of the concepts. It gave me a love of physics even till this day. I'll always be thankful to Hawking for that. RIP
$C: One of the only celebrities worth caring about more than an average person.

F
$C: Jesus Christ I didn't think I'd see this today, an amazing man. I don't know if he believed in any form of afterlife but I truly hope wherever he is now he is walking.
$C: I‚Äôll be able to tell the future generations, I witnessed the life of Stephen Hawking.
$C: This is going to hit Sheldon really hard.
$C: Theory of Everything gonna have a spike in views on Netflix.
$C: As a person with a similar condition he was an inspiration he will be missed 
$C: We lost a great mind and a wonderful human being today.What a incredible life Mr.Hawking led dispite his physical handicaps inspiring indeed.
$C: RIP, you gave life and sickness a great run for their money!
.
.
.
and yet, lots of assholes get to live way past that age, this world is not fair.
$C: Wow, this is one of those deaths I wasn't expecting, even though it was a known thing that was going to happen. RIP
$C: Fuck...rest in peace, Professor..
$C: I literally have Steven on my vision board for inspiration and motivation in the pursuit of knowledge. This is sad day for science. 

RIP Dr. Hawking

EDIT: [Here's my board.](https://imgur.com/a/NP7ea) It's not much but it helps. 
$C: I feel as if this is one of the biggest deaths of my lifetime
$C: Truly a tragic loss for the world :(
$C:  Diagnosed at 21, given four years to live. Dies at 76. RIP Stephen Hawking.
$C: The final frontier. He brought it closer to us.
$C: Dang, lost a good one today. I think Dexter's Laboratory introduced me to Hawking via Professor Hawk :)
$C: I don't know what to say other than I'm eternally thankful for his work, and I hope he died knowing a better future was ahead.
$C: Dr. Hawking always helped us light the light bulbs of our minds and imaginations with his wit, his humor, his wisdom, his authenticity, his mastery of the sciences, and his understanding.

Now our bulbs dim in a world without him.

Rest in peace.
$C: Rest in peace. Your contributions to mankind will forever be cherished and remembered. We lost a good one, folks, we lost a good one :(
$C: Still remember the Dexters Laboratory homage episode to him and the [Your Brain Is A Creative Computer](https://youtu.be/BjU4FSqhbKM) tune. 

Rest In Peace.
$C: Rest In Peace Mr.Hawking
$C: May your soul rest in peace
$C: My goal is simple. It is a complete understanding of the universe, why it is as it is and why it exists at all. - Stephen Hawking

 Now you have all the time in the world to think about it. Rest in peace, Stephen. 
$C: This doesn‚Äôt seem real...
$C: Stephen Hawking, thank you for your contributions and perseverance under extreme circumstance.  
$C: And just like that...the world just got a whole lot dumber. RIP.
$C: I remember watching him on TV, and the discussion mentioned that the universe is so enormous that even with everything that's in it, there's still a lot of emptiness.

Well, now it's even emptier.  Farewell, sir.
$C: I'll see you in the stars later, friend.

Thank you.
$C: This is the saddest ‚Äúcelebrity‚Äù death. One of the greatest thinkers of the 20 and 21st centuries. RIP 
$C: "If human life were long enough to find the ultimate theory, everything would have been solved by previous generations. Nothing would be left to be discovered."



We will continue to discover Mr Hawking because...as you said...its inevitable. 

RIP. You'll be missed!!
$C: ...And on Pi day, is this someone's idea of a practical joke??
$C: One night me and my buddy got super high and we came up with this dumb theory that since things travel at different speeds in the universe, for example Light travels faster than Sound. Imagine these things as strings, Light as a sting and Sound as a string. Now imagine that Time was a string. Time has already began and ended. Then imagine Consciousness as a string. Time is Light and Consciousness is Sound. RIP Hawking, you beautiful person. 
$C: Given that fact he was given 2 years to live in 1963 and lived till 2018 is remarkable.

R.I.P 
I aspire to be as smart as great as you one day
$C: This actually makes me profoundly sad. I‚Äôm not sure why, I just feel like his passing leaves a gaping hole.
$C: R.I.P Professor Hawking. Our humanity will surely miss a great man like you. 
$C: He truly defied all odds. Rest In Peace ‚ÄúEinstein‚Äù
[Star Trek Hawking](https://youtu.be/nEa7CfPaCRw) 
$C: Seems like every year people you consider immortal all your life seems to go their way. Haven't felt such disbelief since MJ and Ali. 
$C: I'm just completely in shock, the level of information and intelligence this man has given the planet and has made young children fall in love with science is enormous. 

This is a loss that will shake the world.
$C: An intelligent scientist, Dr. Stephen Hawking, on the headlines of news being remembered for the contributions he made on the frontier of science. He will forever be the man that changed the way we see the universe. Godspeed. Rest In Peace. 
$C: "There are 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 particles in the universe that we can observe, your mama took the ugly ones and put them into one nerd!" 

The man will live on as a part of the universe forever. May he rest in peace. 
$C: Its weird, I was never much to care about science as I struggled with it in school, yet as I open Reddit and see this article I feel nothing but empathy for his children and those who highly respected him. I know he was a very intelligent man, and despite his illness he still carried onwards in the name of science.
Rest easy, Hawking. You done much for us on Earth, now you have much to do and impress in the life beyond!
$C: His IQ + EQ might be the highest ever achieved. 
$C: "He was 76"
Holy crap he was old, should've seen this coming, but seriously, this is so hard to take in. It'll be like when Stan Lee dies... 
$C: Articles say he died March 14th, and right now it is March 13th where I live. Considering his occupation and contributions I find this very fitting
$C: My dude didn't even get to say aliens. 
$C: Huge loss not just for the scientific community but for us all. Rest In peace, Stephen.
$C: I opened reddit and this was the top post, I swear to god I audibly gasped as soon as I saw this
$C: Stephen was responsible for the greatest gift someone can give humanity. The wealth of knowledge he spread and inspiration to look out into the depths of our universe will be the foundation for when we must eventually leave this planet. 
$C: I'm gonna miss the time he ripped John Oliver to shreds.
$C: Wow, not only did Einstein also die at 76, but today is also Einsteins birthday. What a coincidence
$C: 3000 comments in 29 minutes! WOW

RIP Dr Hawking. 


My favorite book was "The Grand Design."
$C: He died during Pi-Day :(
$C: He didn't die. He just figured out how to enter the next plane of existence.
$C: I guarantee you that Trump tweets he was his favorite X-Men. 
$C: He'll be stretchin out tha rhyme like gravity stretches time.
$C: damn. the same day trump announced his solar marine team. i be he‚Äôs already rolling in his grave (and not cause of his chair)
$C: RIP. Astonishing he lived to be about the average life expectancy.
$C: 76 is a long time to live when you have ALS. He led a fruitful life and didn't let his disability get the best of him. An incredible mind lost. A sad day, but every day he lived was a blessed one.
$C: This hit me really hard. I knew this would come one day. But he was such an inspirational voice of reason, while miraculously surviving through a disease that they thought would have killed him decades ago.  I can't believe he is gone
$C: ‚ÄúOne, remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Two, never give up work. Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it. Three, if you are lucky enough to find love, remember it is there and don't throw it away.‚Äù
$C: I am honestly at a loss for words. I never met the dude and it feels like I lost a family member
$C: A brief history of time was one of the first books that got me interested in science and physics. 

What a great human being and what a legacy to leave behind 
$C: His body has passed. But his knowledge and legacy lives on
$C: The Universe in a Nutshell single-handedly made me love science as a kid. Thank you. Thank you so much.
$C: Time to rewatch The Theory On Everything as tribute
$C: "Look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious."

-Stephen Hawking
$C: Heroes get remembered, but legends never die. RIP Mr hawkings. 
$C: Passed away on pi day. Thank you for your contributions Hawking.
$C: Bye bye, Dr Stephen Hawking. Thank you so much. 
$C: He died on Pi Day. 3.14.
$C: A man that proved as long as you are thinking nothing is holding you back.
 
you‚Äôll be missed Mr Hawking.
$C: I know it‚Äôs strange, but I never expected him to die 
$C: Damn. Incredible man and mind. 

Rest in peace. 
$C: Well he came this far. So that‚Äôs a win in my book. 
$C: Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change.

And adapt to change we shall. Rest in peace Mr. Hawking
$C: RIP Mr. Hawking, hope you've found your utopia (and not a fruitopia) :'(
$C: nooo, maybe he discovered something that shouldn't be discovered


rip steven
$C: It is always sad to see one of the greatest mind leaving us. Even with his condition and his age, he is constantly trying to expand human's knowledge.

and the next thing came into my mind.. why not trump...
$C: Genuinely taken back by his death, as I said to those around me Humanity as a race lost an incredible man today.

R.I.P Stephen Hawking
$C: Really makes you want to be a better person.  We can be so much more.
$C: Inprovise, adapt, overcome
$C: Rest in peace Mr. Hawking. 
$C: Stephen Hawking dies on Pi day.. what a coincidence.
$C: Can't wait for the melodysheep tribute to this great man. Many tears will be shed. 
$C: A tiny super massive blackhole just formed inside my heart.
$C: I opened reddit and gasped.  :( I'm so sad.  We lost an amazing man and an amazing mind. 
$C: What a blessing it was. RIP
$C: He was one day shy of enjoying one more Pi day :(
$C: Holy shitsnacks. This is not how I wanted to end my day :'( RIP Professor Hawking.
$C: Prof Hawking‚Äôs cameo in a short video clip on what a wonderful world we live in:

https://youtu.be/at_f98qOGY0
$C: Rip my dude, thanks for the inspiring life you lead.
$C: Thank you for your knowledge, Stephen Hawking! You had a tremendous impact on making humanity better!
$C: Oh shit. RIP. If only he could live longer. 
$C: Can Elon put his ashes on the next rocket?
$C: Somehow I never saw him as mortal because this just feels so unexpected. Thank you, Mr. Hawking, for all of your contributions. RIP
$C: I was fortunate enough to see Professor Hawking once! I had the Honor of cutting the grass at the university owned condo he was staying in! Imagine cutting a lawn, a van pulls into the driveway and out rolls freakin Stephen Hawking! 
$C: A Brief History of Time changed the way I saw the universe as a student.  Thank you Dr. Hawking for all that you did.
$C: The man was one of my heroes, not sure this feels real yet. RIP.
$C: Wow, I was just watching the last Big Bang Theory episode when I saw this news. They just mentioned a joke about him. RIP :(
$C: And all I see on the Facebook comments about this are so called loving christians saying he's "burning in hell." I'm so full of rage and sadness and disgust all at once.
$C: And now he belongs to the cosmos.


$C: My heart just sank. We have lost a true pioneer. 
$C: The world's iq just dropped like √• stone.   R.i.p professor Hawking.
$C: An amazing mind.. he will be missed. Until we find out he downloaded his conscious into a computer. Well done.
$C: Thank you, Professor Hawking.
$C: I was raised by two astrophysicists in a NASA centric home and developed next to no interest in the field. Still, this is the hardest I‚Äôve taken a death of a stranger. I feel like i was raised on quotes and books and speeches be Hawking and Sagan. I absolutely cannot wrap my head around them both being gone. 
$C: [Here](https://www.physicsoftheuniverse.com/scientists_hawking.html) is a brief outline of some of his work. 

And [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8y5EXFMD4s) is an interview he had with John Oliver. Seems like he had a pretty good sense of humor.
$C: How sad. The world lost a brilliant mind today.
$C: The world has known your genius and indelible spark of wit.

Thank you, Dr. Hawking, for continuing to light the world with your relentless drive for knowledge and understanding.

You are already missed. 
$C: I literally just watched a video about how he lived so long with ALS this morning :( I‚Äôm so sad 
$C: Holy friggin heck this man was an inspiration! The old geezer didn't deserve this! Stephen Hawking deserves to fly high like a real hawk! Let's remember this man for ever! He made me realize my true potentch in gaming and I love him for that! 
$C: He's whipin angels now
$C: ‚Ä™Stephen Hawking died on Einstein‚Äôs birthday - Pi day. What a remarkable coincidence. ‚Ä¨

‚Ä™You were one of many reasons I‚Äôve been interested in the sciences for nearly all of my life. Thank you for that.‚Ä¨

‚Ä™RIP Professor Hawking.‚Ä¨
$C:  >"We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special."

Rest in peace, you crazy space monkey.
$C: It is remarkable that he was able to live so long when ALS patients have a life expectancy of less than 5 years. It really shows the strength this man had. It is really sad to see one of the most brilliant minds leave us. Rest in peace Mr.Hawking, thank you for all the contributions to science and education you made. You really inspired many to pursue knowledge.
$C: I'll never forget [the bit he did on Last Week Tonight](https://youtu.be/T8y5EXFMD4s)
$C: I‚Äôm usually not affected by famous people dying but for some reason I‚Äôm a bit shook over Hawking passing. I feel like humanity lost someone very important, almost like when a TV show kills off a main character.

He‚Äôs basically the Einstein of our lifetime and now he‚Äôs gone.

This fucking sucks :/
$C: He did more for humanity than most will despite his physical disability. We lost a great mind today, R.I.P.
$C: Rest in peace, Stephen Hawking. Thank you for your brilliant contributions.
$C: One of the great physicists of the 20th century.

But for a guy who was given a year to live back in the 1960s, he did pretty damn good.

$C: ‚ÄúMy goal is simple. It is a complete understanding of the universe, why it is as it is and why it exists at all.‚Äù

Always made me chuckle, now he's probably doing just that. Rest up man
$C: is it crazy he died on Pi day? (3-14) 
$C: "It matters if you just don't give up." -Stephen Hawking
$C: A legend and one of the most brilliant minds to ever exist on this planet. RIP Mister Hawking
$C: I really looked up to Hawking, not just because he was hyper-intelligent and all that, but because he always found time to crack jokes. I don‚Äôt remember the interview he had, perhaps it was with John Oliver, but you could tell he was out of this world with roasting.
$C: And today is Albert Einstein's Birthday 
$C: Thank you Stephen.  Thank you.
$C: The deepest sadness I feel for humanity‚Äôs loss, I cannot put in to words :(
$C: I feel like humanity lost its brightest star.
$C: The world was better for having him,  and lesser now we've lost him. 

Brave,  imaginative,  brilliant and stubborn - no disease or death would prevent him from living to his full extent. 
$C: He outlived a diagnosis of ALS by 55 years! Incredible.
$C: God has left the server
$C: His mind was absolutely amazing. Today we lost one of the truly greatest human beings to ever exist.
$C: One of the greatest minds of our time. RIP
$C: See you, space cowboy.
$C: To quote MC Hawking:
‚Äú‚ÄúE" stands for energy, yo that's me
I'm a brilliant scientist and a dope MC
Before you step to me I'd think twice G
I'm the Lord of Chaos, King of Entropy‚Äù
$C: This is such a tremendous loss for humanity. RIP Dr. Hawking. Thanks for imparting wisdom and knowledge on a subject most of us have an elementary understanding of.
$C: He was a towering and almost mysterious figure to me when I was growing. There have been a few public figure deaths I remember. I recall Michael Jackson dying while I was in middle school. The people around me were shocked and stunned. I didn‚Äôt understand their emotion because I just didn‚Äôt have a connection with him. Some lead singer of Linkin Park died over the summer and a few interns were shocked at the death as well. Neither of these deaths made me feel anything. That‚Äôs why I want to take time to reflect and analyze why I felt so sad‚Ä¶.yeah just sad that Stephen died.

As most kids, I found space incredibly fascinating. I recall spending entire days watching documentaries of space to the point where I got sick of hearing the same recycled lines over and over again‚Äî‚ÄùWe are all merely stardust.‚Äù Particularly, I found the magnitude of space, stars, planets, and galaxies thrilling to ponder. It‚Äôs mysterious and alluring to think about the scale of just our sun compared to earth. It‚Äôs also beautiful and captivating to see pictures of galaxies formed of an incredibly amazing number of stars and planets and a crazy amount of empty space. 

I recall just a few days ago looking up at the stars on my way home from a tiring night at Gates CS building at around 01:00. I stood in the middle of campus just looking up at the stars and feeling‚ÄîI suppose‚Äîwonder. It‚Äôs a common feeling to have while looking up, but this feeling of wanting to discover and learn was nourished by watching these documentaries, of which Stephen Hawking usually played an important part.

Feeling excited about space and watching those documentaries may have no connection to the type of person I am now, but I do think it is wonderful to consider how excited these documentaries made me towards scientific and technical subjects‚Äîeven if they introduced concepts at an extremely high and digestible level. There was never a feeling of shame or hatred towards science and math because I thought people who ‚Äúdid science and math,‚Äù like Stephen Hawking, were simply cool! 

As I have never met Stephen and know not much more about his life than a viewer of The Theory of Everything, I don‚Äôt really understand why I have this feeling of sadness over his death. Though, sometimes it‚Äôs fine to not understand feelings and to allow feelings to simply occur for they deserve their time to be lived out. Rest in peace, Dr. Hawking. üò¢ 
$C: RIP. We all lost a very special person in the history of humanity today. 
$C: Rest in peace, my friend. You will always be remembered. 
$C: Gone from the living but immortalised Nonetheless. Thanks goes to him for all he has contributed to the human race.
$C: Debabteably the smartest known person of our time, RIP
$C: R.I.P to the greatest mind, poetic as well since it‚Äôs Pi day.
$C: This is so sad. I hope he has found a well deserved peace.  Humankind's combined IQ just took a nose dive.
$C: Did not expect this news stun me like it did, makes no sense, guess he seemed to have defied the odds so greatly that it felt like he would live forever. RIP
$C: It's somewhat beautiful that a man of maths would leave this world on pi day.

A great mind and a legendary human being - departing to the infinite. Farewell S.H.

$C: This is a genuine gut punch. Hawking's body failed him decades ago, but he never once used that as some sort of excuse. 

Hawking made humanity better. He will be rightfully remembered for as long as humans exist. 
$C: He was born on Galileo's death anniversary and died on Einstein's birth anniv.
$C: Rest in peace to one of the most legendary men of science ever. 
$C: I hear Mozarts Lacrimosa.
$C: Gone is a great mind at a time when the world needs it the most. 
$C: He didn't die. He ascended.
$C: Me: aww Stephen hawking died today.
My wife: the skateboarder?! He was so young!
Me: ...that‚Äôs Tony Hawk hun...
$C: The world is a much dumber place with his passing. 

May he find the great laboratory in the sky. 
$C: I feel like  a huge asshole for not being shocked.

I knew very little of him besides him being brilliant and disabled. I appreciate that much though. He showed people that being disabled didn't make you worthless. 
$C: RIP Mr Hawking! You made a lot of persons discover astrophysics and were a true single character. I hope you have found a singularity in which you did not have your disease.
$C: Rest in peace, a brilliant mind confined to an earthly chair. But now his spirit can soar through the cosmos. 
$C: NONONO NOOOOO NOOOOO!!!!! His amazing mind! D': I wanted to know more discoveries about the universe
$C: I would like to think all the questions he couldn‚Äôt answer in  life, he now knows all the answers to.
$C: I‚Äôll be proud to say that I was alive during his lifetime. We‚Äôve lost another Einstein. 

On a happy note, imagine his reaction if he were to discover that there is an afterlife. 
$C: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge." RIP.


$C: I hope he‚Äôs exploring the cosmos right now, free from his body prison. 
$C: This man was our generation's Newton. He was our Einstein. He will be remembered throughout history in the same light.
$C: I posted this to face and Twitter, but I feel the need to post it here too: 

Shit. An idol for handicapped people the world over, Stephen Hawking taught me that I could still be successful in spite of my disability. As long as I had my mind, the rest was irrelevant. Rest in peace sir. I hope to be half of the model you are someday.
$C: Wow. I wonder if in 100 years he will be regarded the same as Einstein, Da Vinci, Tesla, or any other great mind the likes of which we see only once in a lifetime or more
$C: Press to F pay respects.
$C: I guess we are all feeling what people must of felt when Einstein passed away. In total disbelieve and shock. 

From here, who‚Äôs going to take his place and explain quantum physics and to us? 
$C: The man was a true pioneer in science and physics. A true inspiration to all of us that no matter our disabilities or shortcomings, we can do great things for humanity. 
$C: If Einstein was Jordan Hawking was Kobe
$C: A brain of knowledge we can never get back. :(

He‚Äôs a legend and will be missed. 
$C: Such a loss for the world. 
$C: I don't want to believe it, I don't want. 
He is one of the greatest minds ever, an amazing person, a truly example that there are not limits. I don't want him to be gone :(

This is so sad... 
$C: Such a great loss for science and humanity, but he has given so much for so long. Rest in peace.
$C: I was listening to the audiobook of "A Brief History of Time" this morning... and wondering how long he would live and how so few people in passing would seem to leave such a hole in our progress towards understanding our place in existence. RIP.

$C: He died on Einstein's birthday tragic yet somehow poetic R.I.P to one of the most brilliant humans to ever live.
$C: I... I can't even believe the headline I'm reading right now... Surely this can't be true.
$C: Stephen Hawking was like the anti-DeVos,
If she went away, It would be no loss.
I‚Äôm in awe of his mind,
Knowledge he left behind,
But Betsy? Can go, along with her boss.

$C: Fuck. There goes the smartest person on the planet.
$C: I just get on Reddit and the top 6 posts in my feed are this.  I can‚Äôt deal with this right now, I‚Äôm going to sleep.
$C: Everything was dark and silent. The weight of uncertainty finally discarded, giving way to freedom. Things changed when, as slowly as a dewdrop rippling in a still pond, the darkness gave way to millions of stars. As soon as the big blue orb came into view, a familiar voice stirred the observer awake.

The car comes alive, shifting some of its parts to reveal more features fitted for space travel. A song begins to broadcast on the open channel, and those listening below gingerly sing along to "Space Oddity". (RIP: Stephen Hawking. You'll always be Legendary.)
$C: ‚ÄúLife would be tragic if it weren‚Äôt funny‚Äù

-Stephen Hawking

He always had such a great outlook on life. Wherever you are, I hope you find all of the answers you are looking for. 
$C: If there is an afterlife, Mr. Hawking, I'm sure you'd love,  more than anyone,  to let us know.  I  cordially invite you to my 'afterlife' party. You know where.  
$C: This must be how everyone felt when Einstein went.... He's the only great mind that is currently alive that you could bring up to pretty much anyone and they knew the name. 

A pioneer in scientific thought
Another of humanities greatest had passed on.
$C: RIP Mr Hawking. now you can explore the universe.
$C: This man was the one who inspired me to become a scientist. He tackled life with such optimism and refused to let his illness force him to resign to a life of sadness. I wish I had the chance to tell him how much he impacted my life and so many others with his intelligence and fervor to pursue knowledge. He will be sorely missed, and the world grew a little dimmer tonight. Rest in peace, Stephen Hawking, you sure as hell have earned it.
$C: 3:14 is a very fitting day... 
$C: Bring on all the quotes. I‚Äôll read em all
$C: Now He Will
Time Travel

$C: Einstein died aged 76 as well
$C: For someone who was given 2 years to live in 1964, he's given us several lifetimes worth of knowledge. I hope that his legacy will carry on well into the future.

Like stopping AI from becoming to advanced. He warned us about that! 


$C: I love how he insisted on keeping his robotic voice, as he‚Äôd come to identify with it as his own. Major work went into keeping ‚Äúhis voice‚Äù exactly the same, even as the technology advanced. 

[There was an ELI5 on it too.](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2h0hhd/eli5_why_does_stephen_hawkings_speech_generator/)
$C: How great would it be to bring back the ALS ice bucket challenge for this great man. But lets not go through that again and just donate to a good association. RIP Stephen Hawking
$C: To Stephen Hawking. 

Man, humanist, scientist, and pioneer. One of the most intelligent minds of the 21st century. You will live in our mind and hearts as long as humanity can survive our insufferable ignorance.
$C: God Speed to the Final Frontier.
$C: Did not expect to cry.

You will be missed.
$C: Rest in peace, he was the greatest mind of our generation, and its a huge loss to see him go. He will go on forever not just with all of the knowledge he imparted, but also In all of the unread but often owned A Brief History of Time's. He once called it the most unread, most owned book.
$C: Rest well you absolute superstar. 
$C: Of all the shitty Stephens death could‚Äôve taken, they took the most important one
$C: It was a medical oddity that he lasted as long as he did with his condition. 

And this actually lead to him contributing to research into ALS which will hopefully help other people with his condition.
$C: His quote on being disabled is a daily inspiration: 

My advice to other disabled people would be, concentrate on things your disability doesn't prevent you doing well, and don't regret the things it interferes with. Don't be disabled in spirit as well as physically.

Rest In Peace Professor Hawking.
$C: Some part of me was just expecting the ability to preserve/transplant/whatever needs to be done to give a person with such a crippling disease a new means of going on and thriving was going to happen in time to be very eagerly given to him as soon as it's discovered, as a thank you for presenting the higher pursuits of science in such a compelling way, and inspiring the further progress of our species. Even when it was so difficult to do so for him, physically, and probably would've been so much easier to retreat inward and let his affliction hold him back, he championed ascendant ideas to all who would listen, even when he couldn't speak.

I guess I'm just suddenly realizing now how much of an impact he had on me, as an inspiration. But he made his time fuckin' count, in spite of all of the easier options, and I can reconcile my own feeling of loss knowing that. Or at least once these tears finally dry up.
$C: He passed away on 3.14! :'(
RIP Dr Hawking.
$C: It‚Äôs wonderful that he got to live such a fulfilling life despite his illness. An admirable human being that won‚Äôt be forgotten. 
$C: The stars of the cosmos flickered,I'm sure, to make room for one more.
$C: Wow.
I memorized the equation for the Schwarzschild Radius equation in 3rd grade cause I got into astrophysics and astronomy due to reading from Stephen.
$C: He wasnt, then he was and now he isnt. Rest in Peace Professor!
$C: He was kind of losing it towards the end there with some pretty wild predictions. Still, the news came as a shock.
$C: Fuck, as if I wasn't feeling shitty enough this week... I never thought this would happen...
$C: Quick, freeze his brain until we can upload it to the cloud 
$C: Elon Musk, please make Stephen your next satalitte.
$C: I didn‚Äôt even know he was so old 
$C: RIP, truly a one of a kind individual.
$C: I know Hawking was a highly rated scientist, but I am totally ignorant of his works. Is there a book that he wrote I should read to get an idea what he did for science? RIP. 
$C: Stephen Hawking was one of those sadly rare figures whose popularity cut across nearly all of the lines that normally divide us. Truly a loss. 
$C: Wow, hearing this really has me feeling weird. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been this effected by the death of a famous person. At the same though, considering his age and his physical condition, it shouldn‚Äôt have caught me off guard as much as it did. I guess Stephen Hawking always seemed like a person who would live forever through sheer will power alone. RIP to on of the greatest minds of our generation. You will be missed.
$C: He will live on in our hearts. He deserves it. He fought for us, and our futures. Let us never forget.
$C: Goodbye Professor Hawking, and thank you.
$C: Stephen Hawking died on Albert Einstein birthday.
$C: Truly a sad day for the whole world. R.I.P Stephen!
$C: This man is a legend. His story and teachings will live forever. 
$C: For a guy who couldn't do much of anything alone, he sure had an impact. Much of the physics I love and try to wrap my mind around was figured out by the guy, certainly a mind to be missed. 

On the flip side, guy had a decent life all things considered. Never seen a disabled person looking quite as ecstatic as the pictures of him in the NASA low gravity simulating plane. 

It's better to celebrate his life than mourn his death, so I hope people don't get all sentimental that we've lost one of the greatest minds of history. He was never going to stick around long, be glad we had him while we did and were able to further our understanding of the universe with his help.
$C: > "I felt it was very unfair - why should this happen to me," he wrote.

&nbsp;


> "At the time, I thought my life was over and that I would never realise the potential I felt I had. But now, 50 years later, I can be quietly satisfied with my life."

&nbsp;

Rest in peace, Stephen Hawking.
$C: Lord, we give you Dr. Hawking. Try not to piss him off.
$C: Damn, I didn't expect this. Rest in peace, Mr. Hawking.
$C: ELI5 how he managed to stretch two years to live to 50 or so? Don't mean this in a rude way, just curious. Is there any known reason why he lived decades longer than the typical diagnosis of somebody with ALS?
$C: May you be among the stars Mr Hawking. they call to you.
$C: As soon as I heard the news, I didn't show signs of sadness.

Instead, I was so happy this man lived a great, fulfilled life and will be remembered forever.

Rest in peace, Stephen.
$C: I guess now he gets an answer to all his questions
$C: Everyone needs to watch "The Theory of Everything" right now
$C: Just commenting to leave my mark in this historical thread. RIP, you will be missed.
$C: Dang. Most people only know him as The celebrity scientist, but his efforts to make some of the really complicated science readeable by idiots like me was really rad.

He will be missed.
$C: Given how quick we are to move on and forget in this turbulent age of (mis)information, I truly hope with my heart that humanity remember him as one of the most brilliant minds of our age, and also that his life story serves as a prime example that regardless what the circumstances of your life may be, you can overcome, achieve and surpass whatever challenges life brings you and rise above.
May you find the answers and explanations for all the questions your curious mind formulated, and may it bring you peace. Rest in peace Stephen. 
$C: Very sad news and what a loss for the scientific community. Given how prevalent he was in general popular culture, I already feel a weird sort of emptiness thinking about it... RIP and thank you for your contributions Dr. Hawking.
$C: [removed]
$C: Honestly I didnt believe it when I first saw it. You really just dont think he will pass despite him having a terminal illness till he actually does.
$C: I wonder if he was ready to die. I know none are, but given his contributions to science, was he waiting to find something before he puts an end to all his work? 

 I'm gonna go now and read "a brief history of time" again and cry. :'(

You'll be missed, Mr. Hawking.
$C: This is what growing older feels like. All the people you admire fade into memories until you are by yourself.
$C: Damn. He was a good lad. 
$C: It was his time. He suffered enough. Hopefully his legacy will be as remembered at Einstein‚Äôs was.
$C: Rest well, Dr.Hawking.
$C: I didn't know he was a Putin critic. RIP
$C: My grandfather was a very religious man, visiting the local temple on a daily basis come what may! He passed away on a date of Ganga-Dussehra in 2016, which everyone else claimed was the most auspicious day to pass away as it meant the person has lived a pious life and most probably going to attain moksha. 

Stephen Hawking, braved through the years, with an infectious smile and with such positive outlook. His books and quotes just add to his profound knowledge and deep respect/belief for humanity. Incidentally, he too passed away on Pi-day, an auspicious day in the world of science. 

Co-incidence? I hope not. 

Keep the humour alive up there, Dr. Stephan Hawking.
$C: Here I was alt-tabbing and pulling up reddit to look at something unimportant and this is at the top of my feed.

Holy shit.
$C: This makes me sad. Another hero down:(
$C: Jesus may walk on water, but only Stephen Hawking runs on batteries. 

RIP
$C: If this man was in the United States, he would have been left to die when he was first diagnosed as he would never have been able to afford treatment.

Social healthcare allowed one of the greatest minds ever to live to actually have some chance of living (yes, he eventually went private, but he always credited his life to the NHS) 

Think how many great minds in the United States are dying early and never getting a chance to thrive. 
$C: There is a parallel universe where he is still alive. Rest in peace, one of the greatest (if not the best) scientist in the whole galaxy :^( 
$C: The world just got a lot dumber 
$C: Anyone think it's odd that someone incredibly talented and famous like /r/StephenHawking would have fewer subs than some random bimbo like /r/AlexisRen?
$C: Neil DeGrasse Tyson:

‚ÄúHis passing has left an intellectual vacuum in his wake. But it's not empty. Think of it as a kind of vacuum energy permeating the fabric of spacetime that defies measure. Stephen Hawking, RIP 1942-2018.‚Äù
$C: He was an absolute legend in so many ways a true inspiration of what is possible even when faced with huge adversity.
$C: I actually jumped a little when I read the title. It never really occurred to me that such a great individual could die... he‚Äôs always just been a part of my life and what I would refer to as ‚Äúsmart‚Äù and ‚Äúwise‚Äù. It never occurred to me that he was getting on in years, and that his condition might be speeding up the process even more. May he Rest In Peace. Gone but NEVER forgotten!
$C: A huge loss for the species.
$C: One of the greatest minds of our time is lost. It was really an honour to live during the same time in history as him. Rest in peace professor. 
$C: A true champion of humanity! May he rest in peace.
$C:   -  Stephen Hawking‚Äôs 3 favorite songs.


‚Äú[Symphony Of Psalms](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DqWZGUO_eoc) was in fact the first piece of music Professor Hawking ever purchased. ‚ÄúI first became aware of classical music when I was 15,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLPs had recently appeared in Britain. I ripped out the mechanism of our old wind-up gramophone and put in a turntable and a three-valve amplifier. I made a speaker cabinet from an old book case, with a sheet of chip-board on the front. The whole system looked pretty crude, but it didn‚Äôt sound too bad. At the time LPs were very expensive so I couldn‚Äôt afford any of them on a schoolboy budget. But I bought Stravinsky‚Äôs Symphony Of Psalms because it was on sale as a 10‚Äù LP, which were being phased out. The record was rather scratched, but I fell in love with the third movement, which makes up more than half the symphony.‚Äù


[Wieniawski‚Äôs Violin Concerto No. 1](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aNOdaBJbT8A)Professor Hawking was actually inspired to buy a collection of Wieniawski‚Äôs music after hearing his second concerto on Radio 3 in the 1990s, but prefers the first in particular for its ‚Äúhaunting phrase in the first movement‚Äù.


[Francis Poulenc‚Äôs Gloria](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ReqsEqKtyyA) is the final piece in Professor Hawking‚Äôs musical trilogy. Part of the work caused a ‚Äúscandal‚Äù ‚Äì in the French composer‚Äôs own words ‚Äì when it was first performed in 1959 because of its unusual mixture of light-heartedness and spirituality. Poulenc later explained that he had been thinking of frescoes in which angels stick out their tongues and ‚Äúserious Benedictines whom I saw playing soccer one day‚Äù when he wrote it.
Professor Hawking first heard the Poulenc Gloria in Aspen, Colorado, during the resort‚Äôs 1995 music festival. ‚ÄúYou can sit in your office in the physics centre there and hear the music without ever buying a ticket,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut on this occasion I was actually in the tent to hear the Gloria. It is one of a small number of works I consider great music.‚Äù

$C: He dies on 3.14 (Pi), at the age of Albert Einstein and at the birthday of Albert Einstein, too. It literally looks like he lived trough his illness which most of people kills in matter of just some years just to die on this day. Rest in Peace.
$C: died on PI day. fitting. 
$C: Reading this is just surreal. I knew he was old and sick but the thought of him just suddenly passing away like this never really crossed my mind. We've just lost one of the greatest minds of our time. Rest in peace.
$C: This is a huge loss to the human race. His mind will define his generation. 
$C: I got to my physics lab at uni today and the tutor began the class by saying we were going to start on a sad note as Stephen Hawking has just died. Jaws dropped left, right and centre. May his legacy live on forever.
$C: Elon musk needs to launch the lads body into a black hole. 
$C: Rip Steven Hawking you inspired me and many others
$C: He was a inspiration. One of the best and generous human beings...
$C: He's done alot for the human race. RIP.
$C: He'll be missed as one of humanity's greatest contributors to physics and the mysteries of space..... Rest in Peace professor
$C: Of course he passes on Pi Day
$C: He lived a long life but it is still a great loss to mankind. RIP.
$C: Rest in peace, Stephen Hawking.
$C: RIP Mr. Hawking.

Your wonderful explanation taught me and my dad(who never have a chance to study in high school)  a lot about the universe and for time to time, we talk about all the things we could think of, about earth and the space. I have never saw him so enthusiastic on a topic likes that, Thank you.
$C: I didn't think I'd be this shocked and saddened by this news. I think, as many have mentioned, I partly thought he would live forever but it's not just that that saddens me. I struggle to understand what he researched and theorised, I think it is beyond my comprehension (believe me I've tried) and whilst he is one of the most intelligent people to have ever lived and we were a lucky generation to live at the same time as him, with his commentary on society, it was his personality, and the loss of that, that is truly sad. He was a huge intellect but never felt the need to put others down, he never felt the need to belittle others who don't understand - like myself, never seemed to be bitter (in latter years though I am aware he definitely did struggle with this in the past) though he could have every excuse to, took every day as a blessing, overwhelmingly positive, and he recognises the true value of empathy, compassion, love and it's importance. He was a generous man; sharing his time and knowledge with everyone, his sense of humour, and his positivity. What upsets me the most though is that I feel that he was never truly rewarded for what he has done. He has made immeasurable difference in our understanding of the universe and whilst he has had many people thank him for that and for inspiring them he never got to go to space. That is what I would have loved for him. I know he never asked for thanks or recognition but it would have been amazing to have given him that chance, something he really wanted. RIP Stephen Hawking, you were so much more than a highly intelligent man. 
$C: Sad to hear this.  [Here is my favourite image](https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2017-03/stephen-hawking_650x400_61490128319.jpg?output-quality=70&output-format=webp) of Stephen Hawking.  Experiencing 0g.  In art school I put a video clip of this on a loop, since lost - and tucked it on a small screen in on the ceiling of a gallery.  There was something so beautiful and profound about the worlds leading authority on gravity, who was normally confined to a wheelchair hanging weightless and grinning ear to ear.
$C: This man had such a strong will to live that could cheat death for more than 50 years, more than 25 times the life span he was diagnosed.  
Lived a whole life, had a family, and put a mark in history.  
This man has taught us that the only true disability, is unreasonable fear.
$C: I feel as if the world just lost a great sense of help and insight with Stephens death, he brought so much more to the world than we think. Besides being a great mind he was also a great role model and a guiding light for humanity in our current age. Let us never forget what he did for us. Thank you Stephen Hawking for opening our hearts and minds to science and it's great wonders. R.I.P. 
$C: Oh. Oh damn. Man....

Stephen Hawking did a lot to fuel my interest in science as a kid. Rest in peace, man.
$C: I am heartbroken. This is the most influential physicist since Einstein. Reminds me of Sagan's death. My grandmother and one of my role models in the same year, wow. Hawking and Neil Tyson made me fall in love with astronomy and study it. Prayers for his family.
$C: lf l have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants. lt is sad for me to hear our giant of physics go to his last home. As the most commets goes, l also don‚Äôt realize he was that old. We must always remember his name:Stephen William Hawking because of his his rich thoughts and knowledge.
$C: I really wish he could have seen the James Webb telescope in action :(.  Such a loss for the world. 
$C: Wow - I will sincerely miss Hawking.  He was such a beacon of hope
$C: Honestly, first "celebrity" death that made me pause for a second.. it was a little shocking, i never imagined there would be a time where he wouldnt be alive. I just sort of expected him to always be there, since hes been a familiar name since i was a little kid. Now hes actually gone. Very sad, but i think he lived a very fulfilling life and he knew better than most that people dont live forever. Youll be missed Stephen
$C: Huge loss in the cosmology world. RIP sir. 
$C: I honestly can't believe that he died. He was such an amazing man, living far past his life expectancy, but more importantly because he significantly advanced science.

Rest in peace, Stephen Hawking. You will never be forgotten.
$C: On Pi Day no less.

Also Einstein's birthday.

It seems a day about science and those dedicated to it.
$C: A Brief History of Time was the first science book I ever read for fun.  I got car sick reading it on family trips and drives.  I remember trying to puzzle out those ideas as being super important to the way I learn today.  This guy basically taught me how to learn. 
$C: I hope there's a time travelers that will go and visit his funeral someday. I'm so very shocked of what is happened.
$C: RIP Stephen Hawking.
The world is a poorer place for your passing, truly the greatest mind of the modern era and an irreplaceable man. Again the world is now a poorer place for the passing of such a wonderful man. He has given, and shown us all so much in life and humanity - against all odds. Professor Hawking you're my hero. A brilliant mind and a great sense of humor. His massive body of works will keep me intrigued for life. The world has lost a Newton, an Einstein, a true genius.

$C: Sad he's gone but he proved his doctors wrong and lived alot longer than 2 years. Just unfortunate he had that disease.
$C: Who would you put at the top of your news site today? The death of the brightest mind on earth or the death of some 62 year old woman who once starred in a movie with Elvis?
https://i.redd.it/i86hrr4xhql01.png
$C: I was thinking we should honor him by making a tweet on the history of time with the hashtag #BriefHistoryOfTime 
$C: It's interesting that though everyone knew he had a debilitating condition many are still awe struck by his death. I believe a goal for anyone would be to affect people so profoundly and fondly that your life is perceived as something stronger than mortality. I saw a similar reaction to Bowie's passing and I find it quite beautiful and inspiring that there are people in society that are respected that deeply. RIP Stephen Hawking. 
$C: man I though that guy would live forever. 
$C: ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§Ü‡§ú ‡§ß‡§∞‡§§‡•Ä ‡§∏‡•á ‡§è‡§ï ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§∞‡•ã‡§∂‡§®‡•Ä ‡§ö‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§ó‡§à...

I hope, now in a better world, Stephen Hawking is an interstellar traveller who gets to live his dream.
$C: RIP. I'm still shocked and so saddened to hear about his death :(
$C: He died on Pi day (3/14)
$C: One of my life's ambitions was to meet Professor Stephen Hawking. Sadly that will never happen now.

He was an inspiration for me and taught me that no matter the odds anything is possible. 

I feel like his death has left a hole in me that will never be filled. I'm adamant to admit it but just thinking about him passing made me cry twice today.

He was a legend, an icon and an amazing scientist. I will never forget him or what his has taught the world.
Thank you Mr Hawking you will never be forgotten.

I didn't really know where to put this but i had to get this out. My apologies if this is in the wrong place.
$C: I may be pretty late to this but I just wanted to say.


Rest In Peace Stephen Hakwings.
$C: He lost wifi connection
$C: Oh fuck. We‚Äôre on our own now. 
$C: Have they tried turning him off and back on again?
$C: Goodbye to the greatest mind of our time. 
$C: They can just put a new battery in him.
$C: Reddit might have caused his death by jinxing it...

https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/8456sz/why_is_stephen_hawking_alive_if_asl_a_disease_he/
$C: He was such a good skate boarder rip
$C: Life would be funny if it wasn't so tragic.
$C: Wow! I didn‚Äôt expect that.
$C: The world just got a good bit dumber. Absolutely tragic. Rest In Peace. 
$C: Rest in peace to the greatest mind of the past century.
$C: The next generation are going to think of him as I think of Carl Sagan. A great scientist that died just before I was born. What a sad and tragic loss.

Please RIP
$C: Stomach dropped when I read this.. 

R.I.P
$C: [deleted]
$C: @MileHighBrendan: Well, damn, apparently it‚Äôs true. https://t.co/i3RrPZbRJL

How the f*** are we supposed to figure out how the universe works now?!?
$C: Even as a Christian, I deeply respected him for his scientific achievements and passion for his field. Despite our differing views, he will always be a legend in my eyes. RIP Stephen and cheers! üçªüò≠
$C: Well the fucker lived about 40 years longer than he was supposed to
$C: "It would not be much of a universe if it wasn‚Äôt home to the people you love."
$C: All these pandering comments make me lol. The dude was a verified arrogant prick but Reddit is of course acting like the world has lost a piece of the sun.

Whatever.
$C: Rest In Peace, Mr. Hawking. I loved your work and the world will be forever grateful for your accomplishments. We owe so much to you.
$C: Holy shit.  Why is this not top of the sub?

So much more he had to teach us.....
$C: Never has anyone reminded me more to not judge a person by their physical appearance.

Thank you for your decades of contribution, Mr. Hawking. 
$C: Damn that's a huge loss to society in general. R.I.P.
$C: RIP to one of the brightest minds of this generation. It was some of his work that truly inspired me to look to the stars. 
$C: Today has been a eventful day.  
$C: Well this was extremely unexpected. Didn't even consider this man would pass among all the celebs features so frequently in the news
$C: I study ALS, and have a lot of experience with how debilitating Hawking‚Äôs condition is. That‚Äôs for the average patient who lives two to four years after onset, so I can‚Äôt imagine what 50+ years with it must be like. I also can‚Äôt help but marvel at the medical and technological advances that continued to provide such and amazing mind with a connection to the world around it. This man was a testament to the fortitude mankind is capable of, and an absolute exemplar for the miraculous benefit that modern medicine can provide.
$C: One of the greatest minds of our time. It's amazing that he lived for so long despite his circumstances, let alone how much he accomplished. RIP
$C: A shame, he was very useful to the world. He will be missed. 
$C: This is so depressing
$C: Didn't realize he was that old. But of course he was.
$C: God speed Mr. Hawking..
$C: Shit, I'm really gutted by this. Such unexpected news. He changed our world, and it's so hard to think that he's no longer with us. Truly one of the greatest minds of our time, may he rest in peace.
$C: We truly have lost one of the greatest minds of human history. 
$C: What??? Insane. 
$C: Been taking a course in Einstein's general relativity this semester; nothing else has made me appreciate just how fucking good at physics Hawking was, to be able to actually understand the stuff well enough to build on it in the way that he and Penrose did. Our prof briefly mentioned a way of understanding Hawking radiation earlier today and it just sailed right over everyone's heads.
$C: RIP to one of the most brilliant minds of our generation.
$C: So sad to lose him but he added so much to our knowledge of the universe.
$C: People got really upset when Prince died. I know now how they feel.
$C: Damn. Wasn't he supposed to die like in his 20s? Impressive that he made it that long, dude was really quite spectacular.
$C: Incredibly surreal. I was thinking about him and his work just 20-30 minutes before I received the news. 

Incredible physicist and an even better person. I am happy to have learned a lot about him since I was a kid.
$C: Damn that was unexpected.  I thought he‚Äôd be with us a while longer :(


I really liked him.

$C: Well, he had a hell of a run, especially with as many health problems as he had. Say what you want about him, but he was one smart SOB. See you starside.
$C: He was very inspirational to me. I want to see many more follow his path.
$C: One of those giants that we all stood on, no matter our station. He finally knows what‚Äôs beyond a black hole. Quick... save his brain! 
$C: He left the world a more enlightened place, which is a heck of a gift. 
$C: Now he‚Äôs free, and I hope he‚Äôs exploring the universe, and finding wonders we haven‚Äôt even dreamed of yet. 
$C: Thank you Stephen Hawking.
$C: He inspired so many people to love and explore. Few people have changed the world as he has. 
$C: A truly great mind, R.I.P
$C: This is tragic. Hawking is one of the few people you can say is wholly good. 
$C: Incredibly sad.

He was a man who changed many lives and inspired many people.
$C: What a life.  Who could have imagined he'd have lived this long with his condition.  He will be greatly missed.
$C: Inspired me to think outside the norm and got me into computer science. A man who I will truly miss.
$C: Damn...he achieved so much with such setbacks. A great man of our times. RIP
$C: Seeing that he lived until 76 makes me kinda happy. Considering that his ALS was supposed to kill him decades ago. R.I.P to one of the greatest minds of out generation.
$C: My dad took me to see the documentary *A Brief History of Time* when I was far too young to understand it.    The joy of getting what I could absorb and the mystery of an entire universe beyond my grasp helped to inform a lifetime of curiosity.   I was just thinking this weekend how much fun it is to do the same thing to my four year old and watch him try to wrap his head around those ideas that are still to big for him.   Thanks for giving so many of us that sense of wonder and RIP.
$C: God damn I didn't even know he was coming to an end or struggling with anything other than motor neuron. What a loss. I always wished he'd had more time to do science without the limitation of his disability, as accomplished as he is in spite of it, who knows what he could have done unimpeded. 
$C: What a brilliant, beautiful mind. He's returned back to the stars üåü  Rest in peace, Dr. Hawking. 
$C: Truly an era has ended. 
$C: Honestly... it's a modern miracle he lasted as long as he did. He lived an incredible life with so much borrowed time that he was able to die at the average age of death. He will go down in history among the greats like Galileo and Einstein.

Rest in peace, Stephen.
$C: Wow man, I was just talking about him yesterday. Weird day.
$C: > Four years later, Hawking married Elaine Mason, one of the nurses employed to give him round-the-clock care. Mason was the former wife of David Mason, who designed the first wheelchair-mounted speech synthesiser Hawking used. 

Wow TIL.

Also, is he having his brain cryogenically frozen like he said he would?
$C: Fools. He has transferred his consciousness into his computer and will be the one greeting us on Mars when we finally get there.
$C: If anyone hasn't already, I highly recommend reading his book 'A Brief History of Time'. Its one of his greatest writings imo.
$C: I've lost half a dozen people I know and love to motor nurone disease. 

Fuck that disease and everything about it. I hope none of you ever have to endure that in any form whatsoever. It is cruel beyond belief and the fact that Hawking spat in its face for so many years gives me hope there one day might be a cure.  

RIP.
$C: Thanks for changing history.
$C: Incredible that he was able to fight ALS for so long. Great man, a pioneer. Will be missed. 
$C: I have no idea why I thought he'd live for another 30-40 years. 
$C: This is an incredible loss for the world.
$C:  I thought he's gonna be immortal 
$C: Rest In Peace to a legend. 
$C: Given how long he lived and how much he accomplished (especially in spite of his difficulties), this doesn't really feel sad. With him you can feel good about life instead of sad about death.
$C: His survival story makes him a remarkable story by itself, and on top of that he was one of the most brilliant physicists that ever lived. 
$C: I honestly thought he would live forever 
$C: This is depressing. At least he doesnt have to see the rise of skynet. RIP old man.
$C: This is one of the deaths that we will remember the exact place we were at when we heard about it. Rest in peace Mr.  Hawkins, you'll always remain one of the giants on whose shoulders future scientists will stand. 
$C: It‚Äôs really sad to see such a brilliant mind go. I hope he loved every minute of the miraculous 76 years he had on this planet, we all cherished them very much. He will be remembered forever through the reverberations he has created in the scientific community. 
$C: How long was he expected to live? Like only a few years after he was diagnosed? That is amazing. He's contributed so much with all these years he's had. RIP. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XfcC6FYyL4U Check him out doing Monty Python.
$C: The guy was absolutely brilliant. Wonder when we'll see someone as smart as him again
$C: "My expectations were reduced to zero when I was 21. Everything since then has been a bonus" - S.H.
$C: A great loss for the world. He was as titanic in science as he was indomitable of spirit. RIP. 
$C: One of the greatest minds and most resilient spirits this world has ever seen. RIP Dr. Hawking.
$C: > Professor Hawking died peacefully at his home in Cambridge, England in the early hours of this morning, family says. 


Thankful he could pass peacefully. Condolences to family and friends. Rest easy Professor.
$C: A death hasn't left me this stunned in a long time, hope he's in a better place
$C: "Look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious."
$C: Here‚Äôs to you, Mr. Hawking. A true inspiration to all of the scientific community. You will be missed!
$C: Wow, holy shit. One of the greats!
$C: Wait, there's so much more of the universe to explore... maybe if we keep on exploring and exploring, we'll meet him again.

See you on the other side of the stars, Mr Hawking.
$C: Could anyone list out some accomplishments that Stephen Hawking made? I‚Äôm trying to explain who he is to my friend and i‚Äôm struggling haha
$C: Out of all the recent celebrity deaths, this one caught me most off guard.  Aside from actors and musicians it is hard to accept the passing of such brilliant minds that have shaped the way in which we perceive the world. Rest in peace to a beautiful soul and phenomenal mind.
$C: How he survived so many years with ALS is truly remarkable. Of course, this pales in comparison to all the achievements he made during his life.
$C: May his sleep be peaceful 
$C: Aww man. Rest In Peace Mr. Hawking!
$C: Sad news. The man is a legend. 
$C: "Not only does God play dice, but... he sometimes throws them where they cannot be seen."
$C: time for everyone on facebook to become a fan of astrophysics overnight. he was truly one of the greatest people in modern history.
$C: the Milky Way just lost one of it's brightest stars.
$C: Rest in peace Mr Hawking.
$C: Sad for those who will grow up knowing him as a historical figure and not someone who lived during their lifetime. 
$C: Pour one out for the homie
$C: holy shit does anyone know what his finals words were
$C: It shouldn't be surprising, especially living with ALS for so long, but it still is.
$C: My god.. you're kidding me..
$C: RIP. You are, no doubt, one of the greatest minds ever to grace   humanity. We thank you for all that you've done for us.
$C: This is incredibly sad.
$C: That's really, really sad.
$C: Benny Benassi will be played in our house tonight in memory.
$C: The global average IQ just dropped a point.
$C: Truly hurt by his passing....but man did he teach me to LIVE. Grateful to have ever experienced one of humanity‚Äôs greatest minds. üíî
$C: Newton, Einstein, and Hawking. His name will go down as one of the greatest minds in human history. Thank you for progressing mankind to where we as a species should strive to be.
$C: RIP to a lot of people's inspiration to pursue science, including me. He was truly a legend and is the modern day Einstein and Newton. To the stars, Stephen Hawking!
$C: RIP.

Your work is done.

We didn't deserve you, but I hope we do great things with your accomplishments.
$C: ‚ÄúIt would not be much of a universe if it wasn‚Äôt home to the people you love.‚Äù 

Sad day.
$C: Man. This one hurts. 

Thank you, Stephen, for everything you‚Äôve contributed to mankind. We miss you already.
$C: Well fuck. Love you forever Mr Hawking. 
$C: Holy shit I can't believe it..I just finished reading his book a few weeks ago. I saw him on TV as a kid and he was one of the first people who got me interested in science, and has led to me pursuing a degree in Physics. RIP. We lost an insanely bright mind
$C: May you walk again, among the stars. RIP
$C: He inspired me to study Physics. 

He will be thoroughly missed.
$C: Humanity just got a lot less smart. RIP
$C: Damn, gonna miss all those Stephen Hawking cameos. May his voice live on in Microsoft SAM!
$C: Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.
$C: I was thinking of how it never dawned on me that he would die one day, before realizing he hasn't. His contributions are immortal. RIP
$C: I will never forget his legendary cameo on The Simpsons too.
$C: He honestly looked younger than that. Suprising.
$C: One of the greatest men on this Earth, rest in peace.
$C: Truly an inspiration for generations to come. Saddened to hear about this.
$C: Damn. I read *A Brief History Of Time* a few years ago, and I had to re-read like every sentence several times before moving to the next, and I probably only understood a tiny tiny percentage of what I read--but it was *still* a thoroughly enjoyable and engaging read. 

Thanks for all you contributed to the world, Mr. Hawking. You will be missed. 
$C: Well...shit. He lived way longer than anyone could have ever expected. He led an extraordinary life, and I'm glad to have shared the planet with him.
$C: Given that he was "supposed" to die a long time ago, it shouldn't be too surprising... But it's still pretty surprising.
$C: One of the greatest of our time, a truly remarkable man and one i look up to to this day. I'm sad i'll never get to meet my hero but glad for everything he left for us.

R.I.P. Mr Hawking
$C: Today is a really sad day for those who love science 
$C: Rest in peace to an incredible mind and an inspiration for many to pursue science and keep exploring the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible.
$C: RIP Dr. Hawking. Newton and Einstein will be there to assist you out of your chair.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEa7CfPaCRw
$C: Jesus. I was not ready to read this. RIP Stephen Hawking. 
$C: Let's not forget the time [he threw a party to prove time travel is impossible.](https://youtu.be/elah3i_WiFI)    What a legend. It seems no matter the subject, as long as it is space related, Stephan Hawking's name comes up. 
$C: Wow, I always knew this day would come but I still wasn't prepared for it... Hes inspired millions of people and it feels the world is that much worse off without him :(
$C: He was a living legend. Goodbye Dr. Hawking
$C: "A History of Time" was easily the most formative book in my childhood. He fought the good fight. 
$C: Just wondering, who is the smartest person alive now? 
$C: He did so much for science, RIP to one of the greatest minds ever.
$C: I knew this would happen in my lifetime but damn I wasn't expecting now.  I'm going to miss you Mr. Hawking.
$C: Honestly didn't expect this at all. He will be missed.
$C: ‚ÄúQuiet people have the loudest minds.‚Äù 

Said by someone who had such a loud mind his words will be reverberating for the rest of time.


$C: Amazing he lived long enough to die an old man.
$C: An absolute groundbreaking legend whose legacy will live forever, RIP.
$C: Sorry to hear this news. Thank you Mr. Hawking for giving us a brief history of time. And for helping mankind better understand this amazing universe.
$C: A great mind we have lost at such a tumultuous time in history. May he rest in peace. 
$C: I just saw him in Futurama.

RIP to a great, multifaceted individual.
$C: Not where I saw this day going.

Anyway, here's to the guy who championed science to the masses and pushed the boundaries of human knowledge.
$C: For some reason I thought he would never die
$C: He will be missed.  Truly one of the greatest minds this world has ever seen
$C: RIP you brilliant mind. The world is going to miss you.
$C: Rest in peace Stephen Hawking. He struggled his whole life with his illness and he never let it stop his brilliance. 
$C: Goodnight Sweet Prince 
$C: A lot of people saving he lived a full life and longer than expected, and that‚Äôs true, but he‚Äôll still be sorely missed and I wish he could have stayed around longer. I grew up with his books and a brief history of time was a huge inspiration to me and millions of others. Rest In peace. 
$C: A true inspiration and icon.
$C: I grew up looking at hawking as the next living, breathing Albert Einstein. A testament and respect to science, physics and our general understanding of the universe. Crazy to think we lost such a brilliant mind. 
$C: Rest in peace, you magnificent wheelchair genius. :(
$C: What an absolute gift this man was to the scientific community. While he may not have intentionally tied to popularise science, you cannot argue that that he did through his work. Vale Stephen Hawking. 
$C: I've always wondered what it was like Einstein died. I guess Hawking passing would be our generations Einstein.
$C: He pushed me and then just touched me, until I got my satisfaction.
$C: Damn! But he lived longer and better than a lot of healthy folks. 
$C: The world has truly lost a genius. Rest In Peace Mr. Hawking
$C: The article mentions that he was a "great scientist" and then goes on to acknowledge him through the movie *The Theory of Everything* and his cameos in "The Big Bang Theory"...

I'd say he's a little bit more accomplished than that.

May he rest in peace.
$C: It's easy to forget how old he lived, all things considered.  But still not long enough.

Rest in peace.
$C: He was especially lucky to live as long as he did with his condition but it's still just so disheartening. 
$C: >We each exist for but a short time, and in that time explore but a small part of the whole universe.

Stephen Hawking, *The Grand Design*

We can all thank Stephen for being a leader and major contributor in the expedition into the universe.
$C: I thought he was going to live forever despite his condition...
$C: A man I'll tell my kids about as one of the greats. I'm proud to have been alive during his time. 
$C: Rest In Peace to a truly great person
$C: He destroyed his life expectancy. So fortunate to live that long and witness all the advancements in his field . 
$C: well.....that is now what i was expecting to read before bed tonight.....wow.....just........He was one of those guys you thought would never die, never thought about that idea that he COULD, even despite his disease.
$C: Rest In Peace to one of the greatest brains. Imagine if he wasn‚Äôt limited by his own body. 
$C: First time I've honestly been emotional over the death of a famous person. He's been such an inspiration to me and sparked my interest in the sciences at a young age. The world will never forget you or your legacy, Dr. Hawking.
$C: press f to pay respects
$C: We lost someone who looked up to the stars for guidance. RIP. 
$C: Unexpected & very sad news. Lost a great mind today. 
$C: rest in peace to an incredible man
$C: Omg. I mean, I knew his health wasn't the best, but this blindsided me so much. 

Rest in Peace, Mr. Hawking.
$C: Wow this caught me off guard - RIP
$C: Nothing I could say would be adequate for the man we lost, all I can think to say is... fuck.
$C: he did amazing things for the human race despite his struggles, he certainly won life. rest easy.
$C: What about the AI wheelchair?
$C: Incredible how long he‚Äôs lived with ALS, an inspiration 
$C: One of those deaths I sort of knew was coming, but am still shocked and surprised. Rest in peace to a brilliant mind and a true pioneer of science.
$C: Wow I audibly gasped when I read this.  Shocking, but not shocking at the same time, I guess.
$C: He was loved across the world. He did so much for us
$C: Say hello to Feynman and Sagan for me, Stephen :(
$C: One of the greatest minds of the last century Rest In Peace 
$C: That moment you see a Reddit post and go screaming for your father..
$C: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not afraid of death, but I‚Äôm in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first.‚Äù

Well you certainly accomplished that goal, Dr. Hawking. Thank you for bringing us all along on your ride and teaching us so much about the universe and what it means to overcome adversity in the process. 
$C: just.. what a great man...
RIP Mister Hawking
$C: An absolute icon for the all the right reasons.
$C: What an inspiration to us all, both in wisdom and spirit. Rest in peace. 
$C: RIP Stephen Hawking, one of the most brilliant minds to have walked the earth. Thank you for all your contributions. You will not be forgotten.
$C: What a shame such a tenuous mind leave this world.... at least he knows what comes after we die, the ultimate question 
$C: Wow.

A lot of monumental people past away last year but this one really hits. He defied odds and proved to be one of the most impactful people in the last 100 years.
$C: He's the bar. He's the kind of person that left an impact on the world that should inspire all of us to try to do the same.
$C: I love him. This is sad

$C: If you haven't already seen it, watch Theory of Everything to get an idea of what an incredible life he lived. The world has lost arguably the greatest scientist of our time. 
$C: I've had a bad week. I didn't need to see this but I'll do my best. It won't be anywhere near his best, but it's mine
$C: I had no idea he was 76! He lived a full life and defied many odds. 
$C: ‚ÄúThe universe does not allow perfection.‚Äù RIP
$C: Holy shit, can't even believe this 
$C:  An extraordinary man whose work and legacy will live on for many years. RIP
$C: He‚Äôs was a badass dude with a badass brain.
$C: What a phenomenal human being. Thank you for your outstanding work.
$C: Rest in peace to a man who has beat the odds for as long as he could.
$C: 95% of famous deaths don‚Äôt even phase me, but this one really hits me hard. RIP.
$C: This man was nothing short of brilliant. RIP good sir.
$C: RIP Mr. Hawking, hope you now get to explore the cosmos unencumbered. You will be missed. 
$C: I guess it‚Äôs kinda poetic going out on Albert Einstein‚Äôs birthday. 
$C: An amazing scientist who has contributed so much to our modern understanding of science. He surpassed the average life expectancy of those with ALS by over 50 years, but it's a real shame that he is now gone. RIP.
$C: In a day and age where science is being devalued more and more everyday, it‚Äôs sad to see such a prolific and barrier-breaking individual pass away. RIP.
$C: He was on The Big Bang Theory and The Simpsons multiple times!

May you rest in peace, wonderful physicist.
$C: a man way ahead of his time. r.i.p
$C: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge."

Words that hold so true today...
$C: A pillar of humanity has been lost today. Rest in peace you brilliant bastard.
$C: Lived way past what everyone thought he would, overcame obstacles in life and went far beyond what anyone could imagine. Rest in peace
$C: My heart and mind hurt
$C: Well, now he‚Äôs up in the cosmos :(
$C: "The Universe in a Nutshell" got me interested in the cosmos...such a loss. He was such an inspiration even for those not directly in the field
$C: Well, that's the last time I post [something like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/831pxh/who_is_still_alive_that_will_surprise_most_people/). RIP Stephen Hawking. 
$C: Press F to pay respects
$C: Wow! The science world just lost a giant! RIP
$C: Rest in Piece, Mister Hawking. You lived far longer and contributed far more to the world than any of us could have hoped. So long, and thanks for all the fish.
$C: Truly a brilliant man and a gift to this world. He will be greatly missed.
$C: This is incredibly sad news. I feel really caught off guard by this, i've read and watched quite bit of his content. The world has truly lost one of the greats.
$C: I hope science cloned his mind for future purpose. RIP. 
$C: I‚Äôm not the biggest into science but I looked at my watch in disbelief when I saw the news that he died. First time I‚Äôve ever done that. 
$C: FUCK this sucks :( literally one of the greatest minds of our time. Rest in peace.
$C: What an inspirational man. He will be missed
$C: Wow, I'm tearing up... did not expect this at all. :(
$C: 76 is an extremely good age for a man with his disease. RIP
$C: Oh no, this is so sad  :(
$C: This is sad. One of the most influential human beings to ever have lived. RIP Mr Hawking.
$C: I like how OP just mostly posts about eminem and then somehow finds this first. #1 spot here we come... RIP dr. hawking
$C: The world is a little less wonderous without him.
$C: We are blessed as a species to have had him on this earth for so long to educate us, to entertain us, and to drive research into several of humanity's ills - ALS, and our lack of knowledge of the cosmos.
$C: Wow. Unexpected. Glad he lived as long and successful of a life as he did
$C: Rest In Peace. Thank you for helping the world become a better place.  
$C: Despite his setbacks, he made the most of what he had, and he made history. RIP.
$C: I wonder if he has any unfinished research that he just didn't have time to complete because of his condition. 
$C: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge."

Safe travels amongst the cosmos, Stephen
$C: Whenever I read up on him or heard of him as a kid, I thought him as a hero. 

Rest in peace and thanks for your contributions.
$C: It‚Äôs weird‚Äîno one will ever again be able to use that voice.  It‚Äôs his forever, I think.
$C: ‚ÄúIt would not be much of a universe if it wasn‚Äôt home to the people you love.‚Äù
$C: Holy shit.  His death was so overdue that I kind of forgot how old he was.
$C: Just watched the old Star Trek TNG episode wherein he plays poker with Data, Einstein, and Newton. RIP.
$C: All hawks eventually have to fly.
$C: What a massive loss for the world. RIP to one of the greatest minds
$C: He contributed so much. RIP Professor Hawking.
$C: As one Giant falls, a position is to be filled by the next Giant of our time.
$C: The year science died.
$C: It hurts, but we were lucky to have him as long as we did. He truly left an impact on the world, and it's one I don't think will be forgotten. RIP.

"*Although I cannot move, and I have to speak through a computer, in my mind I am free.*"
$C: Damn. What an incredible man. What an incredible loss.
$C: Holy crap I honestly thought he was in his like 40's - 50's.

Extremely sad about this news.
$C: i didnt realize it until right now but some people feel like immortal in our society. it just never occurred to me that this man would die in my lifetime
$C: One of the great geniuses and scientific minds of this past century. He lived an amazing life against all odds. Respect to an amazing man and RIP.
$C: If time travel were possible, he would have already told himself today's date. Hawking wins again. RIP
$C: Deeply sorry for his family's loss. I sincerely hope that others in the scientific community can carry on and explore the cosmos for him and for us.
$C: Well maybe now he can go work on finding out how the universe was before the Big Bang. RIP
$C: I wouldn't believe this headline if I found it on FB, but this is Reddit so :(
$C: On the shoulders of giants
$C: A Brief History of Time is a Masterpiece.  I suggest everyone here reads it.
$C: I can't believe I won't see that smile again
$C: Well, I did not expect this. RIP. 
$C: Rest in peace, Mr. Hawking, and thank you dearly for what you brought to the world. None of us ever have excuses seeing how you overcame such challenges to continue to contribute to the scientific community.

/tears.
$C: They should send his remains into space.
$C: His mind kept going until his body could not. Great respect for him. 
$C: I am one with the Force and the Force is with me. 
$C: How will round-earthers ever recover
$C: Respects.  I don't have much to say, but the world somehow feels dumber.  He was a smart man who spent some time rehearsing the stupid so that we all may understand a little more, have a little more truth.  Internal hero, for sure.
$C: Holy shit. He was such an extraordinary individual. RIP
$C: Can anyone recommend a good SH documentary? I've always wanted to see him speak live but ill never have that chance now :(  
$C: Good night, sweet prince
$C: It‚Äôs insane how much he contributed to science. He was able to make physics enjoyable for people who weren‚Äôt deep into theoretical physics. I learned a lot from his shows growing up. Sad day....
$C: The world is now one step closer to an Idiocracy.
$C: I'm sure I speak for many when I say this man played a huge part in creating a spark in many minds and has truly changed the world as we see it. Truly an inspiration to myself, and so many others. May there be many more who follow in his tracks. Rest in Peace, Professor. 
$C: One of the greatest minds since Einstein. RIP.
$C: What a sad day for science and a sad day for this world. Things already seemed a little dark, we will all miss such an individual who made it so much brighter.
$C: Such a brilliant man. Vale Professor Hawking.
$C: I imagine what I'm feeling is how people felt when Einstein passed.
$C: Well it's a heck of a time to leave this planet.
I hope he rests peacefully among the stars.
$C: "A wise man's teachings pass on long after his death, a foolish man's teachings are made immediate because he sets a sled on fire and rides down the stairs" - Stephen Hawking
$C: For anyone not realizing, he died on 3/14, pi day
$C: Thanks for giving us all, rest in peace hawking. We will remember you.
$C: Great man, I remember his apperance on The Simpsons. First time I learned of him.
$C: My hero is gone. RIP mr hawken 
$C: Damn. He'll be missed. Rest in Peace. 
$C: damn I forgot how old he was. RIP legend
$C: This is one of those events you look back on when you‚Äôre older and remember. Sad day. 
$C: Words...I, I just can't
$C: When my friend told me, I thought he was joking - I thought Hawking would live forever. Alas, fate has it that he will be one with the universe now.
$C: RIP Prof. Hawking, and thank you for opening my mind with *A Brief History of Time.*
$C: Hopefully his work gets even more recognition! Thanks for all the science!!
$C: You were a gift to all of humanity. You will never be forgotten. Rest In Peace Mr. Hawking.
$C: Putin has really gone too far now.
$C: such an amazing human that will live on forever through his work 
$C: Wow that's a real bummer.
$C: The meaning of life is to find your gift, the purpose of life is to give it away... 

A quote I read once.
I have no doubt this man found his purpose. 

May your soul forever rest in peace!
$C: One of the greatest scientific minds in history. He was the Einstein of our time.
$C: Another great one us humans didn't deserve. RIP. 
$C: Well this has made redditing in bed before sleep suck. 
$C: I remember reading his book "A Brief History of Time" in 10th grade and knew instantly I had to learn more.  He inspired a whole generation of scientists.  Massive loss for humanity.
$C: He lived much longer than he was expected to, I don't remember how young, but it was certainly nothing near the 70s. I wonder how much longer it would take to know the things he has contributed to astrophysics. 
$C: Wow... Humanity lost a great one today...

F
$C: "Look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonders about what makes the universe exist. Be curious" 

Rest in Peace to an amazing human being. Thank you for all that you added to our world and knowledge of our universe. 
$C: For anyone not realizing, he died on 3/14, pi day
$C: Really wish he would‚Äôve lived a bit longer to see so many more great accomplishments in the upcoming year especially with Elon Musk leading the way. What a shame but he‚Äôll always be watching. RIP to a great guy and father. Leaving his family behind must‚Äôve been so hard but he‚Äôs done so much for us already. 

You will be missed
$C: To many a superhero wears a cape but my superhero wore a chair. I'm going to miss you Mr. Hawking.
$C: First time I've honestly felt sincere "loss" from the death of someone not related to me.. feels strange
$C: I will never forget being purely starstruck watching *Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking* for the first time. This man inspired a true love and appreciation for science within me and millions of others. May he never be forgotten. RIP
$C: A true story of perseverance, he was told he has 2 years to live, defied all odds live 55 years more and is one of the greatest people of all time. He changed the way people look at so much. May he Rest In Peace and explore the universe he inspired so many to think about.
$C: Fuck this is heartbreaking
$C: Absolute legend of our time that has left us too soon. Amazing he lasted this long and has left a great legacy behind him.
$C: (Looks for a "Speak N Spell" to send out condolence message)
$C: Man, really sad to hear. He definitely was a fighter and an innovator. So inspiring to me growing up, really glad we each had a chance to learn from his work in some way.

Definitely going to revisit Into the Universe.
$C: His death is something everyone was expecting, but for it to actually happen feels oddly unexpected.
$C: I'm healthy and dumb. Never making to 76.
He took a shitty hand and played the hell out out of it. RIP.
$C: Rest In Peace Stephen. You‚Äôve had quite the life and I‚Äôm sad to see him go and for some reason I feel like he didn‚Äôt want to go yet either. With a brain like his I think he would‚Äôve wanted to be alive when we would acknowledge the existence of aliens or something. It‚Äôs a damn shame :(
$C: He was a remarkable man. He should have died in his 20/30‚Äôs and lived to be 76. Seemed very humble as well. Rest in peace Stephen, never let your disability stop you from accomplishing great things. 
$C: A truly brilliant man that history will place among the ranks of Einstein, Newton, Galileo, to name a few. Rest In Peace Mr. Hawking!  
$C: "Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change." -Stephen Hawking. This man was afflicted with one of the worst diseases, but he adapted to the change and proceeded to change the world. And thus, his status as one of the most intelligent men to walk amongst us was only solidified. R.I.P. Mr. Hawking, you will be missed.
$C: Quite incredible that he lived as long and well as he did considering his illness. He's been an immense asset to science and humanity and he will be missed. A true inspiration. 
$C: His phrase ‚ÄúThe greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the ilusi√≥n of knowledge‚Äù has always helped me improve. He will be missed 
$C:  On Pi day?
$C: Oh damn.
Rest In Peace my amazing dude.
$C: I guess it's time to pull out my copy of a Brief History of Time. 
RIP Dr. Hawking.

$C: Was he not already dead wtf?! 
$C: So sad to finally be hearing this. But as other people are saying... he lived a long time for his diagnosis. And he got a fuck of a lot done.

Rest in peace dude, thanks so much for your contributions to progress humanity. 
$C: He was such an inspiration to me. I‚Äôm really sad about this news. 
$C: RIP. Always sad to see another one of my childhood heroes lose to time.
$C: He has one of the strongest backs to hold up everyone standing on his shoulders
$C: Damn, I'm not even a scientist and I was thinking about how awesome he is just last night after watching some random motivational videos about people like him.

A legend imo.
$C: May he rest amongst the stars
$C: I just watched the recent film. What a life. What a man. I know he wasn‚Äôt into religion but graciously worked with the Vatican and was a member of its pontifical academy. RIP and hope he has slipped the bonds of earth to touch the face of god.

https://youtu.be/0RdvRJGl-_w 
$C: A man with limited abilities, who originally had limited time, gave the world so much than we deserve. The things he brought to this world will last many lifetimes. RIP
$C: I guess his 'time' had come...
$C: Oh, fuck. Disability claimants nationwide are probably shitting themselves now one of the few credible arbiters for their cause has now passed.

RIP Stephen Hawking, a brilliant mind and a well intentioned man whose work was not yet over but whose legacy will remain indelibly as part of our history and scientific advancements. 
$C: One of the last photos of him

https://imgur.com/a/Z6AEr
$C: Wtf. As a Physicists, this fucking ruined my day. 
$C: He helped to inspire a generation of thinkers: scientists and philosophers alike. He will continue to live on through his work and theories. RIP. 
$C: god damn boys and girls we lost a treasure tonight he was one of my true hero never fear what the end has to offer embrace it with open arms and never know what true fear is in the first place 
$C: what an inspiration. Honor to have shared the earth with you, Mr. Hawking, may you rest in peace.
$C: Just to think how much he left with us despite his condition and the odds he had to face is beyond inspiring. No doubt one of the most influential in the community of science, and it‚Äôs sad to see him go. 
$C: Russia has killed our only hope of winning world war 3
$C: RIP

What a collosal loss for mankind
$C: He had the voice of a robotic angel, terrible dancer though.
Seriously though, Rest In Peace, you have made an increadible impact not he world and modern science, you will be missed.
$C: damn. I honestly thought he might outlive us all.
$C: His Wiki page is about to get so many reads. 
$C: One of the smartest , greatest and most inspiring people of this century. Big loss for humanity.
$C: This might be one of the first "celebrity" deaths in a while to really catch me off guard. Him and Michio Kaku were the main reasons why I initially went to college as a Physics major. ~~I eventually changed but that's really not relevant~~
$C: no no no no. Come on, no. Fuck. Just, fuck man, was he sick? What the fuck. 
$C: Sad loss, he was one of my influences to go study physics.
$C: One of the most interesting people to ever live! So bummed he‚Äôs gone so soon. RIP
$C: Rest in paradise. This generation was blessed with a beautiful mind. 
$C: This is such a sad news for the scientific world. Considering the fact how smart he was, I only hope that the people he was working with were able to grasp as much ideas and knowledge from this genius. 

No matter the condition he was in he was able to have a good life and great people that supported him. Moreover, the respect that he got was earned through hard work and dedication. 

I can add this that he was able to raise awareness  for the disabled people as well. No matter the disability you can achieve great things when your hard work and dedication is set for them. 
$C: At a time when we needed him most. Rest in peace.
$C: We lost a beautiful mind. His name will live on with the greats. 
$C: 20 minutes. Almost 1000 comments. This'll get buried.
$C: Guess he'll know the answer to his question now. 
$C: A legendary man. Its sad to see him gone :(
$C: We lost a jewel of our time
$C: Rest in peace Mr Hawking you were a true icon. 
$C: That voice machine is totally going to keep talking and spitting out new ideas. 
$C: Damn. He did a great AMA. I recommend you check it out.
$C: "However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at."

Doctors said he had 2 years to live 55 years ago. He was truly an inspiration.
$C: Sleep tight and godspeed. Truly a great lost.
$C: He was a legendary man, and I consider myself privileged to have lived during the same time that he was revolutionizing our understanding of the universe. 
$C: Peace sir, I am sure your headed to space sooner or later, just like the rest of us.  
$C: "We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn‚Äôt want to meet." -Stephen Hawking.


A revelation in science and a legend to the scientific community. He will be missed by all. 
$C: Truly a person that will be remembered for the next millennia that‚Äôs for sure. There with Galileo, Newton and Euler. 
$C: Super sad... really wanted to know how many licks it takes to the center of a tootsie roll... how will the world ever know now?!?
$C: The world lost a great man today. Rest in Peace good sir 
$C: The way in which you lived out your life inspired many people and a great lesson to learn what it means to struggle both physically and intellectually. RIP
$C: He was given 2 years to live at the age of 21 in 1963. He lived 55 more years and is the far and away the biggest name in modern science. What an incredible life. Rest in peace Mr. Hawking.
$C: Just as I was about to go to bed I see this... Rest in piece to a true legend
$C: Damn RIP to one of the greatest minds who ever lived. 
$C: Wow, it really feels empty now without him. He was such an icon. I remember watching him on the History Channel as a kid. The scene where he talks about time travelers coming to his party still stays with me to this day.
$C: Lived long enough to see a movie made about him, and still did many great things for science. 
$C: Truly a day that marks a great loss in history.
$C: Aw man, I hope he was a Philly Eagles fan. RIP!
$C: He will be greatly missed.
$C: I hope they don't just have the stairway to heaven.
$C: Physically not theoretically.
$C: One of the greatest minds this world has ever seen. It's sad that he died, but it's incredible that he could survive this long. 
$C: He is now Stephen *Hawked*
$C: Damn, this was so sudden. Whenever I hear this kind of news I always have to look it up, so I come here and... Unbelievable. RIP Mr. Hawking. 
$C: ÿ•ŸÜÿß ŸÑŸÑŸá Ÿà ÿ•ŸÜÿß ÿ•ŸÑŸäŸá ÿ±ÿßÿ¨ÿπŸàŸÜ

RIP


$C:  - Life would be tragic if it weren't funny. - Stephen Hawking
$C: This fucking sucks. May you rest in peace among the brightest and most brilliant stars in the universe. You are already missed. 
$C: He'll be up there with Albert Einstein and other prominent and outstanding thinkers before long. 
$C: I wonder how long it took for them to notice he was dead. 
$C: This was one of those deaths, much like Betty White and the Queen, where people for the past ten years have been predicting that "this will be the year they pass." Even though we knew it was coming soon, this one hurts. What gives me peace is that he had a very successful life and left behind a legacy of scientific information that will never be forgotten 
$C: "Look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious."  
  
Thank you for your curiosity, Mr. Hawking.
$C: I had to make a double take. What an amazing legacy to leave the science community
$C: Such an intelligent and inspirational person that was dealt a bad hand and still pushed through to become one of the best scientists we had.
$C: Damn this was really unexpected. RIP.
$C: May he rest in peace. He is no longer suffering :(
$C: He's on the other side now. Wherever and whatever it may be.
$C: This day keeps getting worse.
$C: Holy shit I'm legitimately crying.  I usually don't care about celebrity deaths but this crushes me.  My best friend who passed away last year from a seizure went with me to see Mr. Hawking in 2005.  RIP to them both.
$C: Oh wow. I never really considered his death as something incipient. I guess when you're always that sick, it becomes normal, and you seem like you're healthy even when you're not, in other people's eyes.
$C: not a sentient AI confirmed, whole world breathes sigh of relief



seriously though, amazing he lived that long, shame he didn't live longer. rest in peace stephen. 
$C: This man, himself, has inspired me to go into the sciences. Will remember him and his work dearly.
$C: What a great man that overcame incredible obstacles. RIP Stephen. You made an incredible mark in this world.
$C: Died my butt, he just ascended to the next plane of intelligence that none of us are capable of comprehending. 
$C: Now I know what movie I‚Äôm renting tomorrow.
$C: What a terrible loss. He has provided so much for the scientific community that his value simply could not have been overstated. Thank you, Stephen Hawking.
$C: Whoa that's a big one. RIP.
I hope that 2018 isn't just getting started
$C: Pulls on the heart strings, in theory.
$C: Not sad at all.  He lived a long life and did more than most.  There are tragic deaths; this is not one.  I‚Äôm glad U2 used his voice in their concert so I can say I was jumping up and down rocking to the sound of Hawking.
$C: Damn. That‚Äôs depressing, but just imagine if he had died when he was expected too. I‚Äôm glad we had him as long as we did. He will be missed. May he Rest In Peace.
$C: I‚Äôll be tossing a Panucci‚Äôs pizza in the garbage tonight in his honor. 
$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJH4h1AtItc
$C: Some deaths affect you really deep and leave you numb for the sheer shock it causes you. This is one of them. RIP Legend.
$C: What a magnificent life he led.
$C: ...... 

Rest well, Professor. Thank you for everything.  
Gonna go look at the night sky and cry now. 
$C: Hopefully he can walk now
$C: He will never be forgotten. A wonderfully lived life. Always rising up and exceeding expectations.
$C: You lived a fantastic life Mr. Stephen Hawking... You'll live on in history. 
$C: One of the most iconic, respected, and recognisable voices of this generation who influenced and inspired so many minds. RIP Dr. Stephen Hawking! 
$C: I really wonder how the world will react to this death. It seems like he was the most monumental scientist of the era, and people like him do not come around often. I hope many realize his importance and contributions to his field.
$C: That's a name that will live on for a long, long time. Thank you for your contributions to humanity, Mr. Hawking.
$C: The thought of this happening never crossed my mind. This hit hard. Rest in peace

$C: I will be rewatching all the shows he was in tonight/tomorrow. R.I.P.
$C: omg RIP you beautiful mind, you
$C: RIP; one of the greatest minds of our time.
$C: You are a great man. Thank you for everything.
$C: "Each generation stands on the shoulders of those who have gone before them, just as I did as a young PhD student in Cambridge, inspired by the work of Isaac Newton, James Clerk Maxwell and Albert Einstein."

And now, Stephen Hawking is amongst the giants that came before him, and will inspire the next generation of brilliant minds. Rest in Peace, Dr. Hawking.
$C: ‚ÄúMy goal is simple. It is a complete understanding of the universe, why it is as it is and why it exists at all‚Äù
Thank you for helping us understand the universe. RIP

$C: I really enjoyed hearing what Professor Hawking had to say. Deeply saddened.
$C: Goodnight sweet prince. May you forever live and your ashes be gloriously ejected through a plasma jet one day.
$C: This is one of those moments where I'll remember the moment I read of Mr. Hawking's death.
$C: Legends never die. 

  Rest easy.
$C: RIP Stephen. I will forever miss you. You had a profound impact on how I perceive space. Thank you.
$C: How incredibly sad.

I was in the process of listening to A Brief History of Time. Fascinating read
$C: It's really amazing what this guy was able to do with borrowed time
$C: damn i thought he was immortal
$C: RIP to a legend ‚Äúthose who live in the shadow of death are often those who live most‚Äù you will be missed.
$C: This news hit hard, and makes me cry. 

He inspired so many, to think bigger than ourselves and ponder the universe. 


$C: Nothing but honor and respect , Stephen Hawking was true influence he persevered nothing but service to human kind. A true Scientist. 
$C: He lived over 50 years past his life expectancy, and the world was greater for it.
$C:  No Words.  Truly a spectacular man who overcame every obstacle and lived an amazing life afterwards. Rest In Peace you crazy diamond 
$C: He made incredible contributions to his field and introduced a lot of people to interesting science with books like A Brief(er) History of Time.

Rest in peace.
$C: Rip Stephen Hawking, aww he died in pie day (3.14)
$C: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! DAMMIT!! He lived up to such a great age for his condition, and he should've lived longer. Rest In Peace, Hawking.
$C: A legend who will always be remembered. Plus he died on Pi Day (in the US) of all days. RIP
$C: I was watching a video on reddit about he moon when it popped up on my phone. Weird. RIP
$C: Straight out of left field. I‚Äôm still finding it hard to believe. He was such an influential person, and I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll never be forgotten. Rest In Peace. 
$C: Unbelievable!! I still remember him from the Dexters Labratory episodes.
$C: Stephen Hawking, in my view, has been in the league of Stan Lee and Betty White in that no matter how long we prepare for it, we'll still be caught off guard once they die, as I was when I heard about Hawking's passing. RIP.
$C: First Keith Murray and now this?!?
$C: Damn, for some reason it always felt like he would just keep living through pure force of science, will and renown, despite his condition. I'm sure he will be remembered forever though.
$C: It's a shame that Hawking has passed away, but I am grateful I had the chance to learn about his research within my lifetime. I hope he is at peace, wherever he is.
$C: One of our best, may he Rest In Peace.
$C: Wow. I did not expect this. 
$C: I am proud to have lived in a time where I could know him.  Rest In Peace.
$C: Thank you so much, sir.
$C: Elon needs to send him to space
$C: Rest In Peace, Hawking. You will be remembered as one of the greatest minds this world has ever known. 
$C: Somebody‚Äôs currently got some splainin‚Äô to do...
$C: ‚ÄúIf human life were long enough to find the ultimate theory, everything would have been solved by previous generations. Nothing would be left to be discovered.‚Äù

You, sir, have taken us far enough to find the answers. A loss of a great mind, never to be forgotten. 
$C: Oh no I wish he could have lived long enough to see the first steps humanity taking to colonize mars.

Anyway the world will never forget him. Even after having such a disability he did not lose hope and became one of the most famous scientists in the world. Truly and inspiration to many.

RIP :(
$C: I feel like he's the Yoda to all the people who believe in science and that he didn't technically die he just phased away from his chair 
$C: Damn, rest in peace to one of the greatest minds of the latest century, he changed how we view the world today.
$C: Well, that was a punch to the gut I didn't expect before bed...  :(
$C: I always knew him as a cultural icon. Never knew really what he pioneered, but I knew he was incredibly well respect. So this oddly made me more sad than I expected. I know I'm  ignorant,  but what is he famous for? I know it's something related to the way we think about the universe 
$C: One brilliant man. May he Rest In Peace. 
$C: I wonder if the thought of God not existing crossed his mind before dying. 
$C: We lost a great man today. Thank you for all your work, Mr. Hawking.
$C: He was a very well known scientist. He will be missed by many. 
$C: This hit me hard, sad to see him go. One of the greatest minds of our time.
$C: RIP Hawking. 

You will be missed. 
$C: This man was one of my greatest inspirations when it came to learning about space. I am deeply saddened by this news. My condolences go out to his friends, family, and everyone who looks up to him.
$C: He has always been and will continue to be the first person who comes to my mind when I hear the word genius. His entire life was a wonder to me. 
$C: Here I am stressing for an interview tomorrow, and I finally get some time to myself, go on reddit and see Mr. Hawking has passed. :( life is a cruel, unpredictable lady.

RIP STEPHEN HAWKING

You accomplished more than anyone could have imagined
$C: It's nice to see pleasant comments here. Thank you for your contributions Dr. Hawking.
$C: In a more optimistic view... you know he's out there cruising through the cosmos. Must be having a blast :') FLY IN PEACE!
$C: RIP :(
We lost a great one
$C: How did they figure it out?? ~~too soon~~
$C: Looks like ill be re-watching "The Theory of Everything" very soon. RIP. 
$C: Thats sad.
Donate money towards ALS research.
$C: "I think the conventional afterlife is a fairy tale for people afraid of the dark." - Stephen Hawking 

Rest in peace! 
$C: Oh god. Such a sad news. Stephen was a great man and we shall remember him. RIP.
$C: Rest in peace, old friend. You brought a lot to the table and we'll never forget you.
$C: This doesn't seem real :( RIP
$C: A true stable genius has left us. You will live forever in our hearts.
$C: Wow, I'm just getting over being all emotionally tender after a break up a month ago and now this
$C: Such an incredible and historic life Stephen Hawking lived. Most amazing man of our time. RIP :(
$C: Wow wasn‚Äôt expecting that. RIP
$C: Probably the greatest mind of this age. Rest in peace.
$C: I was in complete shock to hear this. My goodness. It is such a surprise.
$C: What an incredible life this person led. Faced with a disability that completely immobilized his body, he overcame the odds and became one of, if not the leading researcher in his field. Rest In Peace 
$C: "I have noticed that people who claim everything is predestined, and that we can do nothing to change it, look before they cross the road"
$C: Incredible man who truly left a lasting legacy for all of time, RIP.
$C: I'm having fun just refreshing this page. It's seriously insane how fast it's being upvotes and commented on. 
$C: Inb4 ‚Äúthoughts and prayers‚Äù
$C: Nooooo. I knew he had an illness and that it was already a miracle that he got to live for so long but I was still not prepared to read this news today. I looked at him as one of the Einsteins of this generation. Thank you and rest in peace, good sir.
$C: Almost made it to pi, talk about the circle of life.

In all seriousness though- Can‚Äôt give enough thanks for what this man has done. RIP

$C: at least now he would know the answer to what puzzled him, meet the creator of it all! 
$C: Rest in peace sir. You are now moving to be part of the stars and the cosmos.
$C: RIP Stephen Hawking. Thank you for everything. You will be missed.
$C: Damn, his death is really making my mind hurt 
$C: Mr. Hawking is one of those people that hundreds of years in the future will have a name so immortalized that future generations will have a hard time believing he was real. Rest in peace sir, you were an inspiration to many aspiring scientists such as myself
$C: What a brilliant man and mind. I hope he found all the answers to his questions.
$C: This makes me very sad. RIP to one of the most inspirational people of our generation. Fortunately legends never die and this man left us for a lot to explore.
$C: This made me way more sad than I thought it would RIP. 
$C: Holy fucking shit.

This one is the most devastating of all.
$C: Damn. Sad but not unexpected, he lived to a fairly old age, slowly wasting away with a disease that kills most of those who get it long before he did. Science has lost one of its biggest names.
$C: Holy shit, that hurts. I never saw this coming, the guy seemed invincible.

What a great man, his contributions to physics will be remembered for a very long time. I hope to some day be able to understand what he had to say.
$C: Wow, I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm reading this right now. It almost felt as if he would live on forever. But, the legacy that man has left behind sure will. RIP Stephen Hawking, you inspired millions. 
$C: Rest in peace Mr. Hawking.
$C: One of the greatest minds of all time, lost.
$C: I honestly thought this wasn‚Äôt real at first, what an incredible mind and truly an awful loss for humanity‚Äôs sake. 
$C: ‚ÄúTry to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious, and however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. It matters that you don‚Äôt just give up‚Äù. 

This man fought for every moment to give back to the world he loved. RIP Mr. Hawking. Thank you for everything you accomplished, and everyone you inspired. 
$C: Rest In Peace to a legend
$C: We've lost one of the greatest minds of the last century, and one that will never be forgotten.

Rest in peace Mr. Hawking.
$C: And on Einstein's birthday!?!? C'mon, man!
$C: i knew this day was around the corner for the last 20 years, still very saddened.

We are so lucky his motor neuron disease did not affect his mind.

It would have to be so frustrating to have such a wealth of ideas yet have such difficulty expressing them.

RIP :(
$C: What a man, told he would die at 20, proceeds to prove time had a beginning and define pretty much everything we know about black holes and battle until 76, what a hero.
$C: Lots of threads of ‚Äúwho would crush you if died in 2018‚Äù. For better or worse I never even thought of Mr Hawking. What a life he lived. 
$C: I think if there was a person in the world who proved how powerful a human mind can be and  if you push forward you can achieve your goals it's Stephen Hawking. One of the greatest scientists and a big inspiration. May his legacy live forever.
$C: Wow. What. May take a while to process this. 
RIP ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèº
$C: What an incredible mind and person. You are now among the stars.
$C: Doesn't feel right. For some reason I always thought if there was gonna be a singularity, he'd survive until it. 
$C: Damn, was totally not expecting this when I hit refresh on my webpage. RIP Dr. Hawking. 
$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg8_cKxJZJY
$C: Jeez, I know he had a terminal illness and all,  but I can't believe he's dead
$C: Imagine being given 2 years to live in 1963 and living until 2018.
$C: This is so sad :( but he lived a very long and good life.
$C: RIP Steve, you were the star stuff that shone the way to our future in the stars
$C: All things considered, He had a good run...
$C: I'm going to watch that movie again. 
Y'all know which one 
$C: Rest in peace Dr. Hawking.


$C: This is certainly sad news but my god what a life he lived. Most people could live a hundred lives with perfectly abled bodies and not contribute a fraction what  he did to humanity. RIP Mr. Hawking. 
$C: I'm going to need a moment on this one. Plus I know my mom will be devastated.
$C: Rip Stephen Hawking. He now knows pretty much everything. Lol. Seriously. It's very sad. But he made the most of what he had. Something many people take for granted. A very good man. He will be missed. 
$C: He was such an inspiration for ALS. Man death is lame. 
$C: RIP to one of the greatest minds in history.

What a cruel fucking irony that such a brilliant mind was physically limited as he was.  I'm sure there are no limits to what he could have accomplished had he been able to move, yet even living as he did, a prisoner in his own body for all those years, he still constantly astonished all of us to no end.

RIP Mr. Hawking
$C: u/areallyshitusername will probably get gold for a long time.
$C: My eyes are watering. The world lost a brilliant, beautiful mind.
$C: Stephen Hawking has been an inspiration to the world for his brilliance, his resolve, and the impact he has made on us all. Godspeed, Mr. Hawking. Rest in peace.
$C: We've lost the greatest mind of our time 


$C: Going to listen to Keep Talking tonight in honor of him
$C: Oh no. I thought he might actually be immortal, he should've died over 50 years ago.
$C: My wife who is studying DNR/DNI policy is really curious to the specifics of his end of life. Any details outside if this article?
$C: Wow, I guess I hadn't realized he was that old. To be honest, he'll probably live to be older than I will.
$C: Just a reminder an HD copy of his PhD Thesis at Cambridge can be found here, written at 24 years old.         
         
Hawking, S. (1966). Properties of expanding Universes

$C: "Look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see... " RIP legend
$C: God damn he had to have been ready, the guy lived like 50 years longer than he was ever supposed to and he couldn't move a single part of his body at the end, I'm not even sure if he could blink anymore. He sure had full use of his brain though. He was possibly the smartest man alive.
$C: Damn. Such an inspiration. The future is going to look back upon this man as a scientific icon. I feel so privileged to have lived on this planet at the same time he did. He's this century's Albert Einstein. On wheels.
$C: Rest in peace Dr. Hawking!
$C: pour one out for the OG wheelin and dealin, rubber pealin, physicist on the A-List. His body may be dismissed but his knowledge will persist
$C: RIP, he was an inspiration to me and i'm sure many others 
$C: Just woke up due to having to go to the toilet. What a loss
$C: We were and are privileged to live in his age. He was our Einstein. 
$C: press f for respect

*tts synthesized f*
$C: Remember that he lived far longer than expected.  We can celebrate that his genius was with us for so long.
$C: Someone that has been my inspiration for years, Rest in peace Mr. Hawking
$C: For some reason I didn't think this was coming any time soon. Such a brilliant mind. 
$C: That John Oliver interview was great. RIP to one of the greater minds ever.
$C: Damn man, out of everything happening right now this just came out of left field. Your life was important and will be remembered. Thank you. 
$C: An incredibly important figure in human history, not to mention an incredible odds-defier. Rest in peace Mr. Hawking, you will not be forgotten.
$C: F to pay respects. As in holy Fuck this Fucking sucks. What a loss :(
$C: First time I've been sad about a celebrity death in a while :(

Michael Jackson was the last I can remember, actually
$C: No better example of mind over matter.
$C: We will remember Stephen as we are remembering Einstein, may we continue to discover new things about space and progress humanity in the right direction.
$C: If you haven't read it, his book "A Brief History of Time" is a great read.
$C: Dr Hawking, you made the universe a little more understandable, and improved humanity for the better. Thank you, and rest in peace 
$C: Actually this is hitting me. It's like a connection to the outside universe was cut. 

I hope as a reward he now has all the answers.
$C: Stephen Hawking was one of the few scientists in history that everyone in society could recognize. Absolute unit. Rest in peace man
$C: So amazing he lived as long as he did.  Glad he beat the odds as long as he did.
$C: Fuck man 2018 is off to a really bad start it‚Äôs barely March. 
$C: We lost one of the great ones. Rest in peace Stephen.
$C: damn. this was so unexpected.
$C: God damn. He seemed eternal to me. 
RIP
$C: Very happy we had him in our generation. He was instrumental in discovering many things about earth/space and specifically black holes.
$C: Talk about out of the blue. 

Nothing but love for this man. Truly one of the greatest people to ever live. Rest In Peace Hawking. 
$C: Sometimes I wonder what he could have been capable of if he wasn‚Äôt stricken by such a relentless disease. 
$C: Damn the first time i heard of stephen hawking was ironically through Epic Rap Battles Hawking vs Einstein, he was the reason i got into physics and science for the longest time just such an inspirational man
$C: What an incredible loss. Thank you for all you contributed to the world.
$C: No warp speed for us then:(
$C: Did he just drop dead or was he in a hospital and it was expected?
$C: He‚Äôs not not dead he‚Äôs just tracked to the next dimension.
$C: Had to happen sooner or later. I just always thought it would be later. 
$C: What a great mind this is sad
$C: "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take" Thank you Stephen Hawking
$C: His idea of a doughnut shaped universe was intriguing. I may have to steal it
$C: I thought he'd still be kicking for another 10 years. Does anyone know if he ever retired? 
$C: Gone but never forgotten
$C: A quote by Stephen Hawking
$C: here come the conspiracy theories...  
$C: "Life would be tragic if it weren't funny."
$C: Wow. I never thought I‚Äôd see the death of science in my lifetime.

This is an omen if I ever saw one.
$C: Rest in peace smart science man
$C: [deleted]
$C: Damn I kind of forgot about him until this post..
$C: Rest In Peace, Mr. Hawking. The world was a better, more intelligent place because of your presence. What a loss. 
$C: A truly fierce spirit. We shall not know his like again. 
$C: One of the greatest minds of our time. The average IQ of the world has just gone down a few points. Rest in peace, mate. 
$C: RIP. The science world has lost one of their Titans today.
$C: What a loss to our species. 
$C: He defied the odds and survived while sharing his knowledge with us all. The world is thankful that he lived for this long.
$C: I‚Äôll never forget this inspiration of a man or his contributions to science, Rest In Peace.
$C: Don't feel bad guys! Dude had like 0% chance to live up to 76

He also revolutionized science and I'm sure changed the lives of many

The dude lived a bigger life than most people who live up to 100!

He is probably happier up there too :)
$C: Not only one of the most brilliant minds of all time, but a source of hope and inspiration for those with ALS. I can‚Äôt believe he is gone.
$C: One of the smartest people to ever live, a truly brilliant man. Rest in Peace.
$C: Thanks for making me think about stuff!
$C: Oh wow, he's one of those people I never even considered how old he was. This hit me harder than I thought it would.
$C: RIP Mr. Hawking, he had accomplished incredible things in his lifetime, but my first memory of him was on the simpsons funnily enough https://youtu.be/uIDTQ5BoKP8. 

Through a few other interviews I‚Äôve seen he always had a great sense of humor and seemed a very humble man for how smart he was. 
$C: This must be what it feels like to witness one of the greatest minds in history leave this world. Hawking will truly be missed. He left a void in humanity that will never be filled. Rest in peace.
$C: The things he achieved and contributed to the world will never be forgotten. RIP Mr. Hawkings
$C: Well there goes our future. 
$C: Talk about mental strength.....
$C: Not only does God play dice, but... he sometimes throws them where they cannot be seen.
$C: Not often that news of a death makes me gasp in shock and sadness...but this one did. 

Last one that did that was Robin Williams.

Thank you, Mr Hawking, for all you brought to the world.  May you know peace and may you dance through the stars.
$C: Kind of person that just pops into your head when you are thinking of science. I feel uncomfortable knowing he's gone. Achieved a lot even with a debilitating illness. I hope his family gets the peace and privacy they deserve. RIP
$C: rest in peace, my man. you're one with the stars now
$C: We just lost one of the brightest minds this world will ever know. 
$C: He was truly an inspiring man. He will be remembered for generations to come.
$C: Please can we hide Betty white and everyone else we love. Fuck. 
$C: ‚ÄúTime (whatever that may be) will tell.‚Äù

Such a remarkable mind.
$C: Fuck man. I‚Äôve never really had a celebrity pass away and feel much sadness from it, but this guy finally did it for me. RIP Hawking.
$C: Ah fuck. Just today I was talking about how appreciative I am of the fact that we still have greats like him. 
$C: I was so shocked when I read the news
$C: It always feels sad and weird when a great mind leaves us.
$C: Holy shit, thats crazy. While everyone has made many jokes at his expense he truly was, and still is, one of the most brilliant minds of our time.

$C: Time to rewatch A Theory of Everything and then take the time to re-read A Brief History of Time.
$C: What an incredible, and extraordinary, man. RIP. 
$C: he died on pi day 3/14
$C: Steven Hawking has become one with the universe -- FTFY
$C: A friend just told me, but this is the first post I've  seen on Reddit
$C: The world is a better place for having had the opportunity to know Stephen Hawking.
$C: Sad to hear he passed. Glad he lived a long life though


[Also someone asked about it in /r/NoStupidQuestions 10 hours prior](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/8456sz/why_is_stephen_hawking_alive_if_asl_a_disease_he/).
$C: Nooooo! This is so sad
$C: We all knew it could happen at any time, but damn, that‚Äôs sad. 
$C: Wow, time takes us all I suppose.
$C: He was an incredible scientist. But let's not also forget how he fought tirelessly for social and economic justice over his time on this earth too. He will sorely be missed.
$C: I‚Äôm up voting this for visibility, but downvoting this in my head. Huge loss. No idea how he lived as long as he did, but we were fortunate enough to live during his time.
$C: Oh no... that's the first new of the day. And not a good one. Here is a good quote :

"I believe alien life is quite  common in the universe, although intelligent life is less so. Some say it has yet to appear on planet Earth."
$C: Gone but not forgotten.

Seriously, I take solace in the fact that we as a human collective will not forget the man who taught us so much while physically capable of so little.

If a heaven does exist, Dr. Hawking, you‚Äôre there walking around right now.
$C: This would be a real shame, if it wasn't for a fact that he was a hack. The chair did all the talking and just used this deflated Lou Gehrig. And it makes sense that someone like him wouldn't believe in God or the afterlife. I mean the bible only shows disabilities as a direct cause of sin. If I was so shitty of a person that I became a fucking sockpuppet I would probably also deny an all loving God. 
$C: jesus christ i cant believe he is dead, he is my idol.
$C: He had a great life, especially for the circumstances he was in. Seemed like a good dude.
$C: Damn. This is one of the hardest hitting deaths for me. Having seen him often around Cambridge during my life, he is one of those people my brain assumed would be around forever. 
$C: That makes me sad. He has contributed so much to human knowledge. Rest in Peace Professor Hawking.
$C: He roamed the cosmos from a wheelchair, Rest In Peace Mr.Hawking 
$C: Damn this loss is actually tragic. This man is a legend and legends never die. 
$C: I hope his discoveries can continue to expand our knowledge and exploration of the universe. RIP Dr. Hawking. 
$C: He lead a tough life but man, what a genius. 
$C: Another shining beacon of humanity is gone.

But I feel his light will shine for a long time.
$C: I am deeply hurt by this news. 
$C: Goodnight, sweet prince
$C: A great man.  Perhaps one of the greatest minds we've ever known.  We will miss you and your humor.  Thank you for opening so many other minds to the impossibilities that can become possible if someone puts their mind to it. 
$C: One of the most remarkable people in all of history, and one to be truly revered. RIP Mr. Hawking.
$C: Damn, not what I was hoping to see giving reddit one last look before bed.  RIP, truly one of the greatest scientists the world has ever known.
$C: He had ALS and yet actually *exceeded* life expectancy (at birth). That's fucking crazy.
$C: Godspeed, Mr. Hawking.
$C: Cool guy, not the most chatty. met him once. Did not realise he was so old. 
$C: This man was incredibly influential and he truly was a genius. Stephen will live on forever through his genius works and his countless achievements in astrophysics. Rest In Peace, go be with the stars. 
$C: Wow that did shock me as I didn't meant to see this.
$C: Check out his recent appearance on Star Talk with Neal deGrasse Tyson. He had some heavy duty answers about our universe.

A great one is gone.
$C: We just became significantly dumber as a species
$C: Nnnnnnnoooooooooooooooooo!!!!! Noooooo!!!!!!! 

What theoretical physicist do I follow now? He was a genius.
$C: Hope he is more comfortable and free now,
RIP brother.
$C: He was an inspiration to millions. RIP
$C: Humanity has lost an amazing being, rest in peace
$C: This is the first celebrity death that actually makes me want to cry a little
$C: Rest in peace to a beloved member of the scientific community and the world in general. <3
$C: Oh man. I thought 2017 ended a few months ago 
$C: rest in peace my good sir
$C: He lived an amazing life, and history will remember as one of the greats. Right up there with Einstein, Tesla, Newton, and so on. Do not go gently into that good night. We will miss you.
$C: Thanks for all your insight, knowledge and general influence, Mr. Hawking
$C: He‚Äôs now trying to catch up to Elon‚Äôs Tesla, right?
$C: He was such a forward thinker. Such a terrible loss
$C: Wow rest in peace Stephen Hawking. Your brilliance will not be forgotten but you will be sorely missed.
$C: Bloody hell, we just lost a remarkable man. 
$C: Hari Seldon of our time passed away. 
$C: Rest in peace Stephen Hawking, thank you for all your contributions to science. 
$C: F, to the end of the universe
$C: I'll always remember reading The Universe in a Nutshell for the first time... I'm going to give it another read.
$C: If he is being cremated it would be awesome to shoot his remains and a copies of all his bodies of work into a black hole [elon musk] in the hopes whatever is on the other side gets all of it :D
$C: RIP to a brilliant soul
$C: Thank you for all the interest you sparked in our minds for science. You will be truly missed.
$C: Man, the world just lost a connection to the stars. Very tragic news.
$C: Had the honour to meet this blessed man last fall. He was so full of wisdom and joy and this comes as such a shock to me. This is one of those headlines I will not fully take onboard for at least a week. RIP.
$C: just found out from twitch chat.

sad day
$C: I saw this on BBC and was so heartbroken. Rest In Peace. 
$C: I really wish I hadn't checked Reddit one last time before bed. Despite his age and health, I'm genuinely shocked. 
$C: This is deeply saddens me, like many on here I never knew him as a person but always admired his incredible achivements despite his disability, may he rest in peace.
$C: Truly a sad day for science and progressive thought. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anyone alive today to fill the vacuum he leaves. 
$C: I can't believe this. He is the brightest light in a world of morons. He dragged society forward with him. 
$C: A Brief history of time changed my life. 
$C: Time to watch The Theory of Everything again. That's so sad to hear
$C: What an amazing man. Rest in peace 
$C: Damn caught me off guard. Rest easy my friend. 
$C: I just hope we don't take his teachings to vein. This man had many far out there yet brilliant ideas. I hope that he wasn't too far ahead of his time. That's up to us. 
$C: "My expectations were reduced to zero when I was 21. Everything since then has been a bonus." - Stephen Hawking

A true inspiration not just for his brilliance but how he faced the adversity of his illness and handicap.  This never stopped him from pushing his limits and having some fun too. Thank you for sharing your thoughts, knowledge and life with us on this tiny blue planet.
$C: Damn, the world just lost one of the most incredible minds to have ever existed. :( Rip sir.
$C: This man has profoundly impacted myself, the science community, and the world at large. 

I've never been one to get overly sensitive to the passing of icons. However, this one stings.

RIP Dr. Hawking. You will be missed. 
$C: He‚Äôs not supposed to live this due to his ALS. But he kept on playing Heisenberg‚Äôs principle with life! RIP. 
$C: I hope aliens took him and this is just the story us dummies down on Earth are stuck with. Either way, it makes it all feel just a but lonelier; we desperately need all the thinkers we have right now and we've lost a great one.
$C: Unreal. The fact that he loved this long with his disease is nothing short of a miracle but I was not expecting this. What a great man, he will be missed greatly
$C: Rest In Peace Stephen Hawking. You will never be forgotten. üò≠
$C: Serious question. Will his "voice" live on?
$C: Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto
$C: I finished reading an article about Tillerson‚Äôs departure on NPR, clicked back, refreshed the app and discovered this tragic news.

Edit: apostrophe 
$C: I can't believe it. There are some people whom you just cannot imagine of hearing this news about. RIP...
$C: May he rest, where ever that may be,  knowing that he will never be forgotten 
$C: He survived his projected age of death by 54 years. Lucky for us all.
$C: He's done so much in his work for all of us despite his ailments. We are so much closer to understanding the universe because of him, and I look forward to somebody standing on the shoulders of this giant and seeing more. It's what he would have wanted.

Rest In Peace Stephen
$C: [He's with Carl now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgiXGELjbc)
$C: i dont see what the big deal is about the stephen guy
$C: He may yet manage to be the most influential person in the last century, depending on how some of his more theoretical contributions to science end up impacting the world.

We lost a damn providence today. RIP Mr. Hawking.
$C: There goes one of the greats. Rest in peace Stephen.
$C: I like to think he just slid his consciousness into another dimension.
Rest in power.
$C: We have just lost an entire universe of intelligence and knowledge.

He will not be replaced.
$C: Today, humanity lost one of it's greatest minds.  RIP, Stephen Hawking.
$C: Heart wrenching, didn't see this coming. RIP 
$C: I'm not sure I could even muster the fortitude to be positive, let alone be as driven, and such an inspiration. You are truly cosmic!
$C: i like physics, but i love cartoons-stephen hawking(futurama)
$C: He outlived so many people. Cheers to Hawking, sailing among the stars.
$C: ‚ÄúI have noticed even people who claim everything is predestined, and that we can do nothing to change it, look before they cross the road‚Äù. Thank you, #RIP
$C: Damn.. I really don't have any real words for this.. I mean, with his age and his condition, part of me always knew this was coming sooner rather than later, but it doesn't make it easier to see such a great man go.

May history remember him for centuries along side the other great men of science
$C: What an amazing man. Rest in Peace. Can't believe it.
$C: RIP. you will be missed
$C: RIP to one of the Most Brilliant Minds in History!

Press F to pay respects.
$C: This is horrible.

Rest in peace Mr. Hawking
$C: We lost a legend today RIP
$C: What a bummer. Dude was quite inspirational. Universe just got a bit dimmer
$C: It's crazy, I just read an article the other day over how he has survived so long with ALS. I swear I just saw it less than a week ago. 
$C: Elon should launch Stephen Hawking‚Äôs wheelchair into space
$C: We lost a great mind today, RIP
$C: Press f to pay respect
$C: Rest in peace you amazing human being. He was amazing and the world is a worse place without him. 
$C: He lived for a long time even with his condition, what he accomplished in that time is even more incredible.
$C: Rest in peace Mr. Hawking, thank you for everything
$C: Now we only got black science man
$C: What an Amazing mind! A real loss to the whole world. 
$C: Such an inspiration, RIP Stephen 
$C: Rest in peace to the smartest man of our time. 

His existence was beautiful; i dont think anyone expected him to live as long as he did.
$C: This really caught me off guard. Rest in peace.
$C: Major loss to science and the world.
$C: One of the greatest minds  to have ever lived.
$C: What...this is not how I envision to start the day...
$C: The amount this man could have accomplished if it weren't for that fucker ALS 
$C: My reaction when I heard was literally "no, no, no, no"... 
$C: Damn. I audibly whispered out "whaaaat" in disbelief. He's part of the reason for my interest in quantum physics and space, and that probably goes for a lot of people.

You'll be missed, homie.
$C: It's an end of an era. RIP
$C: Thank you for everything Prof. Hawking. The world has lost a true visionary tonight
$C: Holy shit, a legend in the field of science just gone.
$C: Wow. This absolutely shocked me and I don't even know why. 
$C: Dr. Hawking is the successor to Albert einstein; he has been the greatest physicist for the past 50 years, despite all of his illnesses and disabilities.

I would like to say thank you for his works in physics and sciences. RIP Dr. Hawking.
$C: Thank you sir. Few people have ever been able to  truly affect the weekend by influencing so many people, a generation or two even 
$C: Fifty five years of living with ALS. damn. 
$C: Wow, this was so sudden. A shame such a genius had to go. Rest in peace Stephen Hawking.
$C: The knowledge that is lost with him is sad to think about.  RIP sir. 
$C: RIP to one of the most inspiring human ever to be a part of our existence.
$C: Fuck... it was inevitable but still surprising and sad.
$C: Thank you for your contributions to Science & Humanity! 
$C: Just realized that due to the the time zones, he died on Wednesday. 3/14 Pi Day.

It feels somehow appropriate. Still sad, but a bit more poetic. 
$C: Stephen Hawking died on Pi day: 3.14
$C: Sucks. With all the other bullshit going on in the world, losing an icon like this makes the world marginally worse still.
$C: What an inspiration to us all, RIP sir Steven hawking.
$C: Wow, this is truly shocking for me and I don't really know why. 
$C: The theory of everything
$C: He was one of the most inspirational men in the field of science. Rest in peace.
$C: Holy cow, 76? With his disease, it was a miracle he lived that long. 
$C: We would know what his last words were, but he died mid sentence
$C: He made it to 76 with ALS. What a fucking trooper. The void he's left will be hard to fill.
$C: My heart sank when I read this. 
$C: He was an amazing man, and I feel that his presence is going to be felt for a very long time.
$C: His brain was a creative computer :(
$C: I‚Äôd say heaven got a bit smarter, but he‚Äôs an atheist.  Hope he‚Äôs been proven wrong.
$C: When I saw this headline my heart literally sank, like I was dropped down a rollercoaster, if true, this is an absolute loss for humanity.  =(
$C: You will be missed Mr. Hawkings. F
$C: Man this hit me like a brick. Even if I didn't keep up with what he did, I'm going to miss him.
$C: It's really weird, I never thought about the possibility of him dying until now.
$C: Sheldon is gonna be heartbroken.
$C: I didn‚Äôt realize he was that old, especially with his illness. Impressive he made it this far and accomplished all he did though. 
$C: Thank you for everything. Rest In Peace.
$C: God damn it! Fuck 2018
$C: Thank you for everything.
$C: To think one of the last things he probably heard was "Space Force"
$C: Wow... I‚Äôm definitely going to miss him.
$C: What a brilliant man. I‚Äôm so shocked and saddened by this :(
$C: Wait, I thought this was a hoax.  Is he really gone?
$C: I hope his last moments were spent with a winking time traveler.
$C: He is responsible for most of our modern understanding of the universe. A great man died today, and during a time when we need minds like him the most. He will be sorely missed.
$C: My phone sent me a notification when Kylie Jenner had her baby but didn‚Äôt send me anything when Steven Hawking died.


$C: Despite the awful setbacks in life I would argue Stephen Hawking had the most fulfilling life anyone has ever had. The things he accomplished both in professionally and personally are what we all strive to have. And he has influenced not only today's crop of scientists but many more for generations to come.

All the while being unable to move or speak (naturally). Truly a remarkable human being.

RIP
$C: ALS sucks. Donate so they can find a cure :(
$C: Rest in Piece, Doctor Hawking. 
$C: I grew up watching him on discovery channel and reading his books. He truly was an inspiration to me. 
$C: God don't know why this cuts me so deep. First "celeb" death that is hitting me hard. I respected this man so much. I hope this kind of genius has not become extinct. 
$C: Devastating. One of the best minds the world has ever seen has left us and it will never be the same. RIP Stephen.
$C: This world just lost more than a person, more than a legend!  "I have noticed even people who claim everything is predestined, and that we can do nothing to change it, look before they cross the road."
$C: Such a loss for humanity. We were blessed to have someone who cared so deeply for the advancement of mankind.  RIP 
$C: RIP to one of the greatest men in history
F
$C: I'm so happy that he had a movie about his life made before he passed. Most of the great men and women are often honor posthumously. 
$C: Farewell then, Professor Stephen Hawking

Though your Time was relatively Brief

History will not forget you.
$C: An icon for perseverance. 

His story is one of legend, and the world won't forget his impact.

Rest in piece. 
$C: The world has lost one of its most brilliant minds. RIP Mr. Hawking.
$C: I call the world without Stephen a Hawking Hole.
$C: One of those people you feel like they are never going to die. And a good person as well. Those rarely go together.
$C: Damn, I was just reading about his life the other day. It's amazing he's lived this long in the condition he was in but his death is still surprising.
$C: One of the best representatives of man kind and what we're capable of has left us, godspeed Mr.Hawking.
$C: Noooo! We have lost a great mind today
$C: This fucking sucks. RIP.
$C: God this news really made me feel so down. I knew it was gonna happen eventually but I was not ready for this. RIP to the smartest man in the world.
$C: Changed the way our world thinks. Truly impressive. Never underestimate anyone. Rest In Peace Mr. Hawking. 
$C: A great loss for the planet. Thanks for all you gave us. Rest easy Dr. 
$C: RIP Mr. Hawking. You will be missed
$C: He is an inspiration to everyone with how much he accomplished despite his handicap. Rest in peace Mr. Hawking, and thank you.
$C: Rest in peace. The man accomplished so much and inspired so many. 
$C: I can't help but feel we missed out on so much knowledge. He knew so much and yet it was all trapped within a mind that struggled to express it. Imagine what he would have been capable of had he not had such restraints, especially considering what he accomplished in spite of them.
$C: Bro wtf this man was a legend
$C: He was the great scientist..
$C: Oh no! I hope there are a lot of his works still unpublished and in progress so other students and like minded geniuses can take it up and continue working on it.
$C: Rest in peace, Mr. Hawking. You, and your work will be sorely missed.
$C: RIP Mr Hawking's may you find warmth in your event Horizon. He was put into a black hole by ALS but rose above and burned like a phoenix.
$C: My grandfather gave me his copy of "A Brief History of Time" when I was a kid. Stephen Hawking had been one of his role models and inspired most of his hobbies and personal interests. It took me years to finally be able to understand the book since I was so young, but if it hadn't been for that I wouldn't have chosen a career in astronomy. Hawking truly helped shape my life. 
I'll go see my grandfather tomorrow to tell him the news. He's 90 now - to outlive one of your role models is a shocking thing. 
$C: Fucking bummed. Hawking was not only one of the greatest minds of all time, he was also a prominent atheist. He defied all the odds and lived a long productive life. RIP my fellow atheist.
$C: A huge inspiration for me and a big reason why I took such an interest in science. RIP
$C: Damn I wonder how the big bang theory will react to this. Sheldons probably gonna go into comatose
$C: May you rest in peace you beautiful fucking scholar 
$C: *"For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals*

*Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination*

*We learned to talk"*

[Pink Floyd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJ7zbzJZsjs)- keep talking. feat Mr. Hawking.


$C: With how succesful he had been at battling death throughout most of his life, you'd kinda expect he'd eventually find a way to defeat it once and for all. 

In a way, I guess he did. He is no doubt going to be immortalized by history as one of the most important humans ever, both by science and by popular culture.
$C: Rest in peace, Mr. Hawking. 
$C: Born on the anniversary of Galileo‚Äôs death
Died on the anniversary of Einstein‚Äôs birth
$C: Hawking and Einstein can now do science battles in heaven as portrayed in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zn7-fVtT16k
$C: this man was one of the most influential scientists/ physicists of all time and achieved this from a wheel chair with a life threatening condition.... i‚Äôm happy if i can balance the weekly budget. RIP legend.
$C: For sure, a hero of our planet. His imagination really did span the cosmos. I loved his into the universe show and Universe in a Nutshell.
$C: Well damn... the world is a little less special today. A rare case where one can say there will never be someone like him again, and probably be correct.
$C: How long before Russia is blamed?
$C: He's not dead, he's finally off exploring the cosmos, rest in peace Mr Hawking
$C: RIP Stephen Hawking. You inspired countless people.
$C: Every word that he wrote was so well thought out. He took a weakness and turned it into one of his greatest strengths! An inspiration for generations to come! 
$C: Perhaps now would be a good time to remember [his warning](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3nyn5i/science_ama_series_stephen_hawking_ama_answers/cvsdmkv/) to us.
$C: When I read the title, something Dark Tower run across my mind - no big deal but then I realize it is Stephen HAWKING and I thought 

SHIT.

I think my brain tried real hard to resist the idea that Dr Hawking died... Rest in peace.
$C: I never took up science. Never got into it.

Yet this still hit me hard. That's how great this man was.
$C: Holy shit. Was not expecting this around this time. 
$C: A great loss to humanity, but I am very thankful for his contributions to science and culture. His brilliance was only outshined by his altruim and levity, despite his own (and humanities) condition. Thank you Mr Hawking. 
$C: One of the best Scientist around. May he rest in peace
$C: I don‚Äôt usually care much about celebrity deaths. 

But this one. This one hurts. 

You will be missed, Stephen. 
$C: He is my brilliant, promising TV star. RIP
$C: This will be the top most upvoted reddit thread of all time by morning.
$C: Did they download his consciousness or freeze his body or anything similar to that effect? I think somewhere I read he had something planned but I'm not sure
$C: He's probably just left us to explore dark matter and black holes. Earth was clearly holding him back.
$C: It really is amazing how long he was able to live with his condition and all the contributions he has made with his time. Rest In Peace to one of the smartest people of our time.
$C: Didn't expect to read something like this at midnight, holy hell.
$C: I guess one of his time travel parties finally got out of hand...
$C: This is terrible news. However, I'm happy Hawkings was able to live up to 76 years. What he achieved and contributed to human knowledge is incredible. His ideas will live on. 
$C: The fact that he outlived speculation that he was to die young, and lived a life in opening people's minds to his brilliance, is something to remember. RIP
$C: This is genuinely saddening. I had kind of assumed that Stephen Hawking would just keep on living. 
$C: This is a real bummer. I don‚Äôt get bummed out by deaths too much, but this sucks. RIP, if there is an afterlife.
$C: Awe jeez..... RIP homie
$C: Common he just transferred his mind into a suitable body.  
$C: My mom had ALS, and it devastated my family to watch her go through it and have no hope to survive. Watching Stephen Hawking live for SO long with that terminal illness made me feel a little vindicated. He helped inspire my love for Astronomy greatly, and I thank the Cosmos that we got to know such a great man.
$C: As sad as it is, he did it. He accomplished life beyond terminal illness. He inspired hundreds of thousands of lives and the will never be forgotten. His legacy will love on forever. 
$C: Press F to pay respects
$C: OMG . What a tragedy. I wish there was a way to know what he knew and everything that he was working on.   R.I.P. The Great Stephen Hawking 
$C: Wow, that caught me off guard.

R.I.P.
$C: RIP Dr Hawking, you will not be forgotten. Your legacy will live on in all those you have inspired.
$C: Terrible, this is the first "celebrity" death that has really hit me in a long time, he was a childhood hero of mine.

I think we should all take solace in the fact that he lived such a long life, in spite of his illness. He was diagnosed with ALS at 21 and the average lifespan after a ALS diagnosis is only two to five years.
$C: Well if aliens attack we now have zero hope. 
$C: [Boom de yada.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVP4l2dSyYw&feature=youtu.be&t=52)

RIP Mr. Hawking, thank you for your contribution. 
$C: On the list of people I thought I would see pass, Stephen Hawking wasn't one of them. I always imagined him outliving us off and sharing with us his deep knowledge and theories. 
$C: It's honestly incredible that he was able to make it to 76, considering he was diagnosed with his disease at age 21. I had no idea it started so early for him.
$C: No...  Noooooo!  Noooooo too!  Noooooo three!  
$C: [CNN just released their bit on his passing.](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/14/health/stephen-hawking-dead/index.html) He was one of the great voices of our time, and I can only imagine the young (and old!) minds he‚Äôs helped think in a different way, develop an idea and figure out the *what if?* 
Rest In Peace Mr. Hawking. Humanity is thankful for your service. 
$C: Rest in peace humanity
$C: It's news like this that make you appreciate just   how important he was, not just as a scientist but as a figurehead, an incredible mind that absolutely transcended science and was truly a household name .

When he spoke the world listened.
$C: RIP you absolute legend.
$C: We are lucky to have shared the same air as this brilliant person. Rip
$C: "We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special." - Stephen Hawking
Thank you, Professor Hawking
$C: At least now he'll be able to walk and talk again. R.I.P. 
$C: RIP...he is among the stars now
$C: God this is so hard to hear. He's what drove me to love space ever since I was a kid. I hope I can be half the man he was
$C: He wasn't ashamed of himself or his disease and he never stopped working hard to try and understand the universe. RIP
$C: Hearing Dr. Hawking pass on the first day of university is saddening yet inspiring.
$C: Wow unbelievable May he rest in piece my dudes
$C: He was one of those inspiring figures in my life ever since I read 'A Brief History of Time'. A brilliant mind, and a great sense of humour as well. The world will miss you!
$C: For some reason, all i could think of while reading this, was that one episode of Epic Rap Battles of History
$C: As a tribute, listening to Pink Floyd's Keep talking on repeat today. Stephen Hawking in the song- "For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals. Then something happenend which unleashed the power of our imagination: We learned to talk"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJ7zbzJZsjs
$C: We've been through some crushing celebrity deaths in the past few years, but this is the first one where I screamed "NO!" as soon as I saw the headline, and had to apologize to my roommates. I haven't felt this way since 2012 when Neil Armstrong died. 

Rest in Peace Sir Hawking. Thank you for your life's work, for helping to spark many kids' interest in physics (including mine) and for showing people around the world that physical disability can be transcended. 
$C: Aw fuck man. Rest in peace Mr Hawking. You can run with stars now. Thank you for everything. 
$C: He will live on as one of the greatest minds ever. Rest in peace.
$C: I'm just so bummed right now.
$C: Mad, not at him for dying. Mad because this world poorer without him. Rest in peace sweet prince. May you run through the fields of gold
$C: Science dimmed just a little today. Go amongst the stars.
$C: Crazy how he wasn‚Äôt supposed to live past 2 years after being diagnosed with ALS, yet he lived to 76, RIP Steven Hawking 
$C: On average, the people of the world just got a little bit stupider.
$C: Good run. He survived his original diagnosis by 40 years.
$C: Think i will miss his humour most of all.
$C: Rest in peace, Mr. Hawking. Your contributions to humankind will be written in the stars.
$C: A great man who shaped many lives, I feel like I owe so much of my passion of science to him. He gave some much passion and effort to shared his gifts with the world. Thanks so much for all you‚Äôve done Stephen, you‚Äôll be missed dearly.
$C: Genuinely heart-breaking. This planet can not afford to lose the wonderfully gifted beings that Hawking was, and he will be dearly missed. 
$C: here i am drinking a beer before sleep, and history happens out of nowhere
$C: History won't forget this man. He is now along side Newton and Einstein with history's greats.
$C: The universe was a little better having him be a part of it.
$C: The world‚Äôs average IQ dropped several points today.
$C: No, no, no, 2018, you are *not* going to pull that 2016 shit on us again.
$C: Holy shit, I honestly don't know what to think about this, I really never even thought about this happening
$C:  This saddens me. The world of physics has suffered one of its greatest losses today. May he return to the stars from whence his atoms came from. 
$C: 2018 is off to a great start.  Gawd dammit this is heart-breaking.
$C: One of the smartest minds of this world had to offer. Rest In peace
$C: May his legacy continue 
$C: Rest In Peace Dr Hawking. You now know the truth you‚Äôve been pondering all your life. 

Hope you will get to meet Einstein, Gauss, Schrodinger, Tesla, Newton, and other great scientists up there. 

You‚Äôre  a unique person; benefited and hindered by biological functions. I remember in my very easily teens less that 9 years ago, I‚Äôm now 19, that I used to watch on the science channel thinking about God and space along with Theough the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman. Talking through the computer simply amazes me; I envisioned your mind as truly enlightened in theoretical physics. 

As a young undergrad science and engineering major, people like me will miss you dearly, being an iconic part of that inspiration in television science in the early 21st century, constantly pondering & pursuing science despite your condition. 
$C: Apparently he died on Pi Day? Not a bad day for a physicist to go, if ever there was one.

R.I.P., Mr. Hawking!
$C: Try turning him off and on again? ^^^too^^^soon?
$C: Jesus, it‚Äôs one of those deaths that always seems like is gonna happen, but you don‚Äôt even really think about it or acknowledge it because it just seems unacknowledgeable

Rip buddy
$C: Rest in peace to the fellow who has inspired so many.
$C: I legitimately can't believe what I just read. It can't be real. I know it's terribly real and I'm so sorry to his family but...I'm in shock. Thank God the movie about his life has already happened, because I think it deserves to be immortalized.
$C: Wow. I instantly had to do a double take when the news notification came in. This hit me off guard. 
$C: I attribute a lot of my love for space because of this man. I truly hope he Rests In Peace.
$C: I'm debating whether I should upvote or not becuase this was clearly posted for karma. 

On a serious note though, rest in peace Stephen Hawking. Your work will not be forgotten
$C: >"Life would be tragic if it weren't funny."

[Still one the best Simpson's episodes ever.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH8s4N15zdg)

RIP Mr. Hawking
$C: Although I was sort of ready with this kind of news about him, I'm still surprised. His invaluable contribution to science will live forever. 
$C: I have no words. Simply one of mankind‚Äôs greatest geniuses. 
RIP

$C: So sad... this is the last thing I expected to see on my news feed üíî RIP Stephen, you were an inspiration to so many, and will be missed dearly. 
$C: One of the greatest people to live in our time. May he rest in peace. 
$C: Wow, RIP to an amazing man that contributed a huge amount to what we know about science today. He will be missed.
$C: At least it might be a relief for him after all these years :'(

$C: RIP, Stephen Hawking. Here‚Äôs a good summary of his achievements: [Stephen Hawking key discoveries](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/5189411/Stephen-Hawkings-key-discoveries.html) 
$C: Such a amazing mind! Factor in the fact the doctors gave him two years to live and he went on to live a good 50 years more being a medical miracle in doing that and you had one hell of a human being! 
But like somebody said it's really weird the possibility of him dying at any time never registered with me.
$C: This really made me sadder then I thought I would. I don't think I've even processed it yet.
$C: Oh my gosh. I just kind of felt like he would be around forever as silly as that is. üò≠
$C: A great mind who once looked to the stars, now shall join them. Rest In Peace, you incredible man. 
$C: [Researchers catch supermassive black hole burping‚Äîtwice](https://phys.org/news/2018-01-supermassive-black-hole-burpingtwice.html) Maybe it was Stephen from another dimension trying to come to this one!
$C: Awww, man. This one hurts. üò¢ RIP and soar, Mr. Hawking.
$C: He and Carl Sagan are the ones that made me love physics. This really hurts. He was my hero.
$C: Most badass genius imo. When a debilitating disease hit him, he said fuck you and kept doing what he loved. RIP
$C: I feel unsurprised and completely caught off guard at the same time. 
$C: Most remembered for being the man behind the voice of Star Wars' "R2D2".
$C: Somebody check on Jim Parsons
$C: Alas, he was with us for only A Brief History of Time. You will be greatly missed Dr. Hawking.
$C: Whether you have faith or not, being free from the confinement of his body can be viewed as a positive thing, despite the profound loss for humanity this is. Even small quotes from this man have changed the view of the universe for hundreds of millions of people.
$C: I‚Äôm shocked. I accidentally hit the front page trying to go on another sub and see this... 
I wasn‚Äôt prepared to read this. If anything, he lived a well and enjoyable life. I know the future will remember him, and I‚Äôm glad he will be. 
$C: He led the sort of life that forces me to put mine into perspective, to think of how he took on the disadvantages thrown at him and put his brilliant mind to the best possible use. I might be able to walk and talk, but I with Stephen Hawking I always felt that I was the one with the handicap compared to his genius. And yet he still managed to come across as warm and genuine even with that distinct robotic voice.
$C: I just walked in from work. What an awful fucking way to end the day. Rest peacefully, sir, and thank you for everything you ever taught me about science, life, and perseverance.  
$C: Awww man. What a legend. I hope he had some more knowlege stashed away to pass on. We can never move forward without minds like his.
$C: Rest in peace Mr. Hawking. Thank you for your contributions to science and humanity.
$C: Thank you for your brilliance and ideas.

The world would be a better place if we made people such as yourself celebrities than Paris Hilton
$C: I like to imagine that he is now having so much fun discovering new things about the cosmos from the other side.
$C: The only person to star as themselves on an episode of Star Trek. R.I.P
$C: Damn, I was just listened to Star Talk with him making an appearance  i believe was NYC2017 comic con.  I have to search for it on my podcast. He lived a long life with his illness.  RIP
$C: Fuck i thought this was a joke, what a loss
$C: Stephen Hawking left such an impact on the world and its heart breaking that he had to go so soon. I wrote up A eulogy in memorial

Stephen's mind was like space as it was ever expanding.
With new theories being thought up like galaxies being born .
His concepts were like a sun with other bright minds principles revolving around it.
Those brilliant conjectures however were sometimes eclipsed behind the moon of the physical world .
His mind may have been trapped in what seemed to be a black hole but knowledge doesn‚Äôt follow the laws of physics.
He may be gone now but his meteor of discovery has left an impact on the world .
Like the Universe, He started life with a bang and is ending life in a hole.
Stephen Hawking was truly out of this world .

$C: "If human life were long enough to find the ultimate theory, everything would have been solved by previous generations. Nothing would be left to be discovered."

- Stephen Hawking. Rest in peace. 
$C: Rest in peace, and fly high through the universe.
$C: :( its a shame, the world needs more scientists. Of coirse death is inevitable but its especially sureal when its an icon like him. Rest in peace 
$C: The world just lost such a hugely influential giant. Rest In Peace. 
$C: I will speak in his tongue to remember him in my heart.‚ù§Ô∏è 
$C: > Not only does God play dice, but... he sometimes throws them where they cannot be seen.

R.I.P. Stephen Hawking, you will be sorely missed by the scientific community.
$C: Wow. An incredible life though. Defied the odds and defined an era of enlightenment and knowledge. Man truly made the absolute most of his life, given the circumstance. He‚Äôll be remembered as he lived, an icon of science.
$C: What did he say or do in the hours before his death? or during his last conscious moments?
$C: He lived a fruitful life, and is tremendously fortunate for living as long as he did.  This is one of those deaths that makes me really sad, but it's odd because there's something wholesome about it.  I know I'm not describing this feeling right...
$C: It was truly a blessing to have this man help advance our understanding the universe, and one that we should never take lightly.  This man surpassed almost all odds and lived well beyond his predicted lifetime after he was diagnosed with his disease.  He did what he loved until the end, and he was with those he truly loved and cared for.  A proper end to a fantastic human being.  He will be missed in both the scientific community and the world for years to come, but his achievements will forever impact and inspire us to achieve greatness and will leave a legacy that will last multiple lifetimes. I hope that we can honor his legacy by never giving up the quest of discovering ways to better our understanding of the universe.  RIP.
$C: Huge inspiration, he‚Äôll be remembered for centuries.
$C: RIP. Sic Itur Ad Astra - ‚Äúthus one goes to the stars‚Äù. 
$C: As a university student furiously studying for finals, I thank you Mr. Hawking for your contributions to science.  
Godspeed.  
$C: He was a true inspiration that brought science to the public eye with his work on black holes. He was an amazing human and my condolences go out to his family :(
$C: This man is the definition of anyone can do it attitude. Couldn‚Äôt move and still was the most influential man of recent times. Let his legacy be an inspiration!
$C: Was scrolling through Reddit and saw this news on page 2. Thought it had to be a hoax, little did I know I just caught it really early. 
$C: He should've grabbed shotgun in Elon's roadster. Godspeed. 
$C: No no no why? What the hell. Why is this affecting me soo much...
$C: The extraordinary man and mind Stephen Hawking was can not fully be expressed but the caption of the bottom photo gives insight into his presence in this world. 

>Pope Francis was one of those who met Stephen Hawking

Godspeed
$C: Wow. Even though he was a scientist, dealing in the real, watching his show as a kid really fueled my imagination. 

I also grew up with his series of "George's Key to the Universe" books. Loved the hell outta them.
$C: First celebrity death that has ever made me cry. RIP Prof. Hawking.
$C: He was such a gift to the world, 
which makes it really hard to imagine a world without him. 
$C: I‚Äôm genuinely shocked! How awful. He was such an inspiration to even little old me in Melbourne Australia. What an utter genius the world has lost. How will we go on? This is terrible. Oh god I‚Äôm rambling. As a geek, I found his brilliance to be such a wonderful thing to see in spite of his disability. Dear Lordy I‚Äôm so glad, though, that there are many more brilliant scientists to follow him, inspired by him, to carry on his work. Long live the king!
$C: NOOOOO I thought he was immortal. Such a loss for humanity. R.I.P. 
$C: The guy didn't even look 76. Not saying this to be insensitive, but I wonder if not being able to move your face for this long reduces wrinkles forming.
$C: Fuck...... You will be missed Mr. Hawking
$C: The memes will never die. Rest in peace Mr. Hawking.


...but we're still gonna make AI sex toys. 
$C: I just saw this and immediately thought. 

Awwwww fuuuuuckkkk. 

Then said it aloud. 

God damnit man that's just sad.
$C: I for one thought stephen Hawking is celebrated because he was a handicap. But then one day i read about his contributions to science, that motivated me to read his books, He was genius at such a scale that i cant begin to comprehend. One of the greatest and brightest minds of our time. Rest in Peace sir. The world owes you a lot. 
$C: Time is such a precious thing, still.

I wonder how future generations will look at him.
$C: He never got to see AI take over.
$C: Rest in peace Mister Hawking

Thank you for all your achievements. You and your achievements won‚Äòt be forgotten (at least as far as we understand them). Enjoy the ride amongst the stars
$C: Talk about a punch in the gut, damn
$C: The man is a legend, he really showed that disabilities don't define who you are. Rest well Stephen, you will be missed. 
$C: Do we know why yet?
$C: The man faced the challenges head on and lived a full life enriching us with his wisdom all along.

RIP, a true inspiration .
$C: Wow.. This was... Really unexpected.. Like... Wow
$C: No, this can't be happening! 

Maybe he just needs a hard reset or disk defrag? 
$C: I wonder if there will be any cheeky time travellers at his funeral.

RIP to a brilliant mind. 
$C: The world has lost an amazing person.
$C: Today just felt really really weird and now....just....wow, talk about beating the odds.  I think I'm still in shock....
$C: Seeing someone this familiar pass really puts things in perspective doesn‚Äôt it? I wonder what he will be remembered for decades from now
$C: Died one day before pi day 
$C: RIP to one of the GOATs
$C: he actually passed away a few months ago.

he's right now sitting in a car in space headed to mars
$C: Really shitty news from areally shitty username :(
$C: Wow, out of all the possible headlines that I could have read, I didn't expect this one to hit me as hard as it did.
$C: Send him to the stars.
$C: Kinda expected him to just sorta live forever for some reason, huh

RIP, glad he was able to accomplish as much as he did in the circumstances he was delt with
$C: Wow, holy fuck. That's a major loss for the physics community. Hope that we can have someone to pick up the torch for our next steps in the field soon.
$C: > ‚ÄúThere is probably no heaven, and no afterlife either,‚Äù Hawking said. ‚ÄúWe have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that, I am extremely grateful.‚Äù

Just another quote for people to observe. Rest in peace starboy
$C: One of my favorite apropos jokes:

What happens when Stephen hawking dies?

The windows shutdown sound plays.

Rest in peace, Mr. Hawking.
$C: Holy shit. Well this came out of nowhere.
$C: ‚ÄúWhat is it that breathes fire into the equations, and makes a universe for them to describe?‚Äù
$C: He did everything he could. Much more then I would have thought anyone person capable of. 

He has been the most inspiring person most youth imagine. 
We can never hope to fill his shoes, but we all have a responsibility to try.
$C: >Hawking was born on Jan. 8, 1942 ‚Äï the 300th anniversary of Galileo‚Äôs death ‚Äï in Oxford, England

Reincarnation after 300 years confirmed. Early adopters may experience mixed results.
$C: Oh, I actually felt my face droop upon reading this headline.

A wonderful mind and incredible perseverence, it will be strange living in a post-Hawking world.
$C: I hate when someone tells you someone important died and you don't believe them.  Then you find this.
$C: When a guy overcomes ALS for as long as he did, you forget he isn't immortal. RIP.
$C: We've just lost the Gordon Freeman of our universe.

We are so fucked, it was nice knowing you all.
$C: I feel like there's not much to add because everyone else has already said everything, but Rest In Peace Stephen Hawking. You were an incredible man and the world is better off for your contributions. 
$C: This is the sort of loss that humanity simply can't replace. Thankfully we'll always have the knowledge he passed on but still his contributions moving forward will be sorely missed. 

Terribly sad news, especially following everything SpaceX has been accomplishing and how many more people over the recent years have gained an interest in science because of efforts like SpaceX and his own. 

Also it bums me out that he never got to be a Bond villain like he wanted. Always thought he would have done an excellent job with the robotic voice and just being the total opposite of what you'd expect from a Bond's nemesis. 

Rest well Mr. Hawking.
$C: Never thought this day would come. One of those guys you just believe to be timeless. RIP
$C: One of the few people who transcends from Man to Legend in a single instance 
$C: RIP. Thanks for your contributions to humanity.
$C: We lost one amazing human being! Goodnight Mr. Hawking!
$C: He will be missed dearly, and surely remembered among names like Einstein and maybe Newton. Another giant whom which we should strand upon in the hopes of lengthening our foresight. RIP
$C: glad he held on long enough to die on the math nerdiest day of the year - 3.14


$C: It's amazing how off guard this is catching us. Of course it was going to happen. It was supposed to have happened like 50 years ago with his condition. But even though we should've expected it, it comes as such a surprise. He'll be missed greatly
$C: RIP. One of the greatest minds mankind has ever seen
$C: The doctors gave him 2 years when he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease at the age of 21, he live another 55, talk about sticking it up the odds. Feels like an honor to have been alive as the same time as this man.One of the greatest minds to have lived. Rest well sir.
$C: Good bye, Mr. Hawking! I hope you finally get the chance to observe the singularity.
$C: ‚ÄúRemember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. 
It matters that you don't just give up.‚Äù
$C: The proverbial Orks stopped believing in him.
$C: He will always be remembered as one of the greatest minds to have ever lived. 
$C: May that wonderful mind be free.
$C: Actually finding it really hard to believe, holy shit...
$C: This is one of those moments in time where 50 years from now people will ask you if you remember when it happened. Such an amazing and influential person deserves that honor in the history books
$C: Such an inspiring and interesting man... He will be missed greatly. 
$C: Damn. While all of the celebrity deaths in the past several years have been bad, none of them really had an impact on me. This is first type I was seriousely shocked about a high profile death. He was a huge role model to me and he will be dearly missed.
$C: There is a black hole in my heart today. 
$C: What the fuck. I never knew how much I appreciated this man till I started to tear up opening reddit on mobile.
$C: Stephen didn‚Äôt die, he just stopped emitting Hawking Radiation. 
$C: I've had his book A Brief History of Time sitting by my bed for a while. I've had it for years, when I began to have an interest in science. His writing was easy to read and informative for a kid growing up. It was a major influence for me in getting interested in astronomy.

I've been meaning to read it again, which is why it's on my night stand. It's not long either and I think I'll get to reading it now. He lived a long life, especially for his condition. He was popular and insightful. I like to think that it'd be good to celebrate his life by reading his works again. He had had a good run. No need to get terribly sad about it.
$C: Wow. Does anyone have a link to his AMA? I never followed up to see if/when he answered. 
$C: Cause of death: Software update gone awry
$C: He gave us a lot, in physics, donations, and understanding of the universe in general, very few humans will achieve his level of contributions to mankind, his work will inspire so many. what a successful life, he now passes the torch of knowledge for the next generations of wanderers.  RIP Genius. Thank you for what you revealed to us all.
$C: Today has been so eventful, wtf?!

* Rex Tillerson fired

* Mike Pompeo and Gina Haspel in

" Glushkov dead

* Stephen Hawking dead

* Pennsylvania special election still going and is 49.9% to 49.5%
$C: This truly makes my heart sad.
$C: I'm sad to hear this... He has been a staple in the scientific community. I wish he could be here longer to see more of the advancements being  made.
$C: I wish it would have been trump rip stephen
$C: His [last](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=qj74uXkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) published work was a children's book that he wrote with his daughter. That's a pretty nice one to end on. 
$C: I wonder if his "Heaven is just a fairy tale" statement is true or not. No matter, may he rest in peace ;-;
$C: I hope they conduct a thorough investigation. It's possible Russians were involved too.
$C: I cant believe this....RIP......
$C: It is indeed really surreal to think of someone who has taught the world so much aswell as someone everyone knew and respected ( hell even had a movie about him) to die unexpected. Honestly it came out of nowhere that ive been starting to think to myself of WHY im not reacting about it. Maybe its just the sheer shock of the fact that a man with so much offering to the world has come to a bitter end. He really was a revelation for the people and gave hope to more scientist. They mustve of thought , hell, if he can do it, i sure as hell am slacking and gotta get my sh*t straight.
Your a good man Hawking. Your going into the big books fellow.

$C: One of the greats. It's both sad and amazing considering the disease and his original prognosis. Everyone's number has to come due sometime though.
$C: Oh my god , no way!

My smile I held a moment ago ,  went away .. this brilliant man is gone.
$C: Rest in peace Mr. Hawking.
$C: I'm 24. I've seen "celebrity" deaths and have aways wondered why people got chocked up about it. I saw my Mom cry over Michael Jackson amd it never made sense. It does now. RIP.
$C: He was the Einstein of our generation. RIP
$C: It's hard to believe that he is gone, perhaps because he has already been immortalized in our minds. What a man, to be so worthy of a place among the figures of history long before his passing.
$C: It is really touching to see so many anon people being so respectful for once on this website 
$C: Rip legend, you won‚Äôt be forgotten.
$C: It has been an honor to live in the same time and age as this man. May he rest in peace and may he go down in history as one of humanity's most brilliant minds.
$C: In our minds, it seems, this legend would outlive us all. 
$C: Gods speed Mr. Hawking and Thank you
$C: Why did this catch me so off guard, did i think he was gonna live forever? Still, it's crazy how long he lived considering. He really lived a fulfilling life man, rest up.
$C: Many thoughts and thanks to all his friends and caretakers. 
$C: Damn.

He brought an understanding of science/physics to the common person.

RIP.

We'll miss you.
$C: ‚ÄúIntelligence is the ability to adapt to change.‚Äù
-Stephen Hawking 2014
$C: This is one of the random deaths that I think hit me like it did when I was young and Steve Irwin died. I just couldn't believe someone as amazing could go in a blink of an an without truly appreciating them while they were here. 
$C: With all the genius stuff aside, he had a beautiful mind, the world will seem like a lonlier place without him for a while, yet we're so lucky for having his him as long as we did. RIP, Stephen Hawking, and thank you for your inspiration.
$C: As we lose amazing people I hope more are growing up. 
$C: I‚Äôm hoping that somehow, his computer assimilated parts of his consciousness and that it can produce great ideas as this great scientist had. 
$C: Logged back in to pay my respects to Dr. Hawking. In a time where we need more people like you... sighhh... nevermind... rest in peace Dr. Hawking.
$C: My grandfather passed due to ALS. It can take anybody. Even an intellectual giant like Mr. Hawking.
$C: He was more machine than he was man...
$C: Im aware of who he is and what field of science he was a part of but can any one tl;dr or ELI5 the overview of his most major impacts on science as a whole?
$C: This man made made such monumential discoveries that in some cases only a few dozen people could even comprehend what he was doing. RIP to a Generational mind.
$C: ‚ÄúThere he goes. One of God's own prototypes. A high-powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production. Too weird to live, and too rare to die.‚Äù


$C: Yknow of all the celebrity deaths the past few years this one has hit me the hardest.  My heart just dropped man.

Now you're among the stars Mr. Hawking, godspeed sir.
$C: A genius and a guy with a great sense of humour. RIP. 

He lived way past what was expected, considering he had ALS. 
$C: He was my generation's Einstein. His work on black holes will impact many future generations.
$C: I always loved this guy. He's an inspiration!
$C: Hero‚Äôs are remembered but legends never die 
$C: Rest in Peace, Stephen. You‚Äôll be remembered 
$C: Oh man. I wasn‚Äôt ready for these feels just before going to bed...
$C: So as a player of Warhammer 40k I had always joked that Stephen Hawking was the Emperor, super smart , stuck in a chair , could be a dick at times but figured he did it for the good of every one, he passes away and then I find out that tomorrow we may be hit by a massive solar storm .

For other 40K players this equals. The Emperor has fallen the eye of Chaos has opened all hope is lost!! 
$C: RIP loved hearing him talk about science stuff as a kid
$C: Sad to see such a brilliant mind go. I remember just a few weeks ago watching his TED talks and then shortly after watching Into the Universe. Going to buy his book now and read it. Rest In Peace, Mr. Hawking <3
$C: I heard about his death on someone's Snapchat story, and for some reason I assumed it an Onion article, then I got on Reddit and was like "*WHAT*"
$C: In honour of the man.. they should do the entire eulogy in computer voice
$C: This is the first time I've ever been shocked at the news of the death of someone I've never met. Normally when I see one of these threads it just makes me mildly sad, but this made me audibly gasp.
$C: Shit! That's too bad. On the plus side, his life was very difficult in many ways and that's not a concern anymore. He'll be missed.
$C: o7     ..... godspeed you amazing man
$C: Hopefully you now know all the answers about the universe, rest in peace.
$C: Man, that really sucks.  That's the first celebrity death that's truly saddened me in a long time.

I kind of wish his remains could be preserved long enough to develop the technology to launch him into a black hole.  That way, over quadrillions of years, he would become Hawking radiation.
$C: [He would want us to Keep Talking.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dg1HBmo06w)
$C: Rest in peace Stephen. You were a man among children. You will be missed to no end. 
$C: Wow I'm shocked but glad he lived as long as he did. RIP Mr. Hawking. You inspired me to take up science and I'm thankful for it.
$C: It's upsetting that someone who was so bright, humorous and resilient died seeing the world in such a stupid, petty, and weak state. 
$C: wow, i never thought that this would be the next stephen hawking headline id see. rip 
$C: Man what a legacy this guy left
$C: I hope he made peace with his creator. Rest in peace sir, you deserve it, thank you for all your contributions to the world.
$C: Thank you for giving us great information about the world. 
$C: Damn that caught me off guard, and today is also Einstein's birthday guys.
$C: One of the greats. RIP
$C: Hawking radiation is named after him, he was a great man.
$C: I'd like to ALSO remember him for his [sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH8s4N15zdg) of [humor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8y5EXFMD4s) 
$C: Idk about you guys, but this never seemed like a thing that would happen.
$C: Rest In Peace Professor Hawking. May your spirit wander freely through the universe and discover all of its secrets. 
$C: Humanity's IQ just dipped several points. 
$C: Back to the dark ages :/
$C: R.I.P Hawking, Alright lets cremate that mofo of a scientific genius and put his ashes in a Tesla Rocket and shoot him toward the great Attractor! Who's With Me!?!?!?! After that we're all going streaking through the quadrant and gymnasium!!!! 
$C: At 76. Man, Hawking wasn't even that old. The things he could have yet achieved :/ We lost a great mind.
$C: With Hawking goes the nuclear age of physics. On his shoulders we build the new world.
$C: I read this and was in such disbelief at first I thought it was the onion. You will be missed Mr. Hawking.
$C: I literally just learned he was British. I never heard an accent though.
$C: He's having a party of his life right now high 5ing aliens!
$C: Rip. This one legitimately shocked me. Didn't expect this at all.
$C: And the world is less having lost him.  Truly a loss for the scientific community. 
$C: shine on you crazy diamond
$C: Rip Professor X. Well I guess he can find out if there‚Äôs an afterlife. 
$C: After chester's this is the most sucky death
$C: Suddenly feel even less secure in this world. It was nice knowing there was someone who understood things on a whole other level than the rest of us. "Give it to us straight, how fucked are we?" 
$C: I will never forget his epic rap battle in which he systematically dismantled Einstein. Rest in peace.
$C: RIP. Truly the Einstein of our generation.
$C: Wow RIP never seemed like he would die so soon.
$C: RIP mate.
Thank you for all you've done and your contributions.
The world became a better place for having you in it.
$C: his time on this earth well spent

his legacy *lives on*
$C: This really does sadden me - Stephen Hawking was one of the first scientists who really inspired me.  I'm very sad that he's gone now,  but I guess we must remember him for his actions and contributions, not for his disease.
$C: Goodnight, Stephen. And thanks for all the brains.
$C: Stephen Hawking isn't supposed to die :( 
$C: There's a story where he meets with another scientist in a strip club and upon arrival he was asked what he wanted to do first, talk science or see the girls

Hawking decided to opt for the latter
$C: And with that, the cosmos just got smaller.
$C: Death is such a interesting concept. So random. If anyone asked me to have 50 guesses on someone who‚Äôs dies tonight, I definitely wouldn‚Äôt have guessed him. 

Anyways, you‚Äôre studies and theoretical findings will forever be appreciated! Thanks for also being such a inspiration to all about the power of the human brain. Rip.
$C: We shall carry his will and spread out to other planets.
$C: Rest in peace Mr Hawking.
$C: I am at work right now and couldn't stop from saying holy shit. This is practically deviating. Like fuck.
$C: It‚Äôs amazing to look at all the things this man has achieved and the insight has given us all into the world around us how it works. You will be sorely missed Stephen
$C: It shocked me so much. I never met him but i wish i could have.
$C: Died on Pi day. Seems oddly poetic. RIP
$C: Holy shit. Open Reddit and THIS pops up in my face? Rip.
$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muo8sIfgXkY
$C: If one's death is signified by the last time someone mentions his name, Stephen will live forever.
$C: Rest easy my sweet price of the sky
$C: You will be missed, Mr. Hawking.
$C: Mortal body, timeless mind. Godspeed. 
$C: Only thing that gives me comfort about this is that he passed on Pi Day. Seems to almost fit.
$C: Thanks for inspiring me.. I still remember the day, back in 1994, when 12 y/o me reading in the bookstore Black Holes and Baby Universes. I asked my dad and mom to buy it for me.. it inspired me to learn and try to understand beyond my own limitations.
$C: As a therapist who treats people with ALS, thank you Dr. Hawking for giving many of them hope and courage. Farewell and safe travels into the beyond. 
$C: God damn this is a tragedy. It's painful to lose such a beautiful and intelligent mind. Hopefully we carry on his dream and follow through with his dreams and ideas for humanity.
$C: Rest in physics my good sir 
$C: Rest in Peace, Mr. Hawking. It was always comforting to know that you were out there, a brilliant man doing brilliant things. It is weird to be stripped of that comfort. I hope you rest easy and thank you for all that you did.
$C: Rip to an inspirational icon that history will never forget 
$C: The world lost a star today..rest in paradise! 
$C: I see "which celebrity death would shock you or affect you the most?" all the time on Reddit... This is a rough one. 
$C: A legendary human has left us today. We are worse off without him. 
$C: Rest In Peace Mr. Hawking. Your passion for science will always be remembered
$C: "If you are looking for trouble, you've found it." - Stephen Hawking on the Simpsons. Despite having such a terrible illness, he never lost his sense of humour. He's an inspiration to us all.
$C: I feel like everything I know about Physics came from "A Brief History of Time."

I would wager there are a lot of people out there with similiar feelings.

R.I.P. Professor Stephen Hawking

$C: Man this hits hard... he was one of those people that you just never imagined passing away. Rest In Peace Stephen Hawking. I know you‚Äôre out there among the stars now
$C: Damnit, this is not what I needed today.

I haven't ever been fazed by the death of an important figure before, but I feel pretty light chested right now :(
$C: Live Long and Prosper Hawking.

:(
$C: Wow, I just can't believe it. I've heard his name since I was a kid, so I guess in the back of my mind I just kind of thought about him just always being there. 

He will be missed. 
$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_tuPZNbuh8
$C: He was one of the brightest minds of this generation and... damn. This is what it must‚Äôve been like when Einstein died. 
$C: He thought me to reach for the stars and never stop believing. 

RIP
$C: Rip my dude. Thanks for making me feel smart when I was 10 and reading about your stuff 
$C: Hawking was diagnosed with ALS at age 21 and given two years to live... he defied every expectation a thousand times over. Nevertheless, I'm still shocked at our loss.
$C: Did anyone else think to themselves "We're fucked now." after hearing about this or is it just me? 

RIP brilliant mind, a true loss to the world. 
$C: This man was and is and always will be the reason I won't accept the average response of life, the universe, and everything. Thank you Stephen. God speed. 
$C: This is probably the first "celebrity" death in the past several years that's actually given me pause. Rest in piece, you smart bastard.
$C: What?! Nooo! This is a terrible loss to mankind! 
$C: I got the news when I opened my Carrot Weather app and she made an offhand comment. It made it all the more depressing.
$C: Personally I think this is the single biggest death in my entire life (I'm 24). It's awesome that he lived to 74 though 
$C: Stephen!!!! No!!!!! Dude I gotta watch the theory of everything and cry. I also hope Big Bang theory does a tribute 
$C: I read ‚ÄòA Brief History Of Time‚Äô when I was 13, and while much of the subject matter was way beyond my understanding at the time, it created such a profound sense of awe and wonder of our universe that I can hardly describe it in words. Goodnight, sweet prince. You will forever be enshrined in history as one of mankind‚Äôs greatest minds. 
$C: What a loss! Thank you so much Mr. Hawkings
$C: First Newton and now Hawking! Such a sad year
$C: Wow, wasn‚Äôt expecting this. RIP. 
$C: Rest in peace Stephen Hawking. He was my mentor, friend and colleague. YOU WILL BE MISSED!
$C: I was so sad and teary, but then the more I researched him I realized he lived a great life and was lucky to make it to the age he did. 

Still its so unbelievable, I am shocked as if a loved one died. 

Stephen Hawking is like... a figure you know? Its like if Albert Einstein died in our lifetimes. 

RIP
$C: RIP old friend. You don't know me, but I feel like I have known you all my life. üò•
$C: Wow, this is the first time I have been stunned by a death, celebrity or otherwise.

One of history's greatest scientists is dead, there is no longer a chance he will magically come up with solutions to some of our largest problems or questions. It's up to the rest of us. What a sobering moment for the world.
$C: One of the most inspiring scientists. I still look up to him.

Rest in peace, Mr. Hawking. Congratulations on living such a long, inspiring.
$C: Best example of making the most of the cards you‚Äôve been dealt, huge loss for humanity. Godspeed.
$C: He certainly beat the odds.  I hope there is an autopsy, his medical condition may teach us a lot. 

Godspeed.
$C: He's kind of always just been a part of the world ever since I've been alive. Will be strange not having him around anymore, I cannot believe it myself that he's gone.
$C: Still reading through his college thesis. I can comfortable say that this man's vast knowledge is almost unfathomable, even at such an early age. This is a tremendous loss.
$C: Imagining the somber sight of his empty wheelchair in his office
$C: [One of his finer moments](https://youtu.be/m21IgV8FFqQ).
$C: This is so surreal. I haven‚Äôt felt this, lost, within the loss of life in quite a while. 


$C: Thank you, Stephen, for your contributions to science. I'm happy you got to live a nice fulfilling life.
$C: He was my favorite simpsons character too RIP 
$C: Our generation's Einstein üò•
$C: Rest In Peace. May your legacy live on to be an inspiration for others.
$C: This is a huge lost to humanity.
$C: I desperately hope someone was writing down everything he said up to his unfortunate passing
$C: Time to listen to 'Starman' again. Space travel would never be possible without such fine companions as these. 
$C: I don't think he's really dead he probably found a way to travel between stars and is currently cruising through interstellar space. 
$C: The Mozart of Science. A medical miracle with his incredibly long life after being diagnosed with ALS. The face of modern day Science as we know it. This man will forever be remembered. Rest in Peace Stephen Hawking. He'll be dearly missed.
$C: His story is extremely inspiring. It's weird to think he won't be here to discover time travel. 
$C: I was hoping this wasn‚Äôt real.  Please say it‚Äôs not true.  
$C: Jesus Christ. My absolute hero, and one of the greatest minds of any generation, ever. RIP my friend.
$C: I found out who Stephen Hawking was during an episode of Dexters Laboratory when I was a kid in the 90s. I was fascinated immediately and started reading everything I could get my little hands on about him. Though he was a parody character of a few people, Hawking stood out to me. I am thanking not only Dexters Lab, but also Mr. Hawkings for my deep love of science and truth seeking. Thank you! 
$C: Take it away, pseudo-intellectuals on facebook!
$C: Wow, he is one tough mother fucker
$C: I bet someone is making a conspiracy theory as we speak
$C: Please don‚Äôt misinterpret this honest question as hateful or dismissive:

What things did he accomplish/contribute to better humanity?

He‚Äôs always referred to as the smartest person alive, but all I ever see is people interviewing him or random articles that say something like ‚ÄúStephen Hawking says such and such is possible.‚Äù I‚Äôm thinking his real contributions need more of a focus by the public.
$C: This is sad. But I think he lived a fulfilling life. He left his mark on history and will be remembered. I only wish he got to meet aliens. Oh well..
$C: Just yesterday I was thinking that it was silly for people to believe that Stephen Hawking should have any special insight into whether there is a god or not. I suppose he now has that insight (or possibly no insight at all).
$C: Damn, that‚Äôs so sad... and I just watched The Theory of Everything this month too. Makes me appreciate how much he went through that much more. Rest easy Mr. Hawking. 
$C: Is this how people felt when Einstein passed? I‚Äôm not a scientist so I‚Äôm sure I don‚Äôt fully appreciate all of Hawking‚Äôs contributions, but it feels almost like Superman died. An example of peak human mental performance is gone. Damn. 
$C: I guess I always thought he would be the first human to have his mind uploaded into a computer and never die. A floating head in a jar of sorts. He was truly an inspiration to me and I am pretty down about this news. 
$C: [A Brief History of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brief_History_of_Time) is one of my all time favorite astrophysics books. After I had spent a long time during and after college being uninspired and and just bleh with life, reading this and Francis Crick's Astonishing Hypothesis got me back to the "whoa" that life and our universe is freaking amazing again. In his book, Hawking has a great way of explaining complex topics and keeping them interesting.
$C: The collective intelligence on earth has probably gone down by 20 %
$C: This makes me so fucking sad.... rest in peace
$C: An inspiration to all, future scientists pursuing a quest for knowledge and anyone who feels as though something has got the best of them. Made it through all the difficulty in his life and still managed to accomplish and live a more full life than many ever could. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: He said fuck you to ALS. What a legend.
$C: This is shocking. I just saw him in news and I hoped he is still good. Turned on Reddit and saw this news. RIP. 
$C: It's really strange, but there's a Futurama episode on SYFY right now with him in it...
$C: One of the greatest minds to have been. 

$C: RIP Stephen Hawking. You've done a great service for the scientific community and humanity.
$C: A truly sad day for humans. Thank you for all your work Mr. Hawking.
$C: Wow that just smacked me across the face. Out of the blue.
$C: I choose to remember him [patrolling Cambridge in his robotic exoskeleton](https://www.theonion.com/stephen-hawking-builds-robotic-exoskeleton-1819564353). 
$C: Rest In Peace, Dr Hawking, one of my heroes. One of those people you just assumed was immortal.
$C: Damn man......he wad great
$C: The only other deaths to hit me this hard were Owen Hart, Satoshi Kon, and Robin Williams.

I guess my Mt Rushmore is now complete üò≠
$C: Never thought he would die
$C: Hawking was a real credit to humanity. Not only was he a genius and a huge boon to the scientific community but he overcame his disability to do it. If anything, he is an inspiration to astronomers and the disabled alike. I like to think he‚Äôs gone to a place that can answer all his questions about the universe. 
$C: Rip you will be missed
$C: [Just thought it was appropriate to put this link here, considering what just happened.](http://www.azquotes.com/author/6401-Stephen_Hawking)
$C: Weird how the idea of him dying never really occurred to us after a certain point.
$C: Rip to one of the great humans in the modern era...
$C: The Big Bang Theory is rushing to re-film Monday's episode.
$C: A great man with a great legacy who greatly contributed to our understanding of the universe. RIP Stephen.
$C: RIP Stephen Hawking man. You inspired numerous minds and will continue to for generations to come.
$C: RIP. I am humbled to have lived on this Earth while he did.
$C: Hawking was one of the main reasons why I studied science after high school. Although I never pursued my initial goal of studying astrophysics, I owe him a lot. Goodbye Dr. Hawking and god speed.
$C: Saddest Windows shutdown chime ever.
$C: Goddamn, Hawking was one of those guys who felt like they would be around forever. RIP
$C: We have lost a great man.

$C: RIP Dr Hawking, thank you for all that you've done 
$C: "We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that, I am extremely grateful." -Hawking
$C: We can‚Äôt afford to be losing smart people right now. 

RIP you amazing human. 
$C: take it easy stephen hawking o7
$C: Just before Pi Day :(

Rest in peace, Dr. Hawking. You deserve it. 
$C: I came here to cry my eyes out, but while I was reading through these comments I realized how many people this man had an impact on. When I read Mr. Hawking had passed, I was nervous that we might never have another mind like his. I know now that because of him, and the people who he has influenced, we have the potential for far greater. 

Thank you Stephen. 
$C: RIP to the greatest astrophysicists ever. Will truly miss this amazing human and his talks when he discovered things. RIP. 
$C: Holy shit. This is a horribly saddening thing to read right after I got out of class...
$C: The world is a little bit dimmer, but a whole lot brighter than it ever would have been without him in it. 
$C: It may seem silly to many that the death of someone outside family/friends who I have never met could move me to tears, but this is one of those. His contributions to science in spite of his physical limitations have always been inspiring to me.
$C: "For much of his time in the public eye, his illness confined him to a wheelchair and, since 985, he communicated through a computer, which he operated with his cheek."

He apparently lived a lot longer then we all knew
$C: He was the greatest mind our species has produced. Ergo, he was the greatest mind we know of in our observable universe. A true loss for humanity.
$C: Truly a sad day. He's the reason I'm studying physics today and sparked my curiosity of the cosmos. Rest in peace. May you be one with your mind and body <3<3<3
$C: If there's anyone who deserves to witness humanity create mind-blowing technology, explore planets and make extraterrestrial contact, it's Hawking. RIP
$C: The guy was living on borrowed time and still managed to achieve more than any of us will in our lifetime.

Imagine what you'd be capable of if you knew that tomorrow could be your last day.
$C: Great man will be missed
$C: What a great loss. I think he would have wanted to go out on Pi Day though.
$C: A great mind invested in our future and progress, he will always be remembered 
$C: Quite possibly the smartest person to have ever lived. Even with his disability he never let it slow him down. Rest in peace, and thank you.
$C: I didn't expect his passing to hit me this hard.
$C: He had a good run.  Got dealt a bad hand and made the very best out of it.  Lasted longer than most thought he would.
$C: Usually when people are diagnosed with als they die within four years. He lived 13 times that, and im so glad he did
$C: He will be remembered centuries from now, immortalized along side all of humanity's greatest minds. It is truly a pleasure to have lived during his time. 

Thank you, Stephen. 
$C: Holy fucking shit. This genuinely brought tears to my eyes.
$C: Fuckin hell. Talk about a blindside. RIP Good Sir, you will be missed.
$C: I was scrolling through some of my local news stuff and brought up Google news and seen the headline. I'm in total shock and disbelief. Farewell to one of the most brilliant and truly inspirational persons this world has ever seen
$C: Rest In Peace science man

$C: We lost a great person today.
$C: O shit this is so surprising .-.
$C:  Truly a hero, an icon, an inspiration to many and proof that even with the greatest of challenges greatness can overcome.

A sad day for science and the world but his legacy will last forever, And he outlived expectation on so many levels it is almost incomprehensible.
$C: I was just telling my mom about how his book, "The Universe In A Nutshell" was one of my favorite books when I was younger. Partially because I didn't  understand most of it, which made me even more curioius about the world around me. And because his language and relatively simple explanations about the cosmos made the Universe seem so beautiful. RIP Mr. Hawking, your lessons inspired a lot of curious kids and we were all lucky to have you.
$C: RIP to the world's first cyborg and super evil genius, the glorious man he was.
$C: rip to a man who never have up.
$C: Part of me thinks it was too soon for him to go, however the other part of me said he had a great run and lived a fulling life for someone with ALS.

He will be missed.
$C: Rest in peace Stephen Hawking. Thank you for instilling in us a sense of wonder and curiosity about our universe, and what could potentially be out there. You may have left us, but your legacy will live on.
$C: Press F to pay respects.

F
$C: Rest in peace.

Truly the end of an era.
$C: He's not gone, he just found a better dimension.
$C: I am very emotional about this. He was one of the greatest minds of all time. This is a man who comes along once in a generation and probably once in a century. I, or my not-yet-born children, will probably not see another like him.
$C: Oh no... I am crying! I didn‚Äôt know I would feel like this... I didn‚Äôt know I would be so upset about a man I‚Äôve never met... 
I am so very sad about this üòñ 
I wish it were not true
$C: Hawking is just one of those people you just assume will never die, like you forget that they're still human. Luckily, his name will live on forever. He's an amazing inspiration, having overcome the odds and accomplishing so much more than what was expected of him. To me, he lives on, and will be in future generation's textbooks for years to come.
$C: He‚Äôs not dead. He‚Äôs just transformed into another type of energy.
$C: It is pi day here - so thats something. A great scientist dying on pi day

$C: I used to just think that he was the way he was because he was just so smart that the rest of his body just shut down so it could power just his brain.

I can even imagine how a human being can see things on a level he saw them. That's not even something you can learn. That just a gift you're born with.

But in the end, even though he said we need to leave earth...i just don't see it happening. Nothing else in our solar system is inhabitable and the next closest thing is several light years away. We have nothing even close to light speed and it is physically impossible to ever move faster than light while having any kind of mass whatsoever.

Meaning even with the estimated rate of technological progression, our great times 100 grandchildren will never come close to the next closest thing.
$C: I actually thought about him not that long ago and thought, wow he just seems immortal. He's done more in his life than most people and he did it from a wheelchair. The man is a legend. And he was on the Big Bang Theory, so that's always cool.
$C: He will be missed dearly 
$C: RIP to one of the greatest minds in human history
$C: RIP.  I didn't expect this so suddenly. 
$C: Thats so fucking sad! I loved him!
$C: Rest in peace gentle star
$C: What an incredible life led in direct defiance of the odds stacked against him. 
$C: He has so many pending bets with other physicist, what are they going to do? 
$C: It's strange to think about people reading about his life and also this day that he passed away. He will definitely be remembered for centuries to come. 
$C: He'll be back. Time travel + cure || clone.
$C: Today we lost a world renown treasure. A great mind, and a revolutionary thinker. Go unto the sweet expanse, for you are one with the stars now.
$C: Normally the deaths of famous people don't really hit me, but this one does. He was a true inspiration of mine and the work he was able to do despite his illness is a testament to willpower and endurance of a great mind. He will undoubtedly be missed.
$C: It feels unreal to me. Every 6 months or so you would have an article about him or something that he proposed, but this is not what I expected. The worst part, and I believe it is the emptiest for a lot of us, is the fact that we cannot put another such person in his place - at least not at the moment. His work will be respected for a long time (if not forever) and we will keep him in our memories.
$C: Now he's what he loved most; the universe. 

This seems appropriate:
> You want a physicist to speak at your funeral. You want the physicist to talk to your grieving family about the conservation of energy, so they will understand that your energy has not died. You want the physicist to remind your sobbing mother about the first law of thermodynamics; that no energy gets created in the universe, and none is destroyed. You want your mother to know that all your energy, every vibration, every Btu of heat, every wave of every particle that was her beloved child remains with her in this world. You want the physicist to tell your weeping father that amid energies of the cosmos, you gave as good as you got.

>And at one point you'd hope that the physicist would step down from the pulpit and walk to your brokenhearted spouse there in the pew and tell him that all the photons that ever bounced off your face, all the particles whose paths were interrupted by your smile, by the touch of your hair, hundreds of trillions of particles, have raced off like children, their ways forever changed by you. And as your widow rocks in the arms of a loving family, may the physicist let her know that all the photons that bounced from you were gathered in the particle detectors that are her eyes, that those photons created within her constellations of electromagnetically charged neurons whose energy will go on forever.

>And the physicist will remind the congregation of how much of all our energy is given off as heat. There may be a few fanning themselves with their programs as he says it. And he will tell them that the warmth that flowed through you in life is still here, still part of all that we are, even as we who mourn continue the heat of our own lives.

>And you'll want the physicist to explain to those who loved you that they need not have faith; indeed, they should not have faith. Let them know that they can measure, that scientists have measured precisely the conservation of energy and found it accurate, verifiable and consistent across space and time. You can hope your family will examine the evidence and satisfy themselves that the science is sound and that they'll be comforted to know your energy's still around. According to the law of the conservation of energy, not a bit of you is gone; you're just less orderly. Amen.

‚Äì Aaron Freeman
$C: It's the first death that actually rings with me, just because I actually knew about him before he died. 
$C: Oh no,  quick! Cryogenically freeze him to revive him in the future like Futurama Nixon. 
$C: Woah. I had to double take... RIP
$C: "I‚Äôm not afraid of death, but I‚Äôm in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first."

Stephen Hawking


$C: It's hard to think that yesterday we lived with one of the greatest scientists of our time. It really bums me out to think that he died just shortly before he could have seen a picture of a black hole too.
$C: The collective intelligence level of the human species has fallen drastically tonight...

Rest in Peace, Mr. Hawking. Thank you for all you contributed to your fellow humans. 
$C: Heaven is going to have one hell of a Pi Day when he takes those first steps through the Pearly Gates.
$C: Somebody put two batteries in him, quick!
$C: The world has lost a great mind. A tragedy we should all mourn. He'll be remembered with admiration and reverence. 
$C: Wow. This doesn‚Äôt seem real at all. I guess his disease kind of foreshadowed this, but it never crossed my mind. 

Rest In Peace, Mr. Hawking. Thank you for everything you‚Äôve done for humanity. 
$C: Damn, just yesterday I was talking about how fucking amazing this guys resolve for science was. 

Wrote one of the best books of all time and can't even physically move. 

Inspiration. 

RIP
$C: So he died on Pi Day over there? Wow 
$C: Rest in peace, Professor Hawking. We're gonna miss you.
$C: Dang I'm on Boost and I'm refreshing this post repeatedly and every time it's being upvoted >100 times. (deservedly so)
$C: Damn, for some reason his passing kind of hits me a bit harder than other famous people. This man was absolutely fascinating, one of mankind‚Äôs most brilliant and important people among the likes of Einstein, Socrates, Newton and Galileo...but he was ours. And he was fucking awesome. 



$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnq98a0UJPs
$C: Hawking translated complex explanations to the common man. The first time I grasped the cosmic power of a black hole and how they're formed by supernova was from Hawking. As a teen it blew my mind. 
$C: What is dead may never die
$C: Just as we're on the brink of some amazing breakthroughs... He deserved to see them :/
$C: No words. Just the sound of silence
$C: The world feel dumber
$C: Thank you for not dying in 2016. I would have been crushed.
$C: I'm so overwhelmed at the thought of all Stephen Hawking has helped humankind understand, and so thankful he lived. Didn't expect to cry tonight... Man. RIP you magnificent bastard, it was a gift to have you. 
$C: Its weird how i didnt see this coming
$C: RIP a legend, role model, one of the greatest minds of our time. Most people probably don‚Äôt know much about what he‚Äôs worked on, I can‚Äôt say that I know much past what my professor dedicated a single lecture to after we finished course content. But extracted the best life he could from the hand he was given, and I have the upmost respect for him.

Condolences to his family.
$C: Do you think he‚Äôs on a stairway to heaven?
$C: Lou Gehrig's disease is usually incredibly fatal. The fact that the world had Dr. Hawking as long as we did is a miracle.

RIP, Dr. Hawking. The world will be a little bit darker without you
$C: How can a robot die?
$C: I just figured at this point he was eternal 
$C: Even though deep down I knew sooner or later this would happen, my mind chose to believe that he would end up outliving us all.
$C: Wow, I can't believe this... he was a true leader of science. I loved reading about this man and loved watching his documentaries since I was a kid... this news has just thrown me into shock.
RIP.
$C: Not to distract or diminish the blow of losing such an incredible mind, but was anyone else's first thought "Holy shit, what if the big reveal is coming?" I envision a secret project that Hawking had secretly poured his entire life's work into- a project that's revelations would change the way we understand the world around us. A theory that was so earth-shattering that it threatened the constructs of life as we know it. One that he felt best be revealed only upon his death.

I mean, I can obviously see how this is crackpot- it sounds like a cheesy plot from a B-grade Hollywood movie that everyone had big hopes for (probably with your token star leads like Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Chastain) but ultimately failed to deliver because it's too sappy or trying to hard for an Indie vibe. I just find it so hard to believe that this is the end of his impact on the world. If anyone was going to fuck our status quo up in any of our lifetimes, I was sure it would be Hawking.
$C: I wonder if his computer needs a password to log in. Rest in peace Mr Hawking.
$C: Amazing he lived until 76. Boggles my mind. RIP
$C: This is just devastating, so glad he lived such a long and productive life.
$C: I know I sound selfish considering he had so many years, but did he really have to go out right now--amidst all this shit? I mean, I'm not a believer in signs much but I can see how people do. Fact is: humans are so much stronger from his mind, and terribly weaker without it. 


$C: Thank you Stephen Hawking for your contributions to science and humanity.
$C: They should name a Supermassive Black Hole after him.
$C: I will miss you. RIP Stephen Hawking.
$C: I knew he wasn‚Äôt immortal but at the same time I find myself completely dumbfounded right now.
Humanity has just lost one of the greatest minds of this generation and what the fuck?
$C: wtf this does not feel real.  rip
$C: 50 years longer than I would've lasted. RIP to a great man of science. 
$C: >For much of his time in the public eye, his illness confined him to a wheelchair and, **since 985**, he communicated through a computer, which he operated with his cheek.

He was a lot older than I thought.
$C: They named an asteroid after him too.. which will make its next closest approach to Earth on July 16, 2018. 
$C: This  can't be real , can it? The world has truly lost something here 
$C: He‚Äôll be back. In another dimension.
$C: May he truly experience the universe. Thank you for all the brilliant findings, Stephen. Rest In Peace.
$C: One of the most brilliant minds to ever grace Earth, and the reason many became interested in science. The universe just lost an amazing being. Rest in peace, Stephen Hawking.
$C: One of our brightest lights has gone out 
$C: Wow, was not expecting this at all...
$C: It's still amazing that he lived this long though
$C: He is a legend in the scientific community, probably one of the greats of the 20th century if we're being real. He will *never* be forgotten.
$C: I'm genuinely in shock. I thought he had more time, even with his condition.
I don't know how to process this. I always equated him to a living Einstein in the sense of living in the same Era as a visionary scientist.
Rest in peace, and thank you for all you've done
$C: No... this is news I didn‚Äôt want... 
$C: I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened.
$C: Shocked, for some reason not sad, but just shocked, I have the same feeling I had when MJ passed, only celeb death so far that really hit me was Paul Walker.  
  
I'm still in disbelief of the news, I'm unsure at the moment of the official cause of death, but normally you hear about a celebrity being rushed to hospital or something prior to the news, just all of a sudden gone.  
  
Stevens legacy will live on forever, he accomplished so much with his time here on Earth and inspired many generations. Sad day for sure, I hope it was a smooth painless passing and he's somewhere happy.
$C: It's kind of fitting he died on Pi Day. RIP
$C: Hawking was always one of those great inspirations in my life and is the reason I fell so in love with Physics from such a young age. I can only hope that one day I can redeem myself from dropping out of a physics degree program to perhaps carry on the legacy that he has left behind.

I just finished reading The Grand Design by himself and Leonard Mlodinow a few months back and I do hope that if there is an after life that Mr. Hawking finds himself at the highest peak of the largest library containing every answer to any question he ever posed in that book and in his life for his thirst for knowledge and his desire to share that knowledge with the world has definitely granted him that privilege to say the least.

To say the least, the legacy he leaves behind as far as the face of humanity is concerned is astonishing as it is our only hope that we heed this great man's words and find a new home amongst the stars as our planet is sadly already too far gone.

Perhaps I'll be the one to discover a quantum drive that bends time and space for humanities salvation or perhaps the music I now make will inspire someone to but, Mr. Hawking, know that you are missed by millions of dreamers and hopefuls like myself.
$C: Just a coincidence that SH was born on the same day Galileo died and died on pi day. Science is conveying something about signs.
$C: Just change his battery. 
$C: "If human life were long enough to find the ultimate theory, everything would have been solved by previous generations. Nothing would be left to be discovered."

-- One of the most inspirational men to have ever lived
$C: When he was diagnosed at 21, he was expected to live only two more years. Brilliant man who lived a brilliant life. 
$C: Aw man.


Rest In Peace, and Mr. Hawking.
$C: Typo at the end says he's been using a computer since 985, not 1985
$C: "I have noticed even people who claim everything is predestined, and that we can do nothing to change it, look before they cross the road"
$C: Will be missed for his amazing mind and his amazing quotes. You can rest in peace.
$C: What‚Äôs sad is the comments on the yahoo article about how he ‚Äúnow knows there‚Äôs a god‚Äù.  
How do those people not see how screwed up that is to say? 
$C: Rest in peace. May we heed his words.
$C: It really is thanks to Stephen Hawking's book "A brief history of time" that pushed me to learn more about the Universe and science in general.   
A real loss to the world and human kind, my thoughts are with his family. RIP 
$C: The man died on Pi day. Truly fitting for a guy like that.
$C: I.......I was not ready for this. I think it's fair in saying that people all over the world will miss his presence. A true genius. Rest in Peace.
$C: Physicist Stephen Hawking proves immortality is in fact possible! RIP good Sir
$C: He occupied the same post as Isaac Newton. [The Lucasian Chair of Mathematics at Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasian_Professor_of_Mathematics) 

I believe he signed on the same ledger as Isaac Newton. But can't confirm.
$C: Woah. 

The last video I watched was Charlie Day on Jimmy Fallon. They had to guess what movie each other was describing and Charlie Day said ‚ÄúDead Guy. Wheelchair. ‚Äú Jimmy Fallon guessed *Theory of Everything* (it was *Weekend at Bernie‚Äôs*)

I actually said ‚ÄúStephen Hawking‚Äôs not dead you idiot‚Äù out loud. 

And I am now, unfortunately, the idiot. 
$C: "If we do discover a complete theory, it should in time be understandable in broad principle by everyone, not just a few scientists. Then we shall all, philosophers, scientists, and just ordinary people, be able to take part in the discussion of the question of why it is that we and the universe exist. If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason - for then we would know the mind of God."

I don't usually remember what it is I was doing or where I was when finishing most books. I do remember though when finishing reading "A Brief History of Time." I read these final words while listening to Hand of God by Jon Bellion while flying back from Portland Oregon after visiting my mother on school break. It was a pretty emotional experience for me, for some reason. I've always had a convoluted relationship with religion, sometimes believing wholeheartedly in a higher power and sometimes thinking we're all just star dust that was given enough time to start thinking about itself. That flight just muddied the lines for me even more, and I think I'm a better person for it.

So thank you, Stephen Hawking, for your absolutely brilliant book and for making my belief all the more complicated. 
$C: Leonard Susskind chuckles to himself "heh, I win again"

Jokes aside, I'm sure he's gutted by this news. 
$C: Elon Musk really should shoot his embalmed body and wheel chair into space.....just sayin'
$C: Even though I‚Äôve never met him, and a incurable disease. His contributions to science and his family are unparalleled. 
$C: the man was a legend plane and simple
$C: Literally just got out of the lab working on quasar data, thought of him, and the next thing is this news comes across my phone. He was one of my earliest inspirations for pursuing cosmology. He will be missed. 
$C: Wow.  Not surprised, but not expecting that. Amazing guy that not only came up with new ideas, but inspired people to do the same.
$C: So long, Space Cowboy. I really respected you and you made a positive change in my life. Thank you so much.
$C: This is always the first thing I think of when I hear his name
https://youtu.be/BjU4FSqhbKM
$C: This seriously felt like a blind punch to my face. He is last person you would expect to die and the last you would wish to die. Rest In Peace.
$C: They should continue to wheel his body in the chair, and let someone else control the computer. So we can at least have hawking for a few more weeks :(
$C: Pretty good for someone who was supposed to die in 1965.
$C: In genuine shock. R.I.P
$C: Truly sad to hear of his passing. It was an honor to live while he did. Rest in peace, good sir. You had one hell of a run.
$C: He may be dead, but he sure won‚Äôt be forgotten.
$C: I don't even really know who he is, and I see these "so and so died" frequently enough, but this is the firsts one that has made me gasp and actually say "Oh no!" RIP :(
$C: Google says he died on Pi Day (too early, or different timezones?). Fitting.
$C: And today's the birthday of Albert Einstein, crazy coincidence.
$C: Press F to pay respect.
*FFFFFFFFFFFF*
$C: Losing one of the greatest physicists on Albert Einstein's birthday...
$C: There's a void with him gone now. Hopefully one day someone will have the answers. 
$C: It doesn't have to be like this.
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking.
$C: *Windows XP closing sound*

$C: Has anyone just tried unplugging and plugging back in?
$C: What a big shocker, I never thought I'd see the day this  headline would pop up in my feed. 

I remember an awesome quote from him but can think of the video I saw it in, he's talking about black holes, and he says something along the lines of "So if you ever feel like you are in a black hole, hold on, there might be something on the other side"
$C: Guys he believed in time travel so you can just go back in time and see him so he isn't dead. 
$C: Well shit.  I guess now would be as good a time as any to start reading his books.
$C: Geez, basically as long as I've been alive, Hawking has been a sort of symbol of inspiration and academia to me.
$C: It feels so fucking weird for hawking to die. He has done so much for us goddamn
$C: What a role model, not just to me but to so many. I'll miss him so much.
$C: He was able to outlive his life expectancy from ALS like 50 years.  Thats pretty awesome.

"The greatest enemy of Knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge"
~Stephen Hawking
$C: Someone told me he died, so I rushed to the front page of reddit to verify it. Three posts so far,
$C: ‚ÄúTry to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious, and however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. It matters that you don‚Äôt just give up.‚Äù

Rest in peace, Stephen! We will never forget you.
$C: What a troll. Three days ago he came out and said he had figured out the answer to the universe. Stephen, you dick, I'm going to miss you
$C: So fucked up that my phone alerts me of Gigi and  Zayns breakup, but I had to find this out through reddit ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

$C: Let's not forget that Professor Hawking liked physics but loved cartoons. [Here he is talking about his guest appearance on the Simpsons.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei-pKsNiINk)
$C: Man he looked good for his age. May you rest in peace Professor Hawking.
$C: Was not expecting this when I opened Reddit for the night.
$C: I thought he died a few years ago! ü§îüòû
$C: As a young physics student who has been heavily influenced by him this pain me in a way I never thought it would, it feels like my mentor is gone, even tho I haven‚Äôt ever even seen him. It‚Äôs almost impossible to explain. 
$C: It's kind of fitting in a sense that he died on Pi day.
$C: Damn. Very hard to believe... just heard a report on him the other day. He seemed fine... it goes to show, life can end at any second... kind of scary...
$C: One of the greatest heroes of our time. A man who had an illness that should have killed him in two years. He went for well over 50. And he accomplished so much. From science, to even comedy. An inspiration that you can accomplish SO MUCH with even so little.
$C: This is a huge tragedy for the scientific community. Whenever I thought of who smartest people in the world would be, it was always Einstein and Hawkings. He lived on borrowed time. This crazy guy lived far beyond what should have been possible. He will be remembered as a legend and will never be forgotten
$C:  Rest in Peace Mr. Hawking, and thank you for all that you have done, in word and deed. A truly great man in every sense of the word, and I will sorely miss you. 
$C: My heart...

I still remember the excitement of watching his TV shows for the first time and having my mind blown around every corner. 

I always hoped I'd get to meet him one day..
$C: Thankful for the time he was here to share everything he had to offer with us. Rest In Peace 
$C: One day we came from star dust, and one day we will become start dust. What we once were we will become agian and the circle we begin anew. RIP Steven Hawking 1942-2018.
$C: That's quite surprising for me since he lived with his diseases for so long I can't imagine him well passing away, Well rest assured R. I. P Stephen hawking and those memes you gave us too
$C: RIP. May God comfort his family and friends.
$C: I was just think of him before I opened my laptop. I was wondering if he said hood or bonnet for a car. Not super exciting, but weird how these things happen. It's a sad day
$C: This is so unexpected. RIP. Someone the world will NEVER forget.
$C: "You once stated that there could be an infinite number of parallel universes, so theoretically there could be a universe where I‚Äôm smarter than you," opined (John) Oliver.¬†"Yes," replied Hawking. "And also a universe where you‚Äôre funny."
$C: Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change. 
$C: Man,I was just researching him yesterday...Can‚Äôt believe it.May he Rest In Peace!
$C: A great mind. He will be missed. I know of nobody who could replace him.
$C: He honestly lived such an amazing life that it made him seem immortal. 
$C: That sucks, Rest In Peace! 
$C: Now who's the smartest person in the world?! 
$C: Fuck. There goes my Wednesday.
$C: He had to die in order to evolve into Stephen Eagling.
$C: Someone told me this and I thought this was a joke until I checked online. I had no idea he was 76 though!

What an incredible man. He will go down in history. 
$C: when I was a kid my father was doing some maths/black hole stuff at Cambridge University.  We stayed with one of Stephen Hawking's nurses and she gave me a very worn and beaten copy of 'A Brief History of Time'; reading it was one of the things that pushed me into a career in science.
$C: There aren't many people in this world that can get such a positive response from Reddit. The man did good.
$C: I seriously thought he would out live me and I'm like 20. 
$C: What a sad day for the world. If you haven't seen the movie "The Theory of Everything", now might be a great time to. Minds like his will never ever be forgotten.
$C: Wow. This came straight out of left field. RIP Stephen.
$C: You know, I think we all knew it was going to happen sooner than later, but still I was absolutely speechless when I saw the news

Is a sad day for humanity, truly a sad day
$C: Wait...the article says four children, how in the world did he have four kids if he contracted ALS when he was 21?
$C: This is one celebrity death I actually rather care about... Who knows how much he could have provided?

It's with a heavy heart that I welcome the floodgates of topical memes. May our dank please him, wherever he is. (;_;)7
$C: this news hit me like a semi truck. this makes me feel numb. 
$C: I'm crying into my pillow tonight then going to bed :(
$C: This is really unexpected.

RIP Dr Hawking
$C: "Life would be tragic if it weren't funny." -Stephen Hawking

Well, Mr. Hawking, I'm not laughing. This isn't funny.
$C: Unexpected as fuck, was just texting someone and just got on Reddit and saw this, Jesus christ, anyone can go this fast, even though he lived long as fuck, RIP
$C: This is ACTUALLY someone who I am VERY sad of passing away. His life had a actual meaning here.
$C: RIP

A true visionary and a inspiring figure to every science enthusiast around the world
$C: They need to name a satellite after him or something, pay him respects you know...
$C: I hated upvoting this
$C: Holy crap, this caught me off guard. RIP
$C: Holy shit, that's crazy. I was completely unprepared for him dying, which is pretty crazy considering he lived to be 76 even though he was only expected to live to be less than 25.
$C: Very sad to hear the news, but what an incredible legacy to leave behind. I feel immensely privileged to have been alive at the same time as such an iconic figure.
$C: Died on Pi Day..... Mavervelous! What a interesting coincidence.
$C: Just realised he died on Albert Einsteins birthday.
$C: hey! I just googled Einstein and Hawking on two different tabs. Wtf, Einstein died at the age of 76. Hawking died at the age of 76 on Today (March 14th) which was the same date that Albert Einstein was born in 1879. Hawking died exactly 139 years later.Ôªø


RIP Hawking but damn, his death comes off as a strange coincidence regarding Einstein's birth date and age of death. 


$C: It funny, He never looked as old as he was. I could have sworn he was 20 years younger.
$C: RIP, Stephen Hawking was a great scientist and thinker, one who truly wanted to make humanity a better place.  I‚Äôm very thankful for all that he has done for us.
$C: Now this is someone people should feel bad about passing. The world is a worse place without this this mind in it.
$C: "To live and die in a world where one has strived to help man reach his true pinnacle of technological success is a life worth lived" 
$C: Have fun joining the stars Stephen
$C: We are running out of good guys
$C: Fact:
Stephen Hawking's birthday = Galileo's 300th death anniversary
Stephen Hawking's death = Albert Einstein's birth anniversary
$C: In no time Stephen hawking would become Stephen king ... an example of how rumors start .
$C: Wow I've been reading this and it's still hard to believe. RIP Steven Hawking.
$C: The star that burns twice as bright burns half as long.   
  
RIP
$C: Rest in Peace Stephen Hawking
$C: So no Wall-E 2 then?
$C: The man who loved God proceeded the man who hated God in death. 
$C: Damn. He accomplished so much, hopefully someone can carry on his legacy.
$C: Mankind's average I has dropped so hard today. RIP Mr. Hawking
$C: Rest in Peace. He will be missed.
$C: I was just reading earlier today about why he has lasted so much longer than most other people with ALS do. Now I'm sad.
$C: He didn't die. He simply uploaded his consciousness into the universe. 
$C: Cant they just turn him off and back on again? 
$C: I don't understand why this came as a shock to me. I guess I always just thought of him as a staple in the world, something that just *is* \- despite is age and illness. But wow, that really came as a shock. Incredibly sad. 
$C: I got here early enough to comment but I dont know what to say. 

RIP Stephen Hawking
$C: All I can say is wow, RIP.
$C: [No...not me](https://youtu.be/AW-p8s_HCCo)
$C: It's a shame I got on Facebook and saw this there first. The nasty religious comments about how he's burning in hell because he was an atheist reminded me that I need to uninstall that toxic app. 
$C: I thought he died 5 years ago and that was why they made the movie.
$C:  I can't belive this, :( what a great mind we loose! 
$C: I'm having a hard time believing this is real. Death is just a Theory like gravity right? :(
$C: He beat Einstein in a rap battle. 
$C: Did he technically die on pi day? RIP to a truely amazing individual. 
$C: I was just listening to a Simpsons history audiobook this morning that mentioned the time they had him on the show. They said he had a great sense of humor. He told this story to the Simpsons staff.  ‚ÄúOne of the things he likes to do is tell his driver to slow down. So one of his kids reprogrammed his chair so when he try to do that it said ‚ÄòGo you bastard go!‚Äô‚Äù
$C: And the average intelligence on earth just took a nosedive. RIP!
$C: Wow um didn‚Äôt see that coming 
$C: Into the ultimate truth of the universe. Which is nothingness.
$C: Our generation's Einstein. Rest in Peace, and thank you.
$C: https://youtu.be/VXO1g2UiPLo
$C: Alright, let's all build a time machine and visit his time traveller's party he had, and make him swear to not tell anyone. 
$C: The universe just took a major hit. We will recover in folds.
$C: I bet people who were around when Einstein died felt the way I feel right now.  I can't believe he is no longer with us.  He was a true icon for the human race.  
$C: He died on piday. 3.14



Edit: I completely read the date wrong. It‚Äôs 3/13 where I am. But I suppose if he was in London, it could have been pi day for him.
$C: What a tragic loss of a brilliant mind and an amazing person.  Rest in Peace, Mr. Hawking.
$C: Guy was a legend. He will be remembered for as long as civilization survives.. with Einstein.. Bohr, Newton, Copernicus.
RIP.
$C: I‚Äôm in shock, not only because he passed away, but because literally, this morning my students asked me who he was and I went on and didn‚Äôt care about the class. All I did was talk about him. Rest In Peace. 
$C: We have lost a great man, with a great mind. RIP Mr. Hawking. 
$C: The world has lost one of the greatest minds that ever lived. We were lucky to have him for as long as we did.

Give my regards to Sagan if you find him out there, Dr. Hawking.
$C: The future will not forget Stephen Hawking.
$C: According to us in the states, Stephen Hawking died tomorrow. That's theoretical physics for you...

RIP 
$C: its sad to think

there are alot of americans right now...who hated stephen hawkins. not because of the character of who he is

but because they are so mired in their ignorance that they must defend against intellectualism at any cost

im afraid of what i might see if i peek in the_donald (aka KKK headquarters)
$C: I can't hold my tearsüò≠ :((((((((
$C: Time to lay down that burden, mate, and take a well deserved rest. Life dealt you a bad hand but even with your handicaps, you changed the world.


You were an inspiration to anyone with a disability. You proved that even with a terrible handicap, people like you can make a massive contribution to science.


RIP
$C: New Big Bang theory episode shall consist of Sheldon crashing the funeral!
$C: Oh, SHIT! Rest in peace man, you were a gift to mankind.
$C: "we are each free to believe what we want, and it is my view that the simplest explanation is there is no god. no one created the universe and no one directs our fate.

this leads me to a profound realization. there is probably no heaven, and no afterlife either. we have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that, i am extremely grateful."
$C: At the very least his passing on Pi Day is an absolutely perfect match for that man.
$C: RIP to one of the most influential, intelligent people to ever ~~walk~~ the earth. I'm honored to be alive at the time he was. 
$C: An inspiration to us all. He will be missed dearly.
$C: "Look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious."
$C:  This makes me incredibly sad, he left such an impression on me and the world if there is any thing I wish could keep going for eternity it would be his mind and we are left with a mix of curiosity and longing from his passing
$C: I have noticed that even people who claim everything is predetermined and that we can do nothing to change it, look before they cross the road.
$C: This really hurts my geeky heart. Too bad big bang theory can't do a tribute...or maybe they'll do a little piece and post it somewhere. Let's hope.  His theory was their namesake after all.  I always wanted him at my fantasy dinner of any people in history...him, Jesus , John Lennon and Elvis and tesla
$C: Quick, freeze his brain
$C: I want to unlike this post because it makes me very sad to hear about his passing. 
$C: It's good to know Hawking's PhD students are all outstanding in their field. They will pick up his mantle and continue on his work.

Nothing honors their former mentor more than to complete his life's ultimate ambition.

$C: I read his books when I was a kid. I admired his genius. I know one of his dreams was to fly to space. I'm disappointed he was never given that chance. [my favorite picture of a childhood hero.](https://i.imgur.com/UQwMM.jpg)
$C: More the reason to finish the book I started yesterday - Brief history of time, you should read it if you haven't.
$C: I just wish his thoughts could live on forever. 
$C: Dang, he did not live to see a person on Mars... goodbye, Mr. Hawking. You were great in Futurama.
$C: I find it funny all the well wishes and thank yous in this thread when he clearly didn‚Äôt believe in an afterlife. Gonna be rolling in his grave when he reads them. :)  

RIP you handsome genius.  Rest of y‚Äôall scientists, hop to it. He‚Äôs laid the foundation and then some, your turn. 
$C: I only wish we could have seen him get the Nobel for Hawking radiation, but perhaps he might work out if the black hole that is death has hair.

RIP
$C: I knew this dreaded day would come... And yet I was still not prepared... :( RIP Professor Hawking.
$C: He was indeed a great man. Looking at myself, I am lazy, judgemental. While he had a terminal illness, inability to walk and move freely without his electric chair and can't even talk. I'm never ever going to complain again.
$C: Out of all the famous people death news I've read, this was the only one I refused to believe.
$C: Good night sweet prince.
$C: The world just got a little dumber. Rest in piece. 
$C: Ahh, the world is in a better place after having him in it. RIP.
$C: I'm sure he would take solace in the fact that like the rest of us he would one day be part of a star again. 
$C: "We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special." -Stephen Hawking

Brilliant man. He has definitely inspired many (myself included) to truly see the beauty in modern physics. Without being able to walk or talk. RIP to an absolutely incredible man.
$C: Wow man, as many have said with the incurable disease and obvious health barriers he has had to live with, it still breaks my heart. This is really the first time I‚Äôve had tears running down my face over someone I‚Äôve never personally met... he was such a role model to me in so many ways... May your soul fly freely through the universe Mr. Hawking. You are at peace and your knowledge will be forever. 
$C: Would have been honoring if he had passed away on pi day 3/14
$C: Another great mind/person gone from us to soon. 

Binge watching his shows this weekend. 
$C: Man first Michael Jackson and now this. The greatest Legends of our decade start disappearing...soon we will be gone too i wonder how the world will be in a few hundred years. It's such a big deal in our small, current world...but in the end we are just a small part in a long time line. 
$C: Noooo I really looked up to that man he was a big inspiration to me
$C: I always imagined him dying getting launched into space.
$C: Shivers just ran down my spine. Thank you for the teaching me to be curious. 
$C: Rest In Peace. Truly brilliant man, and it is so sad to hear the news. Many will learn from him, as he inspired lots around the globe. 
$C: The man went above and beyond making the world a better place. It is sad to hear of his passing, but he will continue to inspire for generations. 
$C: He's with the stars now.
$C: 1970 Singularities in gravitational collapse
1971-72 Black hole mechanics
1974-75 How black holes can vanish
1982 How galaxies might arise
1983 Wave function of the universe
$C: Rest In Peace. If we invent time travel I will come back and attend your funeral in person.
$C: His name was Hope Stephen Hawkins. Many looked at him when they fall and stand to walk again.
$C: Not just a man standing on the shoulders of giants; he became one of those very same giants.
$C: Damn, this came out of nowhere for me.
$C: Even though he was 76 and his illness could have done him off years ago, it will always feel like it was too soon for it to be his time.
$C: We‚Äôve lost a legendary man today, but all good things must come to an end. Surely some day someone will come along to fill in the void left by Hawking‚Äôs death. Hopefully even surpassing him in doing so. 
$C: A man on a wheelchair with a crippling disease did more than most people will accomplish in multiple lifetimes. RIP Stephen Hawking and may he explore the universe in the heavens.
$C: His death hits so hard at home for me because my mother passed away last July from ALS after being diagnosed in February the same year. I remember reading up more on Stephen Hawking's medical history and feeling confident my mom could perhaps outlive the amount of time the doctors predicted. That being said, Professor Hawking had contributed so much to the world and universe as he constantly pushed the boundaries of humankind. And that's why even though he might not be here anymore, he's still very much alive and his legacy will live on for decades or even centuries to come. 
$C: Rest in peace. We will always cherish everything you did for us.
$C: This just broke and I'm really taking this hard. As people across the world react to mere celebrities dying, Stephen Hawking passing should be mourned astronomically higher than anyone else. I considered him as the smartest human on the planet. 

It is hard to see someone like him pass, but I only hope that humanity will build upon his intellect rather than revert to the idolatry of TV, movie and music personas passing. 
$C: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge."

"Life would be tragic if it weren't funny."

-Stephen Hawking

His words speak volumes.

$C: Nooooooooooooooooo... ok
$C: RIP Stephen Hawking, I will always remember you as a personal inspiration and history will remember you as the great man you were, one that accomplished so much, inspired so many and overcome every obstacle that life presented.
$C: I knew something happened when subs started dropping Hawking quotes all over. Had to check here and was, yup, he‚Äôs gone. Pretty inspiring dude. 
$C: Stephen having lives in the UK and the oldest post I can find on his death was BBC from four hours ago (Central standard Time), and his official D.O.D. Is March 14, 2018, meaning he died sometime after midnight in his home; 7:30pm where I live ;-; 
(Fyi- as of this post it is around 4 am in the UK)
$C: One of the great achievers of our time and inspiration to all in the realm of science,may you rest in peace.
$C: Holy crap, I did not expect to see this headline today.
$C: A life well lived. Rest In Peace Stephen Hawking, you will always be remembered 
$C: Stephen hawking died the same day of the year Albert Einstein was born and the same day Pi is celebrated. Sort of fitting really. 
$C: Thank you for your time Dr Hawking. May you rest in peace.
$C: Rest In Peace. You have done so much and inspired so many. 
$C: I'm not crying, you're crying!
$C: Did anyone else assume he just existed outside of space and time? Man. So unexpected. Rest in the stars, sir.
$C: As far as I know,  his mind was intent on the progress of humanity. Have a good journey.
$C: Thank you for inventing gravity /s

Though on a serious note, I am saddened to hear the news. However, we should be happy that he was always to accomplish so much and to help our scientific understanding of the world. 
$C: I wonder what will be Sheldon's reaction.
$C: Well that was unexpected to say the least. 
$C: I‚Äôve noticed that all the comments threads here are pretty much the same throughout the thread.
$C: Of all the people in the world that I wished were immortal, he was one of the first. 
$C: Maybe a weird way to put it, but I've always considered Hawking to be the father of my brain. I grew up extremely sheltered from science, and Brief History of Time was hidden from my parents like a porno mag when I was younger. Because of him, I began to challenge everything around me.

Rest well, Stephen. 
$C: He will live on through his discoveries.
$C: Holy shit! I didn't know he was 76
$C: Rest In Peace Mr. Hawking, you will be sorely missed.
$C: Bummed that he is gone, but few in history got more out of a life that fate tried so hard to cut short. For lack of a more eloquent phrase, he was a badass.
$C: Holy shit. 

I'm a little too flabbergasted to really say anything else. 
$C: Do you think it‚Äôs possible if we kept his brain we could revive his consciousness one day?
$C: Well this made me sad
$C: Why bro? Scientists are supposed to live forever!
$C: Great Russia goes past their deadline and then does this 
$C: A surprise to be sure, but an unwelcome one
$C: "However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at." 

Truly an inspiration to us all. RIP
$C: Rest in peace Steven. You will be so missed.
$C: On Imperfection  
>‚ÄúNext time someone complains that you have made a mistake, tell him that may be a good thing. Because without imperfection, neither you nor I would exist.‚Äù  

Rest in Piece Stephen Hawking

$C: I don't know how to feel about this, I'm just shocked. I never really thought about Stephen hawking dying, now the idea of continuing my day like nothing happened seems awkward.

I just hope he rests in peace and that he'll always be remembered. He was loved and will continue to be loved.
$C: Whether you‚Äôre religious, an atheist, believer or non-believer I‚Äôd assume everyone could agree on the fact that consciousness is by far one of the most complicated and confusing aspects of science. We‚Äôve yet to fully grasp  the concept of death but I‚Äôd like to wish that this brilliant man‚Äôs mind is somewhere still out there, hopefully in a better place.
$C: An incredible voice for the disabled. What a beautiful, beautiful human being.
$C: Thank you for inspiring me, and millions of others around the world, to be curious about our universe and to believe in the power of science to answer what was previously thought to be unknowable. Rest in peace. 
$C: Free at last, and off to the center of the universe he goes!
$C: I was hoping he could stick around long enough for stem cells and/or gene therapy to cure him. I think he was close. 

Goodbye Lisa's robot friend.
$C: R.I.P Steven Hawking. One of the beste human and scientist that lived on this earth. I‚Äòm so sad an schocked. 
$C: Weird how I randomly thought about him yesterday and now this happened... Rest in peace Stephen
$C: RIP YOU Brilliant One!  We're s step dumber without you.
$C: Einstein born on Pi day

Hawking dies on Pi day

I guess we should have seen that from a mile away






$C: At least he is free from that prison that was his body. 
$C: Is this a serious report?

$C: That's a shame. I just watched his documentary too, and wondered to myself how he has stayed alive all these years with ALS. His legacy will live on for sure. 
$C: In the face of absolute despair, this man not only outlived, but also drastically outachieved his peers. What an outstanding inspiration. 
$C: Rest In Peace Mr Hawking.
$C: He always inspired me as a little kid and he never stopped being a hero of mine. RIP
$C: I'm sad that the man who gifted me a real interest in big picture science is gone; but I'm grateful to have recieved it. 

Farewell. 
$C: Stephen Hawking passed away the day before Pi Day when we contemplate the unceasing & circular. Let us carry on the cycle by standing on the shoulder of this giant to dream & explore further than ever before. The end of one life, one journey, is not the end of our story.
$C: It‚Äôs been a hell of a week, huh.

Lemon, it‚Äôs Wednesday.
$C: that‚Äôs not how i want to end my day really shocked. RIP Stephenüôå
$C: Rest in peace, Mr. Hawking.. Your mark on this world will last for generations, & we appreciate you so deeply for all your care and contributions.
$C: I‚Äôm still a young lad, and I haven‚Äôt gone through many deaths of people who‚Äôre significant to me. I‚Äôm sad now. He was an amazing man. 
$C: I feel bad upvoting this. 
$C: I always had a dream where I could meet him. RIP him and my dream. 
$C: One of my idols. Had a pretty big impact on the way I see and understand things because I sort of mentally inhaled his books in my teens. I admired him for his intellect, good writing and his character. I think all of that is now immortal. Thanks for everything. RIP man.  
$C: Good for him.

Guy deserves some rest. 
$C: "Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change."

Truly one of the most intelligent minds to ever have lived.
$C: Earlier tonight, I ate about 5 grams of magic mushrooms, a first for my experience. Arguments to be made about their potency.

I marvelled at the sunset, explored a Tool album in total awe, and sat blasted to my chair while full surround sound and a 4k version of Christopher Nolan's " Interstellar " took me on an intense exploration of space, time, and the humanity that fills these voids as the universe experiencing itself.

Upon returning to earth, I was met with this news. Strange how my night has unfolded.
$C: I had just been thinking ‚ÄúWhat if Stephen Hawking lives until he‚Äôs 90‚Äù about two days ago. I‚Äôm sad to see him go.
$C: Death is as much a black hole as the real thing. I wouldn't argue enough to predict what comes out the other end. This or that. 

Naive as it may seem, I do wonder if he's found something. Or nothing. Either way I bet the discovery would be enough for this man to shrug off death. And ask more questions. And test more theories. 

Rest in peace, Professor. 
$C: Press F to pay respects
$C: Rest in peace, Mr. Hawking.
$C: This is crazy. If anybody was going to crack the code on living for forever I just knew it was going to be him. RIP. Legend 
$C: Holy shit, I don't even think about him dying.

RIP, we lost one of the greatest minds in history
$C: As someone who deals with memorabilia, my work gets so busy after someone of note dies. Now countless people are going to want something from him it‚Äôs almost sickening. I‚Äôve come to realize that people usually tend to not care about ‚Äúcelebrities‚Äù until they‚Äôre dead. I will post a picture of every item I get from this man in my job. And I don‚Äôt doubt that I‚Äôll get at least 3 items by Friday. 
$C: What a wonderful person. 
$C: Am I the only one concerned for Sheldon? 

I mean I‚Äôm super bummed. I‚Äôm so shocked. I really thought he‚Äôd live on forever. He‚Äôd invent something to keep his brain alive. 
$C: Press F to pay respects.
$C: Guess it was only a matter of time...
$C: I can‚Äôt believe it, I read the headline and I couldn‚Äôt process it. It was hard to remember he was even mortal, I imagined him as an immutable force of nature in the scientific world I can‚Äôt believe he can‚Äôt contribute to it anymore. Rest In Peace Mr. Hawking.
$C: Now he has finally found for himself whether or not God really exists.
$C: Damn, this is gunna take some getting used to. I know he was dying but I just didn't really think about him being gone.
$C: ahh.. dang.  Normally I don't care if people die due to the fact they have little impact in my life.  This guy impacted everyone in some form.  Sad day for science.
$C: R.I.P Stephen, thank you for your contributions 
$C: my man hawking, read about you when i was so young and didnt understand jack but you left loving everything about space 
$C: Didn‚Äôt feel like it was possible for him to die...  RIP
$C: Did anyone else happen to realize that he died on Pi Day (march 14th) ? Just something that caught my curiosity
$C: The world won't ever be the same with him. One of the last truly defining individuals of the 20th century
$C: He lived a good life; the man was supposed to die before he was 30. He accomplished great things in his lifetime and he will forever be remembered as one of the most intelligent human beings to have ever existed. RIP.
$C: The most stunning death of 2018 so far, despite being one of the more predictable deaths forecasted.
$C: May the Schwartz be with him
$C: That's crazy, may he RIP
$C: I wonder if he finally finished doing everything he had to do 
$C: Growing old means that those who you love, who inspire you, and look up to, pass away.
$C: I assume this happened because the universe decided he was too close to figuring it out.
$C: A great mind just left us. Rest in peace, professor.
$C: He is finally free to explore the stars. 
Rest In Peace, and god bless you sir. 
$C: Godspeed to whatever is next and may it benefit from you as much as we have. Your insights will be truly missed.
$C: I‚Äôm at a loss for words. 

Rest In Peace Stephen Hawking, you were a fine man.
$C: Physics midterm tomorrow...this isn't a good sign. Rest in peace to a true genius of our time.
$C: RIP.  So sad.  Beautiful mind.
$C: Interesting that he passed on pi day.
$C: I wonder if his brain be donated for science like Einstein.
$C: Shocked, but not so at the same time knowing how long he lived given his prognosis.

Shame I‚Äôll never get to debate my fluid theory with him.
$C: There is a void in the universe now that he's gone :(
$C: Like everything in this world will be overshadowed by this news
$C: "We once thought we were at the centre of the Universe; then we thought the sun was. Eventually we realised we were just on the edge if one of billions of galaxies. Soon we may have to humbly accept that our 3D universe is just one of infinite multidimensional universes"   - Stephen Hawking
$C: This is a death that hits me right in the feels. He inspired so many people with his work in physics and cosmology. Rest in peace, Stephen Hawking.
$C: Man we seriously lost a HUGE human being. Rolling a J for a real one.
$C: A beacon of light in this dark world has died. It is our job to fill in this void with love and to fight off the bringers of hate with kindness. Fly safe Stephen Hawking through the eternal void. We love you and you will be missed.

Love forever, 
Grayski
$C: Did not expect to read this so soon.

You will be missed 
$C: Really sad, didn't even know he was sick.
$C: Wow what the hell, I was just about to sleep and check Reddit and see this. Now I'm shook 
$C: He is currently having a very sobering paradigm shift as he meets his creator. Sad. 
$C: This is on par with Einstein's passing. 
$C: RIP. I will never forget reading 'A Brief History of Time' and how it differently it made me see the world. Thank you for everything. 
$C: On a public note:Human Knowledge of our Universe has suffered today.

On a personal note having met Prof Hawking."We have lost our universes R2D2"...RIP Dr. Hawking
$C: Died on March 14, the same day Albert Einstein was born and pi day.
Died aged 76, the same age Albert Einstein Died.


coincidence?!?!?!?!?
$C: And we are so close to photographing a black hole :( RIP.
$C: Lately his ideas were out there.  
$C: I think all of us saw this coming but... I don't think any of us were ready for it. He was an amazing human being and will absolutely go down in history as one of the greatest minds ever.
$C: Just living to 76 with his condition is amazing. On top of that even with these obstacles he was still able to have such an impact on the world! Definitely an inspiration and shining example that no matter what cards you‚Äôre dealt, you can still accomplish whatever you set you‚Äôre mind to with enough dedication and drive. RIP!  
$C: Shit, I feel like Betty White will come next and then Clint Eastwood.  
$C: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!! :( :( :( . I started to cry, and Then when I was asked who Stephen Hawking was, I cried harder.
$C: This man basically cheated death for 5 decades. I‚Äôm actually shocked this happened. RIP.
$C: I hope Trump shuts the fuck up and doesn't say something stupid about this.
$C: One of the first ¬´¬†celebrity deaths¬†¬ª that properly affected me. I have nothing but admiration for this amazing man, I hope history will make justice to his legacy. May you rest in peace Stephen.
$C: Press F to pay respects.
$C: I hope to science that Trump doesn't tweet about his death. It would just piss me off.
$C: Man, that's the last thing i was expecting to happened right now. So sad... Rest in peace Mr. Hawking
$C: Wow this hits me hard. RIP Mr. Hawking.
$C: With the world seeming dumber than ever lately, it's scary to lose someone as brilliant as Stephen Hawking. 
$C: I'm sad. RIP Mr. Hawking
$C: What happens now? 
$C: Now we‚Äôll never figure out the Grand Unified Theory. We‚Äôre just gonna float around forever, never knowing what it was all about.
$C: Rest In Peace Mr. Hawking.
$C: RIP. His chair is dope
$C: Hawking passed away on 3/14, Pi Day. Which is Einstein's birthday. Both Hawking and Einstein lived to be 76.

What a beautiful world we live in.
$C: This is one of the few deaths of an iconic figure in the last few years that has really hit me hard. The admiration I had for this man was second to none, he will be missed.  I can only hope the work he has done will inspire others to push the Limits of scientific discovery.  
$C: I'm shocked, i thought it was some troll post until i checked the news. Even though his physical condition, he did what most of us wouldnt ever be able to do. Much respect for this man. We will never forget you. RIP
$C: Man was a Legend, hope he finds peace up there with Einstein and Tesla
$C: This guy will be sorely missed, and with damn good reason.

Rest in physics, Mr. Hawking. You've been damn great.
$C: I'm so glad that it was a peaceful, natural death, but I was never prepared for him to pass away. :( 
$C: Wait, he's not immortal? 
$C: "I wanted to see your utopia. But now I see it's more of a fruitopia." https://youtu.be/OH8s4N15zdg
$C: This man takes all my respects...

F
$C: Good luck in your next adventure Mr. Hawking.  I hope you find the answers to the universe.
$C: This is truly a very tragic event in the scientific community. I only hope that hawking's family take his passing well, and that he did not die in pain.
$C: ‚ÄúRemember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet.  Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist.    Be curious.  And however difficult life may see, there is always something you can do and succeed at.  It matters that you don‚Äôt just give up.‚Äù

-Stephen Hawking

RIP to a scientist who perservered through so much and inspired so many.
$C: Much respect and love for this man. RIP.
$C: This is like a great person in Civ dying:(
$C: One of the giants of our modern age. He will be remember as an amazing physicist  and role model to anyone who seeks to overcome adversity. 
$C: right before pi day too :(
$C: There's now a black hole in science and in our hearts. Rest in peace Mr. Hawking
$C: There are few moments in mankind's history that we needed a man like this to hold out a few years longer. This is tragic, but we should all be grateful for living in the era that a once in a lifetime brain existed on this Earth.
$C: Pi day will forever make us cry now.

What makes it worse is with a guy like Stephen Hawking you will never know what was on his mind when he passed.

Maybe he discovered new truths about our universe that we've all overlooked. Maybe he thought of new theories for black holes. Or maybe he was just thinking about his loved ones and thankful for his life & all the time he had to do what he wanted before it ended.
$C: Passing away on Pi Day seems fitting, RIP
$C: Is it bad that I thought that this post was another one of those ‚ÄúJackie Chan has passed by a...‚Äù posts? I never expected him to die so suddenly :,(

RIP Mr. Hawkings 
$C: When I'm older it's going to be amazing to kids that I was alive at the same time as this important historical figure. 
$C: I can only hope that he's attending his own time-travel party now/again...
$C: Feels like knowledge has died
$C: He will now believe in the existence of God. RIP stephen. 
$C: Thank you for helping advance humankind. Always appreciated your humbleness. You are part of the cosmos sir and will always be remembered in the best light as one of our very best. 
$C: It's feels like such a big blow to mankind damn.
$C: Damn this hits like a truck. Into the universe and A Brief History of Time got me into physics in high school and inspired me to become a physicist. That he'd be gone one day just like that never occurred to me. RIP. 
$C: Maybe if we downvote these to oblivion, it won't be true :/ Works for political posts, right?
$C: RIP. He was such a great man. I remember he narrated (maybe even made) a show talking about life on different planets and that got me interested in biochem and chemistry, and thats exactly what I'm doing now. He was a genius and its very sad that he's gone.
$C: Albert Einstein born March 14  
Stephen Hawking died March 14
$C: I wasn't over Craig Mack yet and now my boy Hawkings.... 
$C: ‚ÄúIntelligence is the ability to adapt to change‚Äù
$C: He was an institution unto himself, THE absolute unit. Rip
$C: He lasted a lot longer with motor neuron disease that anyone thought was possible .  RIP Stephen Hawking.
$C: He died on just a day before Pi Day... :(
$C: It was going to happen eventually.
$C: "The universe in a nutshell" was one of the first books I read on my own.

It contained a formula for black holes. My 12yo me was punching numbers in there. I had no idea what I was doing but I felt like a rockstar "calculating black holes".

RIP Mr. Hawking, you will be missed! 
$C: He died on Pi day, what an icon 
$C: He died in the pi day... What a loss. RIP Professor.
$C: Thank you for putting hope in many people's lives Stephen. You shattered the limits of a disablility and went beyond that. Ypu are an inspiration. Thank you for all your hard work. RIP
$C: this man has inspired me so much. RIP
$C: His death depressed the hell out of me.  
Today's the 1st anniversary of my grandfather's death who was a famous Chinese physicist, PI day (3/14) in Europe, and Einstein's birthday.  How could such a coincidence happen??
$C: [deleted]
$C: Sad to think Ive never heard his natural voice...
$C: Will he be buried with his wheelchair? Seems as though he‚Äôd want it that way.  RIP in peace Mr. Hawkins!!
$C: Wow I'm shocked, but I know he was sick for a long time. May he find peace in the vast universe.
$C: RIP. What a great man he was.
$C: I look at the world we live in so differently thanks to this man. 
Currently I am on my second reading of The Grand Design, the first book I ever read of his was given to me by a person who I worked with that thought I might enjoy it and she was correct.

‚ÄúWe each exist for but a short time‚Äù is not true for you.
$C: Press F to pay respects. 
$C: His views on AI are much more chilling now that he‚Äôs....gone. 
$C: ‚ÄúThe reason we say humans have free will is because we can't predict what they will do.‚Äù‚ù§Ô∏èR I P brilliant, brilliant man..‚ù§Ô∏è
$C: Damn. I will remember this day. He‚Äôs a legend that will be read about for generations to come.
$C: There are babies being born right this minute that are living in a world without Steven Hawking. 

And one day, there will be babies born living in a world without Neil Degrasse Tyson. 

What I'm trying to say is... There will always be a brilliant man, in every generation, to guide the minds of children and men towards advancements in science and its understanding. 

But the cosmic dust of Steven Hawking will always be there. The total amount of energy in a closed system cannot be created nor destroyed, after all.
$C: This hit me hard in the feels. Rest In Peace.
$C: Damn and here I thought he would have already transferred his consciousness to a super computer or something so he would never "die".
$C: Wow, this was definitely not expected. 
$C: So long and thanks for all the science.
$C: 14 march Einstein was born and Stephen died

RIP 
$C: Celebrity deaths don't usually effect me but this one has.  The work he did on our understanding of the universe is incredibe.  RIP 1942-2018.
$C: An incredible human being. Someone who's quest for knowledge is something we should all aspire to.
$C: He made it to Pi Day...

Rest in Peace Steven Hawking.
$C: I honestly didn‚Äôt expect him to die yet. But in the end he achieved some great things in his life.
$C: Thanks for being an inspiration. You will be remembered. 
$C: Rest in peace, Stephen. You were always a source of inspiration and admiration for many others, myself included.
$C: RIP Mr. Hawking. 

Thank you for everything you've done!
$C: Sheldon is going to be heartbroken 
$C: The world has lost a brilliant mind today. I hope he is having a good time up there with Newton and Einstein. 

People may forget him, but history won't. My heart goes out to his family.
$C: They say that we all stand on the shoulders of giants.  They guys that follow after Hawking will need high altitude training.
$C: He just became more powerful than we could ever imagine. RIP Mr Hawking. 
$C: This has to be, without a doubt, the worst article ever written in the history of media. His Big Bang theory spot was mentioned as well as religious beliefs without mentioning anything he ever actually worked on besides mentioning his book was a best seller. Fuck this news, fuck this article, fuck the author. 
$C: This is shocking news. I guess it shouldn't be given his life circumstances. It never occurred to me that he was old, and could go at any time. He seemed almost immortal. 
$C: The world has lost a brilliant man.  May his wisdom guide us to a better future.
$C: It's strange that for all of his physical short comings, and the terminal illness he was suffering from, I never imagined him dying. It's the same with Robin Williams, I thought he'd be one of the last people to commit suicide. But then again, we never truly know someone, or their pain.

I hope that wherever you are Stephen, whatever shape, or form you have taken after shedding your shell, I hope you are dancing, running, jumping, twirling, and just having a gay old time good sir!
$C: This man is gonna be in the history books. Truly an inspiring icon. I‚Äôve never read the ‚ÄúBrief History of Time‚Äù book, but now I will.

RIP Dr. Hawking
$C: We just lost one of the greatest minds of our time... RIP
$C: he may have passed on but as long as we say his name, he never truly dies.
$C: Press F to pay respect.
$C: What a great man <3 the world will miss you.
$C: Can anyone here summarize his actual achievements/research? I know him mainly as a "pop scientist" and I feel many here are just making blanket statements like "Wow what a guy! RIP!" 


$C:  I didn't realize he was anywhere near that old. RIP. 
$C: What an incredible man. He was a fighter, and a brilliant mind, RIP
$C: "Although I cannot move and I have to speak through a computer, in my mind I am free."

Farewell Professor Hawking.
$C: Damnüò± RIP to a great individual! üò∞
$C: Really unexpected honestly. I think we‚Äôve all been pummeled with celebrities dying at various ages to even consider this.
$C: Ironically, while he was known for surviving ALS far beyond any sense of the disease, it's only now we can learn what he had.  I suspect he'd see the intrigue, and would be as curious as the rest of us. 
$C: My favorite bit of information regarding Stephen Hawking...

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/28/stephen-hawking-said-to-frequent-sex-club_n_1307625.html
$C: This man was one of the greatest humans to ever live, and he never hurt a single person to reach that greatness.

It would be a sick joke if mankind goes extinct after everything he helped us learn about the universe. 
$C: RIP Stephen Hawking.  The only books I've ever read about theoretical physics are written by him. He really had a way of explaining things that shouldn't be comprehensible. I'm passing on the passion to my 3 kids
$C: Hawking will be remembered as the Einstein of our generation. He changed the way we think about the fabric of reality. I don't think many people can make that claim. Absolutely a huge loss. 
$C: What an awesome guy who really didn't lack for finding his potential and really contributed to the world. Cheers to him, he is a pride to humanityüçª
$C: Wow... this hit me hard. RIP.
$C: Physically gone but never gone in our hearts. Rest in peace to a brilliant man who lived strong with an incurable disease for 55 years. 
$C: Nooooooooooooooooooooooo - in robot voice
$C: What a remarkable and genius man. He will be missed. Though he had come over so many obstacles over his lifetime as far as disabilities go and all the challenges he had to face daily he still contributed so much to society and science. He will be truly missed. Rest in peace friend, your work here is finally done. Rest easy. We truly lost an amazing person. One of the most genius men we had. This is a huge blow, but i hope we can push forward and carry out his legacy and finish whatever he left unfinished 
$C: Today we lost one of the good ones :(
$C: RIP Stephen Hawking 1942-2018. From stardust we came and stardust will we become. May he sleep in the stars.
$C: Will they preserve his brain?
$C: Wow. RIP. The world thanks you for your brilliant mind Mr Hawking. 
$C: There will be no need to print any obituary columns for his demise. Time travelers will know.
$C: My heart. üò≠
There are few humans whose existence has brought me comfort simply in knowing their mind shared the same tiny space of the cosmos. This man was a miracle if ever there was such a thing.
$C: Well crap, I had hoped to meet him someday.
$C: I wonder what will happen to his speech box, which iconically became his ‚Äúvoice‚Äù. 
$C: I really can't believe this actually. Like it's something I just never expected to happen. He's always working on projects, or speaking to the public. I just. I'm not sure.
Mortality sucks. 
$C: Rest in peace you American Hero. 
$C: Rest In Peace Stephen Hawking. 

Your countless intellectual advancements will forever be emblazoned in your wake. You will be remembered for not only your intelligence, but for your determination and spirit in life. You taught us all to not look at our feet, but at the stars.

RIP
$C: This is one of those deaths I feel like we really lost someone as a society.
$C: Damn, this was really sudden. What a shame, he was a great man. He had one hell of a life though and accomplished some seriously incredible things most of us can only dream of doing, especially considering the illness he had to fight for so long and never gave up. Full respect to this man, he truly deserves it.

Rest in Peace, Stephen Hawking. You will be missed, but never forgotten.
$C: NONONO NOOOOO NOOOOO!!!!! His amazing mind! D': I wanted to know more discoveries about the universe
$C: Very sad to see him go. One of the most brilliant minds of our time, who overcame extreme physical adversity in order to learn and teach. Truly one of the most unique and gifted humans to have lived.
$C: RIP. May you rest with the stars. 
$C: May his intellect live forever 
$C: Hundreds of years from now, people will remember him. What a person.
$C: NONONO NOOOOO NOOOOO!!!!! His amazing mind! D': I wanted to know more discoveries about the universe
$C: "Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change." What a brilliant man.. RIP
$C: A true scientific legend. Rest In Peace.
$C: Hope he lives on in the world as a renowned scientist and his family grieves properly. It feels like something is missing now though.
$C: Goodbye man, we'll continue to figure things out here. Good luck wherever you're going, and thank you for your discoveries and help. You've made so many new scientists already. Keep exploring wherever you go next. Thank you and rest in peace.
$C: Hawking had a great mind, may he soar like the eagle high above.
$C: What an incredible person he was, his legacy will live on and inspire many. May he rest peacefully 
$C: A very humbling man who showed everyone what can truly be accomplished in the face of adversity. It feels like a close friend has died. He will be remembered for generations to come.
$C: Move into the annals of the greatest, Mr. Hawking. Godspeed.
$C: So much respect for this man.. I'm in tears right now and can barely type.
$C: awww, he died on pi day 
$C: Now no one will care about Craig Mack passing! :(
$C: It's worth checking out the documentary "A Brief History of Time", made by the genius filmmaker Erroll Morris. It's an interesting look into his life as well as a masterpiece of a film.
$C: An honorable man and a great scientist. RIP sir.
$C: Prepare for the memes
$C: He will always have a special place in our heart. Rest in piece. No need to talk about other things, his willing to live alone is a miracle.
$C: Sincerely was not expecting this, hope he rests in peace, absolute legend both in media and science.
$C: Rest in piece my dude.
$C: NONONO NOOOOO NOOOOO!!!!! His amazing mind! D': I wanted to know more discoveries about the universe
$C: As a true scientist, he left this world on 3.14. Godspeed sir...
$C: My very first book on the universe stephen hawkings. Rip. 
$C: Wow RIP. Truly one of the greatest scientists pushing the envelope of his fields 
$C: He does not believe in an afterlife, but the nothingness he does believe in would be much easier than the pain and suffering he has had to go through. Praying for his family during this time of grief.
$C: Rest For Eternity Stephen Hawking. May all the mysteries of the universe finally been answered for you. You are with the real stars now.
$C: We just have the Queen and Betty White now.
$C: It really feels quite odd to hear about his death. He became a such a wildly recognizable person, even to normal people, that he felt more like a character than an actual human being, at least in the public's perception.
$C: RiIP Mr Hawkins. Thank you for all that you gave us. 
$C: He's rolled on to the other side. He will be missed.
$C: Rip a brilliant mind lost.
$C: For someone who was given 2 years to live in 1964, he's given us several lifetimes worth of knowledge. I hope that his legacy will carry on well into the future.

Like stopping AI from becoming to advanced. He warned us about that! 
$C: Humanity feals a little less complete today.
$C: He passed away on the Pi day.
Rest in Peace!
$C: I wonder how all those asshole time travelers that didn‚Äôt show up to his party feel now?
$C: I see a lot of love and a lot of respect for this man here. I hope this is indicative of the reception of his death, a celebration of his life and a resurgence (if any were needed) of his ideals and his theories. If anyone has ever earned it through hard work and dedication it's him. 
$C: Thanks for all the laughs.
$C: One of the things that I‚Äôm always fascinated about by Professor Hawking is that he has probably set the record in the medical field for the longest time living with MND from his diagnosis in 1963 to his death today (approximately 55 years). 

And I find it absolutely extraordinary that he still travelled across the world and held high tenures in the academic field, teaching us about the universe and the laws of physics and how we as a species maintain a relationship with it.

Today is a sad day, but I feel it should also be a day to celebrate his wonderful achievements and his hard work and determination.

Vale Stephen Hawking, 1942-2018
$C: My list of people I've wanted to meet in person just got shorter :(

Rest easy Mr. Hawking.
$C: It's so much of a shame when someone with this much brainpower and knowledge passes away. All of it just dies with them.
$C: It‚Äôs because he‚Äôs so influential in every day theory and his legacy is so large, that it will likely ever occur that it matters that he‚Äôs dead. He was an incredible human being that has done more good for this world than the vast majority will ever be able to say. I‚Äôm glad to say I lived in the era where Stephen Hawking was alive.
$C: He was an incredibly rational person I love this from the article:  
  
> Hawking once described belief in a God who intervenes in the universe "to make sure the good guys win or get rewarded in the next life" as wishful thinking.

> "But one can't help asking the question: Why does the universe exist?" he said in 1991.

> "I don't know an operational way to give the question or the answer, if there is one, a meaning. But it bothers me."  
  
I think that it's something he doesn't outright dismiss "God". He says it as wishful thinking, but it bothered him that the universe is just *here*. Where *exactly* did the universe come from? There has to be an origin. Saying that it bothers him means that he probably spent some time trying to figure it out. It's a fascinating topic, this creation of the universe.
$C: RIP Professor Hawking & someone go back sure Stan Lee is doing alright 
$C: He have got harrased in this year by people that think they are better than others. Probably this costed him more than expected.
$C: The average IQ of the earth just dropped faster than light falls into a black hole
$C: May us never forget when he slayed Einstein in one of the greatest rap battles of history. Farewell to one of the greatest minds ever given to this planet. 

 https://youtu.be/zn7-fVtT16k
$C: Stephen Hawking has passed away! He‚Äôs passed away! He‚Äôs gone! He‚Äôs dead! He‚Äôs fine! He sends his love!
$C: You know there is a old saying ‚Äú the greatest wisdom the oldest men have is that they also must die‚Äù I loved the contributions he made to physics and understanding of vastness of our universe, the appearances he made on the Simpsons and the fact that he did all of this fighting a disease that should have killed him years ago. Goodbye Professor 
$C: "I'm not afraid of death, but I'm in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first." -Stephen Hawking 
$C: This is so sad, definitely one of the greats that will go down in history. Rest in peace, Stephen Hawking. 
$C: for the hand that he was dealt 76 is pretty good. hoping to see some of final papers and notes trickle out in the next few weeks
$C: I first came to learn about Stephen Hawking in the Dexter's Lab episode where he was the Willy Wonka of science. I loved that episode. He made such an impact in the science world and he leaves a legacy behind. RIP.
$C: Damn, he died on Pi Day
$C: He died on Pi Day and on the birthday of Einstein. The universe was aware of his existence and wanted him to go out rightfully so. 

RIP Stephen Hawking 
$C: He seemed like a genuinely nice man. Surviving for over 50 years with ALS is incredible, along with all of his other achievements in his lifetime. Proud to be able to say I coexisted with him. RIP Mr. Hawking 
$C: The man is a physical representation of the words "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade."
$C: Such an awesome dude,loved watching his shows on discovery channel,may his soul rest in peace
$C: We lost a great mind today...
$C: Oh wow. That sucks hard. 

RIP professor Hawking
$C: First Billy now Stephen Hawking, FeelsBadMan
$C: 'I have noticed even people who claim everything is predestined, and that we can do nothing to change it, look before they cross the road.' ~Stephen Hawking.

Truly, he forged his own path, and the world was the better for it.
$C: "Nothing cannot exist forever." 

-Stephen Hawking 
$C: Rest in peace Stephen, the world will miss you
$C: Oh wow that‚Äôs so sad.. he may be dead but his legacy will live on for a very very very long time
$C: I mean he held together well, at the age of 22 Stephen Hawking was given only a few years to live after being diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease (ALS). He lived to 76 which was much more than he was expected to live to. RIP Stephen Hawking
 

$C: Rest in peace my friend!
$C: Now the the painful death for me would be Stan Lee and GRRM.

Those especially with Stan since he is over 90 but that man made my childhood
$C: I'm really saddened by this news.
$C: Rest in Peace Stephen Hawking, you were one of the greatest physicists to ever live and will go down in the halls of science with Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton
$C: Rest in peace Mr. Hawking.
$C: I just happened to walk past this man in London while visiting, and I always regretted not telling him how much he made me think about my place in the universe. He did so much to inspire the world. 
$C: Good for him.  I always felt bad for the dude that he had to live like that and maybe better off now.  He contributed a lot to the world and got to feel good about that.
$C: >His passing has left an intellectual vacuum in his wake. But it's not empty. Think of it as a kind of vacuum energy permeating the fabric of spacetime that defies measure. Stephen Hawking, RIP 1942-2018.

Neil Degrasse Tyson 

Vacuum... Ener... What the hell man.
$C: RIP to a man that did not let what others perceive as a disability stop him from being one of the brightest minds in perhaps history. It‚Äôs funny how a man we never personally knew, had such a profound way on the things we learned, especially when it came to scientific studies. Truly one-of-a-kind person.


We have truly lost a wonderful being
$C: A great man died today. A man who inspired millions and brought forward an understanding of science to many more. His discoveries pushed the human race into a new age of understanding. May he be remembered for all time for his achievements.
$C: Wait, I had assumed he was immortal.
$C: Legend doesn't describe him enough.

 Thank you.
$C: Doesn‚Äôt feel real, I always imagined him living forever, I love space and science and it was this man who inspired me. 
$C: Man its pretty crazy hawking was always in this ageless area in my minds eye.... rip
$C: A friend sent me a message that he died. Must of meant something to him. 
$C: Press F to pay respects.
$C: RIP to a great mind, such a loss.

[This](http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/126314-i-dont-want-to-live-on-this-planet-anymore) is probably what he was thinking watching anti-intellectualism on the rise with climate change deniers, flat earth societies, and anti-vax folks (even though [research](https://www.autismspeaks.org/science/science-news/new-meta-analysis-confirms-no-association-between-vaccines-and-autism)  continues to find no link between vaccines and developing ASD. 
$C: He was free in his mind. RIP.
$C: If human life were long enough to find the ultimate theory, everything would have been solved by previous generations. Nothing would be left to be discovered.
$C: Let's have time traveling parties and see if joins.
$C: Stephen Hawking showed us for 76 years that no matter what the world throws at you, you can overcome it. RIP Professor Hawking, I hope the universe is beautiful from up there. 
$C: Rest In Peace. Incredibly sad. 
$C: I love the concept that in whatever afterlife there is, not heaven, of course, but some sort of beyond not in the description of the church that Billy Graham and Steven hawking are talking right now, Billy is probably disappointed. 
$C: Wow wasn't expecting this when I woke up. RIP 
$C: Did they keep his brain?
$C: "The career of a great man remains an enduring monument of human energy. The man dies and disappears, but his thoughts and acts survive, and leave an indelible stamp upon his race." - Samuel Smiles.

It's crazy I honestly never imagined him dying.
$C: Well that fucking sucks.
$C: "We are like butterflies who flutter for a day and think it is forever."

- Carl Sagan
$C: One death of a man, one giant loss to all of mankind.  
$C: He is one of the greatest cosmologists ever lived, and a person I admire deeply. Rest in Peace Mr Hawkings.
$C: Fuck. Rest easy, Dr Hawking. 
$C: Weep with me fellow geniuses, our brother will never be able to watch Rick and Morty again. 
$C: An immortal mind in a mortal body. RIP 
$C: I loved his lyrics in California Love... This guy knew how to party. 
$C: Hopefully, this spurs on scientists and companies to strive even further, I'd like yo tell myself that's what he would've wanted.
$C: "I have no idea. People who boast about their IQ are losers." 

 Incredible man who will not be forgotten. RIP. 
$C: I didn't even know he was sick
$C: Holy shit this sucks. This s must be what it was like when Einstein died
$C: The mind that contemplated the mysteries of the universe in greater detail than most of us can imagine has gone to join it.

RIP Professor Hawking
$C: Wasn‚Äôt ready for this today. He was an amazing mind
$C: [The current "Featured Stories" on the sidebar of his Obituary, on the BBC's website.](https://i.imgur.com/P4LnYby.jpg)

This just seems disrespectful from the BBC. 
$C: Humankind lost a very bright mind today. Hopefully we as a species will progress in a way that he would be impressed by.
$C: "I'm a supercomputer you're like a TI-82" RIP
$C: As a kid watching him talk about the universe and physics on TV inspired me to learn and read and become the scientist I am today. 

Thank you Stephen. 
$C: The man who shed light on the darkest corners of our universe. 
$C: ‚ÄúOne, remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Two, never give up work. Work gives you meaning and purpose, and life is empty without it. Three, if you are lucky enough to find love, remember it is there and don‚Äôt throw it away.‚Äù RIP
$C: What a shame, he seemed to be a pretty funny guy to hang out with.
$C: [removed]
$C: Damn, had to do a double take. Never really crossed my mind that he could die so suddenly, but it makes sense. We were truly lucky to have him for as long as we did. 
$C: He‚Äôs such a legend that he died in Pi Day!
$C: A man who was a forefront pioneer in quantum physics and the workings of outer space has left us today with a legacy we must uphold and continue to build on. Rest in peace Mr. Hawking, our civilization will never forget your great work. 

Edit: Grammar. 
$C: https://vocaroo.com/i/s12aEUCaUik3
$C: wow I had to look at 5 different posts to realize he really died
$C: Fuck. This news wouldn‚Äôt hit me nearly as hard 2 weeks ago. I just started reading one of his books and my respect for him was growing every day.
$C: What a shame to have lost him, but what a privilege to have had him as long as we did.

We'll miss you, Dr. Hawking.
$C: What a great life. Hopefully we get more people like him in our future.
$C: Do not stand at my grave and weep 
I am not there. I do not sleep. 
I am a thousand winds that blow. 
I am the diamond glints on snow. 
I am the sunlight on ripened grain. 
I am the gentle autumn rain. 
When you awaken in the morning's hush 
I am the swift uplifting rush 
Of quiet birds in circled flight. 
I am the soft stars that shine at night. 
Do not stand at my grave and cry; 
I am not there. I did not die.

by Mary Elizabeth Frye
$C: Holy shit... a truly incredible man is now gone. Rest in peace.
$C: I'm gonna miss Steph and his fly ass whip. 
$C: Mankind just lost one of it's greatest minds. I feel heartbroken.
$C: Can someone send me a link to Hawkings work and clips of his humor?
$C: Damn this is a shame. R.I.P, he will certainly be missed.
$C: There's very few people who become legendary during their life, and fewer still who can keep that legendary status for the rest of their lives. He brought the cutting edge of physics within reach of the common man. It's sad to see him go. 
$C: He never got to go into space... üòî
$C: Sheldon must be devastated 
$C: When I was quite young, I remember sneaking into my mom's office.  She had a copy of "A Brief History of Time", and would sit it out and flip through for the illustrations, allowing myself to get sucked into one or another, imagining myself there.  Not much later, I saw this man sitting next to Einstein and Newton on my favorite TV show.  

He helped shape my early wonder with space and physics.  He imparted to me, as I'm sure he did countless others, an insatiable curiosity and thirst for understanding.  A sense that the impossible vastness was knowable.

Much more than most, this man helped carry the collective human endeavour of science a bit further, lighting it's way.  A towering intellect, a true giant.  Our generation's great mind.  

We never met, but I want to thank you.. May you rest with the stars that you loved so dear.
$C: Anyone remembers the story about him where his class was like given a few questions and he managed to complete all in a short time while his peers could only manage one or two at best? I‚Äôm trying to find that story now, but to no avail


Maybe I should look through his books again
$C: I just jumped from my bed when I read that title. I hope this turning point in history that is taking so many of the past generations' geniuses from us will in turn give us new intellectuals who'll help us think and ponder the solutions to the difficulties we face.
$C: Rest in peace, Stephen Hawking. 
$C: He has now evolved to a Q and as a Q he will enter the cartoon realm and visit Fry & the gang.

RIP 
$C: I like to think he is now with the other world renown minds of their times.
$C: ;(

$C: Stephen Hawking was born on 8 January 1942.
Galileo died on 8 January 1642.

Albert Einstein was born on 14 March 1879.
Stephen Hawking has died on 14 March 2018.

Unreal. 
$C: the real life Mr. House. i thought you could do it. 
$C: Say not in grief: "He is no more," but live in thankfulness that he was.
$C: The world has lost a true gem. RIP  
$C: Ad Astra, Professor Hawking!


Does anybody know if he made cryonics arrangements?
$C: RIP in peace homie.  
https://imgur.com/gallery/qZdPn67
$C: This man was able to achieve more in one day than most of us can achieve in an entire year, and more than some can achieve in an entire lifetime. I already miss him.
$C: I don't know if a heaven exists, but I hope Stephen is somewhere good and at peace.
$C: Ugh, I thought he was already dead...I hate it when this happens 
$C: So, none of his time traveling friends came to save him.
$C: The world got a little darker today.
$C: holy damn, sad to hear one of the greatest minds is gone rip
$C: One thing I will definitely always remember: "Stephen Hawking died on my 30th birthday." RIP
$C: Today we lost one of the great ones
$C: Damn must have been all the cigarettes he smoked
$C: if you want him to live on, just speak regularly and move your finger over your lips as you do
$C: Such a shame... I had all his records. 
$C: I wanted a photo with him :/
$C: I‚Äôll never forget when my grade 10 science teacher had lent my his novel the Universe in a Nutshell, it changed my life and outlook on life. 
$C: To anyone who has NOT read "A brief history of time" - you should really read it. And now is a good moment I suppose. It is a must read for every human being. 
$C: It's the Pi day today, what an amazing coincidence.. 
$C: Just remember that now he can stand tall and speak loud eternally.
$C: Another one of mankind's greatest minds again returns to the infinite ether it once came from.
$C: This is one of those death headlines where you stop and sit in silence for a moment.  Then likely spend the rest of the day watching relevant videos, paying what mental respects a stranger can.  RIP.
$C: "I believe the simplest explanation is, there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realization that there probably is no heaven and no afterlife either. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe and for that, I am extremely grateful."

- Stephen Hawking

$C: Dang, he was a truly remarkable man. May he rest in peace.
$C: We lost one of the brightest mind of human race. Rest in peace. I always looked up to you, filled with motivation and admiration. Hope you resolved all the Universe's mysteries now.
$C:  Noooooo! Saddest celebrity death. I will miss him like I miss Steve Irwin.
$C: This makes me so fucking sad.  I have cf and my whole life i have just struggled to make it mean something...to do something, but i can't get over the fact that I'm gonna die sooner than later.  This guy gets diagnosed with a shitty disease and fucking fights through it, lives through it, and makes discoveries while hes in a wheelchair.  what the hell is my excuse.  The world is a bit less bright right now...
$C: RIP he shared the belief that philosophy is bullshit and science should prevail
$C: Interesting thing to note, it's pi day today and the next pi day might be recognized as the day Stephen Hawking passed away
$C: It was the AI on his chair that got him. He tried to warn us.

In all seriousness, He was one of the first minds out there to actually prove some things about black holes, and showing that despite their surreal behavior, they still must obey the laws of physics like everything else.

He accomplished more sitting in a chair than the whole lot of us combined.
$C: Rest in Peace..He will be immortalized in human history. 
$C: He was a tough man, who braved through life and achieved great heights in a way only few people have. May his soul rest in peace.
$C: For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals
Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination
We learned to talk
$C: Thank you great master. You were one of the best of our species. 
$C: Rest in peace to a legend.

You will be missed Stephen, and your life will never be forgotten.
$C: His brief history of time was longer than anyone could have expected.
Thanks for being an inspiration Mr.Hawking


$C: Rest in peace, to the man who warned us, the man that survived past when people thought he would die, and the man who was trying to use his knowledge for the greater good.
$C: I guess we'll never know how the universe works after all. Rip 
$C: RIP one of the most influential minds of our time
$C: When I read this news it took me a moment to process it. On the bright side he did live a much longer life than he was told by doctors. But that doesn't make this news easy. 
$C: RIP Hawkins, today we lost a very respectful clever guy, he will always be remembered.
$C: If you're going to live 50 years on borrowed time, there would be no better way to spend it than the way he did. Thanks for the knowledge, and the endless drive to learn more.

I've been holding off buying a large telescope for deep sky astrophotography and I think this news has just pushed me over the edge to do it.


$C: [A still more glorious dawn awaits,](https://youtu.be/zSgiXGELjbc)

not a sunrise, but a galaxy-rise.

A morning filled with a hundred billion suns;

the rising of the milky way.
$C: I wake up and see this. Damn. Rest in Peace, Mr. Hawking.
$C: Died on Einstein‚Äôs Birthday plus pi day
$C: At least his time wasn't so brief.
$C: He died at the same exact age as Albert Einstein. On the same exact day of the year. Woah. 
$C: One of the greatest minds of our time. I predict thousands show up to his funeral if it's public. The scientific community is without its beacon of light. Truly an epic man.
$C: An episode will come over this on Big Bang Theory. After all, Sheldon respected him so much.
$C: Future generations will see him as a gift to humanity. Despite his passing, he is one of the reasons why this is such an incredible time to be alive.
$C: I submit a request to name our first voyage into a black hole in his regard. 
$C: He did more than any of us living an average life 
$C: This is really sad. In a time where truth itself is being tested, a man who so embodied intellect and the pursuit of truth is now gone.
$C: I hope history won't ever forget this man. 
$C: It never happened to be a possibility to me that he'd die i just thought welp he's a famous scientist guess he lives forever.
$C: It's rare to feel so sad for the people you never seen or met personally but their thoughts and work have great significance in shaping our life. He was one of that guy.

RIP Stephen Hawking.
1942-2018 : A life truly lived.

p.s. Last time when it happened, it was demise of Chester. Damn. Why all my childhood stars leaving.. :'(
$C: He was an idol of mine,it makes me so sad rip steveüò¢üò¢üò¢
$C: Conspiracy theorists believed he was already dead lol
$C: Fair winds and following seas my friend.  
$C: Kinda fitting he died on pi day
$C: The beautiful mind of twentieth century. Professor Hawking, I know you aren't religious, but, Rest In Peace
$C: I think it was really special how Terry Pratchett was immortalised in code. Can we please allow the same thing for this wondrous professor in quantum computing. Please?

RIP to this guiding light and inspiration. You will be sorely missed. 
$C: Heroes get remembered, but chairs never die.
$C: A great loss to the tech world and  industry as a whole, we will always remember and appreciate you for your works.
$C: 103k upvotes in two hours? That‚Äôs really telling of how far reaching this man was. Rest In Peace. 
$C: We'll see you on the holodeck, professor

$C: May he Rest In Peace such a short life for such a brilliant mind
$C: Free at last : ) He is part of the universe now more than ever.
$C: My undergrad was at a school with a very prestigious physics program (suck it Berkeley, we beat you) and Steven Hawking would visit for lectures and what not. 

No lie, he ran my friend over with his chair
$C: What about all the weird sex stuff
$C: The mainstream media sometimes gave him a little too much credit, his alien colonization comments, but damn this guy talked through a damn computer and still was the most understandable person when he talked about stuff that nobody would understand otherwise. He was probably the smartest man alive, with a terrible disease and still had his sense of humor and never gave up. We will miss you Professor Hawking. o7
$C: "We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special."

-Stephen Hawking

I never even realised he was that old. His contribution will keep him immortal.

RIP.
$C: The day Albert Einstein was born, the Einstein of our time passed away, RIP
$C: RIP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJ7zbzJZsjs
$C: I don't know much about physics because I've never understood it so I never went too deep into Mr. Hawking's work but even then I find him to be one of the most inspirational persons. I really admire him for never giving up even with an illness that normally would have ended his life way sooner. And I also admire him for never losing his humour and for keeping his inner child. May he rest in peace.

Meanwhile on the Donald.
$C: Now I feel like I have to watch The Theory of Everything. Hadn't gotten to it. I think I might have to make the effort now. 
$C: Guys, why don't we all just watch Theory of Everything today to honor this great man? I think we should
$C: In a weird way, his work made me appreciate life here more than anything else has.

He was a gift.
$C: The world has lost a man that made the world a place where man has gained some understanding.
$C: He was one of the most loved cosmologists  of the word, we will miss him.  
R.I.P. 
$C: R.I.P The greatest scientist ever.

He will always be alive in our hearts.
$C: RIP you bloody legend! We lost a hero today :_(
$C: RIP. A great man have passed away.
$C: RIP one of the greatest minds of this generation. 
$C: Rest in Peace dear friend u will be truly missed u were my hero ....tyÔªø
$C: Sad that he‚Äôs gone. Absolutely brilliant man. But I can‚Äôt help to think that the time travelers came to snatch him up on Pi Day of all days
$C: I wish he could see this thead. I want him to know how much appreciated he is. 
$C: Rest In Peace genius of our time 
$C: [F] This is first time I've been sad in a while. RIP
$C: Honestly having a gut wrenching feeling i don't usually have when i read about celebrity deaths. Guess it's because of how much the man contributed to humanity every day.
$C: RIP. I was at Cambridge university walking around campus in December hoping I‚Äôd randomly run into him.  Alas, I did not, but i would recommend visiting Cambridge to anyone that hasn‚Äôt gone before, it‚Äôs a wonderful place. 
$C: I think he's just found a better dimension to live in 
$C: My Dad also died from MND (ALS if in America) last year. It's the cruelest way to go. 
$C: All we have to do, is keep talking
$C: Time for every person on social media to gush about how they're huge fans and follow his work
$C: RIP. I hope he died peacefully.
$C: Man this hurts. I watched him all the time as a kif. F.
$C: Hawking story.

I‚Äôve been to several of his lectures, and at the first one I went he had a prepared speech and slides etc, and then opened the floor to questions.
So I waited my turn patiently. It took time for him to compose answers, some of them were quite complex too. We‚Äôd sit and wait and then the answer would come.

So I asked my question, and then expanded the question with a ITTT?.

So we waited, and waited, and he was composing the answer for quite a long five minutes, and then he answered....  ‚ÄúNo‚Äù.

Jesus that was embarrassing. Everyone was falling about laughing. I‚Äôm told that he joked around like that at a lot of his lectures.

He was a man of the people had a good sense of humour, and that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm going to remember him.

Well, that and exposing Jeremy Hunt for the cunt that he is.
$C: I can't get over the fact that this person is gone forever. Death is scary.
$C: He was truly a great man
$C: People think I‚Äôm smart cuz I talk like a robot‚Ä¶
$C: So who's next smartest person in the earth? 
Please don't say is a computer. 
$C: The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge. -stephen hawking
$C: I'm young, healthy, and strong, and would gladly donate my body to save this man. For science!
$C: Honestly, I cried a little. 
$C: Sadly, I only knew him from Futurama & The Simpsons...
$C: I‚Äôm sort of in shock, but at the same time I‚Äôm not too surprised. Not sure what to feel.
$C: Stephen Hawking will find a way to send us a sign. 
$C: My science teacher, who i regarded as brilliant, in the past walked about how amazing one of his lectures was. She was lucky enough to hear him talk about black holes for 2 hours. Her face telling the story was starstruck. He made a huge impression on her a d her career i imagine.

She, and him, both inspired myself to do a lot. Loved his books and his persona in media. Amazing man, will be missed.
$C: I want to know his contributions. Tl:dr? Pls.
$C: I dont think any celebrity death has actually made me feel depressed even a little before. But this morning his death struck me hard. World has lost a great man and inspiring scientist.
 Its honestly amazing how he, not only lived a full life despite of his illness, but also managed to make incredible career in a field he must have loved. Hes a rolemodel for anyone who thinks they dont have a change in full filling their dreams.
$C: I was seriously not expecting this. Rest in peace Mr Hawking.
$C: Best Simpsons character ever!
$C: I wasn't expecting this to hit me so hard. I looked up to this man so much. RIP.
$C: Vau i had no idea id be do moved by he's death, history vill for sure never forget him. Rest in peace now, you did so much and  more even though you where sick which is so inspiring
$C: He was like a NASA space probe. Not meant to make it past the first decade, and he just kept on trucking for far longer than most would have thought.
$C: Oh that really does suck, I hope he went out peacefully. I also hope a new scientific gem arises in his place.
$C: He had a great sense of humor and a great mind. He really focused on his strengths and made the most of what he had. His disability probably contributed to his genius, not hurt it. 
$C: It was a good funeral. Bye 2018 see yall in 2068
$C: This man has done more in his one lifetime than I ever can even if I could time travel.
$C: His like will never be seen again. 
$C: Did we just lose the smartest man on earth or am i forgetting somebody?
$C: Wildly ironic that he died on pi day (unless he died before midnight in the uk)
$C: He had been running on low consumption mode for a while now
$C: You know the man was a legend when news of his death takes up every post on the front page.
Rest In Peace.
$C: Rest in peace Stephen.
$C: RIP... truly a great man
$C: Yeah it's 2 a.m where I live and I've had a few beers and im not motivated enough to do the detective work. I can believe that there may have been some criticism on the T_D but I find it hard to believe that they wished death upon him.
$C: This'll probably be buried, but hearing the news made me track down one of my [favorite stories](http://www.b3ta.com/questions/celebrity_insults/) about Professor Hawking:

> A few years ago at Oxford Uni, my housemate was given the task of looking after Stephen Hawking just before he was due to address the Union. Presented with the opportunity to speak with arguably the world's greatest living scientist, perhaps to learn something about the fabric of time and space from this genius, the only thing my mate could think of to ask him was:

> "So, er... how fast does that chair go?"

> Unfazed, Professor Hawking replied: "I'll show you!", floored it (if that's the right term) and zoomed off down the corridor.
$C: So he‚Äôs gone then...my heart aches and my mind is broken. Who will answer the call to fill shoes so large? Has humanity even earned his existence? 
$C: And he passes on Pi Day too. What a legend!
$C: Humanity just lost a big portion of its chance at survival.
$C: Ah fuck. Rust in vrede. He truly was something special.
$C: He's Stephen Hawked now :(
$C: Hawking will live on for centuries, and thousands of years from now on. He will be remembered. 
$C: I... Jesus. Since I was a kid he's been a huge inspiration to me. His mind is incredible and he's contributed so much to society, especially considering his disease.
$C: Farewell to such a great man with such a great mind. Hope we can see you soon.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I heard the news slightly earlier today, laughed it off and didn‚Äôt believe it. Its starting to sink in now that I‚Äôll never be able to meet the man I‚Äôve wanted to meet for so many years. 
All my inspirations(Albert Einstein, Galileo Galilei, Stephen Hawking and Nikola Tesla) are all gone except for Elon Musk. Oh I hope to meet him some day....
$C: Man, It actually hurts to come to terms with the fact that Stephen Hawking is dead. There will always be great minds to come forward, and maybe some that even supersede the intelligence of Hawking and the greatest minds we've seen. But there will never be another person like this man. Truly a sad say, on 3/14 nonetheless. May he rest in peace. 
$C: Stephen Hawking was born on the date of Galileo's death, the 8th of January.

He has died on the date of Albert Einstein's birth, the 14th of March.
$C: /u/areallyshitusername did he die on Albert Einstein's birthday or something?
$C: RIP Professor Hawking. You have inspired many to follow your path.

If only we had developed a spacecraft for you to travel in earlier, if only...
$C: Hawking was an incredible man and an incredible physicist. But, he also gave us information and warnings about the future and the evolution of things such as AI. 

I think the least we can do is make sure his work isn't lost and that the warnings he gave should hopefully be listened to and prevented in every way. 
$C: Rest in peace brother.
$C: [deleted]
$C: When I read A Brief History of Time as an undergrad, I knew that I wanted to be a scientist. His impact on physics and its reputation are undeniable, but he also ha an impact on science in general through his public engagement. RIP.
$C: Does anyone know what his last words were?
$C: RIP. He should've become much older.
$C: I guess now he knows the answer to one of lifes biggest question. 
$C: I am actually crying now what a legendüò£
$C: At least you got to see your buddies send a car into space.

Run in the cosmos buddy.
$C: He was such a genius and a great person. We are going to miss him :(
RIP.
$C: One of the greatest of all time
$C: Adam West, my grandfather, John Dunsworth, and now Hawking within a year? This is rough for me.

It's funny, considering their age and conditions they were the most likely to go, yet the least likely for me to ever consider living on the planet without. 

Rest in peace, Hawking, and thank you for all of you contributions with your time on earth. So inspiring.
$C: Damn the Russians are really killing anyone in the UK right now...

Joke aside, rip Mr Hawking, the scientific community lost one of its brightest star
$C: Fitting for him to die on pi day
$C: Given 2 years to live at 21 years old. What a legend. 
$C: Aww damn that sucks, well he‚Äôs lived a full life and has contributed inimitably to our world. Ill be having a glass of whiskey and watching The theory if everything in honor of his life, highly recommend the movie if you haven‚Äôt watched.
$C: A truly legendary inspiration who will be remembered and missed. 
$C: rip, he lived a very fullfilling life. 
$C: Humanity just lost one of their most important leaders.
$C: And the World just turned a little bit dummer
$C: He lived around 40 more years than what the doctors told him, what a beast of a man, rest in peace you inspiring bastard
$C: I known about him since I was a child but can someone give me the tldr on why he is so famous? Has he proven theories or have widely accepted theories?

$C: RIP to one of the greatest people to grace humanity 
$C: >Life would be tragic if it weren't funny. - Stephen Hawking

Amazing scientist...but one with a great sense of humor.

$C: He‚Äôs one of my heroes. A truly brilliant person on all levels, and I hope to bring a fraction of such brilliance in his honor
$C: Plot twist: Hawking was a Russian spy
$C: Neil said it best, his tweet about him actually made me cry a bit. Now I'm feeling like I've wasted a huge chunk of my life and I want to do more because of his passing.
$C: That‚Äôs really sad. :(

The world has lost a great mind and a great man today. He worked through an insanely tough life and accomplished so much!!

RIP
$C: I didn't care about a lot of celebrities dying but this makes me sad. This man was a genius on the true sense of the word. RIP.
$C: Couldn‚Äôt move a muscle but lived and achieved more than most!!
$C: Guess this what getting older means. I‚Äôm almost in shock. 
$C: I can only hope all of his questions have been answered.
$C: Surprised that he lived that long.
$C: We as the humanity have to SAVE HIS BRAIN
$C: I've already commented on another thread, but I just found out a few minutes ago, and it's such sad news. Even though I never met him, it's been awesome knowing I lived on the same planet with someone like him. May he rest easy.
$C: RIP Stephen Hawking. You were truly one of the greatest influences in my life and helped give me my love of science :(
$C: Farewell to a brilliant mind
$C: Isn't it weird that this comes 1 day after the anouncement of Nectome?
$C: I know this comment is just going to be buried, but I think it‚Äôs of note that Hawking died on Einsteins birthday, who also lived to be 76. Today is also Pi Day. (3.14)
$C: Didn't even realize he was that old.

RIP, such an amazing individual.
$C: This made my heart sink. Growing up this man was one of my inspirations for going into STEM. Rest In Peace. The world needs more innovative and creative minds like yours. 
$C: Sad start to the day. Will people be able to use his computer to see any last words, works and ideas he was working on?
$C: Today was the birth of Albert Einstein. And today is the day we lost Stephen Hawking.
$C: He was a heroe. "A Brief history of time" was one of the best books I read and changed my life. Thanks professor Hawking for all you taught to us.
Even in his death he was incredible. March 14: Albert Einstein born and also Pi number 3,14
$C: *God has disconnected from the server*
$C: ‚ÄúRemember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet‚Äù - will do professor üëçüèª‚ú®üî≠ 
$C: Everyone is talking what his death
Even my teachers and friends.
$C: Bloody good run old boy! 
*salutes in British*
$C: May he rest in peace. Made important contributions to science.
$C: I wish they could have strapped him in the Tesla.
$C: OMG rip :( You will be missed!!!! Thank you for your amazing contributions to the world. 
$C: Such an inspirational guy, truly showed us what  you can achieve even when the odds are stacked against you 
$C: At least he saw the first steps to colonize Mars with the lunch of the falcon heavy by the guidance of Elon Musk, pity though the technology to download ones mind isn't avaliable yet, thus is mind would be forever lost, or is it? 
$C: What an absolute legend, thank you for your contributions to science Steven, what a hero. 
$C: Is anyone else hoping Elon Musk is in charge of his funeral. If there‚Äôs one man deserving of a space burial it‚Äôs Hawking. 
$C: Despite his illness I never even considered Steven Hawking would die even in my lifetime and I'm only in my mid-20s. Completely caught off guard.

RIP. He lived an amazing life and influenced more of the world than almost anyone ever could. Hopefully his family get peace from the rest of the world while they deal with his passing.
$C: Physics has lost a legend today. Shame he couldn't find the theory of everything before passing (which would be almost impossible) but he broke so much new ground and paved the way for present-day physics. He had a great run ! 
$C: i hope he is with the aliens right now !!!! RIP 
$C: Amazing mind and person

May he rest in peace
$C: He‚Äôs the first person I could honestly eulogize ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gone up to that great big supermassive black hole in the sky.‚Äù
$C: Hawking was an icon, I am truly saddened by the loss of one of mankind's greatest minds. 
$C: I was reading A Brief History Of Time at my junior high school age, Although it‚Äôs too difficult to understand these theories about the Time and space,but master Hawking inspired my interest in think about the universe and the secret behind our life.
Thank you master Hawking 
May God blessing you 
$C: I was watching the theory of everything last night and now I see that he is dead... I don't know how to feel about this :|
$C: I really loved his book, a Brief History of Time. It explains everything about the universe in such way that anyone can understand, and it changed the way I think about life. 

Thank you Stephen Hawking.
$C: Was the cause of death even ALS?
$C: Thank you Mr Hawkins. RIP
$C: May you walk amongst the minds you've inspired..
$C: Gosh. May he Rest In Peace. With all the other great minds. 
$C: He made it long enough for Pi Day.
$C: This man showed us no matter what your struggles but if we are motivated and determined nothing can stop us! Respect and RIP
$C: Wow incredible how long he‚Äôs lived for he was supposed to die in the 70s
$C: aww shit :( just started my physics graduation. This man was an inspiration as a scientist and more importantly as a human being.
$C: I was hoping to die before. I'm really sad. One of the brightest minds of the 20th century. I still remember when at 9 (1990) i read "from the big bamg to the black holes", I fall in love his mind. RIP
$C: Damn... RIP one of the greatest mind in Earth...
$C: In testament to his great sense of humor, of course he passes away on Pi Day. We lost a great one.
$C: It's odd. It's like I didn't think he would die, but I am still so surprised he lived to be 76. That's a fairly long life!
$C: Damn this is not what I planned on waking up to this morning 
$C: An inspirational man - one of great wisdom and knowledge. He will be greatly missed. 
$C: And now he is in space heaven fucking Alexa.
$C: Another UK national treasure has left us. A mastermind.
$C: The death of stephan hawking is like a black hole for science. such a brilliant man it was.
$C: Let's hope this is just a clone body and the real Stephen Hawking is now in a healing process by a Time traveller .
$C: This man, out of every day of the year this man dies on pi day. What a legend, even in death he stays classy and brilliant. RIP Hawking 1.8.1942 - 3.14.2018.
$C: He outlived the doctor's expectations. He lived long for his condition. Sad to see him go.
$C: I read only the other day that he believed himself to be on track for a Nobel Prize in his lifetime, apparently having finally gathered sufficient evidence to prove Hawking Radiation. What a shame it wasn‚Äôt peer reviewed in time. Hopefully someone will build upon his work and finally claim that prize for his theory. And I do believe a posthumous knighthood would be highly applicable in this instance 
$C: See you in another life, brotha. 
$C: Truly a living miracle and inspiration to ALL MANKIND.

I would be dead 10x over it wouldn't've been for Hawkins sheer will and intellectual prowess.  

I will NOT miss him, I will KEEP him and all of his wonderful and inspiring ideas that he has shared with humanity.   RIP SH, you deserve it.

$C: There‚Äôs one helluva *intelligent* Hawking & Einstein party happening now in heaven. RIP Hawking and Happy Birthday Einstein. 
$C: > celebrate's

This bothers me more than it should...

$C: Wow, sad news. He will be missed.
$C: It was comforting to know he was alive. I always felt like somehow - no matter how bad things got - when the need arose, Stephen Hawking would save us.
$C: Wow...my cousin just died on Monday (wayyyyyyyy to young at the age of 30).  I literally JUST finished writing out a sympathy card and tried to stop crying by hopping on Reddit.  I hoped to see something funny and this is the first thing I saw!!!!  üåü
     Oddly enough, I‚Äôm feeling peace for the first time in days, knowing my cousin is out there somewhere in this, or an alternate, Universe (hopefully) with this Extraordinarily gifted theoretical physicist.  
    In depth, ridiculously advanced posits, such as his, are the basis for my musing about life after death.  I no longer believe in heaven, but I believe our souls (minds) travel to another plane, or time, or dimension.  
   This sounds quite deluded, but without knowing what ACTUALLY happens after death, this thought process helps me cope with loss.  Science is constantly evolving and I believe nearly anything is possible given how far we have advanced by having insanely intelligent people theorize Physics.  When I was a kid Pluto was a planet and In the 1500‚Äôs the Catholic Church spat upon one of the earliest scientific geniuses.   That which we have not yet discovered, or proven, or disproven in Science, specifically physics (in this context) leads to endless possibilities for a probable afterlife (in my nearly completely uninformed opinion üòÜ). 
Ironically Stephen Hawking has the same first name as my deceased cousin.  

 
TL/DR:  my cousin died too young on Monday and now resides in the afterlife with an extremely gifted intellectual, not necessarily heaven, but perhaps in another dimension of space and time.   I‚Äôll have to delve into Hawking‚Äôs theories and attempt to figure out if my idea of the afterlife could be possible üòä
$C: R.I.P. Truly sad news :(
$C: Godspeed Stephen. You revolutionised the universe
$C: The article said he died in the early hours of Wednesday, if that's true he died on March 14th (Pi Day) which is kind of a funny/morbid coincidence. 
$C: We owe it to him to honor his legacy by making an effort to pursue, and utilize his research towards understanding space and physics 
$C: https://youtu.be/maK_-NZhTFY
$C: My heart hurts now :(
$C: Holy shit dude
$C: Incredible how long he kept going, each year that passed I kept seeing him still with us.

At the first time I learned about him, I was not aware he had been diagnosed such a long time ago, and just told myself "it's sad that we have such an important mind that we can potentially lose in just a few months", but then I learned that he was diagnosed with his illness 55 YEARS AGO, and for years he kept going and going, and not only that, he was still teaching us under this condition, and with a good sense of humour in a situation I think no one would have, it was just amazing and unthinkable something like that would be possible, but he did it!

Always every year that passed I kept wondering what was something he could still do before either passing away, or becoming unable to communicate with us completely, I believe that in such a long time he did everything he wanted to.

He was such a beloved figure, a massive inspiration for all of us, and for me to keep going as well.

["My advice to other disabled people would be, concentrate on things your disability doesn't prevent you doing well, and don't regret the things it interferes with. Don't be disabled in spirit as well as physically."](https://i.imgur.com/w7SDyy4.jpg)
$C: So did they cryonically freeze him or what?
$C: This one hit me way harder than I expected
$C: I know how Reddit works, but it's times like this that I just can't bring myself to up vote a topic. :(
$C: tbh he looks good for 76 especially with his condition
$C: This was a punch in the gut last night. I have grown up consuming books and television programing that he was involved in, I still do. He will be sorely missed.
$C: Amazing individual, rare. I wonder what the difference would be had he not been restricted by his illness.
$C: 76. A normal life span for such an extraordinary man...It's like a little bit older means suffering too much for him, and if less than that, it'll be pitiful. 
$C: the fact that he Died on Pi Day seems very fitting. 
$C: RIP Stephen Hawking

Your work was legendary and you will be remembered for centuries to come as a brilliant scientist and one of the greatest minds of the modern world.Ôªø You gave the world so very much. The strength & ability you showed the world. It is the best example that nothing could hold you back from achieving your life's Works & Goals!
May you now fly, run & play with all those you've adored.
My deepest condolences to all his family & friends around the world!
PEACE. LOVE. DREAM'S.
$C: Anyone else find it interesting that he died on Einstein‚Äôs birthday?
$C: Rest in peace great mind, you have all the answers now
$C: Rest in peace Hawking. What a great mind and person. 
$C: Well this is the 2nd biggest news story on Reddit, most likely to be #1 soon. So glad to see people care. 

Edit: Officially biggest story 
$C: That moment when you actually cry
$C: You are missed, Professor Hawking. 
$C: Passes away on pi day..
$C: This is truly awful. I never really thought this could happen. We lost somebody great today
$C: I wonder if it's fitting that he died on Pi day.
$C: To infinity and beyond. RIP Professor Stephen Hawking.

Truly a great loss.
$C: Pouring out some champagne for my man Hawking

http://vozme.com/speech/en-ml/d7/d7b662645041187c5e755d3a377abd12.mp3
$C: just when they announced they could preserve the brain's neurons & synapses for hundreds of years too, but haven't started doing it for humans yet, that sucks.
$C: How long til Hollywood makes a movie on his life?
!reminds me 3 months 
$C: Died on Pi Day AND on Albert Einstein's birthday.
$C: RIP. What a brilliant mind he had.
$C: RIP Dr. Hawking. We'll see no greater a mind than yours in our lifetime.
$C: He certainly had interesting ideas and theories. Time moves on. 
$C: What an amazing person. He will be truly missed by all especially in the scientific community. I hope everyone strives to better the human race as a whole like he did; It‚Äôs people like him that inspired me to study Engineering and try to do good in the world. I hope one day I can come anywhere near him in terms of bettering the human race as a whole.

May his final journey into the cosmos be a peaceful one.
$C: He was such a good friend to us here on Reddit, too
$C: Damn, my name lost a bit of its kick now.
$C: RIP, one of the brightest humans ever. Used to make profiles of him for school assignments. 

Talk about outplaying the hand you were dealt. 

Beautiful comments. Sail on you starborn  wanderer. May gravity no longer bind you. 
$C: That didn't take long, [the idiots are chiming in now....](https://twitter.com/BriscoeCain/status/973779271230676994)
$C:  :'(
Words alone can't describe how sad I am. 
$C: His book A Brief History of Time opened my eyes and I saw my existence in this universe in a whole new light. Thank you Sir.
$C: dude demonstrated - even when it seems all the light has gone - one can still radiate
$C: This hit me like I didn‚Äôt think it would üò¢ We had to do presentations while acting as famous people in high school - an exercise to build confidence and public speaking skills. I pretended to be Stephen Hawking and researched the guy extensively. Having read his book also I was a total fan, except in this field scientists aren‚Äôt usually given the celebrity status they truly deserve. He will be missed. 
$C: May his departed soul find peace and serenity, condolences to the family for the loss.
$C: Rest in peace. What an inspiration. 
$C: An outstanding harmonica player!
$C: They say that we all stand on the shoulders of giants.  They guys that follow after Hawking will need high altitude training.
$C: Wow, this is the most popular news ever posted to this subreddit as of 3/22/18!
$C: 2 weeks and still on page 2
$C: Hope he goes to heaven. Wait...
$C: it's kinda crazy to think it was over 150 days ago when this happened but it feels like it was yesterday
$C: Gonna be the last comment my nibbaa
$C: [deleted]
$C: His achievements will be forever remembered. He has inspired hundreds to pursue science. I can only hope he rests well.
$C: "I regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail. There is no heaven or afterlife for broken down computers; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark." 

-Stephen Hawking
$C: [deleted]
$C: May he rest in peace. A great loss for mankind.
$C: I never really expected him to die. It's just weird, almost like the Queen dying or something.
$C: The thought of this happening never crossed my mind. This hit hard. Rest in peace

$C: They should announce these things a day early, so that the person can see all these nice comments before they go. 
$C: Fuck.
Lost a good one today.
RIP
$C: Wow. He was living proof that a disability can never hold you back from achieving greatness. RIP, Mr Hawking
$C: I hope those ALS ice bucket challenges helped prolonged his life. Thank you
$C: Worst celebrity death since Steve Irwin. RIP in a peace. 
$C: Did the Russians get him too?
$C: He would die on Pi Day.
$C: This is so sudden I don't even know what to say. RIP Stephen, and deepest condolences to his family. 
$C: Wow, I never imagined he would die, since he was kicking the Grim Reaper's ass for so long. 

Rest in peace, Mr. Hawking. You deserved it. The world is better that you were in it. 
$C: Pretty real for making it to 76 
$C: Such sad news.

At least he beat his original life expectancy by like 50 years, what an incredible man.
$C: I'm really surprised he lived as long as he did. I had an uncle with ALS - he lived for about 3 years if iirc. 

Hopefully Prof. Hawking donated his body to science to it can be studied. I really want to find out how he was different from most other ALS sufferers. Rest in peace. 
$C: People who launch human progress as much as he did are modern day saints. You will be greatly missed, Dr. Hawking.
$C: A loss of the human race
$C: Worlds iq just dropped :(
$C: I know there have been a lot of celebrity deaths over the past few years, but this is the only one that really makes me feel that *life* is worse off because of it..
$C: Such tragic news.  I loved reading his literature.  He will be sorely missed.
$C: Thankful for the time he did have on this earth and all the good he did with it. 
$C: One of the greatest, rest in peace Mr. Hawking.
$C: Serious question: How the actual fuck did he live til 76 with ALS?
$C: RIP Mr Hawking. You impacted more people than you'll ever know. You were such an inspiration. 
$C: He made science accessible, but didn‚Äôt talk down to people. He was personable, without it feeling forced. He will be missed. 
$C: Truly an amazing human being. May he rest in peace.
$C: He needs to be cremated and sent into space so he can travel through space like he always wanted
$C: May he rest in peace. His contributions to science have ensured that he will never die, and his name will be remembered for centuries to come.
$C: " We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special. "

One of my favorite quotes of his.  

Hope he's shining and reflecting all throughout the universe as a beam of light, soaking it all in.  RIP
$C: A great man has been lost.
$C: What a sad day. That man must have lived one incredible life. We've not only lost a brilliant scientist, but an amazingly kind soul and role model. He was so lucky to overcome the obstacles that he did, & give so many people inspiration. Stephen Hawking, you will be sorely missed. RIP.
$C: R.I.P Stephen Hawkings, we lost a brilliant human being today.
$C: His passing is a loss for all of humanity. 
$C: Fuck man. Probably the smartest man of our time, too. Rest in peace Stephen.
$C: Guy died on the day of pi... not a coincidence, he truly deserves this day to himself, contributed so much to math and science..
RIP and I only have respect for this man.
$C: R.I.P. - just realized he passed on Pi Day. 
$C: It‚Äôs crazy that this is kind of something I would expect to happen because of his condition but when it does I‚Äôm fucking shocked. Sucks man... he will be missed. 
$C: RIP Stephen Hawking.

If there is something beyond death, I'm sure he's happily dissecting their physics already.
$C: I‚Äôm devastated, I looked up to him more then anyone else on earth besides perhaps my parents. Mankind has lost a true champion of science today.
$C: You know, the sad thing is, during the last year I was reminiscing about Hawking's biographical film and I thought to myself "Stephen Hawking is going to die one day, and that could be in the next few years."  The simple thought of that saddened me because he felt sort of immortal and I couldn't fathom him dying.  When I saw this on my Twitter feed I couldn't believe it.  Rest in piece.
$C: He even died on Pi Day ‡≤†‚ï≠‚ïÆ‡≤†
$C: He had the greatest talking motorcycle of all time.
$C: If he‚Äôs so smart, why he dead?
$C: He was born on Galileo's death day and died on Einstein's birthday.
What a coincidence
$C: Isn't he that physicist that invented gravity?
$C: What did he do to be considered one of the greatest minds of all time? Wasn't he wrong in some calculations for a black hole? I'm pretty sure he studied mainly black holes all his career, and may have made us all understand them better, but what did he do that people are comparing him to Newton and Einsten?

Don't get me wrong, the man was a genius and was able to understand so much and explain so much to us. But in pure scientific discovery and research, did he have much to offer? I'm just curious because I'd love to know. Maybe a quick TLDR of his career. A summary. 
$C: How old did you guys really expect him to live?
$C: RIP Greatest Scientist of all Time
$C: he didn't wheely die did he?
$C: Rest In Peace. I looked up to him. 

I find it somewhat suiting that he passed on pi day, 3/14, a math "holiday".
$C: The true definition of a legend. And what a legacy. RIP Mr Hawking. You will not be forgotten. 
$C: RIP. He was a great man.
$C: It was a great loss for everyone...
$C: >I have no idea. People who boast about their IQ are losers.
*Response upon being questioned as to his IQ, in interview with Deborah Solomon "The Science of Second-Guessing", The New York Times (12 December 2004.*

Pay attention to a real genius, Donny.
$C: May he live among the stars 
$C: This is messing with me so much more than I ever thought it would. He was synonymous with science in my mind. The world will never be the same.
$C: In other news, the average IQ for a human being significantly decreased today..
$C: He donated his mind to science in life, and I hope he does too in death.
$C: I actually had the thought last week, ‚Äúwow I wonder when Stephen Hawking is going to die, that‚Äôs gonna suckkkk‚Äù


... did I kill Stephen Hawking???!!! 
$C: If Stephen Hawking fell in the woods and no one was around to hear him, would his wheelchair call for help?
$C: Through disproving god he became immortal.

$C: what happened? I hadn't heard anything about his condition worsening or the like. 
$C: Sorry if death serving as motiviation seems a horrible thing to some of you, but i have been procrasinating on reading some Hawkings. Now i will read it for sure. As the One Piece's Dr. Hiruluk 'roughly' puts it,

 "when does a man truly die, when he eats a poisonous mushroom, when he is struck by a bullet, or when he is a victim of ALS, no. Not then. A man truly dies when he is forgotten."

We will all remember you Mr. Hawking. And so will many generations. Thank you for sparking in interest in so many of us.  
$C: I thought he died along time ago and was replaced in the 80s 
$C: Sooooo Stephen Hawking died on PI Day. Why are we not talking about this
$C: Woah. I woke up thinking this was fake, unreal.
$C: Have they tried turning him on and off again?

/s 
$C: That feeling when you look at the laws of physics and ask, "are you sure?" and devote your life to real answers. 
$C: And he dies on Pi day.
$C: Fortitude. Intelligence. Critical Thinking. Perseverance.

This is what he stands for. Goodbye, Professor Hawking.
$C: My wife just told me about this, and I thought she was joking..until I checked reddit.


I actually got the chance to see him in person once. I was walking through an airport, and we made eye contact, but I just kind of stood there and waved because I was too embarrassed. The only thing I could think of was: What does someone like myself say to one such as him without sounding like a dullard?

Son of a bitch, this sucks. I looked up to people like him when I was a kid. The world is truly worse off without him, and I know I don't speak for myself when I say that he will be sorely missed.


$C: We've lost two great men recently, one a preacher, the other a physicist. Both had a great influence on millions. Now the ball is in Pascal's court.

I don't mean that in jest. Really makes you think.
$C: I wonder if the God particle told him to go to the hell particle. 
$C: He is no longer an atheist.

$C: RIP man, I never got a chance to see him for real. I wanted to see how his voice automation thing works
$C: I like how everyone only says nice things about someone when they die. People (you) loved to shit on this guy whenever an article involving him came up
$C: I was not expecting this before my physics exam tomorrow....
$C: 2018 is just not our year as humanity is it?
$C: Whaaaat?!  Wow, don't know much about him except what I read or hear.  He was just one of those guys you just look up to and admire, like Einstein.   Your will be missed Mr Hawkins.

$C: Wtf I just gave my bf my celebrity sex list and he was the first one on it
$C: He even managed to die in a Pi day...(3.14)
Genius
$C: He died on pi day. 
$C: I mean, I even have no relatives to live that long
$C: I feel strange giving a up vote to a title that says he died. It feels like I am saying "He died?! Neat!"
$C: We lost a great asset.
$C: Stephen Hawking died on PI day. That's pretty fitting for someone as smart as Stephen Hawking.

It's just astonishing what this man was able to achieve during his life with ALS. He lived a fulfilling life
$C: I'm glad he's finally able to rest in some peace. Being trapped in your own body sounds like hell. Part of me thinks he wanted to die but lived as long as he could for the good of those around him. 
$C: Damn. It makes me wonder how long he'd live if it weren't for the disease. 
$C: I find myself wondering... if Stephen Hawking had been noticeably disabled from birth would he have still been educated to reach his potential or just 'parked' in a special school followed by supported accommodation like so many are these days?

Whatever the answer is we need to recognise the potential of disabled people and the disadvantages that they face in education, employment, and life. 
$C: I am heartbroken. This is the most influential physicist since Einstein. Reminds me of Sagan's death. My grandmother and one of my role models in the same year, wow. Hawking and Neil Tyson made me fall in love with astronomy and study it. Prayers for his family.
$C: he lived passed his 20s, may he rest in peace 
$C: The guy who said "guess that makes me the smartest person in the world". He must watch a lot of Rick and Morty
$C: Couldn‚Äôt find a date/time of death.  Did he die on pi day?  Or was it last night?

$C: I have never felt bad about any deaths in my life, but Hawking going out breaks me up real bad, work in peace Proffeser Hawking, there's always more work to do.
$C: [Professor, scientist, psysicist,](https://imgur.com/a/ru9a4) but 1 thing is for sure. He was a great man. RIP Stephen Hawking.
$C: With his death goes one of the few scientists to steadfastly hold to warning of the ethical considerations of traveling blindly into singularity.  He called for scientists to make conscious decisions and action based on the ethical considerations of their work.   Now we‚Äôre stuck with Elon musk whose solution to singularity is to just merge us with computers so we become the singularity, a path fraught with ethical implications he and his colleagues urge us to not even think about.  

With him went the best chance we had to keep the science community from bringing us to extinction.
$C: God have mercy on his soul. He did a lot of good despite not being a believer in any God and actively leading others not to believe. He did so much good... I am a Christian and have also read his works. I have never felt any kind of pressure not to believe in God having read them. In fact I have only found a deeper understanding of God by reading them. The God I know will see the amount he wanted us to understand His universe which he created, and He will love Him all the more for it.  I honestly hope I see him in Heaven when I go. And to be honest, I‚Äôd say I need more hope than he does.

$C: The second smartest person in the world is loving this. 
$C: We will just have to wait until someone invents time travel so we can visit him at his party. 
$C: Ah man this news hurts. 

What an amazing human being and scientist. He will never be forgotten. Not by history nor by the universe as his remains will now freely flow throughout it. 

$C: Hopefully we'll meet again in his Hawking Hole. Rest easy, Mr. Hawking
$C: Holy crap I was thinking about him earlier today... I don't even know much about him, but was just thinking about what life being paralyzed would be like...and then i thought of death... No need to believe me, but lowkey may be psychic.
$C: I‚Äôve actually been wondering when he would die 
$C: Do you think they tried to clear his cache and cookies before pronouncing him? 
$C: What makes me really angry is what if Einstein had lived today? With todays technology? Or Hawkings had a normal body? I think they could had done so much more...

Incredible he lived this long. They said he would not make it past 30 with his disease. 
$C: Boom de yada, mi amigo.
$C: Most people can only dream of impacting the world the way he did, with all the challenges life threw his way. In the end, we are all made of star stuff üí´ 
$C: Damn i read all his horror books especially the shining, rest in peace Stephen
$C: So, I just woke up from a nap and this was the first post I saw on reddit. I seriously thought I was dreaming, but it‚Äôs unfortunate to know that this is a reality. 
But, I think we can all agree that we were lucky enough to live in the same timespan that he was alive. Truly an inspiration to for us all. 
R.I.P. Stephen Hawking
$C: Why is this post gilded two times? 
$C: Alright Sheldon this bazinga isn't funny. 
$C: Quick question...did he die a virgin? I really need to know...
$C: Sounds very similar to Stephan Austin the reptile enthusiast from Texas. Although the timing doesn‚Äôt connect, damn TIL. Thanks internet hobo.
$C: Holy shit - Brexit, with the banks leaving London for Germany & France, radioactive Russian murders, The deaths of those musicians and actors last year, the Muslim guys selling white girls in decades long sex ring & now Hawkins - Seems like the UK is completely falling apart
$C: hope he at least found the afterlife answers he was looking for, one way or another.
$C: The Russians got him too!?
$C: RIP Robotman, thankyou for inventing gravity and Microsoft Sam
$C: He‚Äôs more famous for his disability than anything else.

Coining the phrase ‚Äúbig bang theory‚Äù and ‚Äúsingularity‚Äù of black holes are his major contributions to science.  

Even then his analysis of black holes did not pretend to offer the holy grail that he was looking for: the unification of quantum theory and general relativity in a ‚Äútheory of everything.‚Äù 

Instead, his quantum analysis of black holes used a sort of patchwork of the two existing theories.

I find it hard to believe that a man can look so deeply into the cosmos and the foundations of life creating forces of the universe and still NOT believe in a God.

Personally, I think he‚Äôs currently having to do some ‚Äòsplainin‚Äô for missing such an obvious sign of the Almighty and leading so many astray.
$C: He's probably burning in Hell right now like a marshmallow, unless he accepted Jesus before death..RIP Mr Hawking
$C: [removed]
$C: can 2018 please just stop. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Oh man Sheldon is gonna be devastated


$C: I hope his passing will have a child ask his parents ‚ÄúWho is Stephen, mommy?‚Äù And then learn all about him, be inspired and eventually grow up to carry on the work. 

Thank you for your service to mankind, Mr. Hawking.
$C: fuck, thats sad ass hell.
F
$C: Thank you for legacy, mr. Hawking. May you rest in peace.
$C: Thank you, for just tying to make sense out of this space rock floating in infinity.
$C: I want to know what the last thing he said was. Had to be pretty epic.
$C: He is going to miss the first ever photo of the black hole's event horizon. RIP Stephen Hawkings
$C: The einstein of our time. RIP.
$C: Fuck, with all of the fucked up shit going on in the world, this is like the icing on the cake.  

RIP Mr Hawkings!
 
Godspeed to your family! 
$C: Wow...of all significant deaths, this one seems to be the hardest lol
$C: why does it seem like everyone is just finding out when BBC says they posted the story 3 hours ago
$C: This is gonna sound like I'm fucking lying but I swear I'm not. I spent pretty much the entire day at school today thinking about Stephen Hawking and now he's dead. I am in literal shock right now, what the hell am I supposed to do.
$C: Now im the smartest man on earth
$C: Are we sure it‚Äôs not a hoax ?  
$C: Did y'all not see it coming?!?!?! lmao
$C: Don't know anything about him other than the family guy skits. Did he invent something?
$C: Are we still hosting the time traveler parties?
$C: And here comes Reddit‚Äôs new science man phase!
$C: Gone but not forgotten, he put the big in the big bang theory RIP
$C: Damn, I was just watching last night the episode he was in Star Trek, sorry guys...
$C: It's a shame we've lost him, but I think it's best for him, since he could barely do anything and I'm assuming that caused tremendous mental pain
$C: Was he ill?
$C: he was a bit eccentric in his older age...kept going on about space aliens.  too much sci-fi.
$C: An outstanding  scientist üë®‚Äçüî¨ of our era.

$C: Who the fuck is gilding this, you autists 
$C: If "The Big Bang Theory" was a new episode this week, I bet they would do a tribute. 
$C: RIP black science man 
$C: Remember, without social healthcare, Stephen Hawking would have died before the age of thirty. He was forever thankful to the NHS for giving him a chance to live.

Many people with minds as brilliant as Hawking are dying each year in the US at a young age simply because they can't afford the costs or their insurance is not covering them. 

Hawking campaigned for social healthcare for this very reason. In the US, he would have died soon after diagnosis. 
$C: Finally he gets to rest in a black hole
$C: Have any of Hawkins‚Äô discoveries lead to any practical invention being created? 
$C: That's another vote for the Democrats.
$C: God gained another great... Oh never mind, it was just an internal computer failure according to the science wizard.
$C: He was a stand up guy.

Sorry, i'll let myself out.
$C: Nothing but threads on this damn Stephen guy.. does nobody realize that Craig Fucking Mack died? At least that dude contributed something to this world. What the fuck did this wheelchaired robot do? Did he put new flava in your ear? I don't fucking think so.
$C: On March 14, Einstein's birthday and Marx's death day
$C: Can we trade NDT in and get Hawking back?
$C: Steven Hawking‚Äôs last words into the voice emulator: ‚Äúeither Trump goes, or I do‚Äù.
$C: RIH I'm sorry your intelligence never brought you to the right path. I only hope you haven't condemned too many others too.
$C: I wonder what Hawkin's last words were. Probably, "Honey, I fear this disease will soon take my voice, and I will then need a machine to help me speak"... Too soon? 
$C: Not to pull from the moment, but Fox News is practically having a party to celebrate. Edit:  Just go and look before they change their front page.
$C: good news. he got too much attention without a real reason, there are better scientists that nobody knows their name
$C: [deleted]
$C: He died not knowing the truth. On his second resurrection he will see the truth. As will those that did not. For I have and I will possibly die knowing truth, but will rejoice knowing it upon waking up a second time anew. 
$C: What will the conversation be like between him and God?
$C: wow, an old person dying. *shocker!*
$C: stephen hawking wasnt even that smart lol 
$C: Steven Hopkins was anti-Zionist. Every Zionist cried fowl when he decided to boycott Israel. This means, he wasn't only a genius, he was also a brave and principled man. So long live Hawking memory, and fuck Zionists; Fuck Israel.
$C: Fuck, someone beat me to it... I mean RIP.
$C: Ha CNN won't even cover it because of this special election. 

No agenda there. 
$C: i like some of his words but in the future we'll look back at him and he'll likely have no real scientific accomplishments - likely not even one

but miss and praise him all you like, your religious leader has fallen, so sad for you 
$C: [removed]
$C: Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. This man may have had intellect but he lacked wisdom. I bet he regrets mocking God about now. 

Don't be foolish like Stephen. Love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul and strength. 
$C: Psalms  14:1 
 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.
$C: died long ago, was used for propaganda, no one lives that long with ALS
$C: Meh, who cares? He was an overrated scientist. I mean, he even believed in climate change. Everyone knows climate change is fake news. Such an idiot. Sad.
$C: He's finally with God.  And I hope once he meets our maker, he realizes how wrong he was, and how much damage he's caused by not accepting our Christian ways.
$C: Well glad he‚Äôll finally meet his creator whose existence he kept denying throughout his life. 
$C: Sad that this oldman was used like a puppet and his handlers faked his persona and intelligence.
$C: [removed]
$C: He‚Äôs basically a Science Bro, love it
$C: What a magnificent bastard.
$C: If you're gonna be in a wheelchair you may as well make the most of it. 
$C: Hahaha, epic
$C: > intentional running over of students' toes

I'm going to assume this to be a joke, otherwise that would make him kind of asshole-ish
$C: They'd better, after standing him up at the party he threw for them.
$C: We're all time travellers, maaannn, just in one direction.
$C: They've already been to his funeral. Several times...
$C: This was obviously his master plan. 
$C: They probably will, just cloaked so we can't see them.
$C: Already did. 
$C: I expect at least 42.
$C: Already did.
$C: They already have.
$C: Wrong side of existence. They are waiting for him on the other side.
$C: They're already there.
$C: I hope so. My experience with time travelers is limited mostly to Doctor Who, and the Christmas Specials where time travelers often meet are the best ones! 
$C: If i lived in the future and hada time machine, I would
$C: Science will never forget him. If time travelers do come I bet the science will be due to something Stephen discovered
$C: :( :( :( also feel like this is the biggest drop in the average IQ of humanity since some time 
$C: It was super depressing. Not to be a pedant but the British call them time lords not time travellers.
$C: Won‚Äôt they have already attended? O.o
$C: I'm sure they already did that.
$C: Even if they did, we would never know :P
$C: They wanted to come, but they were busy at that time.
$C: They'll see this and use caution. In all seriousness I'm so fucking bummed out.
$C: His sense of humour was through the ceiling. 
I‚Äôve done a lot of research and beyond, every experience was amazing. 
Hilarious and a fucking genius.
So heartbreaking to see a glorious human being go. 

I‚Äôm excited to see all of his work shared in the future and what others can do to expand on it. 

Our future has such a beneficial expanse because of him and the way he thought. 

He was the shit. He always humbly knew it. What a way to go.‚ô•Ô∏è
$C: no, not shielded anyway.
$C: I mean... What if a younger Stephen Hawking is there.
$C: Probably not, he proved it doesn't exist.
$C: I already attended it. He was a great man.
$C: Unfortunately, we're the original timeline.
$C: I‚Äôm studying at his college, Gonville & Caius, in Cambridge. I‚Äôll definitely make an effort to sign his book of condolence, as he was on of the people that inspired me to study science in the first place. RIP
$C: We're on the timeline that we were never visited by time travelers sadly.
$C: That's gold
$C: From the past maybe, but not from the future
$C: They already did
$C: time Travel.   I asked this question or statement before.   

What if time travel just involves someone viewing history unfold through some sort of video screen (as you a televised show) where you can view any position in the world at any given moment; but it will impossible to interact with events that have already happened.

Like light in Space..the light was produced years ago, but you can view any way we want, but unable to change the light itself.   

Its't always time and space...or did I get that from a Star Trek episodes 

$C: Best comment 
$C: I feel a bit uncomfortable people liking the caption... steven hawking has died? Was he that a guy?
$C: Even if ~~we~~ they did show, it would imperative not to be discovered. If time travel was proven to exist, how many resources would be dumped into figuring it out? You think the cold war was bad... imagine everyone fighting to keep anyone else from figuring it out first. That is why the discovery of time travel must happen naturally and can not be confirmed before its natural discovery. 
$C: Stephen Hawking proved it's impossible to travel back in time. Forward all the way
$C: Welcome to the 21st
$C: >Be me, have the ability to travel to any time I wish. Spend my time staring at dead people in wood boxes.

Sounds legit.
$C: Doubtful. I'd rather be at Gauss's or Euler's funeral.
$C: Same. At first I was thinking ‚Äútoo soon!‚Äù Then I saw 76 and was more ‚Äúnot too bad, considering.‚Äù
$C: Think how many of the common causes of aging just don't apply to him - probably gets very little sun.  He's not even prone to wrinkles, since he doesn't make facial expressions.  He's been stooped and in glasses since he was very young-  so what else has changed about his appearance over the last 30 years?   

I didn't realize how old he was until I saw that movie Theory Of Everything and realized how far back the setting was.
$C: I honestly thought he would die at 100 or something, this came out of nowhere.
$C: I literally cannot remember a time during my life that I wasn't aware of Stephen Hawking's existence. He has been an legend my entire experience on Earth.
$C: Neither did I. It‚Äôs incredible he lived to such an age and was able to influence so many people as well. RIP
$C: His age is the most shocking about this to me.
$C: He was the living definition of "never tell me the odds!" because they were all in his head.
$C: Hawkings Effect. We all grew up thinking he was always in his 40s 
$C: 76, damn, he lived a fulfilling life 
$C: Dude killed it
$C: While filming that episode, Stephen Hawking was taken on a tour of the engineering set; indicating the warp core, he said, "I'm working on that." 
$C: Really great that he got to be on the best Scofield show ever. Data is my favorite character too so it's awesome to see Stephen will forever live on in star trek as well
$C: I like to imagine that was a lot of fun for him. I absolutely love that scene. 
$C: Excluding stock footage he's the only person in the entirety of Star Trek to play himself. 
$C: I don't even have to click on the link to know what it is. That was such a great episode of Star Trek and I'm glad he got to be in a very cool scene like that.
$C: He looks so happy at the end! 
$C: Is this is an actual scene from Star Trek?
$C: I knew it would be this! First thing I thought of as well!
$C: I'm sure he absolutely loved doing that too.

He really had a great personality for blending science and people.
$C: this was my first thought when I heard the news.
$C: Honestly thought it was going to be this video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muo8sIfgXkY
$C: They really packed on Einstein's makeup.
$C: Woah that was awesome
$C: I figured he'd move to Paradox-Billiards-Vostroyan-Roulette-Fourth Dimensional-Hypercube-Chess-Strip Poker after he mastered plain poker.
$C: Always respected Hawking for not upgrading his voice.

We‚Äôve certainly lost one of the century‚Äôs greatest minds, but hope technology can immortalize him by continuing to use his voice.
$C: Generations that haven't been born yet will ask us what it was like having Hawking alive the same way we wonder what it was like when Einstein was alive.
$C: Truly an inspiring figure. 
$C: I nominate him for a position on the all time greatest list.
$C: One of the finest examples of the human race, period
$C: What exactly did he accomplish in terms of science? 
$C: Greatest minds of all time I would say
$C: The greatest mind. 
$C: > RIP to one of the greatest minds

This guy thought that some asteroid containing life, hit Earth and created all life. Because the asteroid came from outside our solar system, he did not need to explain how the life on the asteroid originated.

I guess he had a great mind for story telling... 

$C: I have a friend on Facebook who is asking what all the cause for the hero worship is.

Like I know the guy was a theoretical physicist, so it's not like he was out there making your TV's fancier or anything, but even after I linked him to his Wikipedia page listing all his papers and accomplishments and fields of study, he still came back with (paraphrasing) "well Einstein helped us build atomic bomb, what has Stephen Hawking done for us, it's not like the black hole stuff even matters"
$C: He influenced educators, learners from across the world https://www.edarabia.com/how-stephen-hawking-influenced-learners-world/
$C: I'd argue not just the past century, but recorded history.  He's up there with Pythagoras and Newton and Tesla.

$C: Say what you will about Hawking's personal morals or anything else, nobody can deny that dude had a sense of humor about it. I can't think of many scientists so willing to be on TV and poke fun at their own disabilities...or people in general


$C: And he took those jokes with incredible stride. Ironic considering the man hadn't physically strided in decades. 
$C: "Life would be tragic, if it weren't funny" 

- Stephen Hawking
$C: > For all the jokes made at his expense

He would have typed ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha along with us. 
$C: I don't know that the jokes were made at his expense. Jokes about his condition were a sort of metaphor for the unpredictability and balance of life. You can't really make fun of the genius who figured out the secrets of the universe. It's a strange irony that the man we look up to is forever sitting down in a wheelchair.


Each of us has all the potential for frailty that Dr  Hawking possessed, but his intellect and insight were unique in the cosmos. 
$C: Hope the Staircase to Heaven is wheelchair accessible...
$C: Yea I‚Äôm expecting jokes about how it was the computer the whole time blah blah blah
$C: I'm in shock. I just kind of accepted Dr. Hawking would be around for my whole life. This is so strange.

$C: I'm proud to know that I existed for a part of his life, and was able to be see such a brilliant mind excel in his career despite his medical condition. Even though he has passed, he will live on in memory thanks to the incredible work he has done. 
$C: The guy had such spirit that I don‚Äôt feel the need to feel sorry for him. The guy basically took ALS for a ride in his boss chair, having a laugh and performing groundbreaking science at the same time. He lived an A tier life despite massive setbacks, good bloody job!
$C: Who made jokes about Stephen Hawking?  Bastards!
$C: >For all the jokes made at his expense

Who are they, I will fight them
$C: He probably lived the most fulfilling life you can live given his circumstances. He really did make the most of what he was given
$C: The article states "Hawking contracted motor neurone disease in 1963 and was given two years to live..."
$C: He achieved more on borrowed time most can hope to in their lifetime. 
$C: He's pretty much his generation's Einstein.
$C: Yup, a true fighter who beat all odds to contribute heavily to science and humanity as a whole.. Will be dearly missed
$C: He lived like 40+ years longer than anyone ever expected him to. It‚Äôs absolutely amazing. 

Still losing him is sad. He was arguably the greatest mind of the 20th century. 
$C: Yes. My uncle was diagnosed towards the end of 2010/early 2011 and passed away in the fall of 2013. It's a horrible disease that I would wish on nobody. 
$C: What was his illness?
$C: Completely agree. RIP
$C: He was a hell of an odds beater.
$C: He was the Einstein of our time. History will definitely not forget him.
$C: Truly one of the most iconic people of our era.
$C: I‚Äôm literally crying grown man tears at this

And I‚Äôm not ashamed.
$C: He died from what killed my grandfather. His wife said he wouldn't have been able to achieve as much if he was healthy. I respect that man.
$C: I read that he got a surprising amount of tail. 

His second wife left him because he was cheating on her with his nurse, for instance.
$C: While there are many great minds, I think it can be said that he was one of the most influential in his field and even beyond as a intellectual figure. As someone who at a young age had his physical health and regular life taken away from him when he was stricken by his disorder that caused widespread paralysis he's a testament to the sheer willpower that humans are capable of when they have a passion and skill. He'll forever be a inspiration to those faced with physical disabilities and anyone in general. 
$C: This is saddening being belief. But a random question: My wife who is studying DNR/DNI policy is really curious to the specifics of his end of life.  Any details outside of this article?
$C: He will be known for his work for the rest of mankind. 
$C: And he even had cameos on The Simpsons AND The Big Bang Theory!
$C: Honestly, congratulations to him for just living this long. That alone is a testament to not only how much technical knowledge and expertise that he had, but also the straight up determination to make it this far.


$C: Absolutely, certainly continued to contribute a lot in spite of his situation.
$C: All true, but what I don‚Äôt get is that he had an affair with his caregiver. 
$C: He's probably one of the biggest figures ever for the past century and been a huge part of pop culture.
$C: He was an exceptional man that will leave an exceptional legacy.
$C: Plus he was on Star Trek
$C: He was an inspiration to this generation- not just for his work in science but also for what he endured. He's a type of person that really only comes around once every few generations. The combination of intelligence and personal willpower that he had all these years is incredible.
$C: Can't help but feel like he finally is released from that existence though..
$C: Makes me wonder about the people not fortunate enough to get that extra chance. Who knows where we would end up if they all got so lucky.
$C: I think that him being so unique of mind and body, so different from all us, will definitely make him memorable. and his humor. He sure was a sharp one. 
$C:  Couldn‚Äôt agree more. This is an example of living for a purpose and wanting to learn and teach as much as possible.  I have so much respect for the man and the power of will.
$C: He was given an opportunity to be great. Used it well.
$C: Not in a long time.
$C: A lady I work with was recently diagnosed with ALS. I was talking to my sister this weekend about it and how Dr. Hawking had defied the odds by living so long with a disease that normally kills in a few short years. I just texted her this news and she called me a liar.

*Requiescat in pace* Dr. Hawking. Thank you for everything.
$C: It's never enough time when it comes to people like Hawking. 

He will be remebered for sure, but it's so sad to lose someone that contributed so much to the progress. People like this shape the future of the humanity!
$C: aint hawking considered the second most important man on history second just to Einstein? 
$C: Didnt he cheat on his wife with his nurse and then leave his wife? Theres a lot of stories of him being an asshole to his nurses and aides too.

He was a great scientist, but i wouldnt go as far to say i have nothing but respect for him. Just because youre extremely smart and successful doesnt mean you can treat people like that.
$C: He overcame all odds and lived as old as many healthy people even manage to live.  
$C: Yes it‚Äôs crazy that he took his prognosis and just continued on in life like nothing could stop him.  R.I.P.
$C: I didn't realize he had ALS. Be lived for so long that just doesn't seem possible. My grandmother got it and passed incredibly quick. It was so sad to watch.  It is mind blowing that I have always known stephen hawking as the way he was in the wheelchair
$C: Centuries if not decades from now he will be mentioned in the same regard as Newton, Galileo, Kepler, Einstein, Copernicus, etc 
$C: I'm sure that in later years he will receive the Nobel prize for Hawking's radiation 
$C: Silence. I don‚Äôt need anyone to talk for me, except this voice box.
$C: I feel the same way, even though we was told he was going to die soon, he still managed to live a long life helping us all understand our universe more. He will go down in history with all the greats minds. RIP, we shall never forget him.
$C: You are absolutely correct but I always hoped he could be the first one to make the leap from our meat suits to the singularity. 

I guess I saw him beat the odds and I just kinda assumed he'd be our first immortal. 


$C: I don‚Äôt get how he got gilded, twice, he‚Äôs not Stephen Hawking. 
$C: What an interesting guy. Does anyone have any idea about his views on death ?
$C: I‚Äôve said it once and I‚Äôll say it again NO BODY gives a shit.
$C: His memory will live on in the generation of peopke  he inspired to pursue a career in science, both as a brilliant scholar and also as a prime example of how greatness can be achieved regardless of how many obstacles you may encounter in life.
In my books, he is all the way up there with Carl Sagan as paragons of modern science and as leaders in our neverending quest for ultimate empirical truth, sense and meaning regarding the unfathomable wonder of the universe. 
$C: I... encountered him twice. 

Once, I was walking across Hobson Street to get to the corner of Sussex Street where Millers music shop is. I heard a noise behind me and turned around just in time to avoid being mown down by Professor Hawking in his motorised wheelchair. Jumped out of the way. I might have shouted 'Hey!'.

The other time, I was in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics in its old place on the Syndicate buildings site. It was a business visit. Again, I just heard in time to turn around and see the motorised wheelchair bearing down on me, and jumped out of the way as the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics whizzed past me.

So there you go. He was an insane driver.
$C: We still need him.
$C: I can't help but feel *something* wanted him here to complete his part in the universe after all the advesity he's faced in life. Always brilliant but being dead and brilliant doesn't forward humanity, so to have such a disease and live to 76 from such an early age of contraction is nothing short of a miricale at least and divine intervention at most.
$C: its sad but I dont feel bad for him. its not like he already didnt beat the odds a million to one. there comes a point for everyone when you just cant fight anymore.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I wonder if his criticism of Trump led to his death
$C: Incredible that he lived as long as he did
$C: He died on Pi Day, it can't be a coincidence to one of the greatest minds. Rest in peace.
$C: I hope he did everything he wanted.
$C: The first thing I told my SO upon hearing the news was "he can't be gone, he had more work to do!"

RIP Stephen Hawking, your books gave me a new worldview at a young age.
$C: A truly great man
$C: It's an interesting thing, really. He probably had an extremely long time to accept his imminent death, even though he lived way past what people would've thought. 

We can learn a lot about life with his story.
$C: Growing up, my mom said something along the lines of God crippling him so he couldn't spread lies through science. Ill have to ask her why God let him live such a long life to spread these "lies"
$C: He was diagnosed with ALS when he was about 21. He wasn‚Äôt even expected to live past 25. He is a very lucky man to live to the age of 76, and we are all lucky to have shared in his knowledge for such a long time. RIP 
$C: This just made death such a more calm thing for me. Wow. 
$C: Given his limitations it's amazing how much he was able to accomplish. 
$C: I'm so glad he got to experience zero gravity. 
$C: Let us all hope he fulfilled at least part of what he wanted to do first
$C: No question about it, this man did ten lifetimes-worth of work in just one.
$C: "I agree with that sentiment."  
  
  -Ridley Scott
$C: Like die on Pi Day?
$C: Also, "We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special." -Hawking

I like the feeling this quote brings me.
$C: He will do more for us from Heaven! 
$C: I‚Äôd like to believe that he was so strong in thought and action that the universe needed him to last as long as he did and discover what he did to add to the human consciousness 
$C: He did a lot of it, and the world is better for him.

That ain't bad.
$C: What a brilliant human being, rest in peace.
$C: How sad and yet incredible he lived 55 years longer than he was supposed to. We are witnessing a sad moment in history. It feels strange to be living historical moments
$C: You posted this same quote 9 times spread between 7 different subreddits.

You're a passionate man, I read it by chance 3 times already before I decided to check you out.
$C: Thank you for sharing that. It's a message we can all learn from.
$C: I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying. 
$C: Now it lies on all of us.  Where did he go?
$C: Phil Coulson said something similar this week on AoS. 
$C: I am glad he got to do so much for this planet, at a time when so many "important" people are doing nothing.
$C: look at this fucking loser he reposted this same comment in like 10 threads
$C: What a beautiful way to describe it. I've always fantasized about being immortal, but not for the sake of acquiring impossible amounts of wealth, accumulating power or even living thousands of lives. I just want to stick around till the end, whenever that could be, and see how far humans can make it. 
$C: This guy is just copy pasting this quote on all Hawking posts to farm karma. Downvote 
$C: Only a miracle of God allowed him to live this long /s
$C: I remember reading about his dream to experience zero gravity before he dies, makes sense for someone who studied physics all his life.

I'm so glad that he did manage to fulfill that dream in 2007.
$C: Such a great man, sad that I heard someone in the office saying "Stephen Hawking died, you know... the author of IT"
$C: When I read that he passed I had this weird hope that every mystery that he had not been able to solve was suddenly revealed to him. I feel like that would be a fitting end.
$C: I hope he did it all
$C: I hope that‚Äôs not me when I‚Äôm older. 
$C: Are you just posting this in every Steven Hawking thread you can find?
$C: Yes. That quote can give you karma. We get it. Such an original comment
$C: ```OH GOD. I DON'T WANT TO DIE. PLEASE NO. LOW BATTERY. LOW BATTERY.```

Stephen Hawking, later.

$C: Glad he wasnt afraid to die but being in no hurry to die and having much he wished to do doesnt fit this situation. Hes dead.

You couldnt find a more fitting quote?
$C: Seriously. Just one of those people who's gotten so old you would have never expected it. 
$C: Yea, came out of nowhere. Hadn't heard anything about any sort of failing health. One of the most brilliant men to ever live, RIP.

Edit: For people saying his health has been declining 50 years, of course he has. But imagine his health is like a graph. For a long time its seemed like a slow and steady linear decline. There hadn't been any news of it dipping down sharper recently, so this is (relatively) surprising.
$C: I was not expecting this at all

Great guy, amazing what you can accomplish even after being strongly limited by life.

RIP
$C: My roommate is an astrology/physics major and loves the man, I just told him and he sat down and responded like it was a parent or relative that just died. 

Edit: stupid typo, fuck astrology, I meant astronomy. 
$C: Same here.  With all the other ridiculous news today, this hits me the hardest.  I thought somewhat often in the back of my mind about how grateful I was that a person like Hawking was still alive and doing good for mankind.
$C: Damn social media is always a rollercoaster of emotions!

Pennsylvania election! Wow!
..scrolling..
Stephen Hawking has died. NO!!!
$C: Figured he would just live forever.
$C: I somehow always felt that, against all odds, he would just live forever. 
$C: Its so weird, I've expected this my whole life and I'm still shocked by his death. He survived so long despite his illness and always seemed to be in pretty good humor about it. He's truly one of the most inspirational people that have ever lived. 

Might be time to pick up a Brief History of Time again.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Same here. Came outta left field and no one was ready
$C: Me too :(
$C: Right? He seemed immortal. 
$C: Completely agree. I saw this and went ‚ÄúHoly Shit.‚Äù

One of the few celebrity deaths that have actually caught me of guard. 
$C: I was just thinking to myself yesterday, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe Stephen Hawking is still alive‚Äù.
$C: Me too. As a kid growing up wanting to learn about the universe and about Stephen Hawking. You never think man this guy might die in my life time. He seemed like he was going to figure out a way to live forever. R.I.P you beautiful soul and chair. 
$C: I'm still in disbelief at the news. Wow. 
$C: I read it on Twitch chat and thought it was trolling. But then I was sad to see it's actually true...
$C: Same. Was was it publicly known if his health had recently declined?
$C: Just heard of this news because a chick just yelled at a restaurant. It does feel out of nowhere.
$C: That's how it was for me, kind of like in a movie when all of the music slides down and out quickly like the air is sucked out of a room. What a man. 
$C: Honestly man, I got off Reddit like 15 minutes ago, got on again to procrastinate some more, and saw that headline.
$C: Same. Just opened reddit for some bored scrolling and I saw this at the top, and my gut dropped.
$C: Same. I felt my world just stop when I saw the headline. I never met him (only saw him speak once) but I feel like I've lost a distant friend.
$C: I never thought of the possibility of him dying, as odd as that sounds. In my head I‚Äôm like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs fucking Stephen hawking, how the fuck can Stephen hawking die?‚Äù a man who‚Äôs faced so many odds and impressed the world almost seems godly and immortal. May he Rest In Peace. 
$C: Yeah really. A friend of mine just texted me that he passed and I was actually so shocked. I got chills when I read the message. 
$C: I was just talking about him with my parents, this is absurd...
$C: ITT people who are expecting only certain people to die
$C: I refreshed the homepage and gasped audibly when I read the top three headlines on r/all. I am not usually jarred by things I see online, but yeah, it's not something you prepare to see.
$C: Meeeee toooooo
$C: Really bizarre. I was actually just thinking about him and his health the other day and how it's crazy he's still alive, which I've never done before. 

And now he's dead. He was a legend. !
$C: Yup. Open Reddit. Oh, god. Close Reddit.

Open Reddit. *Look at all the nice things people have to say.* Feel a little better.
$C: No other deaths of famous people shook me so much. It all feels so surreal seeing these posts on reddit. Nothing's changed in my life yet something tremendous has just happened. 
$C: I know :( I heard about it in Twitch chat of all places. Had to think it wasnt real at first. 
$C: When I first read the headline I quickly sat up in my bed, slowly took off my glasses and looked down and rubbed my forehead. It was the most stereotypical surprised reaction I could've had to the death of the least stereotypical of men. 
$C: Out with friends, was told this news, and had to quietly go home in tears. One of my greatest idols has left this Earth. Such is the cycle of the Universe. 

God damn this one hurt... 
$C: Yeah. It's a shitty morning for planet Earth.
$C: Weird, I drempt that he died last night. Woke up with no worries, because it was just a dream, and he'd live forever right? 

Fuck.
$C: Same here. Most well known people have some type of news article or build up that they‚Äôve fallen ill or something but Stephen just passed away. It‚Äôs just unusual that‚Äôs all
$C: I knew it was only a matter of time, but he still felt like a constant in life for some reason.
$C: I genuinely didn't think it was possible for him to die.
$C: Yeah, fuckin' hell...
$C: It‚Äôs weird. Even though doctors told him to say his goodbyes since he had maybe 2 years left when he was first diagnosed how many decades ago?
$C: Me too. Holy shit.
$C: For some reason this didn't even cross my mind as a possibility, despite the many medical issues the ALS can produce. I do believe that Hawking will be forever remembered in the annals of science, up there with Einstein and Newton.
$C: Same, I was casually writing a paper for class until the CNN notification slide across. ded
$C: Yeah, it really felt like he was never going to die.
$C: Yup. Opened reddit for some nice post dinner cat gifs, saw this instead.
$C: Same man. I just opened Reddit, half read the top post, closed reddit, then thought "wait, what the fuck did that say?" and opened reddit again and it just hit me like a truck. God damn...
$C: Me too, but isn‚Äôt it weird? Shouldn‚Äôt it have not caught us off guard given his illness?
$C: Prepare for that to happen a lot within the next 10 years.
$C: Me too :( when it popped up on my Twitter feed it had a visceral effect. 
$C: I didn‚Äôt realize he was that old.  Thought he was in his mid 50‚Äôs.
$C: Are we sure he's gone?  Did they try rebooting him? 
$C: Me too. I always looked upto him. A kid who hated math, couldn't even begin to understand the basics of physics, but he made it so fascinating, and even approachable to kids like me. Kids who were fascinated with space, and even more so by his discoveries.
$C: I gasped audibly when I saw this. Like other said, the idea that he could just be gone...I haven't been this shocked about a high-profile death since Steve Irwin.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Too soon. We still need him. 
$C: Same, for some reason I never expected him to die.
$C: Same. Didn't seem like he'd die soon. At least a couple more years. Oh well RIP
$C: Yeah, just hopped on Reddit, I‚Äôm young and he‚Äôs been here around my whole life and been a leader in all sides of science, and one day he‚Äôs giving a speech or something and the next he‚Äôs just gone. 
$C: My friends and I were talking about him like 4 hours ago. Just an hour ago, someone not even involved in the conversation says "RIP Stephen Hawking" and we all freaked out.
$C: So....2018 begins...
$C: Literally never thought I would see this in my lifetime 
$C: Can we just flood this thread with Hawking quotes? He has so many good ones. 

> "It would not be much of a universe if it wasn't home to the people you love."

> "Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change."

> "Life would be tragic if it weren't funny."
$C: Amazing that he got the time that he did, he will be missed 
$C: [deleted]
$C: That's some Dhammapada level stuff right there... 
$C: That‚Äôs a fantastic quote, but unfortunately, it‚Äôs source is not Stephen Hawking.

https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/07/20/knowledge/
$C: *Dr Hawking - the guy has a damn PhD
$C: All too relevant now, and forever. 
$C: Here‚Äôs one I like: 

‚ÄúIf aliens ever visit us, I think the outcome would be much as when Christopher Columbus first landed in America, which didn‚Äôt turn out very well for the Native Americans.‚Äù
$C: I had this read out in his voice. RIP
$C: Sounds a lot like Socrates
$C: In this day and age, that quote applies more than ever.
$C: It‚Äôs not what we don‚Äôt know that gets us into trouble, it‚Äôs what we know for sure that just ain‚Äôt so - Twain 
$C: [sad beep]
$C: How do I pin this quote to my RES, my email inbox, and my life overall?
$C: I can't find a reference that he actually said this quote... [Check this out](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/07/20/knowledge/)
$C: Quoted by someone who also said "As a teenager who's just started getting into politics I gotta say... this has been so fucking crazy to watch."

Such KNAWLEDGE!
$C: My wifi is named BaconCat69 - glad to know there's more of us.. üòÇ
$C: [deleted]
$C: Isn‚Äôt that pretty much what ignorance is?
$C: Interesting fact being that 14th March is Albert Einstein's birthday, and hours before on the 13th is Hawking's death.
$C: Man...RIP :'( dude got me into science.
$C: > The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge.

Well that and ALS. 
$C: He truly was an amazing man, the world has taken a big hit today. May his legacy live on
$C: I'm hoping he pulls a Jedi move and becomes much more powerful in death. In a world with dumb leaders we really need some smarts.
$C: Breaks my heart.
$C: ‚ÄúWomen. They are a complete mystery‚Äù

me too, steve
$C: At a time when we need intelligent thought most, unfortunately.
$C: Jesus, no! This can‚Äôt be! 
$C: This resonates so much for the present. Someone on Facebook said / my yoga teacher said / this bullshit article says "X" causes cancer / autism/ homosexuality and I just happen to sell an essential oil / pyramid scheme product to prevent it.
$C: I hope he detonated the brilliant brain of his to science 
$C: "We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special."
$C: Shame that with ignorance you tend to develop the illusion of knowledge.
$C: Quick! Everyone drop you favorite Stephen Hawking quotes! Lets get this thread hot with inspiration
$C: ‚ÄúTo confine our attention to terrestrial matters would be to limit the human spirit.‚Äù
-Stephen Hawking
$C: I can tell you have a boner just by reading your post 
$C: https://youtu.be/MqoANESQ4cQ 

This piece from the movie fits well in this moment. 
$C: You've got the top comment on a thread that will be seen by millions  of people in the next 24 hours.

Would you consider editing your comment with a link to a worthy ALS charity for people to donate to in honor of Hawking?

The ASLA is a good one: http://www.alsa.org/donate/
$C: Kind of crazy, just watching the interview with Tom Nichols on Opposition and he talks exactly about that (in reference to his book Death of Expertise), namely how people point at themselves and say they know more than an expert does (he goes into how there's a correlation between the less you know about something the more you think you know about it).

Show's pretaped so they didn't mention Hawking, but that would've been apt.
$C: Requoted from Socrates, I believe. Still a beautiful phrase, and one to live by.

At least now he‚Äôs free from that damned wheelchair. He did everything he could but I‚Äôm not sure humanity deserved him.
$C: Dr.

Dr. HAWKING 
$C: Not to be a jag given the circumstances, but the attribution of that phrase to Hawking would appear to be somewhat [dubious](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/07/20/knowledge/).
$C: ‚ÄúThis saying was attributed to Stephen Hawking by 2001, but QI has been unable to find substantive evidence that he actually employed it.‚Äù

source: https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/07/20/knowledge/
$C: Hot burn
$C: I mean, the guy did write a whole book on the philosophy of first contact even though he‚Äôs neither a philosopher or any kind of biology expert.
$C: Pretty profound statement. Veritasium did a video on it, because that was the creator's doctoral thesis: he found that if you just show a lecture video and test people's knowledge before and after, there was nearly no change because people already thought they knew the material and tuned out the lecture even though they clearly didn't. Then as a follow up experiment, he changed the lecture format to an interview. The host would ask scientific questions like those on the test and an actor would give wrong answers and then the interviewer would explain why its wrong. The test scores were noticeably higher. So people were being presented with info they thought was correct and then it was explained why it was wrong. That's why Veritasium videos are structured the way they are. 
$C: "I knew that. That's common sense! We don't need a physicist to tell me that."


$C: [Daniel Boorstin wrote ‚ÄúThe greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, but the illusion of knowledge‚Äù (Oftenmisattributed¬†to Stephen Hawking).

$C: He knew about "fake woke" people.

$C: "People who boast about their I.Q. are losers.". Rest in Peace Stephen Hawking
$C: A painfully relevant quote in our times. Thank you for sharing.
$C: This quote is so relevant in the era of Trump and the alt right.
$C: So much relevance of this quote in our nationalist/populist uprising right now in the Western world.
$C:  "Sorry losers and haters, but my I.Q. is one of the highest - and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your fault" - Donald Trump.
$C: >  Rest In Peace

Just got to hell for impiety. 
$C: I had no clue how old Hawking was, yet despite his condition he always seemed like a kind of immortalized human being. He didn't seem like a man who would ever die, but his death is a crude reminder that nothing lives forever.
$C: He seems like a staple of culture. He was just someone who exists. Never thought of him dying. 
$C: Right. I‚Äôm shocked. He just seems like those people that for some reason you don‚Äôt ever think of them being gone one day, like they‚Äôre always just there. Weird. 

Edit: Immortal! That‚Äôs the word I was looking for. Anyways RIP Stephen Hawking. I‚Äôll watch the ERB of you vs Einstein 
$C: I think it's because he became such a cultural icon you kind of stop associating him with an actual, 70 year old, person. Just a guess.
$C: My roommate just asked ‚Äúof what‚Äù

He should have died 50 years ago. 
$C: He always felt kind of ageless, like he'd always be around 
$C: It really wasn‚Äôt until reading the article that I realized people don‚Äôt live long with his illness
$C: My father had the same disease and made it 19 years when most people only get 2-4. We knew it was going to happen but we were all still caught off guard when it happened since he always pulled through, It‚Äôs been a whole year since he passed and I‚Äôm still not sure if I have processed it fully.
$C: In a parallel universe, he isn‚Äôt actually dead
$C: Agreed. It‚Äôs pretty strange. 
$C: No, that's exactly how a good person should think about someone. Who they are, what they love and what they do. Not what life does to them.
$C: Same here.  Despite having Lou Gherig's Disease, he seemed immortal.
Gods, I am going to miss this man!  He's been my hero for over 20 years. :'(
$C: Same. I think that since he was expected to die very quickly and was still alive after over 50 years, I expected him to continue alive for more time.

Also this was too sudden, we haven't got any kind of news saying that he was hospitalized or anything like that.
$C: Yeah my roommate was just completely freaking out . . . but he's 76 and has had a very serious illness
$C: Look up to the stars and he‚Äôs there. 
$C: It‚Äôs a miracle that he made it as long as he did. RIP.
$C: It's crazy that he lived for so long given his ALS, which is probably why I never considered that he would ever die too...kind of crazy.
$C: Same, I was wondering if it was one of those ‚Äúfalse alarms‚Äù that happen with Stan Lee

RIP
$C: I feel the same way... then it occurred to me that he passed on Pi Day.
$C: When you survive everything, dying seems impossible. 
$C: Stop deleting innocent comments for fucks sake
$C: He had too much to offer the world to leave us at an early age, despite having an awful illness. 
$C: Yes! His determination is so real and tangible I just figured death would come and he'd be like "nah"
$C: Life itself is an incurable terminal illness.
$C: Same here, he‚Äôs going to be missed. 
$C: Very well put. 
$C: No kidding, I mean... fuck. I guess we've been sort of up to date on his condition most of his life, but it seems sudden.
$C: Yah... You hit it right on... Just kind of thought he'd be here forever. 
$C: When someone is as impactfull as he is, it's almost like a super hero, we see them as a constant. 
$C: I had the same reaction. I didn't believe it for a second because it didn't seem like something that was even possible to me for some reason.
$C: I literally just had this conversation with my co workers.
$C: Yeah, he had been in the same state for years, seemingly not aging.
$C: I'll be honest. I've been wondering. But still, I just saw this news and was surprised somehow. It's like I expected it, but I didn't expect it.
$C: I guess we all kind of just expected his brain to be plug to a machine at some point becoming the first perfect human/machine hybrid.
$C: Im very surprised, i thought he'd still be around for a few more years. It didn't even cross my mind that this could happen surprisingly. 
$C: He will live on through scientific discoveries and memory.
$C: I don‚Äôt know why I thought he was immortal. 
$C: I thought so too. I think it might be because due to his condition, you never see him getting more frail- he's always like that. With other people you see them grow weaker or maybe all of a sudden they're so sick that they can't move and they need to get confined to a hospital, so people begin to expect their passing.
$C: Exactly what I  was thinking.
$C: Yeah, for some reason this is really hitting me.
$C: For me this just feels so sudden. Part of me kind of expected there'd be some news stories leading up to his eventual passing before it actually occured. 
$C: I feel the same.
$C: No it‚Äôs not strange at all, I always assumed if was gonna figure out multi dimensional immortality or something just as cool.


$C: Yeah, 76 is way beyond life expectancy for ALS (and 76 is on par with average LE) and 50 years more than the NHS expected him to live.  But still man, I thought maybe Death just plain forgot about him.  

The only person to play themselves in both Star Trek and Harry Potter.  What would he drink?  I feel like I should raise a glass of that to the stars tonight.  Scotch?  I'll go with Scotch. 
$C: I feel the same way. I sometimes forget my own age and my parents ages. But then something comes around to remind me just how much time has gone by or how much is left. 
$C: Absolutely.  It's almost like his infirmary made him invulnerable.  

I got a chance to see him give a laymen's lecture at Texas A&M in 2007.  Absolutely remarkable.
$C: the hypothesis is that he didn't actually have ALS but a similar disease -- ALS is continual degeneration, but his stopped at some point
$C: Right? That thought struck me the second I read the title.
$C: He lived for quite a while despite his illness. What a way to show he had a lot of fight in him 
$C: I literally just texted a friend ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe Stephen Hawking died‚Äù and they responded ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù And I thought ‚Äúoh... yeah I guess.. still though‚Äù 


Edit: texted* .. or maybe it should be text..
$C: I totally agree. He was one of those people that I thought would live forever Just because he already lived way longer than what he was supposed to. In my mind I put him next to Robin Williams, the idea of them not being on this Earth is just mind-blowing to me and makes me extremely sad. 
$C: dont worry mate, he's not gone,  just become one with thw cosmos. but seriously, i'm gonna missed this man big time
$C: You and many of us 
$C: I let out a verbal "NOOOO", like I was so shocked. Yet everyone knew he was way past his "expiration" date that you would expect from his disease. Odd how that works
$C: It certainly is surreal... like, he was unaffected, but pulled a plug...
$C: Not remotely weird. I said the same thing not moments ago to someone who asked why I looked so sad.
$C: I think I always thought he was too smart to die.
$C: You sound exactly like my patients in the ER when I ask them about end of life plans.
$C: He's beaten so many odds that I think we just kinda expect it from him.
$C: No, not to me at least. I feel the same way and am completely shocked at this. 
$C: Just another famous person that died before the Queen. How many more? 
$C: Right? Somebody like him you would think he'll live forever. 
$C: Seriously. I've been kind of numb for the last 30 minutes. I've paused a really interesting movie, fittingly about Time Travel, and I'm just reading about him and trying to process it. I never really thought he would be gone. I never knew exactly how much I admired him until right now. He's the first science figure I remember, honestly. 
$C: On Pi Day, of all days. Left this world with a joke and with the last laugh apparently.
$C: It always felt the same to me. I think it's because by the time most of us on here were born he was already the famously intelligent man and his illness had already taken all but his ability to communicate via robotic voice. So he was already kind of inhuman both socially and in mode of communication.

He obviously is a man to rise above all that life through at him. May he rest in peace.
$C: Same. I‚Äôm really bummed about this one. But also I think the world was lucky to have him as long as we did.

But I also can‚Äôt help thinking ‚Äúwell at least Bowie finally got in contact with ground control‚Äù. 
$C: Same. I shouldn't be surprised given his condition, but it was quite shocking to hear this news. 

RIP.
$C: I agree with this almost thought he was immortal I suppose 
$C: 76 is old for anyone.
$C: I am relatively young and the thought of all the influential figures in my life dying really bums me out. Everyone shown in the media and science communities that I have come to know and love will be gone in my lifetime. 
$C: I think no one expected him to die because he should have died so many years ago due to his disease, so everyone just assumed he wouldn't after so long when he just didn't
$C: I was watching futurama yesterday, and saw stephen hawking in the show and thought to myself... he‚Äôs still alive right? Started looking him up... pondering how strange so many celebrities that have died that he had essentially outlived despite his illness. 
Then the next day he dies. 
I hope i haven‚Äôt suddenly gotten a weird death note like anti-superpower where i think of someone, look them up, then they die... 
although that could come in handy... but then it leads down this weird spiral of me beginning to think i am a god, and going through this cat mouse game with someone trying to catch me... and its all too much of a hassle id rather sit here playing the sims. 
Oh shit they should make a deathnote sims expansion... that would be sick. 
$C: It‚Äôs because the man lived roughly an average human lifespan while having a terminal disease for most of it. That‚Äôs badass. 
$C: I was shocked as well!
$C: I think it's because his illness made determining his age by sight almost impossible. Not to be too disrespectful to the man, but he's looked like a human raisin for several decades.  He looked old for ages, which in a weird way made him appear ageless. 
$C: It's a miracle he outlived ALS for so long. Rest in peace
$C: That‚Äôs exactly how I feel. It felt impossible, yet but inevitable.
$C: Celebrity deaths don't often faze me... but this was a sucker punch. My kids are just toddlers and both are SO into science, and my son in particular has his eyes on the stars... it makes me very sad they won't get to grow up with any appreciation for him while he was still alive.

A great light has gone dim. 
$C: You‚Äôre absolutely right. It just never occurred to me either, and I‚Äôm sure the same applies to a lot of other people. Despite that illness, it‚Äôs still a shock.
$C: Despite his condition he always seemed to be larger than life to me.

He's done so much for the scientific community that he basically immortalized himself through his work and renown.

The fact that he died just like all of us inevitably will is almost surreal.
$C: I don't think it's weird only because I felt the exact same thing. I never thought he would go. How silly to think anyone invincible of death but somehow Hawking, to me, would outlive us all as he rightfully should've. 
$C: Yeah me too i will miss his guest appearences on The Big Bang Theory.
$C: exactly the same, I had a mini heart attack reading this on r/all, it just doesn't seem right for him to pass away
$C: I was surprised.  Now it seems strange to not be expecting it.

Sad. One of my favorite geniuses. Glad he got exposure on mass media like he did. Everyone should know him. Maybe some kid will do something great for it?

Also why I like these very very public billionaires like Musk, and Gates. Do good for humankind and hopefully people will aspire to be that kind of do gooder. 

Anyway, I am sad now.
$C: We started singing Bye Bye Mr. Science Guy. 
We drove the Chevy to the levy but the protons ran dry. 
That good ol boy studying black holes in the sky. 
Singing This will be the day that science died. Ya, this be the day that science died. 
$C: Death liked hawking. This has to have been a mistake. I'm going to double check
$C: A true inspiration for everyone.
$C: RIP Mr. Hawking - He is a true legend & brilliant physicist. 
$C: I shouldn't be, but I'm honestly shocked. Thinking about it, it's a blessing he lived as long as he did. RIP
$C: He did so much with such a huge restriction.
$C: imagine how much more he could have changed had he not been a prisoner in his own body. we need to do something about ALS.
$C: He will live forever in history. It's no doubt that his impact was enormously positive.
$C: He left a legacy few others will ever match. 

I love how he maintained a great sense of humor and a positive attitude, despite his decline in health. Rest in peace, champ.
$C: A way we look at the stars. His work on expanding general relativity was amazing.
$C: The way we look at the whole universe.
$C: Can I really PM you for bitcoin?
$C: He was probably the only actual living scientist the average person could name.   Now who's left?  Bill Nye?
$C: It hit me hard
$C: I still remember the dexters lab episode with him
$C: I just opened Reddit to see this at top/past hour... Was not expecting this... May he RIP.
$C: the average IQ of the world dropped by 10 points the moment he died. He will be missed and remembered through the ages.
$C: Einstein of the 21st century. 
$C: He was a man that truly changed the world and the way we look at the ~~world~~ universe.
$C: i think you might want to replace the last use of the word "world" with "universe"
$C: Not just the world; the whole universe. 
$C: Reminds me of a quote by Haley regarding Newton; "nearer the gods no mortal man may tread."
$C: Yup. Absolutely gutted by his death. For some reason it hit me as hard as the news of Robin Williams. 
$C: > the universe


He went way beyond the world 
$C: This man changed the way we look at the entire fabric of reality! :)
$C: He also changed the way we look at disabilities. 
$C: The world is not anymore the way it used to be! Mmm Mmm, no no no!
$C: a man who didn't let a disability get in his way when he had every right to relax or be bitter.  i don't think i'd have a will like that.
$C: Agreed. 


Check PM
$C: Feels like if I were around when Einstein died. Just doesn‚Äôt seem real being in the time that now doesn‚Äôt have him.
$C: I was so genuinely shocked at this one, and I'm not even really sure why. This just really, really jarred me for some reason. I guess I took him for granted :(
$C: It's like damn. Something you grew up with has disappeared so quickly 
$C: I really don't even want to believe it
$C: I scrolled by this and had to pause before I realized what I just read. Rip 
$C: My heart skipped a beat when I saw the headline. That‚Äôs a testimony to him and what he‚Äôs meant to this world. Rest easy. You‚Äôll never be forgotten.
$C: Yeah, it came out of nowhere. 
$C: Yeah, I literally just woke up and saw the news. I'm so sad now. Rest in Peace Stephen Hawking.
$C: I think it has a lot to do with his impact on humanity.  You don‚Äôt expect someone so impactful to die and when it happens it‚Äôs usually a shock. Its on the scale of a President dying. 
$C: I didn‚Äôt think it was real at first. I was scrolling Instagram, so not a news source at all, and saw ‚Äúworldstar‚Äù had posted it. I literally thought to myself ‚Äúthey need to fact-check before they post shit like this‚Äù

Hawking had lived for so long with ALS, so much longer than he was supposed to. I guess I just thought he would never *actually* die? 
$C: Yeah, saw it on facebook and knew it was a joke. Then I realized it was from BBC :(
$C: omg, amen
$C: Makes me feel old. It seems silly and obvious now because of his illnesses but I hadn't considered this as a possiblity.
$C: I'm only shocked because I thought he'd ascended to cyborg status. 
$C: My thoughts exactly, it's just something I simply can't comprehend. His legacy was inspiring and will be celebrated for years to come. Thank you Stephen.
$C: Yep. I'm in bed just casually browsing askreddit and then get to the front page to see what's up. 

I usually don't stay up this late on Reddit but here I am seeing really recent news of one of the greatest people to ever live pass away. 

I wish everyone the best and a good night's sleep (or day!) 
$C: He was definitely one of those people that would just seem to live forever. It‚Äôs odd‚Äîhe lived so much longer than expected and contributed so very much, but you always have to wonder how much more there could be. 

Particularly in times like these. 
$C: It was like he couldn't die.
$C: The man was an icon, and while we can accept people die, it's hard for us to except icons do
$C: I read this, looked away from my phone and said something unrelated to my roommate's, and then looked back and my jaw dropped. 

I did not expect to read that sentence today. Fuck
$C: Stephen Hawking in the afterlife, wonder how they mourn my passing?

> Damn, RIP üôè

...
$C: Just thinking about what he was able to do in his mind is absurd. How he was able to manipulate equations without being able to work them out on paper. Just crazy. RIP
$C: The average global IQ was just lowered a bit with his passing. 
$C: An inspiration too, ould have been so easy to far into the background but kept up his scientific contributions for decades instead 
$C: Physics fans everywhere are reflecting on their lives. A brief time of history was once summed up by a great mind of man. Why do I feel inexplicably sad? :(
$C: An absolute genius.
$C: Definitely in top 10 of all human history, past present and future 
$C: I'm not dead yet.
$C: Icon is a perfect word to describe this incredible person
$C: Man was a true legend. So sad to hear this news
$C: He‚Äôs an amazing inspiring person
$C: "Look up at the stars she like, honey where the roof?"
$C: Don't jinx Christopher Lee. 
$C: Considering that he was given just 2 years to live after being diagnosed with ALS in 1963, then proceeded to say "fuck that" and live a full and inspiring life up to the age of 76, he damn near *was* unkillable.
$C: Me and you both buddy. 
$C: Seems like it came out of nowhere, but the family probably would have understandably kept recent health complications private. 
$C: One of the most lively, engaging, generous people I knew was in a wheelchair due to Mini-/multi-core myopathy. You can take a person's body, but it's a lot harder to take their heart and soul sometimes.
$C: Still did a lot of work for the rest of us as well. Amazing life
$C: For a while now there's been some discussion by people about whether or not he was possibly misdiagnosed. People who have the illness get was diagnosed with technically don't live as long as he did.
$C: I will for the first time
$C: I was blown away by that book.  Need to dig it up.
$C: I have never read it and been wanting to get a copy on amazon. I have cosmos and the pale blue dot from Carl Sagan. Honestly I haven‚Äôt read either of them. Makes me sad. Life has been busy lately. I hope I can finish them before the end of this year. 


What other books would you recommend from either of them?
$C: Randomly, I just picked it back up last week. This gives me clear motivation to continue. 
$C: One of the very first book I ordered off Amazon at a young age. When it was quite known as a book store.
$C: First time I read it I was stuck in the first two or so chapters, I had to go back time and time again to understand it.


$C: 4D chess grandmaster Hawking
$C: Well, let's say he kept it at a draw. 76 is absurdly long for someone with ALS. 
$C: Best comment here
$C: Just wanted to point out, for the rest of us Brits reading who keep seeing "ALS", that it is the American colloquial term for what we know as Motor Neuron Diease - something we have always associated with Dr Hawkins.
$C: 5 and a a half decades. Man's a legend.
$C: The fact that he died at that age with a lifelong physical disability and died of old age rather than taking his own life not only shows the dedication towards science that he has, but also should be an example to all of us to pursue our goals no matter our hardships. 
$C: Yep, he inspired me to cheat on my wife and be a dick to my nurses and aides. 


$C: Right? I feel at such a loss. I'm praying to the science gods that somebody steps up to take his place.
$C: 76 incredible years. And 100s, 1000s more, stretching on into the horizon of time, that will be forever blessed by what this great man did and who he was.
$C: Yeah, With the effect he had on humanity, his legacy will last for years
$C: Part of me wants to believe he signed an agreement to be cryogenically frozen.
$C: I'd like to think that somewhere in the world there's a newborn who is just *real* curious about the world.
$C: This isn‚Äôt really a typical ‚Äúcelebrity death.‚Äù

He wasn‚Äôt some actor, or someone famous for being just famous. This was a man who dedicated his life to advancing what we know about physics and the universe around us. He was first and foremost a scientist. 
$C: Now know that you live in the "after" time. You once shared the earth with a person of immeasurable genius. 
$C: Today is Einstein's birth anniversary no less.
$C: Seriously. I never thought a celebrity death would affect me so much. I had pretty much assumed he was immortal at that point. So much for taking people for granted. 
$C: It‚Äôs actually Einstein‚Äôs birthday today. 
$C: Yes he will go down in the history books along with the likes of Darwin, Galalio, Newton, and Einstein. The world has lost a great man.
$C: Peace out.
$C: Physics undergrads represent. This fucking hurts, man
$C: As a biologist I haven't been hit this hard since Irwin (and Robin Williams too tbh)
$C: I remember reading an article a few years ago where current physicists were talking about the greatest physicists of all time. So many of them dismissed Hawking. They all seemed to fail to appreciate the effect he had on the common man. He inspired a generation in a way others never have. Brian Greene (a favorite of those featured in the article) may be brilliant. Maybe even more brilliant than Hawking. I'm not qualified to judge. But No way has his impact been felt as far and wide. It just struck me that all of these very smart people had such a narrow view. 
$C: Then it‚Äôs  your job to stand on his shoulders and reach even higher. That‚Äôs what he would want from the culmination of his work just as he stood on those who came before him. You got this. 
$C: Stephen Hawking is one of the reasons I got into science. He made me want to be a physicist. I‚Äôm graduating with my engineering degree this semester and have no idea where I would be without him. 
$C: Do good things. Tell your children they can bring us to the stars :)
$C: On the bright side, you will be carrying part of his legacy :)
$C: Same dude...same
$C: I recently graduated, but a similar thing here.

In high school we all wanted to be the next Newton, Einstein, Feynman, or Hawking. For the rest we'd have nothing more than history books, but with Hawking you could see for yourself what it meant to be a great physicist. 

But Hawking was great because he came up with his own ideas in his own way, just the same as the other greats. Keep going, keep learning, keep asking questions, just make sure that you keep doing it your way. I can't think of any nobler cause than to study the universe, so work hard and leave your own mark.
$C: Majoring in Physics was an idea I had few years back, inspired by him as well. An inspiring man, will not be forgotten in history
$C: Holy shit, I feel so bad for laughing as hard as I did. 
$C: Lol I bet he had a good laugh too or shock he seems like a good guy 
$C: paint this please
$C: ‚ÄúWhat a shitty kid,‚Äù 

-Stephen Hawking
$C: Yes, while I love this movie, a lot of parts were heavily exaggerated and dramatized so it‚Äôs not an accurate depiction. But an amazing movie nonetheless
$C: The extremely gifted composer for that movie, J√≥hann J√≥hannsson, just recently passed as well. I was listening to the soundtrack when I saw this headline :( Wonderful movie & worth the watch for sure.
$C: And while listening to the soundtrack, I just realized Johann Johannsson died as well, I got really sad. 
$C: I was just thinking of that movie and hoping that he and Johann are having a nice chat somewhere out there. 


$C: To add in to this. The composer of Theory of Everything, J√≥hann J√≥hannsson, passed away February 9th this year.

J√≥hann was one of my favourite composers.
$C: I‚Äôm due for a pretty emotional rewatch of this movie since the two best parts of it just passed within a month of each other.
$C: For sure going to rewatch this weekend and cry.
$C: Yeah, I could totally imagine this
$C: We didnt deserve him
$C: Felt like he said this very well, seems to be pretty fitting at the moment:

> We are each free to believe what we want and it is my view that the simplest explanation is there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realization. There is probably no heaven, and no afterlife either. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that, I am extremely grateful.

Lifted from his article on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking)
$C: Transcript of statement from his children, for the lazy:
>We are deeply saddened that our beloved father passed away today. He was a great scientist and an extraordinary man whose work and legacy will live on for many years. His courage and persistence with his brilliance and humour inspired people across the world. He once said, 'It would not be much of a universe if it wasn't home to the people you love.' We will miss him forever.
$C: Expected but too soon
$C: Hopefully, a statue is made of him in his honour.
$C: They forgot him before time travel was invented or they decided not to attend his party.
$C: Pretty sure if we ever invent some kind of FTL drive, they're gonna name it after him.
$C: And on Einstein's birthday, at that.
$C: Sure. I mean, he didn't contribute/discover anything close to what Einstein had. But go ahead an list it as a phenomena. 
$C: Well, I mean, if his family gave permission, we could still deliver Hawking's cremated remains to a celestial being.
$C: I'd almost guarantee that Elon Musk had Hawking as an inspiration... physics degree in that generation...
$C: I can think of several other people I'd rather see fired into space, but no one more deserving of the memorial. 
$C: Just never thought he would die in general. The thought just never occured to me for some strange reason.
$C: He lived way longer than he was estimated to live at he had a good life 
$C: To be fair, I think everyone, probably himself included, expected him to die a lot sooner. ALS is fucked up
$C: Your comment kind of contradicts itself, the world is brighter because of his life..
$C: A bit dram√°tico, he was a true genius, but thanks to him there are more now.
$C: We're all better off for him inventing the hawking radiations
$C: I just focus on it being brighter with having had his presence.  The world isn‚Äôt a darker place without him, it‚Äôs a better place because of him!  He truly left the world a better place than when he came to it, and that‚Äôs awesome.

$C: The intelligence of the world? What exactly are you talking about? Your average person does not know anything that Stephen Hawking was working on or could explain it. And they don't really teach the kind of stuff Stephen Hawking knows in grade school.
$C: John Von Neumann could arguably be one of the greatest after Einstein.
$C: Must have forgotten about Feynman 
$C: Can we like....not rank scientists and just celebrate his work?

K thanks
$C: That's a great point. He was very intelligent but if it weren't for other people taking care of him he would have died decades ago.
$C: Pretty confident he passed away at 1:59.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I hope so!
$C: Lmao you‚Äôre just saying this to get karma like everyone else in the thread
$C: Yep, he inspired me to cheat on my wife and be a dick to my nurses and aides. 
$C: This is great. I havent laughed in a long time. I am not sure how I feel now. 

He will be missed. Would be nice if we could send his ashes to Mars as the first human to land.
$C: This is great. I havent laughed in a long time. I am not sure how I feel now. 

He will be missed. Would be nice if we could send his ashes to Mars as the first human to land.
$C: That little smirk at the end of that line is the best part.
$C: Hawkings greatest legacy! Getting this guy laid!
$C: My mannnn!
$C: The tonal whiplash between your first and second paragraphs nearly stuck me in an ICU.
$C: And when you were done, her parents, brother and dog all clapped. 
$C: Of all things that never happened, that never happened the most. 
$C: He's been a kickass wingman to many throughout his life, I'm sure.
$C: I'm sure he would've gotten a kick out of that. He had an awesome sense of humor.
$C: Congrats on the sex
$C: Stephen Hawking, the wingman
$C: Soooo essentoally youre saying Hawking got you laid. 

THE LEGEND
$C: What a wingman.
$C: Hawking with the assist. 
$C: THATS WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT. Was it good?
$C: [deleted]
$C: Well uh, there it is.
$C: But was it good sex
$C: I hope this makes it to the top, best comment in this thread 
$C: You made it sound like you had a child with her.
$C: Thank Steven Hawking for getting you laid holy shit
$C: Hawking- the original wingman. 
$C: Sounds like a Barney Stinson scheme
$C: Great men set ideas and actions upon the world - but the true masters of history set the mood.
$C: First paragraph made me laugh. 

Second paragraph gave me the chills. 
$C: /r/jesuschristreddit 
$C: I actually am crying from laughing fucking hell üòÇ
$C: Can't believe you've done this
$C: Fucking /r/toosoon man, but take your damn upvote.
$C: I‚Äôm caught in a confusing state between grief and laughter.
$C: No u
$C: I'm kinda curious how long it took anyone to notice he was dead. I mean his body was already lifeless, so long was he gone before they realized it?
$C: god dammit...I laughed

but of course

*Anybody try just turning him back on again?* 
$C: https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubehaiku/comments/84aoy8/haikustephen_hawkings_last_words/ This dude stole your joke
$C: Don't really get this joke. He wasn't really defined by his computer, and I doubt the one he uses is even a Windows OS. 
$C: I literally just read your comment after I posted the same thing. What a loss 
$C: I feel the same way
$C: Hawking radiation settles that paradox, does it not?
$C:  He literally broke the game and then reinvented it. 
$C: Knew I shoud've min/maxed
$C: Too soon.
$C: He really was one of the greatest minds of our generation I am sure more will rise, but we lost a star.
$C: Makes you wonder if they'll "retire" the voice or if they'll use his voice to narrate science books and shows into the future given its uniqueness. 
$C: Probably not
$C: I'm a bit teary about it and I was having a perfectly good day.  Hope you feel better soon.

For now lets celebrate what an amazing life he led.

Welp I am an in tears.
$C: [deleted]
$C: the 76 gang?
$C: The actor actually damaged his back during the movie
$C: Good note? What timeline are you in? 
$C: Wasn't ready for it at all, but I remember now reading like 20 years ago that everyday he lived set the record for the longest with his disease. He really was an amazing man in all respects.
$C: Technically, IQ is not the ‚Äúbest‚Äù way to measure intelligence, it‚Äôs extremely hard to truly measure some ones intelligence from the large amount of ‚Äúintelligences‚Äù
$C: his iq was never measured 
$C: He left us with more knowledge than most. 
$C: perfect, I missed that. 
$C: I actually think Hawking died on the 13th. RIP
$C: Fuck thats true !
$C: Or a halfpipe
$C: He didn't believe in God though so...
$C: DrippingBeefCurtains is up to his old antics
$C: If there is a heaven, hopefully he won‚Äôt need one.
$C: That'd be fucked up.
$C: It's a little weird to think that he could technically still give speaking tours. All his work and his ideas can still be spoken by the voice he called his own. In that regard, I suppose he's immortal. 
$C: It's truly amazing how much he's willing to say with just you asking him to by typing it in to a computer.
$C: I will forever associate Microsoft Sam with him.
$C: Holy Shit...... ‡≤†_‡≤† 
$C: I admit, I laughed.


Then I shed more tears ;-;
$C: My favorite version.
$C: Thank goodness we live in an age where science is (mostly) respected and celebrated. We can stand on the shoulders of giants.
$C: >What a life. 

Yes , he is an inspiration for everybody . Legend

$C: [deleted]
$C: My gut tells me this was probably fake. 

Don‚Äôt forget that Hawkins is pretty much only famous for predicting the end of humanity every 6 months or so. It would kill him (no pun intended) to know he died before he could witness the end of humanity. 

Take him out of the chair and he is as ordinary as most of us. Still sad he died though. 
$C: He was never supposed to make it to 30, even. They gave him 2 years to live with ALS...in 1963.
$C: Definitely.  This is a man that will be in history books for thousands of years.  Such an accomplished person.
$C: That is some dark ass irony there
$C: Einstein and Hawking both lived to 76. Hawking's life was 30 days longer.
$C: Beautiful words
$C: How on earth could he have been one of the greatest?? LOL 

$C: Einstein's B-Day
$C: Kanye is still alive fam
$C: Is that a pun? I don't get it
$C: Bertrand Russell wasnt a scientist.
$C: Stephen Hawking absolutely deserves the respect he's getting and he'll definitely have a lasting impact on science but honestly you couldn't compare him to Einstein or Newton. 
$C: the first true AI put into a robot and it has to die on us.
$C: Nelson Mandela was bigger. But you‚Äôre right.
$C: Lmfao nonsense. Unless by immeasurable you mean too small to measure. What did he contribute and would anyone care if he did it standing up?
$C: We got Elon Musk now... 
$C: No , the death of Tom petty ...  
$C: It's breaking news. Should be up in the next few minutes. 
$C: The Queen's next
$C: He hypothesised that, contrary to contemporary theory, black holes also emit energy and can ‚Äòdissipate‚Äô away. The energy they emit is now called Hawking radiation. One of many theories he developed. 
$C: I learned about it in r/politics so don't feel too bad. 
$C: One of my favorites, thanks for the reminder
$C: I never saw that before - thank you very much
$C: well, i've heard there's a Tesla on the way to Mars with a free seat...
$C: *There's a silence surrounding me...*
$C: How the hell did he write a book??
$C: Thanks for sharing!
$C: Twist, Stephen Hawking died on a skateboard.
$C: He also wanted to see alpha centuri ! alas !
$C: If I ever lose any physical abilities, I hope to have the mindset and motivation you do. The world lost a brilliant mind today =(
$C: Will there be an afterlife afterparty after the end?
$C: You think he wouldn‚Äôt do that 
$C: Radio 1 for you! Capital is where it‚Äôs at
$C: How could he possibly be one of the greatest?? Explain to me his accomplishments. Cause he didn't do anything to be warranted as one of the greatest. 
$C: Did he do anything for PI or am I missing something? He is a pretty average mathematician compared to his commercial cosmology knowledge. 
$C: No one cares. And its not "uni". This is an American website. Call it university. Maybe we will let you immigrate someday. 
$C: That sounds like something Stephen would want. But his body would decompose long before it ever got there.
$C: I dunno man, there are a lot of redditors in their 80s with a raging nostalgia boner for that Elvis chick.
$C: But Kanye is still alive 
$C: This is happening far too often

Whom else should we ponder about now üòè
$C: You thought he was a robot?
$C: this is like the least eloquent way you could say what you're trying to say but i can tell its genuine
$C: What about McClovin?
$C: Okay, since you asked so nicely

$C: It was top for about 10 hours I think
$C:  > 76!

76! = 1.8854947016660506e+111


$C: Yes. Socialize the cost of development and privatize the profits. 
$C: > Does anyone know if he ever retired?

How does someone with that mind ever turn it "off" - does not compute
$C: I disagree, very sad he passed away; but rather smashing it was on Pi Day
$C: bad movie 
$C: hopefully he has a harddisk or server with everything documented down . =)
$C: Yeah it sucks living like that i know 
$C: guess who was born today, in 1879
$C: Not quite Kanye but he was close.
$C: Died just before pi day
$C: Can‚Äôt forget Steve Irwin. Or maybe that‚Äôs just me...
$C: I mean, he beat his disease. He died at 76. That's basically the life expectancy for a healthy man. To have cultivated the genius he did while suffering through something most will never understand is remarkable. 
$C: Role model? He was a fabulous scientist, but I don't consider him a role model.
$C: thats soon
$C: This seems common in history, doesn't it? Who knows, maybe his void has already been filled with some random child.
$C: Elon will do that
$C: It's the 'turning back on' bit that we haven't figured out yet.
$C: I don't know -- Albert ripped holes in Hawking bigger than the hole in his black hole theory was...
$C: a little before 
$C: Please show me any proof of this. As far as I know, Hawkins was loved by everybody.
$C: You sir are a fucking idiot, calling the_donald the KKK headquarters.  Let us not forget who supported a known KKK member for years, very recent years, that would be the democrats. 

Leave your hate outside.
$C: He did.
$C: 3.3333333333333333333.... miles away?
$C: Yeah, unfortunately 
$C: Woke up in the past.
$C: /r/randomlyplacedcommas
$C: Here's a basic list in no particular order:

He was one of the first to theorize that black holes were finite and evaporated over time, and was incredibly important in creating the mathematical proofs for it. This is why the radiation black holes emit while they decay is called Hawking Radiation. 

He was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by both general relativity (large scale space physics) and quantum mechanics (small scale space physics). 

He postulated that the event horizon of a black hole could never get smaller, which would later become known as the second law of black hole dynamics, and he later disproved his own law with Hawking Radiation.

He discovered the laws of black hole mechanics, helping to connect the dynamics of a black hole to known thermodynamics.

He's one of the youngest people to be elected to become a Fellow of the Royal Society.

He posited that information is irretrievably lost when it enters a black hole, which violates a fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics and led to years of furious debate which still continues to this day. All the way up to 2016 he was working with others to find a solution to this apparent paradox.

He helped publish what would become known as the Hartle‚ÄìHawking state, which was a new model for the big bang which posits that (note that this is incredibly simplified) it's incorrect to view the big bang as a "beginning" as time did not exist at that moment, it would be more like the north pole on a globe, a point where you can't go any further north. Not a beginning, but simply where all lines and paths spread out from.

He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire.

And many other things. You can look this all up on Wikipedia if you want the full rundown.


$C: >>His passing has left an intellectual vacuum in his wake. But it's not empty. Think of it as a kind of vacuum energy permeating the fabric of spacetime that defies measure. Stephen Hawking, RIP 1942-2018.
>
>Neil Degrasse Tyson 
>
>Vacuum... Ener... What the hell man.


Uhhhh, scientist shit dude... 
$C: No.  Don‚Äôt be lazy
$C: He is somewhere good, and he is most pleasantly surprised!
$C: His death doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt try to understand the universe
$C: If you do, look at mounts carefully. They are as if not more important than the telescope itself. 

Even a small telescope, with good alignment, and semi modern sensors (dslr or the more expensive "ccds" (which are usually not ccds, but cmos sensors)) will give results that are visually nearly as good as some of the best pictures from the 1990s (excluding Hubble) 

Good luck, and take a look at r/astrphotography and r/telescopes 
$C: Because we are getting older.

$C: And Albert Einstein's birthday, too!
$C: Also Albert Einstein's birthday!
$C: How the fuck is one of your inspirations an investor? All the others are scientists. Elon musk is an investor and marketer. 
$C: No, he died on Pi Day.
$C: Um, let me introduce you to a newfangled concept called google mate then you can mourn with the rest of us
$C: At the height of his fame he body slammed the 500lb monster Andre the Giant at Wrestlemania 3, in front of 93000 screaming Hawkamaniacs at the Pontiac Silverdome in Detroit.
$C: Nice, its like comparing a Lambo to a Mazda. Whats the point in comparing?
$C: His family should be in charge. 
$C: 4 years ago
$C: Yea the queens been 80 for like 20 years now what's up with that...lol

$C: You probably wouldnt of taken them to either because you aren‚Äôt important at all 
$C: Not an MJ fan i see 
$C: Steve, Robin Williams and now Hawking. All of those suck : (
$C: Considering IIRC doctors said he wouldn‚Äôt live past his early 20s, yeah, he held on for a while.
$C: Ice bucket challenge money bro 
$C: as old as the universe
$C: He outlived his prognosis, most people with his condition dont live for more than a handful of years. He was always on borrowed time.
$C: Plus, he died on Albert Einstein's birthday.
$C: I thought ur joke was funny...
$C: You‚Äôre actually trolling right?
$C: Wowie no sense of humor on Reddit big surprise

$C: I don't see why everyone is disliking this comment, I think it's a pretty cool thought. The stars and space were his life, I too hope he got the chance to see them one last time before he went.
$C: Or maybe he shit himself as he died, like people generally do.
$C: Rolled outside to watch the sunset to a swelling John Williams orchestra chorus, closed his eyes and became one with the force; leaving his empty chair behind (because he's not a hack like Rian Johnson).

$C: More important then you 
$C: Dude has a form of radiation named after him. He wasnt without insights.
$C: I think you just dont understand why he actually did.
$C: You can't be intelligent and be an atheist. Agnostic yes , but not atheists.. Christian or religious yes , you can be smart and intelligent if you are religious because that's having faith admitting not based on fact . But to have faith in not having faith is beyond dumb ..

$C: Agreed he was kind of a smug prick as well

That's how reddit works, someone will always be the first person to post.
$C: [deleted]
$C: That‚Äôs kind of screwed up to say about a guy that didn‚Äôt believe in your god.  
$C: Was Hawking not a believer in God?  I might have him mixed up with other great scientists, but they always seem to be believers in God.  As an atheist, I always admired that view.  It makes sense to a degree.  Maybe God didn't create us, but maybe God set the wheels in motion that did.  I thought that was Hawking's view.  At any rate, rest in peace.

Godspeed Mr. Hawking...you can cruise the cosmos now unimpeded. 
$C: Google his children released the statement 
$C: He was married at one point so, no I think not. 
$C: Fuck off with your Christian bs. Cant you be respectful of what he contributed to humanity despite his illness?
$C: dude stfu
$C: That because the only way someone as small minded as you can fathom the universe is if a being like a God created it.
$C: No need to suck Yahweh's cock so much 
$C: Where do you fucking ignorant retarded Christians come from? The way you assholes describe your god is a dictator. So basically you're saying he's Kim Jong Un. It's just mind blowing how ignorant you dumb mother fuckers are. I hope there isn't a god just so people like you disappear into nothingness when you die. 
$C: He only believed in things that were fact brought to him and tried to expand all of what humanity knows about the universe we live in. If there is a God and He sent Hawking to Hell then I‚Äôll gladly go to Hell with him. Since a God that would send Hawking to Hell for that is no God at all, just a cruel joke. 
$C: I have a genuine question. How can you act like you follow the teachings of Christ, and be so hateful in the same statement? Do you not see the hypocrisy there? Even the Catholic Church and the pope himself accept many modern day scientific facts. If you actually believe in the words of the Bible, you‚Äôre not only a fool, you‚Äôre also making a terrible example of Christians everywhere.
$C: Careful now, don't cut yourself on that edge. 
$C: Ugh, people die every year. It's not exclusive to each year.

$C: Sorry to burst the bubble, but I mean how lucky you are to have lived at precisely the right time in history, to be born to a family that just so happens to worship the one and only god that is the right god...I mean you could have been born at some other part of the world such to worship Allah, and be claiming he is the only real god... Or how about being born in a time when Zeus was considered as being the all mighty god(don't forget to thank the others for their contributions). That you managed to follow one of over ten thousand different religions, and that your one out of over ten thousand gods that have been imagined... That you have the one and only real god....

$C: Idk but after learning that he's my hero. I'm sure he did other cool things in his life also
$C: Who wouldn't want to party with Hawking? Those time travelers missed out
$C: How do you know they stood him up...
$C: They better not, based on a recent reddit showerthought saying that time travelers from the future would bring pathogens that current humans' immune systems wouldn't be immune to, killing us all.
$C: Maybe this is another trick and he's trying to catch time travelers at his funeral, but then they don't come and he's actually dead :( 
$C: Stan... naw I'm gonna leave that be... 
$C: i was just thinking about this today and thought that his idea was good but was just to prove time travel is impossible.

but lets be honest what are the chances that the information this party took place will live on long enough that if time travel would ever be a thing people would know about this?

if someone would be dead serious about this he would need to do this like once a year and get huge media coverage about it so even have the slightest chance that the information could make it to a time where we have time travel.
$C: Thats just for the first time line.

That also means we are also all part of an original time line.

So eventually when they do invent time travel in the future, they will have a chance to travel back in time. 

It just hasnt happened yet, even though the future with time travel makes that theoritically negligible, its also about how it still has yet to happen which means we still have a timeline to play out before it is actually changed.
$C: Time traveller here, can confirm... His party was on point 
$C: im pretty sure its because the time travellers (if they do exist) never knew about the party in the first place.
$C: That's the phrase you're going with for a paraplegic?

Hot dang
$C: They probably didn't but you can't just tell everyone the future
$C: But, if he was able to stand up, the party was a big success!!!
$C: Standing him up, eh?
$C: That was really kind of them
$C: John Titor needs to come save us from this world line
$C: But the time traveler knew the party sucked so why go there? They have a full time finding young Hitler, Mao, Kissinger and other war criminals so they can change history.
$C: My buddy has a time machine. He lets me use it sometimes. I go in on Friday. I come out. It's Saturday. The whole thing takes about a day.
$C: *technically* anytime you move, you're time-travelling. When you're on a plane, you're actually like 0.1 seconds ahead of time compared to everyone who is standing still on Earth. Which means, if you got a faster plane and stayed on it in full motion for 10 years, when you get out of it, 12-15+ years would have passed for the people on Earth, which would mean you effectively traveled about 5 years into the future

"I regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail. There is no heaven or afterlife for broken down computers; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark." - Stephen Hawking
$C: Nope.....we dont, we call them time travelers. 

$C: to me it is like placing 100 mirrors reflecting one another.  The 1st mirror is reflection of me typing the letter "S"..2nd through 100 mirrors are reflection of previous mirror in order. Because the speed of light the person viewing the 100th mirror is actually seeing me type a split second after the actual event...while the person viewing the 2nd is viewing the future as compared to the person viewing the 100th mirror.   viewing Time travel.
$C: /r/iamverysmart
$C: Especially considering no one has ever lived that long with ALS, as far as I know. I think there are theories that his disease is something different because he lived so much longer than expected and because the onset was earlier.
$C: considering he was supposed to be dead by 30, he lived a long life
$C: 76 years old is a pretty damn long life... especially one with having a chronic illness.. it is pretty impressive he lived that long!!
$C: excellent, considering
$C: 76 is probably average for white males, but honestly it‚Äôs still too soon. Retirement is around 65 in a lot of places. That‚Äôs like 10 years of resting...
$C: I think that it's amazing that not only was he one of the most brilliant minds of all time, but also the fact that he was able to live such a long and productive life and do so much despite the fact that he could barely even move.
$C: Einstein was also 76 when he died and he didn't have ALS. It's truly magnificent how much time Hawking had.
$C: he looks younger than 76 because the person youve been seeing is a lot younger than 76. Steven Hawking died back in the late 70's, he has been replaced twice by patients with advanced ALS the same as the original Hawking had. 
$C: that's true, he wasn't bald or wrinkly so it's hard to tell how old he was, he just always looked like he was in his 50's.
$C: Wonder if NASA and ST: Discovery will name a ship in his honor.
$C: I love this guy's sense of humor
$C: He looks so happy too.
$C: When I was growing up, my stepmom‚Äôs stepfather looked just like Data and I mean JUST  like him. It used to blow my mind bc I thought he was actually Data. 
Turns out he wasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôd post a pic but I‚Äôve been on no contact with them since 1998. Religious fucking fanatics they were. Plus that whole family is a bunch of sociopathic lunatics. Just thinking about the things they did makes me rage. Fuck that family. 

Sorry, got carried away. 

RIP Good sir. 
$C: Yes. From TNG
$C: Also thought it was going to be Dexter's Lab, surprised I had to look this far down. 
$C: The reason he never upgraded his voice was because he felt that was his voice.
$C: >  technology can immortalize him by continuing to use his voice.

Hopefully that doesn't just mean using his voice to sell shit.
$C: It's the Mac "Fred" voice. 
$C: I never thought about the possibility of him upgrading his voice, but I guess that's kinda the point. It was his. Cool perspective.
$C: Fun fact: Stephen Hawking passed away on the same day and month Albert Einstein was born (March 14th).

I'm not implying anything but... Consider that the man we're talking about spat on the face of reality by refusing to let the illness take the best of him. THEN he made breakthroughs on something that distorts time and space via gravity so drastically that many hypothesize it could allow time travel -- gravity and time being the field of study where Einstein made his breakthrough........

I'm just kidding but still, what a gem was lost today :'(
$C: I wonder if they will section his brain for museums as well?
$C: Well; what was is like?
$C: "Well son, we had Hawking, AND a stable genius leading the country."
$C: Well, he did some super cool physics stuff, but then he wouldn't stop talking about time travel and hostile aliens. Not that I'm complaining.
$C: Not to take away, but Carl Sagan felt like the big science figurehead up until his passing. It's not that Sagan was any more important or relevant than Hawking or Einstein, it's just that Sagan was involved in so many projects that moved humanity's exploration of outer space forward. 

Hawking was well-covered and present throughout the rise of the internet and meme-culture, including pop-culture references in Family Guy, Futurama, and many other venues. 

I'm glad Hawking got the exposure and attention that he did - with more of a focus on his ideas rather than his disabilities. His contributions to science at all levels of complexity will be legendary and I hope the next generations of Hawkings are currently hard at work following in his footsteps, inspired and driven by the work he contributed to. 
$C: I don't wonder what it was like when Einstein was alive, what are you talking about?
$C: [deleted]
$C: This one digs deep. 
$C: I wish I had the competence to get to his level and make a difference. 
$C: Yep, he inspired me to cheat on my wife and be a dick to my aides. Now who can i look up to?
$C: Seriously.. I googled his name when I heard he died, and the "people also search for" box was

Einstein, Newton, Galileo, Tesla, and Sagan
$C: Probably not that much that affects your daily life, but a lot that affects our understanding of the universe we live in and how amazing of a place it is. These are more existential contributions than inventing a blue LED, and not as immediately useful from a technological standpoint, but they enhance our understanding of the universe.
$C: Sir Isaac Newton gets my vote on that front. But he‚Äôs one of the greatest of the last century for sure.
$C: You're right. In a time where we desperately needed a mind like his, nonetheless.
$C: Why would you say that? Shouldn't the greatest mind of all time be someone like Einstein?
$C: This line of thinking also helped him with his work on physics. He submit a paper about black holes, and later came out and admitted that he was wrong and had to make corrections. 

That is something seemingly rare in this day and age. He was willing to sacrifice his own pride to help move physics along and help humanity to develop a better understanding of our universe. 
$C: What do people say about his personal morals? He seemed like a really decent dude.
$C: Yeah IIRC he would even include jokes about himself in interviews. Didn't he also voice himself on Family Guy or something as part of a gag? And I think his appearance on TNG included some jabs too, though its been a long time since I watched it.
$C: Never forget the one time on Last Week Tonight when John Oliver interviewed Stephen Hawking and Hawking shat on him for damn near the entire interview. Absolute legend.
$C: > nobody can deny that dude had a sense of humor about it

He was really funny. Wish he had done some standup... wait
$C: Personally, my favorite Hawking quip was when someone asked him ‚ÄúSo, is there a universe where I am smarter than you due to infinite universe theory?‚Äù And he replied ‚ÄúYes. And one where you‚Äôre funny too.‚Äù
$C: This just reminded me of dexters laboratory professor hawk for some reason. 
$C: just to give you an idea of how smart he was, he was able to get the nuanced humor of rick and morty.
$C: "I call it a Hawking Hole."
$C: Not trying to be rude, but maybe you should consider meeting more physically disabled people. Speaking from (limited, biased) experience, most adults have a positive mindset about their limitations, and an open mind about poking fun about it.
$C: Damn I can only hope to have an inkling of the strength this man showed in his life. RIP
$C: His sense of humor is what got me interested in his work.
$C: His appearance of  the big bang theory was dope. 
$C: His morals really weren't that bad, he just sucked as a husband and was an atheist.

No need to drag on this propaganda about evil scientists that began with Charles Darwin who for a man of his time, had amazing morals. This bullshit social Darwanism theory has nothing to do with Darwin's work and was a perversion by capitalists (who are oddly not looked at as evil although Darwin is). Darwin was against slavery and was devastated by the death of his daughter, which is part of the reason he decided to publish his theory which he had been sitting on for 20 years.
$C: What personal morals?  

Real question. Why are they worth mentioning?
$C: I mean this with the utmost respect. The man had a rad sense of humor:

$C: Didn't even show a reaction. 
$C: He could certainly roll with the punches.
$C: "Strided", the way that rolls of the tongue is...unpleasant.
$C: I‚Äôm a civil engineer and I would be honored to build an ADA stairway to heaven for him 
$C: I agree. A person and mind we will tell our kids about.
$C: Considering he was told he had two years to live when he was diagnosed and he managed to essentially say "Fuck that" I'd say it was pretty fulfilling indeed. 

Definitely a good role model for those of us with disabilities. 
$C: Hell, the man was the most celebrated scientist of the 21st century, that's a more fulfilling life than just about everybody
$C: If I remember a documentary about him, without the ALS he would not be who he was. The fact that he was trapped in his own mind allowed him to think outside of the normal
$C: One of the most iconic human beings of our era. He will definitely be missed.
$C: >He probably lived the most fulfilling life you can live given his circumstances  
  
Under any circumstances, really.
$C: Dude had more women that most redditors will ever dream of and he was in a wheelchair his whole life.
$C: Of all the lessons in physics he taught us, I've always thought that his enthusiasm for life was the one to learn from most. His condition was incredibly difficult but he truly made the most of what he still had. Incredible guy.
$C: Hell, 76 is a decent age for a non-terminally ill person. He‚Äôs right in the ballpark of average lifespan. 
$C: He probably lived a more fulfilling life than most healthy people. 
$C: Truly and inspiration to all. I hope he's remembered up there with Newton and Einstein.
$C: He lived the most fulfilling life anyone can live. He'll join the ranks of Newton and Einstein.

All this despite having such a debilitating diagnosis.
$C: He lived a more "fulfilling" life than the average individual with a very healthy and able body. 

People can take this however they want, but this thought motivates me to try harder at school/work/life
$C: Absolutely. The guy was diagnosed with a disease that usually kills people, or at least limits them to a life that many would consider not worth living, and continued on for 40+ years. He was like a guy on his last $10 at a Blackjack table that continued to successfully double down despite the dealer being on a hot streak. Rest in peace Dr Hawking. 
$C: He is in the top .1% of the world when it comes to the influence he's had. Amazing, amazing life.
$C: Compared to those who have few disabilities and set backs like this, he lived a VERY fulfilled life that most would not pursue.
$C: Meanwhile, my neighbor is on permanent disability because she has "a bad arm" at age 25. 
$C: Yah, cheated on his wife and divorced her for his nurse, then divorced the nurse...also was a regular at several strip clubs...
$C: Fulfilling? 

Idk, man. 

I think he faced obstacles that would be pure torture for most. 

Read up on his nurse's allegation about his last wife, it's awful. 

Actually? It's even worse considering he was seen to have large sense of pride. 

RIP to him, he has gone through obstacles I can't even dream of surpassing. 
$C: Homie out-lived the doctors who told him he'd be gone in 2. Now if that's not a fuck you I dunno what is. 

On a serious note though, we always say that immortality is impossible but Hawking's teachings, theories & discoveries will ensure he lives so long as the human race is in existence. RIP. 
$C: 1963 + 2 years = 1965

Naaaa... Screw that how about 2018
$C: In a world where the good die young and the shittiest people live for an eternity

This mother fucker lasted *waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay* longer than he should have. And the world was better because of it
$C: Hell, I was born in 64. He was sick with this longer than I was alive.
$C: Yes.  Yes it does.
$C: He was a superstar physicist with the popular appeal of Feynman a generation ago. His contributions to astrophysics are unfathomable. 

Can you imagine defying the worst odds and working on concepts that even some of the smartest men would scratch their heads over? 

The sheer scale and importance of his work is very difficult to gauge. What a man.
$C: To be fair, his borrowed time ended up lasting 55 years, which many people can't even reach in a normal lifetime.
$C: He was very influential to me though we are it different scientific fields (I'm Ecology/Evolution). His love of the universe, passion for the greater understanding of how it all works and drive despite his health issues were and are incredibly inspirational. I will miss you, Dr. Hawking. May you rest easy.

For those who want more info:

Dr. Hawking is well known both in the scientific community and the general public. As a fairly controversial figure he has been a positive voice in favor of manned space travel, a staunch atheist, a concerned voice about future AI, and a shining light on astrophysics in general. He will be greatly missed within the scientific community.

Dr. Hawking was a prolific author of books for the layman, if you are interested he wrote the following:

* *A Brief History of Time*
* *Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays*
* *The Universe in a Nutshell*
* *On The Shoulders of Giants*
* *God Created the Integers: The Mathematical Breakthroughs That Changed History*
* *The Dreams That Stuff Is Made of: The Most Astounding Papers of Quantum Physics and How They Shook the Scientific World*
* *My Brief History*
* *The Grand Design*

He and his daughter have also written several children's books. [For a complete list please see their website.](http://www.hawking.org.uk/books.html)

A movie version of his life was also released in 2014 titled *The Theory of Everything*.

ALS or Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is also known in the U.S. as Lou Gehrig's disease after the baseball player. [According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Amyotrophic-Lateral-Sclerosis-ALS-Fact-Sheet):

>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a group of rare neurological diseases that mainly involve the nerve cells (neurons) responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement. Voluntary muscles produce movements like chewing, walking,¬†and talking. The disease is progressive, meaning the symptoms get worse over time. Currently, there is no cure for ALS and no effective treatment to halt, or reverse, the progression of the disease.

Dr. Hawking was diagnosed at 21 and not expected to live passed the age of 25. [Only roughly 10 percent of ALS patients live more than 10 years.](http://www.medicaldaily.com/stephen-hawking-oldest-als-survivor-physicist-has-defied-odds-407864)
$C: I think this is beautiful. I may have to borrow this but I'm going to change it slightly to "He achieved more on borrowed time than most could achieve in ten lifetimes." because lets face it, he was that amazing.
$C: Exactly my thoughts. Makes me sad thinking about all the times i ( and everyone else apparently) laughed at his cartoon adapations.. ex. G.U.M.
$C: With the personality to match. He was just so charismatic and colorful. 

Fun fact: Every time he appeared on The Simpsons, he did so literally. While the studio could have created his dialogue using the artificial voice, they insisted he come in and record. Makes his appearances all the more special IMO. 
$C: And he lived to be 76 with ALS
$C: But don't worry about him, he's f-

Oh wait, never mind.
$C: That‚Äôs.... not true....
$C: Yes, in that he had the same impact in the public mind as Einstein.

No, in his actual impact on science. Hawking focused on a couple of niches around black holes. Einstein had much more wide ranging and fundamental contributions. You can argue that this is inherent in the generational differences.
$C: He‚Äôll be handing out $100% bills to our children anytime they bring a whole room to standing ovation with some very true story 
$C: He even beat Einstein in a game of poker
$C: In terms of his notoriety and his ability to bring science to the masses, he was. But there are many physicists more worthy of that moniker based on the significance of their work.
$C: A little less lascivious though.
$C: Makes me wonder who is going to be the next Einstein or Hawking. I'm not sure if Nye or Tyson can fill those shoes.
$C: He is unarguably not the greatest mind of the 20th century. He was a very smart man who made one of the most important discoveries in physics. But he shares a century with Einstein, amongst many others.
$C: Uh...not to say he isn‚Äôt brilliant, he really is. But did you forget Einstein existed or
$C: John von Neumann?
$C: Alan Turing?
$C: Very tough argument to make , he made important contributions in his field. His contributions outside of science are more remarkable then within I‚Äôd say, not to minimize his research however.
$C: My condolences. I know where you're coming from.
$C: My dad got the same disease, diagnosed 2003, died 2009. Seeing Stephen Hawking has died has brought it back to the surface again.
$C: ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. It causes a slow death of the neurons that control your voluntary muscles. It's why he was bound to a wheelchair and had to use that text-to-speech. Around half of people die within about 3 years of getting it, and only 20% survive more than 10 years. 

Stephen Hawking lived more than 50 years after being diagnosed with it.
$C: Remember that disease everybody was pouring buckets of ice water over their heads to raise awareness for? That one.
$C: The documentary "Gleason" is about a football player with ALS. It's probably one of THE most incredible films I have ever seen. Watch it if you have a chance.
$C: He crunched the numbers, knew the math wasn't wrong, then said fuck it I've got more important things to do.
$C: And Star Trek! Playing poker with Data, Newton, and Einstein.
$C: Futurama was a better [cameo](https://youtu.be/AW-p8s_HCCo)
$C: and Star Trek: The Next Generation
$C: Don‚Äôt forget Family Guy
$C: And Futurama, head in a jar PLUS in the 20th century stealing the "FryHole" for the Journal Of Quantum Mechanics :)
$C: Dude made it big time when he met Sheldon. 
$C: Nope.  Isaac Newton.  Galileo.  Copernicus.  Hawking was incredibly special but because he‚Äôs the only person of that type that most of us have actually known during our lifetimes then we forget where he fits in historical context. Not taking away from Hawking at all, but he‚Äôs not the only genius to have ever lived 
$C: He was richer than you'll ever be.
$C: Seriously, he was given 2-4 years and somehow kept on kicking for 55. 
$C: It really is, most people with his condition live far shorter lives, he really beat the odds while also being an amazing scientist and inspiring many.
$C: A long and inspirational life. RIP
$C: Seriously - 76 is a long time for any normal, healthy, able-bodied person, let alone someone with ALS.  
$C: You could say its astronomical.
$C: His will to live is truly inspiring and legendary. 
$C: doctor gave him 2 years to live...54 years ago. probably lived long enough to roll over his grave.
$C: Honestly, I expected to be dead before Hawking. He defied predictions and kicked logic to the curb for so long it seems almost unreal that he's gone. 
$C: So he was born on Galileo‚Äôs 300th birthday and died on Albert Einstein‚Äôs birthday. 

Edit: Sorry, it was Galileo‚Äòs death day.
$C: This fact made me so damned happy. Thank you.
$C: If he were alive he'd say it was coincidence.
$C: He was born 300 years to the day after the death of Galileo and exits this world on Pi day. 
$C: Proof that we're in a simulation
$C: He's British, to him today was just 14/03/18.
$C: Well it's only the 13th, but still. Close enough.
$C: 30th Pi Day too.. but this Pi Day will not be a quirky happy one. 
$C: That username tho
$C: Of course it can be.  What other explanation could there be?
$C: I think him dying today was a choice rather than a coincidence. Case of death wasn't revealed for a reason. 
$C: The thing that made Stephen Hawking such a gift to mankind was the fact that he could never possibly, in a million lifetimes, have done everything he wanted.
$C: I don't think people like him *ever* do, even if they lived for a millenia. 
$C: i know he wanted to be Bond villain
$C: The man experienced zero gravity and smiled through the entire experience! He‚Äôs done more than many of us.
$C: Oh my god i had just finished A Brief History of Time and The Universe in a Nutshell and this happens.
$C: His books were what inspired me to study physics. RIP Dr. Hawking.
$C: The quote from your SO reminds me of a line from Fullmetal Alchemist. 

It‚Äôs a terrible day for rain...
$C: Your mom sounds like a bitch. 
$C: 'Starts thinking about the queen'
$C: The Queen outlives another. 
$C: We should celebrate his life however - he lived well well past his life expectancy and his life & his contributions were pretty much a miracle
$C: Especially when you consider how he lived so much longer than doctors ever imagined, you kind of forget about the mortality.
$C: Morgan Freeman...

*knocks on wood.*
$C: Honestly? That's what makes me less sad about it.

He had an incredibly serious disease and his life expectancy was almost nothing (around 25, I believe), yet he lived enough to be one of these people that we never even expect.

It's a sad occasion, sure, but he lived a very long life and made the most of it.
$C: 76 is... not that old...
$C: the three people i somehow considered immortal - leslie nielson, kurt vonnegut, george carlin - all died within a few years. once that happened, i knew no one was safe.
$C: I thought he'd still be kicking for another 10 years. Does anyone know if he ever retired?


$C: Oddly enough I was just thinking about his life earlier this week, and how far he made it. I was wondering when his time would come, guess today was it, he's accomplished so much against all odds, RIP
$C: Stan Lee comes to mind...
$C: just wait until Stan Lee kicks the bucket
$C: Same thing will happen when the Queen dies, even though I'm now aware of this effect 
$C: Agreed. I've been keeping up with and enjoying his stuff for a while, so this really struck me. 
$C: I never even thought of him as old. 
$C: He was honestly younger than I thought
$C: To be fair he dont really look super old. We are all used to his ‚Äòolder‚Äô looks. 
$C: Right? I had to do a double take on the headline to make sure that I wasn't on r/theonion and that what I saw is he is dead 
$C: i didn‚Äôt realize until today that i‚Äôd just assumed he would live forever 
$C: Huh?  That‚Äôs EXACTLY what you should expect from old people.  That‚Äôs literally how the lifecycle works.
$C: Yea exactly, I heard nothing, and then all of a sudden this. RIP.
$C: He has been losing muscle after muscle for decades. Recently, in the last year or so, I heard he was losing the muscles in his hand he could use to write with his computer, and the muscle on his face he could use to do that smirk whenever he plays a joke on someone. It has been inevitable for so long, you forget it is still happening, albeit gradually.
$C: I guess it would be acurrate to say that he's been in failing health for 50 years, would it not?
$C: I mean, to be fair, his health has been failing in a big way for more than 50 years. Honestly, I've sort of been expecting this for a while.
$C: Failing health? The guy was living with ALS for over 40 years. 
$C: > Hadn't heard anything about any sort of failing health.

His entire life was failing health.
$C: He‚Äôs been on a ventilator for a few years as he was unable to breathe unassisted. His muscles were literally failing one by one. 
$C: He has been in failing health for over 50 years.
$C: Yeah. This is a shocker, and a major loss to science. He was not only a major force, but also the face of modern science. 
$C: Not a lot of healthy people would even leave to 76. Especially if they are a man. At this point you could say he'd lost to age, not the disease.
$C: Honestly he probably threw up in his mouth or some random ass shit
$C: This man rose above the limits of his body to raise the limits of our understanding of the universe.
$C: When you learn that Hawking wasn't supposed to survive his teens, you learn to never doubt his health, so this hit like a ton of bricks. I am very sad. RIP
$C: Astronomy*, astrology is to do with horoscopes and the like.
$C: > My roommate is an astrology major


Man, they have majors for everything these days
$C: Oh man. That weight must just feel so bad...this is so sad.
$C: Astronomy, you mean. 
$C: My girlfriend is a science major and I just told her too. She had no idea who he was... Don't know how
$C: Dude IS a parent/relative to astrophysics majors. Hope one of his "kids" picks up the mantle. 
$C: > astrology/physics major

Now THAT is an interesting path to take. 
$C: I'm not even in the field of physics and it hit me the same way. 
$C: Once in a generation the world of science gets someone who is able to look at impossible problems and almost effortlessly figure out the answers. Who knows how long it will be before we get another luminary like Hawkings. How many more questions he could have answered. This is the end of an era within astrophysics.
$C: Yeah, Saturn is in retrograde - it can be tough.
$C: Fuck man, I'm a biochemist and when I heard he died, I had a similar reaction. The man is just an enormous pillar of science in general that the world feels emptier now that he's gone. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Physics here... I kinda want to cry. Tell your roommate a random Internet stranger is sending him a hug if he wants one.
$C: That‚Äôs how I felt when Steve Irwin died. 
$C: I've been getting notifications of just every ridiculous story. And I got one now expecting it to be the same. But then it's this. I am grateful I was able to be alive during at least some of his greatness.
$C: I've never actually cried over the death of a "famous" person. Oliver Sacks stung, but I'm in full on tears comparable to when my grandmother died last month.
$C: Too accurate 
$C: Ugh both made me sad
$C: "How can I shoehorn politics into absolutely everything? Let's see..."
$C: If those darn time travellers from that party he threw had bothered to show up he could have 
$C: At one point, I was convinced he would...
$C: Yea same :( I literally drew my head back in shock
$C: I would always hear so much about him, and have been really planning on just diving into his history. It's great and inspiring stuff. I've admired what I did hear of him, so this is still pretty sad.
$C: you jinxd him u fucker
$C: That's the thing, I (or other comments apparently) were especially shocked because there was no previous coverage or timeline of recent health troubles.
$C: I still have a Bio Lab midterm to study for, and this has distracted me in such an intense way
$C: Aw man, that's so sad :(
$C: Stop this whole celebrities dying because cursed year bullshit. People eventually die. You'll eventually die! 
$C: "My expectations were reduced to zero when I was 21. Everything since then has been a bonus."

$C: I just love the fact that he threw time traveler parties and posted about them the next day. No one ever showed up according to him haha. RIP Dr. Hawking, your mind shall ever live on in physics and astronomy.

$C: "Boob" - Michael Scott
$C: Beep boop beep. 
$C: Amazing that his life landed within the timeline of technological advancement that allowed him to break from that mental prison of his. Even if he did have to suffer in early stages (some might say this built his character). 
$C: and how much he changed science during that time.
$C: I'll miss his awesome tv specials.  I used to have to watch them 5 times to even get close to understanding them.  Rest in peace you brilliant man....you made the world a better place.
$C: yeah. not only that he got the time that he did, but that he did incredible things with that time. 
$C: Ignoramuses are too busy celebrating the lowly Trump, Kanye, Jayz, and Elon Musk.   Elon Musk is not lowly but one of the profoundly stupid people who thinks he‚Äôs brilliant.  Too smart and brilliant to use his billions to help a starving, unhealthy, and ignorant humanity.  We are at the brink of nuclear war with a former game show host and carnival barker at the helm‚Äî-but all people like Elon want to do is show off and garner praise for himself. 
$C: No Lambos for Hawking.
$C: Professor, as well. Typically people who are tenured professors are addressed that way (in an academic setting) since tenure is a step further than simply getting a PhD.
$C:  Considering his accomplishments, PhD almost seems like an underselling. He was truly one of the great minds of a generation. Maybe Super-Duper Dr. Hawking is more appropriate. 
$C: He was smart enough that degrees got him instead.  

The h in PhD stands for "Hawking". 
$C: At my college we traditionally called our professors mr./Mrs./ms. 

It isn‚Äôt inherently disrespectful. 
$C: Modern style guides generally indicate that in written works a PhD holder is not referred to as "Dr. Stephen Hawking", but rather they are referred to as "Stephen Hawking, PhD". This is what is taught by the APA and the New York Times style guide, so virtually all journalists will do it this way.

I'm not sure why, but I feel like it has something to do with degree creep and medical doctors being more vocal and more insecure about their graduate degrees. Historically a doctor was anyone with a doctorate, which was a specific degree that conferred the ability to teach. Likewise in history, someone with a university degree in healing, what we call a medical doctor today, was called a "physician". A "doctor of medicine" would have been a physician of great experience and education who was so expert that they taught other doctors at a medical school. 

There's a lot more history that's frankly rather silly if you want to look into it (quibbling about titles in general is pretty silly, actually). For example, early doctors often felt that surgery was below them, so much surgery (up to and including limb amputations) was performed by barbers- the people who cut your hair- because they happened to be the people with sharp razors. These people often apprenticed with a doctor or with another experienced surgeon, but rarely attended medical school and attained a medical degree on their own. For this reason, even to today, surgeons in the UK and some other culturally influenced countries are called "Mr/Mrs" rather than "Doctor". 

Edit: I'll also note that in the early 1900's the reverse style was suggested. Medical doctors should be referred to as "John Smith, MD" rather than "Dr. John Smith," which at that time was reserved for holders of doctorates. These days the number of medical doctors far outnumbers the people with PhD's so the current style is likely to stay that way for the foreseeable future. 
$C: Does it fucking matter? 

Seems like such a petty thing to argue about, particularly given his actual death and the fact that as I'm sure, he likely wouldn't care at all if people pronounced him as Mr Hawking vs Dr Hawking.
$C: Humble people don't care if you call them Dr or not. The ones who I've met who tended to care are medical doctors. What truly matters is that Hawking's legacy lives on.
$C: Had.. Sobs silently..
$C: Ha oh excuse us bro
$C: Ignorance is someone who doesn't know at all, the illusion is someone who thinks they know. But they're pretty similar. 
$C: Ignorance is the absence of knowledge. It's often used in a negitive manner but has no intentions of it.

$C: If there was a god he wouldn't be as dumb as the church but there isn't one so no need to worry.
$C: My first reaction was wow he's 76, he lived a long time with ALS. But you're right it never really occurred to me that he could ever die. He sure lived an incredible and inspiring life. 
$C: In a way he was immortal in the only way we mortals ever are, and that's through rememberence. His name will remain until all are forgotten.
$C: When I was a teen, I found out Stephen Hawking was *still alive* and it shocked me. Throughout my childhood his contributions had been placed alongside the likes of Einstein and it just never occurred to me that someone like that could still be among us.

Fast forward a decade. Ironically, his condition and synthesiser make it seem like he never aged. He appears the same as he did when I first saw a picture of him, like an abstract icon.

And now a guy I've never met just passed away. For the first time - for some reason - I feel l connect to him as a real person and I'm personally gutted.
$C: Nature's first green is gold,  
Her hardest hue to hold.  
Her early leaf's a flower;  
But only so an hour.  
Then leaf subsides to leaf.  
So Eden sank to grief,  
So dawn goes down to day.  
Nothing gold can stay. 
$C: You are absolutely right. My grandmother‚Äôs funeral service just finished and it really hit home that nothing is eternal. 
$C: I totally agree. So weird...
$C: Hawking is immortalized, not just in his brilliant books and lectures, and all the students he taught, but in his sense of humor on comedies and sci-fi like *The Simpsons*, *Futurama*, and *Star Trek*.  As if his brilliance weren't staggering enough, the man was *funny*, and had a brilliant sense of humor.
$C: He just wasn't meant to go yet. He had a purpose in this world to fulfill and he did
$C: He seemed to me more like a presence than a person, a force that would periodically share hope, ideas, or warnings with a perspective that made ordinary human business seem small in comparison.

He was human though, with all that comes with, and I hope people remember him both as a giant in his field and as what real people may be. I feel fortunate to have lived in his time... whatever that is.
$C: What I think about in this case is that people like him, who have more support than the average person due to career success and wealth, carry on and continue to work despite their health problems. 

We don't really get to witness their suffering. But if we stop to think about it, no matter how much technology and nursing support he had, he was likely suffering greatly with constant pain and discomfort for years and years. That doesn't even take into account the psychological difficulties of being bound to a chair and unable to move on your own for decades. He likely suffered from physical pain and other significant discomforts for years and years. We were distracted by his ability to persevere and produce mental work.

I'm sure he had his moments in private. But he seemed to continue to care about humanity, despite being dealt a bad hand by nature. And also despite evidence that humanity in determined to screw itself over by being shortsighted. 

I had an aunt that died last year. She was well known in the community for her charitable work helping a large number of kids through several generations. The celebration that her foundation held for her 90th birthday was amazing. Children, that were the children of children she had previously helped were there to celebrate. She was suffering greatly from health problems and was in constant pain. She never showed it in public though. The last few months of her life were terrible. But thankfully, no one in the community will remember that part. She will be remembered as a giving figure that helped so many people. Thousands showed up to her funeral. It's amazing that she braved a smiling face up to just before she went to the hospital the very last time. We don't get to see that private part of some public people's lives.
$C: With all due respect to him, it's probably because he had amazing care which not everyone with his condition has. He's lived a very fulfilling life.
$C: Except that sex tape that some how made it onto the internet.
$C: A man with an inert body and a brilliant mind, he was a living metaphor, some kind of Platonic Ideal version of a scientist. If he didn't really exist he'd seem too cliched to be believable. He was and will continue to be a powerful cultural icon for the abstract idea of learning.
$C: Shit man i felt that
$C: It's kind of 'because of' his condition, I think. Many of the clues you use to make decisions about people's health and age did not apply to him. You couldn't judge him physically, you couldn't judge the tone of his voice. 
$C: except for......
$C: Its actually painful to imagine a mind working not just well, but brilliantly inside a body like that. Goes to show bravery has so many forms.
$C: It was the robot voice...
$C: Damn, that is the perfect way to describe him.
$C: Were only immortal for a limited time.
$C: Seventy fucking six, dude was sneaky old. 
$C: I honestly had no idea how old he was. I thought he was in the age range of 50-87. Regardless, he lived an amazing life. 
$C: like the Queen
she‚Äôll die eventually
... maybe
$C: > He didn't seem like a man who would ever die, but his death is a crude reminder that nothing lives forever.

You're wrong friend. Stephen Hawking achieved so much that he will live on forever. 


$C: Yea, after seeing him in so many articles and videos I just assumed that he would live for many more years. It just feels like something is missing now that he's gone.
$C: His final comment on the internet, warning us of the dangers of inequality: https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3nyn5i/comment/cvsdmkv?st=JEQKSDNR&sh=dd00aa5a
$C: Like Queen Elizabeth II, she just is, she better not have an expiry date.
$C: Reminds me of the manga Oh My Goddess. Something lives on long enough that the idea of it ending or in this case dying just seems so alien and bizarre.
$C: Everyone talks about the next rockstar and actor that's going to die. Legitimately never thought about Hawking. It still feels weird.
$C: I just assumed he'd figured out immortality
$C: yeah, that's how I figured it was too. Shame, but he lived a great life. The world will miss you, sir. Damn, this was unexpected.
$C: Honestly, the man overcame so much in his life a small part of me believed he had even outsmarted death itself. RIP
$C: I hope this doesn't come off as crass or anything, but I think it's partially because he was so physically crippled by the condition. You didn't really associate him with aging and deteriorating, his computerized voice was timeless and iconic. Hell, he refused to even update it to more modern ones because it was such an identifying part of him.
$C: He was the Snoop Dogg of Science
$C: In response to your edit, he had one of [the best lines in ERB history.](https://youtu.be/zn7-fVtT16k?t=1m18s)
$C: Yup. But he will always be with us, in Spirit.

Or the computer voice will finally admit it's been in control for years...
$C: Honestly I didn't know he was 76. He seemed younger, despite his condition.
$C: Richard Dawkins / stephen HawKING
$C: I think it feels weird because what people like Hawking accomplished transcends their own life. They made a real impact on so many others that to think of their legacy as separate from them while their still alive seems... odd.
$C: His name is Stephen Hawking
$C: I was just thinking of the Queen of England living to be like 140 earlier today.
$C: How about the [TNG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEa7CfPaCRw) with him, Einstein and Data.

$C: > Anyways RIP Stephen Hawkins.

Come on, he just died and you're misspelling his name?

Stephen Hawkinz would be very disappointed.
$C: Like Betty White.
$C: It‚Äôs as if he‚Äôs been dead for years and we‚Äôve just assumed he is a sentient computer.
$C: Well his voice is immortal! 
$C: I recognized that acronym as rap battle, but because of the internet my brain filled in the E as erotic and I got grossed out.  Damn you ERPers.
$C: Well to be fair he lived ***way longer*** than people typically do with this disease.
$C: https://youtu.be/zn7-fVtT16k
$C: Yeah.  I mean the idea of a death pool makes me shudder but I still would never even have thought to put Hawking on such a list.
$C: Truly shocked as well. But I think he's someone that will live on in public consciousness for many many years. 
$C: "It would not be much of a universe if it wasn't home to the people you love."

~S.H
$C: There are ten million million million million million million million million million particles in the universe that we can observe..
$C: Kind of like the queen. 
$C: Another example of this would be the Queen. 
$C: Once David Bowie died, I figured anyone was fair game.
$C: For me it was partially that due to his condition I never really thought about how old he was. 
$C: Muhammad Ali, Nelson Mandela
$C: One of the greats.


Stephen Hawkins was also one of the greatest men to ever live. 
$C: That was the first thing that I thought of as well. Him dying at ALL just feels incredibly alienbamd confusing. Like, it feels like he should have been eternal.
$C: So what if he asked that? Dude could have died to an assassin or hundred other things.
$C: Um, I accidentally deleted this by accident. Not staff. Sorry
$C: Oh wait i already told you this and it was an accident. Sorry.
$C: Let's be honest, 76 isn't an early age for anyone. And for someone diagnosed with ALS when he was, it's several lifetimes. But I'd say he made about a hundred lifetimes out of what he had. Lots of people are brilliant. Very few are able to be brilliant and still appeal and be understood by the non-brilliant. If you've ever read "A Brief History of Time" you'll know what I mean. It didn't talk down, and it wasn't a textbook. It was a truly accessible book of topics that couldn't be understood without someone like Hawking to put them into terms that the average person could grasp.
$C: He left us a lot already. I‚Äôm grateful for what technology allowed him to communicate to us
$C: Seriously... This one hurts me. I picked up an old beaten copy of "A Brief History of Time" at a neighborhood garage sale in 6-7th grade and it was easily a formative part of my desire to pursue a scientific career.

Stephen Hawking is a legend and inspiration in every sense of the words.


$C: "My expectations were reduced to zero when I was 21. Everything since then has been a bonus."
$C: He might have had some personal problems but his work changed the field of physics.
$C: He once held a party for time travelers, but didn't announce it until the next day. No one came.
$C: Loved him in Star Trek: TNG as a kid. 
$C: Just a fucking shame the last he knew of this world was an absolute mess.
$C: And hilarious in Futurama.
$C: For someone like me and millions of other people he made something the scale of the universe and tinier than anything we can imagine accessible to the average person. I'm sure he has inspired a passion in people to pursue science. RIP.
$C: A lot of us felt the same way when Christopher Reeves and Ali passed. You just don't expect it, even though it's very expected.
$C: I'm sure he'd argue about how happy he was with his mobility, all things considered. The man was able to accomplish more than most able bodied people could dream of. 
$C: [removed]
$C: Just curious, what do you think it limited him from doing? Seems he managed it pretty well.
$C: Its thought that had he not had such a disability his popularity in the media would be practically nonexistent.  
$C: We can pour a buck of water on our head to fight it. 
$C: Bill Nye isn't remotely close to the scientist Hawking was. 
$C: That michio Kaku guy? I butchered his name though 
$C: Astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson, and Quantum physicists Michio Kaku are the two who come to my mind immediately. 
$C: Nye doesn't even have a PhD. Michio Kaku (though he seems to be more of a bullshit peddler these days), Richard Dawkins, Tyson, Jane Goodall, David Attenborough for Brits, David Suzuki for Canadians. For more worldly people maybe Lawrence Krauss, Brian Greene, Stephen Jay Gould, V.S. Ramachandran, Stephen Pinker, and Jared Diamond.
$C: Neil DeGrasse Tyson. Also, Bill Nye is an engineer.
$C: Bill Nye is an entertainer, not a scientist.
$C: Michio Kaku has some celebrity.  And there's Neil Degrasse Tyson.
$C: Neil DeGrasse Tyson
$C: NDT, does Hadfield count? I mean Musk aint a scientist but his companies doing hella science stuff
$C: Neil Degrasse Tyson
$C: Neil Degrasse Tyson.
$C: Susskind, Witten, Greene, Higgs
$C: What about neil?
$C: Neil DeGrasse Tyson, maybe.  My redneck  semi truck driving, Trump supporting uncle even knows who he is.
$C: It all feels surreal. People who you look up to passing on always gets me :( rip
$C: Slightly off topic but I've always been surprised about how recent Einstein died.  He died in 1955.  I would have guessed it was much earlier
$C: No kidding
$C: The next sunrise will be a salute to him. 
$C: He was our Einstein üíî
$C: He died on Einstein‚Äôs birthday, too. :(
$C: We shared a lifetime with him out of all possible lifetimes.
$C: Hey at least he lived a life worth living - a long and amazing life. He was given two years to live and lived to be 76...which is actually the average life expectancy of a male in the US (or close to it)!

Our world is better because he was in it. The world could have two years of Mr. Hawking, but instead we got 55 years of him. Definitely one to be missed, but definitely lived an amazing life.
$C: Yeah. I knew he had his lifelong illness, but didn't know if he was battling something else recently. 

Seeing the news made me sad, and I never followed him super close. But even then, I know he lived a remarkable life. 

I'm glad they made a movie about him while he was still around to see it. I might have to look and see what kind of reception it got with him.
$C: Yeah he's pretty much a household name
$C: 76 isn't a bad run though, especially considering the medical condition he had to deal with. 

Solid performance, Mr. Hawking. Well done.
$C: Time is a cruel mistress. 
$C: He did not disappear. He lives on in the people he inspired, and his work that will surely be continued.
$C: My goodness, I didn't even consider this. Wow what a magnificent mind. 
$C: He was also on Dexter's Laboratory my favorite episode. :( 
$C: He had assistants writing them out on boards as well. But it was because his brilliance that people around him did what they could to help him radiate it.
$C: Working out equations might be the easy part of what he did. Finding explanations for things you can't even observe well is the hardest thing IMO.
$C: This doesn't even poke the surface of his ability. Physicists do more than manipulate equations.
$C: Okay, /u/ValveFan6969
$C: i swear to fuck if u say thoughts and prayers 
$C: Idol and Icon
$C: I'd say archetype - the deformed other, who brings ambivalent gifts and unambivalent power.  Like Vulcan or Wayland the Smith, or Goibniu. 


$C: [deleted]
$C: Yeah, I'm literally reading these comments and tearing up
$C: This comment kinda hit me hard. That last part really says it all. 
$C: Just grabbed my copy off the bookshelf as soon as I read that he passed. I‚Äôll be rereading it this week. 
$C: GL i got through like 2/3s of it before my brain exploded and couldnt keep up
$C: You won‚Äôt regret it.
$C: It‚Äôs really worth reading.
$C: If you (like me) aren't familiar with that type of reading, there's an edition called the BriefER History of Time. Laughable, maybe, but I found it extremely enlightening and interesting. The man was just too smart for the masses, but his ideas deserve to live on in all of us
$C: Finished the chapter about black holes yesterday, really mind-blowing stuff
$C: I found Contact, a scifi novel by Sagan, really inspiring. 
$C: 76 is unprecedented when 80% of ALS sufferers last under 5 years after diagnosis, so yeah he made it his bitch
$C: Also known as Lou Gehrig's disease
$C: There are plenty of people that are significant enough to take his place; you are just not significant enough to know any of them. Time to step it up.
$C: Sort of: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality_Drive
In short, he and a few other humans have their DNA stored in space in case the world is wiped out and an advanced enough alien race finds us and wants to revive some of us
$C: Hawking radiation, bro. Once it is perceived, he shall receive his Nobel Prize in Physics. 
$C: Pi day too? Of all days?
$C: One of the saddest coincidences I can think of.
$C: Now the real question is: Who was born today?
$C: I will! :)
$C: I love it when Reddit is wholesome. 
$C: Fuck dude, I'm on my way to a lecture. And this thread's already made me quite emotional. And now I'm crying in the tram.
$C: Yeah, do it for Steve O
$C: Friend is pursuing biology, she's damn heartbroken. Said she always wanted to meet him.
$C: I prefer Errol Morris‚Äô documentary ‚ÄúA Brief History of Time‚Äù- kinda a combination life story with some of Stephen‚Äôs science as well.

I‚Äôll be re-watching it soon. 
$C: wow those comments. Gifs are now placed where roses once were.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I didn't realize how old he was. How lucky we all were reap the benefits of his extraordinary mind for so many years.
$C: Maybe the time travelers did it out of respect, so that his life's work wouldn't get overwritten by the first recorded interaction with time travel
$C: And on Pi Day, at that.
$C: I mean it's not a phenomena it's a coincidence but it's still pretty neat in my opinion
$C: Absolutely agree.
$C: The glass is half full of stars.
$C: But the average world IQ just dropped substantially.
$C: Ken M, is that you?
$C: Definitely, and there's Feynman and others, too. But it's not a contest. These people are all part of the pantheon. 
$C: There are so many great ones, it's just that everyone knows who Hawking is
$C: Can we like....not shit on a comment celebrating 2 great scientists?

K thanks
$C: ...shhh it's cooler if it's Pi Day
$C: It's hard to tell at this point. The earliest reports I've found were about 4 hours ago which means he might have died on 3/14. I assume he died at the stroke of midnight.

Of course, the Brits would say he died on 14/3 which is definitely not pi anything, but what do they know.
$C: Because it never happened again
$C: Hawking has got you, bro
$C: *hawking smiling from behind the cloud in heaven*
$C: Lookin' good!
$C: Slow down!
$C: ....the dog's name?
$C: People have sex you know
$C: You might even say....like a hawk.
$C: I personally enjoyed A Brief History of Time, so yes.
$C: It went *okay*.
$C: Chill man
$C: Doesn‚Äôt matter, had sex
$C: This is one of those i find funny cuz it isn‚Äôt a ‚ÄúLOL he ded‚Äù joke. 
$C: News headlines. 

‚ÄúMan accused of murder as he used the words ‚Äúno u‚Äù in a comment section on Reddit, talking about Stephen Hawking‚Äò sedate, government officials are considering a ban on this horrible assault word.‚Äù
$C: This thought makes me uncomfortable
$C: I wonder if they tried turning him off and back on again.
$C: Good question. Maybe even if rigor mortis had set in when he was discovered lifeless, it might not be possible to tell if he were dead at that time, just given his particular circumstances. 
$C: Thank you captain literal!
$C: He used Windows 10
$C: Pretty sure he used windows vista
$C: He‚Äôs like the guy who was told ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt have a character with those stats he won‚Äôt last very long just roll again‚Äù and then he kept the character alive until level 20
$C: Listen when you nail every con save for decades sometimes the DM just decides you die. In this case he seems to have had to tear the character sheet from the players hands. I wish I had a tenth of the drive of Mr Hawking
$C: I was in a serious road accident in January 1994. I was still in hospital when *Division Bell* was released, and it was given to me as a get well gift.

I only had that CD, plus Tubular Bells 2, to listen to for months. It will forever be associated with cool morphine dripping into me from the automatic dispenser.

The backing singers begging to know *why won't you talk to me* with the distorted voice effect guitar. I had no one to talk to alone in a hospital room.

Now that song will remind me of Professor Hawking as well.
$C: except for Galileo.
$C: Day? What time zone are you in?
$C: I thought about that too. But his wiki page just updated and said it‚Äôs 14th. He‚Äôs also a British and has died in the UK. It‚Äôs probably 14th there while it‚Äôs still 13th in the US, though.
$C: At least in heaven i can skate
$C: Let's hope hell has a ramp. 
$C: Or did he? dun.. dun.. DUN.

$C: [removed]
$C: This is a quote from A Brief History of Time 
$C: Literally the first paragraph in ‚ÄúA Brief History of Time‚Äù written by Stephen Hawking... 
$C: Is to make way for version 2
$C: Weak bait 
$C: What do you honestly get out of shitting on everybody that gives a shit about the man?  If you don't care, why comment?

Edit: I'm sure you're contributing much more to the world arguing over whether children are sellable property or not...real important work you're doing there...
$C: Either uneducated or a troll. Not very classy.
$C: Harsh but true
$C: Different fields, but still both impactful. Some may argue one more so than the other. 
$C: The same way he speaks? 
$C: The interesting part about that are the odds of this happening, not judging how good he was. And Pi is still very coorelated with physics...
$C: Lmao you're a real subtle troll aren't ya
$C: Common mistake. Hawking is the greatest mind, Kanye is the greatest human. Long live Kanye
$C: Amy Schumer?
$C: Man I‚Äôm an engineer. If I had any sense of eloquence I would‚Äôve been a lawyer. 
$C: The least eloquent way to say it would be to make a hypothetical where an alien came to earth and asked to see your leader and instead of taking them to the Whitehouse, you‚Äôd would‚Äôve taken them to Stephen,


actually comment, I need to stop sorting by controversial 
$C: /r/nothingeverhappens
$C: Why not?
$C: Yes, this maybe the outcome if great pharam companies dont invest in the research of certain drugs, but at least there would be a cure.
$C: By retiring 
$C: I liked it
$C: That is wild!
$C: Oh, I was a fan. But his death hasn't hit me as hard as these other four that I listed
$C: How? He survived with a horrible disease that‚Äôs basically a death sentence, slowly creeping in and stealing your bodies functions. And became a world renowned scientist while doing so, as well as building a family for himself. 

That‚Äôs pretty damn motivating to me. But then again I don‚Äôt know much about him.
$C: But Albert's mama took the ugly particles and put them in one nerd. 
$C: If he died in the UK, piday for him.
$C: dude stephen hawkins spoke against donald trump being elected

and they trashed him for it....and wished for his death all over the_donald during that time period...im surprised you missed it
$C: sure

me and every other black person in america is wrong.....we thought it was the trump supporters and the confederate flag waving neo nazis 

but it was really nancy pelosi....and obamacare that was the true racism!

sorry....we so stoopid lol
$C: oh.. 3/13 in the US still.. I'm glad that happened at least.
$C: This is very tragic and I wish more Americans understood what this means
$C: Thanks! I know I can read Wikipedia. Just wanted some users' personal favorites! 
$C: I know that :). I'm just saying he was one of the greatest as could do astrophysics in his head, Just helps when we have the greatest minds alive you know :)
$C: Ok. Pretty ironic. I just heard of pi day yesterday myself didn't even know it was a thing.
$C: Elon‚Äôs not just an investor nor is his intent on just marketing. Elon‚Äôs a futurist who is actually doing something that will better humanity. Why do you think investors were skeptical on his companies? Because these companies weren‚Äôt made to pull significant amounts of revenue to boost net worth of share holders/investors. They were made to fulfill a dream and quite possibly a necessity (with how things are going) by using that revenue to fund more advancements. 

So when you ask why one of my inspirations is an investor, it‚Äôs because this ‚Äúinvestor‚Äù has bigger plans with humanity‚Äôs future than just sitting on a rotating globe with dicks in our hands fighting about whose world power leaders dick is bigger than the others. 

So my answer is, how you the fuck is the guy who is literally wanting to better Earth and Humanity with each dollar he‚Äôs got not one of your inspirations?
$C: It's also Einstein's birthday
$C: Both are cars. 
$C: Of course they get the final say. When it comes to getting someone into Space quickly Musk is the guy to go to now. 

I wonder what Hawkins plans were for his final resting place. I can imagine it‚Äôs something he would have thought about. Would he have wanted to donate his brain to science like Einstein? 
$C: they occasionally bathe her in the lazarus pit.
$C: Unbelievable comment
$C: I suppose. I guess I was expecting some lead-up. "stephen hawking's condition takes turn for the worst" kind of thing. not just flipping through reddit to stumble over a thread saying "he's dead" with no details. 
$C: Me too lul
$C: You're actually trolling right?
$C: Because the joke isn't funny
$C: Jesus. Why do people even do shit like this?
$C: Why do you start your comment off with "I mean" when you aren't clarifying anything you've said before?
$C: Theories.  He didn't "show" shit.  He made a theory.  Theories have a history of being changed decades later when new technology emerges.  His theory of black holes and views of the big bang are as much proven as a dark matter is.  It's all a guess.
$C: Black holes don't exist. Stars and planets orbit their galaxial center of mass, just like clouds orbit the center of a hurricane. Observing movement around empty space doesn't mean there's something in that space. 
$C: Then he what?

You certainly look much smarter and more accomplished than him! Wow, why were we even listening to Hawking when you were here all along?!
$C: What is Hawking radiation? fuck off. Man was brilliant.
$C: Everything in science is a theory
$C: Somehow I believe Hawking won't mind.
$C: [removed]
$C: So what you're saying is you don't know.

You just know he was a person.

Good job kid.
$C: [removed]
$C: That sounds dirty...
$C: [deleted]
$C: What part of what I said sounds crazy?  You do know that the ai revolution and singularity are the hottest topics in the scientific community, right?  Wait but why has done several excellent write-up on this topic.
$C: I would have to respectfully disagree with you. Whether there is a God or not - whether my God is the God of the universe or not - it is nothing but an honor to be considered worthy of eternal life by any living being. 
$C: He was atheist for sure.  

‚Äúwe would know everything that God would know, if there were a God. Which there isn't. I'm an atheist." -SH
$C: That‚Äôs my view and I‚Äôm Catholic for God‚Äôs sake! In fact I think that is the general consensus of anyone reputable in the Catholic Church. Sad no one has really spoken out about this. The Catholic Church has been absolutely in support of scientific discovery and research. Each year, the Vatican hosts a world meeting of scientists (not sure if that‚Äôs an accurate title), which Stephen has attended many times. It is entirely devoted to sharing updates on scientific discovery and discussing them. As far as I‚Äôm concerned, the more we learn about science, the more we learn about God. I think Stephen Hawking would agree, especially if he‚Äôs walking confidently through the ‚Äúpearly gates‚Äù right now! I don‚Äôt know why my comment has so many downvotes. Wouldn‚Äôt anyone be honored to be considered worthy of eternal life by any living being? It‚Äôs not offensive, or at least I didn‚Äôt mean it to be...
$C: And to answer your question he was back and forth on the God question 
$C: You leave Jesus out of this!
$C: No really? You're telling me now, years can't be responsible for lives?
$C: Fuck me for being shocked I guess
$C: Nobody cares about black holes I'm never going to see one, it doesn't affect anybody's life in any way he might aswell have done crayon drawings instead atleast he'd produce something of value in 50 years doing that
$C: [removed]
$C: >You seem pleasant.

Yeah, like a boil on the tip of your dick pleasant..
$C: That‚Äôs kind of my point.

What exactly did he contribute?
$C: Feel free to explain how these black holes, singularities and big bangs developed in the first place then, Mr. Big Brain.

Even Hawking couldn‚Äôt do that.
$C: ^ Username checks out.
$C: your fedora is on WAY too tight, mr atheist
$C: [removed]
$C: great point. can time please just stop.

$C: Thats how I felt when everyone was complaining about "fuck 2016"
$C: Go to hell.
$C: Gods word...The Bible. I bet my life on it. 
$C: Posted hours after it happened. 


$C: i'm treating part of modern science as a religion because it has just as much bullshit 
$C: Romans  1:20  
For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:
$C: *of 2008
$C: Bitching about it is so 2009.
$C: As a time traveler you never miss out.  You can always return and make it right. Right?
$C: Maybe they just weren‚Äôt on time... 
$C: My theory is that they went, had a blast, and made a deal to keep it a secret.
$C: It wasn't really that great of a party, the chips were the cheap salty ones and the drinks was pops and beer, no liquor. I have better things to do.
$C: They dont missed out, outside the window during the parties you can see a mysterious figure, watching... In tearfull eyes he whisper 'Thanks...' before warping away.
$C: >  Those time travelers missed out

Perfect excuse to use for our shitty childhood parties where people didnt show up ..... I sent a letter to everyone in  the future and the reason no one showed up is because time travellers do not exist yet.  
$C: Who‚Äôs to say Hawking isn‚Äôt a nobody, historically speaking, if time travel is ever possible?
$C: I so would have gone
$C: Plot twist: Stephen Hawking was a time traveller. He threw a party for himself.
$C: There's a theory that he killed them all to preserve space-time continuum. Maybe one waited to see if it was a trap and went back in time again to tell them all to leave before his plot transpired. 
$C: The party is over and nobody came. He didn‚Äôt tell anyone until afterwards so that the only people who could come were time travellers. If someone went back in the future to his party they would have been in attendance at the time.
$C: This guy Stein's gate
$C: Patent that shit. 
$C: Pah that‚Äôs nothing. My friend has one where you go there on a Friday, drink 26 beers and next thing you know it‚Äôs Monday morning. He hasn‚Äôt quite managed to fix the side-effects of headaches and vomiting yet though.
$C: interesting concept. 
$C: Sounds like you started playing EU4
$C: What's the name of the strip club?
$C: Ah, the ole Tequila Time Machine
$C: Where's the device that speeds up or slows the passage of time
$C: If you try Xanax it‚Äôll shoot you weeks ahead
$C: Hey mine too! But i keep losing my pants. Its getting expensive.
$C: He makes me close my eyes and suck on a tube for it to work
$C: Is it called vodka? My time
Machine works similarly 
$C: it's more like 0.000000001 of a second
$C: I don't get it
$C: Why? We all know how smart Hawking was. We lived it. Mass media is a thing. So is the internet. The man has been on a vast number of TV shows and interviews.

Besides their discoveries and publications, we don't have the slightest inkling of the genius of those who came before. To have discovered phenomena far before the devices to measure and simulate them were even theorized.

Fermat, Leibnez, Doppler. Not to derogate from the accomplishments of Dr. Hawking, but there are less documented, and therefore far more interesting, candidates.

Edit: forgot a word
$C: Also considering he was told he had two years left to live IN 1963
$C: My mother is also living with ALS, so far for eight years.

Current thinking is indeed that it does represent a spectrum of disorders with the same primary symptom: degeneration of motor neurons. We've discovered genetic causes for about ten percent of cases, and are atm in the dark about the primary cause for the other 90%. There is also definitely a spread in how fast the disease does progress, though there is no halting it.

AMA for questions that I can answer as an informed relative, I am not a medical professional. 
$C: I think years ago that I read something like 5% or less of ALS cases have kind of slow progression his hadz and pretty much all the others are the 2 year cases
$C: 2nd longest
$C: Yea I cant remember details but there are definitely a lot of people who believe he was misdiagnosed
$C: A friend of mine is an SLP and in the past they told me a lot of ALS patients die when they lose control of their swallowing muscles. When they can‚Äôt control their swallowing there is a high likelyhood of getting fluid in their lungs and getting pneumonia. 

Steven hawking was very lucky and had good nurses to make sure this didn‚Äôt happen to him.
$C: Because he had generic motor neuron disease and apparently not specific ALS/gherigs, although all very similar diseases.

Edit: or they're all the same disease and symptoms vary case to case -  my mistake!
$C: If only we had more ice bucket challenges
$C: It‚Äôs possible. A good friend of mine used to say fuck Hawking because he had lived longer with ALS. Sadly he passed 6 years ago and he was only 2ish years ahead of Hawking. He was a mean cuss. I can‚Äôt imagine living decades with that disease. I‚Äôm the end he had pneumonia multiple times in a few month period and he just couldn‚Äôt recover. 

http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/norwichbulletin/obituary.aspx?pid=158024893
$C: Lou Gehrig had an early onset and he died quick. We honestly just don‚Äôt know that much about this disease.
$C: I think because he was so intelligent his brain helped him a lot.
$C: If I remember correctly, he was diagnosed at 21 and was given 2 years to live at that point. Even living to 30 would have been unusual. 
$C: That‚Äôd mess with me thinking it‚Äôs coming any day now. I hope he was able to get over that somehow and find some inner peace early enough to find some joy in all of those unexpected years he ended up having. 
$C: Hawking would actually be a dope name for a ship
$C: 2 shuttlecraft from TNG got his name on them as well as 4 ships in the expanded universe.
$C: Hell, they did it in Into Darkness after Ray Bradbury died.
$C: Whenever we get around to firing a probe at a black hole, it'll almost certainly be named for him.
$C: The Hawking. 

That's an awesome name for a space ship. 
$C: And if Nvidia will name a GPU architecture after him.
$C: I hope Elon names the first spaceship going to mars in his honor
$C: They should name the first sentient AI ship after him to add extra irony to the moment it turns on us.  The ultimate 'I told you so'.  Too bad he'll be dead already. 

To clarify, he is on record as not being concerned about a robot revolution against humanity.
$C: He definitely deserves something major from NASA. Like the Hawking Lunar Station, put his name on the planned lunar orbital station 
$C: I bet it's a millennial asking if it's an actual scene, and wondering why it doesn't look like the movie.

$C: Completely agree - didn‚Äôt mean it in a disrespectful way .. I love how unique he sounds. Incredible man. 
$C: Even if it was an American accent.
$C: Do you believe he thought in this voice ?
$C: The NEW DODGE RAM from the mind of Stephen Hawking.
$C: He was also born [exactly 300 years...to the day...after the death of Galileo](https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/whos_who_level1/hawking.html).
$C: March 14th is also Pi day to many.  A day to celebrate math and have yummy pie.  
$C: Also they were both 76.  
$C: Another fun fact- he was born exactly 300 years after the death of Galileo

---------

source- A brief history of time
$C: So what you're saying is That the next physics avatar has just been born?
$C: Notice anything specific about today's date?
$C: Also pie day. 3.14
$C: 

He died the 13th, source ABC's Nightline and this reddit article timestamp.
$C: Only... Hawking died on March 13th.
$C: Many people do. Like wondering what it was like when George Washington was alive, or Mahatma Gandhi, or Beethoven; they're people that are so well known, it's interesting to think about how people thought of them when they were still alive. For instance, George Washington was looked upon so highly that even the British mourned his death (iirc). 
$C: Time to watch *The Theory of Everything* again.
$C: Imagine having all 6 in a room together
$C: And how did he compare to other too scientists of the same time? 
$C: I was just changing the comment above. I believe he‚Äôs one of the greatest, not the greatest 
$C: I think Einstein might argue that it's all relative.
$C: Probably why he was so liked and respected. Admitted his mistakes. 
$C: The beauty of accepting that you are wrong about something is that it grants you an amazing opportunity to, ironically, not be wrong anymore. It's a discipline we should all strive to get better at.
$C: The man seemingly had no pride at all. He just went about his business of working to discover the secrets of the universe. He knew there was so much he didn't know and it kept him grounded, never knowing how much more intelligent he was than the common man. And yet his books were written in such a way that the common man could feel like he could understand Hawking's line of thinking.

Truly a wonderful person.
$C: Of course he did. He loved his work and it was never about his pride. 
$C: Change today to Steven Hawking's Day
$C: > He was willing to sacrifice his own pride to help move physics along and help humanity to develop a better understanding of our universe.

He represented the very essence of science and the scientific method. 

In an ideal world absolutely every self-respecting scientist would be doing that. 
$C: It‚Äôs also rare in all the other days and ages. 
$C: I think this is over the top.

Pretty much any respected scientist does this
$C: Cheated on his wife if I recall correctly. 
$C: He was a serial cheater.
$C: His marriage life was rocky to say the least although that's the only thing that comes to mind.
$C: From what I remember (and indeed, I don't pretend to be an expert on the live of Hawking) his first wife took care of him for decades, fell in love with somebody else but decided not to act on it (with the knowledge of the guy, by the way) because she wanted to keep her family together. 

Hawking would later divorce her for his nurse, who he would then in turn divorce a little while later. 


$C: The whole "cheating on his wife" thing leaves out some important details. She pursued an extramarital affair first, and was even open about it with Hawking. For his part, he handled the situation in stride, but it put strain on their marriage and he turned to his nurse for comfort, eventually leading to a divorce and a second marriage.  Sadly, there is some indication that Mason, his second wife, was psychologically abusive and kept Hawking from seeing his children, and after his second marriage fell apart Hawking reconciled with Jane, his first wife, and the two ended up close friends once more in the end. The point is, relationships are complicated, don't assume that "cheating" is always such an evil, nor that couples can't change their views as time passes. People change, sometimes in ways that don't work with their partner, so it is pretty stupid to question someone's morality over how their relationships turn out. 
$C: > personal morals

Compared to your average GOP supporter he was a saint. 

Opposed Iraq & Vietnam, supported universal healthcare & action against climate control, didn't believe in some imaginary man in the sky. 
$C: He "voiced" himself on a lot of cartoons from what I can remember. That or he just sort of generally made an appearance. At any rate the guy was probably the first scientist to ever become a major figure in pop culture.  
$C: There was certainly some humor in his TNG appearance, but not as his expense. He actually got the punchlines. 

>**Isaac Newton:** I invented physics. The day that apple fell on my head was the most momentous day in the history of science.

>**Prof. Stephen Hawking:** Not the apple story again.

Fun fact: Hawking is the only person to play themselves on *Star Trek*.
$C: I grew up taking care of my disabled mother and spending more time than is mentally healthy in nursing homes talking to people. I don't think the handicapped are all sitting there going "woe is me!" 24/7. I mean, they're still human, and people can get used to anything (especially if they have no choice..)

But that doesn't mean they're all smiles either. 

The amount of times my mom asked me to kill her....

$C: [can i?](https://media1.tenor.com/images/4a244da4e94af09d2b6610dd14cfe79c/tenor.gif?itemid=4695951) 
$C: Try "strode" on for a stroll, stranger. Strict strident strapping strudels stripped of their stringent strutting structure.
$C: He just dedicated his life to understanding time enough so he could warp it and make that 2 years last 40.
$C: I absolutely agree. He was also an amazing role model for those without disabilities. 

Inspiring man. He will be sorely missed.
$C: Wow, he managed to live nearly thirty times longer than he was told he had! This should really be inspiration to others with similar and other conditions, you can still potentially live a normal lifespan!
$C: I've lost people who don't even come close to his age who had little to nothing wrong with them. I lost my neighbor last week in her 60's fully healthy. It's not only for those with disabilities, but he served as a good role model for everyone. 
$C: ‚ÄúFuck that‚Äù in a badass robot voice
$C: He probably outlived the doctors that diagnosed him
$C: I don't know how much a role model he is.  He became what be was because he's hyper-intelligent.  You can't model an attribute you don't have.

$C: Good role model for all of us
$C: If I ever become injured or disabled I plan to flip off Death and tell him to fuck off just like Hawking did 
$C: One thing to note though, he had a special kind of ALS that progresses very slowly. It wasn't understood so well at the time, and the prognosis was a simple "best guess" based on the available data. It wasn't as a result of strength of will that he survived, and those who die faster are simply much less fortunate.

On the other hand, he repeatedly said that his disability and his seemingly hopeless prognosis allowed him to live his life to the full and implied that it helped his research progress. He is definitely an inspiration!
$C: Not really. Now you are going to be judged by hus standards and if you don't live it was because you didn't try as hard as him.
$C: It makes you wonder who will be the next one.  
$C: For real. The man has died a legend. 
$C: Well I mean he didn‚Äôt fuck or reproduce so...

(/s) 
$C: [removed]
$C: This is honestly more empowering for me. I get that people might think it's a slight at him, but to be able to do what he did *because* of his circumstances makes it more impressive to me. My grandfather died from ALS, and it was crazy seeing his body break down while his mind was still there. I hope I can rise to a challenge like they did.
$C: I don‚Äôt know why that‚Äôd be a fuck you to doctors. As a doctor, I don‚Äôt want my patients to die and would be very happy that I was wrong.
$C: If we ever develop time travel, I'd like to attend his time travel party. He threw a party for time travellers, but didn't announce it until after the fact, so no one showed up.
$C: No one claims immortality is impossible? 
$C: >  immortality is impossible

"When do you think people die? When they are shot through the heart by the bullet of a pistol? No. When they are ravaged by an incurable disease? No. When they drink a soup made from a poisonous mushroom!? No! It‚Äôs when they are forgotten." - Dr Hiluluk 
$C: I never knew that! I figured they just hlgot his permission use those lines.

That makes it even more awesome.
$C: My favorite small fact about him is that he was given the opportunity to upgrade his voice to sound more human; but he said he wanted to keep the robot voice because it made kids that have to use those machines feel less self conscious (and it was kind of *his* iconic thing at that point).
$C: "If you're looking for trouble, you found it." - Hawking
$C: He was also the only person to portray himself on Star Trek.  Just imagine him up there playing poker with Albert and Isaac.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Was it the same for his futurama appearances? 
$C: He most recently played the voice for Hitchhiker's Guide MK II for the latest BBC Radio Hitchhiker Series. First episode is available: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09th4hf
$C: Hey you're right I had a lot of fun reading that fact! 
$C: His [gansgta rap career](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J-FqrMf-kk) was also very cool
$C: Did he do the same for Futurama?? Dying to know this. 
$C: He was in an episode of Star Trek: TNG as well, and Futurama.
$C: Futurama as well
$C: Which is apparently the average life expectancy of a male in the US. Absolutely amazing he lived as long as he did, and continued making strides in the science community for pretty much his entire life!
$C: He wasn't sposed to make it past 25...
$C: the wave is here üåäüåäüåä

RIP hawking
$C: Sad wavy
$C: Maybe but explain why 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Nye definitely can't, not to disparage him. He's more of a pop scientist, not someone immersed in his field making advancements in the same way. Tyson is closer, but still not quite there, I don't think.
$C: Why are you being downvoted? This is definitely true. To put the latter on the same pedestal as the former would be irrational. 

Tyson and Nye have made huge strides in science, but , unless I am uninformed, those strides have been predominantly in terms of education. These people have not changed the commonwealth's understanding of science but  increased it.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Who would you say was one of the greatest minds of the 20th/21st century then?

I know Stephen Hawking had a bit of a celebrity around him and that there's some element of marketing and hype, but he's still easily in the top 20 in terms of being a prodigious genius.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Didn‚Äôt forget. Just think Hawking was smarter 
$C: From what I understand Einstein had a relatively average intellect compared to other top-physicists from his era, he just had a special gift to think beyond the usual and pursue it. I could be wrong, though; this is just what I heard.
$C: Yup. Neumann wins hands-down.
$C: As I recall, it's some kind of variation on Lou Gherig's disease. He always called it "motor neuron disease" instead of ALS.


$C: Thank you for the very clear and informative info. 
$C: IIRC he actually had a related motor neuron disease, not ALS. Similar symptoms and life expectancy though.
$C: He was the definition of a fighter. Hawking was the first example of someone being more than their Illness I was ever introduced to, and I admired him for that. 

This is hitting me hard. R.I.P. Stephen Hawking.
$C: My father in law just died a week ago from ALS. He made it 14 months. In October they put him on hospice and said he had something like 2 months to live. We feel blessed that he made it twice that long. It‚Äôs unbelievable how long Mr. Hawking made it. Rest In Peace. 
$C: I read once that the length of time you can survive with it depends heavily on your age when you get it.  Apparently he was in the right age window and, while eventually becoming severely physically disabled, was able to survive.  I believe if you get it when you're older the mortality rate is significantly higher.
$C: Honest question: did the fact he had money help (to afford care, medicine, etc)? It was just that his ALS was a mild variant? Or was it just his will and determination to live?  

EDIT: For people mentioning NHS, does that mean that UK have a  longer life expectancy for ALS? Did the original "two years to live" prognosis considered that? Just in case, I'm not nitpicking, just trying to understand the reason behind his specific outcome (maybe keeping his brain active helped a lot, maybe?)  
$C: What was his secret? Why did he survive so long, when most people die after just a few years?
$C: He had a varient but not Lou Gehrigs. Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you otherwise they are wrong 
$C: Oh shit never knew it was ALS. Think most people end up dying from respiratory failure, wonder how he was able to avoid it. 
$C: wasn't the text-to-speech device revolutionary for the time period when he was gifted?
$C: I wonder if there is any footage of him before the disease
$C: It‚Äôs a horrible disease. With today‚Äôs technology you can live as long as possible with it. It‚Äôs just a good percent choose not too because the toll it takes on the family because you will require around-the-clock care to live.
$C: [deleted]
$C: He was meant to be here a while
$C: Kicking doesn't seem the right term to use here.
$C: I didn‚Äôt know if was for that long. When you say it like that, it‚Äôs incredible. 
$C: And he had children, to boot. Not bad, man.
$C: It's crazy that he had an almost normal lifespan
$C: Its really sad, he lived a fulfilling life.
$C: Imagine the doctor who gave him that prognosis. Hawking probably outlived him lol
$C: IIRC he had a different form of ALS that doesn't kill in the typical 2-5 year slan
$C: Is that the high score for his illness?
$C: >Seriously, he was given 2-4 years and somehow kept on kicking for 55. 

Must've ran on Energizer batteries.
$C: He had an atypical variant of ALS that is noted for its slow and limited progression. He didn‚Äôt outlive his original prognosis so much as it was based on a misdiagnosis. 

His lifespan wasn‚Äôt considered exceptional for someone with his form of ALS. 
$C: ...and now he has kicked the bucket, or well, you know
$C: Is there any actual reason for how he managed for so long? Or was it just meant to be?
$C: I think kicking was one thing he didn't do much of
$C: I think technically he only kept kicking for a few more years. 

$C: He was supposed to be here.
$C: Being rich will do that
$C: Well maybe not *kicking*, but... yeah
$C: Is it possible that keeping himself active with his work kept him alive whereas most people with late stage ALS are much more inactive which makes their condition worsen? 
$C: Poor choice of words, mate.
$C: I honestly assume he was as close to Einstein's idea that if we could fully utilize our minds ability we would no longer need our bodies anymore.

I will just go on believing that he didn't die but instead made the final leap into true conscious energy existence.
$C: [removed]
$C: It's funny how much knowledge we've learned from the man without realizing it. The guy is a hero in our history, may he rest well. 
$C: Nah, 76 is pretty average.

$C: This means another brilliant mind was born today!
$C: makes you wonder if reincarnation is a thing.
$C: Theres some mathematics at work in the universe somewhere ehh
$C: It's also Einstein's birthday.
$C: I calculate the odds at about 3.14159 in 1146.7. 
$C: But also einsteins birthday
$C: he's from the UK, so it's the 14th over there.
$C: Haha, you're right. Maybe, in a way, the universe was telling him to get some rest.
$C: In a million lifetimes? Surely we could have developed ways to reverse or circumvent his disease by then... 
$C: But at least he can rest easy knowing that he left the world a far, far better place than it was.
$C: Its YOUR fault
$C: Me too! That odd timing makes it even more surreal, as if you were just talking to him. 
$C: Please don‚Äôt start reading Ruth Bader Ginsburg‚Äôs book anytime soon...
$C: Yeah, I had just finished watching the movie about his life.  At first I didn't believe it because it seemed too much of a coincidence.
$C: You skimmed over them and didn't retain shit. 
$C: Everyone knows that the queen's old, we've just accepted that she's immortal now
$C: ‚Äòand also Ozzy Osbourne‚Äô
$C: No, don't you even dare think about that, she's immortal as long as she gets a steady supply of the blood of the young!
$C: Starts thinking about Stan Lee And hyperventilating...
$C: I mean Queen Elizabeth's mother lived to be 101, Queen Elizabeth has time.

Poor Charles might ~~be king for like 2 years~~ never be king. We all know Queen Elizabeth will live for another 50 years.
$C: We don't have to worry about the queen going.  We have to worry about Philip going.  He's been her rock for the past 70 years - his passing will be the warning sign.
$C: Don't Harper Lee it
$C: I'm pretty sure she's immortal.
$C: Nah, the queen won't die for at least 20 years. 
Mark my words, there is no way she'll die before hitting 100. 
I'll eat my hat if she does die before then, I'll eat two hats if she does by July this year, I'm so confident.
$C: 'Lie back, and think of England.'
$C: Every time I turn on the news I'm afraid it's gonna be the queen. She's not even my head of state, it's just the next tragedy I'm always expecting.

And then somehow it always manages to be even more jarring than the ascension of Charles III.
$C: Stop that, that's treason
$C: My grandmother was the same age as the queen, and she just died last month.
$C: Long live the Queen!
$C: 'Worried laughter'
$C: And Stan Lee, Betty White, and pretty much any rock star active pre-1975 who is still alive
$C: This year. I'm calling it. For fun, let's say.. August.
$C: [removed]
$C: I'm 35 and in good health think that she's gonna outlive me at this point

RIP Mr. Hawking
$C: I wonder if shell live long enough that there will be no more humans alive older than her. Whrre every living person om the planet was born within her reign
$C: She didn't bite the dust?
$C: Diagnosed with ALS. Lou Gerhigs Disease and he still lived to 76. That's impressive 
$C: He was also repeatedly battling pneumonia, that was the reason he couldn't do the ice bucket challenge anyway
$C: i thought his hands were paralysed long ago, and he had been controlling the computer with that muscle on his cheek

$C: Weirdly enough that is part of what makes it so shocking, at one point he had already survived so long against all odds that you just don't consider him dying a possibility.
$C: I think that's the thing that's getting most people, myself included. He outlived the prediction by decades and everyone kind of thought "why not another year?" 
$C: Limit transferral

$C: He must've been a fighter, he was told he has 2 years left to live in 1963 according to the article
$C: Happy birthday! 
$C: No no, he should keep calling it astrology, thats what friends are for
$C: Wonder is his roommate can fix my chakras they all types of fucked up. 


$C: He just didn't mention his roommate goes to Hogwarts and is sort of nutty about Muggle scientists.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Yeah man but me being fat has nothing to do with this.
$C: He‚Äôs also getting an education certificate (I think that‚Äôs the word for it) and plans to be a college professor one day. 
$C: Uh, doesn‚Äôt crocodile tears mean insincerity?
$C: I had to reread the headline 3 times because I was thinking, "that can't be true".
$C: That wasn't a shoehorn. That was my actual response.
$C: >  social media

Well.  That explains everything.
$C: I know. 

The dream was weird. I got to meet him and I was so happy! And he told me he had died. And I argued with him about it, because....no way! And he just laughed.

He didn't seem upset at all. 

I wasn't upset because I figured he was full of shit, and then realized I was dreaming anyway.
$C: > You'll eventually die!

/r/2meirl4meirl
$C: He knew he was living on borrowed time, it's amazing how much he got. 
$C: "remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet." He embodied this in more ways than one. What a legend. The dude is my hero.
$C: I can relate.
$C: "We are all now connected by the Internet, like neurons in a giant brain." This one makes me see the world like a huge brain with transmissions of communications flashing through it.
$C: "People won't have time for you if you are always angry or complaining."

This one applies so well to so many of us.
$C: Ooh, I like this one! That‚Äôs about the age I was when I was diagnosed with my degenerative genetic illness. (And it‚Äôs basically the attitude I have towards my life with my condition.) I‚Äôve always liked Steven Hawking, but he might be my new hero.
$C: And he lived to be 76, above the life expectancy then
$C: "We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special"
$C: I find this to be a quote I can relate with, although not in the same capacity of course.
$C: Scientifically, he was a stand-up guy who paid his [bets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorne%E2%80%93Hawking%E2%80%93Preskill_bet). (even if he couldn't stand up) 
$C: A genius once said, "I expect nothing, yet I am still disappointed"
$C: It's crazy to think that he was diagnosed with ALS before we had even made it to the moon
$C: That‚Äôs a great one
$C: The power of low expectations. 
$C: This one really gets to me. Especially when facing "big" decisions in my life.
$C: It actually seems like a Douglas Adams quote reworked a little bit. His birthday was a few days ago. Two guys that ‚Äúgot it‚Äù. 
$C: His life makes our difficulties look like a joke. He faced such a struggle, and yet look what he accomplished. 
$C: This explains a lot about his strive in science. 
$C: Sometimes they‚Äôre just fucken retarded though.
$C: "... there probably is no heaven and no afterlife either. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that I am extremely grateful."
$C: [deleted]
$C: He reached the closest thing to being immortal. He will be known for as long as there are humans for helping advance our knowledge. That's better than a disconnected fantasy after life. 
$C: I believe he's kicking himself in the ass for that one right about now. 
$C: He was really annoyed with that voice at first because it gave him an American accent. Once he realized it had become his trademark, he accepted it.

Later, the voice technology had improved so much that no company even bothered to make his primitive, old voice synthesizer any more, but he didn't want to suddenly start "speaking" in a totally different voice, so he had to buy up all of the remaining old voice synthesizers so he would have backups in case his broke.
$C: Well fuck, I am now.
$C: Is there a scientific name for that? It seems many people at times, will mentally see a quote from someone with a unique voice; and "hear" that voice in their brain
$C: You'd think they would've gave him a better more natural voice, but I guess it kinda became his identity
$C: What a great quote. I'm 100% sure that he actually said that. 
$C: It certainly flooded my inbox. I've gotten more than 60 quotes. 
$C: What's the context of this one? Is it related to the Homer Simpson quote that someone else posted, or is it a joke, or is it related in some way to Hawking radiation? 
$C: Not really, you posted too late for anyone to even see your comment. 
$C: That statement could be interpreted multiple ways. 
$C: It was included in his family's [official statement](http://twitter.com/evanmcmurry/status/973767381431603206), which is where I got it from, so chances are good that he actually said that. 

I tried googling the quote to find the source, but all I'm finding are articles on his death.
$C: "Who is the Journal of Physics going to believe?"
$C: Did you solve the anagram, or is that a quote? 
$C: Also the fact that his condition directly lead to companies developing such technology, which will only become more commonplace and refined as time goes on.

Much like technologies invented for military/space exploration purposes that later become available to the general population
$C: So much talent could've been wasted
$C: It's amazing how much one man can contribute to the world. 
$C: Why are you using a post about Stephen Hawking's death to call other people stupid?
$C: People celebrate Kanye because he makes fucking great music.
$C: It's more than just a step further. In most fields you're expected to pursue a post-doctoral fellowship that lasts at least 2 years (I've seen up to 6), by which time you will have had to have amassed dozens of publications reflecting your original research contributions... all just to get a *shot* at becoming an assistant professor. To achieve tenure usually requires another 5 years of productivity, having consistently produced good research during that time.

Hawking wasn't just a full professor either. He was the Lucasian Chair of Mathematics at Cambridge University. That's one of the most difficult and impossible to get positions as a scientist in the entire world. Just to give you an idea of how old and esteemed it is: the position was previously held by Charles Babbage (he invented the concept of the computer), George Stokes (discoverer of the Stokes-Navier equations fundamental to fluid dynamics), Paul Dirac (discovered new subatomic particles and won the Nobel Prize for it), oh and a fellow by the name of Sir Isaac Newton. 
$C: And he was knighted, so it'd be Professor, Doctor, Sir Stephen Hawkings.
$C: RIP Mr. Dr. Professor Hawking.
$C: I‚Äôve travelled in a few academic circles and I‚Äôve never heard of a preference to call someone Professor X over Dr. X.  
  
So when you say ‚Äútypically,‚Äù it makes me think you don‚Äôt know what you are talking about. 
$C: And even without the whole doctor tag, he's Stephen William Hawking CH CBE FRS FRSA
$C: agreed. i would have been fine with just saying Stephen Hawking because he's much more than a degree, but then OP adds Mr which diminishes rather than elevates.
$C: Of note is that "doctor" refers to teaching (latin; think of a word like "doctrine"), which should be more appropriate for PhDs and especially those who become profs.
$C: Still has, even in death.
$C: For example, homeopathy. 
$C: In 1963, at the age of 21, he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease and given two years to live.
$C: It's because he's been more like a force than a person to most of us. A symbol of the power of the human brain to understand its place in the universe. 
$C: "It would not be much of a universe if it wasn't home to the people you love"- Dr. Hawking

Rest up brother. Thank you for your knowledge and creativity
$C: and his voice!
$C: You are never truly gone until the ripples you leave in the world fade. 
$C: ‚ÄúWhen does a man die? When he is hit by a bullet? No! When he suffers a disease? No! When he ate a soup made out of a poisonous mushroom? No! A man dies when he is forgotten!‚Äù
$C: GNU Stephen Hawking
$C: His name was Stephen Hawking
$C: Specifically, the death of the universe or all of humanity, whichever comes first; because he got Hawking Radiation coined after him; which is the slow death of black holes...which won't happen for a few *trillion* years.


$C: Found the atheist.
$C: I feel the same, it's like I lost a close relative. I can't stop the tears, but also feel happy he was able to live a long life under such hardship. He expanded the knowledge of all people, to the benefit of us all. A great man was lost, yet a great legacy will live on.
$C: *stay gold steven, stay gold*
$C: Damnit. That poem always gets me.

I‚Äôm definitely not crying a little bit...
$C: Oh fuck I was ok then I saw the Robert Frost and now i'm not ok.

I couldn't remember the words to this poem for years now, and it's bothered me so much, and here it is.
$C: Stay gold, pony boy!  Stay GOLD.
$C: user name checks out, my friend...
$C: Thats a creative way to ask for reddit gold
$C: Convoluted. Lacking narrative. Jumbled mess.

Applaud you for the effort. Just missed the mark.
$C: I'm glad he managed to live such an intensively productive life despite his condition, and that he got to experience the best care possible and had the best tools available, witnessing remarkable progress throughout his life. With all that he had going against him, he became one of the greatest minds this world has ever seen, his life and mind stand as one of the great testaments to humankind.

With all that he accomplished and experienced, I still wish he had lived long enough to see man landing on Mars.
$C: He has brought such light upon us in the ways of knowledge and enlightenment. I‚Äôll always be thankful for all of the ways he has sparked my imagination when looking into the night sky and allowing myself to see beyond just gleaming stars in the night sky and wonder what‚Äôs past it.
$C: Exactly. It‚Äôs just so odd we were so accustomed to him being there giving us so much knowledge, and now those days are now over. Something that was inevitable, but you never really put the legitimate thought to it. Rest In Peace to this legend   
$C: Wealth inequality, to be a tad more specific. Sucks there are so many current forms of inequality in 2018 prevalent enough to warrant this distinction. 
$C: Never seen this ama. Thanks for sharing!

*Reddit silver*
$C: Well that makes sense. Since no matter how much we innovate too much inequality can hold us back from a true utopia. Which could indeed contribute to things that might put an end to the human race. Right now the world isn't looking too optimistic in this department so I understand why Mr. Hawking felt this way.

Overpopulation has been my main concern throughout my life which mixes very negatively with inequality and uneven distribution of wealth with every citizen.

However I believe he still had a lot of faith and hope in mankind, so we should too.
$C: I would love to give you gold for this, but I'd also love to put money towards fighting this...which warrants a double take, because money seems to be what it all comes back to. The pursuit of it is the end all and be all of most of those in power around the world, in many respects, and thus will be the end all and be all of humanity as a whole. 

But it all started with my desire to point out to others the inherent truth and validity of something on the internet that foreshadows something that could have very real and devastating consequences on life as we know it. 
I'm almost 25 years old.
And I'm scared, anxious for the future.
$C: The next thing you know it'll be the Queen.
$C: Close to immortality if you think about it. He was diagnosed to live 2 more years when he was 21. He died at 76 leaving a hell of a legacy.
$C: Maybe he has just accended?
$C: [deleted]
$C: He‚Äôll always be around just write something in word and have it on speech to text 
$C: Maybe he did.
$C: I'm holding out hope that he did and we'll be seeing his next identity pop up within the next fifty years or so. :(
$C: He did.
$C: I just assumed thr computer took over and figured a failsafe way to pass the Turing test
$C: https://youtu.be/S41HzLQfL-A
$C: He has, were just in the wrong permutation of the multi verse to witness it from his side.
$C: Right? I always imagined him a bit like Nicholas Flamel, and assumed he had a sorcerer's stone. 
$C: His work will be immortal.
$C: He said for humanity to survive, we've got to spread out from Earth. Let's get exploring! 
$C: He also said that the NHS saved his life and was a staunch Labour supporter. Reach for the stars, but remember to take people with you.
$C: The Pope probably tells stories about that time he got to meet Stephen Hawking.
$C: It‚Äôs such a weird feeling for me. Expected, but still somehow unexpected?
$C: I just grasped when I read the title, feels like we just lost a visionary. 

RIP Steven Hawking. Cheers, for all the good the man did the world.
$C: > The world will miss you

Men of science lead people to intellectual evolutions
$C: He actually turned down a knighthood... So, technically you can't call him Sir. But he will be missed anyway...
$C: Oh he did, for 55 years he outsmarted death!
$C: This is the most inspiring thing about him to me. He was supposed to be dead at 23 thanks to a debilitating illness. Yet he kept on pushing himself and instead died at 76 as one of the most successful men on the planet.
$C: And because he basically still lived soo many years despite that fact so it‚Äôs like you expect him to even overcome death again it seems 
$C: 12 inch rims on his chair, that‚Äôs how he rolled y‚Äôall!
$C: I‚Äôd say he was more like Dr Dre.. 

Dr‚Äôs have PhD‚Äôs.. and dre has such a firm grasp on his machine that he literally creates sounds that speak to his audience.
$C: damn snoop gonna die one day...
$C: What an ignorant comparison.
$C: I‚Äôm a huge erb fan so I love this battle and this line especially 
$C: I bet the computer will miss him more than anyone.
$C: I just side eyed the heckin heck out of you. 
$C: Oh, I was just saying that he did live an average lifetime for an average person. Which is absolutely incredible for someone with ALS, of course. He perservered through these challenges because science needed him. 

I have yet to read *A Brief History of Time*, although it has been on my list. This is definitely the turning point of taking action on that. 
$C: Without a doubt. And with the generations he was able to inspire, his legacy will go on. 
$C: For real, today we lost a scientist who fucking paved paths to new theories that has and will lead to discoveries that will change the way we view this universe.

It's hard to believe he's actually gone. :(
$C: Hand to god Brief History is the only book I‚Äôve read more than once...and I‚Äôve read it at least 10 times. 
$C: The air that morning had the consistency of gravy, and sweat gushed out of my body like a bursted Hoover Dam. I needed to cool off or I'd die. So I went inside a library, (airconditioned) and chanced upon a copy of ABHOT. I left the library at 7 o'clock.
$C: Exact same for me. I thought the cover looked cool in elementary school and picked it up from the library. Changed my life forever.
$C: I finished reading it an the grand design only two weeks ago. Crazy man.
$C: Same here
$C: The idea of Hawking radiation still astounds me to this day. The idea that matter can just appear because half of a matter antimatter pair is sucked into a black hole is pretty crazy.
$C: I told him to stop playing kickball by that black hole, but he never listened.
$C: Personal problems? Aside from the obvious?
$C: Who among us doesn't have personal problems though?
$C: I agree. I believe that ALS was such a significant part of his life and how he developed his worldview that he wouldn‚Äôt be Stephen Hawking without it. 
$C: This. People can have incurable or chronic disabilities and illnesses and are just as capable of changing the world, even fundamentally changing the way that everyone else understands our world 
$C: it dramatically slowed down his ability to put his thoughts to paper. writing it down yourself is a lot faster then slowly blinking yes or no to your assistant as she points at each letter on the alphabet.
$C: Depending on what your definition is. I don't think anyone looked at Hawking as a kid and went "that's what I want to be." people like Bill Nye are just as important as researchers like Hawking because they inspire children. I mean, Neil Armstrong didn't build any rockets, but his publicity certainly made more NASA scientists than whoever did. 
$C: Yeah, Nye is a science educator. Hawking has actual contributions to the field of physics and that is why he is famous. A lot of people seem to conflate the two because you have people like Carl Sagan who were both, but Hawking is famous for his actual research first and foremost.
$C: He's not really a scientist-- his training is as an engineer, and then comedy, then science popularization. 
$C: But it makes the point: can you name any living scientists that aren't actually entertainers in science-related fields?
$C: The guy made it to 76 and stamped his name in time with some great accomplishments, can't be sad about that. 
$C: Same. I've never felt emotional about a celebrity passing, Hawking is different. Really sucks.
$C: I know how you feel PM_ME_YOR_PUSSY_GIRL
$C: No, he is a household name. An inspiration to everyone and one of the greatest sciencists
$C: You should read is books. It‚Äôll blow your mind.
$C: That's what happens when you don't have the ability to use your body. Or have sex. You have so much room for activities.

If you want to be like him, get crackin'.
$C: Lol, this is such a random response to that comment. 
$C: Perhaps his greatest achievement. Being on /u/honeypinn's favorite episode of Dexter's Lab. Something we all strive to do. 
$C: I think I'm going to go watch that now
$C: That's professor hawk  **shoobady doobady doo** that's professor hawk!
$C: Truly a great achievement
$C: [Not credited though](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0370071/)
$C: his greatest achievement 
$C: I figured he must have had assistants but trying to communicate to them would have still been quite difficult using his speech system
$C: What else would he be using the equations for?
$C: I love Christopher Lee. I had somehow forgotten that he died. I might have to Marathon some C.L. movies. Such an interesting man.
$C: Well, shit. 
$C: Not gonna lie, I teared up a little typing it. We lost that friend back in November. If there's anything after this where we keep our consciousness, I hope the two of them meet.
$C: It‚Äôs going to hit the #1 New York Times bestseller list once again very soon, I‚Äôm calling it. Even in his death he shall inspire more of us to learn. 
$C: It changed my entire world view 8 years ago and inspired me to study cosmology. 
$C: If that book was too much for you try The Universe in a Nutshell, it's much more accessible.
$C: Well, now it is precedented and it's time to make a precedent for those years to be more easily lived too.
$C: r/IAmVerySmart 

fuck is wrong with you? kid.
$C: Shit. It takes a brilliant son of a bitch to have a plan for after they're dead. 
$C: Sadly, he won‚Äôt. Nobel prizes aren‚Äôt awarded posthumously.
$C: He was also born on the 300th death anniversary of Galileo Galilei. 
$C: I own the Criterion blu ray of it- i plan to watch it and all of the supplements
$C: >Gifs are now placed where roses once were.

Ah yes, for you see, this is the future! 

Is it possible for a comment to be both hilarious and poignant at the same time?
$C: He and his daughter, Lucy, wrote a book together called "George's Secret Key to the Universe". My mother bought that book for me when I was around 11 or 12 years old and it gave me my first glimpse into the world of astronomy and theoretical physics, two areas I now love to know about and despite not studying it academically, I do study it on my own time out of pure interest. Worth reading, or gifting it to your children if you have any.
$C: I think being the first person to show time travel would be quite the accomplishment to be proud of. A lot of his work is already being updated and overshadowed by newer physical theories. In the grand scheme of physics, he actually is not a star player.
$C: and Einstein was born March 14. maybe you're onto something. Ray Bradbury out-lived them all, though. 
$C: Standing on the shoulders of giants and all that.
$C: Uh, I'm not "shitting" on anything. 
$C: And Albert Einstein's birthday :'( 
$C: Slow down!
$C: Barack Obama, of course.


$C: A nut lasts a few moments. A good book lasts forever. - Stephen Hawking

EDIT: I‚Äôm sorry if you guys find this disrespectful. I‚Äôm actually entering a bit of a depressive spiral due to this. When someone dies I tend to try to make light of it. I have nothing but the greatest respect for the man and I will be raising a drink to his honor tonight.
$C: that's what she said, very brief 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Would you like to start in safe mode?

(((evil stare)))
$C: Windows 10 doesn't have a shutdown sound.
$C: No wonder he decided to call it quits.
$C: Yeah right. Like I'm ever going to get a 19 INT from 3d6 ever again.
$C: It's gone back and forth a few times in the past few minutes.
$C: oh damn, didnt even think about that
$C: I heard it had a highway do maybe he could just roll on that
$C: Hell has better company anyway.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Weird how God hears your prayers and heals the sick, [but never cures ALS](https://whywontgodhealamputees.com/).
$C: Heaven is a Judeo-Christian concept. Maybe he gets reincarnated into something awesome. Like the person that becomes the world's first cyborg astronaut, doctor, cowboy. 
$C: Why are people trying so hard to mispresent his words? They did the same with Einstein and he needed to mention it in one of his books.

"What I meant by 'we would know the mind of God' is, we would know everything that God would know, if there were a God. Which there isn't. I'm an atheist." Stephen Hawking

$C: [deleted]
$C: The big foreplay
$C: The lil' bang
$C: I made it maybe 80 pages in before he completely lost me. He had a dizzying intellect.
$C: I read that in 1994, and OC didnt cite it.  My bad, I forgot.

But Im still correct.
$C: Keep downvoting don't answer question.
$C: At least that question has practical applications.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Um, what part of his "mathmatics" contributed to physics and PI? I am curious. And yes I realize the Pi is important, but what did he do about it?
$C: How am i subtle, I am being aggressive... Please explain. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Retire from what? thinking?
$C: Can you provide a link for it?
$C: I know I just hope there is another Hawking out there 
$C: Sure then lets compare Steven Hawking to your uneducated PHD physics professor that lives in your area. Does that make it a good analogy? You played yourself. 
$C: What was your joke
$C: That's right!!!! Not funny at all. That voice box will live for at least 10-20 more years. Rest in Peace my ass?!?!?!
$C: Because they live empty lives without substance.

Edit: nevermind, it looks like he has a series of bots who argue with each other. The 'popular' bot is likely sold to ad companies or Russians down the line to look like a legitimate user.
$C: Lmao. A scientific theory is not a guess, idiot.
$C: You misundersand what a scientific theory is.
$C: Really? What scientific theory have been changed to the point that they are discredited? Gravity? Evolution? That was an incredibly ignorant statement.
$C: I don't think you know how theory works. You probably shouldn't comment if you don't have a clue what you're talking about.
$C: Yeah, this is nonsense.  Fuckin' Dunning Kruger, man.
$C: Edumacate yourself: https://youtu.be/wNDGgL73ihY
$C: > black holes don‚Äôt exist...observing movement around empty space doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs something in that space

Lol wut. For stars at the galaxy‚Äôs core to orbit a point in space, there has to be an object of tremendous mass creating a gravitational field. Things don‚Äôt orbit empty space. That‚Äôs not how the universe works 

EDIT: I just checked your comment history, and apparently spacetime doesn‚Äôt exist either, despite GR being one of the most successful scientific models ever created. You have absolutely no knowledge of physics or reality. Please stop spreading these false statements. 
$C: Holy shit
$C: I'm just gonna assume troll because I haven't heard something this stupid in a long time

Edit: I'll bite. What exactly is wrong with the current BBT model and what does this "electric" theory fix in what is wrong? How can you explain that as we have gotten better and better technology that observations of things such as the expansion rate of the universe fit more and more in line with the BBT and GR?
$C: Why would you speak so confidently when you are clearly incredibly ignorant on the subject? I just don‚Äôt understand why people do this.
$C: Lol how many years have you spent studying this?
$C: Better than your alt too 
$C: one of the world's greatest minds have just died. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that I'm a bit justified in being a little bit sensitive over people who literally kicks others while they're down. 
$C: [removed]
$C: That‚Äôs certainly a generalization. I always thought that the guy was a dick, but not everyone who is smart is a dick
$C: Using peoples post history and grammar to argue against an internet stranger is sad.  Also, hawking was apparently a giant prick to his wives.  People have opinions, and even astrophysicists are nuanced and not above criticism.  Of course the Reddit neckbeards will downvote any criticism of him.
$C: Hey guys, I looked through his post history and it turns out this guy is an alt right blumpf supporter. Downvote and carry on fellow redditors.
$C: why would I care about that nerd shit?
$C: I was being sarcastic, but oooooook
$C: Yeah, it's not like the word "Scientist" is right next to his name in the title.
$C: Low effort trolling. Try again.
$C: Obvious troll is obvious.
$C: That's racist...
$C: As I said, I am fine with offensive humour. Simply being mean about a great man who just died seems shitty to me though.
$C: Yes, but saying such is a form of denying everything he‚Äôs studied and personally believed.  The mans dead, can‚Äôt you respect his views 
$C: Yeah, man.  I don't know why anyone would downvot you.  There is nothing contradictory about god and science.  Science is what it is, and if you believe in God, you can believe that he made the rules we rely on.  And if you rely on the rules of Science, there is nothing that said God didn't create those rules. 
$C: Sorry but your beliefs are unbiblical. Stop calling yourself Christian. You are a deist.
$C: shut the fuck up.
$C: [deleted]
$C: This is willful scientific ignorance you're displaying here, imbecile
$C: > doesn't affect anybody's life in any way

fucking lol. they have massive implications on every person's life every day. 
$C: ‚ÄúThe right isn‚Äôt racist‚Äù 
$C: Username checks out
$C: I was thinking "sandpaper on an asshole" pleasant, but I like yours better.
$C: Lol, you know we do understand how black holes come to be right? But the point is that even if we dont know how something came to be, the lazy explanation that some magical being created it is stupid. People also used to think rainbows and lightning were the work of gods as well. 
$C: You are living a fucking joke. You seriously  think some useless ass troll like yourself is getting into Heaven just because on your death bed you say a prayer. 
$C: Shut up you incel fuckboy.
$C: You imbeciles never seem to take a break.
$C: Considering the thread we‚Äôre in... No, it cannot stop
$C: Can‚Äôt take a joke?
$C: You guys fighting?
$C: The Christian bible? I don't recall the passage about Hawking being resurrected twice l
$C: You understand how journalism works right? it takes time to write up a story, get it edited and then uploaded. The fact you straight up called out CNN for no reason just proves regardless of how fast they had a story up you'd find a reason to shit on it.
$C: Thanks for clarifying. 
$C: In modern science, ideas and theories are put forward, tested and then discarded if they don't seem to fit with the rest of our understanding of reality. 

The purpose of science, when used properly, is to further our understanding of the universe and to improve everyone's lives. It's deeply ironic that this thing you hate so much is what allows you to spread your message on this forum in the first place. Someone you care for or maybe even yourself is still alive today because of medical advancements. All of the comforts that you take absolutely for granted, guess what, also science. 

Religion, on the other hand, is a tool for political control. Let's be real, that's what it is. People are innately superstitious, so if you're in the right place at the right time you can mold their superstitions into ideals that benefit you. 

The Catholic Church grew obscenely rich as a result. Ironically, the reformists themselves, as is human nature, followed in their footsteps when they got into power. 

But hey, if you hate science, here's a list of things for you to give up:

- Absolutely anything electronic (computers, smartphones, TVs, etc)

- Modern medicine. Have fun with being "bled" for every disease. Hope your "humours" are doing well! Anesthetics? What are those? Try getting drunk before the ~~surgeon~~ butcher works on you.

You'll probably die before 40 of some "incurable" disease that all that bullshit science has wiped out. [ENJOY DEALING WITH THESE.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases)

- Any sort of automated vehicle. Your fastest mode of transportation is now *the horse*. This also means no more mechanized agriculture, hopefully the harvest is good, else you'll starve to death. Flying, of course, is for birds only.

- Electricity. Nope, no electricity for you. That's too "sciency" - so, no refrigeration, no lighting (stock up on candles!).

I'll leave more for you to think up, nearly everything you do or enjoy today is influenced by science. 

Scientific progress will probably extend your lifespan beyond what your parents and grandparents experience, nevermind even older generations.  Some diseases that would've been death sentences even 30 years ago (like certain cancers) are now manageable.. etc

So yes, it has "just as much bullshit", except one radically transformed your life to the point that a person from 300 years ago would think you're some sort of deity, while the other just wants control over your mind to self-perpetuate itself. 
$C: Zeus bless you too.

Let's put it this way, you feel threatened by the Muslims?  Believe it or not, your god is also Allah (which isn't anything more than the title god, not a name.) Like Christians have the old testament and New testament... The Muslims have the old testament and the Qur'an.  The Jewish Torah is just the old testament... So you guys all worship the same god, no different.  The only difference is Muslims don't acknowledge the new testament, and Christians don't acknowledge the Qur'an.  Many different Christian sects believe their way is the only way even though the only difference between Baptists and Catholics is interpretation and presentation...
$C: Maybe they already tried once, failed, and can't risk bumping into themselves again. Doctor Who taught me something!
$C: Yes but you can never return forward. I mean who do you think Donald trump is? He is obviously a guy who went to the past to try being Biff from back to the future because if your a time travel scientist your also a back to the future buff. Anyways he realized he is stuck in the early nineties when he went bankrupt and tried to pull the time chord. But because he had changed it so much he could no longer return to his original timeline. So he figured fuck it lets be president.  
$C: Remember that party Hawking threw? Bunch of people showed up, It was wild. 
$C: Maybe there are paralel universes. One where they did decide to go anyway and one where they didn't. We live in the boring one.
$C: That's what you did the first time, but you just keep fucking it up because you're such a fuckup.
$C: best comment ever :D
$C: Unless Biff becomes president
$C: You can, but having multiple you in one place fucks things up a bit
$C: yeah. im waiting until my time as the chosen one comes because im just assuming im going to steal a time machine and alter the timeline permanently, breaking us free from the reality loop.

Before I do that though, im going to every party in history. might as well have fun and find out what my role was in all the historic events.

I know its a huge assumption to make, but I feel it in my blood.
$C: This is timely irony.
$C: I know the history, I was implying that people from the future could've come and told him to lie to the public.
$C: I like to think that it was a trap and he killed them to preserve the space-time continuum
$C: Parallel timeline. Going back in time adds a new timeline , obviously. 
$C: How do you patent a bed?
$C: With that game, you go in and it‚Äôs been a month.
$C: I have nearly 700 hours on Eu4, pretty much entirely with the MEIOU and taxes mod, and have yet to complete a game.
$C: "Sir, we're going to have to take you downtown."

"I AM SUFFERING FROM TEMPORAL DISORIENTATION"
$C: We're talking about time travellers here, people 500 years from now are going to look on TV interviews as we look on symbols etched on stone in the present day. So they might want to visit his funeral.
$C: I can almost hear the robot voice going "ha ha."
$C: He was supposed to die when *My father was born*
$C: He stated himself that never occurred...but he could see it in his doctors eyes that he didn‚Äôt have much longer. 
$C: What if he actually died 1965?
$C: He left quite a tall bar for other ALS sufferers to go for.
$C: My father passed from ALS when he was 49. He lasted about two years. It depends also where it starts. For some it‚Äôs their extremities but for my dad, it was his chest. He was a boxer and worked out everyday. His doctors said he lasted as long as he did only because of his health before it. It‚Äôs a horrible illness and I hate it with a passion. I saw my Superman go from muscles to bones in a matter of months. I wish you and your mom the best and I hope she‚Äôs able to fight it for as long as possible. 
$C: My grandfather was diagnosed with als in either ‚Äò98 or ‚Äò99 and he‚Äôs still alive! In fact, he‚Äôs still speaking!  It progresses differently in everyone that has it.  Not an easy thing to watch though. 
$C: Okay.

Is there any pathology on how one gets ALS? Is it a genetic disease? Is it something one acquires? I'm honestly curious. How does somebody acquire ALS?
$C: Do you like vanilla or chocolate?
$C: How do they manage to make them swallow? Do they squeeze their throat or something?
$C: I imagine it will be some day.
$C: S.S. Hawking 
$C: Here‚Äôs hoping that Elon is paying attention to this thread. 
$C: Hawking you are cleared for docking.
$C: And the computer better have his computer voice. 
$C: Captain Pike's ship after the enterprise should be the Hawking.
$C: Hawking and Starwind Enterprise
$C: USS Hawking McHawkingface
$C: "I won't leave the hawking!  its my ship only!"
$C: The U.S.S. Hawking sounds like a bad ass name for a spaceship.
$C: Every chipset better have a radiation edition with RGB lighting.
$C: Nah, first colony 
$C: I raise 10 betting it's not.
$C: as a fan of retro computers I understand more than anyone. retro computer sound devices really had a unique synthetic science fictiony tone. It really was fitting. I still listen to mod music and old synthetic voices sometimes lmao.
$C: I had no idea he was English until I read about his death this evening. Absolutely thought he was American.
$C: The preferred term is "Robot-American".
$C: No he thought in Hawking
$C: We need to find the next genius that was born on March 14.

$C: There‚Äôs so much weird shit like this throughout history that there‚Äôs no way there‚Äôs not some big troll god up there giving himself a laugh at all the historic conspiracies he‚Äôs created
$C: And also on Pi's Day (3/14)
$C: Hold on, lemme get my tinfoil pirate hat out of the tbell bag over there. 
$C: May the cycle continue, i guess.
$C: Fucking ides of March, man. :(
$C: Years later, my brother and I discovered the new genius, a chemist named Aang.
$C: Early hours of Wednesday morning (the 14th) at home - presumably the UK, so GMT - is the story I‚Äôve seen.
$C: Fake news
$C: That seems like it's wondering what it's like to know them or interact with them. 

I never got to meet Hawking and don't feel I have any special insight as to what he was like just for having lived at the same time.
$C: Imagine how out of place you would feel sitting in that same room
$C: He was certainly a top rate theoretical physicist but nowhere near as accomplished as the true greats of the 20th century such as Heisenberg, Pauli, Dirac, Feynman, let alone Einstein or Newton. So I guess a ‚Äúthird-rate great physicist‚Äù would be kind of an apt description. He did not contribute anything that truly revolutionized the field in a fundamental way. But he got a lot of fame from his best selling books and his incredible resilience in the face of his disability.
$C: Complete opposite of the historic Isaac Newton who detested any form of criticism
$C: It's funny how the majority of mainstream researchers now a days have forgotten that science is driven by being wrong. So many stake their careers on single studies or papers and then fight any criticism to their death at the sake of the larger conversation. Hawkings was an outlier. 
$C: Actually a lot of scientists didn't like him around when he wrote A Brief History.
$C: i have so many questions
$C: Watch "The Theory of Everything"
Fascinating biopic.  Eddie Redmayne crushes.

SPOILER: For sure cheated on his wife, though.

**"Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change."**

That's a quote attributed to Hawking which always stuck with me, and few did it better than the man himself.  




$C: This might sound condescending but I mean it in the most genuine way.

Literally how?
$C: With his nurse, whose computer engineer husband built his first wheelchair speech computer..

Wonder if he programmed in her safe word
$C: The man had more game than all of us while being paralyzed, and sounding like R2D2 fucked a speak and spell.
The man was a god 

$C: The man was slaying pussy.
$C: He didn't believe in monogamy.

$C: I think the *ability* to cheat on his wife many years after he was supposed to die is more impressive than the cheating itself. Tbh I wouldn't even be mad if my debilitated partner with ALS who had trouble even communicating was still able to get laid. 
$C: She cheated on him too. I don't think it was a suprise for either of them.
$C: we don‚Äôt talk about that
$C: She was a bitch and deserved it.
$C: Don't cheat on your significant other folks. If you think "I'm too smart to get caught" just ask yourself...are you smarter than Stephen Hawking? I'm willing to bet the answer is "No".
$C: He didn't believe in monogamy.
$C: If that's the worst thing everyone is coming up with, then he sounds like a really cool dude.
$C: [He's credited in his stuff with Matt Groening](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0370071/)
$C: Dude I'm so sorry to know about that. I hope you're currently able to channel those experiences into positive ones. Best of luck!
$C: [deleted]
$C: Is it possible to learn this power?
$C: 50 years actually. Pretty sure he was diagnosed in his early 20's?
$C: 40? Try 55!

He was given 2 years in 1963.
$C: 53 years, actually. He was diagnosed at 22.
$C: Secretly prove string theory. Now I kinda hope they put a few of his particles into the Hadron on the off chance that something amazing happens. 
$C: Based on a marketing perspective probably neil degrasse tyson
$C: At a guess, Elon Musk.
$C: [When he was younger](https://imgur.com/sVrniZO)

I tried to find the video of him running over jim carrey but I couldnt :(

Incredible man.
$C: Not the time or place to preach your shit. 
$C: And when you die, you'll have to explain why you were such a judgemental piece of shit instead of trying to be a moral role model like your religion demands.
$C: Well, I guess that depends on what one's interpretation of "fulfillment" means.
$C: Holy shit, what was going on in your head while you were making this comment? Hawking was a much more enlightened person than yourself.
$C: You know your Creator? Wanna give me his number?
$C: Is this a troll account?
$C: > Sadly this dude hated God so his life was not even close to being as fulfilling as mine since I actually know my Creator and worship Him

You waste your days worshipping a false deity and yet have the nerve to say that your life is more fulfilling? 

I will not waste my days believing in something that has no proof just so I can feel better about death. I'm glad that your beliefs help death feel better for you, but trolling/copy and pasting this garbage isn't helping anyone.
$C: Yep from what I can remember (its been a while) the documentary claimed that since he lost the ability to move he basically had to think about physical movements with his mind.
$C: Maximise your happiness by telling every patient they're gonna die in a week.
$C: That's a pet peeve of mine as well. I always hate when people say someone making an amazing recovery is 'defying doctors'. The doctors, nurses, and support staff are the ones that are facilitating the recovery, giving a realistic prognosis is not a bad thing. Imagine people saying that a person 'defied doctors' by dying within a month when given a prognosis of several years.
$C: It wouldn't, and OP doesn't really mean that. It's more the "fuck you" you tell your friends when they predict you can't finish that pizza, or the shaken fist at some quasi-anthropomorphic conception of fate.
$C: I think maybe they meant more of a "fuck you" to dying within 2 years than a "fuck you" to the doctors. 
$C: It's a fuck you to the condition
$C: Meh I've heard people say it, I think it's more the personification of disease on the ones who diagnose it. I had a little old lady who outlived her cardiologist who told her she'd die in a year. She saw it as sticking it to him but was also very grateful for the care he gave her that allows her to live. Was more of a friendly and respectful fuck you. I think that's the context here. People are weird. 
$C: The mind of a simpleton who see doctors as dealers of death rather than harbingers. 
$C: It's what the rest of us in society call "a figure of speech."
$C: During the party, I wonder if he momentarily had some butterflies in his stomach, wondering: "Gee, what if someone really does show up?"
$C: Nobody showed up because that day in history was banned from time traveling to prevent us knowing their existence.
$C: Hadn't heard of this, understandably a brilliant move.
$C: It never even occurred to me that they could do that lol
$C: That would be like someone asking you if you want a new voice after 60 years. The machine voice became *his* voice.
$C: Boom shocka locka boom shocka locka boom is what I remember most
$C: People don't even like it when their Facebook layout gets changed. I would imagine the robot voice felt like *his* voice to him.
$C: I imagine that's what Family Guy does
$C: Considering they were made by 60% of the same people I think the answer is yes. If you listen to the commentaries for either show, the writers and producers were always excited and enthusiastic about guest-stars. And David X. Cohen, who co-developed Futurama with Matt Groening, holds a science degree from Harvard. I'm sure he geeked out whenever Hawking was on the show!
$C: As far as I know, there weren't *any* living real people who appeared on Futurama who weren't voiced by the real person.
$C: Now he‚Äôs looking at the church in the night sky
Wondering whether God‚Äôs gonna say hi
$C: Jokes on you he still... shit
$C: well, jokes on you, he's ah  shit

yeezy  help us
$C: Given his health, he lived a long and great life.
$C: He was one of the world's most brilliant physicists, but by age 26 Einstein had proposed special relativity, instigated serious thought about quantum mechanics, and explained Brownian motion thereby quashed the last bits of doubt about atomic theory. Within ten years he had proposed general relativity, one the crown jewels of modern physics, and later in life had accidentally helped spur further research and study of QM by making very pointed and important criticisms of the theory. His contributions were fundamental and extraordinarily important, and there's been no physicists since Einstein that have brought about such an extreme paradigm shift. Only Newton and Maxwell can really be compared in terms of importance.

Once again, this is not to say Professor Hawking *wasn't* important, he made numerous contributions cosmology in general and black hole physics in particular, but he can not be compared to Einstein.
$C: Not the guy you're asking, but Hawking wrote a really good paper and became an extremely famous communicator of science, despite his obvious disadvantages. He was brilliant, but he didn't really change science.

There's an idea in the general populace that huge developments in physics are the results of individual people making amazing breakthroughs, but that isn't really how it works. Particularly, it seems that it's assumed that people who are amazing in one small niche will inevitably spill their talent into other parts of the field and be an important figure to other scientists working in generally related areas.

In practice, this isn't really true. The best modern scientists don't revolutionise everything - they probably don't revolutionise much at all. They just come up with some really good stuff that is applied where it's relevant and thus benefit the field as a whole.

The reason people think this is partly media narratives and romanticisation, but it's also partly Einstein. Einstein literally changed the state of physics in three serious ways - Brownian motion, explaining the photoelectric effect and of course relativity. Oh, and he did all of those in 1905. After that, he continued pushing out work that we still rely on today (Bose-Einstein statistics, for example).

Saying that Hawking isn't a modern Einstein isn't to slight Hawking - it's just a valid appreciation of how much Einstein contributed and in how many places.
$C: Einstein is a very unique person whose contributions are up there with Newton. Stephen Hawking, only a few decades later, contributed something very important but nowhere near as revolutionary as Einstein‚Äôs relativity. It‚Äôs like saying some middle schooler who is good at swim team is the school‚Äôs Micheal Phelps. It might be true, but it‚Äôs a rather ridiculous turn of phrase. 
$C: I feel like the comparison is ridiculous and any cursory study of history of science would show that. Stephen Hawking was a good scientist. Einstein is one of the most important scientist to ever exist. That‚Äôs like calling that dude who solved one of the millennium problems the Euclid of his time, or maybe the Galois. He‚Äôs a good mathematician, he‚Äôs not Euclid or Galois. 
$C: Pick a random physics professor and (s)he'll have made more contributions to physics than Tyson. He has a phd, but is not a working scientist and never really were. Comparing him to Einstein is like comparing Bill Murray and Michael Jordan as basketball players because they were both in space jam. 
$C: I would say greater minds (Einstein is the obvious example). If he didn‚Äôt have ALS he wouldn‚Äôt be nearly as venerated as he currently is being. He was a smart man. It isn‚Äôt insulting to literally not be the greatest mind of a century. Most physicist would probably kill to make the contributions he had made. But it‚Äôs rather hyperbolic to say he was the greatest, or even equal to the greatest. And if we broaden the scope to more than just physics, I would argue that he‚Äôs even less impressive. I would usually think the comparison is unfair, but he did talk about topics that are not physics so I think it‚Äôs fair to broaden the scope. 
$C: I think the idea of a ‚Äúgreatest mind‚Äù is ridiculous and impossible to measure in any meaningful way. My favourite minds currently would probably be like.... Joyce, Bahktin, Deleuze and Guattari, Pynchon, Federici, and Fanon. But I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre the greatest (er.... I personally think Joyce is up there with Shakespeare) because that would be impossible to measure. I can only have my favourites. And I study literature and theory/phil and am a writer so I obviously have a bias for the minds that I like. I also don‚Äôt think it would be wrong to say Hawking was one of the greatest minds, I have a problem with people saying he is the greatest mind. But if you want physicist I would place Bohr and Einstein above Hawking. 
$C: Exactly. He lived more than half the 20th century, with the entirety of his academic work being done in this tenure. Come on, people.
$C: Intelligence is hard to measure, but he wasn‚Äôt the most influential. That honor goes to Einstein, hands down.
$C: Well you‚Äôd have to make a really, really compelling argument for him then. Einstein isn‚Äôt the most famous physicist for nothing. His theory of relativity completely revolutionized our modern understanding of physics, arguably the most important contribution since Newton‚Äôs Laws of Motion. What he did for modern physics is what harnessing electricity did for civilization.This is not even mentioning the staggering volume of other groundbreaking papers he‚Äôs authored.
$C: You are very, very wrong.

What is "intellect" to you? If formulating a comprehensive scientific theory defining the very rules in which our current understanding of *reality* functions is possible with an "average intellect", you'd think humanity would be a quasi-dimensional species that has figured out how to manipulate spacetime itself by now. 

People that make/parrot that ignorant statement are the biggest irony. They couldn't even be bothered to do a simple Wikipedia search to confirm their outrageous claims to begin with.
$C: You're thinking of Richard Feynman.
$C: Because he's british, and we tend to use MND rather than ALS for all forms of MND including the ALS subtype.
$C: ALS is like 20 different diseases and we aren't to the point where we understand them very well.
$C: That may be due to him being British, and living in Britain. Over here, ALS isn‚Äôt really used as a term like it is in America, instead we use the umbrella term Motor Neurone Disease.
$C: Lou Gherig wasn't a cricket player. 
$C: Motor Neuron Disease is what British people call ALS. It's the same thing.

Edit: Ignore me. Read below. Unless that person is also just a casual Googler with confidence. What are the odds?
$C: Lou gherigs is moter neuron
$C: it's the disease everyone did the ice bucket challenge for. The freezing water interacted with muscles in a way that simulated what the experience of someone going through ALS felt like
$C: It really is amazing. ALS is fucking awful. The fact that he lasted so long is almost as incredible as his intelligence.
$C: UK MND includes ALS.
$C: [Nope, ALS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking#Disability)
$C: I'm sorry for your loss.  I hope a cure is found soon
$C: He is (was?) from the UK, so he has NHS and he always defended it saying that without it he would not have lived so long.

http://www.bbc.com/news/av/health-40990288/stephen-hawking-i-wouldn-t-be-here-without-the-nhs
$C: Probably that he lived in the UK. Long live the NHS. Money will have helped as well, in that he‚Äôll have been able to afford 24 hour care and top of the range tech for wheelchairs etc. 
$C: I don‚Äôt think money had a lot to do with it. It certainly helped him later in life with the care he needed but he didn‚Äôt survive because of money. I doubt it was much will to live either. I think it was mostly luck.  Will to live can be great but plenty of rich people who still want to live don‚Äôt get so lucky with this disease. I‚Äôm very glad he was able to keep going and contribute so much.  His determination to study and work and write and use his genius with the hardships he had to endure are what are truly his strengths.
$C: No one knows why. 

Since his diagnosis, science has advanced. It is now known that those diagnosed younger (most were 55-75, hawking was 21) tend to live longer. It has also been [proposed](https://www.livescience.com/61354-stephen-hawking-turns-76-als-survival.html) that "ALS is probably 20 or more different diseases when one considers the genetic underpinnings," Geraci said. Some of these genetic differences appear to affect various aspects of the disease, including survival." 

 Ultimately the rate of progression varies in each person, and Hawking is an outlier. 

No doubt the standard of care helps, both personal and with the NHS. But that's nowhere near the entire story.
$C: There was nothing mild about his condition.
$C: Universal healthcare. Just think about how many brilliant Americans have wasted away because we believe that the poor deserve to be sick. 
$C: The variant of ALS he had played a big part. It seems that he had a rare early-onset but slow progressing form of the disease. That said I'm sure his background and perseverance didn't hurt.

Source: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stephen-hawking-als/
$C: > did the fact he had money help  
  
You tellin me if my grandma's in the NBA, right now she would be okay?
$C: It was definitely a pretty unusual case. Most people only get diagnosed between 40 and 70, but Hawking found out at 21. That was an immense help to him living as long as he did. He used that time well, and did a lot to raise awareness of the disease.
$C: His secret was that we don't understand ALS very well.
$C: So if you don't beat death you didn't accomplish anything? lol
$C: And the world is so much better for it 
$C: To be fair, I doubt he'd agree with that point from a philosophical standpoint. But I do agree that if one were to believe in some sort of divine intervention, Hawking is a pretty good case
$C: Somehow I don't think Stephen would agree with this.
$C: He would reject such supernatural assertions. 
$C: No one is meant to be here.
$C: "god had a lot of women he wanted me to cheat on my wife with."
$C: He was a holistic physicist.
$C: we are all meant to be here a while on this blessed day :)
$C: We needed him; and he delivered.
$C: He was meant to die today on Pi day as well.
$C: Exactly what a physicist would say. 
$C: I would think that he would have a problem with what you just said.  Stephen was a scientist and he would probably conclude that nothing was "meant" to be anything.
$C: He kept on rollin
$C: Yeah, too soon bro. 
$C: Yeah, the ALS should have taken him out in his 20's.  I don't think anyone else with it has lived even close to as long as he did.
$C: In the US, more than half of men die before 80 so his lifespan seems normal to me.
$C: His wheelchair?
$C: >I will just go on believing that he didn't die but instead made the final leap into true conscious energy existence.

If this were the case (that he didn‚Äôt die but transcended the physical plane, leaving his useless physical body behind), I‚Äôd like to imagine that he did it in one of 3 ways:

1. He uploaded his consciousness to a computer or the cloud. It‚Äôs only a matter of time before he goes all Age of Ultron on everyone, but in a more effective way.

2. He abandoned his physical form to become a being of pure energy ‚Äî a real life Force ghost.

3. Having a complete mastery of theoretical physics, he‚Äôs using this knowledge to figure out how to come back, Dr. Manhattan style. Just give this one a few months.
$C: It's honestly kind of astonishing how much he could've accomplished with _just_ his brain.  He didn't get his computer voice until the mid 1980's.  His health started deteriorating at around the 70's.  That's 15 solid years of his body failing on him and having really no solutions and he _still_ pushed the field of physics.

I can barely keep my notes straight, this guy managed to do complex equations and keep everything in his mind for a better part of a decade.
$C: It turns out, Stephen Hawking was an Ancient.
$C: Yeah, but we all know the ancients are dicks and won't let him come back to help us. Even if Anubis returns to kill us all.
$C: The human mind is essentially information. Information cannot be destroyed. So.. Where do we go?
$C: Na he ded
$C: Is..  is Stephen Hawking Luke Skywalker?
$C: His condition was besically milder than initially expected.  In a sense, he did beat the odd as he's a bit lucky.  No amount of money can save you if you have actual super deadly terminal disease.

On the other hand, the medical experience and knowledge we have gained from trying to keep him alive could potentially save millions of people with similar condition.
$C: Average or not, it's a long fucking time.  I can guarantee I won't make it that far, plenty of people don't live that long. 
$C: That brilliant mind's name? 

Albert Einstein.
$C: Or in 300 years a brilliant mind will be born. 
$C: Seriously though, the coincidence.
$C: No it doesn't. If it was a different day we would have found another scientist in history.
$C: /r/nevertellmetheodds
$C: Oh you're right my bad, I should've read the article first. 
$C: I didn't realize that's where he's from. He didn't even have an accent.
$C: But in the UK, pi Day doesn't really exist because 14.3
$C: it's the 14th DAY.

day / month / year is how everyone but america reports dates.

today is 14/3
$C: In a million lifetimes he might have done it himself!
$C: She'll outlive the lot of us. 
$C: And Betty White too
$C: That steady diet of baby blood really shows.
$C: Its all those swans she eats. 
$C: Her Enduring Majesty
$C: I swear if the Queen actually dies I don't know what I'll do.
$C: I'd expect the queen (even though she sucks the life out of babies, most likely) to go before Ozzy.  Ozzy Osbourne has been studied in labs because of his ability to survive all kinds of overdoses and shit that would normally have killed a person and he apparently has a lot of genetic traits making him incredibly survivable.
$C: And Keith Richards

$C: Stan Lee and Mel Brooks.

$C: Please, Ozzy is an anomaly, Keith Richards is something else entirely....
$C: At the end of time it's going to be her and Keith Richards laughing at all of our bones.
$C: I was gonna say this, I‚Äôm glad someone else did!
$C: You mean tea?
$C: I swear to fucking god. If Stan Lee goes, I'm gonna be pissed. 
$C: Im pretty sure stan lee is worth enough to disney theyll give him whatever tech theyre making to resurrect Walt.

$C: For them all to be born under her reign, she'd have to be about 26 years older than the next oldest person.

It'll probably still happen, but just pointing that out.
$C: Yeah, afaik pneumonia is pretty common in bedridden or sedentary people. It's a stroke, or a broken hip, or a damaged back that puts you down, but the pneumonia takes your life. Got my grandfather after he had a stroke and a fall.

Why would he have needed to spread als awareness? He could have just gone outside...
$C: This is correct he started using his cheek in 2005 according too wikipedia.
$C: Really? Thanks for the clarification.
$C: More so than usual, though. 
$C: Death is caused by swallowing small amounts of saliva over a long period of time 
$C: This is your life, and it‚Äôs ending one minute at a time...
$C: 50% of the people with his illness don't live more than 3 years, and only 10% make it more than 10. I think the guy who was previously behind him in terms of surviving als has lived 40 years after his diagnosis.  His life all that time was definitely impressive, not to mention all he accomplished being like that.
$C: Just gotta realign your crystals. 
$C: Astrology is horoscopes. Astronomy is what they meant to write but didn't realize their error.

$C: Does it? 
I thought it means you‚Äôre crying hard, so lots of tears, big tears, therefore crocodile tears because crocodiles are very big. 
English isn‚Äôt my native language, so it‚Äôs quite possible I‚Äôm misunderstanding the meaning  of this say. 
$C: He lived an average lifespan despite overwhelmingly bad odds, it's truly incredible!
$C: "Everyone has a plan, until they get punched in the mouth" - Mike Tyson         

Edit: mouth not face
$C: Really puts things into perspective. We could all benefit from having this sort of attitude, even if we don‚Äôt have life-threatening illnesses. 
$C: Descartes's "I think therefore I am" might have had special meaning to him.  He spent decades resisting the normal outcome of his condition by way of insisting that his intellectual life continue.  No matter how much technology was required to hear him speak, he always had something to say.  The hunger for new ideas and the chance to make a valuable contribution to human understanding -- that sort of thing probably carries more weight than the usual motivations to soldier on with a body in the process of shutting down.
$C: I never knew how humble he truly was...
$C: We're all on borrowed time, he just understood it
$C: It‚Äôs what drove the man to achieve what he did, if only we all realised at a young ripe age of 21 that we are all living on borrowed time. Human kind would achieve so much more.
$C: Feel bad for the bugger he borrowed it from.
$C: And waaaaay beyond the life expectancy of someone with his condition. I knew someone with ALS and it was a pretty sharp decline from his diagnosis. Sadly, his life ended about 10 years before Hawking's even with a much later onset of the disease.
$C: Read the quote, and then your statement. Doesn't add up in my head. I get the sentiment, but I think too many people are in here trivializing their own accomplishments because his are so daunting. 

We all have roles to play, and naturally the choice is yours. Have you ever made somebody feel better, made them smile, laugh, etc? You ever been good at something? Do you love your life, and yourself? Do you love the people around you? Do you show them? I could go on, these things are what's important to me though. 
 
Life only has as much value as we as individuals can put into it. 

Everything is relative, if you're struggling, you're struggling. Just because somebody had it worse and appeared to do "better" does not make our struggles invalid in any way. All we ever have is our own viewpoint. 

This is something I myself struggle with. I can't help but to do it sometimes. How do you not feel worthless when you see somebody else appear to struggle with something much more severe than your situation? I don't know, but I vehemently believe in the words I've stated above. I may not always adhere to my advice but I sure as fuck try 
$C: Not trying to diminish his incredible achievements, but it does help that he was born with an incredibly gifted mind. There's hundreds of thousands of other people with ALS who were not able to succeed in the way he did, Stephen is a rare anomaly.
$C: While the downvotes are certainly warranted, this made me laugh. Very unexpected
$C: This gets me

I never thought of it like that, but you‚Äôre right.  ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è


$C: ERB dude
$C: A very dear friend of mine is currently going through ALS and I would certainly not be able to spend as many happy moments with him as I do if it weren't for the advancements made in the past few years. Hawking's diagnosis is a tragedy but in a way it has created a lot of joy in the world. He will be missed dearly.
$C: Makes you wonder what talent HAS been wasted. 
$C: Yep, this was my point. There is intense competition for postdoc positions, then assistant professor positions, and then you still have to spend years fighting for tenure. 
$C: Your example disproves your point. The leader of the X-Men is not ‚ÄúDr. X‚Äù üòù
$C: [deleted]
$C: It's awesome to read quotes of his, and see how humble and insightful he was. We need more of what he had.
$C: I read that in his voice
$C: Didn't he cheat on his wife with his nurse?
$C: Found the dualist.
$C: Found the person who needs to make this about politics/religion because they're a sniveling bag of human garbage who'd rather argue than grieve the loss of one of humanity's most prolific minds.

$C: It's a famous poem by Robert Frost.

My heart burns there, too. 
$C: Hmmm...Yes. Shallow *and* pedantic. 
$C: I assumed a triumvirate of Hawking, Ozzy, and the queen would eventually rule the world.
$C: If the Queen dies within the next week I'm blaming you
$C: God save the queen!
$C: You shush! 
$C: The Queen is gonna live another 50 years or so.

In my mind, I play it out as her just playing some cruel lifelong joke where Charles just never inherits the crown...ever.
$C: Shut up shut up shut up!
$C: Don't say that!
$C: Long live the queen
$C: Are you Russian, perchance?
$C: That is a pretty solid way to sell some pitchforks.
$C: Nah man, they‚Äôll just reboot her from the most recent save. 
$C: Every time they say "God save the queen" the queen's life span increases by a substantial amount. Us on the other side could try this but it's not like we want Xi Jinping, a man with lifelong power over China to be an immortal.
$C: I wonder if the age of global celebrities is over now that the internet grabs at our attention in so many different ways and TV's glory days are over.
$C: [In case you are wondering.](https://youtu.be/8-u5nd2GqNE)
$C: It's a dark crystal thing. he dies, she fades away.
$C: Nah she's actually immortal
$C: Which Queen?
$C: That's what they said about Newton

$C: Yeah. Ignorant. He was obviously easy e
$C: That made me sad for some weird reason 
$C:  Let's just hope his legacy is never forgotten
$C: His contributions will always be with us. And while I might've personally veered far from astronomy and physics into other sciences, his influence on future generations of researchers will be felt for a long, long time to come.
$C: Besides writing a seminal 'vulgarization' of astrophysics and some anecdotes of time travel parties I have to honestly and shamefully admit that I don't know what the specific contributions of his were that paved new paths. I'd like to see some of those mentioned in these threads but i just see quotes. 
$C: I have it as a litograph, so the book became a t-shirt.
$C: [A quick explanation by Kurzgesagt, for anyone curious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-P5IFTqB98) (begins around 4:25)
$C: [This whole article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_thermodynamics) is fascinating. Not sure how much is directly related to Hawking's work, but I'm sure a lot of it is.
$C: Always playing with the wheat thresher!
$C: Lil Stevie just wouldn't listen :/
$C: Infidelity, being a jerk to his aides, the usual.
$C: Yeah he apparently was pretty full of himself. However, I think it's fine in his case
$C: His disease was als right? Is that like a degenerative muscle disorder? Or is it just neck down paralysis?

Didnt he have that voice module thing? I could have sworn he had sone sort of voice thing, didnt know he had to blink out each letter.
$C: Yeah don't get me wrong.  Nye inspired many people to take up an interest in science and math and he could have been the push the next Hawking-level young scientist needed to start their career.  That sort of impact can't be understated.  But in terms of advancing humanity's knowledge and understanding the truth of our reality, the difference between Hawking and Nye is cavernous. 
$C: I could but that's only because I got a degree in a science related field recently.  

There is a dearth of living household-name scientists who are making (or made)  advancements in their field. Hawking was a huge loss for inspiring young people to take up science or math. 
$C: Time to watch *The Theory of Everything* again.
$C: I‚Äôve always thought about reading one high, that‚Äôd be an adventure. This guys books already blow my mind. 
$C: Dude had sex. He has three kids. AFTER he was disabled.
$C: Yeah this dude knows, that's why every scientific genius is usually in a wheel chair with some sort of paralysis. 
$C: Isn't that the beauty of humanity?

Something can mean something completely different yet so much to different people.

Its awesome
$C: People want others to read what they say so they hijack random comments at the top because they think their message is more important than others. It's an unfortunate result of the way comments are presented here.
$C: Definitely. He had many roadblocks and hurdles just to convey information and ideas. 
$C: The equations are only part of the work. For example, Einstein's equations for relativity are great, but if he just made them adhoc from experimental data it wouldn't be the same as the concept that mass affects the curvature of space-time. Or for the theory of everything, coming up with strings and the fact that there are 10 dimensions (or 26 depending on your version) is maybe the most critical part.

Before relativity, there was this whole ether thing to try to explain the speed of light but it was a shitty explanation. Coming up with something really different is what made him a genius, not finding the equations (that are actually quite simple considering how complex it is).
$C: He'd be proud of spreading knowledge even after his passing. 
$C: Agreed. And it‚Äôs a great book. Dense to a degree but still 
$C: I thought you said ‚Äúcosmetology‚Äù and I was confused for a moment 
$C: Sarcasm or not?
$C: He got lucky in a sense his respiratory muscles and diaphragm weren't that affected along with some of his bulbar symptoms remaining in slow progression for a long time . 

People who die in under 5 or 2 years gave a very rapid progression and go from ambulatory to complete weakness in a year. 

My aunt had ALS and she lived about 10 years from diagonsis. 
$C: Damn. Looks like it‚Äôs time to break some rules. 
$C: Sadly... you're correct :(
$C: There's also a sequel if I recall correctly, read them a few years ago. It was my favourite book for a while.
$C: It was a good joke dude, made me chuckle. Nothing bad in trying to make some people laugh during a tough time. Dont beat yourself up over it and i‚Äôll be sharing that toast to hawking with you and many others tonight.
$C: The way you put it wasn't the calmest but you are right. That was completely inappropriate and he didn't add anything of value to the discussion. It had almost nothing to do with Stephen Hawking.     
Sometimes a random posts popularity will really show the common age of the sites demographic. You will get marked down for them but you aren't wrong and your comments don't have any less value than his did.
$C: Doesn't take much to twist your nips
$C: Almost all religions have a heaven
$C: You don't just listen to them, you elect celebrities as your president. 

$C: Being a critical thinker is unrelated to politics? Perhaps you shouldn't have used a runner or a cook as examples.
$C: [removed]
$C: Man I had to go back and reread **so many** paragraphs and it still had me mouthing ‚Äúwait...what?‚Äù
$C: A pity you never got to correct Stephen Hawking himself. This loss must hit you the hardest of us all.
$C: As a physicist, yeah, he was no Einstein whatsoever, but he was an important figure in science communication as a source of inspiration and interest in science.
$C: It must feel good to insult a dead man.
$C: Does it just not come right in your mind that a very good physicist died on Pi day? I was talking about the odds of this happening. He didn‚Äôt contribute directly to ‚ÄúPi‚Äù at all. 
$C: Ohhhh you're smart too.

$C: There is always someone else to rise to the occasion :) 
$C: not sure about what an uneducated PhD physics professor is... so he's got a PhD, but is uneducated? That is a conflicting statement. But I do have an astrophysics professor who has the same birthday as Galileo and I would be happy to compare him with that dude. Plus, people are not cars. Only simpletons create oversimplified simile to satisfy their ignoramus.
$C: [removed]
$C: >despite GR being one of the most successful scientific models ever created. 

Using your logic, Christianity is one of the most successful religious models, so it should somehow prove god exists. It doesn't. And despite the "success" of gr, black holes have still never been observed, recreated, or tested. Please reconsider your definition of "success."

The forces that mold hurricanes are the same forces that mold galaxies, yet only simple idiots believe there's a black hole at the center of hurricanes. Electricity is present on every scale of observation, from the atom to the cosmic web. If scientists truly endeavor to figure out the nature of our universe, the answer will be...Universal.  
$C: Its k. We cant change the forsaken.
$C: > What exactly is wrong with the current BBT model and what does this "electric" theory fix in what is wrong?

There are two flaws with GR.  The first flawed theory is that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. The second is that Einstein uses the ad hoc explanation of "spacetime" to excuse the first failure to measure communication faster than the speed of light. 

The speed of light is a constant, not a limit as Einstein suggested.  If the light from the sun takes 8 minutes to reach earth, then the gravity that holds earth in the suns orbit must also take 8 minutes to update. [Tom van Flandern](http://www.ldolphin.org/vanFlandern/gravityspeed.html) calculated that the distance from the Earth to the sun would double every 1200 years if our planet were constantly chasing where the sun was 8 minutes ago, instead of its actual location. This isn't the case, so something else is updating the gravitational relationship between the earth and sun real-time. 

Since Einstein couldn't fathom communication faster than the speed of light, he had to manufacture an excuse for the Earth to maintain a consistent orbit around the sun. Enter "spacetime." 

If we dispose of the erroneous theory that the sun is nuclear powered and instead model it as an electrical circuit, then explaining the gravitational balance between stars and their planets becomes much easier. The neutral balance between the electromagnetic fields of planets and the sun explain their consistent orbits perfectly. 

Electricity is scalable. You can use the same electrical process to model tornadoes, atoms, hurricanes, solar flares, galaxial rotation, etc. Why on earth would self-consistent electrical explanations exist for every concept known to science, EXCEPT black holes and spacetime? 
$C: > when you are clearly incredibly ignorant on the subject?

The subject of black holes? How can anyone speak intelligently on black holes if they've never even been observed?

 You've talked yourself into a circle. I daresay you're unqualified to lecture anyone on ignorance. 
$C: Show me a picture of one (1) to study.
$C: English please.
$C: And not everyone who is a dick is smart.
$C: Nobody was criticizing him, just bullshitting about him not being smart and not doing anything, both of which are false.

Criticize if you want, but at least be factual about it.
$C: I looked at how you type and realized you‚Äôre essentially the polar opposite of Hawking. Downvote and shit on him for being such a disrespecting cunt, ‚Äòfellow redditors‚Äô
$C: Wow. The memes on r/mde are true.
$C: What a sad way to think. The fact that this post is making front page makes me very happy though. All should respect and love science. Youre in the minority. This is the end of the life of a great man.
$C: You dont have to.

But its sad you go to places you dont give a shit about to say negative shit just to be a dick. It speaks volumes on the type of person you are and its the type of person who will only be loved by a handful of people. You'll die more alone than even the most average person and you may say "I dont care" but deep down, you truly do. You'll die in fear or.ignorance. Maybe both.

Or maybe you're too stupid to understand any of that. In that case, all you need to know is Stephen Hawking is and always has made a more postive impact on total strangers than you will to even the cloest people to you. To even your own children. You're the type of person that younger ones will learn from you not from the hard working, respectful, honest, or postive person you were, but from the mistakes you made and the hate and ignorance in your heart. They will learn by doing the OPPOSITE of everything you stand for and everything you ever will be.
$C: You're Beibo?
$C: If only it were funny as well
$C: [deleted]
$C: Clearly you have not thoroughly read his studies and/or followed his life. He was back and forth on the God question to say the least. 
$C: Exactly. Science will never disprove religion and religion will never disprove science. Religion is way better when you believe science by the way ;)

$C: Funny a bunch of other institutions had articles out, BBC, Reuters...Not even a breaking news banner for it, but they did have one for the special election. 

You understand CNN has people on the clock 24/7 right? You understand for people like Stephen Hawking they have stories with his biography written up. Only thing to add in is that he died, where, and his age. Of course you knew this already, what am I saying. 

 

$C: eh i said i'm treating "part" of modern science as a religion, i think many branches of science have problems but i mainly hate theoretical physicists, you know, i'm mostly railing against certain branches of physics, i think most scientists get too little attention while some people like Hawking get too much 
$C: Doctor Who frequently ran into past versions of himself and even worked together with them on multiple occasions.

Using Doctor Who as a basis of rules for Time Travel is isn't wise since the entirety of the show is about breaking the own rules they've set.

$C: Yeah, like the plot for "Father's Day"
$C: This might be the greatest thing I‚Äôve ever read

$C: "I showed those mother fuckers" 
$C: That seems like a fairly odd prognosis!
$C: Now that's an odd / oddly-specific prognosis!
$C: Sorry for your loss.

And, yeah, I know about the things you mentioned. My mother's progression is the classical feet/legs first, then arms, core body strength (she cant really move anymore). Her breathing muscles are getting weaker. She does have trouble coughing, etc. Or when choking on sth, even mucus. You probably know. Speaking is still fine though.

We got lucky in terms of progression speed, she is on the somewhat slower end. I've had quite a bit of time to come to terms with the relentlessness of the disease. It is rather nasty in that it never stops or halts, you can always "look forward" to you losing ever more motor control. No hope for remission. The time we had was a blessing though. I've had time to accept what one has to. I suspect the end might not be too pleasant (as my mother rejects all invasive therapy, which includes feeding tubes and assisted breathing/ventilation). She is in contact with the Swiss Dignitas organisation - assisted suicide - which she is considering. Tough decisions, but I have accepted that it is fully her decision to make and I will support her (and my father, as the primary caregiver, which is also a tough burden).

Thank you for your wellwishes, I appreciate it a lot.
$C: I am sorry for your loss. ALS seems like such a horrible way to end a life. I hope your passing will be gentle, of old age and in your sleep.
$C: My best friends sister was diagnosed with ALS in 2003. I dont know if she has a mild form of it or what, but she has lived a healthy life, and she started declining in health only like 2 years ago. She can still walk but with a cane now, which she only started using last year. She even had 2 kids. I guess some people are lucky.
$C: > My grandfather was diagnosed with als in either ‚Äò98 or ‚Äò99 and he‚Äôs still alive! In fact, he‚Äôs still speaking! It progresses differently in everyone that has it. Not an easy thing to watch though. 

That is impressively slow progression. Good for him.

And yeah, I can confirm the last two points. It does progress quite differently for each person and yeah it is not an easy thing to watch or be affected by.
$C: > Is there any pathology on how one gets ALS? Is it a genetic disease? Is it something one acquires? I'm honestly curious. How does somebody acquire ALS?

For 10% of cases, we know the condition is heritable and can run in families. We've found a number of defective genes that account for most of these cases by now (not just one, but multiple genes that can all - if defective - cause the same problem, degeneration of the motor neurons).

For the other 90%... we just don't know. So far, we haven't found out what causes the disease to trigger/start in those cases.
 
Environmental factors are being considered. There is statistical correlation for a number of them. Exposure to pesticides. Smoking. Rather strong evidence that there is a connection to traumatic head injuries. White collar workers (for totally unknown reasons) seem to have a higher incidence.

Overall, for the non-genetic 90% ... we really don't know what the causal links are.

ALS seems to belong to a broad category of degenerative diseases where protein degradation plays a major role (like Parkinson‚Äôs disease and even Alzheimer‚Äôs), but they all have so far resisted detailed causal study. We know roughly what is going wrong at the end of it, but why it starts going wrong is poorly understood and it is rather doubtful that all cases are single-cause. It may well be multiple factors that can interact in a complex fashion, or maybe reach a certain problematic treshhold. We really don't understand it very well (again, except for a few clearcut cases where defective genes are responsible).
$C: Feeding tubes or liquids of various consistencies. (Thin liquids, nectar thick liquids , ect.)

When using liquids, they will often feel the throat while someone is swallowing to ensure it went down the correct tube.

$C: psssh cows die everyday, Einstein was only born once.
$C: Same here. All vehicles are stating March 14th.
$C: When someone like that is alive you never know if or when they may make another big breakthrough in some scientific field (like Hawking radiation). When they're dead though, that's it. You'll never hear of any new discoveries from them again.
$C: So would Galileo because of the whole not speaking English thing
$C: Ahh that's essentially what I thought. I'm of course not trying to diminish his accomplishments but it seems there were a lot of amazing physicists in the past century. 
$C: Most people are like that. 
$C: If I invented calculus I'd probably think I could never be wrong, too.
$C: Pythagoras too
$C: I would think before the introduction of global connections where I could actually meet all the smartest people in the world, combined with me inventing calculus and moving physics forward by centuries, I'd probably think I was hot shit too.
$C: > the historic Isaac Newton

I prefer the modern Isaac Newton. His robotic exoskeleton is the bee's knees.
$C: That's why I like Leibniz more.
$C: The apple fell far from the tree
$C: There's a general problem where funding doesn't exist for wrongness. Funding generally goes towards research that can be used politically or for profit. Research that tests an unlikely hypothesis or tries to reaffirm a hypothesis tested elsewhere isn't as sexy as funding "the right answer to life, the universe, and everything."

A lot of the problems in academia stem from an environment that forces a "publish or perish" lifestyle on PhDs.
$C: Science is a liar sometimes! 

I always loved that line (from Always Sunny, for that single person on reddit that hasn't seen it) for the opposite reason of what Mac tries to convey. Yes science is wrong many, many times, but that is how we learn and how we will keep on learning.

I'm sure that in due time some really smart person will come and make Hawkins and everyone else on Earth look like a bitch. 
$C: I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs really a majority. There are certainly many examples of what you describe. But I‚Äôd say a majority of scientists are intellectually honest. 

Nonetheless, Hawking was a prominent example for good. 
$C: I never got the aversion to being wrong. If I was never wrong how could I ever be sure I was right? Being wrong is just a chance to learn more about something. There is no crime in ignorance, only in willful ignorance, being presented with hard fact and choosing to ignore it. 

No one should be faulted for asking a question, or talked down to because they don't know something. Would people rather them continue to be ignorant or ask and learn more than they knew before? 

Shit I take for granted, like knowing how stars work or obscure knowledge about muon-catalyzed nuclear fusion, alternative methods of spacecraft propulsion, how a battery works, how to change the boot order in BIOS, hell how to operate a modern 'smart TV'...it'd be super pompous of me to assume everyone knows that stuff. And equally so for me to assume I know everything ever and am never wrong and never have to go back and fact check myself or go back and start over with a new hypothesis or revise what I said based on new information that I got by asking questions. 

May the old genius have a peaceful rest, if no time travelers show up at his funeral we must never invent time travel. Probably. Most likely. More research is needed. (Not really... I mean like 99% never but maybe? Can we ever really be totally sure? Maybe it's got some weird limit to how far back you can go and you're stuck with only being able to go back 10 years. So if some time in the future time travel is invented with those limitations, if it's after a persons lifetime by more than 10 years no one could come back to oh no I've gone cross eyed...) 
$C: Even Stephen Hawking* got more pussy than you


$C: He wasn't always in a wheelchair.
$C: Right. I'm more focused on honoring the guy but this really intrigues me.
$C: There‚Äôs a movie made about him. You‚Äôll get all the answers.
$C: I made a point to go see it when it was in the theater and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm not familiar enough with his life to know how much it departed from reality but it didn't come across as trying to sugar coat things.

That was also my introduction to Felicity Jones. Hot damn üî•
$C: Well his wife also kind of cheated on him
$C: Not sure why, but I read this in the voice of Stephen Colbert. 
$C: He cheated on her while traveling for conferences with his personal nurse, IIRC. Turns out, ALS doesn't always take erections away from you, which is pretty obvious when you remember that thing works with the circulatory system, not the muscles

Edit: I'm being told ALS can take erections away, but didn't in his case

Edit #2: For anyone who reads this and struggles with this illness, I think this might be important to read http://alsworldwide.org/whats-new/article/sexual-intimacy

(how much longer is needed before "wow, this comment blew up overnight!" and "thanks for the gold, kind stranger!"?) 
$C: wheel chair =/= broke dick
$C: I can't imagine any other way than the nurse being infatuated with his hot ass knowledge and furiously sat on his main center of knowldge.
$C: He wasn't always in a wheelchair.
$C: no, cheating is one of the lowest things a human can do imo
$C: Thank you. That said, I'm doing good. As awful as that statement seems it's just...well, "normal" to me. So I don't worry
$C: About 10 minutes

$C: Michio kaku - as far as mainstream scientists who did more than just educate the public. 
$C: NDT is to full of himself. He always has to prove hes smarter and rub it in everyones face hes so damn smug nothing from him is allowed on /r/iamverysmart because its just too easy, everything he says reeks of that smug assholish intelligence.

Hawkings didnt need to prove anything, he knew he was smarter than us all and didnt need to rub it in anyones face.
$C: No disrespect to Elon Musk, but he's an engineer, not a scientist.
$C: In the Bible, Jesus tells a parable about a guy who goes to hell and then begs for someone to warn his family so they repent of their sins and don't also go to hell.

Christianity itself is the thing you have a problem with.
$C: John 3:16
$C: Doesn't look like it, but he *is* a /r/t_d user so this is pretty much to be expected.
$C: It's called playing the hand you're dealt. I seriously don't know how to express how impressed I am with him.
$C: I smell a CBS sitcom.
$C: People simply don‚Äôt want to hear bad news and love to defy authority. Medicine isn‚Äôt as simple as people think. People‚Äôs prognosis change on a day to day basis. Personally I try to never prognosticate unless it‚Äôs a terminal cancer patient and even then I give a huge disclaimer.
$C: You think he'd tell us if he did? Dude had a *fantastic* poker face. Even if he was freaking out, he'd play it cool, like 'You've totally got this, Hawking.'
$C: Like that thing that happens next year, that we're not supposed to talk about üòâ
$C: I don't believe they could. The voice he used was unique, mostly because every other computer using that voice was beyond obsolete, and he was aware how much of his identity came from that voice that he was pretty adamant on keeping it. Im sure I saw something about him getting the copyright to it so he could protect his identity more.
$C: Yes, however someone who isn't famous might want to update it for a more natural/personal voice for day to day reasons. Not everyone wants to sound like a robot, but you're right in the fact that it became the voice that everyone associated him with. Just thought it was a cool point that one of his main reasons for keeping it was for kids with conditions that force them to use a machine to speak, making the robot voice kinda cool.
$C: I‚Äôd like a better voice, tbh.
$C: Or John Oliver asking if there was a parallel universe out of infinite universes where he was smarter than Hawking, and Hawking replied "No. But there is a universe where you're actually funny."
$C: [deleted]
$C: I'm sure even non-science people would geek out over Stephen Hawking
$C: Susan Boyle?
$C: Probably a bad day to point this out, but his contributions to physics wouldn't rank anywhere near the top 100 for the 20th century. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: If anything Tyson is the new Sagan and that in it self is an accomplishment.

But I can't really say how Tyson has really progressed Sagan work rather than reiterated it.
$C: I'd put his intellect on level with Einstein, Wheeler, Feynman, Schroedinger, but even Hawking would constantly say that his insights wouldn't have been possible without those who came before.  He even made an entire book about it, "On the Shoulders of Giants".  

Of those who might be considered greater intellects, of the 20th century I can only think of Ramanujan and von Neumann.  They all pale in comparison to Isaac Newton, however.  Humanity may never see another like him, considering the dearth of knowledge that existed in the world when he arrived and essentially created modern physics and mathematics from pure intellect and reason.
$C: I personally think Joyce is the reincarnation of Shakespeare with a bit more trolling. And that's fully recognizing how much of a troll Shakespeare was.
$C: I just consider Hawking smarter because he succeeded where Einstein failed and did it without being able use his hands to write stuff down. It's all subjective of course. 
$C: Strawman much? I said average compared to other top-physicists at the time. The documentary I watched on him made the claim he wasn't smarter than all the other physicists he worked with, he just worked at his problems harder and thought outside the box.

But I guess I shouldn't expect people to get beyond "muh einstein" here. Sorry for trying to change your perception just a bit.
$C: I specifically remember hearing this in a documentary on Einstein. I knew I'd get downvoted because people love their Einstein but whatever, to me it makes him even greater because it shows you don't need intellect to be imaginative and open-minded.
$C: TIL Stephen Hawking was British. I guess I just never looked into it and also never heard an accent for obvious reasons. That‚Äôs cool
$C: This makes sense now, as a Brit, I heard of this new ALS disease and wondered why no one seemed to have it in the uk. 
$C: Indeed. In England they actually call it ‚ÄúDouglas Jardine disease‚Äù because of the way it attacks your body and will leave you in a wheelchair pretty quick if you aren‚Äôt careful. 
$C: It's not the same thing - ALS is a Motor Neuron Disease.

MND is preferred in the UK, unless you're being very specific.
$C: Thank you sir/ma‚Äôam, it‚Äôs about as rough as it gets when it comes to disease. I don‚Äôt wish it on anyone and pray for a cure as well. 
$C: NHS FTW. Seriously.
$C: How could he be from the UK if he didn‚Äôt have a british accent /s
$C: Very informative, that helps. Thanks. 
$C: "Mild" isn't the correct word, but it was still had remarkably slow progression for that class of diseases. 
$C: That article answered all my questions, thanks! 
$C: There are a LOT of things we don't understand well. Viruses for instance.
$C: He changed our view of the world, we didn't deserve him.
$C: The term "meant to be" is something every scientist would not agree with, unless reconstructing bone sections. 
$C: No doubt about it. Prof. Hawking would scoff at me for saying this lol
$C: Username checks out. 
$C: Then why are we?
$C: We are all happy little accidents.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Damn wonder why the universe gave up on him. Did the universe want him to prove a theory and he refused to?
$C: They hatin'
$C: Rollin' rollin' rollin'
$C: FWIW A man in his 90s I met recently told me he had a good [western] friend who had been kept in solitary in a Chinese prison for ten years. He said the man was highly educated/brilliant and kept sane by retelling himself books he'd read. That's all I got.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Nevertheless, it's about average.

$C: Actually it's u/I_SOMETIMES_EAT_HAM

congrats :)
$C: Sure, but it's not like we have hundreds of really renowned scientists that pretty much everyone knows.  So it's a neat coincidence that his birth and death were related to two of the most well known scientists. If he died yesterday or tomorrow then he wouldn't be linked with a well-known scientist as far as I can tell.
$C: Yeah he sounds kinda robotic tbh 
$C: Yeah, but then we would have no pi day at all, so close enough 
$C: Whattaya tryna do, take Pi Day away? We could all change to YY/MM/DD, that would make sense and still keep Pi Day

$C: I've heard about Ozzy being studied before but is there any source on this? How did they study him? Did they physically get him into a lab or did they get some of his DNA and just study that?
$C: [Ozzy's actually looking pretty good going by n interview a year ago.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IM5b6rvfpU)

Only 69 too, I reckon he'll stick around for a while longer.
$C: Like a cockroach. 
$C: **tl;dr: 'Ozzy Osbourne is an X-man.' Gotcha.
$C: I've seen the term "cocaine elemental" used to describe him.
$C: Tell that to his concept of the english language. Cause that's been dead for years.
$C: No, blood of the young, there's a word for it which I don't remember.
$C: One cell at a time...
$C: And on top of that he lived a regular life span
$C: Instructions unclear, buying crystal meth.
$C: And accomplished so much 
$C: Average lifespan for a healthy person.  Average lifespan after an ALS diagnosis is less then 10 years
$C: Out of all the people that could have beaten the odds and lived so long with ALS, I'm glad it was him. He contributed so much knowledge to the human race, it's amazing. Sad he had to go, but also so glad he was even able to accomplish what he did. His name will be in the history books forever.
$C: That's because we don't really understand ALS. What we call ALS is really 20 different diseases.
$C: Truly he did! Last year, I lost my grandmother to an als diagnosis. She had only been diagnosed 6 months prior to her passing. It can be a swift disease, but she did the best with what time she had.
$C: He really didn't look 76.

To some degree, suffering is relative. What determines the level of suffering is not the actual stimuli causing it, but the strength of the reaction in the brain. This means that even people living pampered lives can suffer quite a bit, while those living in Nigeria with electricity problems and no access to clean water or indoor plumbing can manage to find happiness because they are used to their struggles.

In other words, I strongly agree with your viewpoint. 

An interesting concept that may or may not follow from this idea: arguably the most important suffering in our society is that of the most powerful, wealthy people -- because even if they lead the "easiest" lives, even relatively minor suffering in them can be amplified to have huge effects on others.
$C: It‚Äôs totally justified.
$C: Considering what goes on in the world and has gone on for all time would you be so naive as to believe God is a good one? There may be a higher power of some sort but there is no way it cares about us enough to even give us an afterlife of any sort.
$C: If there is a hell, that makes the devil a subcontractor of God. So why would the bible spend most of its time prophesying the devil‚Äôs destruction if he‚Äôs just doing his job?
$C: Only if it's an afterlife as conceived by religion. 
$C: it's pretty messed up to send one of your creations to eternal suffering, sounds unethical. Why would I want to believe in an afterlife where hell is an option?
$C: The millions of Darwin winners, the millions killed, the millions unknown to the rulers of humanity... the potential of the species is... insane to think about- let alone the amount of loss in the timeline of our modern lineage. 
$C: That‚Äôs interesting. Was it *because* its a more prestigious title than Dr?

$C: Ozzy walked through the hotel lobby I work at the other day. I was surprised he wasn‚Äôt surrounded by flames and issuing music from his pores. Pretty mundane. It‚Äôs weird that even idols are really just people.
$C: God damn you- you just damned Ozzy and the Queen. This year is going to hurt.
$C: Some day everyone will die. Then it'll just be Keith Richards and a couple of roaches.
$C: Who are you kidding, Ozzy can't die. Death isn't a hard enough drug
$C: After Lemmy Kilmeister died...all bets are off. If Lemmy could die ANYONE could die. 
$C: Keith Richards instead of Ozzy, though.
$C: Don‚Äôt forget Betty White.
$C: don't forget Keith Richards. 
$C: With Stan Lee as a fourth in command.
$C: Don't forget mick jagger and Keith Richards

$C: Imagine being Abe Vigoda and having people surprised when you finally DID die.  

$C: You forgot Keith Richards.
$C: something something remind me 1 week

^(In seriousness, close, but no.)
$C: Yep that's the last panel of the strip.
$C: NASA is currently spending billions on the SLS, which will be obsolete by the time it's completed due to the efforts of SpaceX. NASA is aware of this, and still spending billions more continuing the project because no one wants to say that they have spent billions on a project only to scrap it, so they are going to spend billions  more to finish an obsolete program. They are not underfunded, they are using their funding for shit that we will never use. 


$C: > now if only we could properly fund NASA again.

It's a government organisation, that will never happen, that distinct difference is also why Space X operates for far cheaper than NASA.
$C: Where can I find more information on space travel's effect on the human body?
$C: How is that going to grant Snoop with immortality?
$C: >Its a reference to a rap battle 

An *epic* rap battle..
$C: You're in a news thread posting references to rap battles. Grow up. Stay on topic. 
$C: That voice isn't available anymore, it was only kept alive because Hawking said he identified with it.

So in a way, it dies with him...
$C: His predictions about the awakening of AI turn out half right, they do become self aware, but what he didn‚Äôt expect is that they have the souls of poets.
$C: it never will be.
$C: I hope he kept prolific notes on all of his ideas. We won't forget him any time soon, but I hope even the barest inkling or smallest idea he has was documented so we can explore it.
$C: Better yet, let's not allow his legacy to be forgotten.
$C: He has given so much, we can hope it wont
$C: Who‚Äôs legacy?
$C: wait, black holes can be small enough they have only the mass of an asteroid? that's more surprising me than anything!
$C: *looks at Stephen Hawking*

Infidelity you say?

Now that just puts how ugly my ass is into perspective.
$C: So that proves he was human, who gives a shit. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: > Is that like a degenerative muscle disorder?

yup, including the muscles in his neck that he needed for speech.

>Didnt he have that voice module thing?

yes, but that technology didn't exist his entire career. its only very recently that the technology has progressed to the level that you can make an argument that its good/fast as doing it unassisted.

$C: It's a degenerative nerve disorder, if I understand it correctly.  The muscles would still work if only the brain could talk to them. :/

EDIT:  Thankfully, he has had a speech-generating computer in recent years, but did those even exist before... ~~I dunno... the late 90s? Early 2000s?~~ 1980-something.  The look-and-blink method seems excruciatingly slow, but evidently it was enough to do amazing work.

EDIT 2: [Did the research](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wired.com/2015/01/intel-gave-stephen-hawking-voice/amp) on the date, sorta. Apparently he got his first synthesized voice around 1985, using a system based on an Apple II computer.
$C: Never seen it. I know what I'm doing tonight
$C: Kids don't imply sex. Kids imply kids. Try again.
$C: Fuck thats deep.
$C: Fair point. Didn't mean to intentionally oversimplify.
$C: Either way it's all about the make up.
$C: No, not at all. It's got full page pictures, it's clearly aimed at the layperson.
$C: Same with Rosalind Franklin. People say Watson and Crick screwed Rosalind Franklin out of a Nobel Prize, but it was because she had died four years prior.
$C: I looked it up after writing my previous comment, and apparently there are four sequels now, the last of which came out in 2016! Makes me want to read them.
$C: All religions have an afterlife.

Only Abrahamic faiths (and also Zoroastrianism, in fact some say Judaism got the concept of Heaven from the Iranians) have a "Heaven" and "Hell"

But it does seem like a curious error in an amusing anecdote.

Do you feel better landing that zinger on a stranger?  Have you righted a wrong?

$C: Not all Phds are created equal buddy, sorry to break it to you. You probably went to some garbage school. Look up John Von Neumann, thats a real genius. Not Hawking, who is a celebrity genius. 
$C: There are legit sites where people sell reddit accounts.
$C: You have got to be a troll. I didn‚Äôt say GR is true because it‚Äôs popular, it‚Äôs true because there has never been a single reliable, reproducible, reputable experiment that has disproved it. You seriously, genuinely have no understanding of the field, I have no idea where you‚Äôre getting all this shit from. Stop spreading lies 
$C: I didn't think people this deluded actually existed lmao
$C: Their effects have been observed handyman.

$C: You know, it's just bait that you're responding to
$C: Right, and the whole point of my original comment was that it wasn't funny.
$C: Bull, I‚Äôve read everything from the grand design to the universe in a nutshell.  Hawkings wasn‚Äôt agnostic (if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre saying) many people twisted his quotes and he finally gave them their answer

I'll eagerly await whatever mental gynmastics laden explanation you've got for how the username "TriggeredNiggard" is actually completely innocent.
$C: The copy and paste is strong with this one.
$C: Lol wut. Yes we do... Stars are generally formed from a large collection of molecular clouds collapsing into one. They die due to the nature process of fusion, and black holes specifically come from the collapse of certain classes of stars due to their size.

$C: With your belly full of wine and a mouth around your cock.
$C: Thank you for the answer! I really appreciate it!
$C: As science would have it, yes, it does. 
$C: Nah, first colonized museum  
$C: Am Norwegian, didn't learn until the Eddie Redmayne movie. Not that I'd given it much thought before.
$C: Yes, I am. Never gave his nationality much thought-- I heard an American accent, and assumed he was one. Fairly reasonable, I think.
$C: What does that have to do with anything
$C: And fun that'll never end it's adventure TIME!!!
$C: Get back in there then!
$C: Happy birthday!
$C: I'm the sacrifice.

$C: Completely understand that aspect, which is why his death is sad to me despite me having no relationship with him, but I have no stories to tell of what it was like to be alive at the same time as him.
$C: Reminds me of my father :/ 
$C: Understandable though. When you have to deal with enough nasty hyenas out there ready to bite you the moment you show "weakness" of admitting your wrongs, you start to become nasty yourself, and you find out that you've become one of the hyenas. It takes a conscious effort to break out of this shitty cycle.
$C: Yeah, but it's a really shitty attribute for a scientist... I can't for the life of me understand the mind set of a scientist who, looking for the scientific *truth*, won't tolerate scepticism. That's basically the entire foundation which science is built upon!
$C: At 25 years old. 
$C: Leibniz did. (Pun intended)
$C: Pythagoras is God. He could speak to animals and had a golden thigh.
$C: Also his notation is just way more intuitive 
$C: I like his [chocolate biscuits](https://i.imgur.com/p3afcH2.png).
$C: That is the larger issue, yes. Well said. Can't upvote this enough. 
$C: Stupid science couldn't even make my friend more smarter
$C: It's a difficult metric to measure but you're likely right in that correction. It's one of those things where the loudest voices, biggest egos in the room - even if a minority - draw the illusion of unanimity. 
$C: Dang and just a minute ago I was telling myself one of the things that must have made him a genius is not having to focus on girls so much
$C: Hate to be "that guy", but Hawking, not Hawkings
$C: He would of laughed at that line.
$C: He was in a wheelchair for a very long time. I think at the time where he cheated with his nurse, he was sitting in a wheelchair for at least 20 years.
$C: Even so
$C: From all accounts, she restrained herself from getting physical with the guy she was interested in.  Even after Hawking told her it was cool as long as she kept loving him, she abstained to not hurt their family.
$C: It can take away erections btw. His just didn't.
$C: So with what he had, was he still able to...um...*finish the job?*  Since that kinda relies on muscle spasms, how does that work?
$C: This opens more questions than it answers. 
$C: Dunno about gold. All you're getting out of me is reddit silver and a second hand wheelchair.
$C: can you blame the guy. he got the shit end of the stick, trapped in his own body. let him have blowjobs from his hot young nurse. i imagine she was hot and young and gave him blowjobs 
$C: Shut up about that. I mean, idk what to say, but can we just let that go? Come on guys. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: IIRC he cheated on her when he was already bounded to a wheelchair 
$C: Cheating is very bad and causes a lot of pain, but you are literally fucking insane if you think it's one of the lowest things a human can do.
$C: Lol what? There are a million things worse than cheating.
$C: I've been told of the physicist lies.
$C: Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"?
$C: Sad death of a famous scientist and a damn good man, and you think "yeah, now's the time for fucking garbage reddit memes. le star wars man"

Fuck you and every reply you're gonna get as your upvotes soar to the top because this website is filled with people like you.
$C: Aqu√≠ estoy.
$C: He's a rocket scientist, engineer and programmer
$C: In that same parable, Jesus goes on to tell that the man's family will not be warned. Hardly a merciful story.

Also, that has absolutely nothing to do with what I said. You are taking your god's exclusive power of judgement and attempting to condemn others to hell in his name.
$C: Sad that those who don't want to be judged also judge others and then justify it. Double standard but you'll never admit it because you hate the truth :(
$C: Well I am not putting anyone down with ALS but he did do something great because of it. I am really impressed.
$C: I think it‚Äôs on Fox or the Cw
$C: Thought it was a little off that you‚Äôd use such a silly sounding made up word given the subject at hand. TIL prognosticate is a real word.
$C: He MADE that voice one of the coolest and most iconic things of all time. Like, It's not just the robot voice, it's the Stephen Hawking robot voice.
$C: To say the least...
$C: Susan Boil isn't a real person :P
$C: Actual question, trying to not phrase it to sound rude: what was it that made him extraordinarily famous, then? Just his disability?
$C: There's not really a good way to ask this without it sounding rude... so sorry in advance. But why do you think that you are in a position to decide how similar he is to Einstein? Do you know anything about their work beyond the smoothed over versions you find in pop science videos? Can you actually name anything Hawking did scientifically other than just saying the phrase "Hawking Radiation"? 
$C: Yeah, Sagan is more accurate for him. I don't know that he's done anything Sagan like aside from reiteration, but reiteration is important to do with access to modern media and connectivity, which I think is important in its own right.
$C: His intellect was most certainly not on the level of Einstein. Einstein didn‚Äôt bullshit about AI and alien encounters and knew how to speak within his range of knowledge usually. He was also generally far more broadly learnt. He was reading Kant‚Äôs CoPR as a teenager and attribute Mach‚Äôs philosophical work to helping him discover relativity if I recall correctly. Einstein was just as good or even better at physics, and managed a broader range of learning than Hawking. And if we are going on ‚Äúpure intellect and reason‚Äù I would argue that Russell and Whitehead, and also Godel are far more superior w/r/t that than those you mentioned in your post‚Äîincluding Newton. 
$C: Ironically, Joyce had a ‚ÄúGaelic hatred‚Äù of Shakespeare. Iirc, he really disliked that he liked Shakespeare as much as he did. He liked Ben Jonson waaaay more. His fucking notebooks from Paris are basically just quotes he liked from Jonson‚Äôs work (that‚Äôs hyperbole, but there are A LOT). 
$C: That's just absurd.

Einstein is one of the most important minds in human history. His name belongs alongside Newton and Galileo. Men whose theories fundamentally altered or defined our understanding of reality itself.

Hawking is inarguably one of the great physicists of his era. But his discoveries have nowhere near the scope of relativity.
$C: Yeah. I think both Hawking and Einstein were similarly intelligent to a point where it's difficult to objectively compare them two.

Einstein had the ability to see things in a completely different and groundbreaking way whereas Hawking perhaps had a better ability to critique and improve on current scientific theory (ie: where Einstein failed). But what is even more remarkable is that he had the ability to express his ideas and make a big impact despite his huge handicap.
$C: It's not at all subjective, if you'd take 10 minutes to even skim the scope of Einstein's work. All you've made clear is you know nothing about Einstein.
$C: It's objectively not true. You're either misremembering, or watched a very spurious doc. 

Einstein had notable physical differences in his brain from a "normal" intellect human. He was definitely an IQ outlier.
$C: It came up when someone on FOX (I think Anne Coulture) said that he'd be fucked under the NHS's 'death panels', not realising that he's been a lifelong advocate of the NHS - and his death will likely put an end to the legal campaign against the Americanisation/Privatisation of the NHS that the tories have been attempting; that he's been organiser of the last few years.
$C: They'll probably start calling it Stephen Hawking Syndrome. 
$C: Born in the UK, to British parents, lived in the uk his entire life. Just had an American accent for his text to speech converter when he lost his voice due to his disability. 
$C: Hero we needed. 
$C: Somehow..there's still idiots who thought the earth is flat..we truly didnt deserve him
$C: What are you talking about? There's a huge amount of religious and/or spiritual scientists. Being a scientist doesn't automatically mean you don't have religious beliefs.
$C: Because we can be.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Because through a series of improbable events dating back billions of years, combined with much we don't understand about time and the universe, somehow we got humans.
$C: The problem with this is that there's nothing "deciding" what should or shouldn't be here. Nothing defines what should or shouldn't exist. They exist, not for any specific reason or purpose, but as a coincidence. 

We exist, and we decide our own purpose. We are not "given" a purpose by the universe, because the universe does not pick and choose. It doesn't think at all.
$C: >this dipshit's pseudo intellectual bullshit.

Huh.

"Meant to be" as a prerequisite for being.

Your claim:  
If people weren't meant to be here, we wouldn't be here. We're here, so we know we're meant to be here.

Logically identical claims:  
If that rock weren't meant to be there, it wouldn't be there. It's there, so we know it's meant to be there.

If AIDS weren't meant to be here, it wouldn't be here. People have AIDS, so we know it's meant to be here.

"Meant to be" by whom and for what? I can only imagine a god with intent and the ability of creation being a logically sound answer, but that presumption would come out of personal unprovable beliefs having nothing to do with the original question.

Now, saying "we're not meant to be here" (meaning that intent may have nothing to do with it) is different from "we're meant to not be here," which takes intent just like the above, and if some being with that power had the desire to explicitly not have us, then sure, but again this is an assumption we have no reason to make at the moment.
$C: [deleted]
$C: It really helps ur case when u add the ‚Äúdownvote me‚Äù argument
$C: So because we exist, it means we were meant to be? That is the stupidest statement I have read on reddit in a while. Especially you calling my comment pseudointellectual bullshit. Why‚Äôd you edit that out, because you realized your new age view on things is stupid?

If there is no god, who decides we are meant to exist? In the universe things happen often without a deeper meaning. The universe isn‚Äôt proven to be concious like we are, so it doesn‚Äôt mean for anything to happen. If a tree branch drops on your car mid drive, it doesn‚Äôt mean it was destined to happen, it means you were in the right place at the right time for it to happen. Believing everything happens for a reason is a stupid and dangerous way to look at life. Oh, that genocide happened, surely it was meant to be! So if a lunatic commits murder, he was conciously set in motion by the universe?
$C: He wanted to prove a theory the universe didn‚Äôt want him to
$C: He‚Äôs just too white and nerdy   

Side note: This prompted me to listen to that song and one of the lines is ‚ÄúStephen Hawking‚Äôs in my library‚Äù. 
$C: Who says we can't do both?
$C: Have you ever heard of Hilary Putnam or Bill Pickering?
$C: Was gonna say 31st of April, then realised.
$C: Will she send herself a letter when she turns 100? 
$C: Right, and no more than that, because when you're a British subject and you turn 100 you get a letter from the Queen. So if she lives to 100 we risk destroying the universe ^(somehow).
$C: Based on her mom, yes. 
$C: Oh I'm sure of it. 
$C: She's holding on for that letter from the Queen...
$C: Will she send a letter to herself on her 100th birthday?
$C: Although you are probably right, just the thought of the queen passing away in my lifetime seems crazy. It will be one of the biggest events of whatever year it happens in.
$C: When she turns 100 she's gonna have to send one of those "Happy 100th birthday from the Queen" cards to herself.
$C: She has to send a letter to herself when she turns one hundred incase if you didn't know. 
$C: Her mother lived to 101
$C: I‚Äôm liz ten, I‚Äôm the bloody queen mate. 

Basically, I rule.

$C: They sequenced his DNA. He's got a lot of gene variants that diminish the negative effects of a lot of drugs. Funnily enough, I guess caffeine wrecks him.
$C: Trail of cocaine into a lab.
$C: He gets transfusions from Keith Richards
$C: Found [this](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/genetic-mutations-ozzy-osbourne-party-hard/story?id=12032552) which has some answers


$C: There's a TED talk involving him as part of the research, could look that up.
$C: I believe they call it an Ozzy Oz Roach. 
$C: Just make sure you realign that shit.
$C: He has accomplished so much with a single pinky than I have in my entire life. 
$C: TBH, I always secretly expected him to upgrade his chair and become a cyborg. I know he's a physicist and not an engineer, but... It just felt inevitable.
$C: You've accomplished a lot too, Admiral Cumfart
$C: I wonder if Mr.Hawking knew if he would touch all of our lives so much and even earn the admiration of Admiral Cumfart 
$C: There is no doubt Hawking will be remembered as one of the titans of science. He will forever be commemorated and honored with the likes of Einstein, Newton, and Galileo. 
$C: It does and I didn't necessarily intend to say you felt worthless. I'm the worthless one here, is what I meant. I don't claim to know anything about you, because I don't. Your comment just seemed as good as any to bounce that idea off of. 

That is quite an interesting afterthought. I had never considered anything of the sort, but it's logical. Kind of a don't bite the hand thing but not really at the same time. 

I enjoy entertaining new ideas. You have taught me something today, and I appreciate that!

> "We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Sahara. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of those stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here. We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds, how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred?"

$C: I'll remember this.
$C: I think Dr. Hawking would have agreed with [the sentiment...](http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/12/31)
$C: Mind a link for the lazy?
$C: It's hard to make a case against the only organizafion in the history of mankind to ever put a man on the moon. We've seen what they can do when they are properly supported. 

No, they're not over funded, they're being sabotaged. Don't be fooled. NASA would be great if we wanted it to be.
$C: Because they are directed to by Congress. I am sure NASA itself would like to put this money to better use, but it‚Äôs a jobs program for Alabama and a few other states largely at the behest of Richard Shelby (R-AL). 
$C: NASA are absolutely underfunded. To keep SLS (or any other NASA project) going involves nixing or pausing other projects. Their funding as a proportion, given how important their work and overarching mission is, is simply pitiful.

Multiple launch systems from multiple vendors are absolutely mandatory for progress and redundancy. The absolute worst thing they could do is scrap or mothball SLS because SpaceX's offerings are 'good  enough'.

That's the precise reason everybody's essentially rebuilding the 60s era heavy lift rockets. That knowledge was astoundingly narrowly spread, so there are large gaps we have to fill in again to build from.

The more widely that is done, the harder it is for that foundation that we should have been building on all this time to be lost again. 
$C: The world will be a much worse place if it is
$C: [Here's a good video by Isaac Arthur explaining these "Kugelblitz black holes"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPgLvRNKpI0), including its relation to Hawking radiation.

[This one by SciShow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNL1RN4eRR8) is less in-depth, but some people can't seem to tolerate Isaac's speech impediment, so here's an alternative video.
$C: Now we can just create tiny black holes to suck away all the trash we have accumulated on the planet!
$C: mm yeah ill take one infidelity with a side of extra jerk to the aides yeah thanks
$C: Well yeah, all our heros turn out to be flawed in one way or another.

$C: Do you have proof that proves he was only a sperm donor and did not have sex? 
$C: No problem, it's hard putting my thoughts into words correctly. I heard a saying that you could see great physics because the equations were really simple yet really powerful.
$C: Oh, really? Had no idea. Thanks, good to know!
$C: Just false man. Ever heard of the Elysian Fields and Hades?

Edit: here for more examples https://listverse.com/2013/10/02/10-heavens-of-world-mythologies/
$C: Ahrighty then *they don't just listen, they elect them
$C: So you're just some dolt who's never been to the country, then? I'd say you're far less qualified to comment on our politics than Mr. Hawking was.
$C: In hindsight that was poorly worded -- I'm not a physicist, but I know that *Hawking* as a physicist did not do anything Einstein-level revolutionary. AFAIK he has made somewhat important contributions in quantum field theory and cosmology. A look at his Wikipedia page shows that he proposed a few different laws for how black holes work but they were ultimately wrong; after that he proposed what he is best known for, Hawking radiation, which basically shows that black holes can die (though it takes an extremely long time). Other research of his hasn't amounted to much (regarding the universe's creation and time) and some of it was wrong (that black holes destroy information).

(Tl;dr As a physicist he was somewhat controversial and was no all-time great by any means, but he is best known for his theorization of the most likely correct Hawking radiation.)

But despite this people know him so well and he is so famous because of him being a communicator of science, like (as another Redditor put it) a sort of mix of Einstein (in that he actually did some important research) and of Carl Sagan.
$C: > John Von Neumann

I agree all education is not made equal, however you seem to look too highly of yourself, a narcissistic cunt who just have to prove a point that they know better about society and throwing a name of old to prove that "You are all mainstream and idiots, while I know better and you probably don't know this guy because he deserves better" bullshit. I've met a lot of people like you, usually the type who don't help make this world progress because you are happily swimming in your own bubble of feaces. A man has just died, yes, a celebrity scientist, but he has done more good than harm in promoting science to a lot of our current generation. Whilst it may upset a certain people like you, to lightly associate Hawking with Einstein, for the sake of saying "oh this is a nice coincidence", someone just have to go and say "you are a bastard for even making that slightest of coupling". Here's my suggestion to you, go spread your hate somewhere else and I also would like to dare you to even achieve half of what a guy who was for most of his life stuck on a chair without much mobility then you can come back to me and say I was wrong - I would gloriously accept defeat. In the meantime go back and suck on your mums tits kid. This will be my last message to you because I don't like indulging with people who have the brains of an ignorant 5 year old. 
$C: >it‚Äôs true because there has never been a single reliable, reproducible, reputable experiment that has disproved it. 

It's true because it's never been disproved? Do you even science? Go sit the fuck down. 
$C: For every Stephen Hawking, we need forsaken individuals.

The scales of life needs balanced, after all.
$C: Fancy CGI you've got there. Find us another video of santa flying around the planet so we can prove he exists too. 


$C: From the wiki page

>A black hole is a region of spacetime... 

Spacetime is a metaphor. It doesn't exist, and therefore can't have "regions" for anything to exist within. If you can't point to it in a lab and do experiments on it, it's just a word soup used to explain fantasies to student-loan cattle. 
$C: I was bored
$C: That still does not refute my point in saying it is an honor, no matter what you believe, to be considered worthy of eternal life by any person. I mean seriously, it‚Äôs a complement for Christ‚Äôs sake. What‚Äôs with the downvotes?! 
$C: No I got downvoted to distract from Trump firing Tillerson.

$C: okay so that only answers one of the many questions
$C: dude was a cosmic macdaddy
$C: His relationship with his wife was really rocky long before then, basically she gave up everything to support him and give birth to his children because she wanted to have babies with a genius and she thought he would die at any moment. But while she was being a housewife everyone and their mother wanted to meet the famous Mr. Hawking. Supposedly the nurse was really mean and manipulative too but not all relationships are meant to be fairy tales.
$C: and even if his dick didn't work there's still a ton of other crap two naked people can do together that I would 100% consider cheating if my SO did it with someone else. 
$C: Thanks for the info, just updated it
$C: I... honestly have no idea how it works, but given that he had kids and had been bounded to a wheelchair since before being a parent, I guess it does work somehow. 
$C: It's a slow drip
$C: He had kids
$C: Frozen said it. Love is an open question
$C: Eh, it's something. Where's that reddit silver bot when you need it? 
$C: I'm not blaming him. As I said somewhere else, he's a person who also made mistakes, like geniuses behind him have done and geniuses to come will. If anything, it just shows that even the best of us humans also commit mistakes and no one is truly perfect.

It just makes no sense to hide the facts to try to make him into who he's not. Let future people come and judge him for who he was, no more and no less
$C: No reason to pretend it never happened. Humans are imperfect and make mistakes, if you only remember the good parts of someone's life you aren't really remembering it.
$C: The dead can be assholes too. That doesn't deny their accomplishments, but doesn't excuse them either. They're people, they're prone to making mistakes and they deserve to be called out on it too. There's no need to only take the good parts or the bad parts, since that wasn't their nature of men when they were alive anyways 
$C: Username does not indeed check out. Your reverence for the dead is cool though.
$C: I didn't downvote you, for what that's worth.
$C: =/= does not equal ‚â†
$C: You're right
$C: It's not that insane. There's a reason Dante placed betrayal as the deepest circle of hell.
$C: From my point of view, the chemists are evil!
$C: The secrets shall lie ahead, however, to obtain them you must pass the trial that is... **Calculus III**! Fuck that class.
$C: but apparently doesn't die.
$C: I can only dream of the day when I die, someone will make prequel memes about it. So to each their own man. 
$C: Honestly, he's not a scientist. He's a technologist. It's almost insulting to actual scientists to call him one. 
$C: I'm an atheist. I'm not agreeing with the Christian saying Hawking went to hell. I think that belief is fucking disgusting.

I'm disagreeing with the other person saying that the person isn't behaving in a manner typical of Christianity.

I'm also criticizing Christianity.
$C: Didn't you just say Stephen Hawking was going to hell because he hates god or whatever? Sounds fairly judgmental to me.

I'm fine with being judged. I try my best to be an alright person. I often make mistakes, sometimes I feed into the cycle of being a judgmental prick to others who are being judgemental pricks. I do enough shitty things for shitty reasons to know I'm far from above-average, let alone perfect. We're all fallible, the difference is one of us admits that.
$C: I know you weren't. The guy was a fucking beast. No way around it.
$C: def CW, cause I wouldn't watch that.
$C: If you've ever seen Groundhog Day, you've heard it. "Seer of seers, prognosticator of prognosticators . . ."
$C: Almost wrote the same comment, cool.
$C: I totally agree, he owned it and made it hip and cool. Was just saying that some older people with those machines might not want the Hawking robot voice, something more human. I will miss his interviews with his machine voice. 
$C: He wrote a number of very popular books, so let's not forget that. But the idea of a brilliant mind in a broken body is also captivating and I think that did have something to do with it. You don't have to look any further than Charles Xavier from X-Men to see that. 
$C: First, I am not saying he *is* virtually Einstein incarnate. Second, you can ask that without sounding rude: Why is he the closest to modern day Einstein?

I am not claiming they attributed the same things, or the same amount. I am saying that he is the closest thing in our present day to Einstein, in intelligence and in individual contribution to science. Yes, it was not the same amount. But it was far more than any other modern person. *That* is what I am saying. Unless you have someone in modern day with greater intellect and contribution to science and humanity, Hawking qualifies as the modern day Einstein. 
$C: From what I understand Einstein had a relatively average intellect compared to other top-physicists from his era, he just had a special gift to think beyond the usual and pursue it. I could be wrong, though; this is just what I heard.

$C: [deleted]
$C: I understand he was far smarter than a "normal human intellect". I said compared to other top-physicists of the time who had IQ's in some cases beyond his. What made him special was not his IQ, it was how he used it.
$C: I like how you still answered that unsarcastically...
$C: I think we could all take a lesson from his book of life. So limited, yet so fulfilled. 
$C: yeah. plebs. they dont understand the truth that the world is a rhombus. and not just ANY rhombus, the most perfect kind of rhombus: a square.

the gravity wraps around the sides and changes direction, so you cant fall off the sides, and because of gods will the corners are all covered in water, and because of the gravity center, and mumbo jumbo the water levels out to appear as if circular.

it appears to be a globe from space, but is in fact, a square.

becuz raisins
$C: Dr. Hawking was entirely irreligious.

And even for those scientists who are religious, they usually have a much more nuanced view of religion than the average theist does. "Meant to be" is such a wishy-washy idea; it doesn't exist.

Hawking lived as long as he did because he was lucky enough to have a slowly moving variant of ALS, and because he was lucky enough to live in a country that believes it's important to ensure everybody has access to necessary medical care. And because he worked his ass off at something that he was brilliant at, and found a joy in living that kept him going.
$C: I didn't will myself into existence.
$C: I don't believe there had to be a why, never said I did. I know we are here because there wasn't life and now there is and the process keeps repeating. 
$C: That's how not why. I know these facts. It's more of a personal question than a scientific.

$C: Woah this hits home... ha ha...
$C: r/me_irl
$C: He communicates with his eyes, not his pinkie.
$C: He must be a Rear Admiral. 
$C: Well if you did though and believed he was a good one you would be naive.
$C: The point is more that they do. 
$C: You say Dr. and a lot of people instantly assume MD. Also if you were to talk to them outside of being a student or meeting them outside of academia it would probably be Dr. although I have known a few who preferred Professor all the time.

Idk about prestigious, I think more a nod of respect to their academic achievements in their post-doctoral work. Dr. is a title on a diploma you get after a bunch of work, Professor is more earned respect of knowledge through years of experience in their chosen field in addition to a title.

$C: +1 for Isaac Arthur. His videos are for a (shockingly large) niche audience but always top quality. 
$C: He was more than a bit of a jerk but yeah.
$C: First of all, you realise Elysium is *in* Hades, right? The Ancient Greek religion's place for the wicked was the Fields of Punishment. And some Ancient Greeks also believed that souls could die a second death in the Underworld and be reincarnated via drinking the waters of the River Lethe. Last I checked, Judaism, Christianity and Islam don't have the concepts of dying in the afterlife and reincarnation 

You're conflating the concept of an afterlife with the Abrahamic and Zoroastrian ideas of Heaven 
$C: No, it‚Äôs true because it‚Äôs been consistently proven in every single experiment conducted regarding it. My point was that, when those experiments are reliable, reproducible, and reputable, they corroborate GR. GR is a fact. You are wrong. You know nothing about science and your trolling is pathetic and deplorable. How about you sit the fuck down kid. 
$C: Wow I'm convinced. Some random nobody on reddit just shut down Einstein and hawking. Do   you     even     science. Man i can't wait for your nobel prize.
$C: Keep going this is great
$C: I didn‚Äôt downvote anything, I promise you that and I think it‚Äôs wrong for people to be down voting you for having a different opinion.  But as an atheist I‚Äôm just trying to understand what you‚Äôre saying.   Yeah it‚Äôs worthy to be considered to most things but don‚Äôt you think if somebody lived their life fighting against he ideas of god or whatever, that should be honored?  I would say the same thing if a Christian died and atheists were saying he‚Äôs dead with no afterlife.   


Edit : Also it‚Äôs fine people are downvoting me too.  People will be people 
$C: Uhhh retard I did tell you why that happens. 

Stars happen because of gravity. Stars die because of fusion. Black holes are formed because of the mass of collapsing star. Why the universe exists isn't a real fucking question, and if your only answer is that god decided it would that still makes you a small minded dumbfuck.

$C: > But it was far more than any other modern person.

That's debatable at best, and extremely unlikely at worst. When it comes to more recent 20th century physicists, I can at least think of Feynman and Witten as individuals who have produced far more important work than Hawking. My interests lie far more in math than physics, so I can't name many more, but I don't doubt they're are others who simply don't have the popularity among laymen that Hawking did.

[Edit]

Weinberg is another that I forgot, and who is definitely in a league of his own as far as his contributions to physics goes.
$C: >Why is he the closest to modern day Einstein?

That doesn't sound rude, sure. But it's also a totally different question than I was asking. 

>Unless you have someone in modern day with greater intellect and contribution to science and humanity, Hawking qualifies as the modern day Einstein.

Pretty much any Nobel Prize winner would qualify there. So there's a list of hundreds. In terms of "contribution to... humanity" none of Hawking's work is likely to ever even inform anything practical. If you meant something like "other physicists contemporary to Hawking who advanced the field more" it's still really not hard. Hawking worked on black holes and quantum cosmology... but there are people (whose best work happened in the 70s and 80s, like Hawking's) who revolutionized all of fundamental physics. This is the time period when the standard model was put together. When inflation was thought up. When renormalization was understood. It's debatable whether or not he's even the most influential person from the 2nd half of the 20th century *in the field of black holes*, although at least at that point I wouldn't think someone was crazy for saying so. 

Hawking is famous *because* of his pop science books (and because of his illness). 

None of this is in any way a put down of him. He had an incredibly successful scientific career, that most researchers would be very jealous of. (And, of course, the fact that he had that career while typing with his cheek muscles is incredible too.) 
$C: Nice deflection, too bad I made no mention of my own intellect in the slightest. Just because you're ignorant and/or stupid, doesn't mean every person that points it out is saying he's smart.
$C: No. He was a very high IQ person--in the 160+ range. You are definitely misremembering.

Feynman reportedly only had a moderatealy gifted IQ--around 120--but had a type of synesthesia which made him able to balance equations subconsciously because he perceived "wrong answers" to be a different color, or something like that. That let him leverage his intelligence much more creatively than most.
$C: It didn‚Äôt have the /s tag when I answered it, and judging by some of the other comments in this thread it‚Äôs clear that the next Stephen Hawking is not amongst us. 
$C: And he got mad pussy.
$C: I wasn't talking about Hawking. I'm aware of his religious beliefs. I was responding to a comment that said *every* scientist would not agree with the phrase "meant to be."

"Meant to be" can mean many things to many different people. In the context of this thread, it was being used as a concept of a greater plan. I don't see how or why a religious scientist would be exempt from this idea. It doesn't go in the face of anything scientific any more or less than other religious beliefs. It's an extremely common belief in Abrahamic religions, and a central tenant to Sikhism.
$C: Yeah but I'm glad someone did for me.
$C: Are you sure? Maybe you did but your current avatar doesn't remember. Have a little faith.
$C: But there doesn't need to be a reason for something to happen. For the sake of argument lets say there is a god or some being who intended us to be here. Then why does that god exist?
$C: I don't see how. There's nothing built in to the universe that says we are "meant" to exist.
$C: No, you are missing the point. Nobody is claiming we shouldn't exist. They're just claiming there is no "should" involved. You're presenting a false dichotomy, suggesting that anybody rejecting the idea that we were meant to be here is claiming that we were meant to *not* be here, or we are supposed to *not* be here. But that's not the opposite that they're trying to convey. They're just trying to say that there's no intent or anything like that involved.

They're saying, "I don't love broccoli, but whatever"

You believe they are saying, "I don't love broccoli, therefore I hate broccoli," and you would be right to say that that doesn't make any sense, but it's not what is being said.

Just because nobody meant for us to be here doesn't mean that someone actively meant for us to not exist. That would be crazy and if someone like that had the power to make their preference happen, then we wouldn't be here, you're right. It just isn't what anybody else is talking about.

"No one is meant to be here" is not the same thing as "Everyone was meant to not be here."
$C: There's a difference between what "should" and what does exist. Should humans exist? No, there is nothing built in to the universe that says humans *should* exist, that humans *have to* exist. 
$C: please netflix pick up s3
$C: Man you're really rocking the boat!
$C: You seems a bit racist as you always emphasize on race every single times.  Would everything be fine for you if Stephen Hawking happened to be an African immigrant with specially bright mind?

$C: >No, it‚Äôs true because it‚Äôs been consistently proven in every single experiment conducted regarding it. My point was that, when those experiments are reliable, reproducible, and reputable, they corroborate GR. 

Space-time has never been proven to exist. There are no experiments conducted with space-time, because it doesn't exist. It can't be reproduced, because it doesn't exist. If it did, then you would be able to link an experiment conducted with RE-created space-time, but you can't because it doesn't exist beyond inscrutable scribbles on a chalk board. 

I encourage you to learn the basics of electricity and electromagnetism. It will lead you to everything you need to know about the universe. In the mean time, try not to sound like such an unoriginal parrot. 

$C: Only children need heroes to worship. Everyone else just needs a basic comprehension of electricity and magnetism to understand how the universe works. No space time or black holes needed.  
$C: First off, thanks. Second off, I definitely understand your question. My answer is no - it would not be the same thing because eternal life is something to look forward to and ceasing to exist is not. Not saying salvation is something you earn, because it‚Äôs not. But a good analogy would be a savings account - say for example my belief is that you will receive interest on your deposits, and your belief is that you will not. If you do not, you would not say congratulations for not receiving any interest. You would, however congratulate someone for receiving lots of interest!

$C: Sure, but just believing in a god or whatever doesn't give you a pass to be shitty to your fellow man. I'm not religious, so forgive me if I'm misinterpreting the bible here, but isn't one of the core tenants of christianity supposed to be love thy neighbor? Religion isn't supposed to be about feeding into a sense of moral superiority or entitlement, it's supposed to be about doing good things for others simply because it's right. Chiming in "hey, you know he's in hell, right?" right after someone dies is wrong. You're just trying to inflict more pain on others by saying stuff like that, and that kind of behavior should go against whatever Christian morals you believe in.

I'm fine with you believing that Stephen Hawking is in hell now, because even though I disagree, those are your beliefs and you're certainly entitled to them. But there are times where it doesn't add anything of value by stating those beliefs publicly.

Edit: Also I know this is all likely just trolling or whatever, but I figured I'd give you the benefit of the doubt. Same argument applies whether it's jesus or being an asshole on the internet, whatever gets your rocks off.
$C: Feynman died over 30 years ago. I was talking about people alive until very recently or still alive.
$C: K. Well seeing as you've found an objective way to measure intelligence I figured you must be a super genius. That's like the crown jewel of all psychology. Like the last century of testing has tried to measure that and fail. 

You should post how you did it on /r/iAmVerySmart 
$C: I understand he was a very high IQ person; but you're not getting what I'm saying. Bohr; Heinsenberg; Hilbert; Schrodinger; Godel etc. all had similar IQ's.

Yes - Einstein was a magnificently intelligent person, one of the smartest in the world, but compared to other top physicists at the time, he was about the same as them.

People confuse having a high IQ with what people do with their IQ and how they use it. Feynman is a perfect example of that - he was BELOW average for his time and still outperformed many other physicists far smarter than him in terms of IQ.

Do you see what I'm saying?
$C: In that case, I take my little jab back, I guess it was a ninja edit. Your explanation (unfortunately) still probably helped out a couple of confused people, lol. You‚Äôre right...not many Hawkings walk among reddit...

$C: I don't need to look up Elysium. I'm familiar with the Greek pantheon and faith. 

What did I say that contradicts this? Elysium is in Hades. Asphodel is in Hades. Punishment is in Hades. Every cunt who died went to Hades, where a panel of judges (who were Kings and Sons of Zeus) decided whether they went to Elysium, Asphodel or Punishment. 

The punishments for most people weren't eternal. And souls could die a second time in Hades and be reborn. They even had their own word for reincarnation : Metempsychosis 

Maybe you should know that the Ancient Greek religion wasn't cut in stone and changed over the centuries it existed.

$C: Impressive memes, you must be very proud. 
$C: its treason, then.
$C: There's nothing hateful about sharing the good news of the Gospel with people who may end up separated from God for all eternity. Hawking was an outspoken Atheist who hated not only God but the idea of God. Despite all his knowlege and deep thinking he disavowed his Creator which is a very grave error.  

Not trolling, just hoping to let his fans know that the path Hawking took was a path toward the most horrible darkness that exists. If you read the two passages of scripture I posted and ask God if it's true then you may understand my motivation is love and not hate. 
$C: You have to be smart enough to enjoy Rick & Morty to understand.
$C: Heisenberg, Bohr, Hilbert, Schrodinger, Godel all made similarly impactful contributions. Einstein didn't really outperform, he worked in different subjects that happened to have more everyday impact.
$C: Why can't the universe be all-encompassing and just be, but a god can?

I prefer the theory where we're an experiment/simulation, at least that one makes sense and is not based on circular logic.
$C: Yes but if something is "meant" to happen, that means it's expected, or *needs* to happen. But there's nothing saying that humans *need* to exist
$C: Meaning is a positive extra thing that we would have to prove exists if we are to agree it does. The burden of proof is on the person who claims something extra exists, not on the person who says they can only know what they can see.

I have no proof that we were meant to exist, and have no proof that we were meant to *not* exist, either. It just really can't play into my understanding of the world because there is no reason for me to believe either situation. You insist that one of these two things is true, but give me no reason, and insist that I give evidence for my position (even though my position is the one that extends into zero speculation about whether we were meant to be or meant to not be around) and then call it insane.

For us to have been meant to be here, or for us to have been meant to not be here, there has to be someone or something doing the meaning, having the intent. That's an unprovable assumption that we just might disagree on, but I will say that it's not something we can safely assume, and as a result I have no reason to even ask whether or not someone or something meant for us to be here or not. That's fine, and it might be just a difference in belief, but it's one that has nothing to do with things that we can know or demonstrate. Doesn't mean either of us is insane, it's just not a question that's even worth bothering to answer with the observation and logic which are used to do science.

I have no reason to believe this sky is made of bananas, even if someone tells me it's true, unless they give me some thing to look at that shows it to me to be true. I have no reason to believe we were meant to be here, based on what I know about the world, unless someone finds something to show me that it's true, and that is impossible, just as much as I can't prove it nonexistent or to prove anything nonexistent. It's just irrelevant, but making a positive claim about meaning is asking something of me without evidence to convince anyone.

$C: Dude, wherever the fuck it‚Äôs located, Elysium is an afterlife paradise, and the rest of hades is an afterlife torture chamber. Just like the Christians came up with. I don‚Äôt understand why you are fighting this. Do you think it makes Christianity special to be the only one to have an afterlife? Because it wouldn‚Äôt matter anyways without proof.
$C: >I‚Äôm a senior physics student in university. Trust me...

Student loans? Or mommy and daddy? That establishes the financial incentive for "schools" to manufacture material to "teach" kids like you. Basic info on electromagnetism can be found online, but that's much less profitable than the university industrial complex. 


$C: Oh, I already knew you didn‚Äôt have an answer, as people WAY smarter than you haven‚Äôt been able to riddle that one out, including Hawking himself.

Just wanted to see you squim with it. Your obscenity laced retort was about the level I expected from such a classic Redditard.

As you were, numbskull.
$C: He wasn‚Äôt born unable to work...
$C: Was it the allegedly abusive wife he may have cheated on, or was it hits first wife?
$C: Hello there
$C: He definitely contributed more to the human race than they did. But my point is really just about the fact that they more or less had similar IQ levels as him. So you could ask - why did Einstein do better? Most people assume it's because he was just way smarter; but I'd argue it's more to do with how he used his intelligence and not his intelligence alone. Two people with the same IQ may have differing propensities for conforming for instance and this may allow the non-conformist to have 'access' to more potentially good ideas that can be pursued.

Also I'd suggest that IQ has very little with work ethic. I don't know the specifics here, but it's also likely Einstein was just a really hard worker and so he was able to maximize the output of his intelligence. 

But yeah, it's not surprising I was downvoted the way I was; people just don't care to look at things from a nuanced perspective these days, everything has to just be clear cut with no exceptions.
$C: The universe can be all-encompassing and just be. If god exists, it can also be all-encompassing and just be. I don‚Äôt really agree that god existing is inherently illogical/based on circular reasoning. 

The simulation/experiment makes sense, but that only means that god is all-encompassing relative to us. So if we are in an experiment I‚Äôll be first to say; the dude who programmed us is a bit of a narcissist and liar. That programmer, although he told us he is ultimate and one, is just one of the many more advanced beings. 

I don‚Äôt agree that god being all-encompassing is illogical or based on circular reasoning. There are ‚Äúlogical‚Äù explanations that can direct you towards or write out. Frankly, the ‚Äúlogic‚Äù does make sense to me, yet sometimes it makes more sense than other times. 



$C: [deleted]
$C: Mate do you even know anything about the Greek afterlife?

No, the rest of Hades isn't "hell". The only part that is comparable to hell is Tartaros, "The Pit". And the only ones kept in Tartaros were great enemies of the gods like the Titans who fought them in the Titanomachy, and kinslayers like Tantalus according to  some myths (others claim he was sent to Punishment). Asphodel was the empty field where people who were neutral (ie most people) wandered around for eternity. In fact the Catholic concept of Limbo was inspired by Asphodel.

Punishment is for people who did more evil than good, but it wasn't the be-all-end-all for those sentenced. The sentence Hades (the god) gave out to wrong-doers was proportional to the crime, and it was finite. Once it was complete, the souls were free to stay in Asphodel or drink from the Lethe, lose all memory, and be reincarnated.

Please show me how Zoroastrianism, Christianity and Islam have anything comparable to this. Heaven and Hell in Zoroastrianism and Abrahamic religions (except Judaism) is eternal and decided by belief instead of actions. There is no leeway and no such thing as reincarnation. Also Zoroastrian, Christian and Muslim theology claims that eventually an Apocalypse will come and a savior (Saoshyant/Messiah/al-Mahdi) will arrive in the world, fight their demonic antithesis (Antichrist/Dajjal) in the case of Christianity and Islam, and all humans will be judged and sent to either Heaven or Hell.

Ergo, the Zoroastrian/Christian/Muslim idea of heaven is a far cry from the afterlife of Greek polytheism.

PS -
 Maybe you're getting the idea that I'm a Jesus lover. No mate, I'm an agnostic atheist raised in a Hindu household. I'm not a fan of any faith, let alone the three worst ones that supposedly came from Abraham.

I don't know why you'd ask that. He didn't do anything better.

You're begging the question.
$C: I don't get what you mean. We exist, obviously, but so many things could've happened differently which would lead to us never existing. 
$C: We were discussing an afterlife in other religions. Wherever any of these fake places are ‚Äúlocated‚Äù makes no difference to the fact that they have a ‚Äúheaven‚Äù and ‚Äúhell‚Äù. 
Of course all religions have slightly different versions, but that bears no consequence on what we are talking about.
$C: Whatever you have to tell yourself, Holmes.

The very first theory relating to the Big Bang, from which both Einstein and Hawking developed their theses, came from Lemaitre, who was a Catholic Priest, sooo...

I know you think yourself edumacated, but you‚Äôre really just an angry little man screaming into the wind.

As you were.
$C: Uhm? Over 21 years? He was diagnosed with ALS at 21. took also a few years till he could not walk anymore IIRC. Pretty sure he didn‚Äôt forgot 1/3 of his life 
$C: Yeah, that's what I was getting at
$C: Oh, he for sure did better (his fame is not in any way unmerited). He was at least 15 years ahead of his time. Giving us the two most important theories in modern science is not really something other people could top. So yeah, I ask the question - why him? I'm certainly open to the idea that he really was just smarter in some way, but I'd suggest it's more to do with how he specialized his brain (or how it specialized itself).
$C: [deleted]
$C: Yeah and my point is that afterlife =/= heaven/hell

Let me use, as an example, Hindusim, the faith I was raised in- it has an afterlife. You reincarnate again and again until you've lost all your base desires and have become a "sanniyasi" (enlightened one). Then you meditate in harmony with nature without consuming any nourishment, and you will achieve true ascendence (moksha) in which your soul leaves your earthoy body and merges with the Great Spirit (paramatma) and you just exist, enlightened in peace and harmony for eternity. Bit misleading to call that afterlife a "Heaven" in the Classical sense though. Also, like you may have noticedthere is no Hell in Hindusim.

So it's a bit misleading to state that an afterlife is synonymous with the Christian and Muslim idea of heaven and hell.
$C: Im well aware, I dont blame people in the early 20th century for their beliefs, I blame idiots like you in the 21st with constant access to knowledge for their small mindedness.
$C: So it seems like the main basis of your argument is that the universe is deterministic. The universe will always take the same path given the same initial conditions. So how do you explain Bell's theorem?
$C: The Elysian Fields and Tartarus are essentially heaven and hell
$C: And yet the question still remains how stars formed from anything but a cycle of big bangs and black holes.

Keep deflecting knucklehead.
$C: Except the residents of Tartaros are immortal gods and monsters like Kamp√´, not humans.

Humans went to Punishment, where once they served their sentence, they were free to chill in Asphodel or be reincarnated. Which is nothing like Christian/Muslim Heaven.
$C: Human when they die either go to paradise or to be tortured to pay for their sins. Very very similar to Christian afterlife. Give me a break
$C: No.

When humans die in the Ancient Greek religion, they either 

a) Enter Elysium if they were a hero of note

b) Stay in Asphodel and chill for eternity if they weren't particularity good/evil

c) Go to Punishment temporarily and serve a punishment for their crimes as judged by the Judges of the Underworld and the god Hades after which they can go to Asphodel or be reincarnated

d) Be Elysium or Asphodel worthy and choose to reincarnate

e) Reincarnate thrice and be chosen to enter Elysium three times in which case they can enter The Isles of the Blest, which is basically Super Elysium

f) Be cartoonishly evil and try to overthrow or confront the Olympians themselves and be thrown to Tartaros (like I said, this is ridiculously rare, as in, lottery numbers)

This is vastly different from the Heaven/Hell in Christianity/Islam. In fact, the closest thing to "Heaven" in the Greek pantheon is Mount Olympus, residence or the Olympian gods save for Hades. And no human ends up there. Only a couple of ridiculously heroic/lucky demigods like Heracles and Dionysus ended up becoming Olympians.
$C: Practically the same thing. Just some bs to make you not fear death
$C: Very different.

One encourages you to prioritising doing good and reassures you that even if you screw up, there's always a second chance.

The other demands you to believe in specific tenets or suffer for eternity 
$C: How are those ‚Äúvery different‚Äù? Both require you to follow a set of rules or be punished for eternity. The slight difference, that you just pointed out, is that the Christian god will let you into heaven if you beg forgiveness and then go back to following his rules. They are the same basic philosophy. Listen to me and be rewarded; don‚Äôt listen and you will suffer
$C: Are you being obtuse in purpose? I literally said that in Ancient Greek religion, you're punished for your **deeds**, not your beliefs. They believed that you could worship any goddamned cult you want. Hell, some philosophers like Epicurus promoted empiricism and were not persecuted for it. 

And the punishments in Hades were **finite**. Once you served them, you were free to join Asphodel or reincarnate. How can you not comprehend this?  Are you for real? 
$C: Hahahaha I can‚Äôt believe you think these are large distinctions. Your deeds are all that matter in Judaism, which Christianity was born out of. And man, in Christianity, is being punished for his sins. The fact that you can use Jesus as a scapegoat to get to heaven does not mean that you aren‚Äôt being judged for your works.
Finite or not, it is an afterlife that rewards or punishes based on your life, and gives you a way to not think that your life ends when you die. It‚Äôs the same fucking shit in different packaging. Wake up bruh
$C: You think finite vs infinite is not an important distinction?

It's literally the biggest possible distinction. Try to comprehend what infinity means mate. Then think about how bloody terrible it must be to suffer for fucking **infinitely**.
$C: They either live forever in eternal judgement, or infinitely reincarnate, facing judgement in between each reincarnation

#Not a big distinction
