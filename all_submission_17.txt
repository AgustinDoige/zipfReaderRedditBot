Bollywood at it finest.

$C: That was pretty slick, I wonder how many takes it took to get it just right.
$C: That's actually hilariously badass.
$C: I thought they would use their shields to stear or even glide.


But that would probably have looked unrealistic, huh?
$C: I want to watch this whole movie please state the name 
$C: I can't wait for r/trebuchetmemes to show up for this.
$C: Like... I can laugh up until the two guys land.

That was the most badass thing
$C: You can tell it's not realistic by the way they hold their shields after they land.
$C: That was totally wicked!
$C: Should let bollywood make the dc movies 
$C: He lands like, "ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?!"
$C: It's like every day dream I had in middle school.  it's fantastic.
$C: That was hard as fuck
$C: I would run the fuck away from these super Saiyan warrior. Fuck that noise.
$C: "Never thought I'd see Baahubali on reddit front page.. oh this is on /r/funny. Yeah sounds about right. "
$C: This is a documentary on how the Greeks conquered Troy. There was no Trojan horse, that's just a myth.
$C: This movie was so good. Took us 6hrs to watch part 1 and 2.

It’s available on netflix
$C: This movie is actually dope. It was India's most expensive movie when made and it broke all sorts of records.
Its called Baahubali, and it's on Netflix. Do yourself a favor and watch it.
$C: This is from Baahubali part 2. Originally a Telugu movie dubbed into many other languages. Not actually considered a part of Bollywood. The movie has many other gems like that. 
$C: Her, "My parents aren't home tonight."

Me, "I'll see you 5 minutes."
$C: Serious question.  What Bollywood movie (trailer) was posted on Reddit several months ago with a bunch of dudes dancing, swinging swords and looking cool as fuck was it?  I've never been able to find it and truly want to watch it.
$C: When did GoT start making sense?
$C: Thanks for this OP, I went looking for more clips on Youtube and ended up watching the whole movie - it's frikkin awesome. 
$C: I haven’t seen many Bollywood flicks but the ones I’ve seen were really enjoyable 
$C: The dude that cuts the rope is smiling like he knows this is about to be some funny shit
$C: MAHENDRAAAA BAAAHUUUUBAAALIIIII! Fucking glorious movie :)
$C: You know...as cheesy as that was, it was still pretty awesome.

Can you imagine someone from like 50 years ago seeing that? They'd lose their goddamned minds.
$C: Not gonna lie, that kinda looked dope.
$C: That was cheesy as hell, but actually pretty great
$C: Both the movies are in YouTube for Free in the Original language (Telugu) with English Subtitles.

$C: I grin like an idiot at that bollywood shit.  I tell you hwat.
$C: [removed]
$C: what what what what
$C: Say what you will, that was pretty awesome.
$C: /r/BollywoodRealism
$C: Hahaha... Didn't expect to see baahubali at the top of Reddit. 
$C: I was expecting them to Dance on the tree 
$C: Still better CGI then the last Transformers film.
$C: It's not more ridiculous than the average "Avenger" action scene...
$C: I love the effort in trying to get the physics right at the end....... that's awesome.

$C: This is not bollywood.   
Bollywood makes movies in hindi.   
This movie is not in Hindi but in Telugu.
$C: "Give me 6 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch."
$C: Hollywood take notes.
$C: I was gonna upload this! Fuck, missed the oppourtunity for karma boost :S

Also, it's Tollywood.

Also, angry birds.
$C: They cut off the best part! After he lands and looks up, he has a close up where he looks up AGAIN.
$C: I bet our movies are boring as shit to them
$C: Offended south indians like me, pls line up.
This maybe ridiculous but I can't see bollywood getting proxy credits. 
$C: That's tollywood for you. 
$C: I was excited for John Wick 3 but screw that, this looks awesome!
$C: Still less corny and more realistic than Aquaman surfing on a space demon.
$C: No more far fetched than any marvel movies
$C: Gotta step up your game here, Hollywood.
$C: Looks better than the million dollars CGI craps in hollywood.
$C:  Am drunk as shit right now and I think obly someone in my state of mind can understand what I just saw
$C: You can't laugh at this stuff and take superhero movies seriously. 
$C: man china and japan has a lot of competition on the ridiculous action scene awards
$C: As a man born in India this is my proudest moment. Thank you Reddit.
$C: This is actually a Tollywood film.

Tollywood = Telugu film industry.

Bollywood = Hindi film industry.

Both Indian? Yes. The more you know. 
$C: I'd just like to point out that the makers of this film have actually made both [Baahubali - The Beginning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5FvgdI6h-c), and [Baahubali 2: The Conclusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9770lB6E2M) available on YouTube... with subtitles... in 4K... for free.

Pretty awesome for people that don't have Netflix!
$C: Checking in three hours later. This was the most epic movie ive ever seen. Fuck Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Baahubali reigns supreme. On to number two.  
$C: First off, if you haven't watched these movies, they are absolutely fucking insanely good. There are plenty of english dubbed versions online. Actually, here you go:

[Baahubali: The Beginning](https://ondramanice.io/baahubali-the-beginning/watch-baahubali-the-beginning-episode-1-online)

Edit: The first one is also on Netflix. Have fun with those 6 hours of your life haha

Baahubali: The Conclusion is on Netflix I believe!

The story is very, very good :) This scene is from The Conclusion, and what it doesn't show is that the entire army literally started slingshotting themselves over the wall after these guys flew through. Hilarious and awesome lol

And btw, this counts as Tollywood, which is like ~~Tamil~~ Telugu Bollywood lol, the Bollywood of the south!

Edit: I enjoyed the movies because the Hindi dubbing is hilarious and great overall. I haven't watched it in English subtitles or dubbed for that matter, so I apologize for leading you astray
$C: Still better than Justice League.
$C: That looks like the Indian version of a Steven Chow movie. I would be in board with that...
$C: Whoever likes this scene needs to watch this movie. Bahubali 2! Full of crazy, almost-possible-until-you-realise-physics-is-a-thing action scenes just like this one. 
$C: ok make fun of bollywood all yah want but that was pretty damn fly
$C: Still more believable than Princess Leia flying through space.
$C: That was actually entertaining. Anyways, you see a North God fighting with a green super mutant and you don't bat an eye. Come on
$C: *Tollywood. It’s a telugu movie so didn’t tollywood produce it technically
$C: oh my god its Bahuballi 2 the conclusion! Jesus i never thought id see this on reddit.


Okay story time. Ive watched this epic three times already and just about finished the first one and boy oh boy is it a trip and a half. This goes beyond regular bollywood.


The first time i was bored and sober and i was all like woah this is a masterpiece, the second time i was high as fuck off a few edibles and it was even more intense. Then i took 7 grams of shrooms and IT BLEW MY MIND! the final fight scene in this movie is so fucking cool and so god fucking damn satisfying that the whole two god damn movies are one giant symbolic build up to the death of the antagonist. 

Please do yourselves a favoure and watch this beautiful piece of art
$C: Is it ridiculous?

Yes.

Is it conceptually awesome?

Fuck yeah.
$C: I mean, it is excessive, but we love to take the piss out of Bollywood. This is well executed and there's many mainstream western movies that have had similar if not worse scenes. Even lotr with legolas sledging on a shield firing arrows for example. I don't know why, but i just feel its unfair to have this in r/funny 
$C: Man, just clips of these movies series makes everyone in the 300 movies seem like total pussies.
$C: Baahubali 2! I actually really enjoyed this movie haha
$C: I love how it's not even young dudes, it's like an 70 year old man. 
$C: This is tollywood, mate. Films from Andhra Pradesh, known for making the most ridiculous sci-fi films seem down to earth and sensible. 
$C: Hollywood fucking wishes they were this creative. 
$C: Not far off of Marvel imo... 
$C: About 12 years ago I was listening to a song and a youtube video was randomly playing that a friend sent me. It magically matched up. [Enjoy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLliWBA_2uk)
$C: Bollywood at it's finest?  Or Bollywood on another average Tuesday?

[I'll let you decide](https://m.imgur.com/UDdx7MG?r)
$C: is this really any more ridiculous than the marvel comic book shit movies?
$C: r/bollywoodrealism
$C: I will take this over Zach Snyder's bullshit green screening. Any. Day. Of. The. Week.
$C: I really don't see how this is more absurd than the usual Holy Wood bs.
$C: TIL I should watch Indian films.
$C: If this really is Baahubali part 2 as /u/snorcack mentioned, then it has an 8.5 on IMDb.

I'm not really sure how it all works, but that would seem to indicate that it is as popular as:

* Saving Private Ryan
* The Pianist
* The Departed
* Terminator 2
* Back to the Future
* Whiplash
* Gladiator
* Memento
* Apocalypse Now, and
* The Prestige (my actual favorite movie of all time, ever)
$C: Just watched the first part tonight, brilliant! Beautiful backgrounds and music, and tons of unbelievable ridiculous stunts that are just so awesome you don't care. Highlights include jumping off a cliff only to fire an arrow mid fall into a tree that has a rope attached, and a horse kick flipping up a sword for the hero.
$C: They had a very shitty budget but still managed to make an awesome movie. 
$C: To be fair, nobody would bat an eyelid if this were anime. It's just they prefer live action madness. Fair play to them!
$C: I want to say this is from Bahubali. It’s either the first movie or the second one. (I think it’s the second one, it’s been a while since I’ve seen them) Awesome movies BTW. 

Anywho... both are available on Netflix (I think) if you want to watch them. 
$C: Is this considered a barrel roll?
$C: It really captures the majesty and brutality of ancient warfare. 
$C: Officially the best thing I've ever seen. Thank you OP
$C: Shit, is this Bahubali 2?
$C: If Saruman would have thought of this the fellowship would have gotten rekt
$C: The trebuchet guys are going to raise hell over this...
$C: They need Bollywood directors to make the next live action Dragon Ball Z movie.  They are just absurd enough for it to be amazing.
$C: Better than Justice League.
$C: We also invented the Kama Sutra. 
$C: This is a tale of a young prince, who is turned into a gruesome monster on his coronation day. The throne and entire kingdom is held hostage by the high priest, thrown into despair, the queen mother and her subjects awaits the return of their one true heir.
https://youtu.be/k7r14zu1PfU
$C: Every time I see a crazy Bollywood clip like this I think to myself... why do I not watch more of these.

EDIT: I am sure I can find subtitle versions of stuff... or maybe ill just learn Indiant.
$C: This is glorious.
$C: Except it is NOT bollywood.
$C: I never understood why people, instead of putting chainmail on their arms like sane people, instead goes to show off their biceps
$C: Obligatory this is nt Bollywood, but some other wood comment
$C: Indian in India here, didn't watch both parts of the movie (this is pt 2 btw), this is the highest standard attained by a Bollywood (read Tollywood) action-fantasy movie in India thus far, massively promoted and widely watched, and I suggest this for the sub /r/blackmagicfuckery. (#WKKB)
$C: r/science explain how this is possible ^^^/s
$C: In all seriousness Indian CG is coming along.


$C: Better than The Last Jedi
$C: [deleted]
$C: The Knights Radiant look much different than I imagined...
$C:  that's kind of amazing
$C:  Bollywood is so awesome
$C: Most awesome thing I've seen all day
$C: I want to live in Bollywood movie world 
$C: Suck it, Legolas.
$C: Bollywood is basically live action anime.
$C: Their CGI is fucking on point!
$C: Baahubali 1&2 are amazing! Reminds me of dragon ball in india. 

Also great soundtrack too. 
$C: We should honestly review Hollywood movies and take their essence and morph them into video games. 
$C: This would've been more realistic with the trebuchet, the superior siege weapon.
$C: Okay, but if I saw that in a movie it'd be an immediate 10/10
$C: Mate that is fucking amazing
$C: And that's how the next Indo-China battles will play out. 

China got PLA, India got CGI (Catapult Guys of India) thanks /u/AusCan531 
$C: Is this a deleted scene from The Hobbit?
$C: My loony bun is fine Benny lava.
$C: "based on a true story"
$C: That's so fucking awesome
$C: [More from Bollywood](https://streamable.com/s/qkv0t/vpwvwm)
$C: It just keeps getting better and better.

Fucking hell that was beautiful.
$C: Guys this is from the movie Bahubaali Part 2, if you want to watch it please watch Bahubaali Part 1 first then Part 2. It’s actually pretty good and worth watching. Only if you watch part 1, you’ll understand the story
$C: I can imagine this being a totally dumb question, but seeing as some Indian people make the seemingly-unintentional funniest shit ever, is it a premeditated thing or just plain luck?
$C: History is amazing.

$C: I refuse to believe that old dude who cut the rope survived that. C’mon man! Having said that, if this sequel is anywhere near as spectacular as the first film, I’m all over this tonight. 
$C: No CGI either, credit to the stunt men.
$C: Well at least they didn't use three-point-super-hero-landing-pose.
$C: why does non-indian cinema even bother?
$C: I wonder what they talked about when they were all face to face in that shield circle flying through the air.
$C: Just like in Hollywood but with lower budget. Same bs logic. 
$C: Rare footage of Ottoman warriors attacking an unknow fortress. 
Date unknown. 
$C: God bless Indians and their glorious filmfindustry
$C: Still better than Justice League.. 
$C: Is this the same movie where they shoot giant flammable-liquid-soaked blankets over the battlefield out of catapults and then ignite them with fire arrows?
$C: That was fucking lit!
$C: here's another great scene with arrows in the same film https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKL75628ubA
$C: I'm just mad that, in all my years of playing D&D, I never tried to get my party to do this.
$C: Reminds me of something from the Kingsmen movies
$C: This is amazing, that dude a fucking bad ass. Did you see that fucking pose at the end? The next scene is all his enemies dying from fear and awe, has to be.
$C: Bollywood movies are like real-life anime.
$C: Bollywood production quality looks like it's gone way up in the past few years
$C: This is no less believable than walking at the bottom of the ocean under an upside down lifeboat like in Pirates of the Caribbean 
$C: I swear to god, every time I open up the main page of Reddit, and I see the word "Bollywood" I fucking grin, because I know my day is about to start off on a high note. 

Fucking A, man, I'm gonna go listen to the singham song.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BM0PnqV5-iM
$C: This is what Project Badass would look like if it had a high enough budget. 
$C: What's more impressive is it seems one of the men was able to change pants while in mid flight from blue to red. 
$C: Its not Bollywood its Bahubali - 2 Telugu movie
$C: U.S. Forces breach the German defensive line on the beaches of Normandy. 1944. Colorized.
$C: That was cool, but they could’ve gotten further if it was a trebuchet 
$C: I rather watch this than any of the Sharknado movies. 
$C: Man, John Wick 3 looks crazy. 
$C: And still way better than the Avengers! 
$C: Man, their CGI is way better than Justice League's.
$C: Still a more believable stunt than anything from the last several Fast N Furious movies.
$C: I would watch the shit out of this 
$C: It is not Bollywood, by the way.
$C: Here you go anyone looking for source in a Youtube video that plays at the right point.
https://youtu.be/H9770lB6E2M?t=2h22m10s

It also gets crazy when they all start doing it. Good watch. Pirates of the Carribbean/Kingsman type humor and music.

EDIT: words
$C: It's on Netflix U.S. guys... there goes my afternoon.
$C: Omg, that was awesome, I just spent 6 hours on 1 and 2. I need mooore of this stuff please!
$C: Tree-buchet
$C: That's badass

$C: Say what you want about bollywood films, they sure do know how to make a fuckin set piece.
$C: This is just as believable as any other Hollywood superhero or fantasy movie. This is clearly fantasy, so what's the big deal?
$C: That's sincerely very cool. 
$C: Gotta give them points for creativity though.
$C: Not so different from Marvel movies
$C: Guys it's actually Tollywood
$C: Sorry to disappoint, but I think this is CGI guys
$C: The guy cutting the rope is a huge meme in India
$C: Looks like something out of Baron Munchausen.
$C: A solid submission- but I present-

TRULY- Bollywood at it's finest-

https://youtu.be/gfoaogJN_pw?t=1m30s
$C: Absolutely ridiculous. In the scene where the palm launches them, they are clearly seen shooting past the first wall. How is it then that the subsequent shots have them landing on the wall. What an unrealistic scene.
$C: Bhai! Katappa ne Bahubali ko kyu mara?
$C: This is a telugu film not bollywood 

This is the only scene that's really out there but overall Bahubali 2 is incredible..Must watch 
$C: I’ve seen worse in top Hollywood productions. 
$C: This is "Baahubali 2 - The Conclusion" for anyone who wants to watch the rest. It's on Netflix right now. Its like a bunch of Shakespeare plays, Matrix slow-mo fighting, Thor demigod level feats of ludicrous badass-ness, and 300 scale battles all rolled into one. This is the most bonkers moment in the movie, but minus this and bad CGI for the animals, it's genuinely one of my favorite movies ever.

Baahubali 1 is way worse. And a lot more molest-y. And you don't really miss anything plot-wise if you skip it. 

I recommend you skip it.
$C: This is not Bollywood, its Tollywood
$C: As funny as this gif is, its not Bollywood, its Tollywood!
$C: It's not Bollywood, but [Tollywood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_cinema).  
  
The scene is from [Baahubali 2](http://m.imdb.com/title/tt4849438/)
$C: No but seriously what the fuck.
$C: Bahubali 1&2 are actually pretty good movie..you cannot compare them with the Hollywood big budget movie..both movies were made under 36 million dollars..captain america and iron man's budget was 250 million dollars..watch bahubali 1&2 , i promise you they will not disappoint you !! 

$C: I love the LOTR films but this clip is still more realistic than Legolas and Gimli at the battle for Helms Deep. 

$C: This south Indian movie bahubali 2 is not all that Bad. Its much better than other Indian movies which usually follow a convenient formula without any creativity. 
The narrative is that of an Epic, so you have to accept that the characters are super powered.  But this particular scene (and some other too in the two part series)  was too much. Kind a ruined the Movie for me.
$C: It's tollywood you ignoramus. 
$C: Thats not bollywood. Its regional language film which became one of the highest grosser in India.

But this freaking scene made the whole movie a joke.
$C: It's Tollywood actually, Bollywood's got nothing more than businessmen 😑
$C: r/bollywoodrealism for all your Bollywood needs. 
$C: When u & the squad are all under 21 and gotta get creative to sneak into the club 🔥🔥🔥
$C: HEY THATS TOLLYWOOD NOT BOLLYWOOD. THIS WAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST GROSSING FILMS IN INDIAN HISTORY AND NOW THE HINDI PEOPLE (BOLLYWOOD) ARE TAKING CREDIT FOR A MOVIE THAT TELUGU PEOPLE MADE
$C: This isn't Bollywood, it's a Telugu film that was dubbed into other languages.
$C: This is amazing
$C: Omg lol I kinda expected after they formed the "wheel" they would roll down the ramp. Still awesome!
$C: Trojan bullet 
$C: It’s no R-Rahjkumar
$C: that genuinely looks like a good strat,lol
$C: This is some Asterix and Obelix level stuff. And I have to admit - it makes "Mission Impossible" stunts just a little bit more plausible...
$C: This out does Hammer films in cheese. Brilliant
$C: That was the coolest action sequence ever.
$C: Bahubali Bahubali
$C: BAAAAAHUBALLIIIIIII!!!! katappa
$C: I wanted to work in film when I was younger, now I know what exactly I want to work on. 
$C: I would watch this movie...
$C: That was an amazing movie. Make sure to watch part one before watching this. 
It's called Baahubali by the way.
$C: I want to see that movie!!
$C: That was done really well. The end is pretty fucking cool.
$C: Ahh I see it is a real life goblin barrel from Clash Royale.
$C: Well, this does look way more entertaining than transformers
$C: That's some next level power ranger shit.
$C: “When D&D players get really creative and REALLY lucky.”
$C: Baahubali 2! Honestly a really good movie, I enjoyed it 100%. It's on Netflix. And you don't need to see the first one to understand the story for this one
$C: DarkSouls.gif
$C: When the squad hitting the club.
$C: This is basically anime
$C: CGI was a gift to Indian cinema.
$C: who needs a trampoline anyway
$C: That's the same amount of ridiculous while being self-aware as in Hollywood films. Specials effects at the level of B+ movies. For now.

Comparing this to what Bollywood made 5 years ago... Hollywood you're out! You're shitty, preachy, expensive and everyone hates you but there was no alternative. 

Now we just neet good dubbing company to bring us those treasures.
$C: That was honestly one of the greatest things I've ever seen.
$C: I'd watch it
$C: That's How We Do It In My Garden...
$C: Peter Jackson never thought about this
$C: Those effects were far better than any Filipino movie I've seen my mom watch.
$C: It's our Indian angry bird.....lol
$C: This is anime af
$C: Cinema Sins: "They survived this" *Ping*
$C: Spartans? Pussies! 
$C: its*
$C: This is when you realized.... your city is fucked. 
$C: The pinnacle of human evolution
$C: All the live action anime fans may see this to please themselves. 
$C: Guys you can use this technique to cross any border, no need for any visas :D
$C: Fuck reality and the fatal broken bones , the scene was badass.
$C: that was legit. like some kung fu hustle comedy. i like it.
$C: Would they call that a Treebuchet?
$C: I would watch the shit out of this film. 
$C: I fucking LOVE Bollywood.
$C: I need to watch this movie. 
$C: Hollywood has done much worse.
$C: Instead of r/indianpeoplefacebook they should just have an r/indianpeople
$C: Ah! Bollywood! Even physics takes a backseat when it comes to Bollywood.
$C: Yeah, you say that now. Just wait till the next Fast & Furious does it with cars. you'll lap that shit up. 
$C: where's the dancing
$C: Not going to lie, the special effects actually look good.
$C: This is what a remake of Troy needs.
$C: When your entire Party is all Dex Fighters and you need to get into the big bad's fortress.
$C: Reminds me of the scenes I would come up with as a kid messing around with action figures
$C: those war movies they make are fucking awesome. 
$C: This is amazing! Is there a video source?
$C: This is like if they took all of the over the top action from anime and put it into live action, and it looks *amazing!*
$C: That's actually not a bollwood movie. It's part of Tollywood.
$C: This...is possibly the best thing I have ever seen.
$C: 
The same director made a film back in 2012 Eega. A story of a dead guy who comes back reincarnated as a house fly to save his girlfriend from the villain. Check it out. https://youtu.be/lbWURFD4vdE 
$C: Ya'll ever seen Singham???
$C: This movie was actually lit. I work for a theater that played this and this franchise is very popular. I dont remember whether it was in tamil or telegu. But they almost always have english subtitles. Plus the soundtracks are lit. Im a 20yo white guy, and this movie was really good when i was able to see parts of it.

I know im gunna butcher the name, but its called something along the lines of Ba-ahu bali. But said more fluently than i can type.
$C: When I used to work as an usher at the movie theater, I remember doing a theater check for this movie and being like "what the fuck is this im definitely doing more checks in this theater for sure"
$C: They would've destroyed the entire castle had they used a Trebuchet.
$C: The best part is the glee of the old bearded guy as he cuts the thing
$C: There hasn't been a Marvel movie with a sequence this slick.
$C: You make fun of this but, this is basically every Avengers movie. 
$C: Folks if you don't know, the entire movie is available in **4k in YouTube.** [You're Welcome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9770lB6E2M)
$C: Hollywood is lacking in creativity like this.
$C: What is the name of this Bollywood film? Honestly looks good lol
$C: Trump get ready! Mexicans now  have a new efficient smuggling model
$C: It's Telugu. A totally different language. And a different movie industry.
$C: This is like something straight out of a "Monty python" sketch
$C: I hope the rest of the movie is similarly... believable. It would be a shame if there is just one scene like this.
$C: If it was in fast and the furious 11 you'd be gobbling it up
$C: Thats actually Tollywood...not Bollywood!
$C: That’s actually Tollywood which makes movies in Telugu language. The second largest film industry next to Bollywood in India. 
$C: Bout damn time yall got acquainted with it properly. But this isn’t Bollywood (Hindi, made in Bombay) it’s Tollywood (Telugu, made in Andhra Pradesh) both are lit AF 
$C: 41k updoots in 3 hours :0
$C: Dont think this gold ,untill you watch this https://youtu.be/jhQzbavc4n0
$C: Wait is this movie considered Bollywood? Isn’t it telugu? Not sure if they have their own film thing 
$C: Which one is the main character, you ask?  The only one of these flying maniacs who's so cool he doesn't need a helmet.  

The most badass of the badass never wear helmets.
$C: Sadly, this is no sillier than any of the CG stunts in the Hobbit movies.
$C: Watch both parts Bahubali 1 and 2..you will see some crazy badass scenes 😂
$C: ...I gotta watch more Bollywood. 
$C: This could have just as easily happened in the Hobbit tbh.
$C: Bollywood vs Hollywood is the aame comparison as Saints Row 4 vs Grand Theft Auto V
$C: The archers were still aiming outside the castle even after those badass guys landed inside of it! XD
$C: I recommend watching Baahubali: The Beginning first. It's a really fun movie with awesome battles and to then the second one. 5hours bollywood maybe go later eat some tamil or indian food.
$C: Atleast it dosent look as fake as twd.
$C: Doesn't seem much more ridiculous than half the shit Legolas got up to in the Rings movies. At least none of them invented three new arm joints while trying to mount a galloping horse or climbed falling masonry blocks.
$C: TBH, the motion trajectories are surprisingly convincing to me.

EDIT: Just watched the trailer, the movie looks amazing.
$C: This is on Netflix and it’s actually my favourite movie of all time !!
$C: this seems redicoulous, what movie is this?
it might be fun to watch
$C: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4849438/

Almost $300M at the BO
$C: TBH I like their imagination
$C: Fuck, I need to watch more Bollywood. That is batshit.
$C: Micheal Bay would be proud. Though he would have added an explosion to the landing.
$C: Film title anyone? I'm sold. 
$C: Reminds me of that scene in Dragonball where this old guy breaks a pillar, jumps on it, and flies away on it.
$C: When that warrior formation flew overhead, my mind made tie fighter swooping sound effects.
$C: These to movies are actually pretty good. Weird and the acting isn't amazing, but good...
$C: Baahubali! Best frigin movies ever!
$C: This was my brother's least favourite scene in the entire movie cuz it looks too extra.
$C: Yeah that scene ruined the movie for me, but actually rest of the movie is pretty neat and its the second most highest grossing Indian movie of all time.
$C: The exact moment when you realise this is a southern movie and not  a Bollywood movie 🤯.
$C: This is badass! Hahahaa!
$C: It's not Bollywood though
$C: Not Bollywood.
$C: Well, this isn't Bollywood in the first place. 
$C: ahem, that's Tollywood actullay.
$C: Oh man, is all Bollywood like this? If at least some, I have some movies to watch this weekend.
$C: More believable than surviving a nuclear explosion in a fridge
$C: This is from a film called Bahubali which is a medieval fantasy. Some creative licences can be taken.
$C: I remember watching this! This is Bahubali 2: The Conclusion. 7/7 would recommend watching this and the part before this.
$C: This is not bollywood, it is actually Tollywood. 
$C: God I love these people
$C: Little known fact that these actors do their own stunts.
$C: The fuck did I just watch? O_o
$C: I can’t see any cgi here
$C: I love it
$C: That's a pretty sweet move still more believable than Hollywood
$C: [deleted]
$C: Wow, their movies are just on a whole different level 
$C: This was actually really brilliant, in such an absurd way.
$C: Title? 
$C: Not gonna lie here, that was pretty cool.
$C: Sorry to burst everyone’s bubble, but this actually isn’t a Bollywood movie. The original language of this movie is Telugu, which isn’t under the same film industry. This is actually a Tollywood movie.
$C: It's not Bollywood. Its Tollywood.
$C: I really love how Bollywood seems to emanate such a joy for life. They really put it out there, and that's awesome.

Every time I see something like this it reminds me that I'm more uptight than I actually need to be :)
$C: This level of CGI is good here because they know it's over the top and the film doesn't take itself seriously. The Avengers movies which are pretty much the same level of bullshit take themselves seriously and expect us to believe their shit is real.
$C: I'd watch that.
$C: 66k upvotes for a repost, not bad!
$C: God I laughed so hard i pee a little
$C: Looks better than half the drivel Hollywood spills out nowadays.
$C: Lol.I have something equally amazing 
https://imgur.com/a/ggwqB
$C: This looks like a real life anime
$C: Hmm I wonder if it works?.... time to get the old gang together again! 
$C: Why can't shit like this be in every movie?
$C: /r/BollywoodRealism 
$C: Wow...
$C: Wow what movie is that I'd like to see it 
$C: Honestly, better use of CG than a lot of modern Hollywood films.
$C: This is the link for part 1 trailer. 
https://youtu.be/sOEg_YZQsTI 
It’s really amazing movie.
$C: Seems like they get their best ideas from looney toons cartoons
$C: Indian films are like real life animes
$C: This ain't bollywood. It's from Tollywood. 
$C: This is better CGI than the edited-out mustache of Henry Cavill's in Justice League.
$C: I would rather chew off my toes than watch a CGI bloated blockbuster again(I cannot recall the plot of the last super hero movie I've watched) BUT I saw this in the theatre and multiple times after because it was just entertaining and has an emotional core even though its a standard good vs evil/son avenges father storyline. 
It might not be as slick as the regular hollywood blockbusters but I'll watch the shit out of it again!
:p

$C: Dude that was fucking lit
$C: Better cgi then Walking Dead. 
$C: It's Tollywood that did this movie, not Bollywood. Bollywood wishes.
$C: That was probably the most phenomenal thing I’ve ever seen. 
$C: They’ve made some questionable choices for season 8 of Game of Thrones, but I’ll be watching regardless. 
$C: This is actually the highest grossing Bollywood movie of all time if I'm not wrong :v
$C: It's not Bollywood technically.... But eh... Yeah sure... Too much work to explain it to you guys...
$C: Alright that’s actually pretty good now i wanna watch it.
$C: r/bollywoodrealisim also I watched this movie and it's so much fun. It's on Netflix in the us. I can't remember the name though. 
$C: This is actually the best thing ever.
$C: Has science gone to far?
$C: That's totally a good idea and wouldn't kill you guaranteed.
$C: I would incorporate this into a history lesson. It explains a lot.
$C: That’s actually a pretty fantastic scene

Admit I expected them to do some sort of shimi dance in mid air 
$C: /r/gifsthatendtoosoon 
$C: I don’t see how that could have gone wrong 
$C: This stunt might look stupid but at that moment in the theatre, it seemed fricking badass. 
$C: The skill, the acrobats to fly hundreds of feet in the air at an astounding skin burning speed not just to successfully penetrate the fortress but to land on their feet afterwords..... fantastic. 
$C: This is what happens when Wile E Coyote is your physhic professor.
$C: That's unpossible!
$C: Now I want to watch this movie.
$C: HEY ! I love that movie.
$C: Cool as fuck
$C: The matrix is child's play compared to this masterpiece.
$C: When my mom bring home Taco Bell:
$C: Whoever directed this should have made the hobbit movies 
$C: That is the sickest entrance I've ever seen.
$C: too much clash royale
$C: Okay I’m going to binge watch Bollywood movies now. Because this is the single greatest thing my eyes have ever witnessed!
$C: This is....

COMPLETELY BADASS!!! I need to watch more Bollywood.
$C: I wonder how many more times i will see this or the dancing dude gif from this movie.
$C: still more plausible than bending bullet by swinging your gun really fast.
$C: Just saying "it" is not a legitimate way of circumventing having to know the difference between "its" and "it's."
$C: My friend and I worked at a theater when this came out (the movie is Baahubali 2), and we live in a town with a high Indian Population, and Baahubali easily became our favorite movie to go in and do checks on for scenes like this. There’s a musical number that involves the titular Baahubali’s love interest doing stuff to a statue and what she does happens to Baahubali as well.

Do yourself a favor, it’s on Netflix, and just enjoy the ride

Other highlights include the final fight scene lasting 30 minutes and they go all god of war on each other, Baahubali and his son (also named Baahubali) are played by the same actor and look the exact same, it’s super fun.
$C: I don't know about you guys, but to me, this looks pretty well made o.o  

It's like the only unrealistic thing here is the stunt itself.
 


$C: This seems like something my players would try to do in my D&D games.
$C: That's not Bollywood. 
$C: If that older guy who cut the rope didn't get some sort of Bollywood Oscar or whatever as best supporting dude, ima be ticked!

$C: You know, most action movies are unbelievable. Got shot? Walk it off. Bomb? Not a problem. Wrecked a car? Not even a scratch.

This one is just like, "fuck it, let's make this awesome".  That dude landed like a badass ready to punch tickets to asskick-ville. 
$C: That’s pretty dope actually 
$C: It took me a second to realize that "Don't Rain On My Parade" was playing on my Spotify app and that this is a gif. The music started along with the gif and it was actually kinda funny...
$C: It's actually Tollywood and Kollywood.
$C: I mean... How fucking badass is that?
$C: Smh
$C: I'm here to talk to you about theAvengers initiative. 
$C: How'd he change his pants to red mid-flight?
$C: Most OVERRATED movie
$C: I take it Bollywood is supposed to be campy/silly?

(sorry I dont know much about Bollywood...)
$C: So are they supposed to be gods, demigods, super powered mortals or just some strange ridiculousness like Road Runner cartoons?
$C: All jokes aside, it is really cool to see Bollywood film special effects (and filming in general) coming up to par with western entertainment. 
$C: This is freakin beautiful
$C: This was posted months ago on /r/ClashRoyale with a much more pertinent message and it got maybe 1% the upvotes
$C: I mean yeah this is ridiculous but the production values of some of these ridiculous sequences have increased tenfold over the years!
$C: Ah yes... the Angry Birds Strategy from Bahubali 2
$C: This isnt Bollywood mate. Bollywood is for movies made in Bombay and this one isnt. But it is Indian cinema though.
$C: This scene ain’t even the best one. There’s scenes of him jumping mountains or the going to war with fire cows. This movie truly has some genius warcraftcy which seems real. Great movie with a great story as well. 
$C: I don't wanna nitpick but this isn't Bollywood, there are other film industries in India,  apart from the one in Mumbai.
$C: that was better cgi then i was expecting from bollywood
$C: It would be pretty cool but they can never seem to get physics right
$C: Some creative directors in Bollywood. 
Monty Python / Princes Bride type creativity. 
$C: I mean that was pretty dank 
$C: I didn't know Peter Jackson directed Bollywood movies.
$C: LOVE SEEING A THREAD ABOUT INDIAN CINEMA!
OP thanks for posting. 
$C: My dad calls this “Indian technology”
$C: Watching them stick the landing is oddly satisfying 
$C: This marks the point of human creativity. Future generations should take an example from this.
$C: I feel like i need more Bollywood in my life.
$C: Never change, Bollywood.  Stellar!
$C: this is my favorite 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4iDWXstrWY
$C: I thought they were gonna land and just start dancing. 
$C: Bc bahubali ka mazak???
$C: About as realistic as 300
$C: Still more believable than the last season of GoT
$C: r/trebuchetmemes fucking came to this.
$C: I will never understand why more movies with scenes like this dont exist in english movies?  Shit looked cool and while im sure there was dancing and singing it is Bollywood after all. Someone at least said "hey you know what breaches walls? Canons. What if our heroes became the cannon ball?" And made it work. Sure it looks silly but it alao looks Cool AF.
$C: Is this for real? What movie
$C: I love crazy Bollywood action sequences. They come up with some of the nuttiest stuff I’ve ever seen, and it is glorious. 
$C: I love how good the indian VFX industry has gotten, from Tunak Tunak Tun looking like a kid made it in Roblox to guys bouncing around on shields and it looking kind of believable.
$C: Baahubali 2 movie. To think the revenue from this movie was greater than the GDP of Pakistan. 😂
$C: I spent around 4 minutes for this 17 seconds to load but I can watch YouTube on 1080p without any hiccups in Vietnam... Good luck with net neutrality...
$C: That really was great.  With better graphics, etc. I could see that in a Hollywood flick. 
$C: Looks like your average d&d session.
$C: That is fucking awesome, I wonder if they all broke out into dance afterwards?
$C: I'd like Neil Degrasse Tyson to come and explain the physics to this 
$C: They used the Beverly Hills Ninja technique!
$C: This is Tollywood. Not Bollywood. But Indian cinema nonetheless and we like it. 🤷🏻‍♀️
$C: Just gotta say: this isn’t Bollywood. Bollywood is restricted to Hindi language cinema. Bollywood (Hindi), Tollywood (Tamil), etc. are various types of movie industries within India. Bahubali is from Tollywood. 
$C: Was this based on a true story?
$C: Oh man I am so glad to see Baahubali getting some recognition around here! LOVED the Telugu version. Been trying to find a good place to stream The Conclusion, but I can only ever find the Tamil, Hindi, Or Malayalam versions. Telugu version isn't on Netflix, it seems.

I found the movie to be extremely fun as long as you don't take it too seriously. The costumes and sets are absolutely gorgeous, and all the lovely ladies made me hella gay.
$C: I would totally watch this movie based on this GIF alone...
$C: Another fun fact: Bahubali 2 grossed $265 Million worldwide.

Dangal, on the other hand, made $310 Million just in China.

Dangal trailer: https://youtu.be/x_7YlGv9u1g
$C: when crush says :-

i am home alone come quick

these Bollywood guys take CGI to a whole other level lol 
$C: thats actually pretty dope, would watch/10
$C: They had a very shitty budget but still managed to make an awesome movie. 
$C: bollywood was a mistake.
$C: Wonder if it's on Netflix. Every other Bollywood movie is.
$C: We all know what the superior siege weapon is...
$C: Definitely watching this movie.... This is a type of move that should be in the next Avengers!
$C: We make fun of bollywood, have you ever watched Transformers?

Same shit.
$C: I'd watch the shit out of this movie...If I were at home, because I'm at work and quite honestly won't even bother to remember this.
$C: This shouldn't be in/funny but in /epic
$C: That was so lame but so cool at the same time somehow. 
$C: If only the Alliance can do this, then taking Lordaeron would be a breeze.
$C: Remember when everyone thought it was to much to have Legolas slide down some  stairs. Not in India they didn’t.
$C: Insanely creative.
$C: This must be the Big Mumma cheat from AOE but for India in the expansion 
$C: Give me nine good men and i'll impregnate the bitch ~Bron of Blackwater
$C: This movie is Indian Lord of the rings on super crack !!
Saw it in the theatres....wow!!
$C: How you deliver chicken curry to N. Korea.
$C: This was actually pretty amazing what's the film called? I need to watch it 
$C: I have to say I think that's the cleanest Bollywood graphics I've really seen (then again I'm American and not normally watching any of them unless they're gifs on Reddit)
$C: it's actually nicely done IMO

i could watch this movie and have a good time
$C: Watched this movie as a joke after seeing this gif and ended up loving it. It is called Baahubali 2.

You should see Bahubali 2 then see 1 since 2 is a prequel of sorts.


$C: I bet the dance scene in that movie is super epic.
$C: This new Aquaman movie looks dope.
$C: Not gonna lie, that was amazing. 
$C: That was hilarious
$C: The new lord of the rings movie looks interesting. 
$C: That was awesome.
$C: I don't want to crunch the numbers, but I'm pretty sure this is exactly what our understanding of physics shows would happen in this scenario.
$C: do a barrel roll
$C: I'm gunna be honest with you. I like the way bollywood merges cartoons with reality. Nobody wants to watch a hero in crisis and start thinking about his internal organs...
$C: I didnt like Billy Wood... Until now!!

Edit: Bollywood* (leaving in the typo because spell check made me laugh). 
$C: Thats actually awesome.
$C: Visually much more impressive and well excuted than some Hollywood movies nowadays.
$C: Would've been cooler if they rolled down that ramp in their shield ball
$C: That feels like it should be a mechanic in a video game.
$C: No wonder American corporations outsource IT to India. Those engineers are amazing. Great calculations on the trajectory with the catapult. 
$C: I’ve never seen a Bollywood film, but if this is what they do, then that will change ASAP. This is glorious! 
$C: Is it bad that i could totally see this happening in the new Hobbit movies?

Heck, it wouldn't be out of place in some of the new marvel movies.
$C: The film makers have made it freely available on Youtube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9770lB6E2M
$C: That was pretty awesome, thanks for the heads up on this movie.
$C: This movie is Baahubali 2: The Conclusion; it's been a while since I watched it so this might actually be Baahubali: The Beginning. Either way, great movies, so much fun. Fun fact, these two films are the highest grossing Bollywood movies ever. It's loved in both northern and southern India. 
$C: Holy shit that was goofy but cool af
$C: I was really hoping that when they landed they would start dance-swashbuckling.
$C: This is actually really brilliant. You see, when all 6 of them are in the air they go into a cylinder formation which in turns allows all of them to share the landing impact equally

This is a fine show a physics and honestly I am quite sad no other movies show this level of excellency 
$C: I really need to watch Bollywood films
$C: Fake
$C: That's actually fucking badass.
$C: FYI this movie grossed over $100 million.
$C: Just for clarity not bollywood. 
$C: This new power rangers movie looks great
$C: Doesn't look any less believable than Hong Kong style martial arts movies. In other words, fucking awesome 
$C: I want to see this!
$C: Bali Bali Bali Raa Bali
$C: You guys should try watching it, I loved the CG, pretty decent job for a story adapted from Indian history. Some scenes are over the top but overall good watch.
$C: That's Tollywood actually, South Indian movie industry. And the movie's name is Bahubali 2, very popular sequel to Bahubali.
$C: What, only Indians have done this when they were kids? You Westerners are too sheltered...
$C: **TUNAK TUNAK TUN INTENSIFIES**
$C: As silly as it is, that's pretty fuckin sweet!
$C: Thats not bollywood btw. Its tollywood, completely different film industry of the south.
$C: I don’t care that this defies all logic and physics it’s plain awesome and was well shot. 
$C: Omg that actually looked phenomenal 
$C: That's actually not too horrible. 
$C: Cheesy as fuck but those are incredibly well composed shots
$C: These movies are amazing. 
$C: It ended too soon, I'm invested now!
$C: No more ridiculous than Hollywood movies  
$C: whole movie was awesome and at this moment i realised its Bollywood anyways
$C: I know this might not been seen but this is on Netflix and in English (edit) subtitles. 
$C: beautiful
$C: That is pretty good for Bollywood film
$C: This technically isn't bollywood! 
$C: Hahaha...nice...added to my Netflix queue.  Actually looks decent and funny.
$C: That awesome! I wanna watch that.
$C: Baahubali wasnt Bollywood tho
$C: Saw this movie with my husband on Netflix. Super funny full of action and a little bit of sad moments. Love it! Thumbs up 👍🏼 
$C: its not bollywood btw
$C: It is tollywood btw, it is a telugu movie
$C: I always thought bollywood was dolly partons museum for her. I was wrong. 
$C: This can only happen in South Movie Industry Awesome this is
$C: THIS IS NOT BOLLYWOOD
$C: The Baahubali movies are pretty badass
$C: I live in India and I hate Bollywood movies
$C: That's Tollywood.Not Bollywood.
$C: God I love the baahubali movies
$C: Bollywood > Hollywood
$C: this isn't funny, this should be in r/awesome, you poop
$C: A tollywood movie not Bollywood. Difference is in the language. (Obviously) 
$C: Not Bollywood 
$C: Why India has not conquered the world's production of movies is beyond me.
$C: /r/r/BollywoodRealism
$C: I'm. Sooooo watching this tonight! 
$C: I love Bollywood!  Movies are great,  Lol but I need dubbed in English or subtitle....but have watched just for action!💗
$C: This movie is called Baahubali 2, and if you haven't seen it yet, you definitely should. It's one of those "so bad it's good" movies where it's so outrageous that it's sorta hilarious. I saw it with a huge group of friends and it was a great experience - we died laughing when this scene came on lmao
$C: Films name is Baahubali ,in case you where wondering. Also the film is not from Bollywood, its Tollywood(Telugu language film production)
$C: This the work of Director SS Rajamouli who took 5 years along with the lead actor Prabhas to finish the movie in 2 parts. Look them up on google. Rajamouli has some interesting movies.
$C: Bright, wide angle, steady cam.

This is how you do it Hollywood.
$C: Ahhh Bollywood, where pudgy, hairy, middle-aged men can still be the lead.  It's like Reddit fantasies leaked..
$C: Probably fake.
$C: I want to watch a Bollywood movie where the main characters are dark in complexion and not just the back up dancers. They always put fair actors in the front.
$C: By no means do I mean to ruin this party but its technically not Bollywood. 
$C: From this day forward, I will always trust brown men working with physics trajectory. 
$C: As a Indian I still didn't know why I'm forced to be impressed by this movie , nothing really special if your already exposed to shitty Hollywood CGI movies .
$C: Reddit is dead. How does a repost get 100k
$C: Well, no.

Baahubali 2 comes from [**TOLLYWOOD**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baahubali_2:_The_Conclusion#Production).
$C: Better than avengers I tell you, no shaky cams and over the top action scenes. 
$C: Tl;dr for the vast majority of the world, calling this Bollywood is fine. Too many languages in India to keep track of.

Movies are titled “Baahubali-The Beginning” and “Baahubali-The Conclusion” and are on youtube.

You need to watch part one first.
The movies were made really well (if you get past the Bollywood necessities of song and dance every 20 minutes or so.)

It's comparable to GoT or LoTR, and easily the least ridiculous action-fantasy-goodVsEvil Indian movie in probably ever. No expenses spared to do it well. If you've got 6 hours to burn, not a bad way to spend them.
$C: NO less implausable as all teh things that happen in american movies like jumping out of cars and brushing it off, or brushing off getting stabbed or shot.
$C: This isn't Bollywood. This is a Telugu movie
$C: But the movie is probably four hours long and has a dozen choreographed song and dance numbers about the youngest soldier and his secret female crush, longing for each other but kept apart by a series of profound misunderstandings and bad luck.
$C: i can't believe no one posted this but the Title song is sung by Daler Mehandi (tunak tunak tun guy). Listen for the [chills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-atPa3QUis)
$C: This is not Bollywood at its best. It's not even bollywood. 
Bollywood films are all made in English or Hindi. 
This movie, however, was made in the Telugu film industry which is one of the four regional film industries in south india. This is one of the most common mistakes committed by anyone of foreign descent who doesn't understand the Indian film production scenario. 
$C: But Kattappa ne Bahubali ko kyun mara?

$C: In a completely serious note, far far far more realistic than many Hollywood movies in which the cop or the soldier is killing an entire army by himself. Like the Rambo movies for example.
$C: This movie was actually REALLY good. Both parts one and two. 

It’s called Bahubali, and it’s everything Lord of the Rings type epics wish they could be. 
$C: That would not have looked out of place in Thor: Ragnarok.

And now I'm sad that at no point did we get to see Tom Hiddleston, Korg and Cate Blanchett perform a Bollywood song and dance routine.
$C: I fucking love Bollywood. In fact tbh these days i probably prefer Bollywood to Hollywood, because the films are so hilarious and bat shit crazy and awesome <3 
$C: I am pretty certain this is not Bollywood. Something else from India, but definitely not a Hindi movie. 
$C: Consider me old fashioned, but I like to be able to somewhat believe what I am watching.  This is why foreign films are typically so bad. 
$C: Lucky they didn't land in a designated shitting street.
$C: Ok this isn't Bollywood. This is tollywood. All indian cinema doesn't go by the name of bollywood, only Hindi (it's a language spoken by most of North India) films do. Tollywood is Telugu (another language spoken by two states in South India) cinema. This movie was dubbed into Hindi but it's very much a tollywood film. 
Bollywood movies are considered to be ridiculous, tollywood even more so
$C: Why does Bollywood movies have such ridiculous action scenes? 
$C: Not actually a Bollywood movie. It's a different industry entirely, known as Tollywood, which produces Tamil language movies.

It's called Baahubali, and it's actually a really good movie even ignoring the reality-defying stunts. Both parts are on Netflix. Go watch it.
$C: This ain't even Bollywood! It's a regional film. From Tollywood.
$C: FYI this was the top grossing movie in India. Yup that's what we like. Fuck your Avengers and Justice League bs. Unrealistic crap. 
$C: Bollywood is like rl anime.
$C: thats so fkn cool
$C: Greatest use of a shield wall ever.
$C: I think this is the perfect combination of the dumbest and coolest shit I have ever seen.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I'm pretty sure these movies are being written by 9 year olds and the indians just make it happen.
$C: At OP.. educate yourself on what is Bollywood and other movie industries of India.. This particular scene is from Baahubali 2nd part which is a Telugu movie from Tollywood!
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_cinema
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baahubali_2:_The_Conclusion
$C: fuk yeh
$C: That, was fucking smooth. Should have put something like that in a LOTR movie.
$C: That was a badass landing
$C: This actually happened
$C: And here I thought it was all unnecessary zooms. There wasn't a single unnecessary zoom there.
$C: oh man thats good
$C: Stumbled upon this movie on Netflix, probably the greatest movie of all time
$C: Bollywood defies gravity once again
$C: the dude cutting the cord looked white. 
$C: That's how I was born 
$C: GoT meets Star Wars?
$C: Yes. Seems plausible. Should’ve been a trebuchet though.
$C: I need to watch more Bollywood
$C: holy shit thats sick
$C: Now they just get shot at by thousands of arrows.
$C: I'm so high and that was fucking awesome. 
$C: I really need to start watching Bollywood movies apparently 
$C: I wish I could see both of these movies for the first te again
$C: That's actually badass 
  
All bollywood I've seen in the past was just essentially musicals! Are there more action movies now?
$C: i bet they bust out a sick song right after too.
$C: They should sign up for the justice league 
$C: Haha, reminds me of when the A-team "flew" a tank in one of the movies. Or maybe it was RED.
$C: Why doesn't modern military have something similar to this?
$C: Class 
$C: [removed]
$C: Hell. It looks better than the CGI web slinging in any of the like 8 or 9 spiderman movies to date.
$C: No trebuchet jokes yet?
Reddit, I'm disappointed
$C: There is an entire, incredible, world of cinema that I am missing out on
$C: The movie is *Baahubali.*  It's a two-part movie, and it's actually really good and entertaining.  It's on Netflix. :)
$C: Bollywood is like a copy of me when I was 5, when I had an insane imagination. Today I'm excited if I can imagine what was in my fridge. 
$C: Yo as wonky and funny as this is, it's honestly cool as hell. I'd watch movies like this all day.
$C: The action-scenes were a bit bad but this is probably the best Bollywood movie ever.

$C: Gimme six good men and a tree....I'll impregnate the bitch.
$C: You think that shits impressive?

You should see their [cavalry](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/rKpxP)
$C: Very month pythonesque even though it uses special effects. Pretty creative and pretty goofy
$C: Do a barrel roll!
$C: This is beautiful.
Quite possibly the most accurate portrayal of ancient siege tactics I've ever seen
$C: Ajit's Squad fighting FCC
$C: Oh new update for fortnite looks good af
$C: Just came to say I saw both these movies and they were fucking amazing.  If you havn't watched them you probably should!  
$C: This genuinely made me laugh out loud 
$C: Baron Muchausen rides again 
$C: What the fuck just happened!
$C: Oh fuck off. Get the fuck out of here with that shit. Lol. Serious? Lol. 

That was pretty cool thou.
$C: Yep. Ok. 
$C: This is Bahubali 2. I recommend this movie to watch while you're really stoned 
$C: Should I be proud that a Bollywood gif is in top of reddit or something else 
$C: Thats coooool
$C: I'm amazed that old dude didn't break his hip. He can barely lift that sword! 
$C: Please no more graphic violence on r/funny
$C: I think im gonna watch this before going to the gym from now on

$C: Reminds me of when Legolas gets on that horse in a really awkward way. 
$C: Is this historically accurate? 
$C: Yippee kah yah Mata fuker ...come again
$C: Would you believe me if I told you this is the second highest grossing bollywood movie ever? Right.
$C: i would pai to watch this!
$C: QUICK BILAL FIRE THE MISSILE, OUR PEOPLE NEED US
$C: What film is it
$C: A catapult? If they had used a trebuchet it would be 10000 times cooler
$C: Actually I was expecting something like this for the Hobbit. 
$C: I wouldn't mind watching an outrageous action packed comedy movie every now and then.
$C: this is the best movie in Bollywood Industry.. 
$C: Hahaha
$C: They should all drink a beer before hand
$C: Fuck physics... who gives a shit.
$C: Why doesn't America make movies like this from time to time I mean we had shoot em up but that's about it
$C: None of the archers on the wall even look up...like they don't even notice
$C: That's not bad. THat's pretty awesome!
$C: Holy cow, that's amazing!
$C: Ok. I hate to read subtitles but this may get me to stretch my 3rd grade reading skills for pure joy.
$C: Is this a comedy or are they actually trying to be badass and cool?

They have to know that's silly right?

Like how we have sharknado
$C: Monty Python and the Holy Grail crossed with any kung fu exploitation movie.
$C: *Tollywood. This is a Telugu movie. Bollywood makes Hindi movies. 
$C: CGI can’t even make that happen 
$C:  Based on a true story
$C: Tom Cruise also does all his own stunts
$C: A good watch though, a perfect 5/7, would recommend. 
$C: This movie was pretty good. I watched it on Netflix like a month ago 
$C: Looks doable, hey Jimmy call the whole gang. We're going to Canada
$C: Angry birds movie made in India
$C: Bollywood's not that different but that's not Bollywood.
$C: I low key loved that. A blend of Chinese wirework and anime style theatrics. 
$C: I'd love bollywood movie if they didn't gave all the singing and dancing. Some of the movies look really interesting and have some really cool cinematography, but i can't stand the music.
$C: But how many babies did he make? 
$C: If you can read this 1 love and may you prosper always! 
$C: Idk why we make this crap. 
$C: I just want to know how they reversed their rotation mid-flight. 
$C: The landing after breaking apart was awesome
$C: I’m from India and I’m not going to defend it.
But then, even wolverine and others are not logical, simply a product of thought.
$C: Say what you will, but Bollywood Special effects have come light years in about 3 years. It's pretty cool.
$C: In case anyone wants to see the scene right before and to until after this clip https://youtu.be/H9770lB6E2M
$C: This shits pretty believable compared to what they usually pump out. 
$C: I love how they didn't even need to bring a catapult for this attack
$C: I wish these were english dub, they look really cool.
$C: [Link to the scene](https://youtu.be/H9770lB6E2M?t=2h22m42s)
$C: Those FX were better than expected!
$C: The Bollywood Bullet Time. 
$C: I want to watch this...
$C: That is hilariously creative.
$C: Somehow this was perfectly ridiculous. Normally Bollywood stuff for me is just ridiculous but this was quality insanity. 
$C: better than hollywood
$C: Can we just have Bollywood do live action anime movies? They seem like they could get it right.
$C: Tollywood, not Bollywood. Still, Indian cinema at it's best!
$C: Baahubahli 2 is the movie in question. I watched it with my relatives, and it's really good if you forgive the visual FX fidelity of the movie. I watched it in telegu, which is the standard language it's in, and it's pretty good.
$C: Technically this is not Bollywood, it's a Tamil movie - but one the did incredibly well domestically and overseas.
$C: *Tollywood
$C: Wew a post of indian origin on the frontpage of reddit! Feel the wrath of 1.3 billion souls, reddit!
$C: I thought robot was...again telugu or maybe tamil
$C: We also have one movie in which a person's brain transplantation is done and he can read the memories of the person whose brain is attached to him, which is used to identify the killer of person whose brain it was. 
$C: Would have been more entertaining if they watched an in-flight film while they were in mid-air.
$C: This is cool as hell.
$C: Impressive... I honestly didn’t know they had stuff like this.  It looks nearly watchable
$C: From Bahupaali 2, physics don't make sense in this movie although it is one of the most popular southern Asian movies this year after Mersal
$C: Seriously.. This just made my day! 🤣🤣
$C: This is the best thing I've ever seen. 
$C: We need Jamie and Adam to test this out.  Seriously. 
$C: Most Hollywood movies are more like cartoons now with all the CGI.  Look at original Jurassic Park compared to trailer of upcoming one.  Original looked more realistic in 1993 due to mixing affects with animatronics. 
$C: Link taught us long ago that [shields are great for travel in battle.](https://media.giphy.com/media/qgGEJb8WajfLq/giphy.gif)
$C: This is tollywood, not Bollywood 
$C: This is Tollywood. Not Bollywood. 
$C: That was one of the most well done Bollywood effects I've seen actually.  

bolly good job!
$C: Movie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5FvgdI6h-c
$C: When they were flying through the air it totally looked like the docking scene from interstellar 
$C: I knew if I searched long enough I would find evidence of time travel. Anyone know what year they traveled back to to film this? 
$C: Reminds me of Angry Bird game.
$C:  so much effort for something so stupid.
$C: What movie is this pls 
$C: Nothing compared to the dancing superman one.
$C: Wow the new Star Wars looks really good
$C: You guys should watch [this](https://youtu.be/TU5BL5Dj-q8?t=681).
$C: Luke should have done something similar in " The Last Jedi"
$C: I'm still partial to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsRgtaS70WA&t=29s) as the best bollywood scene ever.
$C: You can just feel the physics break when they hit the ground.
$C: Fuck trebuchets, *this* is the superior siege engine.
$C: What would happen realistically? Dumb question I know but just wondering.
$C: I'm too high to follow. 
$C: My roommate and I just watched this on netflix it was the craziest 4 hour movie we've ever watched. Baahubali 2: The Conclusion
$C: They seem to be inspired by Angry Birds
$C: Not gonna lie. I saw these movies in theater. Not from India either.
$C: was EZ gg
$C: Took long enough to blow up here, I knew this would eventually wind up on reddit
$C: I remember watching this and dying with laughter. 
$C: Technically, that is Tollywood...
$C: Considering the enormous hype this movie had, I'm surprised that OP failed at the one job they had when posting this. 

This is NOT Bollywood. It's from a Telugu industry - we call it Tollywood. Most of the super-epic action sequences all ya'll western folk like tends to not be bollywood. 

Why do people get butthurt when you call it Bollywood? Because Bollywood is like the Jersey Shore of our film industry - and other industries are like deranged LSD-fuelled dreams powered by methamphetamine. 

LSD-Meth combo makes for far better viewing than the Hindi Jersey Shore.
$C: ok,let me try that.

hold my beer.
$C: Not enough brown leather jackets. 
$C: It's so funny 
$C: Bollywood is starting to look like some Indians turning their DnD games into movies. 
$C: It's tollywood😂
$C: The movie is Baahubali. It’s on Netflix. I know what I’m doing this weekend.
$C: Quick guys, someone post another gif of the mustache dude that kills men using a banana
$C: It’s a kollywood movie that’s made in every language in India 
$C: 'The Hobbit' was filled with scenes like this.
$C: watched this while What's My Age Again was on
10/10 highly recommended
$C: I bet they call this the "Barrel" formation.....
$C: I am now thinking I should try this at home.  I'm feeling pretty confident.
$C: I never can tell if these clips are legitimate action movies or like an action-comedy type like King Fu Hustle.
$C: Is this Peter Jackson's version of the Silmarillion? 
$C: its art 
$C: Yo I would love to smoke up and watch this. Can anyone tell me the name of this movie?!
$C: Yeah well this isn't a Bollywood movie. It's a telugu movie, although still Indian. 
$C: This is the second part of the movie Bahubali and it is actually a Tollywood movie. As i understand it, Bollywood movies are from the northern region  of India where they speak Hindu, and Tollywood movies are from the southern region known as Telugu where they speak Tamil.

Bollywood is known for the more famous actor, romance stories, and the movie is structured as action scene-dance number-action scene - repeat.

Tollywood movies are different in that they are 90% batshit action and 10% dance. The protagonist is usually a middle aged guy wtih an awesome moustache or beard. And most importantly the complete lack of physics. I could watch Tollywood movies all day. 
$C: The Myrmidons have absolutely nothing against these guys.
$C: That's from Baahubali 2: The Conclusion
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4849438/?ref_=nv_sr_2

$C: Haters will say its fake
$C: Better than the Kardashians
$C: They vfx team did pretty well up until the guys separated.  Then the spinning just looked stupidly unnatural.
$C: i don't know man, they are not singing. it's just not as good
$C: Well I must say more entertaining than a lot of Hollywood crap. If I enjoy legolas trowing a drawf in the center of armed orcs I am definitely enjoying this
$C: Wont lie that was nice
$C: I don't get it, when they land, one of them has red pants. Its not one of the archers because he wields a sword and shield, but from the animation it looks to be one of the archers..., plus the red pants. Anyone else noticed this?
$C: Never gets old
$C: Physics Shmisics
$C: [My favorite Indian cinematic masterpiece.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUYa5aTdjfI)
$C: It's a south Indian film ; not Bollywood.
$C: If only the white walkers saw this
$C: the Looney Toons have nothing on these guys.
$C: The *finest* piece of shit.
$C: This actually happened at the beginning of the moguls empire,pretty interesting.
$C: This is Tollywood, not Bollywood.  I say that not be a smart a**, but only because the CGI in the Bahubali movies is light years better than anything Bollywood has ever done
$C: Every time I see shit like this, I always imagine the actor looking at the producer and being like,

>You want me to pretend like I’m doing *what?*

>>Uhh, yeah, just like do some spins and shit on the spot and then we’re going to use some shitty CGI to make it look like you just got shot out of a catapult and then landed 1300 yards away and stuck a cool pose

>>>...
$C: r/Bollywoodrealism
$C: This is fake.
$C: omg that landing was crazy....
$C: This Movie is second part of the Bahubali Franchise 
Here is the Rotten Tomatoes section on it
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/baahubali_2_the_conclusion/

Rotten Tomatoes section on first Movie
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/baahubali_the_beginning/reviews/

Netflix Acquired the Rights for both the Parts and is availaible Worldwide. Movie was blazingly succesfully domestically as well as Internationally acquiring about 141 Million Dollars which is a lot for Indian Cinema
http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=baahubali2.htm
$C: NGL that was fucking awesome. What's this from?
$C: The Modi government in nutshell. 
$C: Maybe the Could have penetrated deeper with a trebuchet...
$C: I fucking love Bollywood.
$C: You haven't seen anything yet lol.

Have you seen the Jeep jumping over a trailer whilst the horse slides under 
$C: Okay, that was boss
$C: If you haven’t seen bahubali and like fantasy and lore, check it out. its on Netflix. Both of the movies are epic. 
$C: /r/CartoonPhysics 
$C: Hollywood is crap coming up with ideas but movies around the world are really awesome 
$C: You laugh, but I'd watch that.

And if this was Marvel, you wpupdn't bat an eye.
$C: For being so good at engineering and math, the physics on this is all wrong. 
$C: You know what would have really sold it? A costume change.
$C: Is this even possible?
$C: As someone with a PhD in engineering, I approve. 
$C: 👣
$C: Did anybody else think they'd go down the ramp as a wheel?
$C: that actually... not bad at all o_O weird sure bur not bad
$C: i swear give the director of this a super hero movie. that was one of the most badass super hero landings ever
$C: Actually pretty well done despite it being totally bizarre 
$C: I've seen worse CGI. That was surprisingly decent. 
$C: And this is the 2nd highest grossing movie ever made in India
$C: Those trajectory calculations were spot on. 
$C: I love that feeling when I click on a GIF and it takes a second to start up so I've already forgot what the title was and uhh wait WHAT
$C: Not much different than Hollywood ... the difference is mostly production budget
$C: Still better than new star wars' movies
$C: Kattappa missile😀😀
$C: The name of the movie is Bahubali. It's a 2 part movie. And it's not from Bollywood but Tollywood. The Telugu movie industry
$C: Lol what the fuck
$C: Looks dangerous, hope that no stunt men were hurt making this
$C: Idk that was pretty cool despite how unrealistic it was.
$C: Gravity is weaker in india.
$C: So these two movies are on Netflix, and they were actually pretty fucking good. Cheesey acting but awesome story
$C: That’s actually pretty legit. 
$C: Btw, it’s not Bollywood, Bollywood is typically referred to the Hindi film industry 
$C: u/ThatPackOTW geeking 
$C: I went to watch this movie with my friend. It was a genuine Indian crowd, rowdy as they come. And we were the only two laughing our asses off at this scene, it was glorious. 
$C: Some of the stuff is pretty fantastic, but after every cool move I am bracing myself for some moment where everyone smiles, opens their eyes really big, extend their fingers out flat and shakes their tushy to some kind a weird music for few minutes. Then they remember how much they hate each other and fight again 
$C: Reminds me of Inside Out when Joy used Riley's crush clones to catapult her to the headquarters. 
$C: Does it work though?
$C: Would have liked an ‘aim for the bushes’ end to this 🤜🏽🤛🏽
$C: The archers don't even turn around 
$C: What are some important films to watch when you wanna get into the genre?
$C: Why do they have red pants when they land?
$C: Tollywood/Kollywood....but not Bollywood hehe
$C: I imagine that is just how it happened.
$C: still makes more sense than the last jedi
$C: Fun fact, Indian cinema is the largest film industry in the world.
$C: Good job

$C: Was Stephen Chow behind this?
$C: Fun fact: this movie made $350 million globally. They made more money in China than guardians of the galaxy 

This means globally, this movie made more money than 95% of all Hollywood movies released this year 
$C: ohhhh i like it (never seen a bollywood film)

$C: I want more!
$C: Better than most of TLJ...
$C: This looks fucking awesome. 
$C: what....?? it may happens.
$C: You mean Tollywood?
$C: This movie is actually quite good to watch. I think it was one of India’s best ever films. Even as an American it’s a good watch. 
$C: China loves this kind of nonsense
$C: This is why I like Bollywood , I mean it’s fiction anyway so just go full fiction :)
$C: Who does come up with these ideas?
$C: That is fucking awesome!!!
$C: That's Bollywood?
$C: Amazing
$C: This isn’t Bollywood
$C: I'd watch the shit out of this movie.
$C: Crap, I only have Star Wars tickets and I really want to see this!
$C: That's some "Wickie the Viking" shit.. 
$C: Angry Birds: Madras edition 
$C: For all those who are thinking it's a Bollywood film, no its not Bollywood, its a tollywood(Telugu language) film
$C: Not gonna lie. Stupid but cool. And if I've learned anything in life, it's: if it looks cool, it ain't stupid.
$C: Now that’s BADASS 
$C: That CGI is pretty good. I'm sold
$C: Movie/where to buy it subbed?
$C: This is literally a scene from Ender's Game - the novel! Ender's final game at the academy and the actual end battle. 
$C: Lol, that's brilliant, I was expecting them to cartwheel around a bit though with those shields, instead of breaking apart on impact, I feel like that would've been even better.
$C: not gonna lie, I was never into bollywood but this is comically amazing and amazing production value. would watch.
$C: rome total war wishes they had this shit
$C: That was literally path-breaking formation flying tech.
$C: This is beautiful
$C: damn those effects arent half bad
$C: Thats actually pretty bad ass
$C: If you think this is ridiculous you should try watching swahiliwood...
$C: Everything about this is so wrong, yet so right!
$C: Looks like the Goblin Barrel from Clash Royale
$C: At first I thought that they would remain in formation when they land and do some bowling.
$C: The goblin barrel is my favourite card
$C: That's funny yet badass...we need a new word to describe this!!
$C: What the fuck is this?
$C: [Source Vid](https://youtu.be/H9770lB6E2M?t=2h22m34s)
$C: That movie is highest revenue grossing Indian movie ever in the history 
$C: 😂
$C: Wow
$C: Ah, finally, the Knights of Ren
$C: the mighty BAAHUBALI!
$C: I’d rather watch this over every single movie starring Adam sandler
$C: Still better than Super Leia
$C: even though the action scenes in this movie aren't realistic, this movie is a huge step forward for indian cinema. this movie was something new, with some very grand scenes. more importantly it was a huge relief from the boring and soapy love stories bollywood rolls churns out every month. movies like bahubaali, 3 idiots, chak de india, are proof that we can get better, but we don't because these shitty movies earn money. if you guys want an example of what I'm talking about then go watch a few scenes of "bang bang" starring hrithik roshan on youtube. I'm assuming most of you have watched knight and day? bang bang was a complete copy paste of ever single scene. most bollywood movies are
$C: She does actually, although not fluent. She speaks Gujarati, Hindi, Telegu and some Urdu. She just doesn't enjoy Tollywood movies as much as Bollywood. 
$C: Okay but lowkey i'm somewhat impressed by this.
$C: I remember watching this in theater, sound effects made it look badass
$C: Physics, why do we need it?
$C: Buh-dass
$C: [U would say " u know what, that could be possible" after watching this epic shot from another bollywood movie. Reality. What ever is that doing in a movie ](https://i.imgur.com/hLBJRbO.jpg)
$C: It’s Tollywood actually but both parts are really fun.
-First one is Bahubali and
-Second one is Bahubali: The Conclusion
$C: Most overrated movie of all time
$C: This ruined the movie for me. The rest of it was actually good. 
$C: Is it just me, or has Bollywood's production quality improved massively in the last decade or so? 
$C: Saw this movie in the theater, was not disappointed
$C: This is not Bollywood, nevertheless it's still fine as an old wine. This is an instance from the Telugu movie Bahubaali 2.
$C: That is actually impressive. Not even a bit more fake than car jumps in american movies.
$C: It’s actually an awesome movie - Indian version of a combo of Superman / matrix etc. 

More from the movie - obviously what’s an Indian movie without a musical number: https://youtu.be/vlkNcHDFnGA
$C: Its Tollywood not Bollywood and you will find most Tollywood movies funny specially the ones by Rajnikanth.
$C: r/trebutchetmemes
$C: that actually looked pretty good!
$C: Which film is it? Looks worth a download.
$C: This isn't Bollywood, it's Tollywood.
$C: That was cool as shit. I hear the actors do their own stunts too.
$C: I can't wait for India to become an economic powerhouse on the level of China and America so that we can see these movies stateside.
$C: This is actually a fantastic film.
$C: I mean, you can't tell me that's not cool!

..well, obviously, you could. But I mean to say that you'd be wrong.
$C: That was pretty cool.
$C: Jezus i want to watch this movie now
$C: This is Tollywood, not Bollywood, by the way.
$C: If this was Marvel and it was a comic book team who were enhanced using a rare locally sourced medicinal herb and highly trained in shield based infiltration... it would still be goofy as hell.
$C: But at first they're pants are green and then they're red...
$C: Is this Bahubali? 

This is Bahubali. 

I've never seen this damn movie yet I recognize its gifs *everywhere*. Why is it everywhere, is it any good? Has anyone seen this film? 
$C: This is Tollywood 
$C: Subreddit for these gifs?
$C: [deleted]
$C: F@#k, yeah!
$C: r/ClashRoyale would’ve seen this before.

But then again, I doubt that r/ClashRoyale browse r/funny anyway
$C: It's not even bollywood.:3
$C: It's the closest to power rangers they could do 
$C: That was totally wicked!


$C: Epic!
$C: I want this as a FB cover photo so bad. Someone please make this 4mb from 70mb haha
$C: Holy shit i am impressed!
$C: This is amazing. 
$C: Tollywood.
$C: It's not bollywood fyi
$C: Ok, sure. If you say so physics, if you say so...
$C: the fuck... 
$C: It's just like my Japanese anime
$C: FYI not every Indian movie is "Bollywood"



*shakes head *
$C: Next order of business: we sling shot to moon with tyre formation
$C: Shit that was awesome
$C: I'm surprised they weren't singing and it didn't end in a dance number...
$C: "Personality Crisis." - New York Dolls.  Hollywood has one.  Import these.  Run 'em in our Western Cinemas alongside their inferior counterparts.
$C: The most majestic landing of 2017
$C: Goblin barrel
$C: While we all take these as jokes, we somehow treat superhero movies differently
$C: THIS ISN'T SPARTA!
$C: thats sick!
mixture of HOBBIT & spartans? lol
$C: i've seen like 3 pretty cool clips of bollywood films on reddit and they were all musicals. are most bollywood films musicals?
$C: kakaaaaa
$C: FORM TESTUDO
$C: Put The Film Director in jail.
$C: How is this any different than the avengers?
$C: Hmmm...possible.
$C: Why is this stuck at the top of my newsfeed? 
$C: This is not a Bollywood movie. It’s a Telugu movie
$C: You know he's the real shit, when he's not wearing his helmet in a siege.
$C: India: 1
Physics: 0
$C: That not fucking bollywood. Reddit get your shit together. 
$C: Lol what is this shit I wanna know the plot of the movie now 
$C: So Tough to record such kind of scenes 
$C: Defying logic, physics and human capacity!
$C: So Tough to Record such kind of scenes 
$C: What the movie?
$C: TIL Bollywood is just live action anime
$C: That's actually hilariously heros 
Awesome actors 
$C: lot of proud indian over here
$C: Just who do they think we are that makes them confident that we'd let them get away with that?
$C: I just waited for the dancing 
$C: Well then.  Kind of cool
$C: Reminds me of Wile E. Coyote and his antics. 
$C: You 
$C: Available in US Netflix 
$C: What the...? xD
$C: Still more realistic than Fast and Furious 45.
$C: That's Tollywood
$C: Actually the vfx are pretty nice
$C: I wish life was that simple. 
$C: What's Bollywood
$C: Its cartoony nature reminds me of wes anderson.
$C: This is Baahubali , a Tollywood production. The movie is meh , but has the best VFX any Indian movie has ever had. It is in two parts , and was produced at a budget that it pretty high for Tollywood (or any Indian cinema , for that matter).
$C: Dude looks like Adrian Pimiento from Brooklyn 99 :D
$C: I want a video game based on the Bollywood universe
$C: Aerial testudo.
$C: Wait till you guys find the blanket-wrap-the-enemy strategy from this film. Reddit will break.
$C: Team rocket we are blasting off to space!
$C: That was kick-ass movie 

$C: Completely historical reenactment, can't you tell?! damn. 
$C: This is not bollywood
$C: But when iron man's friend fall from a kilometer high (Ultron age) and survive no one bats an eye.
$C: Bollywood, the very definition of "suspension of disbelief"
$C: What the fuck
$C: Amazing.
$C: RIP Katappa :'(
$C: Sick af
$C: This just reminded me of "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen" from the 1980's. 
$C: Certainly upping their CGI game, looks almost seamless.
$C: Bet there are imdb reviews saying "1/10 TOTALLY UNREALISTIC TERRIBLE CGI INSTEAD OF ACTUAL STUNTS."
$C: God, I wish I could get the Mythbusters on this. 
$C: Now that's what I'm talking about!
$C: That was amazing. 

*stands and claps*
$C: What movie is this? I must know!

$C: Looks damn affective
$C: Reminds me of an Asterix & Obelix movie.
$C: You know this isn't THAT different from Charlies Angels
$C: Love this documentary!
$C: is it just me or is this the sickest shit ever
$C: Bollywood is so fucking metal.
$C: Group superhero landings
- Deadpool
$C: I am convinced that the dude who cut the rope is Jeor Mormont before being sent to the wall.
$C: Seems plausible 
$C: Still better than most of Hollywoods special effects.

And it was damn cool too
$C: r/gamephysics
$C: Still better CGI than Wonder Woman 
$C: Welp... I am clearly not watching nearly enough bollywood films
$C: Wheres the dance sequence?
$C: Fuck me, they cleared it! 
$C: [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9JMo9xLfzM) has always been my favorite Bollywood thing
$C: This is basically our "superhero" movie 
$C: That was cooler than the other side of the pillowwwwwww
-banks
$C: Team rocket blasting off again!
$C: Bleach: Live action movie. Set in medieval India.

$C: I love these over-the-top scenes from these kind of movies.


$C: [Still more believable than this.](http://handbeezy.com/6ceHJ0jJC/)
$C: Better CGI than the hobbit
$C: Glorious 
$C: I love how there's half a second after the rope is cut where the tree just doesn't move.
$C: It’s a racist community! 
$C: I remember when I first pulled off the fly spin shield attack. 
$C: Just a quick/serious quesh, is this supposed to be funny or cool in india??? 😂
$C: Just realized I play D & D like a Bollywood movie.

No wonder my friends hate me.
$C: What is this and how can i make it part of me
$C: Goblin barrel!
$C: This is amazing. 
$C: Physics in Bollywood Movies are amazing 
$C: I must watch this
$C: I would like to watch this movie. Does anybody have a title?
$C: It's so dense.
$C: Who do they think they are, the Fast and the Furious?
$C: Ahhh, that was pretty awesome!!!
$C: it's not bollywood.. its a telgu film
$C: This is a really amazing teamwork even as a generated.
$C: A trebuchet would have made this wholesomely more believable. 
$C: Was really hoping they would keep formation, roll down that ramp and just plow through everyone..
$C: That is some Terry Gilliam level shit right there
$C: It's south Indian movie actually not Bollywood 
$C: So... it's clear. If they ever make a good D&D movie, it's gonna come from Bollywood.
$C: Thought they were going to start dancing on that tree. 
$C: What did I just watch. 
$C: this is awsome!
$C: They should create a new genre: Synchronised combat epics. 
$C: Yeah, right.
$C: the other guy that lands straight next to him is one of the baddies, note orange pants
$C: it seems They lost a lot of good men that day
$C: Can we get this siege mechanic added to shadow of wars sieges?
$C: It's not even Bollywood 😑
$C: This is Not Bollywood 
$C: I’d watch this.
$C: r/Bollywoodphysics
$C: I honestly thought they were about to burst into song when I saw them grabbing arms
$C: Just curious.. How was Bollywood conceived? China doesn't even try to create its own version of Hollywood why do they try so hard?
$C: I believe this over Indy surving a nuke in a fridge
$C: solve this riddle
Sally, Lisa, and Bernadette are triplets. But Sally and Lisa share something that Berandette does not. What is it?...
....
......
....
....
.....
The letter 'L' in their names.

$C: Looks like they're breaking into Soul Society in bleach 
$C: 2, 3, 5, 9, 17, _ What is the next number in the sequence?
$C: That is pretty good for Bollywood film
$C: I ain’t mad at it 
$C: This has Michael Bay written all over it
$C: 10 out of 10 landing.
$C: That is some Stephen Chow shit!
$C: Just an FYI, for people who *dislike* this about Indian cinema and would prefer more gritty realism, you should check out Nigerian "Nollywood" cinema.

As India produces most of films watched in South Asia, Nigeria is the centre of movie-making in Africa. It's still relatively in its infancy but it's got its own unique vibe and aesthetic.
$C: It gave me mini-heart attack
$C: Indian people definitely have the concept of badass down.
$C: Shit, that could have come straight out of a Lord of the Rings fight scene. 
$C: Sorry to be the party pooper, but not all Indian movies are classified as Bollywood movies. 
$C: I can’t stop watching this... 
$C: I can confirm this is how that day went
$C: I don't think I could ever take indians seriously... there's just something there that's funny
$C: /r/bollywoodrealism
$C: is the guy who cuts the rope Jorah Mormonts dad?

$C: Goblin barrel lvl 13 ffs
$C: ... and that is how Angry Birds came to be ...
$C: As Derpy as that was, it fucking stuck that landing. 9/10 would watch
$C: The special effect and post production effect were really good
$C: what movie is this i have to watch it XD 
$C:   Bbbbn          
$C: Impressive
$C: That’s actually badass. 
$C: They bounced! .. and 1 or 2 unlucky ones look to have bounced the wrong way!
$C: Game of Thrones would be 1000x cooler if the Unsullied employed this tactic to take Kings Landing.
$C: "at it finest"???

at its* finest.


$C: Yet the archers don't do anything. r/gifsthatendtoosoon
$C: There is nothing fine about Bollywood.
$C: Isn’t this technically Tollywood? 
$C: Man, their SFX are getting better and better and it's just gettin cooler and cooler. 
$C: Bahubali is fuckin awesome!
$C: I really can't understand these Bollywood movies. Is this a children's movie? Are they all children's movies?
$C: Bollywood > Hollywood 
$C: Stuck the landing doe
$C: Bollywood is what live action anime aspires to be.
$C: Seriously, this sequence should have ended in a dance number. All of them landing like that is just too good of an opportunity to miss by *not* breaking out into a dance number. 
$C: This is awesome
$C: lol! Have to watch this movie 
$C: Why use a giant wooden horse, when you can just fling Santa Clause and five other guys over the wall?
$C: Apparently we've been wasting our cgi here in america
$C: Wow, what happened to the budget in game of thrones!
$C: /r/Bollywoodrealism
$C: THAT WAS AWESOME!
$C: felt like it’s possible 🤔🤔
$C: this is really cool, what movie is this? 
$C: Baahubaliiiiiiiiiiii!
I have yet to watch part 2
$C: Historical accuracy? Check.
$C: Is Bollywood comparable with telenovelas?
$C: That was beautiful
$C: explains why Alexander didn't conquer India
$C: Wanda! Just like we practiced.
$C: Game of Thrones Season 8 looks fucking sweet. 
$C: That guy should really be wearing a helmet
$C: production quality is going up!
$C: Holy whiskers

$C: I love how smooth it is. They make it look like it's really possible.
$C: I love how the whole of Bollywood doesn't seen to have read a single page about editing theory.
$C: Totally would watch this.
$C: Asterix in Bollywood

I like it :)
$C: r/accidentalDND
$C: Pai was inspired by this to do crazy things.
$C: That's actually amazing..

$C: Yep, I'd watch that. 
$C: That was fuckin sweet, even by Hollywood standards. Bunch of medieval Indian John wicks.
$C: My history teacher showed us this clip in class a month or so ago. Pretty good shit.
$C: That was so fucking slick tho
$C: Yeah but why tho.I´ve seen less ridiculus shit in anime xD.
$C: r/moviephysics
$C: Why isn't this the top post at /r/BollywoodRealism/ ?
$C: Jaaaaaai Mahishmathiiiiiiii
$C: Isn't it easier with flying carpets?
$C: I've actually seen this movie. And I think they know they're over doing it but that ridiculousness just seems to be part of what makes it... authentically ambitious?(I wish i had a better vocabulary) . Like a kid's imagination. 
$C: Lmao that is the greatest thing I've ever seen on Reddit by far.
$C: There are shit ton of these scenes in bahubali part 1 and 2. Whole movie can be a gif 
$C: This would be so much fun to do if I was indestructible
$C: See, I could watch a new superhero movie every other month if this kind of plot and production value were present.
$C: not gonna lie that was fucking badass 
$C: This is so damn believable. Lol 
$C: I was so happy when I saw this on the front page. Until I saw the sub.
$C: bahubali is full of shit like this! mental in a good way
$C: That could work.  Just avoid using supplies from the ACME company.  
$C: That’s actually pretty cool idea. 
$C: Gotta love Rule of Cool. I want to see this whole thing.
$C: This movie collected US$265 million and it’s Tollywood 
$C: FYI:  This is not from Bollywood . This clip is from Movie in Telugu Film Industry
$C: Not Bollywood..  It's TollyWood 
$C: Wow
$C: Is Bollywood actually /r/anime_irl for movies ?
$C: That’s the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen.
$C: sickkkkkkkkk
$C: This is so impossible, that sword was made of rubber and wouldn't be able to cut the rope.
$C: I love Bollywood has mastered the feeling of live action anime.
$C: What movie is this?  I mean seriously, this looks all kinds of awesome.
$C: Same old plot, story song and dance. Its very common in almost every indian movie and its getting boring
$C: So, what movie is this? Might be fun to watch!
$C: Is this the power of the Indo-Aryans?
$C: Seems plausible...
$C: This is how they defeated Alexander 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Looks better than Hollywood.
$C: okay... nevermind the anti-physics aspect...  did India have knights and gladiators?
$C: I would watch this
$C: I'm calling BS.    Those shields weren't even DENTED.    COME ON.... 
$C: Clearly fake. It launched over 90kg further than 300m, something any catapult would be incapable of.
$C: Bahubali Bahubali
$C: I buy it; the same thing happened to me last week.
$C: Historian here, they did this in real life
$C: Best hollywood.
$C: Bahubali!
$C: I wish north America did movies like this once i  a while. You know its rediculous, but you k ow its just a movie so you can just enjoy it. I think that's why the Expendables did so well. It was satire.
$C: My body is ready to be taken 
$C: its nothing compared to the RAJNIKANTH... XD
$C: Man. I don't think Bollywood can ever be as creative as this. They use the tried and tested formula of shitty romantic thrillers and beat public to death with it.
$C: Pretty crazy.
$C: Awesome 
$C: Tollywood things...
$C: That is amazing
$C: The tragedy is most of the people not familiar with Bollywood are laughing at it. And people familiar think it s a masterpiece.
$C: Someone please comment back with the movie tittle so I can watch it this weekend 
$C: Tollywood to be precise lol 😆 They are attacking Ajit Pai’s castle 
$C: That's one way to beat traffic! 
$C: What the hell
$C: This is why I'm not a general. 
$C: This is not a Bollywood movie and watch the movie then marvel at this badass scene
$C: Begs the question was this filmed as an action film or a comedy?
$C: Probably different planet..
$C: looks like fun

$C: Well, how about that.
$C: I remember seeing that movie, I thought they were gonna die 
$C: Ever wonder what Bollywood film school must be like?
$C: Funny? That's AWESOME! 
$C: [TLJ SPOILERS]

This is just as ridiculous as when Leia pulled herself into the shuttle
$C: This actually makes me want to see this movie.  What's it called?
$C: I would definitely watch this.
$C: That was awesome! Reminds me of one of my childhood favorites: Adventures of Baron Munchausen


$C: Looks legit
$C: i would watch it

$C: Seems logical
$C: I call bullshiat, no one is singing or dancing.... meh.  heheheheh. ;)
$C: The tree was angry that day my friends. Like an old man trying to give back soup in a Delhi.
$C: Actually this isn't a Bollywood movie but a Tollywood movie. 

But yeah it still is a WTF scene..
$C: Who let bugs bunny raise an army?
$C: Except, after they land there will be 20 minutes of dancing before the fighting started.
$C: We could use this against North Korea

They will never see it coming

$C: I liked part I of this series. This is from part IInn and it was horrible.
$C: Watched that movie literally 2 days ago and I fell asleep on the end. My gf woke me up crying . A bit hard to get into but good movie by Bollywood standard. If you can get pass the fact that the main character always have wind in his hair.
$C: it's a goblin barrel
$C: Is if funny that I actually want to watch that
$C: dope

$C: don't knock it till you've tried it
$C: The siege game has been forever changed. Iconic moment in warfare history.
$C: Goblin Barrel!
$C: I've seen that so many times, but it makes me smile every time
$C: Second highest grossing indian movie ever.
$C: That's actually pretty fucking awesome. 
$C: I'm expecting this in a new fast and furious movie, it's about the same level of realism
$C: Superhero landing done right.
$C: Still a better fight scene than Luke v. Kylo.
$C: I watched this movie in theatre. Loved this movie. Except for this scene. This scene literally made me say "What the Fuck was the director thinking?"
$C: They did a barrel roll :)
$C: The editing is honestly getting better lol
$C: Best fucking movie ever
$C: I love how they are all spinning in one direction then the next cut shows them in a opposite direction 
$C: I’ve seen that commander dancing and singing is this the same movie?
$C: Real life goblin barrel hehe
$C: bahahah! That was an interesting effect... in an odd way it's both good and super unrealistic. Like old Kung Fu Theater. lol
$C: You gotta watch Bahubali 1 before 2. One of the best movies I’ve ever seen. Complete mind bender when you put the whole story together towards the end of 2. 
$C: Wow, this is actually pretty dope.  Can confirm, would watch 10/10
$C: Lol Bahu Bahli shenanigans
$C: I know this is stupid. I get that....but I keep running through scenarios im my head about if this is possible....and Ive come to the conclusion, if thats a strong tree and even stronger shields....than yes, yes it is 
$C: A lot less sexual harassment accusations too.
$C: It feels very 300ish.
$C: OH FUCK YEAH!!!!
$C: Love it! So much disbelief in suspension! 
$C: 300 kumar and flying heroes. 
$C: I...kinda want to see more.
$C: Bollywood movies are actually pretty fucking nice (entertaining and pretty fun), never thought I would say this.
   

$C: Gonna try this in DnD.
$C: Indian folks are totally smart. Even hundreds years ago, they could calculate the trajectory so accurately  . 
$C: BAHUBALI!
$C: Bollywood needs it own subreddit for stuff like this
$C: Lit
$C: I need to see this
$C: Aim for the bushes 
$C: I hear Hollywood is struggling to find a Asian actor to play live action Aladdin. Say no more...
$C: I want to watch this now.
$C: What is the name of this movie I need to watch it
$C: Reminds me of Angry Birds.
$C: That's the best thing I ever saw!
$C: It's from the movie Bahubali: the conclusion.
First part is Bahubali: the beginning. Both English versions are available on Netflix.
Worth watching at least once.
$C: r/bettereveryloop
$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6F6u5TIUbI
$C: Baahuballi ftw
$C: hollywood can never make such visual effects, they should learn in bollywood
$C: Glorious.
$C: Better CGI than Steppenwolf. 
$C: honestly thats creative and cool. props to them!
$C: ok that was amazing! i would watch the hell out of that movie w/ the proper translations!

$C: I was gonna say "why do all Bollywood movies have terrible effects and are excessively dramatic?" But now I've watch the trailer and I need to see this
$C: Please tell me there's a subreddit full of this
$C: Death Blossom
$C: Bollywood Physics is the best physics. 
$C: This is Monte Python holy grail 2.0 in the desert.
$C: Bahubali!!!!!
$C: Almost perfect inverse kinematics. 
$C: Not as bad as Uganda Hollywood 
$C: Don’t forget the part where he blocked all those arrows with his sword. Without looking too, I think
$C: this is actually a really good movie. recommend you watch it on Netflix. 
$C: I would watch this...and I don’t even watch movies all like that.
$C: This shit crazy. Can someone pull up the one with that guy that has like a million clones and he turns all his clones into some voltron-fuckery. 
$C: No dude, this is Tollywood.
$C: I was honestly expecting more. Knowing the ridiculous nature of Bollywood movies I thought a lot more was gonna go down. Still hilarious tho
$C: I wanna see this movie!
$C: Making a mental note of this move next time I need to break a siege. Did you see how he even turned one of the bad guys to his side? Trips him up midair just to make sure he lands on his feet and now they are gonna kick ass together!
$C: This is real. It's actually what Gamera was based on.
$C: why can't i stop watching this......

$C: Watch bahubali 1 & 2. On Netflix
$C: May I add, that it is also the "highest-grossing" film of India. 

It's a feat worthy of a mention, because it's not a Bollywood production. In India where Bollywood, or shall we say the big syndicate of movie studios concentrated in Mumbai, has effortlessly obliterated the small regional/local industries. 

Here's a useful link


http://m.hindustantimes.com/regional-movies/baahubali-2-trumps-bollywood-becomes-india-s-highest-grossing-movie/story-GoIj8OKZUCuvaPjqJ8XYFL.html
$C: Bahuubali and bahuubali 2 are both 3 hr long epics of glorious ridiculousness crazier than this. Highly recommended
$C: [but what about this horse slide](https://imgur.com/cwhaqmE.gifv)
$C: What's the name of this movie, and where can I find it?

$C: Have to say,  they are very originals idea
$C: this is amazing!!
$C: Name of the film? 
$C: You ain't seen shit yet......
I give you endhiran 

https://youtu.be/kIAeSLjqSwE
$C: That looks cool enough for me to check the movie out.
$C: I like how the bowmen on the wall don't even turn around, let's just die while the enemy is in our walls... 
$C: They didn’t just do a barrel roll, they created the barrel
$C: As an Indian I'm quite proud of this

$C: Repost at 115k updoots plus gold? u/GallowBoob must be pulling his hair out.
$C: Damn I gotta watch more Bollywood

$C: Do these movies come with subtitles? And where can I find them lol? 
$C: What Sikh guys.
$C: Still a better story than transformers
$C: Yeah, thanks Cory2020
$C: That's pretty awesome. 

Boken bones and the lot if reality were put into play, but visually they did this well. I keep watchng it because of how cool they look when they stand up. Captain America could pull this off. 
$C: Gotta say, that's actually pretty cool.
$C: Hheeccttiicc!!! 
$C: BB1 or Baahubali the beginning.  Funny enough this guy and his two part epic was widely popular but was controversial in breaking many bollywood production norms.


$C: 10/10 on the landing.
$C: Its funny and cool. Its actually that well stuck landing that made me forget about science.
$C: Lol you guys need to watch more Bollywood movies with subs there way funnier than anything American tbh. They're very underrated
$C: What did I just witness
$C: Bollywood makes my childhood fantasies come true. This is the shit I day dream about being able to do when I was a child.
$C: This is the palm trees first major movie role 
$C: Jeor Mormont got sick of winter I guess.
$C: Thats dope
$C: Those dudes are badass!
$C: They did the math on this one
$C: u/koutis
$C: Holy shit that was so badass.. Im gonna have to start watching bollywood movies. Ive seen clips of different ones over the years and they always look so good. 
$C: For those who don't know, this is the second highest grossing Bollywood movie of all time
$C: This is a pretty accurate depiction of historical events
$C: Yup this was fuckin' awesome
$C: This looks like a scene from dragon ball z
$C: So from a training and tactics perspective, how do you suppose they drill that maneuver?  
$C: Who needs a Trojan horse when you’ve got the balls to launch yourself into a spinning shield wall barrel of doom from a coconut tree.
$C: damnnn
this film was from tollywood not Bollywood
please read before write
$C: Theyre getting good.
$C: the trebuchet is the superior siege engine
$C: Lol even the CG was confused which way they should all land. Still hilariously awesome though
$C: It's not Bollywood 
$C: This is some anime type shit. I love Bollywood movies 
$C: This is Tollywood, not Bollywood. Different region of India. All the over the top action films you see out of India are Tollywood, whereas all the musical dance films are Bollywood. That's an oversimplification but a good basic guide. 
$C: Is this really THAT much more outlandish than lets say... 300? The way it is shot seems very similar based off the trailer! 
$C: The part that bothers me most is that we clearly see them sailing way above/past the wall, and then suddenly they just barely make it over the edge.
$C: If you think that’s slick you should watch some of the movies from the 70s and 80s. The special effects are amazing. 
$C: Pefectly landing
$C: awww this movie again...Too much dancing and singing. 
$C: Normally Bollywood stuff looks like crap, but damn if that didn't look badass!
$C: This is amazing, Bollywood has stepped their shit right up.
$C: r/bettereveryloop
$C: I thought they were going to roll down the ramp like a barrel at first.
$C: exciting
$C: Technically it's Tollywood, but yeah there was a Hindi version as well
$C: *Tollywood* movie NOT Bollywood movie

Telugu cinema, also known by its sobriquet Tollywood, is the segment of Indian cinema dedicated to the production of motion pictures in the Telugu language, based in Hyderabad, Telangana.
$C: I hate to be "that guy" but that's not Bollywood. Not all Indian movies are Bollywood. Although Bollywood has started resorting to such antics to make money. It's one of those cases where a meme was dragged on too long and became a normal thing. 
$C: It was pretty funny to see it in theatre. 

FYI: Bollywood is for " Hindi " films, this is from a Telugu film ( Telugu films are so called as Tollywood in India) 
$C: Just wow 
$C: omg! I laughed at this way harder than I expected!
$C: Are they still hiring for extra casts?
$C: Technically this isn't Bollywood, it's South Indian. 

Also, Hollywood at it's finest: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwHT0_gPwxQ


$C: Technically not Bollywood. This gem is from the Tamil film industry
$C: Looks more believable than the latest Star Wars flick...
$C: The best scene is about 20 seconds afterwards when one of the other groups flying across hit the wall and just splatter everywhere
$C: Please tell me there's a Bollywood subreddit
$C: A fun fact: the makers of this movie took 7 years to finish the entire movie because India didn’t have good graphic teams. 

Another fun fact: that movie is originally not from Bollywood. It’s from tollyhood, movies in Telugu.
$C: GOT i was strong then.
$C: And then the [victory dance](https://i.imgur.com/bK7WkWR.gifv)
$C: I need the name of this movie
$C: What movie is this from?
$C: i just feel so personally attacked right now

$C: this is amazing :)
$C: And......he sticks the landing!!
$C: One of the biggest movies of india that made millions ...
$C: MRW my study group & I come in for the finals to kick ass but we pulled all nighters and are hallucinating.
$C: This was the best gif to watch yo start my day
$C: Funny how Elon is spending all this money digging underground when all he really needs is a piece of rope and a tree
$C: As a experimental super-theoretical physicist, I don't see an issue here. Trebuchet science has come a long way. 


$C: So the Marvel movies are basically Bollywood at this point.
$C: So realistic. Its like it really happened. 
$C: great job man. Thats nowhere near hollywood but youre almost there.
$C: Talk to me when he does a 360 no scope at the landing. 
$C: totally not cgi
$C: That's what "john" from indian scam tech support does on his time off
$C: Why make siege weapons when you can ride a palm tree? 
$C: That was actually really awesome! 
$C: I thoroughly enjoyed this. 
$C: lol very creative tbh
$C: Oh, but the physics!!!
$C: Not actually a Bollywood film. Its from the Tamil Film Industry or Tollywood as its known here.
$C: This and the first two are the only 2 Bollywood movies ice ever seen.

Not a fan of the Bollywood genre or films but these were so good.
$C: Looks like this could pass off as a scene in the mechanic. 
$C: I remember learning about this in history
$C: Better than the barrel scene from The Hobbit, tbh.
$C: That was freakin awesome!
$C: What anime is this?
$C: 10/10 would work
$C: Seems legit.
$C: I like that Bollywood has just embraced its weirdness and gone full ham with this shit.
$C: This is the greatest film I've seen this year. My friends and I only put it on as a joke but soon we were hooked.
$C: Reminded me of Monty Python
$C: I think you mean “Film making at its finest.”
$C: Ah yes, I remember reading about this technique in The Art Of War.
$C: Where are the Myth Busters when you need someone to test if this can really happen? Guess I have to try this at home... Who's with me?
$C: I want to watch this now...
$C: It's just me or is Bollywood getting better lmao
$C: Historically accurate.
$C: Yo they just made 300 look like child's play.
$C: Then 8000 people showed up and they all spontaneously started dancing. 
$C: To be correct, it’s a Telugu movie so it’s tollywood
$C: What's the name of the movie? 


You know, for research.
$C: I never knew that's what I wanted to happen 
$C: Me and a few of my buddies tried something like that in high school.  It didn't work as well, though. 
$C: DC comics should take note
$C: It’s like live action anime physics 
$C: It’s great that the leads in Bollywood action flicks have slimmed down, of late. 
$C: Missed the drop dash! You're supposed to hold X on the way down, Arin!
$C: r/bollywoodrealism
$C: That was delightful.
$C: This movie is on Netflix. 
$C: I loved how the archers didn't give a single fuck.
$C: I was yesterday at Star Wars.  
SPOILER ALERT
  
>~~Looks like Leia flight~~
$C: That was bad ass tho.
$C: Lol!!

I'm not too fancy for their accents, regardless if speaking American English or their native language, but I shit you not: I will watch this whole film, and even read subtitles if there is no dub.

What is this majestic film of perfection gold called?
$C: That. Was. Beautiful. ***tears up***
$C: I swear bollywood is just like real life anime action scenes. 
$C: This is what happens when your physicists leave the country.
$C: FWIW This is Tollywood.
$C: OMFG LOL WAAAAT
$C: This... scene was intended to be funny and not serious, yes?
$C: Bruhh, I wanna watch this. 
$C: Scenes like this have made me decide that if anyone should be in charge of producing a film/TV version of the Stormlight Archives, it should come from Bollywood. They would get it right. 
$C: It's ok cuz they're not white guys
$C: The training for this maneuver must have brutal.
$C: Lol. Bahubali was so over the top
$C: Still more realistic than a Fast and Furious Movie
$C: This is anime as fuck
$C: Looks very inventive and well executed. If only they knew how to do movies like that over here
$C: Another incredible movie is '3 Idiots'. Watch it if you get the chance!
$C: I wonder if indians ever take our movie clips and go wow americans are crazy lol
$C: Kim Jong un's rocket test colourized (2017) 
$C: So pretty much every Bollywood movie is Kung Pow?
$C: It's good - but it's no Legolas at Helm's Deep
$C: Into your girls DMs like...
$C: Lol why do they do this shit it's fucking great though
$C: Bollywood knows how to do live action anime scenes.
$C: Cast *limited wish* for *Feather fall* to take effect near end of trip

fling guys at castle

everyone makes acrobatics rolls

easy!
$C: That was cool as shit tho
$C: Those were great movies and there were many scenes that made me laugh at how ridiculous it is.  But, these movies are the top grossing Bollywood movies of all time so there must be something to it.  
$C: Man, I need to watch more Bollywood. The trailer for this looks amazing.
$C: That shit could happen

$C: Sunny Leone approves 
$C: auuhhhh this is soo good.
$C: BAAHUBALI!!!! These movies were fantastic. 
$C: They are getting better.
$C: What I love most is what appears to be an automated animation triggering to reload in the archer after they get slightly jostled.
$C: The other archers just stand there and shoot at nothing as a group of soliders with iron shields fly into the air in a ball shape
$C: Is this on Netflix?

Does anyone know what it’s called?

I have to see this now.
$C: Newton is probably crying in his grave 
$C: What movie is this and is it in english. Its gotta be the best scene I've seen in a long while. 
$C: What movie is this? I need it so badly. 
$C: physics? what is physics
$C: [Hey dude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2MF7bTRreY)
$C: I want to watch this movie now 
$C: It's a pretty good movie though. Baahubali 
$C: Although the effects look off and bad i still find them great!!
$C: Gotta give them points for creativity though.
$C: So creative but so funny? what do you think like me?
$C: That is some good movie making. I was interested in each shot.
$C: r/trebuchetmemes my want to have a word with this gif. Otherwise, fucking love it. Looks so fun! 
$C: Who needs The Avengers when you have these guys?
$C: That was shava shava levels of dopeness
$C: They missed the transition
$C: “We make very gord movie, do we get suk on bob now?”
$C: Im disappointed this is the first I've seen this. Clearly a superior alternative to the trebuchet.. And they stick the landing 
$C: This is pretty fire
$C: I saw this movie when I visited India and the CGI animations were fun. 
$C: That's badass
$C: Isn't this technically tollywod?
$C: Man, this makes me wish humans were a lot more durable than we are.
$C: This is amazing hahahahaha 
$C: This is AMAZING!
$C: The Lord of the Singhs
$C: +1 conversion point.

Enemy in Red bottom has switched sides.
$C: Checks out. Physical effects obvs
$C: Yeah, ok, respect that outside the box thinkin...but what the hell you gonna do now 6 medieval paratroppers? I counted 30 archers in just a small screenshot there.

yall about to go down like Leonidus did.
$C: This should have been in the Last Jedi 
$C: 🅱️ollywood
$C: I now know who needs to make our dbz movie. 
$C: What movie is this?
$C: This is great!
$C: Snoop needs to provide the audio commentary.
$C: The Fast and the Furious 8 is on the same level as this one.
$C: What movie
$C: Actually badass
$C: This reminds me of Ender’s Game.
$C: Looks like more fun than Justice League. 
$C: No, no fucking reposts gets 140k upvotes no, that’s a big fucking no
$C: Finest? They're not even using the superior siege engine.
$C: Would've worked a lot better if they used a trebuchet
$C: My favorite anime!
$C: Name of the movie? I gotta watch now.
$C: Why are the rest of the archers totally ignoring the ball of shielded men that just took out a handful of them?
$C: Just as plausible as anything in the Fast and Furious movies 
$C: Each warrior soldier launched via Palm Tree Catapult gains +2 to Attack and gains flying untill end of turn. 
.
And how can I not mention the timeless "tuck and roll" tactic that has been so beautifully deployed here (gives standing applause)
http://gph.is/19mUnnb
$C: This is from Peter Jackson's 'The Hobbit', right?

Edit: Nope, I looked closer. This is way more believable and realistic.
$C: When Did one of the guys change into Red pants ??? Must have been in the shield barrel roll
$C: https://imgflip.com/i/2151br
$C: That's a great movie. if you watch its best in the non-dubbed Telugu version.
$C: This is tollywood and not Bollywood.
$C: Baahubali. Nice
$C: I seen this 20 times 
$C: This movies actually really entertaining
$C: Trojan horse? We don’t need no stinkin horse
$C: What does Bollywood mean? 
$C: Bolly, baby, you've come a *long* way.  ;D
$C: Nice repost.
$C: Honestly, the only difference between this and some Hollywood action movies is the camera work/direction. I've seen stuff just as ridiculous in normal action movies, they just make it look more serious.
$C: Damnit Hollywood, stop with the reboots and give me more movies that have reasons to catapult a team of knights into castles. Bollywood gets it.
$C: Yeet
$C: This looks like a commercial for deodorant or an energy drink or something.
$C: That was some next level shit 
$C: Wow!
Creativity at high levels!
$C: Still more believable than any Rock movie.
$C: No, the horse sliding under the truck is classic Bollywood... this is just an example of good movie production!
$C: Was kind of hoping they’d be fighting the bad guys in that Uganda guy’s movies. 
$C: Hahaha holy fuck, I have to watch this masterpiece.
$C: Well, it's Tollywood
$C: That was dope
$C: Wardrobe change, mid-flight apparently. 
$C: Aaa the good ole repost
$C: Say what you will about the physics, this movie was absolutely awesome
$C: This is so bad I can't stop watching it
$C: Bahubali!!!
$C: But if you have a tower shield you shouldn't have to take falling damage...
$C: Actually pretty cool but you can tell it's fake because they used a palm tree and not a trebuchet. 
$C: Imagine if they had a trebuchet
$C: This is awesome.  Matches the hijinks nowadays of Hollywood's finest (example:  barrel ride in The Hobbit)
$C: I want to watch this now. 
$C: Alexander the Great ain’t got shit on these guys. 
$C: Trueeee
$C: It’s a south indian cinema
$C: This movie (both parts) is amazing and beautiful, badass and hilarious. Plus the soundtrack is awesome
$C: What movie is that!   I must see it. 
$C: That is not a Bollywood movie. That's from Bahubali, the highest grossing Telugu movie
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baahubali_2:_The_Conclusion

Bollywood is the umbrella term used for Hindi movies coming out of Bombay, India.
$C: this was a rollercoaster ride from start to finish
$C: When they are landing on the archers, the other archers in the background don't even bother to look. They would totally notice the weird shield person ordinance that is the only thing flying at them.

I've determined that this movie is unrealistic.
$C: This is the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen. I am SO watching this movie tonight... provided I can actually find it somewhere to buy... and provided it has subtitles.

Say, is there a Netflix for Bollywood movies?
$C: I love bollywood "stunts" like this.
$C: For those who play Rainbow 6 siege: Recruit Rush {-}7

$C: I can't stop watching it.
$C: r/gifsthatendtoosoon
$C: Sliding in her DM's like...
$C: I'm pissed I've never seen or thought of this before
$C: /u/beyourshelf
$C: Not Bollywood
$C: https://youtu.be/94BzBOpv42g

trailer of the movie
$C: Honestly this seems like a film id love to watch
$C: What movie is this
$C: How many takes did these guys need to get this down so good?
$C: Damn Bollywood has really stepped up its game! Last Bollywood movie I saw was just a bunch of women singing and dancing. 
$C: You know what, I might actually watch this movie.
$C: No joke, that was pretty awesome and funny.
$C: Thats a movie from Tollywood haha..
$C: This kind of ridiculousness in movies is everywhere. Yesterday, I was watching Punisher's last episodes, the 10 Minutes timer in the computer runs forever giving them ample time to do tasks that would easily span 3-4 hours.
$C: Well, there you go. That's how you climb the wall between Mexico and U.S.
$C: After watching the trailer I'm convinced Stephen Chow & Zack Snyder made a Bollywood Baby and he's now directing movies.
$C: So Bollywood is India's version of WWE, with (a slight) more intelligence, much more theatre, and somewhat moderated testosterone?
$C: Full send 
$C: That was clean!
$C: The sad thing is there’s parents who’ll watch this gold and tell their kids this is actually what happened millennia ago.
$C: The guy behind what I assume is the protagonist after he bounces materializes a shield and is definitely one of the enemies that was hit.
$C: Now I want to watch the whole thing. 
$C: WhaddYA MEAN!
$C: This is wholesome.
Btw. It seems like all men with projectiles are horrible at aimimg when it comes to movies
$C: What movie is this
$C: Everyone thought Legolas’ shield shit was the bomb right? 

Yeah well....now ya all no the troof!
$C: I put a hold on a library copy.
$C: I will definitely be watching this after work.
$C: 👌🏻
$C: I've always been kind of confused by Bollywood. It often seems like you can't be sure if you're going to end up watching the Indian equivalent of Mamma Mia or some glorious Mission Impossible-meets-Elite Beat Agents madness until you're halfway through the movie.
$C: That coordination tho...
$C: Gods they were coordinated then!
$C: I couldn’t help but notice the horrendous use of a catapult. Do they not know that the trebuchet is the superior siege engine and is capable of launching a 90kg projectile over 300 meters ?
$C: Steve Oedekerk promised us a sequel. 
$C: Treebuchet is the superiour siege engine. 
$C: Please what the name of this movie ????????
$C: Would...would that work 0_o?

That was super well done!
$C: The director plays Clash Royale and is a fan of the Goblin Barrel card!
$C: Looks like someone has been playing with the gravity and inertia sliders.
$C: As cheesy as it seems, it's still pretty badass!
$C: Does this remind you of bleach season 1 when they get launched into soul society?
$C: This is actually a great watch. Has all kinds of this action.

$C: umm wow
$C: Does this have english subs? Cause I would totally watch this. 
$C: Hahaha. A lot of actual ancient Indian history are mixed with myths, I expect nothing less. 
$C: physics ignored
$C: Well that's one way to siege a fort
$C: I would not be able to sit through this film.
$C: I thought this was the movie poster from the [Brady Bunch Movie](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0e/Brady_bunch_movie_poster.jpg) from the thumbnail.
$C: That was pretty epic though....
$C: Seems legit
$C: I need to watch more bollywood movies

$C: That was pretty cool 
$C: Now I MUST see this movie, what is it?
$C: There's no way that could happen. 
$C: What movie is this? I'm stuck in hospital with a broken leg, and this looks like a fun movie to watch.

$C: I'm a little disappointed that their flying, rotating circle didn't speed up as they drew themselves together - so unrealistic...

/s
$C: Well now I want to see this movie.
$C: Never ever change, Bollywood. 
$C: It's a legitimate strategy 
$C: I mean, compared to what it was this is proof Bollywood has come a long way!
$C: Lmao 
$C: That LANDING tho :o
$C: What is this video called?

$C: I discovered these on Netflix a couple weeks ago. I watched portions of all the different dialect versions, looking for the original language to hear what the actual actor's voices sounded like. What really struck me is how different the subtitles are for the 3 versions. You'd think they would do one set of subtitles and apply it to all 3 versions, but they apparently didn't.
$C: GG
$C: Anyone else think they were going to roll down that ramp?

$C: LOL. it's only possible in Hollywood. 
$C: Truth be told, that actually looks pretty badass.
$C: That was fucking awesome.
$C: Bollywood physics at its finest
$C: This is really well done actually! 
$C: Fantastic!
$C: What is the best Bollywood movie to watch, along these lines?
$C: That was beautiful
$C: I just found Part one on Netflix. 
$C: That's pretty stupid but also pretty awesome. 
$C: Bahubali!!!
$C: That dudes pants turned red.
$C: I have wanted to see a Die Hard sequel done by a Bollywood director for years. Just old ass John Mclain spouting one-liners, and ridiculously kicking ass. 
$C: Legit
$C: Graceful landing
$C: Holy fuck that was awesome!
$C: Kung fury vibe
$C: I knew penetrating Troy in a big wooden horse was too farfetched
$C: I was thinking Team Rocket blasting off again....
$C: This how really Troy fell
$C: mfw was expecting ajit pai meme
$C: Awesome
$C: That's around 2 million sandals, we all are not single legged.
$C: Catapalmism will grow every quarter
$C: #DnDGoals
$C: Okay i got to see this anyone knows the movie's name? XD
$C: Is there any r/ that only show Bollywood physics?
$C: I need to watch this movie now!!!
$C: ok this is late but can this be a mythbusters episode pls thank u
$C: Realism- 100
$C: I see nothing wrong here?
$C: apart from the immediate death on impact, it seems like a good way to invade
$C: Best duology I've ever watched! Makes LOTR a joke to laugh about 
$C: Haha noice
$C: Looks like Goblin Barrel from Clash Royale
$C: Thank you. I just watched 5 hours of film because of this scene! And the whole combat around this clip is really cool :)
$C: That was so fantastically absurd LMAO
$C: Not sure about anyone else but that's what makes Bollywood movies so good. Very few Hollywood movies would go this far over the top and I like the ridiculousness of it.
$C: Best movie ever
$C: http://thepolicytimes.com/tiger-zinda-hai-ready-surpass-₹-200-cr/

New box office record 
$C: that was incredible 
$C: That is so amazing haha I'd love to see how they film this in the studio
$C: Goblin barrel
#ClashRoyale
$C: I SEE THIS EVERY DAY REPOSTED
$C: Inspiring
$C: seems legit
$C: stunt men. FAKEEE
$C: What is not often mentioned in this post is that immediately after this scene the OTHERS follow suit and begin throwing their own clusters. It's as hilarious and awesome as it sounds.
$C: No helmet for the first guy? That’s just mean.
$C: Bollywood seems to have film after film about people defying physics. Michael Bay would probably kill it over there.
$C: I seek out this movie because of the gif,
was disappointed that there was no training for this.
$C: Clash Royale next update adding Barbarian Barrel 
$C: dude how many takes do you think that took to get it so perfect
$C: how would you practice that

$C: Believe me when I say you haven't seen anything yet.
$C: where's all the dancing at
$C: I’d watch it
$C: if you dont think that is sick than...well idk
$C: Hilarious!
$C: CHECK OUT WHOSE PHYSIQUE GIRLS CHOOSE JOHN ABRAHAHM VS TIGER SHROFF https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiyYoZUXVBM&lc=z22yi5ibhljvszwlgacdp43bfc0uwslt2pme3114oytw03c010c

$C: Awsome
$C: Goblin barrel
$C: This should be in the next game of thrones series for real.... LMAO 
$C: This, my foreign brothers and sisters, is Bahubali
$C: i wish they did barrel rolls on the wall before breaking up..
$C: Bahubali 1&2 are pretty great movies.
Minus the dance and songs and crappy cgi
$C: Is this an epic or a comedy?
$C: Bahubali was hilarious but also painful to watch. After what seemed like ages the movie ended, BUT AT A CLIFFHANGER AND LEAD TO AN EQUALLY LONG SEQUEL.
$C: Now that's what i call ridicoluse
$C: Was that an actual stunt
$C: A TL;DR to all Bollywood movies: the mans gf or daughter/son get captured he get 10 bullets to the arm and loses one of the legs, and then at the end they reunite and live happily ever after (also don't worry i am an expert because all of my aunts watch them 24/7)
$C: I'm America this would be obvious and in your face comedy but bollywood takes this seriously and that's amazing. 
$C: It is actually Tollywood*, btw.
$C: I'm not saying this was one of them, but some bollywood action movies have ridiculous scenes like this because they're memeing about how crazy some bollywood action scenes are. A lot of people can't tell its a self aware meme and think its just another bollywood movie
$C: directed by Zack Snyder
$C: This is Tollywood, not Bollywood. 
$C: I like how its both high quality and god awful.
$C: This is not Bollywood. It's Tollywood instead.
$C: Not bollywood. Tollywood.
$C: I think the banana killing video is a better representation of the best of Bollywood
$C: At least they are getting better at movies
$C: Found it on Pirate Bay
https://thepiratebay.org/search/Baahubali/0/99/0

$C: Between the production values on this and that other movie earlier this year with the big dance scene, "Bollywood" will soon no longer be the quasi-insult that it currently is.
$C: Isn't that the plot of Angry Birds?
$C: It’s actually tollywood
$C: Is there a place I can watch these kinds of movies dubbed/subtitled (in english) online for free?
$C: 10 for the idea, 10 for the execution, 7 for the landing

Quality military strategy

Edit: it froze on me. Just saw the TRUE landing where he got back up immediately like a BAFM. Changing landing score to 11/10

New overall evaluation: the new Sun Tzu
$C: But it's not Bollywood though ?!
$C: r/bollywoodrealism
$C: I don’t know, but i don’t think that’s real...that palm tree doesn’t have enough tension to throw the men that far... probably CGI...
$C: I love how the dude, that drops to the lower left after impact, just disappears into the ground :D
$C: Cgi is the single greatest thing to ever happen to Bollywood.
$C: I love Bahubali, great movie.
$C: Second cool Bollywood clip I've seen on Reddit recently. Uh, guess I'm getting into Bollywood movies, then.
$C: DM: ok, go ahead and try. *rolls natural 20*
$C: Its Tollywood's finest. its from the movie Baahubali 2: The Conclusion.
$C: Steamrolling into white girl’s Facebook dm’s
$C: This isn't Bollywood. This is Tollywood. Telugu film industry. 
$C: might it just be that indian men have a collective power fantasy? this might also explain /r/indianpeoplefacebook
$C: When she says " i hide all bobs and vegina pics inside castle"
$C: It’s not a Bollywood movie. It’s a South Indian movie. 
$C: - It is actually Tollywood(movies in Telugu language). Bollywood is for Hindi movies.
- Name of the movie is Baahubali. It was released in two parts.
- This is the most expensive and highest grossing India movie ever. The graphics, average as they are, are miles ahead of anything else in an Indian movie.
$C: This is not bollywood, this is Tamil Cinema. Bollywood refers to Hindi cinema which are made in Bombay.
$C: Who would want to watch that shit?
$C: I hope Bollywood never stops having this level of inventiveness in their movies.  It's truly wonderful.
$C: r/bollywoodrealism
$C: This ain't even Bollywood! It's a regional film. From Tollywood.
$C: So Bollywood is meant to be cliche and tongue in cheek? Like Hotshots and Airplane?
$C: u/mynameisakshayk this is actually pretty awesome 
$C: I'm sure this has been said before but THIS IS NOT BOLLYWOOD!! 
$C: It's not Bollywood, it's Tollywood- The South Indian cinema. It has its own language and subculture. 
$C: Bollywood is really just anime in movie form.
$C: The X-Men got nothing on these guys!
$C: Still better than Justice League.
$C: I am disappointed that they didn't break into a song and dance routine after they landed. *That* would have been Bollywood at its finest. 
$C: Berry realistic 
$C: ALLL HAIL MAHISHMATI
$C: These Mission Impossible movies have gotten ridiculous.
$C: 11/10 would see this movie
$C: Sticks the landing
$C: I mean this part is hilarious, but right after the whole army does the exact same thing. And you see seas of men being launched through the air in this formation it's nuts.
$C: Best action sequence!
$C: And you all thought that Indians only use coconut trees for dancing...
$C: bollywood, tollywood? 
I thought Flywood at its finest
$C: should've used a trebuchet
$C: Man, now I completely understand /r/indianpeoplefacebook
$C: As an Indian I am insulted. This is Tollywood, not Bollywood. Big difference. Look it up 
$C: 1min silence for all who thinks this is Bollywood. This is Tollywood from South India
$C: It's not Bollywood btw, it's a Telugu movie, from Hyderabad. 

And the highest grossing movie in India. 
$C: Bollywood is awesome.

$C: Oh -- Legolas could do that no problem
$C: Energy companies would pay billions of dollars to get so much momentum from bending a tree. We could use it to fire missiles next.
$C: They even had the time to change their pants midair in that man-barrel ! 
$C: Finest? God help us all.
$C: This is actually not one ounce more stupid than basically every Marvel movie in the last 5 years. 
$C: The writers must have the best weed in the world.
$C: Weird how much brigading is going on here with people pretending this could be seriously good.
$C: I just watched both these movies all the way through because of this post and comments. Thanks reddit and thanks YouTube  because I've probably wouldn't of went out ofnmy way to rent, buy, or watch them. Now I might actually buy them. It's an awesome and beautiful movie/s.
$C: I would greatly appreciate the version of this with corrected physics. For example, when he cuts the rope they all get flung straight to the ground.
$C: This was one of the most talked movies among my Indian coworkers. I think they even take it seriously lmao.
$C: I am ashamed of being Indian.
$C: Bullshit, where’s the happy singing and dancing? 
$C:  #1 on /r/all and it's not a Bollywood clip at all. The level of ignorance is astonishing :-)

The people who upvoted this are quite possibly the same people who mock people for saying *ATM machine*. Different rules when it's your own stupidity, huh?

This is a Telugu movie clip. Bollywood is essentially Hindi language movies (made in Bombay).
$C: Not Bollywood, it's movie from Tollywood! Though movies from Bollywood suck too.
$C: I lucking flove it!  That, boys and girls, is how you do the thang.
$C: This couldn't be a Bollywood movie.  There's no extended song and dance sequence that breaks out on the rooftop with the two opposing armies.
$C: gah,,Bollywood is just so dumb
$C: Bollywood can't physics. 😂😂😂
$C: That is the dumbest thing ever
$C: [deleted]
$C: This movie promotes Hindu fascism.
$C: Indian space program
$C: Arabian avengers!
$C: This is NOT a Bollywood movie. It’s a “Telugu” movie - made in Telangana & Andhra - South Indian film Industry. Bollywood is North Indian film Industry which is primarily based in Mumbai (which is NOT in north India). 
South Indian film Industry produces movies in several languages of which most are made in Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, some Kannada languages.
$C: There needs to be a Mythbusters devoted to these films.
$C: I think it’s the right time for the world to watch Mr. Balakrishna’s movies.
$C: This gets posted like once a week 
$C: This would have been perfectly realistic if they hadn't thrown them into outer space in the first launch shot. Like...why do they go so beyond the mark? For the love of god.
$C: Removed
$C: Milk truk jus arrive
$C: If anyone is showing themselves to be immature it is you my friend. I'm not going to dignify it with an explanation because I don't think your able to have an adult conversation about it.
You like what you like and I'll like what I like. 
$C: Here's another epic scene from the same movie: https://youtu.be/3CxDyqw5zZ8

$C: Look at the archers left from where the ... payload hits the ground. It's the same animation played 3 times next to each other. God it's aweful
$C: [deleted]
$C: [removed]
$C: This kind of equals out the shit on the street in India.
$C: Hahahah these chumps will never compare to Hollywood.
$C: Sucks 
$C: *Tollywood
$C: Its Tollywood 
$C: It's tollywood they just dubbed it into hindi
$C: It's not BollyWood! It's not a hindi movie. 
$C: That's not bollywood , that's tollywood 
$C: Technically it's Tollywood. 
$C: Bahubali!!!!!
$C: OMG, I love stuff like this.  So awesome!
$C: Inspiration: Clash Royale Goblin Barrel
$C: Wtf
$C: This is from Baahubali 2: The Conclusion ,

$C: This movie Is a tollywood movie that was dubbed into hindi. 
$C: Lol...it can only happen in Bollywood 
$C: Is this a documentary?
$C: Looks good, doesn't work.
$C: Bahubali 2, it's not a Bollywood movie, it's a Tollywood production- Bollywood is more realistic and Tollywood is more fantastical
$C: Actually this is Tollywood 
$C: I hate bollywood
$C: There is nothing fine about Bollywood.  Just unbelievable advanced levels of stupid.
$C: I knew a guy in high school who's cousin worked with some dudes who were traveling in South Asia, or maybe it was South America; well anyways,  I guess they saw people doing this a lot, so yeah, that totally can happen.
$C: 🖖🏻
$C: Fuck this Bollywood
$C: Oh man this repost yeah it's great totally not the THIRD FUCKING TIME IT's MADE IT TO R/ALL IN THE LAST YEAR!
$C: This is actually their space program. They 're tryin to get to the moon.
$C: [deleted]
$C: They can make movies but not toilets. Hmmm
$C: I have seen this gif for millions time now. Can we stop?
$C: [deleted]
$C: I honestly expected way more bahubali references in this thread
$C: There's no limits for Bollywood 
$C: This just further proves that Bollywood movies are written by 8 year old boys with g.i. Joe's.
$C: I'm not sure what Bollywood is, but I'm guessing some kind of professional looking home made videos? 
$C: Bollywood movies are only good in these short clips.. I tried going into some thinking. "This is gonna be stupid fun"... But just. Too much stupid, and not enough fun if you watch the whole thing. :D
$C: Who taught these people how to shoot movies?
$C: Movie Name: Baahubali
The Beginning - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5FvgdI6h-c

This is the original. It is originally a South Indian Telugu Movie(Tollywood) Dubbed in Hindi(Bollywood). #justsaying

$C: THAT’S NOT EVEN BOLLYWOOD!!!
$C: Wow actually something creative out of bollywood.  Mostly it's just mind numbing repetitive dance numbers and Goofy dialog meant catering to the lowest common denominator audience
$C: I'm so embarrassed to be Indian right now.
$C: Its not bollywood you dumbass...its tollywood ....
$C: This looks like some anime bullshit
$C: Wow, idk about you but,

May he poop on my knee?

 You know what I mean?
$C: [removed]
$C: Please someone animate this as a new downvote gif!!!
$C: The Matrix: Retarded
$C: Do Indians actually take this shit seriously
$C: I wonder, do they realize how dumb, absurd, and funny this is, and roll with it or is that their version of https://youtu.be/IhnUgAaea4M?t=7s 100% cool and $wag 
$C: I hate the fact that on Netflix the category for "MOVIES MADE IN 1990s" Solely consist of bad movies and Bollywood movies. Like For fuck sake. GIVING IN TO MULTICULTURALISM MUCH??? No one wants to watch this shit Netflix.
$C: 152k upvotes WTH? Only if Net Neutrality posts could’ve gotten this much attention, maybe it could’ve stood a chance. 
$C: Do the audience of these things KNOW that's not how physics works, and just enjoy the action?  Or is that... like.. realistic for them?
$C: Indians ugly and stupid. 
$C: They lost a lot of good men that day.
$C: They're in Bollywood, no such thing as more than one take.
$C: My first thought was literally- ‘that was pretty sick’. I don’t even talk like that
$C: They should have began by drinking an entire beer to prove it isn't the 468th attempt
$C: Nah man, that was pretty Sikh 
$C: Enough tries change their pants, the second guy magically got red pants...
$C: If you got it just right then you’d miss the ramp they hit. You’d want to adjust back to the left a little so you’d be right on the money.
$C: /r/KenM 
$C: This gif doesn’t even do it justice. 

This is just the beginning of the scene when the heroes jump in initially. They are followed by their entire army employing the same tactic. The whole scene is the heroes fighting while a torrent of soldiers falls from the skies to help them. I died laughing when my friend showed me. 
$C: “Let’s start with the catapult scene.  We don’t wanna have to reshoot the whole movie if... well...”
$C: KenM?
$C: They should have drank a beer before doing it to prove it was done within a few tries.
$C: It was more than slick! It was fucking Brilliant! Did you see how many of the soldiers they took out on the rampart? That general needs a promotion!
$C: Some say, they're still tryin'.
$C: It's bollywood. They did it in 1. Duh! 
$C: 1
$C: Was that a catapult or a trebuchet?
$C: “Murphy this is cowboy over.”
$C: “To shreds you say”
$C: 468
$C: Do you not wonder what’s the velocity of 8 grown men in full armour? 
$C: This would be sick of it was an anime
$C: amazing
$C: It's a real superheroes!
$C: And for the adventurous this movie is on Netflix..search baahubali 
$C: That's funny!
$C: The real bullshit is that palm tree roots are way too weak to launch that many people that far without ripping.
$C: At least 12
$C: /r/trebuchetmemes/
$C: They should have had to chug a beer before each take. 
$C: 7
$C: They would've gone about 200 meters farther had they used a trebuchet
$C: r/moviephysics
$C: Not Bollywood 😂
$C: This movie is called Bahubali they spent a shit ton 
$C: You only got one shot
$C: Taking into account that a few stuntmen may have been injured, 100% more than 3 takes. 
$C: a few more takes than they did
$C: Who knows, they didn't drink a beer before the shot.
$C:  This was actually the first scene they shot. The actors who survived got to star in the film. Took them 17 tries.
$C: Many. They had to cut the dance scene out Bc they couldn't nail both those takes on time.
$C: The trick is to film those scenes first.  You don't want to waste filming the other parts only to find out your main actors died and can't use the footage.
$C: Wow and here i was thinking that this was fake. Thanks
$C: Once. 
$C: Was that an Indian Patrick Stewart that cut the rope?
$C: Just the one!!
$C: The Hercules of India!
$C: meh, they ripped that off from *The 300*
$C: That bracelet that they turned into in their flying formation would have given great power to the giant form.
$C: In India they treat people like Dukes of Hazzard cars
$C: How does it feel to float in Karma heaven ?
$C: Jai mahishmathi!!!✊
$C: They got it right the first time. 
$C: /r/bollywoodrealism will 'ppreciate this
$C: I am an indian but still this is hard to watch
$C: I actually sat thinking "How many times have these soldiers done this that they all know what they're doing? How did they practice this? How many soldiers die fucking this up? What if they just hit the wall?"
$C: They were inspired by angry birds game. It's a Tollywood movie (south India) called BAAHUBALI break records of our cinema industry.
$C: There's no WAY that's real!
$C: I wish I could see this post but my ISP is known to be against Bollywood politics. So I’m not allowed to see it because of the new rules. Can someone please write to me here what’s going on in the scene ?
$C: About as many as it took to get Liam Neeson over that fence.
$C: Have you guys heard of a joke whats the difference between a bucket of shit and an indian? Just the bucket. Please dont downvote me
$C: [removed]
$C: I love movies that totally don't take themselves seriously, but are still really badass.  
$C: [Bollywood and Tollywood is full of shit like this](https://imgur.com/6Kd19FM)
$C: The movie was rated 4/4 on Roger Ebert
$C: You mean gloriously badass
$C: Quite good CGI too
$C: Reminds me of something the dwarves would do in The Hobbit movie.
$C: Because it's physically rediculous but the vision and execution are so well done, you can't help but but amazed.
$C: I love everything about this. Even though it makes no sense, it’s executed well enough that it doesn’t look stupid. The way the two guys bounce on their shields and flip into combat position is comic book levels of heroic and satisfying. 
$C: The people on r/India claim that this movie promotes Hindu aggression in India.

Watching the movie is tantamount to supporting Hindu fascism...
$C: You should watch what comes after that scene.
$C: That’s exactly what I would have done. 
$C: Really?
$C: I was expecting them to be the ammo for a siege weapon...and they kinda were,  but i expected them to koolaide man their way through the wall when i saw them bundle their shields up
$C: This is a maneuver known as "The Kinder Egg Bomb" and has been tested extensively. Anything else would just look silly
$C: to make it a little realistic, the movie shows some catapultees crashed and died. Wow, that scene totally worked.
$C: It’s clearly CGI, there’s no way those actors got that much air with shields that big. They were probably holding small green shields when they did that shot.
$C: They would have overshot then. That is them applying air brakes dude
$C: What was unrealistic is that they used a palm tree as a catapult when only a trebuchet could fling them that far as it is the superior siege weapon
$C: Yeah not gliding made this totally realistic..why didn't I think of this before. Wait!!! Lemme try this with my buddies :D
$C: From the movie perspective, they were improvising. In other words, they didn't sign up for this type of stunt.
$C: > stear

huh. Interesting
$C: Yeah,  let's keep the movie real. 
$C: You will be easily employed in Bollywood for your creative ideas. 
$C: They could with enough farts.
$C: I was expecting them to painlessly crash through the wall of a castle
$C: Ahahahaha! You should see the flying vehicle thingy scene, that was really good lol. 
$C: Baahubali part 2. Very popular Telugu movie. 
$C: Bahubali 2. It is on Netflix USA.
$C: Firstly this is tollywood not bollywood. 

It's actually a pretty good film, the first one is better though imo. After a while of watching bollywood/tollywood films  you start to accept the ridiculousness of it all and just enjoy the story. 
$C: Link for you: Official 4K original with submit -- https://youtube.com/watch?v=H9770lB6E2M
$C: Bahubali
$C: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4849438/

8.5 on IMDB
$C: I recommend part 1 of the movie as well. Both very good movies. Both are available on Netflix.
$C: It is on Netflix right now.. both part 1 and part 2.. very entertaining!
$C: Just a heads up: the usual running time for Bollywood/Tollywood films is two and a half hours. And they feel like they go for twice that. 
$C: This is the second part of a two part film. Name is Baahubali. It's a Telugu movie
$C: It's on Netflix.. watch bahubali first.. dramatic but enjoyable
$C: Apart from this freakish scene, this movie is very good. It has a very good storyline and character development.
$C: It's on Netflix. Search for Baahubali 
$C: Free on YouTube
https://youtu.be/H9770lB6E2M
$C: [here's the first one](https://youtu.be/a5FvgdI6h-c)
$C: You can watch both the movies in YouTube for Free in the Original language (Telugu) with English Subtitles.
Baahubali: The Beginning - https://youtu.be/a5FvgdI6h-c
Baahubali: The Conclusion - https://youtu.be/H9770lB6E2M
$C: There's 2 movies in this series. They both happen to have been put on YouTube by the film company for free. They're HD and even have subtitles.

There's a Baahubali 1 as well .....which you could watch too. 
$C: The Name.
$C: Bahubali the conclusion 
$C: Baahubali. It’s available on Netflix 
$C: Show nam pls

$C: It's Bahubali part 2, but you need to watch part 1 first (which is, amazingly, even dumber)
$C: https://youtu.be/H9770lB6E2M
$C: I would like to acknowledge and appreciate how beautiful it was seeing how you expressed your request so openly* and directly*.

* You could have easily just said what most others would have (e.g.- “what movie is this?”), which is very private/closed - due to not sharing why you’re interested to know - but instead, you first openly shared the intentions for the request, followed by the request itself (which was very clear and to the point). You left us with no possible chance of confusion with what you wanted.
Also, due to absolute absence of grammar (save the “I”), I read your post in a very monotonous robot voice, which actually made me feel more compelled to answer your request.

Unfortunately, I don’t know the answer (yet), so I can’t help you with your request. But you already knew my intentions behind this comment anyway, I just couldn’t be as clear and direct as you were (sorry).
$C: You should watch the part one first to understand the story. It's a beautiful movie. I loved it.
$C: Baahubali 1 and 2 are on netflix, I highly recommend them! 
$C: Lord of the Singh
$C: It's a two part movie. Baahubali 1 and 2. Its one of the highest grossing movie from India. Some scenes are really well done. 2 is better than 1 IMO. You have to watch one first as story continues in 2.
$C: Bahubali 
$C: Movie? It’s clearly a documentary.
$C: The Lord of the Flings
$C: This is my favorite movie; it's so over the top. Definitely watch both parts.
$C: Watch Baahubali part 1 first then watch part 2 or you won’t understand the story
$C: Bahubali (2 part movie). It’s available on Netflix.
$C: It’s in US Netflix
$C: Bahubali, directed by S.S. Rajamouli
$C: It’s a good movie. There’s two parts. Watch both. Though I liked the first over the second. I watched both. 
$C: Watch Bahubali 1 first it's it's pretty crazy as well
$C: fyi it's on Netflix
$C: Bahubali part 1 and 2. Very successful epic war movie of India. Especially because the art work and story.
$C: It is on Netflix. Baahubali 1 & 2
$C: Watch both the parts BAHUBALI / BAHUBALI 2
Both parts together has made a little over 33000 BTC asper today's valuation. Available in multiple languages. 
$C: Where would one find such a glorious tribute to the filmaking art? Netflix?
$C: Bahubali 2
$C: Baahubali
$C: There are 2 parts to this movie.
$C: I think you can find it on [einthusan.com](einthusan.com) . It’s official and they have subtitles. 
$C: Both of these movies are fucking awesome. Myself and my wife are obsessed with them.


BAAHUBALI!!!
$C: Bahubali part 1 and 2 tollywood 
$C: Watch Bahubali on youtube. It is available in 4k
$C: Using this top comment - this is not a Bollywood movie. It's a Telugu movie also shot / dubbed for Tamil and Hindi, but not Bollywood.
$C: It's on netflix. Bahubali.
$C: It's a two part sequel. Watch baahubali part 1 and then 2. They both are in Netflix and YouTube 
$C: you need to watch both parts in order honestly it is 100% worth it
$C: I hate movies like this.
$C: It is on Netflix
$C: It's actually a really good movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I honestly thought I would watch it and just laugh at how bad it is and I ended up being in love with it
$C: Lol what are you a court bailiff?
$C: It's on Netflix in the US. 
$C: All telugu movies dies crazy stuff like that
$C: It's available on Netflix
Baahubali2 is it's name.

$C: Please watch it when you are high 
$C: Kindly state the needful. 
$C: ITS SO GOOD IM NOT JOKING. I watched it for shits and giggles and ended up watching the first one too. They're on Netflix rn. The way they use CGI and stunts differently than typical blockbuster movies is awesome. They're super in to beautiful nature scenes and whatnot. I loved it.
$C: Its called bahubali..released in 2 parts..do watch it.
$C: Me too, I'd watch the hell out of this movie, was really disappointed when the gif ended.
$C: Bahubali2
$C: Dude, did you watch the movie?
$C: Bahuballi 2. It's 9n netflix
$C: Did you know a Trebuchet can launch a 90kg projectile over 300 meters?

Did you also know that, *fuck that weak shit*, a coconut tree can launch 6 men decked out in medieval armor, with a total weight of about 600kgs, into low-earth orbit?
$C: Wouldn't this be a treebuchet?
$C: The catapult shown here is a very poor siege engine. The trebuchet is the superior siege engine. This catapult only threw the men roughly one hundred metres, but the superior siege engine could throw each of them 300m.
$C: Why would they? This is clearly a catapult, there is no counterweight here to fling the 90Kg trebuchet nerds over 300m out of their hiding.
$C: 1. How is that a thing?

2. Subscribed
$C: Technically this is a catapult but ok
$C: No counterweight? No supports? That’s a casual Catapult. Absolutely disgraceful 
$C: Ah, so this is really how the walls of Jericho came down - should have known it was actually an improvised balm-tree catapult combined with a human/shield projectile. Silly Bible. 
$C: Isn’t this a catapult you heathen?
$C: Thats a catapult tho
$C: I'm disappointed. That was more of a catapult than a trebuchet and you know it. There was no counterweight for one thing, just a tension based catapult. Though, now I'm conflicted. If it was a catapult, how did it launch a projectile presumable over 90kg over 300 meters. Clearly movie editing is getting less and less realistic.
$C: That’s a catapult...
$C: Join /r/catapults we are better.
$C: [Here's my favorite part from it's trailer!](https://youtu.be/G62HrubdD6o?t=74)

I sure am watching this movie coming weekend.
$C: That's true, a real man surfs on his shield into battle
$C: I'm a physicist at the Pennsylvania Institute for the Science of Special Effects and Realism and can assure you that this is a completely accurate portrayal of the catapultic barrel roll impregnation technique famously used by the Romans in their assault against Sparta at the Battle of Gythium.
$C: Or...you know....you can freeze the gif at the second they land and see some archers got knocked out of the way without being touched.... n stuff n things...
$C: But also by how it is 🤔
$C: woah good eye^/s
$C: I'd like to see a gif where they land crashing a few meters after the tree.
$C: Let's be honest. Their shield physics are just as ridiculous as how Captain America's shield works. If vibranium truly absorbed kinetic energy, it would never be able to bounce the way it would among other unrealistic attributes like it's boomarang effect.
$C: Each of them got the shield of the one "standing" left to him. 
$C: Wait, this isnt real? I had no idea
$C: Just by that. 
$C: Oh is that the thing that's not realistic? 
$C: I studied siege tactics in school and gotta say this is a poor portrayal of the flying barrel technique. Judging from the angular momentum, the amount of badassery and the combined mass of their balls, the landing should've taken out far more archers than they did, maybe a chunk of the wall with them. 
$C: I was expecting them to roll down the ramp together.
$C: Obviously you've never read the Dungens and Dragons equipment guide. Everyone knows that tower shields can be set, blocking all damage in a 90 degree arc! They're just using their shields to block the ground and thus prevent the impact damage!
$C: OK so nobody gonna point out that the angular velocity of their human cannonball should have increased when they pulled the shields in thereby decreasing rotational inertia?  Super unrealistic
$C: And water is also wet
$C: That's the only way to tell
$C: Really? Thats what made u think its unreal?? 
$C: Thank you Sherlock
$C: really? *that* was the giveaway?
$C: Does this mean we have to move again?
$C: Baahubali 1 and 2 are incredible. Just watched them recently and was blown away.

$C: At a minimum the plot would be more coherent.
$C: *Shield barrel lands and guy bounces up to standing position* "My man!"
$C: Or at least Asterix movies
$C: Ron Howard:  "They were"
$C: Not nearly as impressive as a half-court shot though.
$C: whole point of a bollywood movie
$C: Damn. Yeah. 
$C: Mee tooooo! are we family now?
$C: You daydream about Indian fictional soldiers catapulting off a tree into a cylinder and landing in such a epic landing. Cause me
Too
$C: That's^what^she^said
$C: 6’ 5”?
$C: Does that get you excited? 
$C: Canadian saying.  East coast?
$C: And now so am I.
$C: These were the exact words that I said in my mind when they landed on the shield.
$C: The thing that annoys me about this is all those archers just had a ball of men flying through the air at them which shattered their ranks yet all those archers in the background don't seem to give two fucks and act like nothing happened.
$C: [removed]
$C: Satap bitch
$C: Me three lol I’d die if I opened up reddit and saw SRK but I’ll take Prabhas no worries
$C: Is this movie not a comedy?
$C: Yeah me too!
$C: Got to whitewash every fuckin thing, don't you? (*Not too serious*)
$C: Trojan Angry Birds
$C: It was a Trojan bird
$C: We offer you this gift of a bunch of men barrel rolling through the air at you. Happy Hanukkah!
$C: Imgur is leaking.
$C: There are palm trees in Troy?
$C: Yeah! I mean who takes in a giant wooden horse left at your doorstep? You leave something like that at my door, I'mma burn that motherfucker down! 

This is way more realistic.
$C: It’s shockingly available on YouTube... in quality HD too
$C: Any subs or voiced? all i found was hindu and tamil versions with no subtitles.
$C: Is there a really bad dub? Because I've never wanted anything more than that since I watch the trailer 30 seconds ago
$C: Then prepare to get sucked in to the glory of Indian Cinema. 
$C: I gotta admit... I'm impressed with the costumes and the CGI isn't terrible... I mean it's not up to say MCU quality, but they are getting much better!  I'm going to give this movie a shot =P
$C: Telugu is the Vancouver to Mumbai's Hollywood. Also I just made that up, I have no idea what I'm talking about here.
$C: Came here to say it's not actually Bollywood.  Wonderful movie, one of my favorites of all time and definitely worth a watch.  Love the first one too.
$C: Real question: do people just go along with this, like it's just part of the charm or is do they honestly find this believable?
$C: Why it is not a Bollywood?
$C: Noting like watching a movie that was dubbed from language you don't know to another language you don't know and watch it with English subtitles.   

...this movie got lip sync issues... or I don't expect this guy sound like that!.
$C: They all look like Bollywood movies. Can't tell them apart.  
$C: > Baahubali part 2

Do I have to watch part 1 first to get the plot ?
$C: I remember doing a check on this movie while working at the theatre one day, and this big buff dude throws an enormous tree log and it exploded on impact, sending enemies flying in every direction. I was so confused. 
$C: It's not a movie. It's my life.
$C: More important detail is that these are part of Indian Cinema. And when National awards are distributed they all fall in same categories.... INDIAN movies 
$C: "Mmmm yes, shallow and pedantic".
$C: together with 6 of my buddies ... ;)
$C: Was it Bajirao Mastani?
$C: You should read about the real Baji Rao, who was nothing in real life as portrayed in the movie. In a military career spanning 20 years he never lost a battle. I think overall he fought 38 battles. Was appointed general at age 20 and died at age 40-41. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baji_Rao_I?wprov=sfla1 
$C: May I suggest some real good movies? 

lagaan, Drishyam (Hindi version), Kai Po Che, 3 idiots, Newton, Gangs of Wssaypur, Ugly, Munnabhai duology..
$C: The movie is pretty nice too actually. It's about the heroic Peshwa Bajirao, married to Kashibai, but falls in love with Mastani ( different woman), a warrior princess in distress. They struggle to make their love triumph amid opposition from his conservative family. Furthermore the movie has Ranveer Singh , Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra who are amazing actors. Give it a watch if you want. 
$C: Maybe [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_5_BLt76c0).
$C: They would make an excellent neck brace for drogon.
$C: Is that what they meant about 20 good men impregnating a castle?
$C: more like when did it stop making sense
$C: Lollol
$C: You mean a super hot white hair lady riding a dragon burning 1000 ships that took a month to make isn't realistic , for shame 
$C: [deleted]
$C: This is not Bollywood, its Tollywood
$C: [deleted]
$C: Suggestions please
$C: Thats katappa already a legendary character thanks to this movie.
$C: He's going to die, become a fucking legend, or *both.* I'd be grinning too.
$C: He's smiling because Bahubali is finally exacting revenge and is fighting by his side.
$C: I see his face and hear “Katappa!!!!!!”
$C: Kind of disappointing I had to come this far down to find this comment.

BAAHUBALI!!!
$C: MAHENDRA BAHUBALI YANI KI MAIN!
$C: It really is. You can quibble a bit here and there, but I personally really appreciate the vision and effort that went into it. If you grew up with any kind of Indian mythology stories it's pretty badass to see it made into a movie :)
$C: Antaryudham
$C: [deleted]
$C: The MCU recipe?
$C: Cheesy is relative. That is Avatar level visual effects for them. You should see the Indian spiderman or superman...its like they cut to South Park animation randomly.
$C: They removed and re-hosted them for money or sold them to amazon priime/netflix since then.
$C: [deleted]
$C: This is Tollywood though, not bollywood :D
$C: This is Tollywood, not Bollywood. The Telugu film industry, not Hindi.
$C: u hwat m8?
$C: Bobs and pusy please. Sand dunes.
$C: > wicked smartly  
  
I love you right now.
$C: It's a disgrace that a lot of Indians think it's the best Indian movie ever made

Source: am Indian
$C: Serious question but... For scenes like that, is it viewed as some action-comedy because of how surreal it looks or is it "serious" ?
$C: It's also on Netflix (US, I'm not sure about other areas)
$C: Wicked smahtly?  I can't quite place your accent.
$C: That's some BS. This is not India's equivalent of LOTR. And not anywhere close. 
$C: Just grandeur.  
$C: Also available in Netflix for folks in US
$C: [gif starts at 2:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9770lB6E2M&feature=youtu.be&t=2h22m42s)
$C: Thank you!  Are you aware of any with English subtitles?  It's on Netflix but not 4K HDR.
$C: Thanks for saving us from watching the first 4 seconds of BB1. They're really terrible.
$C: Clutch.
$C: Saved
$C: Thanks!
$C: Congratulations! You just disrespected LOTR!
$C: Bananahammock
$C: You're the real MVP.
$C: Hahaha...that's a thing.
$C: isnt there a subreddit with crazy bollywood gifs? I remember it being super popular. 
$C: It's not bollywood, it's Tollywood
$C: Had the same reaction until I realised it was on r/funny. Where else would India's most expensive movie belong?
$C: kinda made my morning, won't lie
$C: Always expect the unexpected when I am in the scene
$C: They do, later in the movie.
$C: Me too :D
$C: In the sequel.
$C: Dhak Fhak ?
$C: And Justice League.
$C: And with less shaky cam.

$C: The real question is: when is Marvel going to hire a Bollywood/Tollywood director for their action scenes?
$C: That's exactly what my dad said when I had to stifle my laugh in the theater. 

...dad?
$C: Well in the Avengers, they have superpowers to explain it :P

I get what you mean though.
$C: Its completely less believable...avengers have super powers so its more realistic and believable :p
$C: This is like the adventures of baron munchausen level..

I think it's a level more ridiculous than avenger.  but idk.
$C: But these people don't have sci fi stuff in them. 
$C: And it's not so dark that I can't make out what's happening, oh wait, that's DC movies
$C: There is a massive difference. In Hollywood movies, a premise is set for the character e.g. spiderman can throw web but not fly. That premise is generally respected throughout the movie. In Indian movies, a fellow is a regular family guy in one scene and in another he can have his car jump over a passing train by jerking his steering wheel! 
$C: Except that it is. 
$C: uh...no. the avengers doesn't look edited and has all their perspectives correctly done.

and these aren't freaking super heroes. at least i don't think so.
$C: [Oh you ain't seen nothin' yet boy](https://i.imgur.com/UDdx7MG.mp4)
$C: Haha, there’s a lot of people bugged that at the point that tollywood really shines for Bahuballi, it gets tagged with Bollywood. :D
$C: Yeah but everyone is directing people to netflix and the hindi-dubbed version... so *technically* tollywood but bollywood-ized a bit too. 
$C: actually it was shot in both Hindi and Telugu
$C: After this scene there are 100 more people flying like this in movie.
$C: They already have.  See literally every superhero movie made in the last decade. 
$C: To be fair, this movie did borrow a lot from Hollywood...
$C: That's just twice. The trope is THREE replays. 
$C: Well I have watched Marvel movies with my family and they sleep in theatre. They only like these kind of films. 
$C: Oh, man. Immersed in Indian Cinema for the past year thanks to an intro from US netflix and I gotta tell ya we have a lot to learn, my friend. Their industry is crankin’ out great films and there’s some major talent that is woefully ignored here in the states. 
Why does barely anyone know who SRK is?
$C: avengers = bollyhood
$C: Nah indians love spielberg
$C: Mate, India is one of the largest markets for Hollywood films
$C: Shhh. It's okay. Let's rope in the goras first.
$C: A queue? Who you trying to fool? You're no South Indian. 
$C: Lol every time someone says it Bollywood, I have to correct them.
$C: Exactly! Gah. And everyone being directed to netflix to watch the hindi version. Also, be pissed why this is in r/funny. 
$C: I'm always amazed that slutty spy or brooding archer don't die
$C: Sanderson laws.
$C: Everyone takes batman trilogy seriously.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Oh boy second part is even better 
$C: small correction its Telugu
$C: They’re awesome!!! Loved both movies!!


$C: Correction: Telugu Bollywood => Tollywood
$C: It's just average at best
$C: Okay, the film is kinda "epic" (GOT style sort of), but it is in no way worth your time if you wanna watch something actually meaningful or artistic. It's actually feels quite improvised and is not really a good movie when compared with Hollywood's standards.

Edit: Actually, this movie is not terrible. The first one is though. 
$C: You don't say!!! 
$C: movie was fine
$C: JL was crap. Shitty buildup to nothing.
$C: Whole of Indian movie industry is directed by Steven chow 
$C: tried to watch the first one, by the time he grew up my eyes were hurting of so many roll-eyes... 
should I give it another go?
$C: Preach
$C: 90
$C: Or making the most down-to-earth and sensible movies seem like the most ridiculous sci-fi films.
$C: Agreed.  Marvel is basically an extension of Bollywood at this point.  It's getting really hard to watch. 
$C: exactly 
$C: what did you make me watch. 
$C: Both this video and the video you attached are not Bollywood.
$C: Oh god. I didn't even know I could cringe and laugh at the same time.
$C: haha this is actually from Kollywood. Got trolled a lot and became a meme at some point.
$C: I'm gonna be honest. Handing him the gun at the beginning seemed a little unnecessary.
$C: Apart from chiranjeevi sliding act, I think this finds a mention without fail. :D
$C: HEY!
$C: Oh man. Thank you. 
I got a movie scene I’d def add to that lol
$C: What are you talking about? They had a HUGE budget.
$C: 2nd..
$C: Plenty of recommendations in this thread to check out.
$C: check netflix, both the parts are on it. 
$C: Tollywood
$C: Because chain mail could be expensive and heavy? It could take a cheap mercenary years of wages to afford a full suit. 
$C: Who needs chainmail when you have these guns?
$C: Should I watch this I'm indian too still not watched.
$C: /r/shittyaskscience probably has a better explanation
$C: Not all of animation was done in India, some of the VFX was outsourced to foreign companies.
$C: Our coders keep working on LA projects up at night. Edit: am Indian. 
$C: They need to get the physics right (read trajectories/parabolas). 
$C: Is it that bad? I was going to watch it tomorrow 
$C: This guy Physics!
$C: Not lagaan, Drishyam (Hindi version), Kai Po Che, 3 idiots, Newton, Gangs of Wssaypur, Ugly, Being Cyrus, Munnabhai duology.. Etc
$C: Hollywood no, Bollywood yes.
$C: Premeditated my friend
$C: It is even better 
$C: Legolas surfing on a shield, anyone?
$C: Yup, that's the part 1 and this is the part 2
$C: endurance and dex tests need to be perfect
$C: or car doors, drywall, tables, and couches stopping bullets.
$C: He shat blood midway due to fear /s
$C: Thank you, that clip made my afternoon!
$C: These are some Tollywood movies, not Bollywood. Even the movie from the above clip is not Bollywood. It is Tollywood. These are similar movies from the same director.

 • Magadheera : https://youtu.be/plDUrJSUSbY

 • Eega : https://youtu.be/X57db38K0pY
$C: watch Eega and Magadheera
$C: Animals were definitely harmed in the making of that film. 
$C: Not bollywood mate.   
The title literally says it's a telugu movie.
$C: Chiranjeevi! He is a Telugu actor, really good at dancing/breakdancing for his time. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt9iKZu5rY4

Now his son is following his footsteps in Tollywood.
$C: Their entire movie proposal was probably just a stick figure flip book.
$C: oh shit... I don't even know what to say. If CinemaSins would analyse this, the counter would reach 200 within a minute
$C: Yeah... that's the unrealistic part.
$C: Katappa ne Bahubali ko kyu mara? Dekhiya aaj raat nau baje, sirf Zee TV pe.
$C: Not getting the reply unless you go "Aauu" in your post Mr shakti
$C: It was originally Tamil 
$C: It had far more action. 
$C: But...but...there’s “bali” right in the films name
$C: [Oh you ain't seen nothin' yet boy](https://i.imgur.com/UDdx7MG.mp4)
$C: Better CGI =/= creativity
$C: It jumped the shark here but this comes at the end anyway
$C: Thanks /u/Nicekicksbro. Never knew this existed. 
$C: **laughs in european**
$C: TIL: Tollywood.
$C: STOP SHOUTING and make a common name popular already, like “Indian Cinema”.
In the states we have Hollywood and that’s it - not Hollwood, Vancouver-wood (yes I know it’s Canada but lots of American projects are developed there), Orlando-wood, etc. It’s just a catchy name for the film industry here in the US. Unite the Indian film industry, just give it one name already!
Or not, whatever I don’t care. 
Just please don’t stop making movies lol
$C: In sharp contrast to Hollywood, where all physics makes sense.
$C: part [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5FvgdI6h-c&t=5648s)part [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5FvgdI6h-c&t=1001s)
$C: Watch the  movie its glorious. The theatres were full for a month. 
$C: Both the movies are in YouTube for Free in the Original language (Telugu) with English Subtitles.
Baahubali: The Beginning - https://youtu.be/a5FvgdI6h-c
Baahubali: The Conclusion - https://youtu.be/H9770lB6E2M
$C: Baahubali 1 and 2 l. Available on YouTube and Netflix. You won't be disappointed if you liked this scene. 
$C: Baahubali 1 and Baahubali 2. You would not forget these movies for few months. Ridiculously entertaining if you keep aside Physics. Its available on Netflix and YouTube 
$C: The absolute madman
$C: Yeah! This is so cool that he decided to join his cool enemies
$C: BOLLYWOOD AT ITS FINEST
$C: Baahubali 
$C: It is. It's a great movie.
$C: Baahubali 
$C: Watch the whole movie/series: Baahubali. It's amazing.
$C: If you don't take it seriously, it's actually a fun movie to watch. This is my favourite scene https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkgaUY3VJHY
$C: What is the title? I wanna watch this now.
$C: Some are, some aren't. It is a very mixed bag. Some movies that sound silly are taken more serious than one might think. And vice versa.
$C: Baahubali 2
$C: If it works for Colossus and Wolverine, it should work for a Halfling and a Dragonborn.
$C: They were taught by Haru.
$C: Lol.. Yes it is. But the physics and war is just imagination. 
$C: it's on youtube. 4k too.
$C: I mean like compared to the other Bollywood movies I've seen this is awesome. 
$C: It is on Netflix! Baahubali 
$C: This is the most expensive Indian movie ever made. Is not Bollywood, it was made in the south. Name is Baahubali and both parts are on Netflix. It’s great. Music too, that’s on Spotify ;)
$C: Just use this comment as a reminder to check it out. It's available both on Netflix and Youtube in 4k HD.

$C: Baahubali 2
$C: Well, it's the Indian movie (series) with the biggest budget and biggest CGI budget ever, I think. 
$C: It's the cleanest only if you haven't watched a single Bollywood movie in years. Production quality has improved a LOT. 
$C: Yes, I'd recommend the same. I watched them out of order too and it was awesome but you might be left wondering who certain characters are at the end of The Conclusion.  
$C: Jesus. That is some serious production. These movies look like a billion dollars

$C: This is tollyhood , its Indian but in Telugu language not hindi(Bollywood).


$C: Not Bollywood
$C: Tollywood*
$C: But this isn’t Bollywood?
$C: Tollywood*
$C: Pretty sure India produces the most movies annually?
$C: Has that distinction actually.
$C: It actually makes more movies than American Hollywood..
$C: Tried these.. - lagaan, Drishyam (Hindi version), Kai Po Che, 3 idiots, Newton, Gangs of Wssaypur, Ugly, Being Cyrus, Munnabhai duology..?
$C: We laugh the same when Wolverine suddenly makes his claws appear
$C: Don't think you been recommended good Bollywood movies ever.
$C: [deleted]
$C: main guy looks pretty dark tho
$C: Do you not see the lead in this gif?
$C: xD as an Indian these reddit comments by other nationalities about the silly scenes in our movies are funny af. 
$C: Wow, good for you. You must be a great person.
$C: Don't watch hollywood. THese people are racist as fuck. Support Chinese, Japanese, and good indian cinema.
$C: I was once punched. I never went out since. It fucking hurts. I don't know how people get beaten up and still keep going forward, how much they can take and keep moving forward. That's how body puncturing is done.

$C: if i know my bolliwood thats the beginning 3 musical numbers later and 1.5 hours he falls from grace then you have 1 hour of down to rags storytelling, but then thanks to the love of a nice traditionally virtuous woman he regains his might through combat total time 4 hours
$C: I only knew of two, Hindi and Tamil, but I guess that’s better than thinking everything was Bollywood.

More in general, I always remind myself that while most countries are just countries, India (and China) are a whole world unto themselves.
$C: Don't you mean Rambo documentaries?
$C: No love for actual movies from India?
$C: It's Tollywood...a movie in Telugu language.
$C: you must hate cartoons or animation
$C: I thought you guys liked crap especially in the street
$C: Ha ha I get it /r/sarcasm 

Have you ever seen the Adventures of Baron Munchhausen?  This reminded me of that.
$C: Was thinking the same thing, take any anime and make it rl with special effects. Bollywood!
$C: Please don’t insult anime lest I have to break my katana out to defend her honor. 
$C: Tamilian spotted.

$C: Regardless your movies are still garbage. Maybe if you didn't so desperately want to be white. Seriously white people don't like you because of hollywood propaganda  quit supporting them.
$C: Title should say 2nd finest.
$C: > Are there more action movies now?

A lot. Check out Salman Khan and Ajay Devgn for mindless action flicks.
$C: Bled due to friction?
$C: What's the trebuchet joke on Reddit
$C: Then try the movie Newton. It has no dance sequence, and is pretty good.
$C: What’s to defend? This is good stuff
$C: Sandersons law. Mutation admittedly is far too powered genetics but other stuff like serums and gamma Ray radiation and spider bites follow an internal consistency. It's the distinctions and rules that make superheroes fun. 
$C: "Chaaarge....!"

"Aye aye sir!" 

 chop* 

Twaaanggg!! *

woooer *

"WTF!" (collective)

**SLAM BANG BOOM KAPOW...!??!**
$C: > is just ridiculous 

lagaan, Drishyam (Hindi version), Kai Po Che, 3 idiots, Newton, Gangs of Wssaypur, Ugly, Munnabhai duology..?
$C: I think that's pretty much what the quality of Dragon Ball Evolution was, so I'm inclined to disagree. 
$C: That's 2 million in excess. 
$C: Bahubali 2
$C: You're in luck. That movie's sequel is coming out next year.
$C: Bahubali. Two parts. Watch both. 
$C: South India has five states. Two speak telegu and make tollywood. Tamil Nadu speaks Tamil and makes kollywood. There are the rare art films too. 
$C: Accident. 
$C: Netflix / YouTube
$C: U tried any of lagaan, Drishyam (Hindi version), Kai Po Che, 3 idiots, Newton, Gangs of Wssaypur, Ugly, Being Cyrus, Munnabhai duology..?
$C: Small Correction: Baahubali is not Bollywood. 
$C: The budget has gone up, so the results gonna be more lit up.

Speaking of Indian movies, which have you seen btw?
$C: They play in theaters in the US... 
$C: First, India has people that speak several languages, think India like a mini-Europe. Bollywood makes movies in Hindi language. The other prominent woods are Tollywood (Telugu language) and Kollywood (Tamil language).
Indian film industry is considered to be bigger than hollywood in terms of the number of movies released per year. 
CGI is used in movies sparingly.
Most movies are made to cater to the 'masses' with standard templates: antagonist, protagonist, two or three female leads with/without meaningful roles, 5 to 6 dance numbers between the lead pairs with playback singing, some action scenes for the thrill factor, and a comedy side track....
The movies are lengthier with about 75 to 90 mins.
Ofcourse, there are other movies of substance too, which are a minority, (which I'd say same is the case with Hollywood too).
Feel free to ask any questions.

$C: Xaxaxa typical americans
$C: Bollywood movies without songs is almost impossible.
$C: An orphan raised by his aunt and a slave in the kingdom. The slave is the father figure to the hero and they were best friends. Hero was made the king and the aunts son hated it so he ordered the slave to kill the king whom he brought up. The slave was under a vow and cant break it so he killed Baahubali whom he loved. The king had a son who looks like the king and seeks revenge. 
$C: Baahubali 1 and 2 l. Available on YouTube and Netflix. You won't be disappointed if you liked this scene. 
$C: Escapism from our poor lives with some humor and awesomeness 
$C: Netflix... Search for bahubali.... You can make a weekend out of it :)
$C: Bahubali 2. It is on Netflix.
$C: It's dope af too
$C: Nope, look at the beginning of the clip, the last guy on the tree was wearing orange pants :)
$C: Speaking vis a vis movies.. Depends on what sort of Indian movies you been treating yourself with.
$C: Baahubali 
$C: Movie is full of stuff like this, a bit potato quality but here is one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkgaUY3VJHY
$C: This is the 2nd part of Bahubali, I think it is available on Netflix.
$C: They really don't, this movie, in fact, has better editing than most other movies I've seen of late and that must tell you something.
$C: Baahubali 1 and 2. Watch trailers first 
$C: https://youtu.be/a5FvgdI6h-c part 1
$C: This is from Bahubali part 2
$C: Baahubali 1 and 2. Watch the trailers
$C: whats the name of the movies? i would like to watch them :D
$C: I don't think we ever had heavy mounted knights as the horses bred in India were slightly different. The Nandha and Maurya dynasties had light cavalry and war elephants as heavy cavalry, and the Satavahana armies had chariots.
$C: Shit add me to this list as well. Looks better than most of the shit coming out of hollywood these days. At least they aren't trying to pretend it isn't ridiculous.
$C: Baahubali 1 and 2
$C: They're made of Valyrian steel.
$C: Tuck and roll!
$C: But what about.... a trebuchet? 


$C: Watch any of the "Rambo" movies, same nonsense but just a little more subdued... 
$C: Well you know all these guys have gorgeous topless wives at home, but the main character falls in love with a woman inside the castle he just launched into 
$C: Baahubali 1 and 2
$C: Prep school for Marvel grade.
$C: Baahubali 1 and 2. Watch trailers first 
$C: Baahubali 1 and 2. Watch trailers first 
$C: O.o what did I just watch?
$C: They do. Netflix. Search for baahubali. I watched this in college and it's good if you can watch around the physics defying stunts. :p
$C: Telugu
$C: Baahubali 2
$C: Triggered. This is a catapult, the inferior siege weapon. 
$C: Baahubali
$C: It's available both on Netflix and Youtube in 4k HD.
$C: https://youtu.be/H9770lB6E2M

This is the 2nd movie. I don't see it having any cost. Is this the work of a region lock ? 


$C: Baahubali 
$C: Just read the top comments. Links and all are provided.

$C: Baahubali 2. It was released in like 3-4 languages with a dozen more dubs/subtitles. Surely English is there. There was even German. 
$C: Just read the top comments. Links and all are provided.


$C: Baahubali 1 and 2. Watch trailers first 
$C: Just read the top comments will you ? Links and all are provided.
$C: You fail to realise one thing....

This is NOT Sparta.
$C: Baahubali 2
$C: Just read the top comments. Links and all are provided.
$C: Once you watch both of them everything will become clear.
$C: Like you'd know anything about it.
$C: Yeah, Netflix. They have a decent selection on Bollywood movies but unfortunately I don't believe they have either Bahubali's. 
$C: From what I've read , recent good ones are Bahubali 1&2 , Dangal and Secret superstar.
$C: Also, the title is spelled wrong.
(Its)
$C: Depends on the movie.
$C: The movie is filled with "quick thinking" saves from the good guys. When his small army was outnumbered invading force ,  he ordered days prior  to  stock silk & lighter fuel , on the battlefield he **Shot boulders via catapult,  they were tied to the cloths dipped in fuel**

One fire arrow & they burned to death.



I'm guessing they went for the tree because it made a better shot , bunch of men forming a orb mid air,  I mean there had catapults right there , they were the invaders , they had the gear 

$C: Just read the top comments. Links and all are provided.


$C: Tollywood*
$C: Tollywood*
$C: its from an indian fantasy movie called Baahubali 
$C: Telugu is original
$C: Telugu is the original and you can find both the movies original versions not on Netflix but on YouTube for free though. 
$C: Tollywood*
$C: Eega
$C: These are some Tollywood movies, not Bollywood. Even the movie from the above clip is not Bollywood. It is Tollywood.
These are similar movies from the same director.

$C: There was a red pants guy on the tree,very end ,on left . Quick glimpse!
$C: /r/bollywoodrealism
$C: This is Tollywood and the sub mentioned is also full of Tollywood 
$C: Tollywood*
$C: You don't need a helmet when you got protagonist level plot armour.
$C: This isn’t Bollywood 
Tollywood has these scenes mostly and that’s what people make fun of on the Internet 
Bollywood does this also but it’s usually in films by this director “Rohit Shetty” but he knows what he’s doing and it’s what’s unique about his films lol 
$C: It’s a Tollywood epic

$C: Are you not ethnically the same? Like for fuck sakes you are all the same ethnicity.
$C: If you don't already know it, that banana video is from a show that parodies popular indian movies kinda like scary movies or meet the spartans. It was supposed to be ridiculous and funny
$C: Unless you  mean  getting better and more believable with the boisterous stuff of this kind.. You def been skipping the good movies.
$C: The damn thing is available FOR FREE.. IN 4K.. on YOUTUBE :D
$C: India has good movies coming out as well. Only that the boisterous and bad ones garner the attention the most.
$C: Youtube and Netflix
$C: [deleted]
$C: LMAO ive watched this movie before but i had no idea how stupid it looked until rewatching this scene LOL
$C: Your mom. 
$C: As an Indian, maybe represent and explain it to people yourself? 

$C: So are you Chinese? Or Japanese?
$C: or you could just watch before commenting, it's low budget cheesy but still good
$C: We are ashamed you are Indian as well 😀
$C: You can move somewhere else and stop being one eventually. After all, as a wise man once said - Patriotism is just love for real estate.
$C: These films are geared towards uneducated indians. They know nothing about quality. Most white people don't either. My advice to you is to watch japanese and even chinese cinema. Such better quality, better acting, and in my opinion the best story tellers. SO much so that hollywood rips off japanese ideas and stories. Sometimes directly some times indirectly. For example the Lion king, based on an anime called kimba the lion.
$C: Nobody cares...
$C: This doesn't suck. This is badass. 
$C: Cringe
$C: You can swear, don't worry.
$C: It's not a Bollywood movie, but there are actually several dance numbers in both this one (Baahubali Part 2) and the first one.
$C: Their singing is their flying to their doom. Spoiler they don't die.
$C: So is hollywood though. Look at beowulf dude was jumping out of water like a fucking a fish.
$C: If this was an American movie, it would be a cult classic along the lines of Sharknado. 
$C: Indians think of it the same way. Well, not awesome but stupid.
$C: Some nutcracker in the media actually said this, didn't they! 😂😂
$C: > India

> Arabian

makes sense, I guess
$C: This guy knows shit,y’all!
$C: If you were indeed Indian as you claim, you would have known it is not Bollywood. What sort of Indian does not know which film industry Bahubali is from
$C: This was actually awesome. 
$C: Still a better love story than twilight
$C: Jokes on you because I don't watch that shit.
$C: Never saw it before. Was glad someone posted it. Maybe you need to spend less time on Reddit.

Also, calm down a bit.
$C: When's the last time you've been outside?
$C: r/iamverysmart
$C: Same as not every movie from the US is a Hollywood movie, 
Nobody cares.
$C: "Bollywood" is interchangable with "Hollywood" in that comment.
$C: Nah. It just proves you meant to say that you can have marvel and other comic inspired movies smashing records WHILE making snide remarks when you see same level stuff from another country.

Also, you definitely are not interested in watching decent movies and are clueless.. cuz India has good ones too.
$C: This movie is the complete opposite. It will deliver what you're expecting 
$C: I doubt you have anybody in your circle to recommend you good/decent movies from India. There is plenty good stuff, but if people wanna keep talking abt the bad ones, not too helpful.
$C: Modern Bollywood music, or I-pop has innovative production and arranging 
$C: Don't be! Baahubali is a fun escape and the Baahubali character is one of the coolest protagonists on film.  
$C: > You know what I mean?

No
$C: U got any chill brah
$C: No. We cringe/laugh at it too but we give the makers a bit of "creative freedom". This movie is terrific tho. It's a two part movie. It's on Netflix. Try to watch it if you can
$C: You know Netflix exists in a lot of countries, right? And since this is upvoted in the thousands, I'd even venture to say that yes, a lot of people want to watch this.
$C: Remind me to never to invite you anywhere
$C: I mean I hope that isn't a serious question and you aren't really that naive. Do you believe that there is a human on this planet that was bitten by a spider and now has the abilities of a spider and puts them to good use by combating crime? 
$C: Come on, guy.
$C: Minds switched off long Back as opening credits roll in. 
$C: Are talking about the clip here or just every action movie ever?
$C: If you lookup, palm trees can bend to extreme extents and the director made sure that this is not a scene which defies any physics. 

So realistically, it’s possible. 
$C: They were so brave.  Not many men would dare catapult over a moat in spare-tire formation just for our entertainment. 
$C: Playing for the Yankees?
$C: 20 good men is all you need. 
$C: To shreds you say?
$C: They lost *the* Ser Twenty Goodmen? The famous game of thrones actor? I was wondering what happened to him. So sad that we lost him.
$C: Good thing they have over 600 million potential replacements.

$C: Unfortunate, I know. But we have 1,339,180,127 more of us! And condom advertisements on TV are banned during the day so I guess we'll make up for the lost men VERY soon :)
$C: Some are in physiotherapy now. 
$C: Maybe only a few good men...
$C: The lead actor changed 27 times that day.
$C: No good men were harmed during the making of this film.
$C: Would’ve taken some just 20 good men.
$C: Who ever survived to the last take became a star.. In India 
$C: Takes guts 😰
$C: According to the bonus behind the scenes. Approximately 1.5 times.

$C: Luckily there are over a billion of them. 
$C: Thoughts and prayers (to Vishnu specifically)
$C: Including Emmanual 'Manny' Bothans.
$C: billion more where they came from
$C: Lost some bad ones too
$C: Oh, please. Imagine how many extras they lost in this battle scene from [*Baahubali*.](https://www.videoman.gr/en/97937)
$C: Including one of the cameramen as the human-ball was approaching near the end of the clip. He stood firm for that one #RIP
$C: Playing for the Yankees?
$C: There are around 600 million men in India so I doubt they'd miss a few.
$C: 20 good men
$C: Let's make a minute of silence for those men.
$C: Good men in India only cost about 10 rupees so not a huge loss
$C: That's subjective, maybe they were nice?
$C: The hardest part was the re-shoot the whole first half of the movie each time with a new lead.
$C: They only needed 20 good men. 
$C: Playing for the Yankees? 
$C: They were pros, selected from the few survivors left.
$C: And trees. 
$C: Playing for the Yankees??
$C: They must not have been that good if they were lost 
$C: They do have many spare ones.....
$C: Probably about 300 of them. 
$C: Plenty where that came from in India
$C: They lost a lot of good shields that day.
$C: They completed that shot first so they knew who survived for the rest of he move. They're very considerate of continuity.
$C: And the women?
$C: They weren't good enough, so no big loss.
$C: But they gain a lot of pride and accomplishment 
$C: 20 good men?
$C: This is one of those scenes you film first and once you have a surviving crew, you work from there
$C: Not just the men... but the women and children too
$C: And a lot of palm trees!
$C: Bollywood is the new Indian population control.
$C: This literally made me laugh + sort. And I'm getting over a nasty sinus issue, so it was pretty gross. 
$C: Only in Bollywood is the movie shot before you cast the star from the survivors.
$C: It's ok, they literally have 1 billion replacements
$C: To shreds you say?
$C: They made who they had left greater
$C: “What? Playing for the yankees?”
$C: Yes, but they were all stunt doubles. It's not like they are Tom Cruise doing their own stunts.
$C: A lot of good buhddies.. 
$C: "One more victory like this and I am lost" - Pyrrhus
$C:  Probably 4000.
$C: Nah, probably just A Few Good Men 
$C: then they had to go back and reshoot the rest of the movie with the actors who played the main characters in the stunt...
$C: [deleted]
$C: Tollywood*
$C: It's not Bollywood. 
$C: It’s NOT a Bollywood movie! It’s a “Telugu” movie.
$C: They do to save money on filming. Which why thirty five million movie in India is more than 500 million movie in US!
$C: /r/bettereveryloop
$C: You do now my dood.
$C: Well he said "slick" not "sick". Soooooo
$C: *sikh
$C: Meta
$C: Hahahahaha 
$C: When you guys use the Sikh pun in relation to India, most of the time the post has nothing to do with Sikhs.

Just saying 🙃
$C: It was! Spielberg make not forget to call director and tell him it's the best!
$C: Sikhs are mostly Punjabis, you will see them in Bollywood movies as Bollywood is obsessed with Punjabis. This gif is from a Tollywood movie, they might have a Punjabi actress here and there, but in general it's got nothing to do with Punjab (or Sikhs). 
$C: In the clip it shows all the men, but the last guy is only shown torso up. When it shows them joining arms from the back, you can see the bottom guy is wearing red pants. When they make a barrel in air, the first and last guy are together. The continuity in this clip is actually really good. 
$C: Nope, second person is old bearded guy, and you can see he has orange pants right under his shield when you see their backs while still standing on the tree.
$C: Well he did hit the ground pretty hard. 
$C: You can see him with red pants on the tree.
$C: Haha didn't even notice that
$C: He changed it mid air, it’s Bollywood, although that is a bit too unrealistic.
$C: Back...and to the left. 
Back...and to the left.
$C: It was a coconut.
$C: It's already did, my friend. It's one of the top posts. 


$C: Wut
$C: What
$C: You need to watch Kung Fu Hustle.
$C: Play Asura's Wrath, it is the incarnate of dumb over the top hype insanity. The game *starts out* with you jumping off a spaceship in the middle of this massive fleet battle, hurtling to earth as you blow the crap out of everything DBZ style, and then punching a monster the size of a continent, and it only gets more insane from there.

It's also more of an anime then a game, mostly cutscenes and QTE's, so you can just watch the whole thing on youtube, though obviously that's not *quite* ideal. I'd also try to find footage that's from the xbox 360 version/play that version, as it has less screen tearing.

Finally, make sure you watch/play the part 4 Nirvana DLC. It's basically a story expansion/an extending ending, and while it was greedy of capcom to not include it in the main game, it's legimately *the* greatest ending of anything i've ever seen. 

If you've seen Gurren Lagann, it approachs *that* degree of scale and insanity in the DLC, it's biblical tier insane with stars and planets being *thrown around*. 
$C: You need to watch Shoot Em Up
$C: This movie does, unfortunately, take itself seriously....
$C: This movie takes itself seriously though.
$C: There's the catch. In Bollywood, this is completely serious. I'm not shitting you.
$C: Dude this is a serious movie in India.
$C: That's a new perspective. If the movie had not actually taken it seriously, it could've joined the ranks of Kung Fu Hustle and Shaolin Soccer. 
$C: Actually, the makers of this film more than likely consider it as a serious action scene. It's intended to be a clever siege tactic.
$C: It’s funny because in Bollywood this movie is touted as the highest achievement in the epic/action/adventure movie. It’s one of the biggest national cultural projects to date in India. 

They are basically trying to create a new superhero for the masses and they sublimate all their ethnic and national deficiencies into Herculean stunts and virtuosity of their hero. 

I’ve heard this garbage likened to LOTR, that’s how seriously they take themselves. 

$C: Kingsman. 
$C: Except this isn't supposed to be a satire. 
$C: > I love movies that totally don't take themselves seriously

Ain't one of them, unfortunately.
$C: This movie takes itself seriously tho.
$C: These are actually pretty serious movies though. 
$C: Machete kind of falls into this category. Danny Trejo using a guy’s intestines to rappel out of a hospital..what more could you want?
$C: You gotta watch Kung fury 
$C: I can't walk... They've tied my shoelaces together.
$C: Then you definitely should watch the movie.
 https://youtu.be/H9770lB6E2M
$C: It's the best kung-fu movie imo...not only the jokes, references or action is badass..but after watching for third time I realized the music in the flim is awesome too..
$C: Check out Hardcore Henry.
$C: Watch Endhiran trailer. 
$C: Shoot em up
$C: It's a movie about gods I believe? Like Zeus of whatever but Indian style so it would make more sense that it has crazy moments like these that defy normal human laws.

But it is a fantastic movie, recommend watching it.
$C: This is why I love movies like Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, and any action movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger. They're great because they're a little over the top.
$C: so, like Jackie Chan
$C: Its actually a very serious movie. 
$C: The funny thing is,  this movie was serious
$C: Black Dynamite, babyyyyyyy
$C: As with all Bollywood or tollywood or whatever indian movies, stuff like this unironic. 
$C: Then Bollywood is your friend.
$C: It's why the latest Thor was so much better thanost of the superhero movies that have come out recently.
$C: This movies does take itself very serious. As it is the case for most of them.
$C: Army of Darkness and the Evil Deads
$C: Old school movie by Charlie Sheen: Hot Shots
$C: Threat Level Midnight - multiple Dundee award winner
$C: Starship troopers
$C: Baahubali took itself very seriously. Trust an Indian on this one.
$C: oh my lord what movie is this 
$C: [deleted]
$C: India has multiple movie industries (Hollywood, tollywood, etc) so it puts out an obscene number of films. But unfortunately, most movies out of India aren't that great. A combination of much lower budgets+mass appeal (where the masses are *biiig*)+creative stagnation means that most movies are generic action flicks with scenes like these. 


It's getting better I think though. A lot more quality movies these days. I'm still unsure of whether Indian movies should stop with the dance numbers and songs or not. On the one hand, it usually breaks the flow and stuff, but on the other, it is pretty uniquely Indian, and it would be a shame to get rid of it. 
$C: Or [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=En_8UgGZXio)

I’d pay good money to watch Singham’s mustache fight Chuck Norris’s beard
$C: I wish I was 1% as cool as that, holy shit
$C: [Here's that last frame in case anyone is curious. ](https://i.imgur.com/IPPaYM5.jpg)
$C: Rofl my husband was watching this last weekend and I just started cracking up and he blushed. Poor brave guy to marry a westerner
$C: Is this stuff supposed to be funny or do Indians just suspend their disbelief for these movies? 
$C: Reminds me of early John Woo stuff. 
$C: r/bollywoodrealism
$C: Tollywood?
$C: one man's trash is another man's treasure!!
$C: The only thing that could have improved that is if he Rikered the chair, sitting down. 
$C: what i can't stand is that half the protagonists look like fat dads. beer gut, perv stache, rolled up sleeves. 
$C: [And this shit too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uytj1wpR-fY&app=desktop)
$C: [Nothing beats Robot Endhiran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFW8VjiZQ2M)
$C: LOL
$C: but why? why do they do this? it's absurd.
$C: I think my favourite part about this is actually the construction workers who are all walking independently in straight lines, because this is how the director needs to tell us they're ignoring the ongoing confrontation. Every worker is now in a determined state of transition, pointedly ignoring their coworkers, but definitely not doing any actual construction, that's for sure.
$C: i thought they were going to roll down that ramp in the castle,all the way to the commander in the middle
$C: Now that would be unrealistic
$C: Now I'm kinda disappointed that they didn't.  That sounds even better.
$C: too bad that it was India so no trebuchet is involved.

So uncivilized...
$C: The whole group weighs more than 90kg though.
$C: OH YEAH!!

...Someone had to say it
$C: And it's illegal in the United States.

$C: I read this in cr1tikals voice
$C: Yeah, not even Fast and Furious has peoplr fail stunts.
$C: Is the rest this glorious?

Edit: Well I know exactly what I'm doing this weekend.
$C: On Netflix! 
$C: Baahubali part 2: Electric Baahboogaloo
$C: OK, I just found out what I've missed for so long. 
$C: Wait Telugu isn't Bollywood 
$C: Man my boyfriend is Indian but all we ever watch is crappy Telugu movies. Why don't we ever watch good ones like this???
$C: So - technically Tollywood?

Or Hydrallywood..?
$C: As an Indian that movie inspired me to get muscular and fit. Goddamn I wanna be jacked like the main guy. 
$C: trailer makes it look like Indian 300.
$C: Booooop. Commenting to watch later. Someone could reply and make it easier to find. 
$C: Bahubali is a beast. My Punjabi buddy introduced me to this. No regrets
$C: So technically not a bollywood movie.

South Indian movies are actually insane, it's great. Wish I spoke Telugu or Tamil, lol
$C: Is that the same movie where they shoot a big blanket over an army and then burn it?
$C: It was the highest grossing Indian film of all time for a bit there.

I was living in Andhra Pradesh when the trailer came out, and I'm not at all surprised it was so popular. People were very hyped.

Also, minor thing, but Telugu movies, including this one, are made in Tollywood, not Bollywood . 
$C: Their soundtrack is so fucking good!
$C: "Popular" is an understatement. Why? I honestly have no idea :/
$C: Telegu and Tamil movies are always glorious
$C: I’m lucky that I don’t need subtitles cause I somewhat understand Telugu also my parents watched this movie. This movie is also the highest grossing movie of all time, ever, on the face of this blue marble called earth.
$C: Watching them now. Love it.
$C: It come in Engrish?
$C: We played this shit in the theatre I worked at for like 2 months because so many indians kept coming in to watch it. I was so confused. 
$C: What’s “Telugu”?
$C: Forgive my ignorance, what's a Telugu?
$C: It’s original language is Telugu but it’s also in Tamil and Hindi and other languages too I think. My favorite is Tamil because I understand it. 
$C: So it's Tollywood not Bollywood. It's important b/c Bollywood rips off movies from other parts of India all the time and there is a superiority complex surrounding Bollywood.
$C: Telugu? - had to google that!  3rd largest language in India.  
$C: Thank you so much for this.
$C: Thank you
$C: Omg there’s a part 1??
$C: Groovy
$C: Its one of the highest grossing movies in Asia. $297,817,436 as of June 2017.
$C: Added to list 😂
$C: "very popular" being an understatement
$C: Do I need to watch part 1?
$C: Saw the first, now I have to watch the sequel. 

There's supposed to be three of these movies, right?
$C: Watch part 1 to understand the plot.
$C: please tell me there is a english sub/dub of this i want it so badly

$C: Part 1 and 2 are on Netflix
$C: Do you need to watch part 1 first?
$C: Lol the movie is hilarious
$C: Please tell me its on netflix. (Part one)
$C: Been meaning to watch it, trailer looks awesome.
$C: I think I need to see this film.
$C: Is it in English
$C: Watch Bahubali 1 also.
$C: Then it is tollywood not Bollywood
$C: They had limited showing in my local theater and I feel like the entire Indian population in my town was there that day
$C: Thank you. This has been a quest of mine forever
$C: Telugu?
$C: Do I need to watch part 1 to enjoy part 2?
$C: !RemindMe 10 Hours “Btw, should one watch part 1 first?”
$C: I might actually watch my first bollywood movie.. that's amazing. It's like taking an over-the-top american action movie, and going over-the-top. I can forgive that nobody here seems to be pointing out that it's ultimately probably a musical with more dance scenes than fight scenes.
$C: It's good movie in India but some graphics are a bit over. 
$C: It has been translated to Tamil Hindi and more. I believe they come in English subtitles 
$C: What's this guy saying?
$C: Shit, part 2? I bet if I don't watch part 1 I'll be lost.
$C: Do I need to watch part 1 to understand?
$C: AKA not Bollywood.
$C: i watch part 1 and enjoyed it.  i've never watched a bollywood flick before, but it popped up on kodi and the imdb reviews said it was the ultimate bollywood offering, so i gave it a go.  glad i did and i'll definitely check out part two.

anyone going in has to let go of their normal hollywood expectations, and enjoy it for what it is.
$C: Will I be able to understand number 2 without seeing the first one
$C: It also plays in Hindi. We had this at a movie theater I worked at. A very interesting movie to say the least..
$C: Love your intel, keep it up
$C: Based off a True Story
$C: I know some of these words
$C: thanks! I looked on netflix and there is a bunch of different version. Any suggestions to which one?
$C: I thought it was originally in Tamil
$C: My guys at work told me to watch it.  I need to ! 
$C: I assume it's a safe bet, but this film also has crazy song & dance numbers right?
$C: They both are. 
$C: Both for Canada too for those wondering.
$C: > Bahubali 2

[It is on YouTube as well.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9770lB6E2M)
$C: Commenting so I too can see.
$C: Yes!!!
$C: There are two versions on Netflix, which version of these movies should I watch? How are they different? 
$C: I'm assuming out its sub captioned? Or did they fun in English?

Either way it looks rather entertaining!
$C: Not on Netflix Argentina :(
$C: Sweet. Commenting for when I get home to watch it. 
$C: Wait what's 'tollywood'?
$C: So like anime.
$C: I have friends that love watching ridiculous indian movies, think singhaam or like a rajnikanth movie. Would this be up their alley and good for a movie night? I think they just wanna see ridiculous action more than   drama 
$C: So basically they just ignore physics?
$C: I don't see what you mean by ridiculous... I agree many Bollywood/Tamil movies are as they pretend to be a normal movie and yet have protagonists doing crazy things, but this is clearly a fantasy movie and the royal family at least seem to have superhuman powers. Even many of the other soldiers seem to have trained to beyond human limits. It's only as ridiculous as Hollywood with all the comic book superheroes.
$C: What is the difference?
$C: But what if we want to enjoy the ridiculousness?
$C: > you start to accept the ridiculousness of it all

See, for Hollywood movies, I might have to accept the ridiculousness. But every clip I've seen of an insane Indian action movie, everyone looks like they know it's ridiculous but still is 120% on board. It's so cool, because you get that sense of childlike awe from the sheer stupidity-awesomeness. 
$C: This movie actually looks very charming.  reminds me of those mystical kung fu movies like crouching tiger hidden dragon where they run on top of trees.  
$C: I watched the first one last night and I loved it. I have a question I hope you can answer:

The filmmakers seemed very adamant about making it clear to the audience that no animals were harmed during the making of the film, to the point where any scene including a CGI animal, it actually says "C.G.I." on the bottom left portion of the screen.

Do you know why that is?
$C: I can only assume the story is just as ludicrous as the visuals, or it’s very basic. Can I get a TLDW of the story?
$C: So do they all cast northerners then? Because these do not look like South Indians.
$C: Same shit, it's better being universal and just saying Bollywood. Otherwise you would she to include the rest of the languages in India too... Tollywood mollywood 
$C: Wait what story? Indian movies these days are just a piece of shit except some Amir Khan's movies. 
$C: Just finished number one. I havent been in complete awe and glued to my seat like that since seeing Avatar for the first time in Imax. The scenery and music was incredible. 
$C: Bahubali the concussion
$C: Not yet it's been added to my list been working 
$C: Just finished the 1st ... good stuff gonna watch the 2nd tomorrow for sure
$C: They've already gone to the moon and back. Because they are soldiers so they kept it low key.
$C: Palm tree?
$C: r/Coconuttreememes
$C: It's a palm tree my friend and for clarification it's a tollywood movie, as a person born in Hyderabad had to do this!!
$C: Unsubscribe from Trebuchet Facts.
$C: Fuck, I haven't laughed that hard in a while. +1
$C: I would say this looks more of the Ancient Rome era rather than medieval 
$C: Has to be one of those fully organic 🌴 
$C: Hi. I would like to subscribe to Trebuchet Facts!

$C: No that would involve weights. What you see in the video is a catapalm.

$C: [Somebody punched a bicep with a chained fist.](https://youtu.be/G62HrubdD6o?t=101)

How rad is that.
$C: DC Could learn a thing or three from this trailer...also probably from everything else.
$C: I love that the sequel's sub name is just "The Conclusion". It's very no bullshit.
$C: I feel like I don’t even need to see a version dubbed into English. 
$C: That shield kick tho
$C: His hair is glorious.
$C: This actually looks like an awesome movie 
$C: Im just replying so I can watch it later after work
$C: Is there a way I can watch an english subtitled version of the movie
$C: That actually looked badass.

$C: Ahh the one thread mistimed_glimli can’t enter...
$C: I really don't know how or why but I read that as "a real man surfs his head on shield into battle". Then I pictured that in my mind.
$C: A real *elf*, my friend
$C: As a historian, this checks out. Most such battles have evidence of them lying around, but since this one doesn't it's likely the work of the Illuminati.
$C: ...do I google or is this guy for realz? Dilemma, dilemma...

$C: you mean like a lot of movies from everywhere
$C: That was just resonant badassitude waves
$C: I dont think he gets that we already know it looks bad... 
$C: Well obviously the rim of the shield isn’t vibratium. Probably just normal metal fitted around the indestructible disk. That way it can bounce and they can adjust the grip without trying to drill a hole in indestructible metal. 
$C: I have gotten soo many comments like this one to the point where i dunno if it's sarcasm or people really think im an idiot.
$C: Nah, it's actually how the shield barrel scattered on impact.  A shield barrel launch in real life will cause all the participants to scatter forward, not sideway.
$C: Nah it's because they didn't actually have cameras in those days. Didn't you know that?
$C: Kick ass reference man!

**BAHU BAHU BAHU BAHUBALI!**

$C: The thing that annoys me is that this film is too realistic it's like watching a documentary.

$C: No, but some of the action scenes are extreme to the point they become silly. It's more of a drama/epic outside of those moments. 
$C: Well *obviously* this movie is trying to correct the whitewashed image of Ancient Greece
$C: Did you just assume the Trojans' race?
$C: Not after the Greeks got through with it. 
$C: Most of the Indian movies are on YouTube but region restricted and not available in India. Just need a vpn to watch it.
$C: Only part 1.
$C: Subtitles are there for the original version.

Both in 4K with Subs.

Bahubali 1: https://youtu.be/a5FvgdI6h-c

Bahubali 2: https://youtu.be/H9770lB6E2M

$C: It's much better than superman's CGI mouth. 
$C: By Telugu they mean the language, Telugu
$C: Well whatever you just said... It sounded right enough, and Im gonna agree
$C: Seems legit. I'll believe it.
$C: The best part is, had you not revealed you were making things up, most people would have believed you.
$C: Vancouver supports Hollywood though, doesn't compete. 
$C: LMAO....
$C: Is bollywood a genre or a studio? I barely know anything about all this besides cheesy, crazy indian movie = bollywood, so excuse the ignorance.
$C: It is hard to explain... Even within the universe of these movies, the characters who do such stunts are supposed to be extraordinary. In many fight scenes you will see the bad guys being stunned and it is a thin line between being over the top and being serious. Sometimes soon after a goofy fight, they cut to an emotional scene with the hero and somehow in the realm of Indian movies, this works. When I watch Hollywood/international movies, the consistent tone of the movie works on me too. I guess it is just about conditioning. If you are used to these movies, it won't feel so out of place. Nobody believes that this is for real but nobody is trying hard not to.
$C: Do you find the Avengers, LotR, GoT believable? 
$C: Nope, it is only believable as a comic book movie. This would be like believing in Superman. It is just an exaggerated fantasy story
$C: Can superman make time go backwards by flying around the earth super fast and changing its rotation? 

It's kinda all part of the fun.
$C: Yes. I was the old man in that scene.
$C: In India nobody goes to see realism. Most of their reality sucks. Most People look weak, malnourished, poor, and constantly worried to make ends meet. They watch such movies to get out of their painful reality. Those who have most of their needs fulfilled are those who appreciate movies that show the sad realism in movies. So it not like one size fits all. 
$C: Bollywood is generally used to refer to movies produced in the Mumbai region. Telugu and Tamil movies are a separate industry. 
$C: It's from Tollywood 
$C: Because it is not a hindi movie made in Mumbai/once Bombay
$C: Think of Mumbai/Bombay as the Indian Hollywood, hence the name Bollywood.

Telegu and Tamil movies on the other hand, come from different regions of India, that speak different languages, and are therefore part of different movie industries.
$C: Bollywood is the term for the Hindi language film industry and Tollywood is the term for the Telugu film industry. 
Both are based in India hence the confusion, but generally speaking Tollywood is know for most of these physics defying scenes. 

While Bollywood has its own set of problems you usually won't see this kind of stuff; which is why Bollywood and Tollywood action movies look very different. 

 
$C: I would suggest it. They're both really good (I normally hate Bollywood and tollywood mainstream movies, which is what this is- I would suggest some independent films instead from India) but it was really enjoyable.
$C: Part 1 has a war scene which is good but plot might seem overstretched, if you read 1st part's plot on Wikipedia or something and can just skip to the second part. Part 1's first half will be interesting, but the second half is a huge drag.
$C: It's a party!!
$C: Hell yes, thank you friend.  [Watch this and tell me you're not pumped up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_MyUGq7pgs)
$C: Not an SRK fan eh
$C: tbh , this guy would take down the dragon  if he had the right weapons . his strength is on par with the night king. his fight took down a 40 foot monument.
$C: more like when did it start making sense
$C: Only the first movie, I'm about to watch the second one now. They're both free to watch on Youtube.
$C: Wait are you being serious? Is Tollywood a real thing? 
$C: Must tell all white people
$C: THIS NEEDS TO BE HIGHER
$C: I would but not all are subtitled
$C: I am the greatest warrior this world has ever seen
$C: You can never understand the reason behind my smile.
$C: got em
$C: They don't have a global market like Hollywood, so their budget is understandably smaller.
$C: [it’s not that bad ](https://youtu.be/oMsECZ625QY) 
$C: It's not. It's called Tollywood (hollywood + telugu). Bollywood has movies in Hindi. India is quite diverse in terms of language/dialects.
$C: Bombay + Hollywood
$C: [deleted]
$C: Because Nollywood was already taken by the Nigerians.
$C: I think it's Bombai-Hollywood
$C: There are two different theories. One is that the earliest Indian filmmakers looked abroad at how other countries ran a film industry. They finally settled on Hollywood's model of using closed sets. That is where the name comes from: **B**ombay+H**ollywood**

The other story is that the naming trend started with Tollywood, the Bengali film industry (not to be confused with the South Indian film industry also named Tollywood, where this film was made), which originated and is based out of Tollygunge (Tolly rhymes with Holly), and the name stuck. All the other Indian film industries followed suit.
$C: The Indian media coined the term. It is not an official name.
$C: You tell me.
$C: You can feel the Bahstun accent through trees screen.
$C: 🙂
$C: Definitely the best CGI movie India has ever made. Come on man
$C: I did not believe you at first but then I looked at the Source.
$C: It’s not the greatest Indian movie.
But it’s the first major film in a regional language that showed film makers that CGI was and is economically viable. And the sense of pride in ones language and region makes them think this movie is the best in the world, when realistically it’s simply a pretty good movie with incredible CGI as compared to the stuff that this region has been able to produce.
$C: Could you recommend a couple of good ones?
$C: I second. This movie is a piece of shit in front of good cinema like Lunchbox, masaan, Gangs of wasseypur and the like
$C: Ikr. I hate all the praise it gets here in Bangladesh. I mean, I understand its *good*, but it's not that good.
$C: I agree with you fam
$C: This comment has been redacted, join /r/zeronet/ to avoid censorship + /r/guifi/
$C: That’s cause in Asia in general people want to watch 2 hour plus movies with romance action and music. They want to get their moneys worth. That’s part of the reason why American drama movies like Oscar bait aren’t filmed there that much but action movies are. 

Bollywood has some really good dramas that are Oscar level but they aren’t popular. Movies like A Wednesday which is a great crime mystery is a good example. 
$C: Its a disgrace to be a person like you. Encouraging hollywood movies is a good sign but not at the cost of insulting indian movies. 

You should be shameful! 
$C: It definitely is better than 99% of the trash out there. Indians don’t know what they’re saying.

Source: Am Indian.
$C: Or you know, it's entirely subjective and ridiculing the choice of millions is stupid to say the least?
$C: I believe he said biggest. You can't argue with numbers.
$C: Found the Masaan / Manjhi guy. I bet you are a Rick and Morty fan too.
$C: Depends on the movie. Here, it's supposed to be serious. Guess any unrealistic fight scene looks funny when viewed stand alone. After Agent Smith fight scene from matrix, there were so many similar sequences in movies, most of them ended up looking quite funny/weird.
$C: It's serious because in India people are pretty excellent at suspension of disbelief. 
$C: We have movies based on parody but not this one. If you've watched the movie in its entirety you would know the background of this scene and what led to this.  Don't want to spill any spoilers.
$C: Lol! This was sent like in a momebt of frustration when everyone else is downvoting such a good movie.  We indians cannot accept something which we call as our pride and dwell in hollywood mania.
$C: Youtube should give you english subtitles? Or try netflix. Thats your best bet! Or try youtube for diff language versions of this movie
Hindi/Tamil/Telugu looking for English subtitles. 
$C: Frankly! I never compared it! I was hinting that this is a truly indian movie at heart with good storytelling and no hollywood elements borrowed. Truly folklore, with indian kingdoms, sentiments, action scenes, weaponry etc..


$C: /r/BollywoodRealism

$C: Even so, it's not like there's going to be a separate subreddit for tollywood realism and another for bollywood realism.
$C: r/Oscars? Just chill bruh, don't take it so seriously.
$C: The gif here is the climax. They dance on trees in a song in-between the movie. 

Infact this event has more significance in the movie.
$C: And probably better plotlines!
$C: That’s the perfect combination because the protagonist will be an actual superhero 
$C: The protagonist has superpowers in this as well. Although it is not explicitly stated, the movie is inspired from Indian mythology with heroes who have super strength/magic etc.
$C: The main guy here is meant to have special  powers. 
$C: That's the problem you guys take your movies too seriously. If he can shoot webs, let him fly too. 
$C: The guy is like a demigod/king. Is it really any different that Captain America or Black Panther?
$C: My home town in India had a king 400 years ago who used 40kg spear for fighting. Spear is there in museum. Makes me wonder about his physical strength. Also this movie's premise is that the king is superstrong, thus named Bahubali "one with strong hands". 
$C: That scene in gif form. Hilarious. We should do a tollywood takeover. Everyone here would end up with hurting ribs. 
$C: I have to say, this style of action is fantastic. In my head, I know it's crazy and super unrealistic... But in my heart I love it and now I want to make movies just like it.
$C: No it's just dubbed. It's shot in both Telugu and Tamil but dubbed into Hindi
$C: It's a telugu movie with telugu actors though.   
Edit: and a lot of tamil actors.
$C: > . Their industry is crankin’ out great films and there’s some major talent that is woefully ignored here in the states.

Kind of weird coz a lot of people (especially people in late teens and twenties) basically think Hindi/Indian movies are not good enough for them and they only watch Hollywood stuf and listen to english music. 
$C: Lmao. Goras means white people, to those wondering lollll
$C: He isn’t Indian period. 
$C: While Telugu 4K with Subs are there in Youtube.
$C: I just want Infinity wars to end with a big dance sequence featuring The whole avengers/guardians/ant man/spider-man/Dr strange/star wars/X-Men/Disney cast. If we can get Duck Tales in there too, awesome
$C: You are assuming  that because it is "bollywood" , here the protagonist has superpowers
$C: This is mythology based. It's like how David in the Bible could slay 100s of people. They are basically super human
$C: Thank you :)
$C: Perhaps it's when it's Hindi dubbed I find it so damn awesome
$C: Tell that to Zod's snapped neck!
$C: Ayye come on..

Not lagaan, not Drishyam (Hindi version), not Kai Po Che, Not 3 idiots, Not Newton, Not Gangs of Wssaypur, Not Ugly, Not Being Cyrus/Munnabhai duology..
$C: Jay, the movie was definitely worth it. Think of it as comparable to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. He is supposed to be a demigod and the movie is meant to be a semi-fantasy adventure action romance musical. 
It’s a gem. 
And def watch the first one first. It was better than the second. 
$C: Watch the second one first. It becomes even more mysterious when you go back to the first one after
$C: 91.
$C: Yeah, dude looked old when the main guy's dad was a kid. Still one of the kingdom's most badass fighters.
$C: It’s not but who claims this one bc it’s fuxking classic
$C: better be poor and die of hunger than be naked and die of an arrow and possibly make the nation lose the war
$C: It's zabardast time pass, the reviews were alright. It's a two part movie so I suggest you do the binge. 
$C: It's treason, then.
$C: I have no idea what that is but it sounds like you are an FX artist.
$C: I wouldn't say "BAD"  but I felt disappointed, things TFA built up were dropped, things the trailer(s) did to draw us in were total misdirections, relied a little much on nostalgia again, a side plot in the film kinda leads nowhere except for introducing a character, and the movie ends with no real feelings of a specific direction.

By the end of it, I didnt feel excited for what comes next, it really just felt like Disney said "Yeah, we're gonna franchise the SHIT outta this" 



Good story for Poe though, if it was a Poe story, pretty good.

I'll admit one or two things that take place give me a bit of hope for what comes *AFTER* EP IX
$C: Not really. Anime does have a lot of interesting, slice of life stuff. Just like Bollywood, it's not always over the top action.
$C: I'll leave it there. 
$C: Comic genius
$C: You can see the moment where one's neck likely broken at 1:38
$C: So were people. A horse falling on you is going to suck.
$C: As well as people, furniture, windows, luggage, vehicles, and I'm gonna say some fruit.
$C: Kya alien peete Hain gae Ka doodh? Dekhiye break ke baad
$C: Nope. From Tollywood shot in Telugu and Tamil
$C: Agreed. I was stressing on the lack of creativity in Indian Movies.
$C: At the end you realise WTH am I watching..
$C: Welcome my dude/ dudette :-) 
$C: ~~Bolly~~ Indi ~~wood~~ jungle.  

###Indijungle
$C: I’m live in the bay in California and no that’s not what happens India. Bollywood said that they have nothing to with TOLLYWOOD and they look down upon it but then when tollywood started to dominate then they start playing nice because they want a share of the money
$C: Great. Now it's one more on this winter's to-do list.
$C: Thanks! 
$C: This is Bahubali part 2, both the parts have stuff like this and I think it is available on Netflix.
$C: Thanks 
$C: Plenty of very good movies out there. Just take a look at this thread. It's filled with recommendations.
$C: It is. Sort of
$C: No , I think its nigeria
$C: shots fired
$C: Seriously watch gangs. That's some Godfather level of storytelling & direction
$C: This isn't a Bollywood movie


$C: I mean tension between North and South Indians is pretty real.
$C: Dude I watch good movies , I don't care if Hitler made it 
$C: Good bot. 
$C: Yup close enough. Just add to it his death, 20odd years and his son avenging him(also having his own love story on the side).
$C: That's considerably better :D 
$C: lol
$C: Sure i like them too. The stories are often far more interesting than in the West. Hollywood plots are SOOOO generic, because nobody is willing to produce a "risk". It's kind of why people like anime i guess. The stories are often so completely different to anything you get anywhere else. 
$C: Aww yiss

$C: Me thinks, this was ironic...
$C: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sarcasm
$C: Am not advocating for the movies made here just trying to get the facts right. Coming to the quality of the movies There are particularly some great movies made in India which are better than Hollywood ones.. And you are right.. the ones where we don't want to be white and just what we are, are the ones which stand out.. 
Andddddddd when's Hollywood is going to recover from it's grip of fantasy movies? They are just crappy at the best.. 
$C: Fucking ace, thanks 
$C: Thank you, this helps.
$C: Yeah but that movie wasn’t fun while this one clearly looks entertaining from this scene alone. They didn’t go all out with the physics defying action like Bollywood does. 
$C: Give us an hour!
$C: i mentioned "indian cinema"
baahubali is tollywood iirc?
$C: When was the last time you saw an ad for an Indian movie on TV?
$C: [deleted]
$C: Lol
The fuck
$C: Soo, found out the movie is called baahubali, and it’s an action drama . . . so it’s supposed to be serious :/

I hope the creators aren’t mad that people make fun of their scene :/

I mean, move won accolades for their special effects, and this is from 2015.
$C: Wait a minute, Baahubali isn't Bollywood but....Tollywood? And why is it different?
$C: i guess you're right, like a split second of orange pant. also he has a sword instead of a bow and arrow.  
my bad
$C: I'm about 40 minutes in and Kattappa is so cool! 
$C: Thanks!
$C: It's called Baahubali and it comes in to two hour films.  I watched it on YouTube, for free, in high def with subtitles.  Baahubali is a Jain super hero who was said to have stood in intense meditation for such a long time that trees grew up around his legs and torso.  Some of the music and dancing was really good, though I am biased in that regard.  If you've got the time it's a fun thing to watch.


$C: Bahubali part 1 & 2, this scene is from the 2nd part.
$C: Wait till you watch stuff like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q38U54qpcF0
$C: Oh. 
$C: True, but STILL... 
$C: Thank you I hope to have a good laugh 
$C: saved

gonna watch this today after I come back from work
$C: I stand corrected
$C: That's weird, it says it costs $3.99 lol but that link works perfectly. Full 4k.
$C: You are awesome.  :-)

Thank you so much!  Can’t wait to see if it’s on Netflix.
$C: I did... got lost somewhere in the comments debating if this was truly Bollywood since it wasn’t in Hindi.

Thanks, though! :-)
$C: Sunova BB sunova BB a gun!
$C: They have both btw =)
$C: So instead of answering the question you say this?
$C: Cool story bro 😎
$C: Erm Frieda Pinto, Ileana D'Cruz?
$C: But, that's what it says. :(
$C: I've watched too many already, like hundreds.  Too many Tollywood, south indian, etc.  I missed this one as my SO watched it without me, I would never torment myself by voluntarily watching such garbage for 6 hours.  Life is too short.
$C: Open bob

Show vegene

Bitch lasagna
$C: Who exactly is 'we'. You Indians have no loyalty to anyone but yourselves, but upon hearing the truth, get all patriotic about the corrupt  smelly loud mannerless shithole that you turned your country into. Enjoy the cow dung outside your doorstep. :)
$C: lmao
$C: The fuck you sayin, bitch?
$C: Yeah that was dumb too but also it was animated.  Even that though isn't as dumb as a lot of the bollywood stuff that feels more like loony toons.
$C: Maybe I wasn't clear enough with my humor? I've clearly offended you somehow and I apologize. I was just making the comment that what I see in Bollywood movies are things I imagined as a kid. I wasnt degrading it. 

So come back down for me, and quit jumping to conclusions. 
$C: I watched some of the films that should be considered good. They wheren't.
$C: Dude...they are all just dance numbers... Get a group of random back up dancers behind the main stars... Fine if you like musicals...

Not so good if you are into serious story lines...

Bollywood is all about quantity over quality.  Take kabhi khushi kabhie gham.. Could be a serious drama, a real heart jerker .. But they screw it up by sprinkling all these Goofy ass comedic lines that are not funny and annoying filler musical numbers
$C: No thanks. I don't dig this type of dumbassery
$C: Then cater to the country that they're in. Shit man there is hundred of American movies and they are going to put non American movies on American Netflix?? At least have a separate category solely for Bollywood then. But no American is thinking of Bollywood movies when they think "Good movies made in 90s". .
$C: What? Next you're going to tell me Lord of the Rings isn't a historical documentary. 
$C: People actually believe the world is flat... so YMMV
$C: I heard the actors didn’t even use stunt men for it
$C: Actually this is CGI. They were wearing padded shoulder foam which was later digitally removed.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Jesus died for our entertainment.      Somebody needs to take over cutting the grass now.
$C: If it were a trebuchet they would've gone so much further...
$C: ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED, INDIA?
$C: they would dare to trebuchet
$C: Well the bravest man has to be the cameraman, first film the take off, then quickly reset the catapult, and race to em, and then catch them before they reach half way, and then speed up so he could shoot em before landing.
$C: I'd never do this unless they use a trebuchet!
$C: That's because a catapult is the inferior siege engine.
$C: Imagine if only they had used a Trebuchet.
$C: r/nocontext
$C: You put it in words so nicely.  I couldn’t come up with those words if I had to.
$C: TIL the phrase “spare tire formation”

I believe my Battlefield matches are about to get a serious increase in wins.
$C: Come on they would have never even made it of the tree😂😂
$C: "Spare-tire formation"
$C: As a woman, I saw it as a “cute bracelet formation”.
$C: Even heard of a device that could catapult 300m with 95kg of preload?
$C: Spare tire formation rofl I need this in TW
$C: Nothing spare about that tire, friend
$C: Trebuchet¿
$C: Catapults are inferior seige machines. 
$C: Should’ve used a trebuchet 
$C: I like that you said spare-tire formation like a spare-tire is a different shape than the other tires. 
$C: personally i prefer rusty-crowbar formation
$C: And then stick the landing so well.
$C: Trebuchets are the superior seige weapon.
$C: A Trebuchet would’ve worked exponentially better. 
$C: The rope was cut, 
Tree shot with force,
Included a condom,
Included a horse.

The men, not one, 
None strayed off course.
They put on the condom,
Forced in the horse.

They landed there,
The feed was cut,
Reddit upvoted and
Then busted a nut.



$C: The Indians.
$C: Yes, you lose good men to trades, unruly fans...
$C: The Nye Mets are my favorite squadron. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: BRING ME THE GOOD MEN STRETCHER BEFORE I PISS MYSELF!
$C: Chaos is a laddah
$C: You mean Set Twenty of House Goodmen
$C: Give me 10 good men and i'll impregnate the bitch
$C: That's what my mom said
$C: I was hoping to see this comment. Did not disappoint 
$C: 20 ~~fine~~good men sounds great
$C: >20 good men is all you need. 

Indian men are the best!
$C: How's his wife
$C: Nah Ser Twenty of house Goodmen is still ok, he would've survived the battle of the bastards I think.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Yes most stunt men in Indian train for 20 years before first movie. The stunt men train in the mountains and with best Hollywood company and monks to make best skills. Never hurt!
$C: Never thought I’d catch a reference to Robin Hood.
$C: I'm just gonna send it!
$C: Yay someone said it! 
$C: My apologies. 😶
$C: It's Bollywill.
$C: This title must have have set some kind of trolling record lol
$C: Yeah dood! Be like a Prinnie dood!
$C: Aww. I feel stupid now. 
$C: They are not even “Sikh” people though.. 
$C: Explain
$C: On Reddit, all brown people are sikh/muslim didn't you know?
$C: It’s not a good one but it is just a joke...
$C: Yeah this is a masterclass in film making
$C: r/MovieDetails
$C: This frame. [Far left, bottom right corner of the shield.](http://imgur.com/mUpeFLg.jpg) I think they are actually brown, but some of the lighting effects make them look red when they are landing.
$C: Good catch
$C: I expect nothing less from a good bottom guy. 
$C: Red pacts in pants can adjusts mid air. When he launch, in interview he say it was great thing to wear red, the color slow shooting of men in air for landing!
$C: Burst haemorrhoids will make your pants go red
$C: I'm trying to think of what this is from, but I can only think of deep anal, you gotta go to the left up into the colon
$C: **IT’S CG**

**VOTE TRUMP**
$C: So good
$C: Kung fury, too
$C: Shaolin soccer is great too
$C: Ah yes, the answer to the age old question "What if Chuck Jones decided to make a Kung Fu movie?"
$C: That's one of my all time faves. Absolutely fantastic. I literally cry when I watch it.
$C: This is one of my all time favorite movies. It's insanely bad ass on so many levels. 
$C: The Good, the Bad, and the Weird is another one.
$C: It is one of my favorite movies. The opening with the Axe Gang dancing and all really got me sucked into the film.
$C: Just rewatched it the other day. I'd say that movie is a legit masterpiece. It's incredible. Everything is intentional. It's hilarious. The visuals, the music, the symbolism. Such an amazing movie.
$C: See also: Kung Fu Soccer. I dont likesoccer, but that shit changed my life
$C: For such a goofy movie, the fight scenes are amazing. Definitely one of my all time favorite movies. Seen it a bunch of times!
$C: Kung Fu Hustle is all the proof I need to know a dragonball movie could be done well as long as it isn't taken too seriously.
$C: Shaolin Soccer.
$C: I tried, but it kinda didn't make sense :/ maybe I wasn't in the right mindset.
$C: Just watched it two days ago again. I love that movie. That knife-throwing scene is so. fucking. hilarious.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nb12zFUIWM

Although I have to say, I think the German dub is even funnier.
$C: Kung Pow! Enter the Fist
$C: Really, just about any Stephen Chow movie is gonna be good. I really loved Dunk Fu and Shaolin Soccer, lol.
$C: And Shaolin Soccer!
$C: One punch man is the anime equivalent.  As badass and beautifully drawn as the rest but silly as fuck.
$C: [Shaolin Soccer](https://youtu.be/I6_RC7QDspE)! 
$C: And Shoot Em Up 
$C: Everyone does.  I end up watching it every year and half or so for some reason.
$C: Took the words out of my mouth.
$C: I absolutely love that movie

$C: Didn't saints row 3 start out with you free falling out of plane?
$C: This comment and game are seriously underrated.
$C: [Block this](https://i.imgur.com/KENYtHk.png)
$C: Oh man, I love games who tried to do over the top stuff like that especially Japanese games who have the idea so ridicolous it's awesome. Sadly Asura's Wrath is on console only, but Metal Gear Rising and Bayonetta has the same feeling like that too which 2 of them are on PC.
$C: Dude Asura's Wrath is lit. It's got grand cutscenese and absolute hype bosses. It's like shadow of collosus, marvelous. 
$C: asuras wrath takes almost all of its setting, names, themes and concepts from indian mythology btw. 
$C: God Hand > Asura's Wrath. Not as much destruction but more tongue and cheek while being an actual video game as opposed to an interactive anime. Asuras Wrath still had some great moment.s
$C: > Gurren Lagann

Largest. Mechs. Ever.
$C: [I'ma just throw in this opening scene to my favorite ridiculous game](https://youtu.be/ZGTKftZnqAM)
$C: Asura's Wrath is an amazing experience and I am bummed there's not really anything else like it. Also it features some  [incredible music](https://youtu.be/-HYxNh1T8SM), including an arrangement of Dvorak's From the New World movement 9.
$C: Ah I didn't know about the dlc but that game was over the top and I loved it. 
$C: Do Crank and Crank 2 count?
$C: Two, count em, two deaths by carrot.
$C: Shoot Em Up had me laughing in tears when they jumped out of the plane and still shooting. One of the best action-comedies ever made.
$C: [Shoot Em Up](https://youtu.be/zV-nIlZ3XeE?t=9) - Red Band Trailer

Fun movie.
$C: I mean, it still can, their intent doesn't really matter if the product undermines it. 
$C: This movie isn't bad. It's an ok movie. I wouldn't call it garbage. And LOTR isn't for everyone. I can't keep my eyes open through any of their 12 hour long movies that's just about "Hey go find this thing. Oh shit! Protect this thing! You lost the thing. Go find the thing again. The thing saved the world!!" Or a long drawn out battle for some precious thing. 
$C: Just the first one though...
$C: It's called Aagadu  
And it's bad, even by Bollywood standards
$C: Basically every other tollywood movie.
Edit - Movie name - Aagadu
$C:  Aagadu (2014)
$C: Bahubali. There are two parts of it. And they were a glorious blockbuster of recent years. It was so crazy that the first part was re released to make sure people don't lose the flow when the second part came out (being just 2 years apart).
$C: good bot
$C: When I went to India in 2015 we watched the theatrical release of Bajrangi Bhaijaan, staring Salman Khan (I think he was one of the biggest stars in the industry, he was on almost every billboard) in Chandigarh. Sadly, it was all in Hindi, even the subs, so I didn't understand a thing, but the general plotline seemed to be okay.  I was honestly surprised, I never watched a Bollywood (or tollywood or whatever) movie before, so I expected something way more shitty, it was actually an enjoyable experience. It's funny as well how different the Indian movie going experience is compared to the west, here everyone is expected to be quiet and sit still in the cinema, there everyone was cheering and laughing and yelling at the screen loudly all the time


$C: Your point about the dance numbers is so good...the reason why hwood prevails my viewing is cuz of the continual story but sometimes i really like the romatiscism of fun bollywood songs but it comes at a cost. Ah well different moods command different content structure.
$C: >On the one hand, it usually breaks the flow and stuff, but on the other, it is pretty uniquely Indian, and it would be a shame to get rid of it. 

I think there's a balance to be found; I loved the way Dhangal handled the song and dance - it was either a montage, or actually explained by the plot. Minimal breakage to the flow.
$C: I like it. I actually really enjoy bollywood movies becuase they are so over the top and you cant find that anywhere. Its like those highquality gifs. They dont pop up much but when they do its great
$C: I would be sad if they stopped the songs and dances though I would be outraged if they got rid of the actors peeking out from behind a tree or similar. 
$C: At this point, the songs and dance are a cultural part of Indian movies and getting rid of them would really take away from the experience for many people, myself included.
$C: I've not even seen the movie it's from, but I keep listening/watching this dance number every now and then https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_MyUGq7pgs
$C: You can check out Malayalam film industry a.k.a 'Mollywood' which puts out a lot of good films, with only few mindless action flicks. 

P.S India is a very big country with lots of regional cultures, generalization are quite risky.
$C: You clearly don't know what you're talking about.... Of course there are bad movies in Indian cinema, there are bad movies in almost every cinema industry.
Instead of railing on about how you think Indian cinema should mimick Hollywood, perhaps celebrate the difference and widen your perspective.
You're wrong about "most movies out of India not being great", it's impossible that you've watched most of them. Just like you said there are too many in too many languages 
Watch a few more movies without this bias that everything has to be like the West and maybe you'll enjoy it
$C: Holy shit haha. That fucking look on his face!
$C: Not meant to be funny, but not really taken to be seriously either. It's more like "This is so fucking awesome, why nit pick over whether it's not possible or not?"
$C: You might not like it, but that's what peak performance looks like. 
$C: ...and yet they land perfectly standing up, while the 2nd guy has obviously changed pants while airborne, from blue to orange. Hmm.
$C: Yeah I was picturing it going down like the fat kid in Hook.
$C: That's what I was thinking too, since they landed in rolling position.
$C: palm tree is the superior siege weapon.
$C: Well in 48 States anyway
$C: [removed]
$C: Fuck yes it is! Watch part 1 first. I saw both of these in the theater when they came out. They're both on Netflix. 
$C: Started watching the first one with with my girlfriend as a joke, but we ended up watching the whole (almost 3 hour) movie. Kinda cheesy but man is it good. 
$C: Well, it's no [Alluda Majaka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRn1Kl_kke8).
$C: One of my top 5 movies of all time ... Also it's not Bollywood.  You should watch baahubali 1 first though.  I have 700+ movies on my home server, when I search by critic rating baahubali 2 is second on my server.
$C: It's a good watch. But would recommend watching the first one. Cos you wouldn't understand the movie otherwise. It's a continual story. 
$C: >Is the rest this glorious?

The 57 on Heinz ketchup bottles represents the number of varieties of pickles the company once had.
$C: It is glorious beyond proportions!
$C: Watch the first one first ... it’s on Netflix 
$C: One of my favourite films I've watched recently. It actually has 100% on rotten tomatoes but only like 5 reviews
$C: It actually is. Also keep in mind the main characters are like demigods with superhuman strength and all. 
$C: You have to see part 1 first. The love jungle awaits you.
$C: Part 1 was pretty tight too.

Source: am not Indian and hate subtitles and very much enjoyed.
$C: Watch the First and Second films back to back. 6hrs Nonstop Entertainment. 
Sure the CGI is a bit hokey, but so was Hollywood’s not to long ago. Treat it like the Animated parts of so many Disney flicks, it tells the story, and moves the plot along. Enjoy 
$C: The beginning to Bahubali 1 is just as hilarious as well
$C: How was it 
$C: It's the highest grossing movie in India ever (non adjusted to inflation though).

It did a box office business of around 18 billion rupees, most films are lucky to do 1 billion.

And it's actually a good movie. 
$C: It’s on netflix
$C: Its not bad. But its about 3 hours long. And you need to have seen, or at least have read a synopsis of the first one (which I recommend doing in lieu of watching it)
$C: I wish I could watch this but I just cannot stand subtitles and I don't speak this language.  The film looks awesome though.  
$C: i [found the first one](https://youtu.be/a5FvgdI6h-c). definitely watching this. the hair is glorious. 
$C: The rest is flabbergasting.
$C: Yes. Trailer: https://youtu.be/94BzBOpv42g
$C: Jam packed with action scenes and blood
$C: Yeah it’s like 50% awesome, 50% so ridiculous it’s good
$C: Should be on Netflix
$C: lol.. there's a popular saying in India, to watch these kind of movies you should say goodbye to logic and just enjoy the ride!
$C: Yes, and the first movie. Beat films I watched this year

Edit: best
$C: [I'm just going to leave this here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9770lB6E2M&t=2h28m)
$C: Baahubali 1 & 2 are some of the coolest movies I've ever seen.  I highly recommend watching them.  I believe they're on Netflix now.  I'm having a hard time finding specifics but I believe the first movie cost $28 million to make, I can't find a clear number for the second, so that price might include both movies.  It's basically a really long movie that they split in half.  But it's like a cross between Ben Hur and 300.  I highly recommend watching it.

I'll give an analogy: Remember when Chinese movies weren't very good, and suddenly they did Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle?  That was the moment that Chinese film making finally started to "get it" and make movies as well as the West.  Movies worth watching even if you don't speak the language.  Just get a dubbed version or read subtitles, basically, and it's still worth it.  Well, Baahubali is the Indian equivalent.  It truly put India on the map of quality film making.
$C: It's on Netflix too!
$C: Both parts are on Netflix !
$C: It is glorious!  Be sure to watch part 1 too.   
The adventure is non-stop!
$C: I'm not Indian so I haven't seen too many Bollywood or Tollywood movies, but this is the greatest movie of 2017.
$C: Let me know what you think when you done 
$C: [it's on netflix!, they paid $4 million to get this movie](http://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/bahubali-2-baahubali-rights-snapped-up-by-netflix-for-rs-25-5-crore-the-conclusion-completes-100-days-in-theatres-3914757.html)
$C: They break into colorfully orchestrated song and dance, I assume?
$C: Definitely gonna watch this
$C: It's on Netflix in the US 
$C: Watch part 1 too
$C: Got to watch Baahubali part 1 for full effect.
$C: Watch both movies they are top notch
$C: yes its great. i like the parts where everyone breaks out dancing in the middle of whatever is going on
$C: Watch 2 first! Its better that way believe me I had the same reaction after seeing the gif posted a few months ago
$C: This one is the second movie. Watch the first one and then this one. Both badass and glorious af! 
$C: Pizza, smokes and strippers?
$C: > Is the rest this glorious?

Combine the movie 300 with Bollywood stunts. You get this.
$C: Its on Netflix. Both parts. Its really good actually. 
$C: Yes.. Lol It started auto playing one day and I couldn't stop watching it
$C: You won't be disappointed.. also watch part 1
$C: The first half of the movie is. 
It so beautiful and fun and hilarious. 
Then there’s an intermission and it goes super dark and nasty :(
I’ve watched the first part several times. 
It’s feature-film length and comes to a natural conclusion. 
Just watch that :) 
$C: > Baahubali
I just watched the first one, it was awesome...will be watching 2nd tonight.

$C: This was one of the few scenes in the movie with bad CGI. Don't forget to watch it's earlier part, it's equally good.
$C: Full potential to become as widely acclaimed as Tunak Tunak and How Can She Slap.
$C: I've seen both... You'll see things that you've never seen in a movie before 
$C: may i recommend an old fantastic one? consider adding [the movie called 'Enthiran'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhF8h7x7Onw) to your weekend list (but find a higher quality version)

...dang... now im going to have to rewatch it this weekend too
$C: The original is one of the most epic movies you'll ever see. Makes LotR look like shit
$C: Yes and it’s on YouTube in 4K, official release. Baahubali is amazing.
$C: Cant be worse then 300...
$C: Not exactly related, but [here's the most glorious intro to an Indian music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIooFGRBZJY&t=20s) I've seen.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I think we used up all Netflix's licenses, I can't get it to load.  
$C: Dubbed or subbed?
$C: Bollywood refers to the Hindi cinema. There are plenty of other other languages in India with their own cinemas as well.
$C: *Dump him*
$C: Erm, Ma’am this too is a Telugu movie. It **might** also be crappy according to your standards. 
$C: [Yeah, it's called Tollywood.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_cinema)
$C: Well, the industry is not originally from Hyderabad to call it Hydrallywood analogous to Bollywood. It originated in Chennai (then Madras, British India). You cannot pick Madrallywood either, because the same city also raised another industry, Tamil film industry. Today that industry is called Kollywood, from Kodambakkam neighbourhood, Chennai.
Calcutta gave yet another big industry with the likes of Satyajit Ray.
$C: Gotcha bud
$C: I'm also replying to see this later if someone could reply to me so it's easier for me to find. 
$C: You know that Reddit has a save post feature by default... Right????
$C: No english subs?
$C: Thats it
$C: It do. 
$C: Language. India speaks more than 30 languages 
$C: Telugu is a language spoken primarily in the State of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in India.
$C: I believe the story ended with the second movie. 
$C: No. But you will enjoy it more
$C: I read on some comments that it is. Please check your local catalog 
$C: Yes.. it is a two part story.. Baahubali - the beginning & Baahubali - the conclusion. First is better than the second in my opinion.
$C: Yeah 
$C: Also Netflix UK
$C: Do you think I'll have need to seen 1 to fully understand the story depth of 2?
$C: They actually paid $4M for that http://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/bahubali-2-baahubali-rights-snapped-up-by-netflix-for-rs-25-5-crore-the-conclusion-completes-100-days-in-theatres-3914757.html


$C: whats the difference between the tamil and malayalam versions?
$C: Is it in English or are subtitles needed?
$C: Its two different movies. Part 1 and part 2
$C: Bollywood is the Hindi film industry based in Mumbai. Tollywood is the Telugu film industry based in South India. (Hyderabad, Telangana). Telugu and Hindi are different Indian languages.

Bollywood is mostly influenced by North Indian culture while Tollywood is influenced by South India culture

Edit- There is also a Tollywood based on the Bengali language, in the Tollygunge region of Kolkata, West Bengal. But this movie is based on South India Tollywood.
$C: Movies in a language called telugu. We have a ton of languages in India. Almost Every one has its own movie world. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_cinema
$C: Telugu cinema. Generally I find its more campy than Bollywood movies.
$C: It's like Hollywood, but later in the alphabet rather than earlier.  Totally different experience!
$C: I'm just gonna paste what I kinda said deeper in the thread. So, here it is:

I know that this might get buried under the comments.Telugu is basically a completely different language compared to the Bollywood Hindi. It is part of the unique dravidian family and is a huge component of the Indian diaspora. There is also a way different dynamic in them too. Bollywood movies tend to water down topics and concepts for their audience and tend to mashup everything they can into some performance. They will mix Indian styles with western concepts like love and finding yourself through trips and stuff like that. 

But the south is way more different, they take masala flicks to a whole new level out here, and it most evident in Telugu movies. A lot of movies are based on a powerful lead role and his antagonist villain, and war in between. Generally, the villain likes the heroine or is related to her. A lot of this is kind of borrowed from the Ramayana. The hero doesn't do much other than hang with his posse, who often has comedians along with him. But his interaction with the villain often forces him to take a path that is very dangerous. 

As a Telugu, here are some recommendations outside of Bahubali. I don't want to spoil it for everyone. So,I'll try to leave a sentence.

Varsham- A classic. Guys meets girl. Girls dad is an alcoholic and borrows money from a gangster for booze. Gangster wants the hand and the rest is all set in the rain. Pokiri- cop movie. Undercover cop goes into underworld to find a gangster and meets a girl in the process. Khaidi-1980s version. Another classic. About a rebel. Justice Chowdary- 1970s Indian version of Clint Eastwood, and badass judges. Alluri Sita Ram Raju- A story of a Telugu freedom fighter. Shiva-One of Ram Gopal Varmas first crime masterpieces. Magadheera- a more realistic version of bahubali. Also made by the same guy. Sudigadu- a non stop comedy. Jokes are everywhere and very direct. Gabbar Singh-For you Bollywood lot, it's dabanng without Salmans abs and more comedy 

If anyone has any more suggestions, just PM me. They are on Netflix and Amazon prime. A lot of Telugu movies are found on einthusan, a pirated service with ratings too and are super meme worthy.
$C: Telugu-language films. Bollywood refers to Hindi cinema
$C: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-origin-of-words-Bollywood-Hollywood-Tollywood-Kollywood-etc

tl;dr - Telugu language films made mainly in Hyderabad but the term originally was used to refer to Bengali cinema made in Tolly Ganj - a district of Kolkata.
$C: That is a really good question. There are a dozen of different woods in Indian cinema industry.
$C: A lot of Indian movies are basically anime, just google krrish
$C: I always thought that Bollywood would do a much better job at live action anime movies than Hollywood
$C: It's not to them same level I would say but yes definitely the second movie. The first movies first half is purely drama so I wouldn't recommend that one to them
$C: Yes in favour of crazy action sequences. However you could argue that Hollywood does too in action movies, just not to the same extent. 
$C: I wasn't really referring to Bahubali when mentioning the ridiculousness of it all. As you say it is a fantasy movie and so doesn't need to be realistic. Although I would say it goes more OTT than Hollywood films. I was referring to Bollywood in general. 
$C: The language essentially. India is a large country with many languages, each major region has its own version of Hollywood in its own language

EDIT: I should probably add that there are differences in the style of the movies too. Couldn't tell you what as my partner almost exclusively watches bollywood and doesn't like tollywood. She LOVES Bahubali though, and my kids seem to love the music for some reason. 
$C: Catering to different culture with a different language.
$C: Then winner winner chicken dinner
$C: >childlike awe

That's what they are aiming for. Indian film culture dictates that you laugh out loud, wolf whistle upon seeing the lead actors (yes,  even the man ),  tap your feet and throw the occasional paper confetti/money at the screen. Its wildly different from the reserved American setting.
$C: I would definitely recommend you watch the second one if you enjoyed the first.

The use of the C.G.I in all the animal scenes is a rule of the Indian Censor Board. Much like why they always have the anti-smoking at the start of a film.

Also an interesting tid bit that I learnt on my trip to India in October. Before all films in a cinema in India they play the national anthem and everyone sings along. 
$C: Law. People consider many animals sacred here (not just the cow ) , so yeah harming animals is a big no no. 
$C: Spolier alert! 
Right so basically 2 guys that want to be king. Ones a complete badass the other is an asshole. Badass named future king, asshole commander in chief.
Badass falls in love with princes from neighbouring village. Asshole also fancies her and tries to ruin it causing wars but badass gets the girl in the end. 
Badass told he must be Commander and chief if he wants princess due to wars. Asshole is king. 
Princes causes too much drama for royals, badass told choose wife or royalty. Chooses wife. 
Asshole realises badass is loved by the people and has him assassinated. 
Princes tells the people badass is dead has a child, the new rightful king. Does a runner. 

Bahubali Part 1 is actually based after this and is about the new rightful king finding his way home. 

$C: You do get quite a lot of fair skinned people in the south. It's just darker skin is more common. The main actor is from Chennai and he is fair.
I'm sure they will have used some northerners as there are southern Indians in bollywood movies too. 
$C: Well you are wrong, but that's OK everyone is allowed an opinion. Personally for me newer bollywood films are far better than the old ones. Although I agree on Amir Khan films, they are great.
I also have a soft spot for Alia Bhatt films because well... She's pertti
$C: "Low key"

Didn't realize this was a Bollywood Thor movie.
$C: No clue, but I want some Beer-Battered Onion Rings now. Damnit.
$C: r/cocofleshlights

$C: I know yaar. I was saying it's old school heavy armor - not kevlar and stuff.
$C: Ah, a fellow IIT grad. Shall we dance?
$C: They sure teach a lot of useful stuff in college nowadays
$C: I would like an English dub of this movie 
$C: I presume because technology evolved and it become possible to produce quality look without millions\billions networth industry.  
$C: nuff said
[Padmavati (trailer)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_5_BLt76c0)
$C: The catapult scene in the first one...OMG so epic.
$C: Here ya go https://imgur.com/WbONjXP
$C: [deleted]
$C: Lol I was gonna say. Better CGI than JL by a long shot 
$C: Yep, people expected a third movie after the first ones big success, but Rajamouli (director) said fuck no 
$C: Both the movies are in YouTube for Free in the Original language (Telugu) with English Subtitles.

$C: That only counts as one...
$C: Gods I was strong then!
$C: I killed fitty men
$C: I’ve killed Sixteen, Eighteen, and Cell.
$C: Username checks out.
$C: what is the name of said webcomic?
$C: There's a star wars comic like that too. It's fuckin' hilarious. 
$C: Didn't know that one, now I have look it up x) 

You should check [Darths&Droids](http://www.darthsanddroids.net/episodes/0001.html), the same thing but with the star wars prequels. Hilarious is the only word to describe it
$C: *Hylian
$C: Which is why it was entirely plausible, but it's fun to joke around about the sacred texts.  
$C: The way I figure it, it's not the fall that kills you, it's the ground.

So, I blocked it.
$C: Hello yes, I am Breath of the Wild.
$C: Elf
$C: As a time travller, I actually introduced this manuever to the Romans. 
$C: Wait! People actually did this?
$C: No
$C: Wooo^oo^^ooo^^^ooo^^^^oosh

$C: These men had clearly practiced this, you don't know how skilled they are.

You mean an incredible reference
$C: REVEAL YOUR REFERENCE YOUNG MAN!
$C: ^isn't ^it...

**Bhali Bhali Bhali Ra Bhali Sahore Baahubali** etc. (at least the OG Telugu version is) 
$C: They're on Netflix with subs and the words ABSOLUTELY matter. It's such a delightful movie! Set aside 6 hours and watch them both.
$C: [Apparently the official youtube channel of the movie has the subtitled 4K version of both movies.](https://www.youtube.com/user/BaahubaliOfficial/videos)
$C: it has subtitles, of course the words matter smh

$C: I'd pay for that boiiii
$C: [Like this?](https://youtu.be/QcpahQr--7A)
$C: That would be most hilarious thing. Jai ho...
$C: Just read this comment while I was at work. Could not stop laughing. I had to put considerable effort to suppress the noise leaking out of my mouth. Lol.

Just imagine Henry Cavill and Gal Gadot in their brightly colored costume dancing to songs. So Tollywood. 

EDIT: Got Henry Cavill wrong.
$C: Isn't that more or less a summary of the Adam West Batman TV series?

$C: This is what makes Terminator stand out. No fucking around.

$C: Ancient Greece isn't white washed, the brown Persians are the bad guys
$C: What do you mean though Greeks are white? Greece is one of the fathers of Western Civilization. What do you mean by whitewash. (I don't really know what whitewash means, sounds like taking something not white and making it white).
$C: then why did they did pick the whitest indians
$C: I can watch Baahubali in India, in 4k
$C: Part 2 as well. 
Both the movies are in YouTube for Free in the Original language (Telugu) with English Subtitles.
Baahubali: The Beginning - https://youtu.be/a5FvgdI6h-c
Baahubali: The Conclusion - https://youtu.be/H9770lB6E2M
$C: well i ahve a nice friday ahead of me, thanks mate.
$C: I actually watched both movies after I posted that... They are actually really good!
$C: Yes Telugu is Vancouver. Aren't you listening. It's the same way Swedish is Ohio
$C: Oh man, American here. Is that still in India? We didn't invade there yet, right? 
$C: BTW Telugu is the third most spoken language in USA.
$C: It's a studio more or less.  From my understanding after getting lectured by an old Indian man there are a few dedicated movie towns in that area of the world and the most well known is Bollywood. 

For westerners I think Bollywood has become synonymous with the entire genre but for Indians it is not (again, my understanding from a conversation with an older Indian guy)
$C: Bollywood is in Hindi (most popular north indian language) . Made for north India and Pakistan 

Tollywood (this movie ) is in Telugu a south Indian language. 
Then there's Kollywood for the people of Kerala etc one for Tamil people and so on. 
There are like 7-8 Hollywood type things all over India since we have no single language common to all. 

I'm no expert by any means but that's the gist of it . 

$C: Hm, that's a very neat cultural difference. American audience's are almost obsessed with continuity and suspension of disbelief, almost to the point where it get pretty nitpicky/petty. Indian audiences seem.... just more in it to be entertained, which I can totally get behind.
$C: No.
$C: That is such an oversimplified generalization of why Indians watch movies.
$C: What films would you suggest for someone who never watched Bollywood (or forgot the ones he watched years ago)
$C: It's a bukkake
$C: I don't understand what they are saying but I am so fired up!
$C: I seriously disappointed with this movie. Watched for action/war/drama but got a fucking love story.
$C: Deserves a place on every pre/post exam playlist. 
$C: "looking badass" lol
$C: Mate this is intense! 
$C: It looks animated? 
$C: This is the most badass thing i have ever seen in my life!
$C: If you liked that my friend, then you're going to love this. https://youtu.be/v7K4vGYL9zI. Same actor but different movie.
$C: > SRK

Belch....
$C: more like when did it stop making sense

edit: lol its supposed to be a chain but GoT fanboys are triggered.

GoT sucks btw and stop downvoting him
$C: Now you’ll know the answer to the question that vexed India for a long while - why the fuck did katapa <spoiler>!?.

No joke, that question became a meme.
$C: Yeah. Here's a list for you and scout's honor, these are real:  
- Tamil : Kollywood  
- Telugu : Tollywood  
- Malayalam : Mollywood  
- Kannada : Sandalwood (again, not kidding. the state is famous for its sandalwood)
$C: Yes pretty much every state in India has their own language and their own film industry. Bollywood is one of the biggest because more than half of Indians speak Hindi as their first or second language. 
$C: There's also Kollywood that makes a shit ton of movie. Ranjikanth from Kollywood is very popular in Japan. 
$C: Yes. Look it up. It's a 100 times weirder than bollywood.
$C: Yes. There are Tollywood, Mollywood, Chollywood, Kollywood, Sandalwood, etc in India. 
$C: Yes. Tollywood is used for Telugu films, although I've heard it used for Tamil films too. It has a heavy South Indian influence and is pretty different from Bollywood movies. 
$C: So you haven't heard about pollywood either 
$C: Nigeria has Nollywood, i kid you not. 
$C: Is that the true name or is it just a name so the rest of us semi understand what that place is? Sorta like how news media puts "pocolypse" at the end of everything to exaggerate how something is (usually weather)?
$C: Btw the film industry in Karnataka ( another Indian state ) is called Chandanavana which translates to Sandalwood. 

Link: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada_cinema
$C: Invalid excuse. 
$C: Learn the language. Subs are for pussies. 
$C: Like the plot even matters
$C: Who needs subtitles with so much action.. 
$C: These are the type of movies where you watch with friends and constantly share laughs and commentary, making jokes filling in your own lines to what the characters are saying. 
$C: Found you.... :)
$C: You enjoyed killing him didn't you?
$C: Please keep schooling these people
$C: [deleted]
$C: Exactly “INDIAN CINEMA” please
$C: [deleted]
$C: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nollywood
$C: I laughed so hard at this....bet movies are about prince's, scams and phone calls....
$C: That came after though
$C: Just because it had good CGI doesn't mean that it is best movie ever made. There are tons of flims in both Bollywood/Tollywood that had way better stories but sadly those aren't talked in the same vein as these big budget "action" flicks.


$C: Ok, you are probably right. But when the movie released people said it has the best CGI, Hollywood level. Then I saw those shitty CGI arrows zoom past the hero and thought how the fuck is this Hollywood level CGI. 
$C: Have not seen, Bahubali 2, but in my opinion, Makki had better cgi than Bahubali 1 and Shankar’s Robot. Was Bahubali 2 better than those?
$C: [removed]
$C: lagaan, Drishyam (Hindi version), Kai Po Che, 3 idiots, Newton, Gangs of Wssaypur, Ugly, Being Cyrus, Munnabhai duology..

Granted these are all movies that I've watched. Not an overall list.
$C: Gangs of wassypur is on Netflix in show format and may actually be the best Hindi movie ever made. 
$C: Generally ones without songs.

A Wednesday is a great movie. 
$C: North 24 Kaatham, The Lunchbox, Guppy
$C: Madaari, on Netflix.

Not amazing, pretty good though. 
$C: From the recent ones, i liked Pink
$C: Dude why can't you accept those movies weren't made to be blockbusters?
$C: I never said it was a bad movie though. It's just an average movie that is hyped up as the best movie India has ever made which it obviously isn't. I am not a hollywood fanboy who hates Indian Movies just because it's Indian. There have been numerous movies far better than this. The thing is even the producers know they make shit but still continue because it's easy money. The good ones always get overshadowed by them. 
$C: Randians are always easy to spot
$C: [deleted]
$C: > Youtube should give you english subtitles?

Doh!  That worked perfectly!  I never would have thought youtube would work like that with a commercial video.
$C: Are you trying to imply that this masterpiece DOESN'T belong in r/Oscars?! 

 ^that ^was ^a ^joke ^if ^you ^couldn't ^tell

$C: It was a joke....
$C: The protagonist has superpowers but not the soldiers.
$C: Oh, no, the arrow thing is cool af, it's the shield flying that seems a bit weird.
$C: I don’t think he does but what about the other soldiers that looked like they didn’t get a scratch after that fall
$C: Just the main one?
$C: Thor or Wonder Woman are probably better comparisons.
$C: well i said i don't think so didn't i? not like i watched the fucking movie.

and anyway, the effects are terrible in comparison. everyone here knows it, but somehow i'm downvoted.
$C: why is everyone ignoring my main point, which is my first point. avengers CGI is wayyyyyyyyyyyy better.
$C: Dude lmao is that the same film? Reminds me of kung fu hustle so much
$C: Oh believe me when I say that literally every Tamil movie has at least one scene like this. This isn't even the worst/best scene I've seen.
$C: Bro watch Kung fu hustle. Trust me
$C: i meant the language
$C: It's Telugu and Tamil. It's shot in both at once.
$C: Well, maybe they have specific tastes...ok I’m being nice, I really think they’re snobs. Saw some great films from Indian Cinema. Some stuff has to be taken with a grain of salt, know what I mean? Just enjoy, don’t try to take too seriously. But I’ve seen quite a few now and if that is how the truly regard their own industry it is very sad bc they are truly missing out on some fine films. 
Hollywood ain’t all that. They’re crankin’ out corny shit too, unfunny, overhyped, poor scripts, etc. There are gems out there, just like in Indian Cinema, but not everything is golden. 
$C: I'll just take the Duck Tales, everything else can go away.
$C: will do!
$C: Nice to meet you too Adnan. 
$C: I don't think poor people necessarily had a choice.
$C: Ok bhai abhi exam khatam ho re he 18 ko fir binge
$C: I'm anarchist what do you expect of me.
$C: Nope, I've dabbled in after effects to the extent of object tracking, never done intense CG work. Anyways one pattern in Indian Cinema (bolly/tolly/molly) VFX I've noticed is that they don't really get trajectories of objects right. I've made a [diagram](https://imgur.com/VBE8qk3) to explain what I mean. 


$C: Hmm, I may need to revisit my thinking and try to watch these OTT movies then. I gen steer clear of these boisterous ones while preferring parallel cinema, or the digestible masala movies like the ones I mentioned in my earlier post.

Btw, you seen any from the list?
$C: 3 hrs of awesomeness
$C: dude, but glad you didn't assume my gender. :)
$C: The fact that there are so many different industry names make this point obvious. They should drop the animosity and work together but alas the world is not perfect 
$C: as it should be.
$C: I got interested in your comment when I read a number of varying classifications. Which ones did you find a good watch? :)
$C: I have no idea what you're talking about. ;)
$C: I do agree with that. Not all are bad. Devdas, Lagaan, Chaundri bar, there is recent one it's caused a bit of a stir but man does it look beautiful, i think it goomber or something like that (sorry I can't recall, I do intend on watching it). Stay in touch with me man. I was raised in the west. You have no idea about this industry. First of all only two races exist in hollywood. Whites and Blacks. Look at the avengers do you see a single east asian or south asian person? Like what we can't be the leading men? THe movies alone are utter garbage. Thier are good films in American, but very few. Surprisingly East Asia to me is like the creative center of the world, everything from music to movies is so well done. Hollywood, loves to rip of east asian cinema and ideas. Now this culture in hollywood has ramifications. South asian men and east asian men are considered undersirable by the majority of females including our own.  Now this  does result in poor race relations, the overall public is unsympathetic to this fact. I would encourage you to boycott these films, you and your friends. You have no idea how important international revenue is. Most films fail here in the US. I myself haven't been to a theatre in 15 years, I refuse to support hollywood, and would rather, torrent or stream. Let me know if you want to chat.
$C: You can get further help on netflix and youtube where the movie and its other part are ready for a watch :)
$C: Yes. Baahubali is a Tollywood film made in the Telugu and Tamil languages and dubbed into Malayalam and Hindi. 
$C: To be clarify, they play the movies at the theater by my house.  I saw both of them there
$C: np. Glad to clarify.
Dance numbers are hugely popular, and these are the numbers that we (Indians) listen to...
A great % of the budget of the movie is spent on the dance numbers as these attract repeat audience (read 'masses' who look an inexpensive means to get entertained (and fantasized) after a days hard work).
Playback and original music composers don't make similar money as compared to US, but this is slowly changing. 
$C: I suggest you watch one from lagaan, Drishyam (Hindi version), Kai Po Che, 3 idiots, Newton, Gangs of Wssaypur, Ugly, Munnabhai duology.

You are bound to watch more (good) Indian movies after one stint.
$C: An interviewer just asked that question to the director. He replied that the plot was entirely different in that scene and they ran out of budget to do the action sequence for them enter the kingdom. So they immediately wanted a 30sec fix so that the movie feels complete. They were not hopeful that the movie is profitable because an big hit movie in India makes 2 billion rupees and they needed 6billion rupees to break even. Funnily they made 18 billion out of a single movie. 

This one is from 2nd part released in 2017. Its supposed to be serious and infact even Indians made fun of this scene. We cringed in theatres and closed eyes so that the scene would be completed. The creators don't give a damn. If the director was reading all these comments he would actually feel happy because at least everyone is noticing it for its ridiculousness. The movie is good though. 
$C: Different language. Bollywood is typically Hindi movies. TOLLYWOOD is more from the South. TOLLYWOOD makes movies in a language is called Telugu
$C: Bollywood is the industry which exclusively makes movies in Hindi, spans across many states in North India. Tollywood is an industry in a state down south called Andhra Pradesh, and the movies are made in a language called Telugu. They also have kollywood (Tamil) and Mollywood (Malayalam) in South India.
$C: Part 2 in also in youtube https://youtu.be/H9770lB6E2M
$C: Ok, maybe some scuffing, I'll give you that...
$C: Case in point.
$C: "Give a man a fish..."
$C: Yes.
$C: They are south asian
$C: I know. I hate them too. But once in a while a few watchable movies do come out. Movie houses here are too lazy to produce good original content so they keep making BS and their target audience don't complain so it's been a win-win for both. 

You should only watch selective stuff, like this one, Bajirao Matani, and Dangal has been one of the few decent bollywood releases recently. 
$C: Very eloquent.
$C: You seem like a fine representation of your homeland. May I ask which was the unfortunate country to witness your racist ass land on their ground. 
$C: Literally each one of us. Seriously fuck your face you douchebag tribal
$C: Did we find a weeb? I think we did 😀
$C: I don't think hollywood is the gold standard today. There was a time when you had great actors, great story tellers. Not so anymore. I haven't seen a new film in 15 years. I refuse to pay for it. I do have personal bias to. I am south asian, and hollywood only casts black men or white men.
$C: I am not offended per se, just was amused by what seemed a comment dismissing the entire movie industry as immature. You didn't mention anything redeeming either, so it looked very one-sided.

But if that was not the case, no worries. :)

And let me know if you are feeling adventurous enough to try out a  good Indian movie, and need any recommendations. Cheers!
$C: Name of the movies?
$C: Pretty sure "Bollywood" is also a category. And wow, walking around in a supermarket must be exhausting for you, do you know how much of that stuff is imported? 
$C: I hate to break it to you... There was no such thing as hobbits. The rest is totally legit.
$C: Lord of the Rings Takes place in the future, Star Wars is the Historical documentary
$C: [Just dug up the trailer, absolutely love this](https://youtu.be/G62HrubdD6o?t=74)

I know what I'm doing this weekend.
$C: [removed]
$C: Yeah I don't know I'm gonna need a source on that, buddy
$C: I heard the stuntmen didn't even use actors for it.
$C: And for a good reason, they run out of stunt men.
$C: That's why this scene is the first recorded shot of the movie. The actors who survive get to be the leading ones.
$C: r/manlymen
$C: For those who don't know,  CGI stands for Catapult Guys of India.  
$C: Holy fuck. Best comment. Also drunk. 
$C: Bollywoods secrets EXPOSED!
$C: They also had to use CGI to add those epic mustaches. Henry Cavill, take note.
$C: Oh my !!So clever ....
$C: Why would they do that, obviously they have this move down like pros, they don't need foam padding. Look at it, man!
$C: THIS IS A HUMOROUS UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE ACTUAL LEVEL OF POST PRODUCTION
$C: Thanks for ruining it for me
$C: >Actually this is CGI. 

Actually this is decent CGI with a real budget.  FTFY
$C: No shit Sherlock. 
$C: Something something can throw six indians a great distance etc. 
$C: don't worry it's all coming to an end... jesus is in fact is back... and the damage of 666 is far greater all over the world...
$C: Then they would have invaded north Korea. 
$C: A frickin' legend.
$C: The spare tire is the only one not being used by the car, so it's available for combat operations.
$C: Mumbai ROCKS! Mumbai ROCKS! Maharashtra!
$C: The *Hindustanis*
$C: More specifically tollywood!!! Not Bollywood.
$C: Indians flying bird.
$C: Go Tribe
$C: they are called the redskins
$C: [deleted]
$C: Sabathia and crisp was my two that I was angry about us trading.. We had a great team last year that lead to our World Series road. This year disapointed me 1000% more than last year..

$C: Wedding Crashers
$C: BOW BEFORE YER TROJAN HORSE REFERENCE! BOW YA SHITS!
$C: GODS, I WAS MEN, THEN! 
$C: Cayosh is a laddah 
$C: watched without subtitles.. took me many replays to get what he said
$C: Ladders are chaos, use catapults instead!
$C: Why he bitch? Because he say my people are best at movie? I think always Indian movie made fun because it's better. I talk to people and they say Arnold schwrzitnager say he want too work with Mihandir Zakrabar for next movie!

All Hollywood moving to India for best director!
$C: [deleted]
$C: To shreds you say?
$C: …holding up
$C: *a few good men*.
$C: It's being promoted on Netflix. Prepare yourself, the references are coming.
$C: We're men... we're men in tights
We roam around the forest looking for fights.
We're men... we're men in tights.
We rob from the rich and give to the poor, that's right.

We may look like sissys,
but watch what you say or else we'll put out your lights. (punch)
We're men... we're men in tights
always on guard defending the peoples rights.

la la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la...
$C: I haven't caught a reference to anything ever since I had my eyes gouged out with a spoon. 
$C: For ur, it's ok. I'm happy my Indian make other happy with Spielberg.
$C: It's ok. Reddit is pure ignorant when it comes to indian film industries. 
$C: Very much! For me when my people have taken fine to look at the great things we do babee! 

I have something!
$C: It's like these people don't understand the concept of diversity. 

It's called the Indian subcontinent for a reason. A Delhi guy has more things in common with a Pakistani than someone from Ladakh. 

Maybe it's too complicated for an outsider to understand, but then you shouldn't make uninformed jokes.
$C: Would You prefer a different Punjabi?
$C: Almost as good as the horse slide: https://youtu.be/JUi_gGZY2m0
$C:  I'd venture to say even rust, or orange. They definitely are more of an earthy tone upon a 2nd viewing.
$C: You're not at all wrong, but it was a reference [from the movie JFK.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MLc0udf_74) 

Edit: Added sauce link
$C: lol thanks I didn’t hear the first time
$C: [deleted]
$C: And the taste...

Strawberries.
$C: Black Dynamite, too
$C: This is the most glorious thing i've ever seen. Thank you so much. I have a new idol. HACKERMAN

$C: The soundtrack is awesome, holy shit.
$C: Whoa, your pecs are epic. 
$C: Kung Fury. Yes 
$C: Also Happy Feet
$C: Hardcore Henry
$C: The Hebrew Hammer
$C: Yea that movie is ass and the only reason ppl even know about it is because a bunch of ppl circlejerked it as a joke. How you can even say Kung Fury, as if it is even in the same vicinity as Kung Fu Hustle, is mind boggling. 
$C: Shaolin Soccer definitely needs to be up there, if for nothing else than [Sweeties Sweet Buns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtBebT-rKeM)
$C: Best sports movie ever. 
$C: It's a modern wuxia story with the sensibilities of a Looney Tunes show. It's glorious. 
$C: You are not the only one. Everyone is treating it as one of the funniest movies of all time, but I just thought it was a mess with a boring and random plot.
$C: I think that's mission 2 or the like. Basically you get framed in a intro mission...then jump out of a plane and steel some rich fucks penthouse. 
$C: As said below, not the intro, but Saint's Row 4 DOES have you disarm a huge-ass missile while its shooting through the air as it's intro though.... Also a batshit insane start.
$C: To "Power" by Kanye West, man I loved that game.
$C: C'mon bro, that is really tame for Saint's row standards

they actually do this

https://youtu.be/vBkCfVyYFdU?t=251

watch all the way to the end, then go buy this game.
$C: I mean, the intro to Saints Row IV is [riding a launching nuke.](https://youtu.be/nMX2hfYfeE8?t=596)  Oh, and you're the President.
$C: Doesn't Sonic Adventure 2 start out with Sonic falling out of a plane and "snowboarding" down LA on a piece of plane debris?
$C: Well... through a plane... 
$C: In 4 you free fall through a space ship while Stan Bush blares. 
$C: The game probably suffered for the fact that the final boss was DLC. 
$C: And he's *the first* boss. 
$C: Asura's Wrath is certainly more of an interactive anime then it is a game, but I don't think that's inherently a bad thing, it's insanely fun regardless. 
$C: No, he said shoot em up.
$C: Crank? Yes, definitely. Crank 2? No.
$C: Oh oh and you have to watch Hardcore Henry

$C: Push pineapple shake a tree
$C: where can i find bad movies like this ? i love them !
$C: [Here you go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhtn98Ilnk).  BTW, as is pointed out above, Tollywood not Bollywood due to native language being Telegu not Hindi.
$C: Fuck off bro...
$C: Push Pineapple, Shake the tree
$C: Bajrangi Bhaijaan is a surprisingly decent movie by Salman Khan standards.
$C: Not sure if you misclicked there, but the language is Hindi not Hindu.
$C: I used to work with a very patriotic Indian guy, who felt that Hollywood movies were nothing to brag about, and how they came nowhere close to Bollywood in passion and entertainment value. I smiled and nodded, but I kind of get where he was coming from. 
$C: I work in a part of Dallas that has so many Indian people that our local theater shows Bollywood movies. I keep saying I'm going to go check some of them out, but haven't made the time yet. It'd be fun to see one on a big screen occasionally.
$C: That's actually a pretty good one. I saw it two years ago. Most of the time, I think Salman Khan is a meathead, but he was actually quite endearing in that one. Was pleasantly surprised :)

And yeah, he's a massive star in India. For the longest time, the biggest stars were the three Khans (not related): Shahrukh, Amir and Salman Khan. They constantly compete with one another and everyone has their personal favorite. They probably are still the biggest stars in the country.
$C: The cheering is usually only a thing for the first week or so of a movie with a big star in it. It's fine when they do it for an action flick or something, but it's irritating during movies with an actual plot.
$C: Try going to a cinema in Harlem or Detroit.
$C: Indian movies can be really split. There's a lot that are just bad and are just there to kill time, but there are some very good ones that speak to cultural issues and go beyond being just movies. 
$C: Was everything throwing their chits and stuff? Go to an opening night of a big bollywood film in the USA and you can still enjoy the raucus theater experience hehe
$C: Bajrangi Bhaijaan is one of the best movies in recent times. And also Dangal(language: hindi), Arjun Reddy(language: telugu) , Premam( language: Malayalam). Dangal is on netflix. 
$C: >You're wrong about "most movies out of India not being great"

He's not. [90% of everything is trash](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw), and that goes for Hollywood too. The difference is India has a hundred times the output of Hollywood, so obviously it puts out more trash than they do.
$C: Ahhh okay got it, cheers
$C: Did you see that fling? He obviously just shit himself
$C: Can't be in Texas since I saw one at a grocery store last night.

Unless there is different kinds I saw a Kinder Joy egg
$C: Well that was fucking glorious
$C: I'm not gay, but that made me gay.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Some of these shots weren't even that bad.
$C: I need to watch the shit out of this. My god that looked legendary level awesome. I'm 100% willing to believe that happened!
$C: That was NOT an under-statement as I originally expected
$C: I love that he is a cross between Douglas Reynholm and neo. 
$C: It reminds me of that latest movie with wonderwoman when she stops that shower of slow-mo bullets. In the end western movies with superheroes do the same thing as Bollywood movies except that they give it a more serious tone.
$C: I don't understand how these movies aren't more popular in the US.
$C: His hair is beautiful
$C: Star Wars kid part 2?
$C: <3
$C: You know, I always had a problem with the last scene in 300 when not a single arrow hits them in their face but maybe it is fine....
$C: A bollywood Prince of Persia is missing from my life.
$C: This is the Bollywoodest thing I've seen in a while.
$C: That.. looks awesome
$C: Holy shit this actually looks done well. Normally the budgets look like they were paid by someone that stacks shelves
$C: That man populated all of India 
$C: I'd like to think this scene of the movie also falls under the [pretty crazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcoCjxCPhZI) category.
$C: It’s like a Crouching Tiger and Alexander mashup but 7x more glorious
$C: [How did you miss out on this insane battle scene from the end of Baahubali? It's even *crazier*.](https://www.videoman.gr/en/97937)
$C: Reminded me of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0XOjEah6E8).
$C: "Here you go, innocent bystanders to a scene of battle. Have some fruit."
$C: The cgi is pretty good for a bollywood movie
$C: If this was in a western movie, it would just be classified as bad ass. 
$C: I'm impressed. 
$C: Well it's just like AAA chinese kung fu movies now with a bit of indian crazy. The CGI seems perfect. A good time to be alive!
$C: Typical Genji...
$C: Somehow Bollywood manages to be more anime than anime itself
$C: Basically if you replace his sword with a lightsaber and the arrows with laser blasts, what you've got in that scene is a Jedi fighting a bunch of Stormtroopers. And they shot it rather well too. This is great.
$C: This has gotta be the same folks that did the giant flying flaming tarp scene...
$C: Specially if you’re interested in learning archery!

https://youtu.be/nKL75628ubA
$C: Can you imagine how fast that dude had to move in order to spin around and deflect all those arrows lol

Edit: Never mind, I just realized that's exactly what the scene was supposed to convey..
$C: “Interest of 21st century YouTube channel”

lmao
$C: That hair was glorious. 
$C: Dude has skills.
$C: That's some storm trooper grade aim they got there. I can just imagine this scene actually happening and he hits like 3 arrows as a fluke but get's completely covered in arrows.
$C: I would totally watch this.
$C: Thank you. Money and time well spent. 
$C: Damnnn Chick norris dont got shit on him.
$C: Is this the Last Jedi trailer?
$C: Right... I know what I'm watching this weekend.
I need 13,000 CCs of popcorn, STAT!
$C: Indians are Jedi


*Confirmed*
$C: I feel like I was watching an updated old wu tang martial arts video. 
$C: Looks a bit like star wars
$C: That part where he sets the fruits free won me over. 
$C: Oh god the kitsch, I love it!
$C: Did anyone notice at 0:15 they made the wood on the arrow flex just like a real one !
$C: Even better!
$C: Bollywood is basically me thinking about what i should have done in a fight, after the fight.
$C: In fairness they did this in "Hero" many many years ago. 
$C: I like how they all fired at the same time but the arrows arrived at different times. 
$C: I wanted to walk into a wall or a tree at the end...
$C: that's an awfuly unpractical way to store your sword (also wouldn't it rust in the water ?I'm starting to think this movie isn't realistic at all)
$C: How is that crazy? Make his sword and the arrows glow and put the archers in white plastic and you basically have Star Wars. 
$C: Should've had Indiana Jones just shoot him at the end.
$C: That's like real life anime
$C: I can't be the only one who thought this was Douglas Reynholm's daydream. I mean, come on! The smug look on his face and even the posture match!

https://youtu.be/p6FcYpa3Ey4
$C: Matrix-like
$C: To hell with talking about this**One** obvious masterpiece, is there a sub where I can see every damn one.
$C: I’m just curious, and would love to hear from an Indian moviegoer how these films are being perceived. What is the target audience? The plots seem to be for immature grown-ups, but the effects and protagonists always appear so over-the-top silly, that it feels like they’re aiming for some form of slapstick. 
$C: First sword of bravo who
$C: I should watch more Indian movies that was like watching a parody knowing it isnt one which makes it more funny.
$C: This feels like the Sharknado of Bollywood.  

I hope it's on Amazon.  
$C: Hey, they stole that “watery tart lobbing a scimitar” thing....
$C: [deleted]
$C: I did that once in real life. 
$C: I bet I could do this at home. I'll get a few friends together and give it a shot.
$C: It looks like someone made a movie of their D&D campaign.
$C: Seems realistic.
$C: So that’s what a Hollywood movie would look like with a tenth of its budget...
$C: That was dope as fuck! I need to start watching Bollywood movies.
$C: Genji irl
$C: Is that Regis from Slumdog? 
$C: Someone please make that a lightsaber :)
$C: Is Bollywood the new Kung Fu Hustle?
$C: I think [Hero](https://youtu.be/A0XOjEah6E8) did it better.
$C: Read the title as 'Piranhas sword training' instead of 'Prabhas' ... was disappointed 
$C: hentai
$C: It was nice of them to stutter their fire for him.
$C: please tell me this smug asshole dies at the end
$C: Panties got moist and he knows it. 
$C: Freakin sick.
$C: this is basically an Indian Ip Man
$C: It's funny because I find this ridiculous, but I don't find Jedis hitting blaster shots that go way faster crazy.
$C: Jinder Mahal can do no wrong. 
$C: Take a drink every time something unrealistic happens
$C: This is funny. No wait it's serious. Disregard that, it's definitely comedy. 

Ahh! I don't know what to think about Bollywood films. Are they making it with full serious-ness? Do they know how goofy it looks? What's the deal?
$C: things I love:

1) that sword was never going to land in his hand like that from the first few flips

2) Why did the arrows get so tiny?

3) PLUMS!
$C: Well, I know what I’m doing tomorrow. 
$C: All three versions of each movie are different languages. Is there an English version?
$C: Even on UK Netflix. What a day
$C: Where?? Under what name? I tried finding them.

Do *not* tell me I'm not allowed to watch this glory in Finland. :c
$C: As an English-speaker, which language version should I watch?
$C: Not on Hong Kong Netflix. They have a bunch of other B/Tollywood movies, but I wouldn't know where to begin with those.
$C: > They're both on Netflix. 

Oh hell yes. Baahubali weekend, y'all
$C: * Netflix Releases Punisher*

*I don't resubscribe*

*I see a 15 second clip from a Bollywood movie, others mention the rest is on Netflix*

*I SUBSCRIBE TO THE HIGHEST PREMIUM*
$C: What’s the original language? I noticed three different versions done in different languages on Netflix. 
$C: The second one (finale) is out - if you weren't disappointed by the first, the second will be a treat! No loose ends, plot checks out. The action scene here is what I felt was the farthest they took. 
$C: If you're into Indian movies I'd really recommend watching Bajirao Mastaani. It's legit very good 
$C: "several horses were harmed in the making of this film."
$C: Wow, those horses were brutalized during filming.
$C: HORSE DRIFTING
$C: TIL everything in India is made of glass, cars can jump and guys have balls so hard that they can stop two horses with them.
$C: TIL you can use a horse as a drift car. 
$C: I wasn't aware that throwing a stick at a car's fender made it fly 50 feet into the air.

Neat!
$C: [This part](https://youtu.be/JRn1Kl_kke8?t=1m31s) makes me uncomfortable.  
$C: Your move america.
$C: 1:36 Holy shit this man has balls of steel
$C: Sampled in a great [song by King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ4DE2327bk) with the same title.


$C: Indian(a) Jones
$C: Hah, that music sting is straight out of Terminator 2.
$C: I like how the car crashes wind like someone knocked over a China hutch. Out makes me giggle
$C: That was amazing. 
$C: Holy shit that made me upset
$C: Lol
$C: Megastarrrrrr
$C: God I love it. 
$C: Marking for later
$C: > when I search by critic rating baahubali 2 is second on my server.

Dammit man don't leave us hanging!  What's number 1?
$C: What other movies do you recommend, especially in Telugu? 
$C: Can I borrow your home server please 
$C: What is 1st on your server?
$C: The mpaa will be contacting you shortly.
$C: This gives me hope, but I've seen this before... someone says "amazing" about a movie like this and I get a half-serious half-comedy dance off and at the end the hero's and villans do a sign off dance together.

Just a bit off-putting.
$C: It's very much good movie!
$C: So. Are you telling me that tere are not one, but two of this? This wilkl be the most epic weekend of my year!
$C: What's number 1?
$C: there is two parts to this, awesome!
$C: 👌 
$C: Because it is on YouTube. For free. 

$C: If you want English that's subbed
$C: Exactly.  The title is "Bollywood at its finest" but Telugu isn't Bollywood, it's Tollywood iirc

Source: am Indian
$C: Haha, well he'll sure have a lot of explaining to do when he gets back to the states
$C: Trust me this is much better than the ones we usually watch
$C: How did Telugu Hollywood originate in Tamil Chennai?
$C: You're the best. 
$C: K
$C: I'm not a bright man. I know how to find things when replied to. I dunno where things I save are found. 
$C: Gonna watch this on Netflix right after Stars Wars tomorrow.  
$C: Ah, I assumed it was a style. Like saying Wuxia
$C: But not Netflix Au
$C: Yes.
$C: Yes
$C: Language
$C: same movie just different languages.
$C: Just language as far as i know. 
$C: It's not in English but there are English subtitles available
$C: I know there's a part one and part 2, but there are multiple versions of each part. I guess they are just language differences.
$C: >Edit- There is also a Tollywood based on the Bengali language

Shouldn't that be Galiwood?
$C: Kollywood is Tamil Nadu film industry & Mollywood is Malayalam (Kerala) cinema industry. 
$C: You have facted me in the best possible way.
$C: India and other places should have tried to name the studio areas after local trees like the British Pinewood studios and the original Hollywood is. That would have been more interesting names then the start of a city/region and wood in the end.
$C: wow TIL, have an updoot :)
$C: I live in Tollygunge, I have heard about the movie thing there but nah, nothing I have ever seen.
$C: What are the stylistic or cultural differences like?
$C: Found sharmaJi ka beta

$C: I watched a movie last night revolving around Punjab and Sikh culture.  What -wood would that be?
$C: Not to be confused with [Kollywood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_cinema).
$C:  This movie might've been produced in Hyperabad but it looks Hyperagood. 
$C: Its like an entirely different world over there. One of rape, corruption, and poverty. Im glad ill never have anything to do with it lol 
$C: Jesus fucking Christ stop being this butthurt about everything.
$C: How many of those languages does the average Indian speak?
$C: Why do you have so many languages? America does too but they're from all around the world. Why do Indians need multiple languages? 
$C: There's also Kollywood and Mollywood. 
$C: I know that this might get buried under the comments.Telugu is basically a completely different language compared to the Bollywood Hindi. It is part of the unique dravidian family and is a huge component of the Indian diaspora.
There is also a way different dynamic in them too. Bollywood movies tend to water down topics and concepts for their audience and tend to mashup everything they can into some performance. They will mix Indian styles with western concepts like love and finding yourself through trips and stuff like that. 

But the south is way more different, they take masala flicks to a whole new level out here, and it most evident in Telugu movies. A lot of movies are based on a powerful lead role and his antagonist villain, and war in between. Generally, the villain likes the heroine or is related to her. A lot of this is kind of borrowed from the Ramayana. The hero doesn't do much other than hang with his posse, who often has comedians along with him. But his interaction with the villain often forces him to take a path that is very dangerous. 

As a Telugu, here are some recommendations outside of Bahubali. I don't want to spoil it for everyone. So,I'll try to leave a sentence.

**Varsham**- A classic. Guys meets girl. Girls dad is an alcoholic and borrows money from a gangster for booze. Gangster wants the hand and the rest is all set in the rain.
**Pokiri**- cop movie. Undercover cop goes into underworld to find a gangster and meets a girl in the process. 
**Khaidi**-1980s version. Another classic. About a rebel. 
**Justice Chowdary**- 1970s Indian version of Clint Eastwood, and badass judges. 
**Alluri Sita Ram Raju**- A story of a Telugu freedom fighter.
**Shiva**-One of Ram Gopal Varmas first crime masterpieces.
**Magadheera**- a more realistic version of bahubali. Also made by the same guy. 
**Sudigadu**- a non stop comedy. Jokes are everywhere and very direct.
**Gabbar Singh**-For you Bollywood lot, it's dabanng without Salmans abs and more comedy 


If anyone has any more suggestions, just PM me. They are on Netflix and Amazon prime. A lot of Telugu movies are found on [einthusan, a pirated service with ratings too](http://einthusan.tv/) and are super meme worthy.
$C: How bout morning wood?
$C: The industries are very different.  Mollywood for example, will not have such unrealistic movies.
$C: So basically Japanese movies are just Korean movies with a different language? They both are Asian afterall. 
$C: So Bollywood stands for movies with belugu language?
$C: Imagine a Bollywood *Fist of The North Star* film.

"तुम मर चुके हो."

"क्या?!?"

*head explodes in hindi*
$C: You can't do much worse than Hollywood in that regard.
$C: yeah, even blockbusters with a more "realistic" setting (e.g. not talking about superhero movies - which can get a pass because they are supposed to be a "fantasy" - but films like "Mission Impossible" or "Jurassic World") seem to have countless scenes in them that are in complete disregard to real life physics.

(which imo can sometimes even get annoying, depending on how "realistic" the rest of the movie wants us to take its premise)


$C: I see, I certainly found those youtube videos of Rajnikanth movies ridiculously funny (but that's Tamil), what is the crazy/ridiculous part about Bollywood? 
$C: Probably because your partner doesn’t know the language. There isn’t enough appeal in the general films if one can’t get the humor linked with the language. 
$C: Ahhh, that makes sense. Thanks!
$C: "princess causes too much of drama " .exactly,  like what the hell,  she straight up insults her Mother-in- law in front of everyone.  I support women who voices their opinion (the kingdom is ruled by a woman) . But she shows too much pride. If she kept her calm in at least one of the scenes,  her husband wouldn't be dead. 
$C: Wow Alia Bhatt is pretty ? Have you seen her without makeup? God you have some low standards. My house maid is prettier than her. Tel me one movie of her that has a strong storyline and does not portray her like a sex doll ? She is a pathetic actress and is only there because of her Bhatt family name.mHow old are you exactly ? 15? Better watch some porn if you are that desperate.jeez..
$C: Get out. 
$C: r/onionlovers
$C: r/ofcoursethatsathing/
$C: Well I'm not an IIT grad, but close enough. Boo engineers! Basic sciences to the win!
$C: I think both the movies - part 1 & 2 are on netflix
$C: no dub, no Indian's about to pay for an English dub lol. There are subtitles however on Netflix and YouTube as well!
$C: Ja there’s no dub for English. The the only dub is for Hindi (Original language is Telugu).
$C: Not necessarily true... the Telugu film industry isn't like... broke. And, one of the largest film industries in India. 
$C: ...idk if you these people are mocking or being genuine, I mean it's not that great when compared to your Hollywood movies, right?
$C: You might want to sit down for this, son...
$C: [deleted]
$C: And my axe!
$C: L: Final count 42
$C: its called [DM of the Rings](https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=612) and is written by Shamus Young
$C: Not just the prequels, they've also gone through the original trilogy (Han has great faces), and are currently "playing" through Rogue One as a flashback of a side game (explained as some if the players missing, so they didn't want to play the main one) that ended in a TPK ;).
$C: Did you show them this movie?
$C: Whoosh 
$C: > Wait! People actually ~~did~~ **do** this?

There are probably people doing this right now. Common as dirt in battles and used to this day pretty much all the time, although shield technology has advanced...obviously.
$C: Well hard to tell if hes joking or not by just text...
$C: Ah ok.

I mean, im still an idiot tho.
$C: So hyped for the sequel!
$C: Underrated comment
$C: The Incredibles, my dude. 
$C: oshit I saw the the tamil and malyalam versions.

EDIT: So after I carefully rewatched a little of bahubali 2, I realized that its in fact Bhali Bhali, not Bahu Bahu. I've been mishearing it the entire time.

In my defense, Bahu Bahu Bahubali fits much better together.
$C: You can enjoy it only if you assume that the story is happening in some another planet and the physics and power of the characters are totally different from what is possible on earth. Also, main characters are like Hercules with 100x more power than the average joe of this world.
$C: Which languae version is better.. 

Last thing I want to watch is dubbed movie with subtitles. 

I once watched a Finnish movie, dubbed in to German with English Subtitles.  Thought my copy was out of lip sync. 
$C: thank you! i know what to watch this weekend
$C: Whao there's a random hindi song and spiderman is dancing to it
$C: OMG I laughed my ass off xD thanks for the link 
$C: Could be? This is 100% an extremely obvious troll.
$C: Apparently the people at t_d decided to brigade every subreddit they can find to spread their hate. This could be a troll but it could be the former also. 
$C: Lawdy U dumb.  You have the chance to stargaze beauty but you're too busy looking down worried about stepping in dogshit.  So you're whole experience in life become about avoiding dogshit.  I recommend a brave new direction for you!  Look up at the wonder of it all and deal with the dogshit if/when it happens.  It's worth it I promise. 
$C: Some shit about Indians are weak because they have tapeworms or stuff. Obvious troll was obvious
$C: Going through /top
$C: Reddit lo oka telugu video all time top 10 lo untadhi anuole
$C: Man, Poe's Law really applies to your comment... I honestly don't know how to interpret your comment
$C: Except in when they're the good guys in Prince of Persia.
$C: Ironically Greeks didn't think of themselves as related to Northern Europeans, who were Barbarians in their eyes. They considered themselves Mediterranean. Same with the Romans. Western Civilization isn't necessarily white. 
$C: I was making a joke... but since you asked, "Greeks being depicted by Western Europeans" is definitely a thing.

Anyway, "white" is a *social* construct that only exists to exclude specific *social* groups. It is *not* the same thing as ethnicity, has been debunked time and time again, yet seems almost impossible to root out.

Kat Blaque has an excellent series on this:

- [The history of whiteness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHct5IHxrA)
- [The Asian who wanted to be white](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeLjkoLzyBE)
- [Caucasian in America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsKx59n4TnQ)

And you can also read up on Wikipedia if you want:

- [Scientific Racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism)
- [Historical Race Concepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_race_concepts)

Yes, skin colors exist, genetic differences and the resulting ethnicities do exist. But look at how racial lines are divided and the historical origin is *always* socio-culturally motivated, which has nothing to do with biology. The best proof of that is looking at what different countries consider a race. For example, "latino" is only a "race" in the US, with the historical origin of creating a way to "other" the Latin Americans:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latino

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic%E2%80%93Latino_naming_dispute

Another example: as Kat mentions in her video, at one point [the Irish were not considered white](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Scientific_racism_irish.jpg).

So again: biologically, races don't exist. Socially, they have never been anything else but *labels*, conveniently used by the ruling socio-economic class to keep up segregation.
$C: They really aren't. 
$C: These are South Indians. The 'white' Indians are mostly up north.
$C: Seriously, come on and at least *try* to keep up.
$C: Kränkt! 
$C: Too late to invade now.  
We have 1.5 billion people to throw at you till we win. :P
$C: England beat us to it
$C: Oooh ok after reading other comments and yours I get it. So calling every over the top indian movie "Bollywood" is like saying any 3D american film is "Dreamworks". I thought it was a genre too, but that makes total sense.
$C: >Indian audiences seem.... just more in it to be entertained, 

Yep, I remember initially on reddit, Interacting with westerners I was always confused why the heck do they always demand realism in a movie to be good, but now I just chalk it up to different expectations.
$C: How is it oversimplification about watching movies. It is an explanation for the continued presence of the dance numbers shot abroad, over the top action scenes. Most indians go to movie for thorough entertainment, not to weep and whine over ww2 movie like Schindler's list. There are people who like those movies too but few percent. 
$C: But not completely incorrect. 
$C: By bollywood do you mean indian movies or just bollywood? Any way some recommendations available easily online (prime/Netflix/itunes) are: 
Baahubali series,
Enthiran/Robot,
Dangal,
Arjun Reddy,
PK,
Lipstick under my burkha,
Samsaaram aarogyathinu haanikaram(very interesting story line),
Charlie,
Leader,







$C: It's bhangra
$C: Neither do I becuase I watched it without sound, it still looks really cool, even if only to see another culture were men wear skirts (aside from Scottish people)
$C: Thats Bollywood for you!
$C: Watch Baahubali 1 & 2(the gif in the post is from that movie) if you haven't. It has everything you wanted. Here is the trailer for the first movie - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NQRhE772b0 
$C: Lol didn’t you watch the trailer before?
Even the name of the movie is the two lovers
$C:  \- Adult movies : Hardwood
$C: Add to the list: Gujarati: Dhollywood 
$C: I would say mollywood makes the most realistic movies of them all
$C: So Kannada is where we all get our sandalwood incense from?
$C: Wow seems like Indian men likes lot of wood 😂
$C: Ouarzazate (Morocco) - Ozzywood
$C: I understand Urdu and Hindi because I grew up watching Bollywood movies, I thought that was it. Didn’t know others existed besides Bollywood. Interesting. 


$C: Less than half, around 49 % I think. 
$C: ...and others learn it just because of the popularity of Bolly movies...
$C: Malaysian here. 

Ranjikanth is king! There was actually a riot in the cinema when the seats at one of his movie premieres was sold out.
$C: Is he really popular in Japan ?
$C: Depends on who you ask 😂
$C: Next door in Pakistan, they have [Lollywood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lollywood). 

Just so people understand though, none of these are official names. These are names that have sort of caught on during the years. Most of these film industries are named after their languages (i.e., Bollywood is officially known as Hindi Film Industry).
$C: Indian tamil film industry is usually referred as kollywood. 
$C: Noone will ever say tollywood for tamil cinema. 
$C: Also Bengali films, and with more justification, since the movie industry was based out of Tollygunge, a neighbourhood in south Calcutta.
$C: Tamil film industry is known as Kollywood coz most of the production houses were based out of Kodambakkam.
$C: is it pollywood or ballewood?
$C: This guy tollies 
$C: ＼(\^o\^)／
$C: Mollywood is the state Kerala's film industry, which makes films in malayalam the state language. 

$C: But that's another film industry 
$C: Except molly is slang for mdma, and wood isn't something you usually get with it, apparently.
$C: He's right though.

The information is right here on the internet and takes you ~5 seconds to find.
$C: Downvoting him doesn't make him wrong.

It boggles my mind why anyone would ask a question here and wait minutes-hours for a possibly incorrect answer when you can google it and get a verified answer in seconds.
$C: It's both better and worse.

https://youtu.be/1JABdS-HN5A

Full disclosure, made in Uganda not Nigeria, but you still deserve to watch it lol
$C: My parents watch a lot of Nollywood movies and it does have a lot of rich families, scams, black magic and loud screaming. It's very exaggerated, much like earlier bollywood movies.
$C: You can definitely judge a movie based on varied characterstics
$C: No, it doesn't have good CGI. 
$C: meh, who wants to watch the award movies.
$C: Where did you see 2.0?
$C: I watched 3 idiots.

My fucking sides.
$C: >Drishyam (Hindi version)

Um, not sure why you are recommending the mediocre Hindi version when the original Malayalam version is much better.
$C: > Bajirao Mastani (2015)

Ah, that's the one with the motherfucking cool dance scene, correct? I still need to watch that.
$C: 'A Wednesday!' is a fantastic thriller as well! 
$C: 3 idiots? 
$C: should add Haider too
$C: Welp this will keep me busy for some time, thank you!
$C: ~~An all Hindi/North Indian movie list? ... Bahubaali as a Telugu/South Indian is a great "Mass" blockbuster and there are many great story heavy movies but they are considered a different genre. You really should account for your own tastes and not throw around judgements like this.
~~

Edit: my bad. I mistook the original poster for you, I think you should put a disclaimer that your list isn't comprehensive of all Indian cinema, especially South Indian cinema. 
$C: I've just gone through half of Baahubali and I am loving it so far. Are any of those movies similar in feel and setting as Baahubali? Can you recommend any more movies like Baahubali? :)
$C: Why don't you add Wednesday to the list ?
$C: Bajirao Mastani has a horrible plot that has nothing to do with history.
$C: Am sure OP here only watches Sergio Leone or Kurasawa movies. 
$C: What?
$C: But the movie isn't 
$C: He provided the cushioning :P
Anyway, I think even the other soldiers are stronger than normal humans but not as OP as the protagonist. What is really OP is the tree which managed to provide such a strong elastic force!
$C: the entire movie is based on hindu mythology, and if you've heard of any mythology story before, you know that even the retards have super strength.

Also this was not a joke as one of the characters is physically lame but is still able to put his fist through a marble pillar.
$C: You sound mad. 
$C: Well Avengers had a budget of around 200 million. 2 Bahubali movies have a total budget of 50 million or so.
$C: O yeah, that is definitely true. Difference in their budget must be clearly the reason. Also Hollywood got a whole lot more experience in films made with cgi than Indian cinema. But Avenger uses cgi to create the usual superhero scenes, this movie uses cgi to do crazy things.
$C: No. The gif is a different movie (I’m not too familiar with South Indian films apart from a few that I’ve watched). The intense over-acting in South Indian films (Tollywood, for example) is hilarious though. 
$C: Woo-hoooo
$C: Link both your Aadhaar card AND PAN card with your phone number?
$C: Fuck that... it's exciting and fun. It's an action movie for christ's sake it doesn't have to be accurate. Use your imagination, It's a universe where physics take a back seat to bad ass motherfuckers!
$C: Basically means they don't add in gravity or weight?
$C: Lel I am a Bangali so parallel cinema is in my blood. None of those were parallel maybe except Being Cyrus.
$C: Like 6 hours including the first movie. 
$C: sounds like the director really cared about his movie and just wanted to see it come to fruition :3

what a happy ending
$C: the things you learn every day!!
$C: I don’t think he hates Indians, just the feces squalor and unhygienic conditions they make. 
$C: 3 Idiots is an example.
$C: Did you just compare food to entertainment? 
$C: That looks awesome lol, they even have the full had video with subtitles on YouTube!
$C: ...Bollywood should've made the Prince of Persia movie. D:
$C: This movie looks damn incredible!
$C: I'm not gay but......... 
$C: The hair product budget alone would be second only to the CGI.
$C: This looks like a multimillion-dollar Hollywood Blockbuster, I'm watching this this weekend, this is epic.
$C: Not going to lie, this movie looks fucking awesome.
$C: Fuck going to Star Wars, I’m watching this! (Edit: well, I actually went to Star Wars, but I'm watching this tomorrow!)
$C: Great find! Make sure you watch the part 1, that way it will double the excitement to watch part2. The director & cast took ~5yrs to make both parts and cast was not allowed to do other films through that 5yrs! 
$C: This movie looks really fucking good. 
$C: You'll have to see Baahubali 1 first!
$C: My God, that man's hair is magnificent. It even has its own localized wind!
$C: Whoever edited that trailer doesn’t get paid enough. That looks like the best thing since 300.
$C: Highly recommend Baahubili. (Sorry if I spelled it wrong!) Watch both of them!
$C: Both movies are on Netflix and are amazing 
$C: Any chance it's available  with subtitles? 
$C: This movie is one of my all time favorites. You will not be disappointed! It's on netflix.
$C: Thank you for finding this!  Totally watching 1 and 2 this weekend.
$C: That's part two! make sure to watch Part one. These movies are quintessential bollywood
$C: Wow, thanks!

I was all "New Star Wars" this weekend, but now, *this*.

$C: Thanks for the link
$C: Replying so I can dig it during weekend
$C: I need to find the first one, looks soooo good. 
Also, Mel Gibson?
$C: Woooooooooooooooooow
$C: That trailer looks Kung Fu Hustle-level brilliant/absurd
$C: Hopefully blockbuster has a copy!
$C: Yesss!!! Thank you!!
$C: The trailer you posted up is for Bahubali 2 (The Conclusion). If you start watching the second movie before the first one, I think you could be really confused by what’s going on. I’d recommend watching Bahubali: The Beginning before you watch the second one. Here is the trailer for the first one, it’s on netflix too: 
https://youtu.be/VdafjyFK3ko


$C: It looks like this is on the NetFlix as well: https://www.netflix.com/title/80203996
$C: Wow! Bollywood has really upped their game. 
$C: This movie was actually really awaited by the Bollywood scene as the first one was so good.
$C: Hold up, this is a sequel.  We need to see both Bahubaali’s.
$C: I believe both movies are on Netflix (there are two parts)

Edit: someone already mentioned that
$C: There's a large Indian population in my area, so this actually played in our theater right next to stuff like Spider-Man.
$C: That muscle punch 💪🤛 Damn, bro 
$C: You have to watch the first [Trailer](https://youtu.be/VdafjyFK3ko) movie before the 2nd. 

Make sure you watch in high quality. Theses are fantastic movies.
$C: Meet too, thanks for finding that. Already bought 1&2 on Google play lol. 
$C: I hate this movie, but it's genuinely fun to watch with friends and point out all the ridiculous shit.
$C: This reminded of Kung Fu Hustle, in a really good way.
$C: Nice
$C: This guy though: 

https://youtu.be/G62HrubdD6o?t=106
$C: Ditto
$C: What language is the film in?
$C: why was a tanned Mel Gibson at the end of the trailer?
$C: Doooood!
$C: Dude, thank you. This movie looks amazing lol, and it's the second, so I have 2 movies to watch!
$C: And its number 2?!
$C: Thank you. I'm totally watching this.
$C: Ok, that is awesome. I wanna watch 1 and 2 this weekend.
$C: Holy Shit, I think that is Rafi from 'The League'.
$C: You gotta watch the first one first. Also watch out for people getting beheaded.
$C: 8.5 on IMDB. Not too shabby
$C: Well I was going to study this weekend ...
$C: Ok that looks incredible. 
$C: Masturbating?
$C: Masterbating?
$C: I've been watching the wrong movies.
$C: That looks awesome, but it looks like some director in India is way too big a Zack Snyder fan.
$C: Please don't join a human catapult. It's not worth the risk.
$C: These are the shit filled streets our ancestors told us about.
$C: Well now I know why it takes tech support so long to get me off hold. 
$C: Re: The Matrix:


A scene shortly before we see Cypher meeting the Agents -- it might even be the scene directly before -- has Neo chatting with Cypher at the operator panel. It's the conversation with "I don't even see the code anymore, it's just blonde, brunette, redhead..."

Remember when he notices Neo, he's shocked, and jumps? "Neo, you scared the bejeesus out of me." And then he quickly changes the screen display?

He was programming the console for a solo trip, so it'd automatically retrieve him when certain conditions were met. He jumped because he was "caught." He changed the display because he didn't want Neo to figure out what he was doing. If someone other than Neo had seen those screens, he probably would have been busted.

$C: For The Karate Kid, doesn't the girl say something like "Everything above the waist is a point" and then go on to specifically mention the head?


And in Toy Story I thought Buzz froze when people were around so they wouldn't know that he's a real space ranger.

Edit: or as people are saying below Buzz could be freezing because he is a toy and it's just a thing all toys do without thinking. It probably takes a bit of awareness (aware you're a toy and aware of the rules) to be able to break them and move in front of a human.

$C: Star Wars one kinda makes sense. Given how huge the universe is and Vaders hatred for the planet, he'd never go back there (and never does).

You'll be reading the part of "Man #4 Who Gets Trampled By 6 Elephants."

$C: Hahahaha 
$C: Megalolz
$C: Fun fact. Do to an attempt to be more inclusive in 2016 they changed it to Catapult Gurus of India.
$C: I wish i had gold to give you for this

You mean the year they had the longest winning streak since the 1916 Giants?
$C: it's a Game of thrones quote. no idea wtf you're talking about
$C: Probably my people's assholes. Do you know how much curry goes through my peoples colon daily? Enough to wipe out a herd of King Kongs.

$C: Wait Men in Tights is one Netflix now!?!? 
$C: Best Robin Hood movie.
$C: Why use a spoon?
$C: Reddit's experience with Hindi/Telegu/Bollywood movies is limited to a series of gifs and clips they can giggle at. Your average redditor used these terms without knowing the scope.

Most have never and will never see the truly amazing choreography/set design and captivating stories in well-executed Indian films.
$C: Which really stinks before I LOVED baahubali 2! 
$C: I’m still waiting for someone to actually give a good explanation of the difference rather than just getting their panties in a bunch and telling us what it’s not. You can’t blame people for thinking that an Indian film belongs to the largest Hindi movie industry. That’s like getting upset because someone in China doesn’t know a Sundance film is not a Hollywood movie.
$C: Bollywood can't be taken seriously, even it is a billion dollar market in India. Cheesy acting, absurd stories and a copycat of Western settings! In general it is suggested that Indian only plant trees, so they can dance around them. The remakes are more ridiculous than American remakes of South-Korean or Japanese films. For Westerners it is just colourful, trashy and funny. Only quality Indian films are being produced outside the Bollywood machine. Satyajit Ray was on of the great film makers. 
$C: Not Punjab, the work excelt by itself. When my movie makers self taught themselves even Spielberg know what's up
$C: You're thinking of Kung Pow
$C: Was that a Spider-Man 3 reference?

$C: I, actually am from Hyderabad  
I just thought he wouldn't understand what Tollywood meant
$C: What??
$C: Yeah, I messed up, corrected now
$C: Misclicked?
$C: Not a much patriotic indian guy, I think that Hollywood is great , but , yes , there is a lack of that 'freeness' or ' hype'   type feel that sometimes makes things a bit bland.
$C: Uh, I wouldn't say best... We just credit Salman for being good, because objectively... He can't act and is only there because of his fans. 
$C: It's more like seeing fantasies on the screen.
$C: Those are egg-shaped disappointment. They come apart in halves, and one half has chocolate creme in it while the other has a small plastic toy.
$C: God damn now i wanna learn hindi
$C: So you *are* gay. Congrats
$C: Hey, $20 buys a lot of mouthwash.

$C: Pretty sure that wink made me pregnant.
$C: What does it make me if I'm gay?
$C: I think this is the Bollywood equivalent to Shoot'Em Up.
$C: OHGODNO RICKYYY
$C: You sucking?
$C: I know right? Sploosh, or whatever the male version is. Which I guess is still sploosh... but with semen.
$C: I believe you're out of luck, however.
$C: It's fine as long as you weren't gay before. Otherwise that would be quite gay 
$C: What about [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKL75628ubA)?
$C: Yeah I was on the edge but then he winked...... Hot diggidy something changed in me. 
$C: I'm gay and that made me like woman penis

$C: No phobo 
$C: How gay?
$C: That is a beautiful man. 
$C: Why did that make you not turned on by women?
$C: Why dis make ur gay? All make Indian wet. Sometime it natural to do the unnatural!
$C: I suck a dick once a month just to make sure I still don't like it.

"I shall fix the water fountain"

"but no plumber has ever managed to fix the holy water fountain"

"I can"

*does a bamboozle*

"He did a bamboozle, but no one can say there is no more water in the water fountain."

"I shall now dance the dance of my plumber people"

$C: you can buy a smaller version from amazon and lift it yourself and feel awesome. 
https://www.amazon.com/Lingam-Statue-Carving-Portable-ShalinIndia/dp/B00W52DYM2
$C: It's simple. He moved Shiva lingam to water. So his mother no needs to bring water to lingam because water is heavy and she is old. So in one deed he pleased Shiva and helped his mother.

ॐ नमः शिवाय

$C: > I've no idea WTF just happened.

simple , this fuker just lifted 10 ton idol made up of granite like it was a wooden plank . everyone are  shocked that someone that strong exist , also 

to further answer (in case you are wondering)


>why 

because his mom made a promise to herself ( and god) to climbs the hill 100 time and  bathe the god (praying) , because there is a folklore that says those who do this get their wish granted .

>what's her wish

 to get her son to stop his suicidal ambition to climb a fucking mountain, which he nearly died from , more than a few time. he has been trying since he was a kid , this time he was seriously injured

>what did he do

since he couln't convince his mom to stop straining herself he did the next best thing , he carried the god/idol to a waterfall, now his mother doesn't need to carry  100 bucket of water to pray/clan the idol 

>did it work ?
 
no, but his mom realized he isn't a kid anymore , he is blessed by god with ridiculous level of strength and decided to let him choose his fate

>why did he dance at the end


....india
$C: So the guy just lifted a multi-ton pure granite statue of what may or may not be god's penis.
$C: 'OLD SPICE, FOR MENNNNNNNN' 
$C: I liked the part where he carried the heavy thing.
$C: Is this like an Indian version of Fist of the North Star? 
$C: Best part is that he doesn't deadlift it, he bicep curls that shit. 
$C: If I had to guess, he's the main character of a video game, and he had a sidequest to redecorate the town by putting the statue under the waterfall, then he did and got a star/moon/jiggy or whatever, and then did his dance he does every time he gets one that gets really annoying after awhile.
$C: When he jumps in the water, you can see the foam bends on his shoulder. I am actually fun at parties. 
$C: he is a special bad ass and he moves the shrine so that his adopted mother doesn't have to labor so hard during her prayers involving moving water to it.
$C: Wtf was he carrying and why?
$C: In context, this was actually a really sweet scene.
$C: It seems to me that most bollywood movies are an Indian dude with enough money to make a movie of them doing ridiculous badass things
$C: Safe lifting 101

r/osha
$C: Yeah this looks beyond the typical Bollywood "so bad it's actually hilarious" and looks more like a well produced action-comedy. Actually interested in watching the whole thing.
$C: It was one of the most expensive movies (or the most expensive?) of all time. Baahubali 2 is actually really amazing and beautiful, despite the ridiculous scenes. The world is very grand and the story is actually really well told as well. It's worth checking out!
$C: Most stuff reddit has seen is from old 80s and 90s Indian flicks. GDP growth in India isn't happening in a vacuum, the production values of Indian movies is rising pretty damn rapidly.
$C: If theres brad pitt itd make alot of sense 
$C: Yeah, nothing crazier than I've seen in kung fu movies. 
$C: My people have make some best cig! The Chi used in this movie have been recognize by top movie makers. Spielberg have called the director to congratulate!
$C: >implying it didn't


also that head tattoo thingy looks cool
$C: the whole movie is on youtube in 4k for free


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5FvgdI6h-c&t=4s

$C: I believe they had researchers to ensure that the stunts were historically accurate.   
$C: Its on Netflix (US) part 1 and 2
$C: One of the best movies of the year- but obviously make sure to watch 1 before 2. The plot and especially the cinematography of the scenes is amazing- everything (especially the locations) looks so good!
$C: [Extended version](https://gfycat.com/FortunatePerfectBuckeyebutterfly)
$C: This is from Bahuballi Part 2. Watch Bahuballi 1and 2. That’s close to 6 hrs of your time. The 2 movies are well entertaining from Indian Telugu language movie industry. It was released in multiple languages. 
$C: Of Reynholm Industries?


Faaaath-errr!
$C: I thought it was almost like an Indian Joe Manganiello
$C: The scene of him deflecting arrows with his sword is basically Jedi vs. Blasters
$C: Man I haven’t thought of that in so long
$C: Too soon. 
$C: Apparently it’s actually Tollywood lol
$C: Right down to the complete randomness of having a floor button to throw a sword out of a lake.
$C: It's the most expensive Indian film to date so that's why I guess.
$C: Holy shit, that's LOTR-level of epic. What the fuck, how is this so unknown?!
$C: Hey, you're right!
$C: Mamathali Talli song
$C: Do you actually believe that anyone made that scene and thought it was 100% serious, haha? You did see him reflect an arrow to drop tasty fruit into the women just for the fuck of it at the end right?
$C: Have you seen Fast and Furious films? I imagine it's the same thing. 
$C: Ok, so first I go to see Star Wars, and then I'm gonna wash my mouth out with this gold. 
$C: There's English subtitles available
$C: You probably only are allowed to with a VPN :-(
$C: If you can understand any of Telugu/Tamil/Malayalam/Hindi you can watch it in that language. If not watch it in Telugu for the lip-sync  
Don't know if you can view it outside of India but official Youtube link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5FvgdI6h-c
$C: Not on Japan Netflix either. 
$C: Telugu. The rest are Dubs
$C: Not even similar 
$C: No. God no.
$C: Gah! I’ve been meaning to see this, I just watch Malhari on a daily basis because I seriously cannot get enough of Ranveer Singh!
$C: This is disgusting. Hundred or more it seems from limited information I’ve found. 
$C: By the look of it some of them died. 

Edit: I count 9 probable deaths. 7 seem like certain death. 
$C: [That looks painful.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRn1Kl_kke8&t=2m35s)
$C: Producer/Director:  "Man... fuck those horses"
$C: I'm pretty sure you can see one break its neck. Probably a few actually.
$C: Throughout both movies, they actually have a disclaimer in the corner of the frame of nearly all scenes with animals, indicating that CGI was used. They went out of their way to make it clear that no animals were harmed.
$C: You know, they sure have a lot of conveniently breakable things for a place made out of bouncy roads and cardboard cars.
$C: Wait,   ...your balls aren't at least 2 horse power? 
$C: Fast and Furriest: Foalkyo Drift
$C: No kidding.  Those horses fell due to trip wire, something outlawed in Hollywood films in the 50s because there's a high chance that the horse will break its face, legs or neck.  It's a shitty thing to do to a horse. 
$C: Damn you actually see the trip wire there.
$C: Baahubali 1.
$C: The Room.
$C: To hell and back.  Audie Murphy playing Audie Murphy doing Audie Murphy things in WW2.
$C: I honestly cannot recommend any others, baahubali and baahubali 2 were the only good ones I've seen.

Of you are looking for foreign films with good action and story that you have never heard of, check out warriors of the rainbow ... It's not your typical cookie cutter action flick.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warriors_of_the_Rainbow:_Seediq_Bale
$C: None. All the bigger  budget telugu films are awful and actually truly deserve a spot here at r/funny
Only the small indie ones are watchable.
That is why Baahubali was one of the rare telugu films I actually deemed to spend my hard earned money on.
$C: Most of them are pretty terrible dude.. Check out "Athadu" I guess
$C: To hell and back.  Also one of my favorite movies of all time.  It's Audie Murphy (most decorated us soldier of all time) playing himself in his autobiography.  They had to tone down the heroism in the main battles to make it more believable even though it's a true story.
$C: >someone says "amazing" about a movie like this and **I get a half-serious half-comedy dance off and at the end the hero's and villans do a sign off dance together.**

But Guardians of the Galaxy WAS amazing!
$C: There is a lot of Indian music and dance, but there are substantial fight scenes too.  The story is very good.  Rest assured the ending is not a dance off although there are large coordinated dance scenes 

The story is really what sets baahubali and baahubali 2 apart from the other movies in the genre.  I'm generally not a fan of Bollywood style movies but I love these 2.
$C: To hell and back.
$C: Checkout more from the same director. Your boyfriend would know. Check out Magadheera. It’s like Baahubali but a bit older (2009). 
$C: Because Hyderabad back then was part of a princely state and unfortunately could not receive the miracles of colonialism like film making. And the remaining Telugu speakers of British India live majorly in Madras state along with Tamil speakers. Separate linguistic identities got strengthened only after independence. That being said, both the film industries go very hand-in-hand generally producing bilinguals etc.
$C: Tag! You're it.
$C: Your profile has a "saved" list. Where it says "overview", you can change that to "saved" and it will show you evening you have selected to save.
$C: We can't handle the bants.
$C: Auch
$C: They *are* on Australian Netflix, though. (I'm a big fan of them)
$C: is one considered the original language?
$C: Someone here said Netflix US has only hindi and Tamil versions, if you don't find the original telugu, then try YouTube. There is a 4k print released in Telugu language in play movies.
$C: Watch it in the original language Telugu 
$C: Because Tollygunje

 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_West_Bengal
$C: 'Gali' in North India means a scolding/bad word. That also could be a reason
$C: It would be Gollywood though.
$C: Please stop calling it Mollywood; it’s disgusting. It’s Malayalam cinema or Malayalam film industry.
$C: We do, Telugus want to call it just TFI (Telugu film industry) , but someone started this woods trend and it stuck.
$C: these are not the only -woods. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_India#Regional_industries) are the others. Most are regional and hence small. There are so many film industries because we have so many languages. The main industries are bollywood (hindi),tollywood (telugu), kollywood (Tamil) and Bhojpuri
$C: Upvote for updoot
$C: Jesus, that is a LONG answer. Hmm, lemme try and put it in some perspective - I work in what you’d call “Bollywood”.  
  
First, a background - India is a _very_ diverse country, perhaps the most diverse nation in existence. Each region has its own unique culture, and almost always its own language. While Hindi and English are spoken almost throughout the country, the local languages are extremely important for sub-culture arts. A lot of effort (sometimes the negative kind) goes into preserving these localised cultures, so that the diversity can be maintained and passed on.  
  
So, North India mainly speaks Hindi to communicate, although Punjabi (F), Kashmiri, and Himachali (F, but nascent) are also widely spoken in their respective states. East India speaks Bengali/Bangla (F), Assamese (F, but small) and a few other localised versions of these languages that I am unfamiliar with. The (F) next to these languages denotes the presence of a unique film industry for that particular language. Punjabi, mainly, being the top regional language to have its own bustling film and music industry.  
  
The South speaks four main languages, each with its own film industry. The languages are Kannada (F), Malayalam (F), Tamil (F), and Telugu (F), which are VASTLY different from the North Indian languages. There are no common words or phonetics to go by, and if a person who speaks only Punjabi converses with someone who only speaks any of the four South Indian languages, communication will revert to Stone Age methods or, worse, Google Translate!  
  
Anyway, West India speaks Gujarati (F) and Rajasthani, but can easily switch to Hindi for communication, the languages being somewhat similar in phonetics.  
  
Each culture reflects the kind of land it survives on. The North is mountains, hills, valleys. The South is hills, valleys, and ocean. The East is plush desert mountains, flush hills, basins, and coast. The West is desert and, oddly enough, coast. I’m not even getting into Central India’s own myriad culture, or the several states I haven’t even mentioned.  
  
Generally, from a bird’s eye view, you won’t find too many differences in our films. Hindi being the most widely spoken language, Bollywood is easily the best funded industry, with even Hollywood studios opening up shop here now. The South is similarly huge but less integrated; remember, the southern languages prove to be a barrier most times. I’m mainly focussing on Bollywood and the Southern industry, the latter regarded as a whole for simplicity. 
  
However, stylistically there’s a few differences when it comes to mainstream cinema. Painting with a broad brush here, Bollywood is somewhat more rooted in reality while Tollywood kinda tends to go all out with its film language (as you can see in the clip above).  
  
While song and dance is common to both industries, the gyrations vary in contrast. Neither industry has the upper hand here, but I find Tollywood eschews aesthetics in favor of raw talent. And so, in Tollywood, you mainly have dancers who can act rather than actors who can dance. Our songs _really_ matter! Again, this is a VERY simplified answer, because there are amazing actors down South.  
  
There’s more, but this is turning into an essay :-/
  

  

$C: Edit- I read your question again and I think all you wanted to know was the name of the Punjabi film Industry. if that is the case, sorry for the long explanation, the -wood it is called Pollywood. (yeah we are unimaginative :P wiki link below)

Name of the movie ? 

The Indian film industry is mainly divided on the basis of language. So even if its based on Punjabi culture, the language it was shot in would reveal the industry. Bollywood, Tollywood, Kollywood, there are many film industries based on the many Indian languages including [Punjabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjabi_cinema). I'm guessing you saw a dubbed movie in English or your own (Japanese ?) language, so the only way to which industry it was made in would be the name.

The culture a particular film industry depicts is not its defining character. Tollywood, i.e movie industry in the telugu language generally depicts South Indian culture because it caters to a south Indian audience. Similarly bollywood generally has north indian influence because that is its primary audience. A particular industry can and has made movies on another culture but the language will always be its own, though it may be dubbed in another. So your Punjabi movie is most likely to be either Bollywood or Pollywood.

$C: Most people here are bilingual at the very least. And even trilingual with English mixed in.
$C: 2-3 usually, most understand Hindi since it’s national plus a few local languages. For instance my dad knows Hindi, Telugu, and Urdu
$C: 2-4 I'd say. I can speak English, Hindi, Marathi, Konkani and Gujarati to an extent. People in the North speak Hindi, English and their native dialect of Hindi. In the south people are bilingual and speak only English along with their mother tongue. People living in cosmopolitan cities can speak three languages at least.
$C: Imagine Europe or say 3-4 countries like Portugal, Spain, France, Germany being one country, that is India.
$C: [deleted]
$C: The same reason why Europe has a bunch of languages. India is not a homogeneous country. 
$C: Dont forget about Dollywood! 
$C: Mollywood sounds trippin'
$C: There's even Hollywood. A pretty obscure and insignificant American rip off.
$C: And there is a lollywood in Lahore, Pakistan!
$C: Some of your recommendations are good but some are pathetic.. Sudigadu, Gabbar Singh... really?


$C: Love Pokiri. It’s basically an Indian version of Sleeping Dogs & Mahesh Babu is a hell of an actor. 
$C: I like to watch films in their original language. Netflix has three versions of Baahubali: Hindi, Tamil and Malayalam. The film also appears to be on Youtube in HD in Telugu. Should I watch the Telugu version I should watch or the Tamil?
$C: Also anybody wanting to watch this, just remember most masala movies tend to be an one-man show and can be misogynistic to a certain degree. The heroines are just eye-candies, existing just for the damsel-in-distress trope. Especially old ones.
$C: Studied in AP in year 2004 , first movie was shrimadri of Jr NTR .. very memorable.. not fond of North India , but south is totally different.. 
$C: This is /r/bestof material 
$C: You'll miss a lot of the jokes in Sudigadu if you don't know of the movies it references.   A lot of the humor from that movie comes from parodying other movies. 
$C: Basically much like the Bollywood of 80s a d 90s
$C: How is Magadheera realistic? The whole 400 years thing is anything but. I would say Bahubali is more realistic because it was only the fighting and strength of Prabhas and Rana that is unrealistic. Also, I never saw what other people see in Gabbar Singh. Couldn't even get through the movie once. 
$C: > Telugu is basically a completely different language

What's with the "basically"? It's about as similar to Hindi as Arabic is to English.
$C: [deleted]
$C: [deleted]
$C: Nice, but no. It's Hindi 
$C: It watch it. Even without subtitles. Just to watch Hollywood's take on Kenshiro, especially his yelling during his attacks. And also the whole head exploding thing and what not. 
$C: The action films are very OTT, like a single punch will send a man flying through the air and a person can do a flying kick from very very very far away. That kind of thing. 
$C: Totally, the family were assholes but she was a bit of a drama queen let's be honest. I blame the hormones. /s for all the females about to attack me. 
$C: Whoa, it actually is
netflix.com/title/80204117
$C: Oh damn
$C: And on YouTube 
$C: They are (Canada). Just added to my instant queue.
$C: And Bahubali was one of the biggest movies made. 
$C: It's absolutely better than most of the crap that comes out of Hollywood.  Baahubali is awesome.
$C: LOL he’s in for a surprise

$C: TRIGGER WARNING: Kerning.

Seriously, it's horrific, if bad kerning gets to you then stay far away from this comic.
$C: This is what drove the Iraq and Vietnam wars to stalemate.  Knowledge of trees by people in their home countries gave (and give) them a tremendous advantage in deploying infantry with shields that invading US forces couldn't hope to surpass even with the use of modern helicopter deployment.
$C: Welcome to the internets
$C: Because after all, I am your biggest fan...
$C: Oh okay thank you and merry Christmas!
$C: Dude it's high fantasy. Watch it as you would watch LOTR.
$C: Hercules is a great comparison, really. It was written to be like a mythological story like that! They took a lot of inspiration from Indian myths and epics.
$C: It's original a Telegu movie dubbed into many languages. I'm sure you'll find subs of your preference because it was released worldwide. Must watch. Production is A+
$C: The emoji makes it 
$C: >sees obvious troll

>'i dunno guys, this might be legit'
$C: The thing is, the post was too over the top, there is no way a person who says that seriously would not be institutionalized.

Everyone who fell for it is too naive in the ways of the internet.

$C: Poe's law?
$C: I mean.....of course. What's the irony here lol.

How are Mediterranean people not white? They literally built Europe.

Furthermore technically the middle East and North Africa is white too.

White is just a modern day construct to begin with so it's all a wash. But if we are talking shares history and people's, and Europe= white then Greece is white.
$C: Well, the greeks and romans considering anyone non greek or roman as barbarians, didn't matter if they where to the north, south, east or west.
$C: Go raibh míl a mhaith agat, mo chara
$C: It is an explanation, but it has no evidence to back it up, and the fact that there are so many different kinds of people who like different kinds of movies makes what you said a generalization. It may be true for some, but it isn't an all-encompassing truth about India (certainly not the bits about malnourishment and stuff).

There are plenty of realistic movies which have been huge hits.
$C: The music will.get you fired up!
$C: The song is amazing
$C: That's Bollywood for you.
Where 11 out of 10 movies are based on pathetic love stories.
$C: Dude I'm a telugu guy, I saw them as soon as I found the tickets.
thanks though
$C: Lol
$C: Sunnywood. She’s making movies over there now. Soft-core but still scandalous there. 
$C: Porn is called 'blue film' in India 
$C: Underwood? 
$C: Kannada is the language spoken in the state Karnataka. That's where the sandalwood comes from :D
$C: If its red sandalwood then it's from Andhra Pradesh (neighbouring state)


$C: Pretty much
$C: Kannada is the language.  
Karnataka is the state where kannadigas(the speakers of kannada) live.  
That's where you get your sandalwood from.
$C: You thought people who didn't speak Hindi/Urdu didn't have movies in their own languages? 
$C: Bengal is also prolific in its cinema (see: Satyajit Ray, who was actually the OG world renowned Indian filmmaker, not Bollywood), and the South’s film production exceeds that of the Hindi film industry. There are also numerous indie and local film circuits beyond the mainstream high budget flicks. It exceeds anything you can find in the U.S.
$C: If you watched enough films to understand Hindi/Urdu, how do you not know there's other regions in India with their own TV channels and movies with their own languages?
$C: What if you include third language Hindi speakers.
$C: Rajnikanth is basically South Indian Chuck Norris
$C: Whoa. 
$C: His movies are literal live action anime
$C: Nope
$C: Pollywood veere! 
$C: Good name for it though... "I finally got with her, but I had Mollywood!"
$C: Lol, it's almost as good as "Shortland street"  a "sitcom" in new Zealand ....well known for terrible acting!😂😂😂
$C: Judging things based on their characteristics? Are you mad???
$C: Movie had terrible CGI but that's not their fault. They had a very shitty budget for the whole movie(don't know about the second movie) but they still managed to make something amazing out of it.
$C: It has good CGI for an Indian action flick with absolutely no basis in realistic physics. 
$C: True, it has terrible CGI
$C: [removed]
$C: Try out Munnabhai duology. Supremely hilarious and overall good too!

Another gem is Newton.. it is v good, and pretty recent.
$C: > when the original Malayalam version is much better.

A friend has seen both and clearly found Hindi one better. Ofc, YMMV...
$C: > that's the one with the motherfucking cool dance scene

you are describing 90% of indian movies.
$C: Yep!
$C: Can't believe I forgot about that one. Thanks for the reminder!
$C: I did! Hit submit way too early lol

Really started to respect Shahid Kapoor as an actor after watching that movie.
$C: I'd start with the most recent movies I listed since they're more, "relatable"?

Luckily, most of these films can be found on Netflix! The first movie I listed [is also on YT in HD color](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq8MktR_Ctc), though I don't think its legally up there. 

Mughal-e-Azam was recently digitized and colorized and it's breathtakingly beautiful. Unfortunately, the copy that Netflix has on there is the black & white version.
$C: I should have specified different film industries. I mentioned these films as Bollywood but forgot that people label all Indian movies as Bollywood 
$C: Watch Bajirao Mastani. Majestic as fuck but is very serious in tone. You would enjoy it.
$C: Magadheera (directed by the same guy who directed baahubali) , Arundathi (fantasy/horror) , Anaganaga oka dheerudu (fantasy/Disney produced) , ayirathil oruvan...
$C: From the same director, a better Baahubali as some believe is this movie called “Magadheera”. Check that out next. Has some really nice music too. 
$C: There's a sequel to Baahubali called [Baahubali 2: The Conclusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G62HrubdD6o). 

What aspect of the movie are you enjoying? The historical aspect of the film? The ridiculous action? The storyline? Here are some that I've watched that are very similar in feel to Baahubali:

[Bajirao Mastani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHOc-4D7MjY)

[Dangal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_7YlGv9u1g)

There's also this Padmavati ([trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_5_BLt76c0)) that's coming out soon that is sort of a fictionalized-historical drama.

$C: I’ve never seen the movie. I pointed out in my post that I only recommended movies that I have seen. Wednesday is definitely on my list of movies I want to watch
$C: But the subreddit is.. 
$C: you losers really have nothing better to do with your lives.
$C: that isn't the fucking argument. OP said they look the same. and they blatantly don't.

and yet dumb fucks downvote lol
$C: I said 

>the digestible masala movies like the ones I mentioned in my earlier post.

They were all reg stuff while being cyrus is a borderline case imo. 

And yea, I have seen all of the ones from that list.
$C: Wow thanks for clearing that up. But I still think his/her comment was rude. I believe in playing nice. 

For example, I think only ignorant dumbfucks believe in and perpetuate stupid stereotypes about people they barely know and countries they have never visited. But you don't see me calling u an ignorant dumbfuck to your face, do you?
$C: If you didn't like 3 Idiots, there maybe something at play here. The movie did smashing business, and many people in the west have showed appreciation as well. Even the chinese made it a grand hit, which was a big big achievement. It was low on fluff, and was pretty good in general.

Nevertheless, I will recommend some movies which you can look up on imdb and if you feel like, pick em up depending upon rating/genre etc  -  lagaan (Oscar finalist), Newton, Drishyam (Hindi version), Kai Po Che, Gangs of Wssaypur (Scorcese loved it), Ugly, Dangal, Being Cyrus (spoken language is English) , Munnabhai duology (Hollywood folks grabbed remake rights for pt1).
$C: Yeah I compared imported stuff available (but not forced) for you to consume, conveniently located so that you will see it in your everyday life. But fair enoifh, it's only foreign (or specifically Bollywood?) on Netflix that bothers you, then?
$C: It's on Netflix too... Both parts..

Check out "Baahubali: The Beginning (Hindi Version)" on Netflix
www.netflix.com/title/80204117?source=android

Check out "Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (Hindi Version)" on Netflix
www.netflix.com/title/80203996?source=android

Both have English subtitles
$C: Just watched both of them. I liked them :O
$C: Whether it's Hindu/telegu I don't care. All I see is Indian movie industry has been come of age, looking and feeling fresh af
$C: Omg. 
$C: My highlights here are the muscle punch at 1:41, Ben Kingsley's Mandarin at 1:35, and the fact that the background theme is literally some guys shouting the name of the movie in a rhythmic fashion.
$C: But is there a dance scene
$C: It also looks like they're both on YouTube for free.
$C: Yes on Netflix
$C: This film was not from Bollywood
and it was from tollywood and it dubbed into Bollywood
$C: [It's his strong hand.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHB00Nu3Ak)
$C: This version you saw was dubbed (in Hindi), original was Telegu. I believe it is available on Netflix as well.
$C: I'd always assumed he had simply created an Avatar of himself to interact with Smith on his behalf which he could control from the console.
$C: Thanks and sorry for doubting your wisdom, friend
$C: AFAIK, they're more than 1.5B. Surpassed China to become most populated lol
$C: That would be ridiculously redundant. We already generate too many Indians. Just check our trains.
$C: The Catapulting Guptas of India. They are a famous circus family and have been doing this for generations.
$C: Catapultees Guild of India
$C: Ohhhhhh okay. The Last Airbender makes a lot more sense now.
$C: Why does that sound really racist? Had the Internet warped me that much?
$C: Oh so that's why there's so many Indians. They're computer generated
$C: Wait wait wait... Indian like (points to center of forehead) or Indian like (Apache war cry)? 
$C: [removed]

$C: Tattooine is a shitty hutt-owned 100% desert planet in a backwater corner of the galaxy. There's no real large-scale trading, no resources on the planet (they farm moisture ffs) and no real government aside from maybe one or two hutt lords who run the equivalent of a drag racing championship.


You want to hide, it's either there or Nar Shadaa.


$C: In Signs, the "aliens" are actually demons.  The water in the priest's house is all holy water.

The "signs" we're all supposed to be seeing, but aren't, are all signs indicating the existence of god's and other spiritual things.  The viewer misreads signs as aliens when it's supposed to push people toward religion.
$C: Ghostbusters 2: They were accused of using Hallucinogens to create the illusions of what the people saw. There were probably believers, but the state turned the populace against them.

Looks like [The Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Indians) are a Cleveland team, so that's what makes the most sense to me.

$C: There is no spoon. 
$C: What would you suggest checking out?  I AM completely ignorant of that stuff, so I'd like a good place to start.
$C: Even in good Bollywood movies the dance scenes are completely immersion breaking. You have movies like Lagaan that are actually pretty solid movies with a bunch of unnecessary dancing that add no value to the actual movie. 
$C: People already explained it in this thread or google it, if you want to know more. 

Nobody is getting upset and I'm not blaming anyone for not knowing the difference. I simply made a remark that it's not Bollywood. 
$C: Not every bollywood movie is a masala film. The mass marketed films that tend to make the most money generally are, but there is range even within bollywood itself (without having to look at other movie industries in India). 
$C: Pronounced as Poon-ja-bi
$C: Ahaha thanks! Absolutely correct. Gotta go watch that now. 
$C: You knew this was coming Pete. You killed my father!
$C: People who don’t know Kung POW are missing a lot. Especially the Taco Bell. 
$C: THAT'S A LOT OF NUTS! 
$C: Weeeeooooooeeeeeeoooooooooooeeeeeeeoooooo....  Quaa!
$C: HOLY SHIT. It's been way too long since I've seen that movie mentioned. Wow, I know what I'm downloading this weekend. Thank you for this, used to love the movie as a kid. 
$C: What was my line again? 
$C: Chosen oooooonnneeee
$C: Hilarious if you like Steve Oedekerks sense of humor. I personally think it's hilarious that he just overdubbed and superimposed himself into a bunch of old martial arts movies haha 
$C: Swinging a chain,
Swinging a chain,
I'm swinging a chain
$C: You're not bdong
$C: The Wild Thornberrys Movie

$C: Disguised as yourself.
$C: I thought it was for a movie? And they're all like "wtf are we doing, we use to be gangstas"
$C: With the whole crew wearing masks of themselves
$C: This is the same reason i dont want to watch quite a few movies. I remember it as being fantastic, and that's all that matters.

$C: boi, how old are you?! The movie was released in 2014... 
$C: ... Wait, that song exists in English?
Original one, AFAIK is in French, from 1975.
$C: awesome thanks !
$C: thanks !
$C: Aagadu is good... If you watch it now in YouTube...
$C: I meant typo. 'u' is next to 'i' on the qwerty keyboard so he misclicked 
$C: Well at least they dont lack an original quality storyline. Indian movies are shitty and needs to get better. 1/7th of humanity and the shit we produce.
$C: I THINK it's in Telugu
$C: I suck dick but I'm not gay, ya feel?

$C: Well yeah, now he is. Just in time for Christmas as well!
$C: op turned gay halfway through typing the comment.
$C: No he’s a deeply closeted homosexual. 
$C: No, he's NOT gay. But he is now.
$C: Less gay than regular gay but gayer than normal.
$C: It's only gay if u make eye contact.
$C: I mean $20 is $20
$C: But I like the taste. 
$C: I’m not gay but $20 is $20.
$C: ...what...?
$C: Okay but he totally went over the line of scrimmage. Refs shoulda called that.
$C: That wasn’t very sudden
$C: Me too. And I'm a dude.
$C: Me too. Sister-Wives!
$C: modest
$C: I don't know, what am I a mathematician?!
$C: Erect.  Welcome to the club.
$C: Straight... You've gone full circle. Twice. 
$C: It is too late, mother. I have seen everything.
$C: [it is this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ibYsQGUAZ7Q)

prepare to open bob and vagene
$C: I read your comment and was confused where the dance was. Then... it appeared..
$C: They were all sad and thirsty with those huge waterfalls and river just a few yards away?  I'm so confused.  That was a slick dance at the end though.
$C: it's lingga, basically a penis statue
$C: Its actually more 

"My mom keeps bringing water to the shrine so i stop climbing a mountain. I will help her get water"


Sage guy: nah son only your mom can get water for her wish

Bahuballi: Fuck that shit 


-brings shrine to waterfall-


B: now there is water forever. Brb going to go climb that mountain
$C: It's not a fountain, it's supposed to be a statue of God Shiva's penis that is on top of Yoni (vagina) that gets worshipped by pouring milk. No joke.

Edit: Penis
$C: "But now we have to walk half a mile to get our water... and there's a river right there."

"That's okay, the cardio will be good for you. Like this!"
$C: You just summed up why I ~~hate~~ love that scene.
$C: Woah. 

More like, he put the penis in the waterfall so now his mom is happy. 

Wow. 
$C: does it come with custom theme music for when I carry it that makes everyone stop what their doing and stare in wonder? 
$C: >portable size for travel. 

Clearly that man has proved that the full sized version is also portable and for travel. 
$C: Ahhh, I see.
$C: The video's audio is Hindi right? But somewhere in this thread someone said this is a telugu film. Is this dubbed? His mouth doesn't tally with the Hindi-sounding voice. Or am I wrong and he is speaking telugu there (my hindi is so basic).
$C: Wait, so right before the victory dance, the dialogue was obviously dubbed. What language was it dubbed to and from? Shouldn't it just be in Hindi?
$C: People like you are the reason Arnold Schwarzenegger ended up as a state governor. 
$C: he's nowhere that aggressive.

he's based on a indian legend like Hercules or wukong , but not well known to even Indians 
 
$C: Its an idol of Shiva. His mother made a promise that she will bath the statue 108 time by bringing water from the river. Guy thought his mother is too old to do it. So he carried the idol to waterfall so that it gets continuously washed by the stream
$C: I saw it part of 1 on Netflix, think more like OTT Indian Hercules/demigod epic. It is not really a comedy but sometimes the action and stuff makes you giggle because it’s so extreme 
$C: Yeah but it's not an action-comedy really. High budget action/drama. 
$C: Nothing comedy about this. And it is actually a Tollywood production, and not Bollywood.. And yes, there is a thing called Tollywood..
$C: It's like the Indian version of Kung Fu Hustle. 
$C: It's actually the most popular film in India right now and like 7th worldwide, I think. I've seen both, and they are glorious.
$C: It's the most expensive Indian film till date.
$C: If you haven't already, you should check out the Krrish trilogy. All three are on Netflix right now. Really great story, fun action shots, interesting music, it's like Bollywood Marvel. 
$C: [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G62HrubdD6o)
$C: That was how I felt when I first saw Shaolin Soccer.
$C: It's a shit movie in the sense that the logic of what happens crumbles under the least bit of scrutiny and everything is hyper-dramatized. 

It has good production values, though. 
$C: Action-comedy-epic
$C: I think you would really like Aamir Khan films! I highly recommend 3 Idiots! It's not "low budget Bollywood crap" at all. It's got a great story, character development, pacing, and intended humour.
$C: Try watching more Bollywood movies. You'll soon realise that every single one is "so bad" and find it not so hilarious. What a sham of a movie industry.
$C: The story is absurd...
$C: :#
$C: > Head Tattoo thingy 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilaka


$C: Lol. That's not a head tattoo. It's like a liquid paste that you apply and it dries. :)
$C: God nipple
$C: My people in make movie in 4k and 8k. There is placed plan to make next year everything from 12k! Indian filming always make new innovativeness.
$C: Also, we are supposed to watch part 1 before part 2. I don't want people to end up at " but why the fuck Kattapa killed Baahubali?"
$C: He's the boss. 
$C: SPEAK PRRREEEIST!!!
$C: This is the Tollywoodest thing I've seen in a while.
$C: Tollywood is the Bollywoodest Bollywood.
$C: It's a Father- Son and sibling saga. Pretty much the same. 
$C: Damn it :c
$C: > If not watch it in Telugu for the lip-sync

Exactly what I was looking for. Thank you.
$C: > baahubali

Not on Latinamerican Netflix either
$C: Weird. They only seem to have Tamil, Hindi, and Malayalam on Netflix. Maybe they have alt audio tracks. 
$C: And then many more were probably put down due to broken legs and what not. Horrific filming conditions for the animals. 
$C: What is this, Ben Hur?
$C: In Hollywood, after the uproar about using trip wire to make horses fall in films (Ben Hur was a bad one) which often resulted in broken legs and necks, stunt horses became a thing.  They were taught to fall on command but it's a totally different type of falling.  The rider turns the head way to the side and the horse falls on the opposite shoulder.  It's all very controlled and the horse is not hurt.  

I'm pretty horrified by this clip.  Many of those horses fell due to trip wire.  And worse many of them crashed face first on hard surfaces.  Some will have broken facial bones, some broken legs, some broken necks.  

$C: M... Maybe those were stunt-horses?
$C: wtf CGI? did you even watch the clip? 
$C: Thats some good cgi
$C: [deleted]
$C: The clip was from another movie.. I was confused for a moment too but fortunately I don't think any animals were harmed in filming the Baahubalis
$C: 10/10
$C: It actually looks amazing.

https://youtu.be/sw6VKIClRMY
$C: Ah okay, thanks.  I asked because it's my friends' native language, but it sounds unlikely that there is anything great they don't already know.  They've been really kind to me, for no reason, and I wish I could find something nice to do for them in return.  
$C: A SHORT MAN FROM TEXAS
$C: Ah yes, I know that one. Thanks. 
$C: Great! Thanks! I can't wait to ask!
$C: Very interesting. Thanks!
$C: Thanks, random internet friend. I would have never known. 
$C: Neither. Telugu is their original language, the movie was dubbed into Tamil and Malayalam. 
$C: None of them is the original language.   

$C: Telugu is the original for this movie  
I think this movie might be in Netflix
Im not sure about it though
$C: My brain went to Tolly-Grunge music
$C: In "North India"?  Do you mean in Hindi?  In Punjabi?

Is Kolkata in North India?  Does Gali mean this bad thing in Bengali?

Anyway it was just a joke.
$C: It's usually based after the place it is in, not the language

Like Bollywood is named after Bombay, the old name of Mumbai
$C: How the fuck did you include Bhojpuri but not Malayalam, Bengali , Kannada and Punjabi? 🙏🙏
$C: I was secretly hoping that the Punjab film industry would be called "Punjabiwood".

The film was _Flying Jatt_.  Sorry if I incorrectly assumed it came from Punjab. 
$C: No. I would say most people are bilingual at the very least with their mother tongue being one and English being the other. People are trilingual if they are inclined to learn Hindi too. 
$C: Just curious -- aren't Hindi and Urdu the same language but with different scripts?
$C: Hindi isn't the national language fyi. There is no national language. 
$C: Thanks for that, I never really understood this properly. It would be like Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar were all joined together into one country.
$C: While I got you here, I was watching an Indian movie the other day. When people greet eachother they reach for their feet? What is that? 
$C: That is half the truth. There were multiple princely kingdoms not under british rule who annexed to the Indian union mostly willingly occasionally by force like Hyderabad and Junagadh. Also multiple times for centuries India has been ruled under kingdoms as big as the Indian british empire mainly during the Guptas and Maurya.
$C: And Sandalwood! 
$C: Dollywood is based in Dhaka, which is in Bangladesh, not India. 

$C: And Smollywood
$C: [deleted]
$C: Both are ridiculous and over the top which is how I feel a proper Telugu movie should be.
$C: If you don’t know any of those languages, then the Telugu version is the better version. Tamil is the next for the movie was shot in both Telugu and Tamil. The others are just dubbed. There was a dubbed Chinese version too. 
$C: Old one are better imo, it's the late late 90's that started this misogynitric  masala trend in Telugu film industry. Since then you can see that Telugu women got ticked off and stopped becoming lead actor's
$C: oh fuck off
$C: Ni bondha
$C: Not exactly, the dravidian language family has the same type of general alphabet. But the words in general are much different, especially when you get away from Hyderabad.
$C: India isn't an ethno-state like Japan/Korea or even a melting-pot like the USA. It's like Europe if the EU was federalised into one country. One of India's official names is *Indian Union* after all. 

So are German and French movies same just because they are in the  EU? Bollywood and Tollywood are completely different industries and draw from different cultures and market to different cultures. 
$C: Wasn't it from the British name for Mumbai being Bombay.
$C: Most of the north indians watch anime in hindi.

$C: First film to break R 2000 crores — around $310 Million (iirc) 

Dangal beat that record few months later. 

Edit: both films together grossed a total 2000 crores-ish
$C: You can't lock up the winter.
$C: I had to nope out when I read "But how did we end lip with a ranger?"
$C: Wait until the US Army unveils some its genetically modified super trees. Literally another 100 years of global dominance right there - people don't realize that the tree race is just starting to heat up. Bad luck for the Chinese given that they wasted decades on their fruitless "Jump on the other end of a teeter-totter for launch" fiasco. 
$C: 21k karma in. Im new to this. 
$C: r/incrediblesmemes
$C: Eh... LotR isn't *that* high fantasy. The Hercules comparison is more apt.
$C: Basically, "not sure if satire or serious"
$C: Most =/= all. Educated and little bit well off people find realism in movies very appealing eg. Movies about events, biographies and so on. This is a  small percentage of the population compared to the majority who work their ass off day in day out. Their reality is worse than those in movies. So they o to movies looking for something extra-ordinary. Filmmakers sell the longing of these people in their movies. I was in that majority. But Now i despise those over the top stuff in movies and root for realism. 
$C: I’ll make sure to watch it with sound in a couple of hours when I get the chance
$C: Ha ha..ok
$C: > Bajirao Mastani

How about some top picks for those wanting to get into it? I love BB1 and 2 and the style of the video, if that helps to guide.
$C: yeah but it doesn't automatically follow they should have a series of names of their own. I speak as an Indian, though I don't find it funny. Just incredibly endearing. :D
$C: No I thought it all fell under Bollywood. 
$C: Faridabad meh kya heh?

$C: Bengali cinema has produced some of the best movies in the world. Half of Satyajit Ray's filmography is God-tier.
$C: Well wikipedia states its 53 % speakers 3rd language included. I read somewhere it was just close to 50 % so dunno. 
$C: I'll check it out, thanks for the tip!!
$C: Oh. I thought a trailer or something leaked.
$C: I'll have to question your friend's taste tbh. Imo, it goes Malayalam >= Tamil (because even though it's a remake, it had a few new things to say and certain things were presented in an interesting way) >>> Hindi. Just the lead actors of the other two (Mohanlal in Malayalam, Kamal in Tamil) over Ajay Devgan makes those two better watches. The script is king in this movie but even there, the Hindi version falls short.
$C: Thanks for the recommendation! Will watch it :)
$C: >What aspect of the movie are you enjoying? The historical aspect of the film? The ridiculous action? The storyline?

I'm not sure. I enjoy the setting and this kind of over the top hero stories (e.g. [The Immortals](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1253864/)). 

>There's also this Padmavati

That looks like fun!

And thank you for the recommendations. I will check them out. 
$C: I highly recommend it. Bump it up your priorities list.
$C: or is it?
$C: And I have seen all the Bhai movies, whats the point here?
$C: They just overdo stuff. Can be cute. But barf indusing after a little while. I mean. In 3 idiots. Insert something happening regarding any mood. Happiness. Then times that by a 100. Same with sadness. Insert instant fake crying eyes on everyone. It's too fake when they try to pull off emotional stuff. It just doesn't work. Less is more!  

That's def something they don't seem to understand the concept of. :)
$C: No I dont mind foreign Films at all. Some of my Favorite Films come out of the Golden Era of South Korea. But the mere flood of  Bollywood movies in the main topics here in America is ridiculous. Netflix in general i say sucks ass.
I mean fine upload movies from everywhere. But if I downvote movies of any kind they should be removed from my feed. And being in many nations then they should cater to those nations movies first before foreign films. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Oh shiiiit
$C: These 2 movies are the best. I've watched them multiple times. Great stories fab action.
$C: yeah netflix tricked me into watching the first one... now I HAVE to see how it ends

$C: This is what I needed to know. Thank u 
$C: Subtitles?  Dubbed?
$C: No sheeeiiiiiit?  
$C: Whelp. I HAD things to do this weekend. 
$C: Came here looking for this info. Thank you! Sick as hell so I'm just gonna lay on the couch and watch this.
$C: Going to Star Wars on Saturday, going to pregame with this.
$C: I wonder which one on Netflix I should watch.  The Hindi Version, the Tamil Version, or the Malayalam Version?  I see all 3 have english subtitles.


$C: AUURGH! Not on Netflix Japan. I clicked the links and they took me to a preview for Troll Hunters.
$C: It's very long and super confusing since the same actor plays multiple generations of himself, but all the surrounding actors are supposed to be the same people just spanning two generations. Honestly just stick to the highlights and don't bother. 
$C: > ey even have the full had video with subtitles on You

sweet ..going to watch it tonight! 
$C: Which country? Not Swedish Netflix :(
$C: Even more omg!!!
$C: Do I need to watch the first movie to understand the second one?
$C: Yes and Bahubali is probably the greatest movie series ever created 
$C: For the sequel my Netflix has the "Tamil" version and the "Malayalam" version.  Which should I watch?  Which language sounds nicer?
$C: I’m totally watching this.
$C: Put it on my watch list!  Thanks!
$C: Thanks!
$C: so sad I don't have them in latin american netflix they look really cool

$C: !remindme
$C: remindme!
$C: Thanks lol now I want to watch lol
$C: Don’t watch hindi version, watch the tamil version. I watched both versions and tamil is way better because most of the actors are speaking im their own voices in tamil but hindi is dubbed by other people. The original version is telugu but that’s not available on Netflix so watch Baahubali part 1&2 (tamil version)
$C: Don’t watch the hindi version, watch the tamil version. I watched both versions and tamil is way better because the actors are speaking in their own voices in tamil but hindi is dubbed by other people. The original version is telugu but that’s not available on Netflix so watch Baahubali part 1&2 (tamil version)
$C: No watch in tamil wayy better
$C: Good job on stealing the top comment from the youtube video. A+ for effort. 

$C: Yes there are also dance but i am sure you will like those too. Cinematography and choreography all fuckin amazing dude. Worth it all
$C: that's not the point, Karan johar distributed it and the entire northern movie-goers were all awaiting it's release.
$C: I have never seen a one-man job done in India without at least 3 people doing it
$C: Nope
$C: Would be better if half of them were CGI. That would still be **600 million** people! :O

$C: Re: SpongeBob

A scene where SpongeBob is sitting in the living room on a chair watching the "nature" channel (displayed on screen it If recall correctly is a sea anemone flailing about). 

Gary enters the scene and meows, catching SpongeBob off guard. Who Jumps and  screams "Gary". While in a hurried fashion searches to find the remote, changes the channel to a football game. Then tells Gary he's watching football.

$C: oh damn! that's actually pretty genius
$C: You're responding to spam.
$C: u/martinsredditaccount they're changing the name style on the bots now it seems.

Lol vote manipulation. 
$C: Most importantly, *it works*. So far as we know, Vader never searches for his children at all, *if he even realizes he has any*. Everything that happens to Luke's home happens because the droids just so happen to land on Tatooine near enough for Jawas to find and carry the to market.

What pushes Luke to finally agree to leave is that he has nothing left on the planet. If his family had still been there, they may well have talked him out of leaving entirely.
$C: Vader wasn't looking for Luke, was he? He was looking for a couple droids. Luke only became relevant later when he started gaining his Force chops. The same goes for Leia. Why put her in a visible royal family if she was a target? And of course the million dollar question: Why did Luke get sent to a desert backwater to farm water or whatever, and Leia got the royal suite? 
$C: that shit is rough

$C: You don't know where Vader is from until the prequels. This is a logic flaw with The Phantom Menace, not A New Hope.

Also kicks to the face are legal in some karate tournament rules. Idk if it's specifically stated they are illegal in the film but otherwise this one is fine.
$C: Yeah, that was in the the link, that you're replying.
$C: The prequels are just dumb as shit and make the OT look weird because of it.

 * Obi Wan 'hides' on Tatooine in Jedi Regalia?
 * Anakin doesn't keep in contact with his step-brother or his step-father, although they had an intimate relationship with his mother?
 * Owen and Baru are very aware of Anakin/Vader, although they don't meet him often, they don't keep in touch with Obi Wan although they should know he is the only one who could stand in Anakin's way if he ever came, but they also don't hide/go somewhere Anakin doesn't know???

$C: I'm gonna build a list here in a bit, but I'll start with [Devdas](https://youtu.be/Jbn39j-xa-k) for now.
$C: I could research it if I wanted to but frankly, I don't care that much. I just think that if you're going to tell someone they're wrong you might as well explain why. I read plenty of comments saying nothing more than it's not Bollywood. You are just the poor soul that I responded to. Sorry.
$C: This is true. Peepli Live is a great example.
$C: More like "Panjabi"
Pronunciation : Panj - abi 

Meaning of Punjab :

Panj means Five

Ab means River (Waters)

So the real meaning is : The Land of Five Rivers

$C: It was a real bank robbery but the Saints were using it as a publicity stunt to promote their movie.
$C: They brought along an actor who was going to play a role in an upcoming Saints movie (I think).  The robbery was real, but everyone else (besides the gang you were robbing from) thought it was a publicity stunt...even when you were mowing down cops.
$C: Weren't they all Gats? And then one Gat pulls off the mask and it's Gat!
$C: The song was released in 1984 in the UK when I was 8 I'm old... 
$C: Wow... I thought it was only a local song from Quebec. Basically « la gadoue » here means the toxic looking brown sludge that used to be snow and that you find in the streets during winter.

$C: As long as you yell no homo, it’s perfectly fine. I’ve gone full penis in a dudes mouth and butt but it was strictly just jokes.
$C: I'm not gay but that dick won't suck itself.
$C: I feel ya.  I always remember to say "No homo".
$C: What if you just had a roaring boner for other men, that doesn't make you gay, right? 
$C: You've got the username of a hopefully gay anime samurai. I feel like that's not a coincidence.
$C: [‘cuz if I ain’t gay, then I ain’t gay.](https://youtu.be/eiuS-qOxOsY)
$C: "No I'm not *gay*, just my mouth is gay."
$C: Not only that I'm not gay but I've never even fucked a gay dude. I did however fuck a guy that fucked a gay and he told me straight guys like ourselves are much better screw than gays, so screw gay.
$C: I’ll show you how straight I am!
$C: I've been trying to explain this to my wife for years! She still doesn't get it...
$C: I certainly don't mess around with girls either. Girls like penis, and that's super gay. I'm not getting involved with anything that gay, that would be gay AF.
$C: He isn't gay. But I heard his boyfriend is
$C: Just say no homo
$C: Hey man $5 is $5.
$C: I dooooo

$C: They were doing a worship that involves pouring water on that giant statue. The guy didn't like that his adopted mother had to keep on climbing with buckets to the waterfall, so he picked up the (likely several ton) statue and moved it to the waterfall.
$C: He's actually telling the truth
$C: Thanks for the clarification. As someone who isn't well versed in indian culture (due to being as far removed from india, geographically speaking, as is humanly possible on this planet) I suddenly enjoyed and appreciated this scene as a moment of character and emotional strength. 

I am still proud of my original comment though.

$C: >not really a comedy

Intention differs from execution, I guess
$C: So it's like a live-action anime?
$C: Just binged both and I can safely say part 2 is even better
$C: "High budget" is relative though. Google says the budget for this movie was 35M$. Apparently, the average budget of a hollywood movie is 100M$. I'm not defending shitty moviemaking and graphics but it's worth remembering that almost no other country pours the amount of money into movies as Hollywood does. 


Edit: Turns out this was the highest budget film of its time! So you can see why the graphics and stuff for the average Indian (or most foreign) movies aren't that great. 
$C: Kinda like crouching tiger hidden dragon.
$C: Bollywood always adds slight comedy with how OTT it is, like old Bond films
$C: Tollywood stands for "Tibet hollywood" for those who don't know.

Edit: it's apparently actually Telugu hollywood, I don't know shit 
$C: See that's the thing, it is to us. But in their culture, this is a perfectly normal action movie. All their action movies are like this.
$C: Tilaka is a mixture of water and Vermilion which is applied on your forehead for religious purposes. :)
$C: Yes, but who is able to watch any movie in 12k? Even (mostly), only wealthy people can watch 4k now. 
$C: I had to download a family tree because casting prabhas as both father and son and not demarkating them in anyway was confusing as fuck.
$C: Played by the same guy too!
$C: Its available on YouTube in 4k. Search Baahubali
$C: Its there on Youtube, not sure if its available everywhere though

$C: >Horrific filming conditions for the animals. 

IKEA needed meat.
$C: No they were not.  Stunt horses are taught to fall in a particular way and the cue given by the rider is to turn the head way to one side and the horse falls on the opposite shoulder.  It's also done on dirt.  Stunt horse falling: https://imgur.com/a/wGUep

To get horses to crash like this (face first on hard surfaces) requires trip wire.  This kind of shit results in broken bones and dead horses.  

The ones that are not killed and injured will be seriously messed up for riding.  They will be jumpy, hesitant about running under saddle and likely scared of going faster than a timid trot on asphalt.  
$C: I had hoped they were. But, no. :( They used real horses. 
$C: Just communicating the relevant information I saw in the film, man. Simmer.
$C: My bad. I thought we were still talking about Baahubali. Imma dummy who apparently cannot follow comment threads! Apologies. My information applies only to the Baahubali movies.
$C: Oh man. The battle scene in this film is so good. 
$C: Aight that looks pretty sick.
$C: A MAN OF THE WILD
$C: A bunch of films you might want to ask his opinion about before you watch. 

-	Pellichoopulu : A nice breezy slice of life story. It’s well made with nice music. 
-	Kanche : A story set in WW2 period. It shows some subtle parallels about how conflicts between large groups of people like the Nazis and Jews are quite similar to routine daily conflicts in the villages. 
-	Eega : A man is killed by a dude who eyes his lover. He is reincarnated as a fly and proceeds to take revenge. 
-	Arjun Reddy : A story about a surgeon who destroys his career with a breakup and his alcohol and drug addiction. The highlight of this film is that the lead actor is I believe the best “actor” among all the regular leads in Telugu Cinema. 
$C: Wasn't it concurrently made in Tamil and Telugu, then dubbed into Malayalam, since the actors also spoke Tamil? I watched the Tamil version and many scenes weren't dubbed (i.e. the lip movements matched the words being said).
$C: I've been on a Nirvana/Soundgarden kick lately, and now I really, really want Bengali grunge music.
$C: సార్ Southie here, isn't gaali a common word across North?
$C: Flying Jatt is a Bollywood movie. It is made in Hindi. Not Punjabi. 
$C: More than half of the people here speak Hindi. English isn't that common. Bilingualism with Hindi and the native language is far more common.
$C: You’re correct they differ mainly in script, Hindi is Devanagari and Urdu is Arabic, but there are slight grammatical and inflection  differences that make them differentiable when spoken even to someone like me who only knows a smidge of Hindi. 
$C: Even better would be if the Chinese invaded Europe in the 18th century and left Europe in the 20th century. In the process they united Europeans into one country because they all hated Chinese more than each other. Replace China with British and Europe with India. 
$C: You pay respect to your elders by touching their feet. 
$C: It's a sign of showing respect towards elders like mother and father. It reduced to a large extent these days.
$C: Many people will think you're joking, but Sandalwood is a real term to describe the Kannada film industry

$C: He's right though. Those picks are really all over the place :) Also surprised there's not RGV in that list -- I think his stuff has more global appeal from what I've seen.
$C: Okay. Thanks.
$C: Man that was a fair warning. I have recommended movies to some friends before and all of them complained of the ladies thing being too cringey. And you can ask me to fuck off, but you and I both know that its true.

$C: >  whats the point here?

You tell me.

And as far as bhai movies are concerned, they are just road side junk lapped up by daily wage laborers. (no offense intended towards RSL)
$C: > They just overdo stuff.

I agree. Have myself been watching only 2-3 of the latest Hindi movies annually, and not all of em are at the theaters either (have found Indian parallel cinema of yore to have some superb movies, and they hardly get any traction.)

3 Idiots tackled the issue which has been prevalent in India, so many things got overlooked + accepted due to gen ways of the public (Yes, we got emotional people here). But it still impressed many people outside of India. A lot of people have seen this movie and I have heard only from you abt being 'abs not impressed', so it is surprising.

I again agree that there were some or the other incidents which made people, including me, go - "Was this needed?" .. but the movie still scored.
$C: Sometimes, my friends and I pick something foreign to us to watch. It changes up the selection. Last week, we watched a movie about a last dragon that kidnaps a princess and they fall in love. I believe it was Russian. I think I'll present these Bollywood flicks next week.

$C: You’re never as gay as the guy sucking your dick. 
$C: Actually bro, you might want to consult a doctor for that one
$C: They said it'd never happen.
$C: It's also the symbol of Shiva. Linga(penis) and Yoni(vagina) mating together is a holy symbol in Hinduism, it's basically Indian version of yin and yang and represents the world (creation and destruction). 
$C: Random Indian agrees 
$C: Based off no context i greatly enjoyed your comment. This particular movie has a special place in my heart. It is just too perfect
$C: Yeah, I made a mistake typing it out. It is lingham on yoni.
$C: 300 meets Fast and Furious minus cars and Paul Walker
$C: 300 had an ogre though
$C: Add in the epicness of Ben Hur.  And definitely not a comedy.  There are a few parts that are kind of cheesy, so you'll laugh at them.  But most of it is REALLY good action, acting, directing, etc...  The story in the first movie gets a bit hard to follow in a few spots, probably something lost in translation with the subtitles, but the second movie ties it all together nicely, and it all makes pretty good sense.  I believe both movies are on Netflix though.  They're totally worth watching.
$C: 300 is a good example. A less dark and gritty version.
$C: "over the top" doesn't quite cover it!!
$C: To be honest, 300 felt underwhelming after watching Bahubali. 
$C: In the 80s & 90s, Hong Kong flicks were the go-to for insane, cool-yet-funny action.  But with CGI maturing, looks like India is taking things even further.
$C: What's comedic for an American might not be comedic for an Indian. 
$C: Yeah I definitely meant relative to the average Tollywood movies that are pumped out like clockwork.
$C: But if you adjust for the difference in costs, that $35M probably went a lot further
$C: Yeah, according to wikipedia:

>The film was made on a budget of ₹180 crore (US$28 million), making it the most expensive Indian film at its time of release. The film opened worldwide on 10 July 2015, garnering critical acclaim and record breaking box office success.

So, definitely high budget within its genre.

$C: > average budget of a hollywood movie is 100M$

A significant part of the US-budget goes to the main actors alone. Off the top of my head, I know that Arnhold Schwarzenegger was paid 30M for Judgement Day... in 1991. 

I would assume that the Indian actors will get a tiny fraction of that.

Visual effects aren't that expensive these days.
$C: The movie is actually good though and a lot of fun with a character focused plot, minus the leaps in logic it took with science. 
$C: You do have to keep in mind that the rupee is worth less than the dollar and 35$ mil goes a much longer way in India than in America. But probably not enough to make up for that gap
$C: Duh.. labor in India is cheap bro!! most people will be lucky to be paid 1/4th the amount Hollywood guys do.. 35M$ goes a long way!! A lot of CGI in Hollywood is outsourced to India (too) anyways so I doubt it's budget that is the reason for crappy graphics in Indian movies.. It just requires time and effort to create good graphics. Indian industry isn't there yet!! 
$C: You should be able to make a reasonable AA video game with that amount of money, so a movie should do just fine with it.
$C: We've also got some of the best visual fx teams in the world here. (US)
$C: *Triggered*

Its telugu you fools. Bollywood is different from tollywood

$C: You are right. Actors for three of the seven main characters are tamilians , and the remaining actors too know a bit Tamil, so it was made concurrently in Tamil as well the original telugu. All other languages like Kannada, Malayalam, hindi are dubbed.
$C: Honestly no idea haha, just trying to figure it out myself.
$C: That’s in the North. Come beyond Telangana into the South. Bilingualism with English and the mother tongue is more common here. 
$C: When south Indians speak Hindi  it's basically a few words that will get you by. They can't hold a conversation in Hindi. Hell I can't understand Modi's speeches or Hindi news and I am much better at Hindi than average south Indians. 
$C: Do they understand each other though? As in, one who speaks Urdu and one who speaks Hindi. Like Italian and Spanish.
$C: In the cities maybe, it's still extensive in rural India. 
$C: Yeah I know, I was not at all joking in my comment. 
$C: all this talking is giving me wood.
$C: Shiva was his first movie. After that, RGVs next few movies, satya, sarkar, and rahkt charitra are very much geared towards a Bollywood audience.
$C: What can I say. We are a billion people of sexist cis gendered pigs compared to the oh so enlightened and progressive USA.
$C: Er thanks?
$C: Nah bro. Ni = your ; bondha = grave
 
The grave word here is used as a connotation. 
 
The english equivalent of Ni bondha would be, "/r/bestof my ass". Not exactly the exact translation but you get the idea.
$C: Bondha means grave. He is saying 'your grave', it's a bad word. But , yes he is also calling you fat, but that's because you are fat, Mr Bulger
$C: I am trying to educate not being pedantic. I am not a foreigner who generally wouldn't know or care about a culture half the world away. These differences are all very real to me because I fucking live here. 

Wow what an ignorant asshole. If you didn't care then you shouldn't have posted incorrect shit.
$C: I know. 
$C: It was a joke
$C: And somehow Your Pretentious Holiness is the authority when it comes to classifying entertainment as "junk" so that "daily wage laborers" can consume what they are worthy of. This is not to say that Bhai makes good movies, he doesn't. This is just to point out the fact that you are one of the most pathetic examples of the so-called "intellectuals of India".
$C: The "was this still needed" moments. They became more and more frequent, to the point of it being really distracting for me. It's shit acting. And trying to do fake wet eyes and look stupid, just doesn't cut it when you try to sell something emotionel on screen. It don't flow for me, when you can see and feel a movie tackling difficult subjects, then half assing the acting. To me it's disrespectful to the themes. But I mean, it's perhaps the best they can do. But I just think it sucks tbh.

Perhaps some day they stop being live action cartoons. (We already have cartoons for that, and they do that shit a billion times better) And perhaps then succeed in portraying and making stories about serious subjects. (Fun can still apply to such themes, but just ake it. Tasteful. And well. Good.)  

Edit. I had the movie recommended by my mother, she absolutely loved it. Thought it was a fantastic movie. I'm just a lot more critical. One of my biggest passions in life is storytelling. So I'm very critical, and probably have higher than most peoples standards. (I've spend too much of my life inside other stories, and forgot to live my own).. Or more like.. I prefer it like this, my own like is not interesting. :D
$C: I used to do that with some buds we watched some great ones like the man from nowhere
$C: Not Bollywood (Hindi language), search for Baahubali in Telugu language. Hindi is dubbed version, hence no lipsync
$C: This movie (both parts) is very awesome and full of weird crazy shit like this. Trust me, totally worth the view.
$C: lmfaoo my Indian parents watched this movie last weekend and my brother and I spent the entirety of it obnoxiously ripping into the movie and making fun of "Indian cinema". Always odd to see stuff being more appreciated than I thought.  
$C: So... Did a plumber intervene?
$C: I tried watching Hisss on Netflix. I couldn't make it through. 
$C: What movie was it?
$C: Movie Name: Baahubali
The Beginning - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5FvgdI6h-c
The Conclusion - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9770lB6E2M

This is the original. It is originally a South Indian Telugu Movie(Tollywood) Dubbed in Hindi(Bollywood). #justsaying

$C: But I don't see that one on Netflix.  Maybe Tamil then.

$C: I really liked 300.  But I agree, Baahubali is even better.  I was really shocked that Bollywood is capable of producing something this good.
$C: Haha brother, you've brought in Tollywood to a website that only knows Bollywood. Now we will have to explain Kollywood, Sandalwood, Mollywood, etc.
$C: We all know that nollywood is where it's at 
$C: Yeah but not as much as $300 million (justice league), especially considering so much of the work is done by the same CGI artists in India and China.
$C: Yeah that's fair. I'm perfectly willing to believe that they suck lol, just wondering if there's any other reason. 
$C: Thanks man. I was trying that thing where you post the wrong answer and then get the right one, because I was too lazy to google it lol
$C: Then what’s Tamilian Hollywood?
$C: Tagalog?
$C: I don't think they were being serious. It's Telugu Hollywood. 
$C: You're missing my point entirely. It's not about the quality of the movie, it's about the grandiose-ness of the action scenes. They are relatively normal for serious films coming out of some asian movie production scenes. It's ridiculous to us, but to them they find our action movies to be rather bland and boring based off what a friend from that culture told me.
$C: In comparison to the rest of the world? Probably. 
$C: Forgot that. That should be in this list too. 

-	Leader : The son of a dead CM comes back to India and contests the election over corrupt opponents. Nice music with a beautiful rendition/remix of “Maa Telugu Talliki”, the state song of the Telugus. 
$C: Yeah but that is very little population wise. Most people are bilingual with mother tongue and hindi
$C: other than south, most non hindi natives usually have some understanding of the language.
$C: I'm talking about entire India, not South or North. I'm aware that Southies don't speak that much Hindi.
$C: Yes they understand each other very easily. The difference is mainly of a few words for nouns and verbs. So to a Hindi speaker Urdu sounds like Hindi with some fancy words that he/she rarely uses and vice versa. 
$C: Hindi and urdu are basically same language but different scripts and different source of vocabulary.

$C: > This is just to point out the fact that 

You need to clear your head. These are my personal opinions. And you can keep thinking what you want to abt the caustic remark I made abt 'daily wage laborers'. The sharpest of the decline in Indian movies is something for everybody to see. Rohit shetty having the gall to say that he makes movies for the common man, while doling one BS after another is because of their discovery of catering to the lowest common denominator.
$C: > she absolutely loved it. Thought it was a fantastic movie. I'm just a lot more critical. 

I was thinking about this stuff a while back. I have heard people brought up on even the good old diet of Noir genre liking a fully loaded movie like 'Kabhi Khushi, Kabhi Gham' .. and that made me feel confused - At least people here can expect some people around the world liking movies which are the least expected to find favor. 

>One of my biggest passions in life is storytelling. So I'm very critical, and probably have higher than most peoples standards.

Then yours is indeed a case which won't allow for things to slip by unnoticed. This context was necessary in your first comment itself. Back then, it appeared coming from an innocuous movie watcher. ;)

$C: Well, I was thinking more about the guns on the Gunslinger in The Dark Tower (the books, even the comics, not the disgraceful movie) as they have Sandalwood (I hope that I'm not confusing the words)...

But, that was a nice, and unexpected TIL
$C: great response
$C: Asking a question first is how indians argue politely. Directly explaining things in a non student-teacher setting is taken as an insult to intelligence and insensitive.  He was being a good guy.
$C: I wish they were just your personal opinions, but the rotten pretentiousness has spread everywhere. Every industry churns out movies that cater to the lowest common denominator. And those movies bring in the money to do experimental movies. And let's face it when was the last time where you paid to watch the movies you deem are good movies? Bollywood is doing good progress in the sense where there have been plenty of movies. Good stories has been blended well enough with the masalas so that regular audiences, and not just pretentious snobs, can truly enjoy their time.
$C: Thanks a lot for the suggestions. Been enjoying this conversation. :)

Nice to see people on the internet who don't just hate when you have different oppinions, but can discuss things in a civilised manner.  

I can be very critical. But I think of course, it's only when it's called for. I have "guilty" pleasures. But those are stupid things, which knows they are stupid. And to me. They just work. :) Again an issue I have with the Bollywood films I've seen. It seems like they really try sometimes to tackle serious stuff. But it falls flat on the head because of poor direction and acting. And well the over instant pan away then back then fully watery fake eyes. Doesn't really help. :D Again. Less is sometimes better. :D Unless again, if you intentionally does something over the top cartoonish. But to me it seems like they "try" to be serious, but failing horribly. Perhaps I just don't "get it".

I have a huge love for comedy/dramas, which can do both equally well. (Bojack Horseman) When it does serious stuff, there can be a funny thing. But they knock the serious shit out of the fucking park. The writing and deliveries is spot on. Doesn't seem "fake".  

Adding you as friend, even though I have no idea what to do what that here on Reddit. But you're a cool guy, so yeah. :D

Have a great one man, I'm off to bed!

Oh I thought I would mention a "guilty" pleasure of mine. The Last Man On Earth. :D Mostly just for the pure comedy, sometimes it's just so funny. :p Had one of the funniest scenes I've seen in years. Laughed my ass off. But yeah. It doesn't have much more than just being funny, so it's just something I like. But can be super funny. :p
$C: Beats the plain ol shit out of some.  Beats the ever loving shit out of others.

$C: Plenty do and grow up to become lawyers.
$C: India has a massive cine industry that churns out a 1000 movies a year (90%of it absolute garbage). As we speak many languages we have different 'woods', Kollywood is Kodambakkamwood or the Tamil industry. Tollywood is Teluguwood aka the Telugu industry...so on and so forth. 
$C: There are different movie industries for the different languages in India. For eg:Tollywood is the industry for the Telugu language films.
$C: In my opinion Bollywood produces the most shitty movies compared to rest of Kollywood, Mollywood and Tollywood. 
$C: Underrated comment
$C: The Kannada film industry
$C: One of these things is not just another one
$C: Wait. Isn’t that Kerala Hollywood?
$C: Sorry for the wrong info. I didn't know what I was talking about lol
$C: > last time where you paid to watch the movies you deem are good movies? 

Last month. 

>Every industry churns out movies that cater to the lowest common denominator.

Sure they do, but the level of ridiculousness is for everybody to see where they have landed. 
$C: >  But it falls flat on the head because of poor direction and acting.

Don't even get me started abt these. I have switched off movies within minutes due to the director's incompetence (sometimes the oncoming trainwreck do give a sound warning). That, coupled with inclusion of cliched stuff (catering to the lowest common denominator), is such a severe disappointment. Earlier, it used to be only a bad movie.. now it is more about wastage of my time, and the resources+money by the makers. Add to the mix that world cinema has improved by leaps and bounds AND has archive stuff to fall back on for guidance/inspiration/ideas.. the revulsion is at a new level. Too many topics have been ruined due to their stupid approach.

> Been enjoying this conversation. :)

Same here. Will put your id in the friends list as well. Good to bump into people who know their stuff. I have kept Bojack and Last man on earth aside for rain check purposes. Gonna clear up schedule, and will proceed to enjoy em like a fine wine. Thanks for reaffirming the faith in these two. Def slotted for a watch sooner now.

Cheers mate! 
$C: Gotcha
$C: my favorite is Mollywood, for malayalam, in which all the movies are three-hour song and dance palindromes. 
$C: Also don't forget that Tollywood is the one with the wacky over the top action.
$C: Please forgive the ignorance... 

But wouldn't it make more sense to make movies in Hindi to reach a broader audience?  Or is the context of this particular film more in line with states that primarily speak Telugu?  Do movies in India typically get dubbed in other languages (domestically that is)?

EDIT:  I keep reading through the thread and found answers to my questions.  I also see that Netflix has 3 different language versions of the movie too.
$C: > Kodambakkamwood

Now it seems like you're just making shit up.  They really have words that long in India?  ;)

That's almost as bad as the German word Rindfleischetikettierungsueberwachungsaufgabenuebertragungsgesetz
$C: It's because you haven't seen the shit that comes of Tamil and Telugu film industry. Though one can argue that Bengali and Malayalam cinema have much better quality to shit ratio.
$C: Wouldn't that be Maplewood?
$C: That is Mollywood
$C: And why can't the movies be ridiculous? Why do they need to take themselves so seriously? Movies are a make-believe world, not all of them needs to be "grounded in reality".
> Last month.
What movie? How did you pay? And even if you are telling the truth, you are nothing but an exception.
$C: I completely agree. It is just at this day of age, so many film makers has gotten so far ahead. The gap from good to bad seems bigger than ever. So many lazy cliches thrown our ways. Stupid one-liners reused because of lazy writing. Movies and TV can be a beautiful thing, but god damn can it also be atrocious. :D  

Like I said. Last Man On Earth might be an acquired taste. It's the awkward, have to look away type of humor. So you need to like that sort of humor to be able to enjoy it. If that's your type of humor, the show is great fun. Fun characters, some might be a bit 2-dimensional. But the comedy works, and that's mostly what the shows seems to be set out to do.

Regarding Bojack Horseman. IMO it's the greatest told story, I've witnessed since Breaking Bad. You can never really judge a show before it's finished, since it can go real shit real fast. But so far, what I've seen has been truly amazing. It literally had me jumping out of my couch, with tears pouring out my face out of pure joy. I'm not even sure that has ever happened to me before. The show can be soulcrushing, but also completely opposite. I won't go into further details if I where to ruin this currently masterpiece to you.  

I am however blundered about it not having a higher score on IMDb. It's an amazing piece of art. I think the whole setup just puts people off. Look beyond the sillyness of the setup, and you'll find one of the deepest character portrayals out there, with amazingly well made, fully fleshed out side characters. (I think the shows beat Breaking Bad regarding side characters, they all are build so well from the ground up through the seasons) I get the shivers right now, just thinking about how well done it is. How much sense it makes, the characters. First you see how the characters are. Then you find out, really who they are. Why and how they've become who they are. Everything comes together so naturally. I hope the show will continue it's path. The show, just like Breaking Bad, has only become better and better.

I can go on rants about shows I really like or dislike. Well I won't really get started, but I'd just like to mention since I wrote shit can go bad, real fast for good tv-shows. The show Dexter is a great example. Duo to family isues (being away from family over half a year every year). The showrunner of Dexter season 1-4 had to leave the show. And the guy who took over, completely ruined it's direction. It's feel. Well it simply just turned the greatest potential show out there at the moment, into complete and utter shit. (full of ciches, main character going through the same shit over and over, instead of progessing him and story forward) It's still soemthing that to this day makes me sad. Was so hyped, but then let down. First four seasons where amazing though. But I've never been able to rewatch it because of the shitstain that was season 5-8. I did watch season 1-4 several times before the later ones ruined everything. So I have those sweet memories still. But.. Shows should just end if they loose the one whos holding everything together, or the main core. Instead of making something really shitty. It's disrespectful, pretty much only a cashgrab at this point. But ruins the legacy of the show.
$C: > three-hour song and dance palindromes

explain now pls
$C: Because the other languages also have a large enough market size. Think of it as.... The European Cinema market. You have English movies that are massive, but you also have Polish, French, Irish etc etc movies right? Same logic. 
$C: They do make films in Hindi - that's what Bollywood is.
$C: All Indians don't have similar culture, so what works for one group might not work for another group. A Kannada movie goer might not enjoy a Hindi based on Mumbai underworld, but he will definitely love it if it is based on Bangalore underworld.
$C: It is not a single word.

Kodambakkam is the name of the place. So Kollywood to make it similar to Hollywood.

Noone really calls it Kodambakkamwood.

And also.. What does that german word mean? 
$C: Good one, eh? 
$C: >why can't the movies be ridiculous?

If you cannot understand the importance of the LEVEL of ridiculousness, then this convo will be very difficult, and won't head anywhere.

>  What movie? **How did you pay?** 

>And *even if you are telling the truth, you are nothing but an exception.*

Have you lost your marbles? 
$C: it's a joke about how all Indian movies are three hour affairs combined with a riff on how Malayalam (language in Mollywood movies) is a palindrome. Sorry to anyone who was disappointed and expecting actual musicals made entirely of palindromes. 
$C: Yeah, I know that.  I didn't form my initial question very well unfortunately.  I really meant this particular movie (not all Indian movies) since it appears to be a big budget film.  


$C: A quick google came up with "law delegating beef label monitoring". Less exciting than I had hoped, but given that it's Germany, more exciting than I expected.
$C: It's amazing some of the words they come up with in some places.  That German word takes the cake though.  In German, they just keep tacking on words and sometimes it can end up getting pretty ridiculous.

Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateapokaiwhenuakitanatahu is a mountain in New Zealand.

I just find some of these names amusing, I bet the history is interesting in how they come up with such a mouthful of word for one thing.  Or it could be something like Mr. Deeds where Winona Ryder makes up her childhood town, and just keeps adding things to it.  Winchestertonfieldville.
$C: Then maybe just explain with examples what's your definition of ridiculousness is.

Well, in a country known for piracy, it's a fair question. Did you go to a theatre? Did you pay a legal streaming service? Also what movie are we talking about here?

$C: To make this up to us, you must now go write one. Hop to it.
$C: Went for the movie Newton. Saw it in a theater, and paid cash for it. No discount availed via e-wallets/coupons/CC etc. Took a non-lounge seat, and was not a front row seat either. I did not fish out my mobile phone to check the notifications, didn't took/made any calls and ofc made sure that it was on silent mode throughout.

Anything else your highness?

Now, if I am indeed an exception, def my opinions are not worth discarding.. not at least just like that eh? Cuz going by your definition, I am having some worthy traits. And I again repeat the stance I had taken earlier about the rohit sh(i)tty type movies targetting the daily wage laborers type janta.

>in a country known for piracy

That ll be the USA.
$C: A man, a plan, a canal; Panama!

I’m out
$C: > That'll be the USA.
 
I think that establishes how your opinions are out of touch with reality. And what constitutes "daily wage laborers type janta"?
$C: The hero we deserve.
$C: >  I think that establishes how your opinions are out of touch with reality

pffft.. The level of desp.. to bundle apple and oranges together. Go and google some data. USA indeed has the distinction. Saw a map complete with per capita based pushpins, and I too was surprised that USA stood that firmly on bucaneering land. Even if results have changed a bit, USA still features above India or very prominently at the least. That said, India is not very far behind in grabbing that crown.

>And what constitutes "daily wage laborers type janta"?

Bhai fans esp, and the ones giving rohit shetty type *movie makers* the impetus to carry on.


Now, you can go and keep re-reading what we spoke about. Really not the types to repeat n say what I already have. You have a desire to keep going on regarding stupid movies are justified, no matter what sort of stupidity is being shown. The last bit was and still is my bone of contention with the current crass movies of India.

You can disagree with my opinion, don't care. Have mentioned all that was required.
$C: You are out of touch with reality. The USA has the distinction in software piracy, so its the number of people who use mostly cracked Windows or Adobe software. We are talking about media here. In India even people who don't have computers take part in piracy indirectly. Maybe they don't download it themselves, but they get it from people who do and spread it. You need to google before speaking.

And you, sir/ma'am/whatever you prefer, are pretentious. The sooner you realize it, the better. Just because people like you and me enjoy Newton, do you expect everyone to just go and see Newton? People are different, they have different taste and if they enjoy it, give it to them. At the end of the day, a huge part of the box office comes from people like them buying legitimate tickets for watching those movies,  instead of just getting them on a thumb drive. And even the crass movies has improved a lot.
