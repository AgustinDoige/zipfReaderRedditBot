This is what happens when one company owns dozens of local news stations

$C: Here's the list of [ALL Sinclair stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stations_owned_or_operated_by_Sinclair_Broadcast_Group).

I was forwarded a link to the [WLOS] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WLOS) of Ashville, NC [broadcast version] (https://youtu.be/JA80HnzudA4?t=33), which did not appear in the Deadspin compilation.
$C: This is an issue, isn't it
$C: [deleted]
$C: The standardization of the media is a very scary thing.
$C: *There is nothing wrong with your television. Do not attempt to adjust the picture. We are now controlling the transmission. We control the horizontal and the vertical. We can deluge you with a thousand channels or expand one single image to crystal clarity and beyond. We can shape your vision to anything our imagination can conceive.*
$C: Well that was creepy as fuck
$C: When all the talking heads were speaking at once I got the willies
$C: Am I watching Black mirror
$C: Whoever edited this did a great job.
$C: I hope this becomes one of the most upvoted videos on reddit

Edit: I hope Ewan McGregor reprises his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi

Edit part 2: GOLD JERRY! GOLD!
$C: Don't worry guys, once they see this they will make sure to change up the wording a little when they collude so this doesn't happen again.
$C: >This is extremely dangerous to our democracy

At least they were correct
$C: Sinclair Broadcast Group owns nearly 200 stations in 80 different markets.  Here's a [list of all their stations.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stations_owned_or_operated_by_Sinclair_Broadcast_Group)
$C: Did... did I just join a cult? 
$C: I really didn’t think this video was going to be as disturbing as it is
$C: The author of this video should win an award. The way they managed to present all the anchors saying something that we clearly can hear as the same phrase, but then synchronized everyone to say in unison the “this is extremely dangerous to our democracy” really sold the message.

It can’t look more brain wash than that.

$C: Hello? This was just removed from #1 on /r/all? What just happened? 84k upvotes within 3 hours and over 10 golds, and it's not #1? Reddit???

Edit: I don't see it on /r/videos now either? what the hell is going on...

Edit2: yeah, it was removed on r/all and r/videos long enough for the majority of people to forget about it, then restored, but is no longer displayed at the top. This is some serious bullshit

Edit3: It has 248k upvotes, and should be #1 top of all time. BUT IT'S NOT.
$C: Thats some scary shit. This is extremely dangerous to our Democracy. 
$C: The FCC had a rule that limited one group from controlling more than 39% of the broadcast TV market. Something about it being dangerous to something. 

Then Ajit Pai gave Sinclair permission to expand beyond that. Now they are trying to merge for a combined coverage of 72% of US households.

$C: I work for a Sinclair station (naivety getting out of college before it turned into this monster.)

We all hate this too. 

Edit: I should’ve thought of this sooner, but [here’s](http://wjla.com/content-concerns)  that content concerns page. Give Sinclair the feedback they crave. 
$C: [removed]
$C: Its very ironic, the message they are trying to convey directly contradicts what they are doing.

$C: Removed? Bullshit. This isn't about politics, it's about journalism.
$C: This is amazing and it’s actually “extremely dangerous to our democracy”.
$C: In before r/videos mods remove this because of.. I don't know, they'll create a reason.
$C: It's like They Live.


$C: Why the fuck is this removed for politics?
$C: This is scary.
$C: I knew it was bad, but I didn't realize it was *THIS* bad.  These people will literally read whatever is on the teleprompter, and it's the same script.

I hate to say it, but I think it's time to break up Sinclair Broadcasting or any other broadcast network of similar scope, because this kind of consolidation in media outlets is truly dangerous, and they're becoming too good at circumventing laws that are meant to limit it.

Unsurprisingly, [Ajit Pai at the FCC has expressed a wish to deregulate media ownership rules](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/technology/fcc-media-ownership-rules.html), meaning it's set to do the opposite and to get worse.  We are witnessing an ever-expanding takeover of local media organizations.

I'd say this is extremely dangerous to our democracy, but I think that's been said enough.  :-)
$C: 90% of the media we consume is owned by 6 companies.

Good infographic.
http://www.dailyinfographic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/media-infographic.jpg
$C: This is such a powerful video. 
$C: So disturbing. Propaganda machine on full blast. 
$C: Wow! Very well put together, thank you for the post OP
$C: Yeah this is what actual propaganda looks like, folks.  Not this new, bullshit, watered-down definition of "propaganda" that everyone likes to use on Reddit to attack a news article they disagree with.

No this is *real* propaganda.  When nefarious powerful minds coordinate scripted reporting throughout the nation designed to influence the opinions and actions of the general public for their own private gain.  This is what it looks like.  And if you thought Fox News was bad, this is going to make Fox look like Reuters by comparison.
$C: Is this fucking Sinclair again? Fuck those guys! 
$C: This is definitely the something that shouldn't have been removed.
$C: who's sinclair?
$C: This is extremely dangerous to r/Democracy
$C: We are the Borg...
$C: [deleted]
$C: must be fun to be a sock puppet
$C: Did some mod just try to remove the video? And then another undid the attempt?

Or was this a "genuine mistake"? What's going on here?

$C: Aaaaand it's gone
$C: These robots are reciting a message so intellectually lazy they've reduced the propaganda to the equivalent of a *Sexy Singles near* </insert%location> *want to meet You!* pop-up ad. And the message is just as fake. 
$C: These pretzels are making me thirsty. 
$C: This was removed???? YO FUCK THE MODS!!!

Edit: WE BACK!!!
$C: 1984 is here.

$C: Did this get taken down?
$C: This needs to be in r/horror as well. Scary shit. 1984 in 2018
$C: Black mirror season 5 stuff right here
$C: Seriously mods? Don't wait until a thread reaches #1 on the front page and 5000+ comments to lock it. Lock it well before that point or not at all.
$C: There's a reason why the USA is ranked 43rd when it comes to freedom of the press. All media (TV, magazines, radio, newspapers) is owned by 6 large companies. There is no freedom of the press. You are fed what the 1% wants you to know. https://rsf.org/en/ranking

$C: OBEY
$C: "and obviously because we're the ones talking about this, it means we're not biased or one sided, and we always check our facts before releasing a story. You can trust us, we love you."
$C: Did this just disappear from the front page and /r/videos?
$C: Holy fuck

$C: They're right, what I just saw IS extremely dangerous to democracy. 
$C: Oh wow geese it is now back up. Here is them deleting the thread, making a statement, me calling them bad, and them deleting their statement and locking the thread:

Censorship is OK aparently until it gets too much attention. 


$C: Did this disappear from the main page? All of a sudden I refreshed and it was gone 
$C: Fuck Sinclair. 
$C: Removed for "No Politics?" One could argue that it's an issue of consolidation.....................
$C: Oh hello USA, this is the result of the slow but steady rape of your anti trust laws over the past decades.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. Thanks for posting.
$C: *"We are the borg"*
$C: This is extremely dangerous for their monopoly
$C: Removed? anyone seeing this post?
$C: Just like when you drink a Coke in Seattle, Boise or Chicago, you expect it to taste identical. Now you can enjoy the same wonderful consistency with your news: never mind what channel you prefer, you’ll be served the same, pre-processed, and patriotically adjusted information. Hail Hydra.
$C: This is extremely dangerous hypocrisy.
$C: What in the fuck is going on with this post ???
$C: Why did this show up on my front page and then get removed?  Why is it marked as disturbing content?

Mods, WTF are you doing and why is this being hidden?
$C: This isn’t just massively ironic, reflexive projection. This is an identified authoritarian propaganda strategy to paint all sources as agenda-driven and biased. Putin has used it in Russia to destroy any expectation of objective truth and the US right has seeded it for years domestically through their constant proclamations of media bias and ever increasing anti-factual leanings. 


$C: [removed]
$C: I’m glad everybody is having the reaction that this is disturbing. Sent shivers down my spine...
$C: After reading some of the comments in here, somehow this video was too subtle for a few people to get the message it was trying to convey.
$C: GUYS I THINK SINCLAIR HAS A THING WITH REDDIT

THE MODS JUST REMOVED THIS

$C: hmmm - unlocked now ?

fuck you mods, this is extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: I don't trust reddit.


Edit: why did this post disappear from all for a bit? 
$C: [deleted]
$C: “Disturbing content” flair my ass
$C: E Corp strikes again!
$C: Turn off the TV. "V for Vendetta" was not supposed to be a documentary. 
$C: You could make this with any of about five company's affiliates and cover about 100% of the US.

And since almost everyone views their local news to be their last-stand source of ***trustworthy*** journalists...

Well, you get the idea.  Maybe 50 dudes control what an entire country thinks.  Keep that in mind next time all the news outlets agree on something and you think "they can't all make that up."
$C: [Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stations_owned_or_operated_by_Sinclair_Broadcast_Group) is a incomplete list so you can see if your local media has been bought out, too.
$C: Save your Reddit Gold and donate the money to PBS.
$C: this should easily be on the first page of /r/all/top with the amount of upvotes it has but it's nowhere to be seen. what's going on?
$C: Oh my god, this needs a million up votes and a week on the front page. Thank you very much OP, *especially* if you also created the original video!
$C: We should burn everything down and just start humanity over again.

Edit: I guess I should of slapped one of these (/s) bad boys on.
$C: 1984 anyone?
$C: Repeat with me, "Sinclair Broadcast Group is extremely dangerous to our democracy."
$C: Take this fucker down again and we riot
$C: Holy shit OP, I'm normally not a conspiracy nut but you better run a script or two to get rid of your post history to not get doxxed. 
$C: "OBEY" "CONSUME" "CONFORM".... and other "They Live" references.
$C: *This is extremely damaging to our monopoly.*
$C: The question is what are we going to do about it?
$C: When a video receives 227k upboats,1.3 million views after being posted on reddit,and 63 golds, but doesn't go to the front of reddit...You know that the Admins have an agenda. 
$C: Very creepy.
$C: Rochester 13 WHAM! WE DID IT GUYS!!!
$C: This is how democracy dies. With thunderous repetition
$C: This is starting to effect the way i listen to people, even if it’s not news, I’m constantly questioning what is true now 
$C: Holy propaganda Batman!
$C: It’s back from the dead. Reason given?
$C: this is how they keep the old people brainwashed
$C: It's been an ongoing battle by the media to discredit social media with the fake news narrative that has been going on.

Face it, the 2016 election and the hacked emails revealed the systemic corruption by the political insiders and the media to manipulate public opinion. It put tremendous damage on the establishment and the media. The fake news and Russian collusion narrative is the media and the establishment fighting back to regain its control.

Social media has done a net good for politics, by far.

Does social media have its issues? Sure. But the alternative is far worse. Before online social platforms existed, people passively consumed information from a few select sources on television. And it's often tailored to the lowest common denominator. Television treats politics as if it's some reality-show-sports-game, focusing on poll numbers and scandals. The actual issues and policies are pushed to the wayside. If you wanted to do research on your own, you had to go to the library and ask the librarian to dig through cabinets of catalogs to find the information you wanted.

The internet has vastly expanded the political discourse. Yes, that means there is an increase of bad information. But the flip side is also true. People can do research now on unprecedented levels. You could quickly look up facts to confirm it. You could quickly look up a candidate's voting record. The average person could engage in politics instead of just listening to a few pundits on the screen.

The result is that people who engage online have vastly different political views than the ones pushed by the television news outlets. The older generation grew up getting their news from television and they continue to rely on it as their primary news source. The median age of the CNN viewer is 60. Fox and MSNBC is 65. 

And you could see a stark divide in their political opinions compared to those younger than 35. The younger, more engaged generation prefer candidates that speak with substance. It's not surprising when the candidates that are popular on the internet are very different than the ones covered on television. Bernie Sanders had a media blackout yet he is overwhelmingly popular with those younger than 35. 

What's going to happen when the older generation passes away? The establishment will lose their control of public opinion through the corporate media. They will not go without a fight. 
$C: Love how Americans are constantly saying how much propaganda there is in North Korea and Russia but fail to look within their own country.
$C: Second most upvoted post in Reddit (soon to be #1) and it's gone from r/all ?

A nerve was touched.
$C: This feels like a hostage video that a terrorist would release. I thought at first it was all CBS or something. It’s even spookier that it’s all different networks. 
$C: Okay I feel America is officially unqualified to mock Russia’s press anymore
$C: Much of this problem dates back to 1996, when Bill Clinton signed in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. 

Besides killing Saturday Morning cartoons, it also eased almost all restrictions of media ownership. It allows iHeart Media to own the vast majority of radio stations you hear. And Sinclair to own most of the TV you watch. 

It killed the local DJ. And further deregulation last year will kill the local news completely. It’s no longer a requirement for local broadcasting stations to have any kind of studio in the markets they serve. 

So Sinclair can now broadcast to 200 cities, a single message, from a highly controllable talking head in a single room in New York City. 

This has been building for 22 years now. There’s no getting this genie back in the bottle. 
$C: Holy shit. From [this wiki page on the Executive Chairman and son of the original founder:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_D._Smith)

* In a speech to business executives in New York (on December 16, 2016), Jared Kushner said that Donald Trump’s campaign had struck a deal with Sinclair to provide extra access and coverage.

* Sinclair Broadcasting has hired Boris Ephsteyn as their chief political analyst. Mr. Ephsteyn was previously a spokesperson for Donald Trump's campaign. All Sinclair stations are required to air Mr. Ephsteyn's commentary nine times per week. He was born in Moscow, Soviet Union and emigrated to the United States as a child.

$C: If anyone is interested in learning more about media propaganda I can’t recommend Manufacturing Consent by Noam Chomsky enough. There is also a documentary based on the book too if you’d rather watch than read. 
$C: How come this doesn't show up on /r/all ?
By upvotes it is currently #5 all time, doesn't show up at all.
$C: Congratulation OP, you officially have the #1 post of all time on /r/videos.

*This is extremely dengerous to our democracy.*
$C: The fact that this post isn't at the top of reddit (or even just r/videos) right now, and the fact that it hasn't been on top of reddit for the whole day, is pretty clear evidence of reddit actively suppressing this. 
$C: 238k upvotes, posted 19 hours ago. How the fuck is this not on the front page of reddit?
$C: How is this not trending on youtube? almost 2 million views in a day
$C: can we talk about why this isnt on r/all for top of all time at 248k upvotes?
$C: "This is extremely dangerous to our democracy" ×1000 

Blah blah blah talking heads 

Edit: This is very unsettling to say the least. This world is beyond crazy.

$C: thanks telecommunications act of 1996!

$C: Holy shit... this shouldn't matter if you're liberal or conservative, this is freaking scary stuff.
$C: I want to leave a comment on this #1 reddit post:

**This** is *extremely* dangerous to our democracy.
$C: This will be deleted very soon.
$C: I can't even begin to explain how ironic it is that they're talking about biased and fake news when all they're doing is churning out the exact same words as each other, given to them by some higher up script writer. I'm not one to usually get all political but it really goes to show that no matter what news source you use, a lot of it is just gonna be the same bullshit biased propaganda
$C: Reality doesn't give a shit what the positions people have are.  If two people disagree on something, reality doesn't magically fit in between those two people's ideas.  

Extreme example, to illustrate the point:  If one person says it's not ok to shoot a harmless pet, and another person says to shoot that pet ten times, it's not a compromise to shoot it 5 times.  It's not 'left leaning' to shoot it 3 times, and not shooting it at all isn't an extreme counterpoint to shooting it ten times.  A reasonable person will conclude that the first person is 100% correct and that the second person should *never* have a say as to what happens to that pet.

Beware of anyone that is more concerned with 'bias' than actual outcome.  They act like they're playing fair, but they already rigged the game in their favor.
$C: I guess Donald trump was right on one thing. Fake news.
$C: John Oliver did a piece on Sinclair news on The Last Week Tonight. Here's a link: https://youtu.be/GvtNyOzGogc
$C: Half of the women have the same hairstyle too
$C: Uh why the fucking hell was this removed????
$C: [removed]
$C: Dozens?  Isn’t it almost 200?
$C: The irony here is painful. like legitimately painful. I dont like this one bit. This gives me a "they live" vibe
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: [removed]
$C: [removed]
$C: The word democracy sounds so strange now. 
$C: We don't live in a fucking democracy!!!!!!!
$C: This is some Grade-A Orwellian shit.
$C: Are we back in business? Thank you other mods for silencing that dumbass mod that thought this was political. Fuck off! people need to see this. 
$C: Glad to see this post back. It was briefly locked and deleted earlier.
$C: Ummmmm why did this get removed from the frontpage? Are we censoring this right now? Please someone explain how this has 117k upvotes, was on the front page and randomly is gone?

Was up at 10:30pm EST gone by 10:35pm EST. Only found this thread by googling the exact title.

WTF Reddit???
$C: Orwellian. As. Fuck.
$C: What makes this even worse is the content. They are literally projecting about what they are doing in the very segment. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: An anchor discussed how they felt about it to CNN a few weeks ago. 

http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/07/media/sinclair-broadcasting-promos-media-bashing/index.html

I'm sure many are afraid to speak out about it for fear of termination and blacklisting.
$C: It's really concerning how quickly this dissipated from top of r/all
$C: This is fucking art. This should be in a museum. It really highlights one of the most pressing issues of our modern world today.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our hypocrisy
$C: Why isn't this post showing up on r/all/top/ ?

$C: The fact that this isn't on the top of r/All, let alone the frontpage is scary as fuck. I've known about stuff like this for a long time, but it's videos like this that really drives home the agenda of Sinclair
$C: Still no comment from Sinclair. Guess they don’t have to give a fuck when they got a monopoly on this shit
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our monopoly
$C: [removed]
$C: "Sinclair Broadcasting has hired Boris Ephsteyn as their chief political analyst. Mr. Ephsteyn was previously a spokesperson for Donald Trump's campaign. All Sinclair stations are required to air Mr. Ephsteyn's commentary nine times per week. He was born in Moscow, Soviet Union and emigrated to the United States as a child."
$C: The fact that this isn’t a joke is the worst April Fools ever. 
$C: This is the best part about the people complaining about fake news and Russian election tampering, they instantly forget all about the billions of dollars spent by superpacs, the huge billion dollar campaign donors, and obvious media bias.  As if we had something functioning and balanced before the Russians got involved.

Billions of dollars spent, but a handful of negative tweets and everybody loses their mind.
$C: Sinclair is a known, unapologetic right-wing-based organization. 

Prior to Sinclair, local broadcast news was reliable when it came to unbiased, even-handed reporting. Even when some Raycom/LIN stations would insert commentary at the end of the broadcast from the station manager, they'd CLEARLY label it, run a disclaimer as a lead in LABELING it as editorial comment from the station manager.

One of the most refreshing thing prior to Sinclair was the "hit 'em when they're down" approach that the 3+ local broadcast news outlets would take when someone flubbed. **Explanation**: Because local TV news is dependent on ratings, viewers, and "loyalty", they would attack their own in a MINUTE if they caught one outlet airing a biased story, a factually inaccurate story, or one that was just hyped bullshit. Say the ABC station does a "BREAKING NEWS" story on a politician, trying to "GOTCHA" them into corner. They blast him/her with allegations, and leverage the surprise element to cast the public figure in a negative light. 

The PR folks (or the public figure themselves) will reach out to the other in-market stations, invited them to a Q&A, no restrictions, and do so in a place where they can bar the offending ABC station from attending. (I've seen it where the person would go to each of the other stations' studios one-by-one and refuse an invite from the offending station.) Each reliable station gets a full, involved interview that clearly destroys the reputation of the ABC station. They lose viewers, and sponsors/advertisers, and they lose any credibility in the market as a result. This is why nearly all FOX local stations (even Owned and Operated ones) have been superior to the cable affiliate FNC - credibility.

What Sinclair is doing is going to create one of two scenarios:

* They'll make Fox News Channel look like NPR/John Oliver with this nonsense. Fox News Channel is blasted for favoring the conservative ideology - Sinclair's approach is more of a "you're cute. Hold my fries Fox, you liberal hippie." Doing this will destroy the long-held credibility of local TV news and create an even more destructive divide among Americans where "fake news" is involved. 

* They'll implode and self-destruct. Because of the delicate loyalty of local TV news markets, the other non-Sinclair stations will use ethical, journalistic methods to undermine the Sinclair stations indirectly and also work with people in the market to freeze out the Sinclair station at high-profile news events. Maybe the PR folks will forget to include the Sinclair station on the press release. Maybe they'll be the last outlet called on at press conferences or Police briefings. **This is the most optimistic, best-case scenario.** If this works, Sinclair will find themselves hemorrhaging money and unable to maintain the ratings needed to justify the operations. 

KNOW who your local Sinclair stations are and do everything in your legal power to disrupt their operations. Don't accept interview requests, don't buy advertising, don't watch programming on that station (all national content is available via HULU/CBS Access,) don't call in news tips to them, don't invite their weather guy to your schools - freeze them out of your market and let them know early and often that you will not support their biased, destructive, and unwanted broadcast operations in your town/city/market.

Write them letters. Send emails. Call their manager. Call the news tipline. Don't be juvenile - don't give them any means to discredit you - state that you're a resident in the market and that you find their operations to be devoid of ethics and credibility, and that you will not be a viewer of their station at any time as longs as they're owned/operated by Sinclair. 

**This is not hyperbole. This is not hype. This is not fake news. What Sinclair is doing is INCREDIBLY destructive and divisive to journalism and local news.** 

(Source: I'm a former local news journalist)
$C: There exists two different issues here: the consolidation of media power, and the truth of the message they're pushing in this clip.

To the former, yes this is an issue and has been so for a long time.

To the latter, the message they're broadcasting here is not wrong. 
$C: This is how many of our parents/grandparents get their news folks, keep that in mind
$C: Why do I feel this belongs in r/megalophobia
$C: Think any of these "anchors" will quit after they see this?
$C: Holy fuck.

The new Black Mirror trailer looks sick!
$C: Holy Shit. This is a wake up call.
$C: 1984 has stopped being just a book and is turning into our reality. 
$C: “This is extremely dangerous to our democracy” stopped making sense to me and now it sounds and looks weird....
$C: Wow this is actually scary 
$C: Conan O'Brien has a whole series of these on his YouTube channel.
$C: Okay. This is real. This is the reality we are living in. Alright. 
$C: >This is *extremely* dangerous to our democracy.

You can say that again.
$C: Everyone and their mothers need to upvote this video
$C: Fuck these people. I hope they see themselves in this and realize this is total garbage. 

My parents are retired and we've had the Sinclair conversation, identified what channel it is in their community and they've agreed to find news at other sources. I'm totally cool with having different view points, but I refuse to lose them to this bullshit or Fox News.

Edit: grammar 
$C: This is like some dystopian novel played out right in front of us. Don’t look behind the curtains kids. 
$C: Whoever controls the most sources of fact, wins. This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. No tinfoil hats required.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our shareholders
$C: I’m fucking scared.  



Should I be fucking scared?
$C: This could literally be the opening sequence of a dystopian movie.
$C: AAAANNNDDD this has been wiped from the front page. 
$C: You know I thought “fake news” was a joke. Then I saw this. Holy shit this is fucked up. 
$C: Welp. The amount of gold given in this post has funded Reddit’s daily goal for the next month. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: I've seen some shit over the years while browsing Reddit. This might be the most disturbing. 
$C: Remember that none of the newsroom staff, anchors, or the production crew has any choice in broadcasting this. My station is about to be bought by Sinclair, and we have been told there are "Must Run" stories with scripts we can't change. Some of the edgier stations run this drivel at like 2 am. 
$C: This is starting to feel like a really bad acid trip, man..
$C: Dont care.  Distracted by my  landscapers paperwork and the porn stars being sexually harrassed 
$C: Ah, good ol' Sinclair.
$C: I’m here to say hi to future historians 
$C: Huh I kinda like the "Disturbing content" tag. Does that hide the post for, say, logged-out users?
$C: Did anyone else feel like they were watching a black mirror episode?
$C: "Sinclair Media is extremely dangerous to our democracy"
$C: This did not stay on the front page like it was suppose to. Posts with 6x less the votes are still up and they are older than this post. 
$C: Boris Alexandrovich Epshteyn is a **Russian-born** American **Republican political strategist**, investment banker, and attorney. He is currently the **Chief Political Analyst at Sinclair Broadcast Group**. He was a senior advisor to **Donald Trump's 2016 campaign** for President of the United States
$C: This is just *not* showing up on the front-page.

What's up with Reddit?
$C: I love how concerned they all look. They've all got such emotion on their faces when they read this scripted dribble trying to make the viewers believe that they're honest, concerned citizens, just like us at home. 

This isn't the first time someone has made a video like this so I'm amazed that they didn't even bother to adjust the script slightly so they weren't all saying exactly the same thing. 

They're that confident that everyone watching is a sheep and will suck up their "pillar of the community" bullshit persona. 
$C: #1 post all time on r/videos. We did it Reddit but accomplished absolutely nothing.
$C: GG Reddit. Blocking this from #1 on /r/All
$C: Aaaand youtube's hidden it from trending in the united states but its #1 in other countries? Yeah I gotta leave 
$C: Reporter: "This is extremely dangerous to our monopoly"

Director: "Dammit! Cut! It's democracy, Bill! Again from the top."
$C: So /u/spez why is this not on all/top?
$C: [We want your soul](https://youtu.be/_WTBkj8gFfI)


$C: Test
$C: This is gone from my front page now
$C: This makes me sick.  Physically fucking sick.
$C: All stupid fucking liberals

Just like 98 percent of reddit.

Fuck liberals 
$C: How come when you sort by top of all time this post doesnt appear?
$C: Good thing I cut the cord!
$C: I now have ZERO RESPECT for news casters. How in the hell can they look at themselves in the mirror, every single morning??? Disgusting!!
$C: This post needs more traction to direct them to that youtube vid. I hope the video gets to trending.
$C: lol stolen video tag :P hhahahshahaha mods are bought
$C: I appreciate the BBC more now.
$C: [removed]
$C: hard to swallow pill for ya here reddit but the outlets that are constantly worried about fake news and constantly report on it are usually the ones that do it!
$C: [deleted]
$C: It sounds like they're implying "extremely dangerous" as a good thing, like dark foreshadowing. 
$C: Has anyone else noticed that this video still isn't trending on YouTube in the US even tho it has almost 2 million views in 1 day? Yet, it's the #1 trending video in the UK and in Canada, and is trending in every other big western country I've checked...
$C: Interestingly, people over at T_D are reacting exactly the way we are over here, right down to the "These pretzels are making me thirsty" bit. They also seem to think this is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 

Tonight, a divided Reddit is united in horror.
$C: I fear that the only takeaway Reddit will have from this video is that since Sinclair is a conservative media group, it is only the "right" that pushes narratives. 

If you cannot see the parallels between this video and the feed back loop of your own political bubbles, then its message was lost on you. Controlling what you think is very much a bipartisan effort.
$C: [deleted]
$C: 1. Buy news media.
2. Force them to report with a conservative bias.
3. Force them to report that news media is a liberal conspiracy. 
4. Force them to convince viewers that only they report the truth.
5. Force them to report that government is a liberal conspiracy.
6. Dismantle government protections.
7. Buy the government.

$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: let me guess...Sinclair ? 
$C: this is extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: This is scary. The same corporations tell us what to eat, what to buy, and what to be fearful of. Capitalistic Propaganda. 
$C: This is honestly terrifying. This is stuff you see in other countries. This is propaganda. I don’t understand people who refuse to see the light. This is not right.
$C: I’m no expert, but I get the feeling this may be extremely dangerous for our democracy.

$C: This IS extremely dangerous to our democracy 
$C: My god.... hivemind.
$C: Modern journalism is a cancer on society.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: This is why we need our media ownership laws back.  They never should have been overturned. 
$C: This is why I do not have a cable subscription.
$C: Hahaha the suited wankers strike again. 
$C: They started airing this on my local ABC news (Seattle area is overwhelmingly liberal) and now every piece that looks bad for Republicans is followed by a tweet or Facebook post by some redneck explaining the virtues of conservativism.  It's so weird.
$C: “We are legion”
$C: Chilling 
$C: Have to give them props for so efficiently brain-washing the sheeple of Conservative america.
$C: "This is extremely dangerous to our monopoly"
$C: "This is extremely dangerous to our democracy". That's the most surreal shit I've ever seen before. 
$C: This entire speech is dangerous to your democracy
$C: My local news was rated number 1, until SinclaiR bought them in 2012. The two main anchors towards the evening have changed their tones. News stories are biased, and I'm seeing more propaganda. Their FB is atrocious, sensationalizing headlines to get people riled up, click bait titles, and one siding articles.
$C: Why do i feel like the united states of America is resorting to a state similar to the late 1800's when companies could monopolize without penalties and the people were treated like labor cattle.
$C: This isn't the only time something like this has happened. Sinclair Broadcast Group, who owns these stations and mandated this be read, has also produced must-run stories for their stations in the past, typically with a heavy conservative bias.

For example, they recently mandated stations run a piece promoting the concept that there's a "deep state" which secretly controls the country. This is a conspiracy theory popular among conservatives, (specifically Trump supporters) and the piece even featured an interview with former Trump deputy assistant, Sebastian Gorka. 

You can find the piece here: http://komonews.com/news/nation-world/poll-finds-majority-of-americans-concerned-about-deep-state

If that's not creepy enough on its own, the story was produced by Kristine Frazao, best known as a former correspondent for RT, a news network funded by the Russian government. 
$C: On one hand - this is awesome and disturbing.

On the other hand... what is the collective viewership of these stations? Terrestrial TV is a wasteland just like over-the-air radio today.
$C: This is... Incredible.
$C: This is poorly written novel levels of dystopian future shit.
$C: Another conspiracy in light
$C: Holy shit
$C: And this is what propaganda looks like in a democracy.
$C: FREEDOM
$C: I wonder about the future of this country.  The far right scares me as does any fundalmentalist control in any country.
$C: So this was hidden from the front page, locked, unlocked, but still hidden from the front page
$C: Obey. Consume.
$C: Wait is this an April Fools joke?
$C: unlocked????   what????
$C: Couldn't even finish the video. It worries me to the point that it's eerie. Creeps me out!
$C: And the post is back.  Crazy to see it was removed for being "political"
$C: Holy crap. Either side you're on that was powerful.
$C: This is actually scary. 
$C: What I'm still left wondering, is this dangerous to our democracy?
$C: Holy shit. This looks like something that happens in movies with authoritarian governments.
$C: whelp. i hated that. 
$C: Terrifying. Absolutely terrifying. 
$C: Sinclair Broadcasting Group is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Orwell would be proud.
$C: Sad to see my local channel on here. 
$C: Do you think all the news casters were aware that they were reading the same script as others? 
$C: this is some dystopian future shit
$C: It turns out the people warning us about fake news are also fake news
$C: Absolutely brilliant!  You've deconstructed the original editing to broadcast the creepy truth.
$C: This is more gold than I've ever seen in the same place! And well deserved!
$C: Reminds me of the John Oliver piece on journalism! 
$C: “The whole educational and professional training system is a very elaborate filter, which just weeds out people who are too independent, and who think for themselves, and who don't know how to be submissive, and so on -- because they're dysfunctional to the institutions.”

-	Noam Chomsky
$C: The god damned fucking nerve of this organization calling out the "sharing of biased and false news" when that's exactly what this whole party has guilty of this whole time. 

KGB: accuse your enemies of that which you are guilty.

These people are a fucking cancer to this country. 
$C: when the owners of capital have in their best interests to support a political party the media can be just as propagandistic as an authoritarian regime. 
$C: the fucking dumb look of fake genuine concern on their faces is disgusting. 
$C: Is there a verified easy to access list of which stations sinclair owns?
$C: Fucking muppets. I can't even fathom the words to express my disappointment. I just don't know what to say anymore. Help.
$C: Just watched this disappear strangely suddenly from the front page...
$C: This will be spun as an April fools joke
$C: Support your local PBS station.  Pay attention to local productions and the amount of content that is produced locally.  There are people who want your local stations to go away.  I'm talking about people inside PBS.   
$C: It’s kind of Erie when you realize the sadistic shit that is flushed into our minds in order to control us. 
$C: Yet most muppets still will believe mainstream media. 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: I feel like this is extremely dangerous to our democracy 
$C: I was JUST watching CBS news covering Treasure Valley Idaho yesterday and heard this speech at the end of their segment. It felt so fishy that I knew it had to be some scripted junk written by their corporate bosses but this is just insane. 
$C: This video is extremely well edited. I’ve seen similar videos a few times the past few years; but this looks like it came straight out of an episode of *Black Mirror*. Perfect 5/7
$C: my dick is extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: They own 40% not dozens of all stations in the US

$C: 37 gold! I have never seen a post with this much gold. Is there a post with more???
$C: Well, time to go live in the woods for the rest of my life. 

Fuck this.
$C: I sincerely hope whoever removed and/or locked this post is no longer a mod of this sub. Said person just proved they cannot be trusted with power -- even the minimal internet kind.
$C: canadian here, wtf

$C: We only have a handful of big telecom companies in Canada, but this is ridiculous. 
$C: This creeped me right the fuck out.
$C: Here in San antonio., Sinclair own the fox, nbc and cw stations. It's a fucking Monopoly.
$C: What was odd while watching this was hearing and seeing my local anchors, and it made my heart drop...
$C: No, THIS, is extremely dangerous to our democracy 
$C: 7 hours old and not at the top of All? 

What

The

Fuck


$C: Oh mods. Everything has political implications. This is a video about a media company. Just because said media company admits to have a particular political bias, doesn't make any video about them political. Think about that next time you try removing an extremely popular post.
$C: The battle isn’t between the government and private enterprises as much as it is between power being in the hands of many or the few. Once the power is in the hands of the view that power will be abused by corporate and government interests working together for their own well being. This capitalist vs socialist debate is a false paradigm created to keep us preoccupied with the wrong questions. Monopolies take away the same freedoms and privacies that we suspect and fear the government is taking, they’re just better at gaining our cooperation. 
$C: This video is a scary reminder that what you see is what another person *wants* you to see. Think for yourself.

$C: [A little background into it.](https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/how-americas-largest-local-tv-owner-turned-its-news-anc-1824233490)
$C: War is Peace.

Freedom is Slavery.

Ignorance is Strength.

$C: That felt like a scene from Mr. Robot.
$C: People need to upvote the YouTube video as well so it makes it on to trending on YouTube. Those who don't use Reddit need to see this too.
$C: [This is extremely dangerous to our democracy](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/275466402629025792/429874088387805195/video.mov) 
$C: Ah and I see the station I work for. 
$C: Fam don’t watch this high
$C: Hey Reddit, ELI5 - how do we fix this threat to our democracy? 
$C: Don't watch TV.  Period.
$C: Am I the only on that thinks things like this make getting rid of the 2nd amendment a bad idea?
$C: Can this be April's meme?

This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: this (r/videos) no longer shows in either the hot home flow, the top home flow, the top of all, or anywhere on the front page. currently r/conspiracy and r/television have running posts still there at 23.15 pst. reddit is officially a 'sanctioned' news aggregator that i would not be surprised to see release a statement that includes 

this is extremely dangerous to our democracy.

and yes,  yes it is.
$C: #1 on r/videos
have my gold sir
$C: This is fucked up..... WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU YANKS DOING!!! 
$C: Holy shit is this the most upvoted post on Reddit?
$C: [And this is what happens when news stations read whatever a press release tells them to. ](https://youtu.be/TM8L7bdwVaA)
$C: Folks. Just turn the news off. Read a book or write one. 
$C: People in this thread want to act like frontpage Reddit is organic and not like this video. Glad this is getting exposure tho
$C: This shit is scary as fuck, and we all ***SHOULD*** be scared, because this isn't right in the slightest. We need to do something, as a people, to stand up to this kind of shit. The thing is, I don't even know what we can do anymore, since no matter who you vote for, the policies always seem to be the same in the end: the status quo. But...something's gotta give.
$C: This probably isn’t the best thing to watch when you’ve just woke up.... feel like I’m in 1984 or something.
$C: I remember John Oliver posted a detailed piece on this last year. As usual, he was way ahead in time than rest of us.
$C: That is actually scary. NO wonder America is a fucked and broken nation.
$C: Can we tweet this video to each of the stations featured in this video?
$C: In before this completely disappears by 11am PST and is never spoken of again.

I see things as damning as this once once in a while but what do you actually do?
$C: Hey guys, don't listen to other news sources... listen to us.. 
$C: Glad I don't watch the news. That is the creepiest shit I have seen in a while.

$C: Yo I dont like cnn either but all the people here saying cnn is just as bad as fox are either fucking delusional or baiting
$C: I really hope "This is extremely dangerous to our democracy" becomes a meme
$C: **The mainstream media is fake news.**
$C: You're being programmed people. Reconditioned to the false song of globalism.

$C: I feel like they're trying to tell me something...
$C: I remember reading some time ago on /r/KotakuInAction how the then-recent concept of "fake news" exhibited all signs of a coordinated narrative to suppress alternative viewpoints. Boy, were they right!

[Found the thread, here it is](/r/KotakuInAction/comments/5dlo9j/fake_news_the_mainstream_medias_newest/)

$C: Do you really think liberal news isn’t pushing their own agenda/propaganda as well as conservative media? You could do this with every single liberal OR conservative “live” news station in the country and it would show the same thing; every single one breaks the same exact news, using the exact same full sentences to describe what’s going on today in “real time”, and then they spin the story to work for one side, or the other - it’s blatant pre-rehearsed propaganda and it ALWAYS supports their ideology, laws, and politicians. What else can you expect when just about 8 companies in the US basically own everything?

Here’s an example containing proof that *both sides of the political spectrum* work together to manipulate the public (I see Fox, NBC, ABC, CBS, and CNN all using the same exact terminology in this video) - https://youtu.be/eZVv2AOCnaA

Here is another example showing *BOTH SIDES* using the same news report over and over again -
https://youtu.be/NNV3_bS_0ts

This is a great documentary going all the way back to Nixon days to show when the government decided to ramp up propaganda on its own people, all the way to today where you can see how it’s still being used on us now (on both sides of the agenda, from all news networks) -
https://youtu.be/aRBc2VhYYnY
$C: At 20 seconds, it's like the Borg coming to assimilate you
$C: It was Russia 
$C: One of the best parts of this video is that the United States isn't even a democracy. 
$C: Wow...  not on the front page with this many upvotes.  Reddit is sketchy as fuck.
$C: this just got removed from front page
$C: Who wants some additional videos?

$C: News stations no longer provide just information, they now peddle influence.  

Same thing happens on both sides, different message, same 💩.  
$C: # THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO OUR DEMOCRACY
$C: This video is just one example of how the world works at large... control from above. In this example, no single newscaster felt like they were part of a conspiracy(for lack of a better word), yet they all played their part, most likely oblivious to any big-picture agenda.

This is also why "all doctors agree", and how scientific consensus is born. 

Yet many people still can't believe that big conspiracies could possibly exist.

$C: oh snap, this is now the top post of all time across Reddit
$C: Democracy is overrated, can we please get some enlightened despotism in here?

$C: This should be the 2nd most highest up voted post in r/all why it isn't showing
$C: "This is extremely damaging to our hypocracy."
$C: If u try to sort top posts in front page or this subreddit, it doesnt show this thread. 
$C: Its like state sanctioned media but run by a corporation. 

Propaganda fueled by big business instead of a government. Scary, but pretty interesting too.
$C: Why the fuck did it take me 1 fucking month to see this? Putrid, robotic assholes with no sense of marality. They are just collecting a paycheck like 99 percent of America. The bad part is, these fuckers have gotten away with it and they'll continue to influence weak minded people.

$C: Herd the sheep 
$C: George Orwell is going to have a field day if he is alive today.
$C: Unpopular opinion, there is nothing wrong with the owner(s) of the media group wanting to state, on all of their owned local stations, that fake news is dangerous to our democracy.  In no way is that propaganda, what message did they send, 'do your own research'?  Damn, dangerous.  The real propaganda here is the video, suggesting somehow the media at large is in itself fake news and that you should seek out alternative news sources, you guys got played hard, I bet the KGB made this video.
$C: ###This is extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our Democracy.
$C: Diversity and inclusion... where everyone looks different but they all think the same.
$C: But a bunch of dumbasses keep beliving whatever the news tells them.. So it must be true
$C: I was actually in Belarus (Russia's little brother) when I realized our whole media sphere was controlled. Just to see real news on their TV compared to NBC, BBC, Fox, etc.... and it was obvious who was lying.

That was back when Ukraine was having their "revolution", which was actually a US-backed coup covered up by western media. People are dying due to this media deception. I don't know if you all are ready to hear this, but this is how they covered up 9/11. JFK. Wars. Whew..

I'm constantly asking my Russian friend for "real" information. Our science, our education, our medical system.. it's all fucked.
$C: Twitter is a soap box for the lowest common human denominator. There is very much so an agenda pushed on that site constantly. This site will disagree because their agenda is in line with twitters, but people should be weary of the information that is put on a pedestal there. Social media has warped news and “journalism” into something almost unrecognizable. Be smart. Use Reuters or AP. 
$C: John Oliver did a bit on Last Week Tonight about the Sinclair group and these kinds of scripts if you're interested. [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvtNyOzGogc)
$C: I can't help but look at /r/The_Donald when anything like this pops up. I went over there, and still found multiple users claiming fake news is a leftist thing, and that the right is somehow immune to this.

Look. Fucking look. The 1% LOVES stupid people. The dumber people are, the easier it is for the rich to take what they want. The 1% controls all of the media you consume on a regular basis. ABC, Fox, and NBC are all owned by the same company and spread the same fake or sensationalized stories across all of their properties.

If you want actual news, look at AP, BBC, ~~Google*~~, or WSJ. Stop consuming news from CNN, WaPo, NYT, ABC, Fox, or NBC. It's only contributing to the downfall of America.

**Disclaimer: This is obviously an exaggerated post, but it has a backbone of truth. The 1% aren't going to wake up tomorrow and take over America, but it's happening slowly, and we can stop it. Get out and vote. Please. For the love of god, vote. Do your research. Look up your state candidates, find out their stances on issues, and vote for them. I don't give a shit if the guy you vote for is Democrat, Republican, Libertarian, or a fucking guy with a boot on his head, as long as the people that read this comment go out and VOTE.**

Sinclair pushes ultra far right fake news to benefit trump. They need to be stopped. We need to go after their advertisers.
$C: So can we start boycotting the stations they own? Can we Lauren Ingraham our local stations and call advertisers?
$C: John Oliver did a great story on Sinclair and local sindications. Check it out.
$C: What some of the anchors in the video think about this promo:

["At my station, everyone was uncomfortable doing it," a local anchor said. The person insisted on anonymity because they believed they would be fired for speaking out.

$C: I love how conservative bullshit always starts out like “im not taking sides the liberals and the conservatives both have their own agendas but what you need to understand is that we are under attack by the browns, the poor,  knowledge, people trying to take our guns, etc. and something must be done to stop them!” Shits so easy to spot and is regurgitated by everyone who is a mouthpiece of that garbage.
$C: Man everythings so fucked. I don't even know what to do. Like whats the fucking point when shitshows on a scale of this seem to come week after week.

Just... Fuck...
$C: Why is fox the only one reddit seems to hate? This exact thing is going on in ALL the news stations.
$C: It’s worth noting that Sinclair broadcasting is a conservative leaning company. That makes this whole fake news thing pretty ironic. 
$C: 200k upvotes, x55 reddit gold and It was barely on the front page for an hour... nah nothing suspicious about that at all. Reddit mods would never censor anything.../s
$C: Test

$C: We may be f*cked. Unpopular opinion, I know. But how would we ever turn this around?

$C: ya Sinclair recently bought one of my local news stations and it's reporting has seriously gone down hill since.  It is almost all just thinly veiled conservative propaganda now.  
$C: This is why I have mostly switched to PBS, NPR and the BBC for most of my news. 
$C: This is simply capitalism without regulation..


$C: Because I couldn't find a good description of the issue at hand in the comments, from /r/conspiracy:
>This was posted in a different thread and helps explain a bit of what's going on.
Last April, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai, led the charge for his agency to approve rules allowing television broadcasters to greatly increase the number of stations they own. A few weeks later, Sinclair Broadcasting announced a blockbuster $3.9 billion deal to buy Tribune Media — a deal those new rules made possible.
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/technology/fcc-sinclair-ajit-pai.html
The United States' largest owner of television stations, Sinclair Broadcast Group, mandated that its outlets run a segment on the so-called deep state that was produced by a former reporter for the Russian propaganda outlet RT, according to a new report.
http://www.newsweek.com/sinclair-broadcast-group-must-run-deep-state-rt-russia-today-867029
As scripted, the promos decry "fake stories" from national news outlets -- echoing President Trump's inflammatory rhetoric about "fake news."

Props to u/Trigger_Me_Harder
$C: And reddit wonders why trump won.
$C: 235k upvotes, 63 golds. We're in for a record guys??
$C: Now you know what your grandparents are watching. For everyone else, when was the last time you watched the local news on purpose?

It's creepy, but they’re targeting a dying and increasingly irrelevant demographic.
$C: Oh for fucks sake, it's a tide ad isn't it.
$C: Are we allowed to post this on T_D ? 

Edit: Okay it’s already there.

TL;DR:


-	It’s okay to script messages when they aren’t “News”
-	Obama made this legal
-	This can be done with left wing media [No source as of this edit]
-	Sinclair is being painted as right wing for recently acquiring a few.
-	You heard it on InfoWars first
-	Where they live the Sinclair media is left leaning [No source as of this edit]
-	All the threads about it are locked so they can’t defend it and they are being silenced by Reddit while they let us have our fun
$C: Whelp. Whoever posted this is now on the fbi’s most wanted list. 
$C: Its like a shitty cover of an already shitty song. 
$C: How do they all speak at the same speed?
$C: This extremely creepy
$C: Wow that is very disturbing
$C: This feels like the intro to an Orwellian style movie.
$C: So which news is the real news?
$C: They’re right. That IS extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: This is the shit some novelist would have thought up years ago, thinking it would only stay fictional.
$C: That was very enlightening thank you sir !
$C: And yup there’s my hometown news station I grew up with. Frank Coletta what have you done. 
$C: We are screwed.
$C: Wow. This expresses how many people do not think in their jobs anymore and just follow scripts given to them. And in that kind of world, the supine and power-hungry and not the cream rise to the top!
$C: As seen on social media. 
$C: Holy Shit.
$C: Propaganda is Power.

$C: I feel like "1984" and Black Mirror had a baby.
$C: I'm utterly terrified. 
$C: Scary as hell
$C: Really pathetic. I have one of these in my market. Just sad.
$C: shame one every host on those shows. 
$C: Anyone thinking about the movie ‘They Live’ while watching this? 
$C: "Kill All Others"
$C: They are like the borg
$C: Sinclair is basically Fox News, but they own a ridiculous amount of local over the air stations.  The FCC is starting to relax ownership rules to the point that companies like Gray or Sinclair can own every television station in a certain market and completely shape the local news narrative.  It's fucking scary. 
$C: ALL YOUR DEMOCRACY ARE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO US
$C: This is like someone screaming help while beating the shit out of you.
$C: Told my mom about this. Her response was who cares? They're just trying to sell their news, it's not different than a Coke showing the same ad on multiple networks...

I tried to show how the message is contradictory, and selling a product is different from selling news, but idk how else to respond... 
$C: Welcome my friend

To the machine
$C: "can I copy your homework?"


"yeah but change it up a little so it doesn't look obvious you 
copied"


"ok"
$C: The worst part of it all is that there's nothing someone like myself can do. Sinclair seems to have the FCC in their fucking pocket now, and they're such a giant that once they buy a network, they're not going to let it go. We could try to inform their demographic, but if they can fall for this, then we're boned. 

Also, can you imagine being a newscaster and having to read this out like a POW? Shit must be degrading.
$C: The bubble headed bleached blonde comes on @ 5
$C: This thing where they go on a weird hypocritical offensive against other news organizations and use this notion that the very thing they are doing is what is wrong with everyone but themselves... It seems incredibly reminiscent of Trump. Is this a conservative push in Trump's favor? If so, who is at the top pulling the levers? The Kochs?
$C: The word "democracy" didn't even sound like English after I finished watching this video, it just sounded like gibberish. 
$C: I wonder what thier definition of democracy is 
$C: When you copy your friends homework but try not to make it obvious 
$C: Fuck that puto Ryan Wolf, he was never a journalist to begin with 
$C: I can't believe that actually made the hairs on the back of my head stand on end.
$C: This scares the shit out of me. Needs to be exhibit one at a congressional hearing...next January. 
$C: Lol, they are reposting each other without checking the facts
$C: We watch Europe news for actual news about the U.S. 0 opinions or agendas just facts so we can draw our own conclusions.
$C: Ahhh, good ol America. The illusion of democracy is unlike anywhere on the planet. 
$C: This is disgusting.
$C: Cable is disgusting 
$C: Why is this not on the front page anymore?
$C: that's some scary shit right there
$C: Fox CNN Washington post - don't be listening to the 'talking heads'. Even this video has its own slant. 
$C: [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stations_owned_or_operated_by_Sinclair_Broadcast_Group) is a list stations that sinclair broadcasting group owns.

$C: Anyone got Mr Robot vibes when all that audio was synced up?
$C: Crazy that people still watch local news broadcasts. Though it's crazier that people still have cable subscriptions that allow them to watch local news stations.
$C: and you still think you're getting the news... NOTHING comes your way without someone eyeing to persuade you or make a buck. Even the guy who posts the cardboard sign over the freeway wants a hand in your pocket. Imagine the aims of the people who own the means of information production.
$C: Show this to everyone you know.
$C: This is actually pretty horrifying... 1984 is becoming a reality...😳😳
$C: Time to quote Goebbels:
"When you tell a lie, and repeat it often enough, people will end up believing it"
$C: They are are all tools used to control the masses. 
$C: Don't worry guys! The media totally isn't corrupt and doesn't spin the news to be propaganda. Nothing to see here, move along 
$C: Who watches tv anymore?
$C: We are fucked.
$C: So this is how democracy dies...
$C: godddddamn

$C: Imagine being one of the daily users and watching this! Hopefully there were a couple epiphanies while watching this 
$C: So fucking creepy, and disturbing!
$C: Now I can't hear the word "democracy" as a normal word. It sounds alien.

This is creepy as hell.
$C: [deleted]
$C: This is extrem.... nope, not going to be that guy......ely dangerous to our democracy. Damnit.
$C: For now on anytime I need to describe how much I dislike something I'm going to describe it as "extremely dangerous to our democracy."
$C: Why does this fucking terrify me so much
$C: Holy shit it’s like a ducking propaganda machine 
$C: Aren’t they all FOX affiliates?  This is like being shocked that multiple Republicans (or Democrats for that matter) towing the same line. 

If they’re all FOX affiliates this isn’t Orwellian or disturbing.  It’s what I’d expect to see.

Edit:  No. No. No.  They are CBS/FOX/ABC/NBC repeating the same words. I was wrong. This is bad.
$C: What sorry sacks of shits. 
$C: It's right out of a black mirror episode!

So now what? Do you share this on social media? Demand advertisers remove themselves? What?
$C: The end kind of reminded me of the bit in seinfeld where they stress different syllables of the same sentance. Its funny seeing how each newscaster tries to put their own little flair on it

"this is EXTREMELY dangerous to our democracy"

"THIS is extremely dangerous to our democracy"

"this IS extremely dangerous to OUR democracy"

...
$C: I would be even more concerned if it were not for the fact that tons of people are cutting the cord and no one's watching this crap anymore. 
$C: Thanks Sinclair broadcasting 🖕🏻

$C: This makes me sick
$C: [Dangerous to our democracy](https://i.imgur.com/Sm0F84z.jpg)
$C: There is a term in German for that.
$C: Stop watching the news. It is poison and we all know it.
$C: This is what happens when one *bad* company owns dozens of local news stations
$C: You are being controlled 
$C: This video is giving me anxiety. I was expecting something more [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM8L7bdwVaA) This seems like something out of a dystopian sci-fi movie.
$C: Well I won’t be watching Local 12 news (Cincinnati) anymore...
$C: Just chilling,  simply chilling 
$C: [Have a look at this from Last week Tonight on Sinclair Media Group...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvtNyOzGogc)

$C: A minute and 38 seconds later, I have completely lost the meaning of the word *democracy* – for more than one reason, I should say.
$C: The truly dangerous thing is the ignorant belief that we actually live in a democracy.. 
$C: That creeped me out so much it gave me the chills. 
$C: Freedom....take a big whiff
$C: Projection! This is what Putin did to the media In russia.
$C: Sinclair...owner of the other "TBS" - the Trump Broadcasting System.
$C: we are the borg

resistance is futile

this is extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: Just as I suspected. Not a thought in their heads.
$C: The irony is so thick you could shoot it on 5th Avenue and nobody would do anything about it. 
$C: I fucking hope every one of those journalists die inside from having 0 integrity and being outed for it. I hope they go to work everyday realising how absolutely worthless they are to the overall content they produce... How they are, at absolute best, prostitutes doing anything for a dime.

Journalism needs have be a self regulating profession, not something you can practise when you're this much of a hack.
$C: No, what's really extremely dangerous to our democracy is one company owning all these news stations!!!!!  

I don't believe half the shit I see on these news channels anyway!
$C: There a direct YouTube link to this, please?
$C: This is what regulatory capture looks like. Ajit Pai was a paid lobbyist for the same groups that he is now rolling back regulations for as chairman of the FCC.
$C: Is this extremely dangerous to our democracy? 
$C: Damnit. That is amazing. 
$C: Is this extremely dangerous to our democracy?
$C: HOLY FUCKING SHIT... They are literally robots except they probably didn't even know this is happening.
$C: Holy crap this was amazing and terrifying!
$C: Such yuck. 
$C: Oh joy.  My local station is included.  Do I win a prize, or...?
$C: Do we know if any of the on-site staff refused to take part?
$C: that lat line on repeat "this is extremely dangerous to our democracy" is right. THIS  is extremely dangerous and unsettling
$C: A hive mind is extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: I am the senate.
$C: I’m pretty confused, is this dangerous to our democracy? 
$C: This is why Rush Limbaugh called them newsreaders.  Hate the dude all ya want, but he was 100% on point with that statement

Lower your shields and surrender your ships. 

Your biological and technological distinctiveness will be added to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. 

Resistance is futile. 
$C: I understand that people see this as controlling the news, but what they were stating was a statement put out by their parent company. It would be the same as say the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, or any other paper putting out a statement in their print. The difference is that this is a company that doesn't print papers but rather uses TV as their medium. Companies do this all the time. They were not reporting on a story, they were putting out a company statement. Just like when Reddit wants to put out a statement, they put on their front page. The internet is their medium and they are using it to send out a message. And the content of their message is just the same as any other company would put out. Their commodity is news and information. They want their consumers to value their news and information over that of social media. Just like when Coke says they are better than Pepsi.

Is it right to do? That's debateable. Is it their right to do it? Yes.

Everyone wants the news to be this wholesome source of truth with unbiased slants, to be your 2nd grade teacher where everything they said was absolute. Well guess what, news is a money making commodity. That's the reason why Trump is always headlining it, why we get fascinated with celebrities who go off the rails... It sells papers, and viewership. More viewers, more lucrative ads you can run. The more ads you can run, the more profitable the company. 

Sorry if this was now an eye opener for you, but it's been like this for a long time... Before social media, before the internet, before TV, and before radio.
$C: Y’all FUND INDEPENDENT NEWS. Good news isn’t sustainable with the free market, just like health care. Go sub to a paper or donate to a place that cares about real information and not their shareholders. Jacobin, Intercept, etc
$C: Duh

$C: I got chills watching this.

“...and now announcing the commencement of the annual Purge.”
$C: This is some One World Order stuff right here. 
$C: HOLY CRAP this blew my mind.

$C: Here's American Gladiators, watch this, shut up.



$C: Sooner or later I'm going to be stuck with my conservative relatives over the holidays and they're going to say something that leads me to bringing this up. They're going to say the 'lurbles' do the same thing. Well, do the liberals do the same thing? Is there a liberal version of Sinclair buying up local stations and forcing these people to read their Orwellian scrips on TV? 
$C: Sinclair network.
$C: It's eerie how this one company owns local news stations of all these seemingly different parent channels. 

Fox. NBC. ABC. CBS. 
$C: Yep, I knew they had to follow a set of topics....but I didn't know they followed the same script. It's a little worrisome.
$C: /u/olewinny how scary is this? Feels like a Black Mirror episode opening 
$C: Legit one of the most terrifying videos I've ever seen
$C: Wait so you're saying our democracy is okay then?
$C: Fox meatheads will blame companies for misleading news instead of individuals who are actually responsible for sensationalism they cause. One of the most ironic things I will see this year.

Stop watching cookie cutter news and use academic sources people. Fox is more of a threat to Democracy than social networking ever will be
$C: What a fucking joke we've become. Goddamn fucking carnival sideshow.
$C: I work for another station group called Nexstar; we own 171 local TV stations nationwide and compete head to head with Sinclair in many markets. Glad to say that, so far as I've seen, the corporate level of our company is decidedly hands off concerning news content. 

I got a job offer this last winter and the station was offering quite a bit more than I make now for basically the same job and amount of work... when I saw they were owned by Sinclair I passed on it hard. Even before all this interfering with news content started, they were widely known in the local TV biz to be a bad company to work for.
$C: For certain folks, Animal Farm and 1984 were how to books. 
$C: Thank God for the 100% open and free internet where anyone can say anything and it has the same chance to reach everyone. If not for that oligopolies would be able to do this exact same thing on the internet and slowly make it harder and harder to hear opinions and news they don't agree with.
Oh wait, no, nevermind...
$C: Bots gonna bot
$C: John Oliver did an episode on this concept!
$C: This is what they have been doing against us for at least 75 years. The last 50 years have been This shit right here. Reaching into each of communities and totally fucking us over 😠😠😠😠😠 
$C: It crazy how they own more then one brand. I would have guessed that they just have Fox or just have CBS stations. It looks like they have some of all the the big four (ABC, NBC, Fox and CBS).
$C: I'd give gold but reddit is part of this same problem.
$C: I'm pretty sure ABC and Fox News don't share owners.  This is more an example of Operation Mockingbird (why do you think they named it Mockingbird) at work or perhaps just a bunch of local news outlets picking up a pre-packaged story.
$C: It's funny cause they are describing Fox News 
$C:  sinclair broadcast group at its finest. This is why I don’t watch local TV anymore. 
$C: No matter your political leanings you have to recognize these people are just mouth prices 
$C: Talking heads...
$C: X files theme song
$C: Paging Aldous Huxley...
$C: Wow bro. Talk about a wake up call.
$C: Is there any real news anymore, without spin?
$C: Media outlets *hate* this video!
$C: It's like hearing "these pretzels are making me thirsty" except with "this is extremely dangerous to our democracy"
$C: If you waste your time listening to local news, you're a danger to democrazy. 
$C: This is what happens when people are sheep
$C: So, who is Al Democracy, and why are they in danger?
$C: Yo I fucking flinched when NBC 10 showed up
$C: The fuck has this country come to...
$C: Hitler had a fake news machine too, don't take this shit as a joke people, this is full retarded by them to think they are going to fool you.
$C: I'd feel some strong meme potential in this if this wasn't so *extremely dangerous to our democracy.*
$C: Another reason not to get any news from your tv.
$C: "Local" lol
$C: This post no longer shows up in "best" or "top". 

Censorship going on? 
$C: "This is extreme–
"Fuck it, Jan, I can't do this! Ladies and gentlemen, Sinclair Media, the owner of this station, has been ordering us to read these political screeds on our news programs with alarming frequency, with the purpose of conditioning you, our viewers, to distrust responsible media– ...(finger to earpiece) what's that?...I'm being told...our director...what pictures?...This is extremely dangerous to our democracy!"
$C: This ia not a free press
$C: How did you get here America?? Jesus...
$C: One also has to love just how genuinely concerned they are.
$C: Is it irony that thousands of us are now posting this to twitter and our facebook feeds simultaneously?
$C: You could tell me these are just audition tapes and I would believe you
$C: The more I heard democracy, the less it sounded like a word.
$C: O’er the land of the free...?
$C: There's only one way it would have been even creepier. If at the end, they all got quiet, and the in unison shouted NEXT!
$C: I honestly haven't watched local news since I was 10 years old or so. Holy crap, the narrative on these things has changed since then - eyes would have bugged out of heads 25 years ago if news anchors so blatantly inserted opinion pieces into the news.
$C: Straight up propaganda 
$C: You think that's democracy you're living in now?
$C: I FUCKING TRUSTED YOU, DAVE BONDY OF FOX66 NEWS AT 10!!!
$C: Straight up nightmare fuel....  How bout somebody feed this to Google’s deep neural network and see what gets spit out. 
$C: "Liberal media bias."
$C: I spotted KOKH-TV [Fox 25] [ Oklahoma City], which is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group. All of these local stations in this video are all owned by SBG, who are heavily pro-Republican. However some of their stations are not pro-Republican and have done some passive aggressive moves to give it's owners a subtle "Fuck You".

Also, SBG was featured on HBO's Last Week Tonight with John Oliver:

$C: And surprise, surprise, already disappeared off the front page.
$C: One of the accidental tactics I employed when the kids had recently discovered that shitting in their clothes is a bad idea was to show them, "... making of...",  documentaries of movies they love. I may have spoiled the obligatory childhood experience with monsters under beds and in closets. I have no idea how that will affect them later in life.

By introducing to them likes of Stan Winston's creature creation artistry, movies like PumpkinHead, Aliens, Terminator, Wallace and Grommet unleashed energetic squeals of, "I KNOW HOW THEY DID THAT!!", instead of nightmare-inducing episodes requiring initial consolation followed by a late-night journey into the arms of a parent.

When I first learned that stations owned by Sinclair had been required to read a script on air, my own monsters began to manifest.

My sincerest gratitude to everyone involved in shining light into darkness.

$C: >This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 

Creepy AF.
$C: This is terrifying.
$C: “This is extremely”disturbing...
$C: I used to work behind the scenes in a Sinclair news operation. For that company to have the balls to push the national agenda it does and stand anchors up to do that is amazing.
$C: This is.....this is frightening.
$C: Anyone who hasn't watched the [Last Week Tonight Piece on Sinclair] (https://youtu.be/GvtNyOzGogc) most definitely should.

**If your local news is run by Sinclair, the anchors are required to use the scripts provided and show certain pre-made segments. *Don't harass/abuse your anchors simply because they are reading the scripts. They are likely more pissed off than you are.* With Sinclair in charge, they are unfortunately little more than actors scared for their jobs.**
$C: Me during the first half of the video: "At least it isn't extremely dangerous to our democracy".
$C: One thing about news websites is when they're owned by the same company they are almost identical in layout and graphics.

$C: This is why if I’m going to watch the news, it’s Phillip DeFranco. 
$C: Damn I’m might actually get to see a second revolution in my life time.
$C: John Oliver did a great video on the terrifying thing that is Sinclair media. You thought Comcast could repress the public if net neutrality would go? Think again, this is much worse.
$C: This better be a meme in the next 10 minutes. 
$C: Fuck Sinclair. 
$C: Saw this on our local station after reading about it a few weeks ago. I love how they try to frame it as completely non partisan, and if you didn't know where it came from you might actually believe what they're saying.
$C: At what level do they become the old-school AT&T
$C: KUSA 9news in Denver also had since same script, wasn’t in this clip though 
$C: John Oliver covered Sinclair on Last Week Tonight.

$C: It's a good thing that practically nobody who'll be alive in 25 years watches this garbage.

$C: [Sinclair Broadcast Group: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver \(HBO\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvtNyOzGogc) 
$C: Unplug from the MSM.  This is much bigger than "dozens" of stations.  
$C: Now imagine when they are told to feed Americans that guns are bad... Oh wait...
$C: What’s weird is that you’re don’t see this compilation on CNN and all the liberal stations, but it’s just as bad if not worse.
$C: ...Ajit Pai should kind of have a price put on his head at this point, maybe.
$C: Disgusting scum the lot of them. I hope they get old, look back at their lives and finally realise how high up their asshole they allowed their leaders' hand to get! Shuttered souls and pointless blabbing unconscious puppets.
$C: Are people just waking up to the fact that, these people including big name artist are just puppets to distract the masses from what is really happening 
$C: Holy fucking shit I saw that when I happened! I didn’t realize this was happening. 
$C: How does the video have less views than this post has upvotes?
$C: This is by far one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen. We need to stop this. 
$C: Aaand this is why I don't watch TV anymore. Or pay attention to the news.

Ironically, the thing I hated most about the news as a kid was it was boring, monotonous facts. And now that's all I could wish for.

Edit: less ranty
$C: Everyone. Vote. 
$C: As an Oklahoman, I am for once actually happy that [Griffin Communications](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffin_Communications) exists. They own quite a few tv and radio channels around here but afaik, they're not beholden to anyone, and Channel 6 News is actually top-notch in production value and I feel like while they do have a left lean, they're pretty objective.

Fun fact: Griffin Communications is a subsidiary of Oklahoma's favorite condiment company - [Griffin's Foods.](https://i.imgur.com/gIn9tNP.jpg) Pretty good mustard, actually.
$C: Most fucked up thing ive seen in weeks and i spend more than my fair share of time on r/WTF and r/fiftyfifty 
$C: You can't spell Sinclair without SIN.
$C: FFS. 
$C: Well, that was unsettling. "Television programming," indeed.

This is what I imagined it would be like when we faced Skynet-like robots and AI. It's even stranger somehow to think that it's just other humans. 
$C: As an australian, i find this extremely dangerous to OUR democracy. Everyone has their problems, but the USA's seem insurmountable!
$C: The revolution will not be televised
$C: "Alright now, for this one, use the 'Female D-328' and the 'Male F-882' skins."

"Sir shouldn't we change the bots or idk, re-organize the lines to make them seem realistic?"

"Yeah we could but c'mon we both know that these people will believe whatever we say, so I say just use the same bots every time, but keep changing the skins."

"Alright, you're the boss, boss"
$C: arseholes
$C: About 5 years ago, my local Sincalair owned station posted a video on their Facebook account. One of the comments called them out on their shitty journalism. One of the anchors replied to the comment starting the sentence with "regardless of the truth..." and I lost it. I commented back saying "regardless of the truth? You're a journalist. Your job is to find and report the truth." I got banned from commenting on their Facebook page. 
$C: Moving to the woods now....... don't contact me ever. 
$C: This was already disturbing, then I saw my local news rep and it got very real. Fuck Sinclair. This shit needs to be stopped. 
$C: pay attention, this is not just fox or cnn.. its many partisan news networks. so before anyone goes yapping about how fox, cnn, abc, whatever is fake news... they're all fake news. none of them have your interests at heart. 
$C: This is like watching CNN all day.
$C: Ok, that's scary. 
$C: Damn OP!! You've pulled in a year of gold already! Nice!!!
$C: Lmfaooooo biased posting. Let’s see the other side of the spectrum cnn isn’t any better, abc isn’t any better it’s propaganda both ways. They don’t want YOU AND I to work together and solve problems, instead they pit us against each other 
$C: The same Sinclair that systematically requires all acquisitioned stations to broadcast a "terrorist watch" at least once to twice a day.
$C: This is so scary wow 
$C: Wise up folks, a handful of companies own MOST OF THE MEDIA IN THE WORLD. 

Go deeper
$C: Before social media our only source was corporate sponsored news. The only other option was state sponsored media, which is much worse.

This is why independent journalism and mass journalism thanks to social media is extremely important in modern society. 
$C: This video gave me chills. 
$C: Sad thing is that people want to earn money instead of informing people.
$C: E pluribus unum 
$C: Tip of the iceberg.
$C: So, I take it there weren't any news anchors in any markets who said, that's it, get fucked, I'm not reading that?
$C: whut the even f*ck is going on
$C: Youtube will take this video down. Just give it a few days.
$C: Hey we can comment again.
$C: All of a sudden thrust into an episode of Black Mirror
$C: FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU CCCCCCCKKKKKKK
$C: absolutely revolting *Gordon Ramsay voice
$C: Holy crap 
$C: this is excellent, great work by the editor

$C: Sinclair Media?

Pretty sure Last Week Tonight did the same thing last year?
$C: Xmas time sync https://www.youtube.com/embed/TM8L7bdwVaA
$C: Soundslike it may be extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: This is how sheeple are brainwashed by the media. 
$C: Wowowow
$C: Oh man... Thats extremely dangerous to our democracy..
$C: This is eye opening. 
$C: STEVE HUFFMAN IS A NAZI SYMPATHIZER 
$C: This is honestly fucking scary. Legit, cult like and scary. Insane.
$C: So happy to see this upvoted and gilded.so happy others are ouraged. :Hugs:
$C: THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO OUR DEMOCRACY!! WHAT THE HELL

I heard this speech on my own local station a few days ago and honestly thought to myself how refreshing it was to know that there are some journalists and personalities out there who don't have an agenda to push, this video is such an eye opener. Thank you. 
$C: One of their stations is my local ABC affiliate and I saw this commercial yesterday. Weird stuff. 
$C: Pardon my French but, what a pack of mother fuckers.
$C: Social engineering in full swing
$C: Jessica Headley is hot
$C: I am so glad I do not pay any mind to A N Y of our local news casters.
$C: Sinclair is disgusting
$C: Shouldn't opinion editorials have a disclaimer?
$C: Hey comments are back!
$C: hahahah this is the modern replacement, instead of religious texts to control people they use established mass media which is basically owned by a small number of billionaires.
$C: Oh the hypocrisy, or damage control, or laziness
"Our greatest responsibility is to serve our INSERT LOCAL MUNICIPALITY HERE communities..."
$C: Sounds like the country needs to break out the old anti-trust laws again - target banks and networks.
$C: WE'VE GONE FULL ORWELL, PEOPLE.
$C: This is crazy. What a failure our country has become.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: These orgs are dumb as hell. I don't know about everyone else, but when someone tries to drill in that they are 100% unbiased I trust them much less than people who admit their bias and are willing to look at both sides.
$C: I want out of the Matrix. 
$C: The Admins should explain what happened with this post.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Sinclair is in bed with Donald Trump, and is using their clout to support his presidency, supported by a friendly FCC under Pai.

It just goes to show that when the right wing bitches about the "liberal media", it's all projection.
$C: This democracy is dangerous to our extremity.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: If I hear "this is extremely dangerous to our democracy" one more time..
$C: Pisses me off as to how EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO OUR DEMOCRACY as this is
$C: Fucking pathetic.

$C: [I copy this from Wikipedia as a concerned com major:](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_cross-ownership_in_the_United_States) 

The FCC voted to deprecate the rule in September 2016; the Commission argued that the UHF discount had become technologically obsolete, and that it was now being used as a loophole by broadcasters to contravene its market share rules and increase their market share through consolidation. 

However, on April 21, 2017, under new Trump administration FCC commissioner Ajit Pai, the discount was reinstated in a 2-1 vote, led by Pai and commissioner Michael O'Rielly. The move, along with a plan to evaluate increasing the national ownership cap, is expected to trigger a wider wave of consolidation in broadcast television.


$C: Ah, so fake news is finally in the news... Oh shit, its Newsception.
$C: This is fucking platinum. It will make no difference but damn it's vindicating to see.
$C: This makes me sick. It's very clear that "information" is being pumped out like this from someone or someones behind the curtain. Clear proof that viewers are being spoon fed specific ideas. Propaganda.
$C: Ooo the irony 
$C: Break up Sinclair!

Break up Google!

Break up Hearst!
$C: Feel like I’m watching something from V for Vendetta

$C: Don't get focused solely on Sinclair. nexstar and Gray tv are doing the same thing.
$C: All those MKUltra experiments concluded that the easiest way to mind control people is through mass television narrative.

$C: All your news your news are belong to us. 
$C: TFW when you see your own local news stations in this video...
$C: This makes me horrified and fascinated at the same time.
$C: Don't worry guys, once they see this they will make sure to change up the wording a little when they collude so this doesn't happen again.


$C: :(
$C: Annnd this is why I never watch my local Sinclair station anymore. Fuck those guys.
$C: Jesus, I figured they would at least be allowed to write their own thing, they were all given the same script to lock step their way along.
$C: Absolutely disgusting, too much irony and 1984 for me to respond. America needs to get this bullshit under control, conservatives are calling real news fake news and fake news real news.. 2018 vote blue for sanity.
$C: We were too busy fearing government control of media while the real monster came from the private sector that was supposed to save us.   

We need both government regulation and private freedom in balance to achieve true plurality.
$C: Sinclair?
$C: I just came back to the front page after spending my daily hour on /r/watchpeopledie and this video is by far the most disturbing thing I have ever seen in my entire life.

$C: I’ve always wished a vigilante of sorts could some how hack and interrupt broadcasts and play something simple and powerful like this. 

Some creepy shot yo.
$C: It's the Stepford News
$C: CBS, NBC and ABC do the exact same thing. It’s not limited to FOX. Watch the Sunday morning new shows... they get their talking points from similar sources and most seem to say the same exact thing. Remember when G. W. Bush chose Cheney as his running mate? “Gravitas” was said again and again and again. I had never even heard of he word. That’s when I began noticing the trends. [Gravitas](https://townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/2000/08/01/the-gravitas-game-n739482)

$C: Notice how the youtube comments are real quiet? Wonder what they are going to say about this one.
$C: and they wonder why old media is dying
$C: Well, now I'm suitably spooked.
$C: Sad face.

“This is extremely dangerous to our democracy “
$C: Lmao 
$C: We are the Borg. Resistance is futile.
$C: *this is extremely dangerous for our democracy*

Sounds very similar to:

*for the greater good* but everyone knows we aren't in a Simon Pegg movie. 
$C: I don't know how else to say this. Fuck these people. You're suppose to be the neutral voice to share news. And you're just corporate shills. Jesus fucking Christ. 
$C: This is scary
$C: Just came to say HaHa. . Mind  Control Sucks.
$C: I honestly believe the most successful Republican strategy of the last 30-40 years was to surgically channel the unfathomable economic and social influence, which are an inevitability at the national level of politics, in order to influence the politics and swing elections at the local level. 

Coordinate the legislation through organizations like ALEC. Communicate the message through organizations like Sinclair.
$C: The word democracy lost all meaning by the end of this video.
$C: I noticed this two decades ago on the radio.  Even stations owned by different companies would repeat talking points with minor or no variations in wording.  This sucks ass.  This is _extremely_ dangerous to our democracy.
$C: *wakes up in the middle of the night with cold sweats* 
THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO OUR DEMOCRACY.
$C: Don't they mean extremely dangerous to our oligarchy??

To the elite who attempt to control America??
$C: We are the Borg. Resistance is Futile. Prepare to be assimilated.
$C: DANG IT WE'RE NOT A DEMOCRACY, WE'RE A REPUBLIC
$C: That was terrifying. In a genuinely visceral, literally-shivering-a-bit sort of way.
$C: Holy fuckthis presented in this manner is really terrifying 
$C: This what happens when you take the frugal option of propaganda instead of the deluxe package.

**Me** : I don't watch the MSM. Too biased and too controlled.

**Also me:** I don't do Facebook. I call people or hang out in real life. It's a waste of time and they just use you for data harvesting and advertising anyway. 

**Reddit:** You moron.

- Today 

**Reddit:** OH my God. Facebook is selling our data and manipulating us!

**Also reddit:** What? The news media is controlled by a handful of rich people who control what we see as truth!?*

**Me:**  *Ya don't say!?* Now how about that astro turfing going on with reddit and how organizations are pushing certain stories?



But seriously, mark my words. r/politics has a hard on for anything Trump. And watch how they all act shocked when someone loosely affiliated to him gets arrested, only for him to pardon them like the president can't do that. 

It will be some token nobody too. Someone you never even cared about, but suddenly knowing kw his name cause #Trump. You'll feel like something is being done for about 5 minutes...then he will be quietly pardoned and nothing will change.  Meanwhile you'll be focusing on the latest tweet, and Stormy talking about his dick size. 

People can't even think for themselves. You're being led in circles.
$C: Dear USA,

You can't even USA properly anymore.

Sincerely, the rest of the world

$C: I know someone who works for a station that was recently purchased by Sinclair. The hatred in their eyes whenever they mention the "must-runs" is pure. They rant about the fact that it's propaganda and a bunch of bullshit. Luckily, the rest of the news is normal and legitimate.
$C: I love the "this is extremely dangerous to our democracy"
Sounds like it could be an awesome meme 
$C: Anyone notice how this post with 121k upvotes isn't appearing on best anymore? I even logged off to see if it showed up, nope. 
$C: Holy fuckin shit 23 reddit golds and 125k upvotes in 5 hours !
$C: Dig the editing. Nice job. 
$C: Is that media group in here turning this into a stupid meme so it doesn't gain real traction?



No one is talking about it. It's all just "dangerous to or democracy".




But anyways, people don't give a shit about this stuff. That media group has more power than every bot and piece of fake fake news combined, by a factor of hundreds. But people don't care and never will. 



If Bill Gates or someone decided to pay for this to be blasted out all over the country for a month straight, it might help.
$C: The world is waking up to TPTB...
$C: What can be done about this? 
$C: This post is so good. Top-shelf Reddit post right here. Fucking awesome OP.
$C: Holy shit. Nothing is real anymore is it.
$C: I get a “Borg” like hive mind feel from this.
$C: This is scary and the repercussions are and will grow more intelligent and damaging. Very sad for us and the future generations. 
$C: Un fucking real.  Easily one of the most disturbing things I've seen over the last couple of years, and that's saying a lot.
$C: This youtube video should win an oscar. So spine tingling! 
$C: THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO OUR DEMOCRAZY 
$C: It's a good thing we have a republic, not a democracy, or we might be in some real trouble there. /s

$C: This seems like a good time to stock up on food and ammunition 
$C: THESE PRETZELS ARE MAKING ME DEMOCRACY! 
$C: Blow up your tv, throw away your paper, move to the country, build you a home. Have a bunch of children, plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches, try to find Jesus on your own.
$C: This is so fucked
$C: All I have to say is watch YouTube, listen to long format podcasts, read reddit, and stay away from mainstream everything. 
$C: LO fucking L. This is terrifying
$C: thats creepy af
$C: Mic drop
$C: I was tipped off about this video existing, I found it very easily over on YT but it took me some effort to get to the post on here. I had to have a friend send me the url as it were...

The fuck.
$C: Share share share!!! Share this everywhere !!! Creepy stuff 
$C: This is incredible. Holy shit. 
$C: April fools joke
$C: Dozens? You mean 72% of US Media. 

How did this happen? See Fairness in Media Act (90's) and Telecommunications Act (80's)
$C: Soulless. Absolutely soulless.
$C: This is how you kill capitalism, free press, and democracy.  Just slowly own it all and you own the country.

Ah well, off to /awwww
$C: Monopolistic TV news organization talks down competition that renders old media obsolete, masks it as concern for "democracy."  
$C: Scary. As equally scary as Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. curating everything you see, or are allowed to see.
$C: THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO OUR DEMOCRACY !
$C: Mr Robot is real.
$C: They are just herding the sheep. Keeping everyone in line. People don't even realize it, but that's how the system is setup up to be. 
$C: et tu katu?
$C: How can billionaires be so fucking stupid? I'm done with corporations. Hail the democrats, socialize everything and cripple them. 
$C: I have more faith in Half-Life 3 coming out than the news.
$C: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stations_owned_or_operated_by_Sinclair_Broadcast_Group
$C: Locking this post would be extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: This was extremely disturbing 
$C: Dude! That's actually freaking scary as fuck..it's like the movie "they live".
$C: DEAR HEAVEN! SO THIS IS WHAT THEY MEAN BY A MEDIA CONSPIRACY
$C: Hahaha I work somewhere they recorded these. I saw our anchors 3 diff times. They show this segment once every hour the last 3 weeks. It's fucking awful. I hate them. (The anchors, they're really not good people)
$C: This weirdly reminds me of the Head On commercials.
$C: Top class editing.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Damn, now I really wanna go buy some Dangerous Democracy. Damned targeted adverts, they know exactly what you want.
$C: I feel fucking brainwashed just watching this
$C: TIL Sinclair is to local news as Pearson is to the education system
$C: The station I work for isn't in this compilation, but I will say that everyone I work with hated they had to read that.
$C: What in the absolute fuck did i just watch
$C: I saw one of my local newscasters in this, I feel used.
$C: I'M MAD AS HELL AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE
$C: This is seriously disturbing. 

What do we do about this stuff? How do we change this?
$C: The media, what a joke! Wake up people
$C: The OP got so much gold.... are there any other videos that got this many golds?
$C: Who just exposed the matrix to us? Buy that person a beer and some emp's. 
$C: THE GREATER GOOD

-Hot Fuzz
$C: This is surreal as fuck 
$C: Extremely 
$C: My sister's boyfriend works for a local news station and the last time I was home we had a conversation about these companies that own a bunch of local news stations. I didn't know that these companies existed til he told me about it. I maybe wrong but isn't it like 3-5 companies that own all the local stations?
$C: They Live!
$C: x37 gold. Jesus.
$C: Top post all time I'm calling it
$C: When viewing, Search for "Sinclair Broadcast Group: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver" so we can get Youtubes algorithm to link the two videos together.
$C: 138k upvotes and x37 gold in just 6 hours of posting. HOLY COW! 
$C: Am I the only curious if this works the same way with Turner broadcasting?
$C: I agree this is creepy and dystopian, but it's always been a talking head saying something that another person put in front of them. There should be no surprise that the corporation would pay one writer for 100 stations rather than 100 writers.  I don't see any way around it except awareness (this post is a good start).
$C: Don't know if anyone will see it, but worth the try.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent

A book which explains this kind of phenomenon
$C: And this is why I dont watch or trust the main stream media.

The revolution will not be televised.

$C: I love some anchors seem want to look professional so people can believe them, while others appear more concerned/genuine so that people can believe them. Yet compiled like this they all look and sound the same. This is something straight out of a horror movie.
$C: good reminder that newscasters are not journalists, they're actors

they just read anything you put on the prompter
$C: gilded x38 in 6 hours, holy shit
$C: Jesus Christ. 36 golds. Is that a record?
$C: The one silver lining?  The majority of Americans born after 1980 can see right through this garbage.
$C: Holy shit, 38 gold's. This is the highest post I've ever seen.
$C: How many years this been going on? 
$C: New drinking game. Drink everyone you hear the word democracy in this video. 
$C: "The following announcement has been paid for from the New World Order"
$C: I mean, they're not wrong
$C: This is just terrifying. 
$C: I was here.
$C: Fuck.
$C: Needs to be the top post of all time. Means more than the senator. 
$C: Wow this is so scary
$C: Fake news
$C: "It's extremely dangerous to our democracy"

Well first of all, do you actually have a democracy? 
$C: Sound the alarm bells for our democracy. 
$C: Is this now one of the most upvoted posts on Reddit?
$C: Do any of us young cats still watch TV? 
$C: >This is what happens when one *EVIL* company owns dozens of local news stations

FTFY
$C: I think it's high time we all ignored cable news. The only two news sources I trust to be (reasonably) accurate are the BBC and Reuters. Both are based in the UK.

I wonder how much Russian money has been funneled into Sinclair. 
$C: 40 fucking golds. Jesus
$C: first found out about this from [a Conan video from a few years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM8L7bdwVaA)
$C: Thats what happens when entire media is owned by 6 corporations...
$C: We live in a democracy?
$C: >news media in america is corrupted by corporate and state interests

oh wow... who woulda guessed? 
$C: Holy Fucking shit...
What year is it? 1984?
$C: Watching this for myself and it's so surreal. Like this was all done for an April fool's joke that all stations would use the same script. Jokes on us.
$C: I work for a newstation, that will obviously remain anonymous, as a Technical Director and reporter. Aaaaaand this scares me a bit. Like career change worthy..
$C: Cool. Oh... ummm... extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: And this is why the US is broken. Corrupt businesses and politicians.
$C: I desperately hope this never gets deleted
$C: Yeah, and? Print/web media works the same way through Reuters and The Associated Press. 
$C: "--platforms push their own personal bias and agenda to control how people think", say the 36 TV channels simultaneously with the same exact message.
$C: This is extremely dangerous.

To our democracy.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.

This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.

This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.

*Chat disabled for 3 seconds*
$C: Don’t watch while fried, my dudes. 
$C: Some lazy ass script writer just leaned back in his chair mouthing the words "fuck, fuck, fuck." His craft that ensures he only has to do 20-hours of real work a week has been exposed. 
$C: I thought this kinda sucked until I saw my main news station. My stomach dropped. 
$C: Thank you. Thank you so much. I’m in tears, sitting on the can. Thank you
$C: Very Mr.Robot-esque
$C: FFS, can the world just...  not be so fucked?  For once?  It's really starting to bum me out
$C: 42 gilds so far. This person is gonna have reddit gold for the rest of their life at this rate 
$C: is this the highest guilded post ever? holy shit
$C: Turns out that anchors are more actors than journalists 
$C: Imagine what this country will look like in 10 years...that is scary
$C: FEAR FEAR FEAR. FEAR EVERYWHERE. So be sure to watch our programs so we can tell you what to think and how to protect yourself!
$C: Waiting for Max Headroom to make another entrance.  I’ll keep waiting.
$C: Disturbing content is right, holy shit.
$C: This is infinitely terrifying on so many levels. Especially because we know a major failsafe to a situation like this comes from the government. 

What is this hell that we live in?
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy 
$C: [I've got one that can see...](https://youtu.be/eNxQFNMchOM)
$C: this is the point of the news is to control population.  Programing Television programming get it?? 
$C: Everyone that watched it should have liked the video on youtube, 91k updoots here and only 25k on the video. Get it up there so people will recognize that it's a problem, everything is true on the Internet and everything is scripted on tv.
$C: The FBI CIA is after your ass. You are a threat to their democracy.
$C: I think I'm gonna throw up
$C: April's Fools, right guys?? Haha, Right? RIGHT?!
$C: And this is why I sometimes consider Conspiracy theories to actually be correct.
$C: Well shit
$C: The irony
$C: Is that one company called US govt?
$C: I have never seen anyone get this much gold before in my life.
$C: I’m definitely getting a strong, thinly-veiled and unsettlingly-repetitive, vibe from this video. 

Where can I get a job at  that pays over 100 news anchors to say the same thing, to different people, over and over again, while also saying he word local, and the name of which city they are talking to?

I want this as a T shirt nowwww!!’
$C: Let's dispense with the fiction that Sinclair Broadcasting doesn't know what they're doing. Sinclair Broadcasting knows exactly what they are doing. 
$C: People are looking at this as if the newscasters are incorrect. We’ve seen what Facebook can do. Sinclair is just an alternative faction. Whether it’s talking heads on tv or your mom spamming retweets you’re just choosing one bubble over another. Reddit is not immune. The more time I spend here the more convinced I am that half of it is AstroTurf.
$C: This post has so much gold stashed that it's asking for a tax cut 
$C: Good to see this post getting some traction.  Now the #2 of all time in this sub.
$C: Holy fuck I have chills
$C: Who the fuck still watches local news on television?
$C: No surprise here.  Ajit is a cunt!  Our system is being played by cunts for centuries.  The constitution is just a front and these cunts doing live shows behind it at will to serve their end goal = money.

Sad reality.
$C: That awkward moment when you live in the Treasure Valley community...
$C: Reminds me of [this video](https://youtu.be/TM8L7bdwVaA)
$C: The hypocrisy here is that nothing they said was false, only that they are the culprits not the victims
$C: How is this post not on r/all ? 
$C: Maybe I'm wrong about how Top All Time is calculated, but at 167k upvotes, this post looks like it should be #5 all time, but it isn't even listed. What's up with that?
$C: [deleted]
$C: This is sobering. Propaganda is alive and well in America.
$C: [deleted]
$C: this is exactly why I'm against tax breaks for the rich. They can simply control everybody else with shit like this and advertising. They are the big dogs and we are mere sheep.
$C: This is scary af
$C: It's simple, don't watch the news.
$C: Hoooooooly fucking shit.
$C: I'm sharing this with my journalism professors asking what they think. 

This really needs to be seen by everyone.
$C: The irony drips from their mouths as they slam social media. 
$C: America is rotten to the core. WW3 soon so we can conquer it.
$C: disturbing content? wot
$C: It was funnier when Conan did it.
$C: Hey El paso made it on there!.... 

Oh that's no bueno
$C: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dguiAWrUGMM

Something similar on Conan
$C: Drones, they are all drones!!!!!! 
$C: SOMEONE GET TEDDY ROOSEVELT UP IN HERE AND BREAK DOWN THAT MONOPOLY!!!
$C: I haven't owned a TV in more than a decade and this gives me know reason to. Non-gamer. 
$C: Help me guys I'm super drunk
$C: Omg I just started having a slight panic attack 
$C: @<your local news station>

> Is Sinclair Broadcasting Group #DangerousToOurDemocracy?
$C: It's like trying to pick out a voice for your skyrim character. 
$C: Some crazy shit but a lot of conspiracy theorists on reddit are now making false claims over everything
$C: Can someone explain in ELI5 terms the message this video is attempting to convey?
$C: Holy fuck 
$C: SEMANTIC SATIATION
$C: C'mon Rage Against the Machine, release a single.
$C: Corruption is everywhere no matter where you are. The sooner you learn this the better equipped you are. It's the same everywhere just dressed up differently: USA, Canada, Russia, UK, France, Norway, China, Korea etc... Fundamentally we humans are flawed species. Unless there's an overhaul of our DNA structure to remove the evil traits, apocalypse is inevitable, and it's really just a matter of when. Just look around, we're destroying everything including ourselves. Knowing this truth does not mean we have to accept it. Never stop fighting!
$C: And this is why I no longer watch the news
$C: 49 GOLD? Holy shit 
$C: [THEY LIVE](https://i.imgur.com/KkTgsC4.jpg)
$C: this is why i dont watch main stream news nor do i read main stream news outlets
$C: I feel for you guys. Love from the Netherlands.
$C: The work effort put into this video. Holy shit. Also these journlists must feel so extremely stupid.
$C: Yep... The media
Absolutely doesn't receiving talking points from the government.
Not at all
$C: Reddit is no longer the place it was, even with the post being brought back there are still a great many things that have been hidden.
$C: i've given up on this schizoid life. Ive decided im gonna move to new mexico, way out in a small town, I'd rather cultivate/live inside of my own social weirdness than have my brain tuned to these sub conscious psuedo occult frequencies. Peace Y'all I Suggest U Guys Do The Same
$C: You could stop at five or six stores..

*Or just one* ☝️ 
$C: Oh my god. This is the scariest thing I've seen all week.
$C: This is Goebbels' wet dream. 
$C: It's like one person wrote an essay and sold it to 50 people who all submitted it to the same university.
$C: Anyone have the full script?
$C: So basically they can make you think on their terms and dictate your emotions and evoke biases. No more independent thoughts except what they will you into thinking is independent thought.
$C: Monkey needs a hug.
$C: Reminds me of the repeated line from Hot Fuzz. "For the greater good".
$C: This is basically my office in the morning when my coworkers tell me about reddit's front page.
$C: I’m as tinfoil hat as the next guy, but to me this just really demystified what being a news anchor is. It’s sort of like fast food. There’s a certain recipe that all the Taco Bells follow to make a taco. And when this news station has a story for the whole network, they just copy paste their script.

The difference being the local news stories that change it up.

If lizards were really controlling media they wouldn’t make it this obvious. 


...I think
$C: *checks date* is this a joke?
$C: As a free speech loving internet rational skeptic libertarian centrist, I'm appalled. I thought giant media corporations knew what was best for me? I thought both sides were equally as bad? 

I'm just dumbfounded 
$C: anyone sitting on the top posts of all time to see this hit #25 and the first page, just to see everytime it surpasses #25, a new post appears and raises the bar? What the fuck is going on, seriously someone tell me im not imagining this
$C: Good thing TV news is dying and we have the internet...for now 
$C: The free market will sort this right out
$C: This is already front page of all time with 193k upvotes!

$C: I don't know what to do. No one around me even seems to know or care what Sinclair is. Is there anything I can do besides share on social media, be aware of which channels are compromised, and vote in every election?
$C: 54 golds and counting
$C: Everyone upvoting this should begin a coup d'etat on Sinclair 
$C: I feel like I just watched a segment from one the Purge movies. 
$C: I've always hated watching the news. This video doesn't highlight anything new unfortunately, and it won't change either. Kudos for editing it together though, the ending really did drive the point home. Think for yourself and question everything, especially mass media.
$C: Fucking puppets.    

People ask me why I don't watch the news. There you go.
$C: This is extremely dangerous.....to our democracy. 
$C: is this the pinnacle of capitalism?
$C: [anyone surprised by this should read this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_cross-ownership_in_the_United_States) and [this](http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6) and later [this](https://www.amazon.com/Manufacturing-Consent-Political-Economy-Media-ebook/dp/B0055PJ4R0)
$C: Well, this is fucking scary. 
$C: by the way, is this popular enough to no longer be disturbing?

Mods are cancer smh
$C: Democracy isn’t even a word to me anymore it’s just a noise 
$C: And here I thought, that's a good April fools.
$C: What is the record for gold on a post?

$C: Are people really surprised by this? ALL media is controlled and manipulated. Always has been, always will be. That’s what I find so ironic about all this “fake news” talk, it’s always been fake news...all of it. 
$C: https://act.credoaction.com/sign/stop_sinclair_tribune
$C: 55x Reddit gold. Gotta be one of the highest I have seen.
$C: The most upvoted post in this sub, congratulations
$C: Well you gotta give them credit for one thing at least: They are not putting their own opinions and values first. HAHAHAHA
$C: I’m a little troubled that a huge amount of people will see this on April Fools day.  I shouldn’t be.  But I am.  
$C: In Germany our great grandparents called this Gleichschaltung and you came to bomb the shit out of it.

$C: Can someone please explain the core concerns for this? Apart from the narrative of the same messages on all the channels. Not everyone is American
$C: [Sinclair's Wikipedia page](https://i.redd.it/4r6wj0jt5ap01.png)
$C: News Channel: fake news is damaging our country.

Consumer: you're absolutely correct!

New Channel: "feeds consumer fake news and propaganda"

Consumer: "gleefully accepts everything News channel spits out because of one correct statement that adheres to the consumers preception.

PSA: propaganda was legalized in 2012.


$C: USA is the greatest USSR in the world.
$C: When you own the information, you own how it's spread.
$C: U... Unity? 
$C: Whoever made this video is either dead or has a really solid anti-goverment bunker.
$C: Yeah but some guy on Twitter said CNN doesn't show the other side so this is totally okay. The level of stupidity of these people is mind blowing and it's only going to get worse.
$C: Presented to you by: Capitalism.
$C: One company owning dozens of news stations, "this is extremely dangerous to our democracy."
$C: Amazing. 


I mean not the issue, the editing. 
$C: And nobody says a thing about how two huge companies control 90% of radio stations?  K
$C: Whaaaaat the shiiiiiiiit......
$C: It's really sad and scary how they are manipulating people. 
$C: Wow - this beat the Ulimate Progress Picture.
$C: Unfortunately another consequence of the 1996 Telecommunications act passed by President Clinton. Deregulated the protections against media consolidation as well as no longer making the news media serve the public good or be unbiased.
$C: "To begin with, we're not what you'd call "human." Over the past 200 years, a consciousness appeared layer by layer at the crucible of the White House. It's not unlike life started in the oceans four billion years ago. The White House was our primordial soup, a base of evolution. We are formless. We are the very discipline and morality that Americans invoke so often. How can anyone hope to eliminate us? As long as this nation exists, so will we."
$C: We're gonna make our own deep state... with black jack! And hookers!
$C: I went to bdd last night when this had 16 Reddit gold, now it has 60.. wow!
$C: Hello... is this Elon? Are you still looking for colonists for Mars?
$C: [Manufacturing Consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent)
$C: to be fair it looks like a memo that was mass emailed or something and they were told to change the name to fit their station or something
$C: Dozens? Haha. Six corporations own 90%+ of all media outlets. Thanks to Bill Clinton for starting the deregulation, and every other administration since for keeping it rolling. 
$C: Democracy is another word for mob rule. I get that it's a meme, but it really is a dangerous one. These shills pretending to be honest media are a threat to our constitutional republic... but then again, the very f'ing existence of the fed has been that for decades. In the end this is more of what everyone already knows, its just great when someone puts it all together like this. Adds quite the perspective. 
$C: The Karma!!!!! The Gold!!!!!
OP hit the Jackpot!
$C: 226k upvotes, humanity. Right on!
$C: 63 Gold on this Post. Today we break Reddit!!!!
$C: When they started speaking in sync it game me the hibbie jibbies.
$C: Upvote and forget.
$C: Dunno if this has been mentioned but this video has the perfect preload image -- you can tell the girl in purple is really worried about democracy.
$C: Sinclair Broadcast group guys, it's scary. 
$C: WTF, why is this not on the top of the front page, or even at the top of r/videos?
$C: But I think the question remains, is this extremely dangerous to our democracy?
$C: Man... Fuck living in the USA right now.
$C: Fucking scary. Be sure to watch the video cued after this one.

https://youtu.be/zNhUk5v3ohE
$C: 1.45 Million YouTube Views. It's also not trending; That's not surprising, ~~Corporate Emperors~~ ~~Moneyed Interests~~ ~~Your Puppet Masters~~ Google doesn't want to promote something so ~~offensive~~ ~~exposing~~ *disruptive* to the status quo.
$C: Now this dude has like six years worth of gold and I'm all just sitting here posting pictures of my cat
$C: Been there for a while, Australia says hi. It's the same here with News Corp, in particular Murdoch uses his monopoly over lots of newspapers to push our conservative parties LNP. All of which is sickening to me especially when people in the past year like to grandstand over corporate censorship on social media sites saying it's their platform and they can run you off as much as they like. Well this is what you are cheering on.
$C: Is this not on the front page? I am looking at r/all, sorting it every way possible, and still not seeing it...

Edit: found it, sort by Top>Today. Hopefully this sticks to All Time
$C: This is *extremely* dangerous to our democracy

These *pretzels* are making me *thirsty*

$C: Jesus fucking christ 5 years of gold

Also most upvoted post in the history of the site
$C: I'm not even American and this is genuinely terrifying.
$C: wew
$C: Having a background in journalism, at the beginning I thought, "That's just plague news."

By the end I felt sick to my stomach and needed a pacifier to suck on but I don't own a baby so I ended up sucking my own dick. 

:(
$C: THIS just made so much clearer what i already knew. This is terrifying.
$C: The News™ is a business. 

Because there have been reporters who have done fantastic jobs in the past (and as some still do), made real and important changes to our society, doesn't mean that everyone who uses the title of "journalist" or anything related to that is somehow exempt from critical judgement or can use the shield of free speech to conduct their business. 

Distribution of information lives in the same capitalist ecosystem as every grocery chain, appliance company, local plumber, etc and has the same goals as most - survive and be profitable.

No matter their political lean, don't just get hooked onto whatever they're putting out. Consider all sides but have some reservation about what you accept.
$C: I don't see anyone discussing Tribune Media's assests, so here's a [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribune_Broadcasting) of what Sinclair would be acquiring should their deal with them get approved by the FCC.
$C: I hate Sinclair
$C: I started with my mouth closed.

Finished with my mouth open.
$C: April fools?
$C: Those 7 words are burned into my brain.

THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO OUR DEMOCRACY

$C: If this were in some film about a corporate takeover plot against the us government we would be creeped out and outraged. But it happens for real and we are like, “meh”. 
$C: How do we stop this?
$C: This "one company" is extremely dangerous tor our democracy,I guess
$C: Imagine the video ended with repeating "This is extremely dangerous to our democracy" but each time was deeper and more distorted.
$C: What's really scary as someone has started to point out is, when the corps or big comps or powerful entities catch wind that you're on to them, they will change their future actions so "it doesn't happen again". 

Covering up the truth, being unethical, getting bailed out or not punished, and we the people seem to really complain the most when shit has finally hit the fan, but before that point everything is fucked anyway. We can't possibly keep up with the ill behavior going on and they just run from us and look after themselves.

I know people like John Oliver is saying wake up and revolt, here's what's happening ,protect yourself. To me this feels like a deep problem, and I feel that its tied to money and power and while those two things still exist, cherish the freedom you have and vote and shit but damn. After all we are just intelligent animals so what do you expect. It appears that this whole country just eats away at the forbidden fruit. 

I want to add a final thought, something that crossed my mind, if we only seem to protest when we find out the truth or shit hits the fan... They may say what do you care you are only bitching about it because its a big topic right now, and everyone is bitching so you're just hopping on the bandwagon, you never cared about this issue before. That may be true but its because you were hiding the truth all along and it wasn't a fair game otherwise we would have a problem with it a long time ago. 

Like I said a much deeper problem, this is my opinion


$C: Why is thread hidden when you enter r/videos, except when you go search top post. Mod what is the reason for this?
$C: This has to be a record for Reddit gold.
$C: this is very dangerous to our demockeracy
$C: Solution: Turn off your television. You have the power!!!!!
$C: 1984.
$C: Since you found out, let me introduce you guys to Unity. We sort of used to...date.
$C: "The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command... and if all others accepted the lie, which the party imposed, if all records told the same tale, then the lie passed into history and became truth" 1984 - George Orwell
$C: Obey obey 
$C: THIS REDDIT RESPONSE is what happens when people get a chance to vote without being manipulated for 16 months.
$C: Holy crap. This from The Truman Show: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxFj4iNmsJE&t=1m48s
$C: Oh yay, my local station is owned by them. How wonderful... I'll be sure to tell my parents to stop watching them.
$C: This comment signifies I, sunMaster9000, was a part of Reddit history.
$C: [This lady from KATV in Little Rock](https://i.imgur.com/6awfqrV.jpg) is really sad about how extremely dangerous this is to our democracy.
$C: Extremely disgusting.
$C: In before locked
$C: two things might curtail this slide. Restore the fairness doctrine and place stricter regulation on monopolies. Not going to happen anytime soon but one can wish.
$C: There is no fake news within the walls.  
Here we are safe.  
Here we are free.
$C: "I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!" Network 1976.  Well, maybe just another 40 years.
$C: Orwell warned us for this
$C: And Trump has now praised Sinclair.

🙃
$C: This isn't new...it's been a running joke about TV News for a while now. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZVv2AOCnaA
$C: bumping for visability
$C: That moment when that crazy cracked head everyone hate was telling tell the truth.

"They hated him because he told the truth" 
$C: I watched this while listening to sungha jung's guitar version of "someone like you" in the background and it was extremely chilling 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34r0ZcaOYdw
$C: This is no laughing matter these are Pro Trump stations just like RT for Putin. 
$C: Is there any interest in an AMA with someone who works at Sinclair?
$C: All the national US media is owned by 5 or 6 dudes. ( it was 5 a year ago, I think some bit of it was sold recently ). This is not a local or partisan issue. Listen to the wording of any story on Trump next time he does something actionable. Every station words it the exact same with no thought at all. 
$C: u/ih8mypp are you scared this will take your posts place as the most upvoted post on reddit?
$C: Did not know it was this bad wow
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our plutocracy...I mean democracy.
$C: How dangerous is this to our democracy?
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Hey can someone explain to me what is bad about Sinclair? This is the first time I've heard anything on this subject. 
$C: It's not any worse, in a way, as a single news source with the same reach as the combined reach of all these local news stations, is it?  Watch out for CNN and Oprah for propaganda, too, is all Im saying.  
$C: Never good when one company has so much power over the news!
$C: Why isn't this on top of all? 
$C: now the word democracy sounds weird to me 
$C: Always do your own research. 
$C: At the end there i got the weird feeling that Democracy wasn't a real word....Democracy...Democracy...DEMocRacy....DemOCracY...Dem...Oc...Racy.....
$C: Nothing is wrong here keep walking sheeple, nothing is wrong
$C: Something tells me this is extremely dangerous to our democracy. I could be wrong.
$C: Wow. The paranoid foilhats of the 90s were right.

Again..
$C: What they say is true , their trash news reporting is dangerous to our democracy
$C: I'm on reddit way more than I care to admit...but it never showed up on my fp? Just happened to be sorted by top by accident, wtf is this reddit illuminati shit. 
$C: How long til Sinclair bot accounts down vote this into non-existence? Better hurry and pick it up lol. 266k votes amazing 
$C: Still only hear yanni. Starting to get scared.
$C: These pretzels are making me thirsty. 
$C: Now this is dangerous to our democracy.
$C: I feel like I'm descending into a bad trip but I haven't taken anything
$C: It's eerie isn't it? 
$C: Immortalizing myself with this 4-month-late comment. I don't watch local news. I don't watch any news channels. The only news I get is from Reddit and my Alexa flash briefing (which includes Reuters, Forbes, NPR, and the BBC). I didn't know this was a problem. Take control of your media, people. Don't let them do this. The saddest thing about the American People is how they so often forget they're the ones with all the power. It's only when we give it up do we reach situations like this.
$C: Skynet is now self aware
$C: Commenting for link.
$C: I was a part of this.
$C: I'm just waiting for the day when one of these anchors blinks, in morse code, an SOS of some kind.
$C: This scary man get me outta here
$C: Low on data can someone give me the tldw
$C: Oh God.
$C: Never forget
$C: At times like this i am reminded, here in India, we can clearly see each news channel as being biased towards one political party and attacking the others. 

But this in the long run seems better than this "everything is fine" propaganda as it usually puts to the fore things which are not as it should be.
$C: It's so ironic, If the "fake news" has plagued our society , what the hell do you call this word for word verbatim reading of the exact same script? 
$C: This is just a sample of how TV and Movies can slowly brainwash the public into thinking the same thing.
$C: I’m starting to think that maybe the allies lost wwii and we are living in a axis fascist propaganda world 
$C: President Trump is a symptom of the dysfunction that is our overwhelmingly capitalistic society.  
$C: John Oliver did a segment on this a while ago. It indeed is some scary shit

edit: link is here https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GvtNyOzGogc
$C: Are we the baddies?
$C: u/washingtonpost this is the most chilling piece of video that I have seen in modern times. Please feature it on the digital product.
$C: Russianification of the USA

So glad I'm leaving this shithole.
$C: So, wait.. Is this extremely dangerous to our democracy?
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: They're gonna talk about this on the next H3 podcast. I just know it. I can already hear Ethan shouting "THIS IS DANGEROUS TO OUR DEMOCRACY"
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Or you have a network like CNN that is national and international to fool the entire world at the same time.  
$C: The reason this has so many upvotes is because the left and right will think it only applies to the other side. So everyone will upvote it.
$C: I wish I had the editing skills and resources to gather and splice those sound bite into a video featuring all the fake narrative Trump and his cronies have been pumping into the media.

Trump -> threat to democracy -> Fox -> threat to democracy -> Conway -> threat to democracy ... and so on.

All the lies.

All the propaganda.

All the false narratives spread by the pseudo state media.


$C: This type of thing has been going on for a while. The type of people who started exposing these kinds of things are the conspiracy theorists that lots of people like to make fun of.  Yet most of these things are true. This is eerily the kind of thing JFK talked about in that famous speech. I hope this helps people start looking for truth and see past the agenda.

$C: This is the most important Reddit post ever.
$C: Honestly this is how I feel the world is becoming. Just graduated college last year, and everyone seems to think they are unique or original in their thinking, yet all I see/saw was people all thinking exactly the same way but claiming originality.

If you were a republican or a Christian, you were in the wrong or you were labeled as the close minded one. Everyone agreed on everything at its core yet masked it in different colors. 

It makes me think of 1984. 
$C: Seriously. Fuck Fox News. 
$C: These are the Sinclair stations. Their management is forcing them to read this on air. Sinclair is the pro trump media outlet of local news 🙄
$C: add fox news channel 10 to that list, Arizona :)
$C: [deleted]
$C: So who can I believe?  Fake news on the Internet.  Scripted news on the nightly 5pm.  Sigh.  We're all just being fed what "they" want us to know.  
$C: Dozens? More like 208 after Sinclair finalizes their purchase of Tribune.   
How did Trump get elected....
Yeppp
$C: Everybody needs to see this 
$C: As someone who lives around this area. It’s really absurd how true it is. It seems like there’s no difference in news channels when I flip around, it’s funny for a bit then kinda sad and annoying.
$C: I don't know anyone who watches the news anymore. Must be a generation thing.
$C: this needs to be shared more
$C: And this post is Fake news and OP is russian

— US Media
$C: I hate that news anchor tone they have, like the forceful emphasis on "This is extremely dangerous for our democracy" 

Fuck off and don't tell me what's dangerous for my democracy bitch 
$C: I work at one of these stations and got in trouble for sharing this video...
$C: Sounds like NBC, CBS, ABC, MSNBC, CNN, NY Times, LA Times and all the other mainstream media outlets with the fake Trump Russia collusion.
$C: A bunch of non-thinking muppets. A shameful display from all involved.
$C: [deleted]
$C: It's like something out of a horror movie.
$C: This is unbelivable. I sincerely hope America can shake this highly troublesome trend of masquerading a clearly paid for propaganda message as local media. As so called allies of the US, we are thoroughly influenced by your actions and methods, please be better than this.
$C: This has actually been going on for a long time. Those reptilian conspiracy theorists are pretty nuts, but this has been pointed out before: https://youtu.be/jH8dejYGa5A

As they say a stopped clock is right twice a day
$C: Why are people surprised that the company would want consistency regarding his “open”?  Show me where they are colluding on a fake story and you have something.  This just seems like a company viewpoint they wanted expressed the same way.  Nothing to see here. 
$C: Is this Sinclair?
$C: this is 90% of media already
$C: >hit "open in browser," opens in YouTube
>first thing I notice is only has 18k views and 7k upvotes
>this thread is over 50k

Hmmmmm
$C: Masterfully done.  This is why monopolies are bad.  And yes im a t_d posting, capitalist pig
$C: They think we live in a democracy LOL
$C: Guys hear me out, I have a hunch that this is extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: And this shouldn't surprise anyone, but the highers ups at Sinclair include multiple people with Russian ties, including a former Trump crony named Boris Epshteyn.
$C: *Hello Reddit historians!*
$C: *extremely* dangerous to our democracy 

Include me in the screenshot pls 
$C: This thread is getting brigaded the fuck out of.
$C: My question is who the fuck watches local TV news??

ohhh...i know who...ugh, never mind
$C: Sinclair owns a lot of local television stations but they only *potentially* reach about 40 million Americans *if* they even choose to tune in. The actual viewership is going to be a lot lower than that. 

Meanwhile, do you think that percent figure is higher or lower than fucking Disney? Globally, Viacom alone *potentially* reaches 4.3 billion across the world (though many of those cannot even afford a cable subscription much less food). 
$C: "Everyone else is fake news but us"

This message brought to you by brietbart, info wars, and fox news. 
$C: Think for Yourself - Question Authority
$C: Rofl @ America. You guys crack me up.
$C: And the real irony is that the exact same thing is happening here on reddit: you have bots and paid shills to spam narratives and talking points on this website.
$C: Now this (no pun intended) is MSM propaganda: https://nowthisnews.com/videos/politics/fox-news-different-reactions-regarding-negotiations-with-north-korea
$C: This is the Republican vision for America. 
$C: Fake news. Trump was right
$C: This is part of their BRAINWASHING tactics. There are subconscious messages going into people's heads when they here this. They are getting closer to 100% human control, VERY SCARY.
$C: Brought to you by the Ministry of Truth.
$C: This keeps dropping from the front page... Conspiracy much
$C: We live in a republic....
$C: Fuck you mods and /u/spez for trying to cover up the truth 
$C: PBS explaining this is more detail - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNhUk5v3ohE&ab_channel=PBSNewsHour 
$C: I was talking with a friend from Turkey not long ago.  Their point:  It all seems normal, then you notice nonsense and polarization, a strongman spouting transparently stupid things, etc.  

*Then they control the media*.

That is where my friend said it turned for the worst in Turkey.  Until the media aligned with Erdogan, there wasn't much support for the anti-intellectual purge of dissidents from society.  Once the media aligned with Erodogan, people were imprisoned and the resistance was undermined.

I'm telling the U.S. citizenry - strike and force the government to work for you now, or regret it later.
$C: Does anyone remember when this happened during gamergate, then happened again later multiple times running up to the 2016 election and conservatives got really up in arms over it?

No?

So this is new to you guys?

Welcome to "Why the mainstream media should be entirely ignored from here on out".  We call this phenomenon **"heads of the hydra"** and it's pretty scary when you hear the same phrases on 20 segments but those phrases are all actual propaganda targeting your voting bloc or your party in general.  I'm not wildly surprised that the left is just now noticing this since they only care about what affects them in the moment.
$C: [deleted]
$C: [deleted]
$C: I hate ur shitty corrupted country 
$C: My God. They gave news anchors a script. When did they start doing this? jfc. I'm terrified.

What's more terrifying is the content of the script. They said it's bad for national news to air biased stories without facts. That's simply unacceptable. I expect biased stories without facts. 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: Yeah.....and if you think left-leaning news staff didn’t have a stranglehold on local newsrooms before this, you are sorely mistaken.  From shady hiring practices, skewed editing and script writing and biased reporting at the local level, it would make any true journalist puke.  One particular anchor I worked with had a “Proud Democrat” wooden sign at his desk IN THE NEWSROOM.  That sign stayed there for at least 15 years and nobody said a damn word.
Not saying at all this script is a good thing, but the left should have seen this payback coming.
$C: This is fuckered and creepy but this shit is common in all media, Reddit for example is owned by a media conglomerate that stacks political rhetoric on all of it's subsidiaries as "must air".

Further more it seems PBS and John Oliver only give a shit because moderates and conservatives are involved in this, the argument is that people expect local news to be more trustworthy therefore conservative opinions shouldn't be shared on them, That's sort of nutty though isn't it, all of the national news-media companies, save fox news, owned are owned by liberal democrats who blatantly ran propaganda and lies through our last presidential election, that is incontrovertible fact mind you; they regularly misquoted or took Trump out of context, they almost never criticized Hillary Clinton for past behavior and de-platformed people like Dr. Drew who had a show with CNN at the time because he asked questions about Hillary Clinton's health, intentionally deceived the public about the size of the rallies of all major political candidates and most damning censored the protests at the DNC over the antidemocratic theft of the nomination from Bernie Sanders. 

CNN's ownership, time warner, banned RT news just ahead of the primary election season not because anyone anticipated Russian meddling but because they had consistently been reporting on things these other broadcast companies had been intentionally ignoring. RT had the most comprehensive coverage of the revolution in Ukraine and the civil war this conflict was started by foreign powers to overthrow the ukraine government, A Russian puppet state, through contrived protests which were paid for by people who wanted to ween Europe off of RU oil and get them to buy from elsewhere. eventually the protests became trendy and it was undeniable that the government was Russia's puppet, the protests escalated rapidly and the government's excessive use of force meant they had lost public support in much of the country. RT covered all of this honestly when the civil war began the tried to stay as neutral as possible and yes they aired info from Russian broadcast department their coverage in the US remained impartial.

I'm not holding up RT as a shining beacon of journalism I'm making clear that all sides use propaganda against civilians to skew their judgment and world view and that reducing the number of liars doesn't help one bit, un-coordinated lies are how detectives and investigators find new leads and uncover the truth. Unless we come up with a magic spell that makes these liars tell the truth the worst thing we could do is move toward giving on group of propagandists a monopoly on political speech that is how every fascist regime came about and unified yellow journalism of the same sort is how we've manufactured consent for almost every american war, from Iraq to the Spanish American war.

The take away from this post should primarily be this question: **Who wanted me to know this, and why?**

That one question is how you can defeat organized liars.

$C: This is just one instance in one day. How many more are there...
$C: Great turnaround in the comments here: besides the top comment the other comments emphasize NOT watching news AT ALL or killing the sentence 'dangerous to our democracy' by repeating it over and over. 

Yes, it IS dangerous to our democracy and repeating it, does NOT making it a dead saying.
$C: "You know, he'll read anything you put on the teleprompter.."
$C: This is beyond fucked. Fuck these reporters as well for supporting this shit.
$C: That repeat really sends it home
$C: Great, now the word democracy sounds weird.

$C: What fucks me up is that I trusted my local news station a lot. You know? 
$C: Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you prof that the news is even more of an echo chamber than Reddit is. 
$C: This video is straight up haunting. 
$C: Inb4 this thread gets deleted 
$C: Rupert Murdoch, I’m coming for you....
$C: All I can do in the face of this is laugh hysterically in order to not blow my own head off 
$C: Funny stuff. Good thing nobody watches local broadcast news anyway. Long gone are they days of unbiased journalism. Nobody will pay for it, so it was replaced. Now everything we hear or see has been filtered through many hands. 
$C: Now that's what you call a nightmare
$C: Fuck all these people.

Every single reporter in this video who doesn't step up and speak out  against Sinclair is a traitor to this country and is "extremely dangerous to our democracy."


$C: the birth a meme. such a beautiful sight

$C: Is it just me or are their words not matching up to their lips in several shots?
$C: This is Modern Art
$C: Does America have a public broadcaster like the BBC? Or are all the news outlets owned by corporate interests?
$C: Wow. I'm left speechless...Seriously, how do you respond to this...OMG!
$C: Sinclair is fucking terrifying.
$C: This is some super creepy hypocrisy here. 
$C: Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu..ck
$C: i don't watch news, and this is why. i like to form my own opinions on things.
$C: That is some dystopian shit. Never been so viscerally clear how threatening media consolidation is.. this is extremely dangerous to our Democracy.
$C: You can see the pained look in the eyes of a few of them. They know what they're doing is shitty, but a paycheck's a paycheck.
$C: This went from funny to scary really fast.
$C: Universal suffrage is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: I'm shocked that one of them isn't blinking I'm being detained, send help.
$C: Saint Clair . But if we speak up and keep speaking up we can make a change. They would like you to think you don't stand a chance so you'll stay silent. Speak up, organize. Fight the 1%, our only true enemies.

$C: Well im definitely glad cable news viewership is going down
$C: This is nightmare material 
$C: This is why I only trust Facebook with my news. [/EndSarcasm]

$C: My local news channel is in that video. Fuck.

Hi Jean!
$C: Well that was disturbing.
$C: This is very, very alarming 
$C: this is creepy, but at least i agree with the message

kinda hypocritical of them to say it though haha
$C: “Local” TV news has been garbage for some time. All the same type of anchors, stories, editing and enunciation. It honestly needs to just go away. It hasn’t been relevant for 25 years. 
$C: Capitalism baby. Learn to love it. Pretty ironic how Orwell invisioned the state as being the villain when now it's actually the corporations holding so much power. 
$C: One of my local news stations was in that clip. Not surprised and the last time I watch them.
$C: https://youtu.be/vhKY9x9zz3Y

$C: Oopsie boopsie somboody made a fucky wucky

$C: Just so people know, same thing happens in radio, except there are websites you can buy the radio bits from. 

If you have ever listened to a radio show in North America with prank calls (illegal), dumb games, stories that have nothing to do with local community it was all bought and paid for. Clearchannel to Iheartradio, they all used it, on all major stations. Even ESPN radio does. 

The old O and A radio show used to call people out on this all the time. 
$C: Wow this is crazy
$C: Ted Turner said he started CNN because local news is bullshit. Now we have proof. 
$C: this is extremely dangerous to your democracy
$C: https://youtu.be/GvtNyOzGogc
$C: There are literally dozens of us!!
$C: Yikes...
$C: Guys, this is...fuck.
$C: Seems like the Patriots' plan has gone pretty well.
$C: Ironic because "this is extremely dangerous to our democracy" is pretty accurate... exceptt its about them...
$C: Good thing this level of brainwashing couldn't happen here..r-right guys?
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy 
$C: We aren't in a democracy. It's disturbing how many people think that's what ut is.

Oh, and this video is creepy. 
$C: This makes me physically ill.
$C: This is utterly terrifying... Who the hell do you even believe anymore??
$C: Ya this needs to go viral...
$C: I wonder if these anchors are aware that this is going on while they’re saying it lol. Would be really awkward to have that job. 
$C: Now „democracy“ sounds like a stupid word to say. Happens everytime. 
$C: Fucking *talking heads*.
$C: I didn’t see KDFW in there! Fox DFW(Dallas Fort Worth) doesn’t play into their BS. 
$C: 

as always.... paranoid and projecting their own actions onto others.

duh... what did they think was gonna happen with Sinclaire buying up local.  The downshot of this... local issues will not get traction AT ALL

I would have suggested offsetting it by a strong community facebook, but......
$C: Woops, one world order ya cunts? 
$C: this is why Russiagate is a joke. as if they needed to steal our elections xD
$C: There was one person of color in all of those anchors. 1/100
$C: Fuck Sinclair - they are the most insidious thing to happen to TV in quite a long time.  Local news has always been a bastion of local journalists reporting on local issues.  

Sinclair owns my local CBS affiliate... I saw one of their 'opinion' pieces last year trying to justify Tom Price's travel expenses by spending 5 minutes talking about Obama and the deep state.

Seriously - fuck these guys.
$C: Take out democracy and insert monopoly. 
$C: It's like a cult saying is not a cult. 
$C: This is one of the reasons I don’t watch the news on tv
$C: Is this Sinclair? It breaks my heart knowing they own ROH. 
$C: Isn’t the other half also owned by one company?
$C: 1984 ladies and gentlemen 
$C: Wow way to make a point that was an eye opener and someone or some heads are going to role for making the fake news so obvious.

I bet those people are going to feel really pathetic right now, who in there right mind will take any of them serious from now on.
$C: Wow. Disgusting. 
$C: wait..... false news being spread by ignore, non-fact checking social media members IS dangerous to our democracy. Thats how trump got elected. why are people bashing the message here?
$C: This is some Black Mirror shit right here. 

Except it isn’t. It’s our reality, and it’s kinda disturbing. 
$C: To the front page!
$C: This is terrifying. 
$C: Can someone explain to me why there are so many TV news channels? 

I'm pretty sure my country doesn't have that many. 
$C: EXACTLY why I don't watch the "news"﻿
$C: More disturbing than expected
$C: Jesus this is extremely dangerous to our democracy

$C: Damn, the phrase "This is extremely dangerous to our democracy" sounds so uncanny/horrifying on local broadcast news. 
$C: No puppet!
$C: This rustled my jimmies 
$C: Whoa. This is really eerie and Orwellian. 
$C: This is why the only new anchor I trust is Morbo, may death come swiftly to his enemies. 
$C: I used to travel a lot for work, and was bothered by how you could hardly tell you were in a different city unless you remembered traveling to it. We used to use the pejorative Cookie Cutter to mock the visuals.

Now it seems that even behind the eyes, we're all factory made as well.
$C: This is a weird black mirror episode
$C: Holy shit. We're fucked. 
$C: Oh no, not you too Dave Gonzales.
$C: "Don't trust news that isn't from us"
$C: One black guy and one black woman in the mix. I hope neither's name is Token. 

$C: Holy shit, ABC7 is my local ABC affiliate.
$C: Jesus. Welcome to the new now, it has arrived. 
$C: This is beyond disturbing. These people probably don’t even realise they are part of the manipulation. 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy ^^^Comrade
$C: This was on our local news in Redding CA. Word for word the exact same statement
$C: Just wow
$C: Next time my parents say I know nothing of the world because I don't watch news on TV, I'll show them this.
$C: Reminds me of the spliced together threat video put together by the hackers in *Live Free or Die Hard*.
$C: I am HowToBasic.
$C: Look how sad the newscaster to the right looks in the thumbnail. She really feels how dangerous this is to our democracy.
$C: Jeez it’s scary seeing my local news station on reddit 
$C: IT'S LIKE THEIR PARENT COMPANY PUT OUT A STATEMENT TO MAKE ALL OF THEIR STATIONS TO SAY THIS WORD FOR WORD...
$C: Fucking hell saw one of my local channels on there, gross gross gross
$C: We are the borg. 
$C: Well that was horrifying
$C: But is it dangerous to our democracy?
$C: Thanks Ajit!
$C: *Plays National Anthem Sadly*
$C: Join us. Join us. Join us.
$C: 1984
$C: Is this Last Week Tonight? Seems like it would be an “And Now This” segment. Paging John Oliver. 
$C: Just goes to show you how incredibly dangerous mainstream news is these days. The ironic part is they claim to not be biased, right before bashing other news sources
$C: It's crazy how they all have the same parallel thinking!
$C: I find this extremely dangerous to our democracy...
$C: ALMOST unbelievable.
$C: Wham 13 is on that video no surprise there 
$C: We really do need some sort of media reform. It's getting ridiculous. I'm 100% for freedom of press, and having a select few companies in control of the majority of media outlets infringes on that, and it is very scary. We really do have a "fake news" problem in the country.
$C: lol, god damn America you are so totally and completely fucked
$C: Incredibly disturbing
$C: Well, that's disturbing and ironic
$C: We are the Borg. Resistance is futile.
$C: It wasn't until one came up that I realised there were hardly back people on there. Is that a thing in America or is it just that company or am I missing something haha
$C: I’m guessing Sinclair are the proud owners?
$C: And what will we do about it?
$C: Doublespeak
$C: I thought i was watching a new episode of black mirror
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: I completely agree. Fox News is a danger to our democracy 
$C: This is really messed up.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to your democracy.
$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyenRCJ_4Ww
$C:  wow this is pretty powerful stuff.  
$C: Damnit Rochester at 1:15 
$C: That was far more disturbing than I anticipated....I also find myself suddenly more concerned about things that are dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Just a glitch in the Matrix.
$C: 'We are the Borg.'

An interesting parallel there. All the formerly independent stations being swallowed up by several larger corporations for the supposed greater good.
$C: I didn't even know companies could own media outlets. This was disturbing 
$C: Wow, this has to be a joke. Scary stuff and scary times we live in.
$C: That female anchor’s concerned face in the thumbnail. 
$C: Pushing a platform that is against exactly what it is that they are, in fact, doing themselves. Bizarre.

I wonder if any if those ~~journalists~~ cue card readers have watched that video...
$C: I love Big Brother.

$C: Mods please sticky this post. 
$C: The monks have always been here.
$C: THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO OUR DEMOCRACY.

DID YOU GET THAT?
$C: Wow, I'm thinking we need a new amendment to the constitution that prevents corporate control of local media. I don't know how it would be worded, but something needs to be done to protect the first amendment. 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Pay no mind to the troll behind the curtain...
$C: Holy fuck
$C: Found the deep state media. Funny how it resides in the right wing media outlets. 

Fox News is for tinfoil trumptard loons

And CBS News is for old people. Aka old white republicans. 

Keep them scared and stupid. Swallow that propaganda sheep. 
$C: We are the Borg.
$C: Non-American here. Can someone sum up who Sinclair group and what is their agenda?
$C: that's fucked up shit
$C: This is really dangerous to our democracy!
$C: Well, shit.
$C: Fuk

$C: Exactly How dangerous to our democracy is this again??
$C: Scariest damn movie I've seen all year.
$C: So wait, you’re telling me if I bought every local news station out I can control the news completely?
$C: This is why net neutrality is one of the very few issues in our modern time which is worth shedding blood over. If we lose this now we wont get it back. 
$C: I wonder what it would look like if the same thing was done for Reddit comments.
$C: The biggest threat America has is conservatism.
$C: The revolution will not be televised.  
$C: Now define what “our democracy” is.
$C: What blows my mind is how some of Reddit does not seem to understand how this scales upwards on the national level. The news is not here to inform us. Thing of very single narrative out there, you are being played.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to OUR democracy.
$C: WHAT ARE YOU DOING AMERICA.

Love Canada
$C: This genuinely scares me.
$C: The irony.. I wonder if the newscasters even see it, or they just turn a blind eye to it
$C: "One of us, one of us..."
$C: This is the face of the enemy.
$C: **THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO OUR DEMOCRACY**


*Passes torch around the hooded circle*
$C: I’m worried I may be a Russian bot. Help! 
$C: This posts gonna be on  the top on all for a while.
$C: This video is going places, and it deserves to. 
$C: Sinclair does this with radio stations too. They own 630 AM in DC. They have run must run ads for years a out how Nancy Pelosi had a stroke and is senile and that this leads her to slur her speech. 

Fucking assholes.
$C: Jesus christ thats horrifying in a weird way
$C: This is one post on T_D I have up-voted.  
$C: This is disturbing. Maybe Infowars was right. These lemmings want to create a new world order.
$C: This is fucking horrific
$C: Holy shit even my local news stations did the exact same thing 
$C: THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO OUR DEMOCRACY 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy 
$C: Can't up vote this enough. 
$C: brainwashed americans. Thinking they know everything 
$C: What the actual fuck
$C: It's probably just a crazy coincidence.
$C: This is why I only get my news at the best source. A ranting hobo with a cardboard sign.
$C: http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/going_to_die_indiana_jones.gif
$C: Fox and CNN sharing the same script eh?

Illusion of choice. 
$C: Que miedo
$C: They picked an apt quote to describe what they’re portraying, that’s for sure.
$C: Let’s give Deadspin some praise, it’s their video.


$C: Democracy has its flaws. People get their vote, but if they aren't educated in voting then it's easy to manipulate the system. I bet the same TV stations abusing the system are the ones telling the voters that it's a fool proof and "free" system.
$C: Thanks for the nightmares
$C: Capitalism's tendency towards monopoly is one of the reasons why it's incompatible with true democracy. 
$C: Was that Linda McMahon?
$C: Dude this is some Goebbels level shit right here
$C: I see what you did there.
$C: And just think, there are centrist liberals who will say, "let's hear them out.  Give them a voice.  Let's not be worse than them by calling them directly on their bullshit"
$C: These pretzels are making me thirsty
$C: Jesus Christ, this needs to be pinned to the top of the front page! Amazing work OP!
$C: russian bots!!!! ... uh... wait... bots.. oh
$C: "You're not going to get any true confessions out of me, I'm a Leo, and our thing is changing the subject."
- Ira Levin, The Stepford Wives 

$C: >This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.

And that's how they accidentally created the strongest rallying cry for their opponents.  Nothing like directly quoting the entity you're protesting, on your sign.
$C: This is why I have never seen the point of news anchors. They have no real value other than to read whatever is put in front of them. A useless, soulless profession. 
$C: "Resistance is futile..."
$C: Props to the editor. Scary stuff.
$C: The word democracy doesn't even sound real anymore.
$C: This is fucking insane. It legit looks like the intro for a post-apocalyptic dystopian whatever the fuck videogame. 
$C: Sinclair Media Group was pretty much Fox news media version 2.0 this is an example of how Trump got elected!
$C: Chilling! Warning to anyone on some psychedelic trip, be it cannibis or LSD, please do not watch this. I'm sober and this is freaking terrifying. I could imagine what it would feel like while high. Man, such a dream-like dystopian *what the fudge!* moment in time. Am I overreacting? Anyway, peace and love and all that jazz.

Edit: spelling
$C: when you know for sure that your job makes you a corporate tool
$C: Whoever did this, did a great service to our democracy.  Respect.
$C: They look like mix of fox, cnn and MSNBC channels. They are different companies so how can there script be similar? 
$C: These pretzels are making me thirsty.
$C: I can't understand a lick of what anyone's saying. It's impossible to tell even with everyone saying the same thing. 
$C: My town got a shout out at 0:07. El Paso-Las Cruces communities. I've actually spoken to her. Really nice
$C: Tools

$C: why is the thread removed?
$C: Ugh, if something doesn't happen soon, we are going to be the next Nazi Germany. All the tinder is ready, all its going to take is some one to lite the match.

$C: Good lord. This reminds me why I don't watch the news. 
$C: Also, doesn't fox have one of the worst track records when it comes to "fake news"? I remember reading about it.
$C: It’s the Russians 
$C: what just happened? all the upvotes are gone and the video is marked stolen...
$C: So which company owns these stations?
$C: Stolen video???????
$C: And people think you're a tinfoil hat wearer when you point out that MSM is fake news too. There is no way that their strings aren't being pulled too. Dancing Marionettes. 
$C: I feel like one of the most important points may have ended up being completely incomprehensible, making the hypocrisy slightly less apparent.  Does anyone have a transcript of the section from around 40 seconds in?
$C: And they say Infinity War is the greatest crossover to happen in our lifetimes.
$C: If you consider that America's favourite sport has literally 1 hour of commercial time, 2 hours of cameras pointing at the crowd, coaches, replays, irrelevant stats and only 10 minutes of something happening then you cannot be surprised by this.

The media dictates everything in the United States. 

$C: I spotted my local news in this. 
$C: Any idea why the thread was just removed?? Too political for r/videos?
$C: This is gonna blow up, mark my words
$C: I've saw somewhat similar videos but not this well put together. Great job. It still instills physical disgust in me. This is propaganda. Literally mind control. When are we going to snap out of it and do something about it?
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy....

Not what they're talking about....

Just... them...
$C: This video is extremely dangerous to our democracy 
$C: News in not about news; it is about entertainment.  

I interned at a local news station writing 15 second "topicals" (those annoying adds than run all day claiming to have important information about your taxes or crime) and most of the stories were canned with stock footage.  I would organize the canned video, and I would write some lines with "local flavor" for the on air talent, but they were all generic and had little or nothing to do with your town.  Even if you see local video, the script may be almost pre-written and the same story is aired all over the nation.  Local news is not all about local events/news; I did a thesis paper that showed stations aired the same number of Crimes, Accidents, Disasters (CAD) each night, and they would go outside of their designated Nielsen ratings area to get them.  So your news is formatted like any other entertainment show to fit a formula, but hey they all end with some kind of happy story at the end. 

I don't watch the news, and maybe we should support more journalistic based news organizations instead of "if it bleeds it leads" attention grabbing, but not really informative news sources.   
$C: The most ambitious crossover event in history
$C: It's extremely what to our who?
$C: The ending of the video was perfect.
$C: Satire really is dead. 

Time to rewatch “Network”
$C: Only a few companies own everything. Look at Disney and what they own, they're able to push any agenda these companies want, after all if you heard it on the news it must be true...
$C: I m sorry what was it that’s dangerous? Didn’t catch that.
$C: Now i dont feel bad for ignoring the news.
$C: Ive been waiting to mention this. My father-in-law will watch one channel during the day but in the evenings he goes to KTUL - Tulsa’s Ch8 “news.”

At the end of the main portion they air a segment called “Bottom Line With Boris.” If it doesn’t sound propagandy or Russian operativey enough just from the name, the whole purpose and content of the segment is this fucking tool talking down to viewers telling them what to think about the Trump news of the day. Seriously, it’s just him pretending to wring the “truth” from all the “misleading national mainstream” news outlets. It is STRAIGHT UP STATE-RUN PROPAGANDA and I finally had it one evening and called him out on it to my father-in-law who isn’t even a Trump supporter. He doesn’t respond, but continues to watch that station as far as I know. This should be extremely alarming to all Americans. 

Sinclair is a threat and VERY DANGEROUS TO OUR DEMOCRACY. 
$C: What can I do to put a stop to this frightening BS?
$C: I hate this for a couple of reasons:

1, and most importantly: It’s scary as fuck!

2: Sinclair also owns Ring of Honor Wrestling, a company that I have been a fan of and supported since it launched in 2002, long before Sinclair took it over. The company itself has nothing to do with politics or anything like that, and if you were to watch the product, you wouldn’t know it’s a Sinclair thing unless you paid attention to the graphic on the screen at the end of shows, but I do hate where the money goes when I pay for their shows/merchandise.
$C: It’s called propaganda! People fall for this all the time. I’m glad this video was made
$C: I love the internet
$C: IIRC a lot of media corporations (i.e. Murdoch's) operate on a financial loss on the surface level. 
The real profit comes from the sheer power associated with being able to influence public opinion on such a massive scale. 
$C: On one hand, I feel bad for the newscasters, because for a lot of them they just have a job and they do this to pay bills. On the other hand, I hate their"news voice."
$C: smh the discussion got WAY 2 REAL to be kept on reddit

oh it got unremoved
$C: r/conspiracy
$C: "We are the Borg. Your biological and technological distinctiveness will be added to our own. Resistance is futile."
$C: This is how Neo must have felt, when Constructor showed him those multiple TV screens, to explain him what the Matrix actually is.
$C: This vid needs distribution 
$C: *May you live in interesting times*

...a curse indeed.
$C: They’ve become so lazy as to not even bother switching it up from station to station. Boldly so. 


If I was running a media propaganda engine that large I’d at least do it a bit more discretely.
$C: What the actual fuck
$C: This is what is referred to as Project Mocking Bird. It's pretty much what Conspiracy Theorist have been warning people about for the longest time. Conan O' Brian also did a segment about this... TWICE. They pulled the rug right from beneath our feet. Comply sheep!
$C: My local news, owned by this company, has a terrorist alert segment. Random siren effects go off and they begin talking about incidents around the world. The rest of the news is not like that. Just that segment. 
$C: More recently, Sinclair pushed a must-run segment featuring former Trump adviser Sebastian Gorka complaining about the existence of the so-called “Deep State,” and unelected group of government officials who are supposedly manipulating policy and controlling the public narrative. The segment was reportedly produced by Sinclair national correspondent Kristine Frazao, who previously worked at Russian state-run media outlet RT.
$C: Remember that you should pay for your news not for your media. 
$C: haha nice one
$C: Funny how you can’t share this to any social media other than reddit
$C: Which black mirror episode is this? 
$C: Sorry if this is a really dumb question, it might be because I'm not American or because I don't understand a lot about...business...things:

How can the Sinclair group own local Fox News and NBC stations, without owning Fox or NBC? Do they own the local stations and 'rent' the right to use their names/content franchise-style?
$C: We should do something about this. 

_For the greater good.._
$C: I don't get what is so bad about this video 
$C: we are borg
$C: "Go back to sleep America"
$C: Reminds me when jon stewart used to do a similar thing by editing together news clips like that to show how they all read the same scripts with the same buzzwords and they werent stations owned by all the same company
$C: This needs to be shared everywhere. No exceptions. People need to realize the lies they're being fed
$C: I live in this city and Jessica Headly is a babe.  Too bad she is employed by fox.

$C: This is very scary
$C: These pretzels, are making me thirsty! 
$C: This is straight up some 1984 shit.
$C: The United States is not dying. We’re dead.
$C: This is very creepy the way the video is edited. 
$C: The irony of this is astounding and deeply disturbing.
$C: This is one of the most dystopian fucked up things I have ever seen.

Quick, someone throw a wrench at the screen! 
$C: This is fucking terrifying!!!
$C: Yeah. Pretty much done watching news, panels, round-tables with regards to politics. Just speeches, interviews, discussions, and debates. After that I can make my own mind.
$C: It's truly sickening when you see your own local news station in this lineup.
$C: I felt like I was watching something from Mr. Robot
$C: Okay, someone should get an award for that effective editing.
$C: These brezels are making me thirsty.
$C: See more like this in this documentary exposing media and political handshaking.

$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Wow this is insane
$C: democracy
$C: I’m concerned about the troubling trend of irresponsible, one sided news stories plaguing our country.
$C: Thats not creepy at all. 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our Democracy
$C: Holy shit this is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: Hey guys I think this is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: Sounds like it's extremely dangerous to their monopoly
$C: That crooked-mouth liz lemon lookin bitch at 1:17....
$C: You're looking at a bunch of 'local' news broadcasters who are owned by the same company - the only ones shown here are ABC and FOX. 

Information is still out there to those who are willing to pursue it - that is the foundation of actual democracy. 
$C: Black Mirror...
$C: Local television news is designed to scare you, support your local sports and tell you the weather. 
$C: Fuck that was fucking weird !!!!who owns this stations?
$C: Yes, it's very dangerous for ~~monopolies~~ ~~plutocracies~~ ~~theocracies~~ democracies when there is an open forum for the public to speak their mind and influence the thinking of others in the public without total governmental or corporate oversight. 
$C: It's too late isn't it...
$C: it looks like the scene where the protagonist just realices what has been going on like in the movies. 

its disturbing. it was a suberb editing job 
$C: Conan’s been doing a bit on this for years. Basically a lot of news stations have “filler” pieces that have a general script uploaded by one guy on a cloud server and are given permission to use it to fill airtime. 

It’s not malicious but more the work of a careless or lazy producer. The show still needs to air by 6 p.m., their programs can’t run short. 
$C: And the cult followers at the_bigot always talk about fake news. 
This far right company pushing the same story out to people like propaganda. 
I bet they start reporting that President started a wall, even though it’s a fence in calexico. Just to keep his hillbilly bigots happy. 

$C: People payed to tell you independent journalism an individual reporting is untrustworthy while all using the same script.  

Is it 1984 yet?
$C: Yes there is a huge problem with biased news and publishing stories without checking facts. Thanks for telling on yourselves. Please do better in the future. 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democrazy! 
$C: Ayyyy America. More problems than most third world countries
$C: How is there 20k likes on this post and only 11k views on the video. The video should be trending already. 
$C: ???

$C: Fuck, that hypocrisy was deafening.

$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: This seems like something that V would have made in V for Vendetta
$C: GOOD JOB
$C: Is this extremely dangerous for our democracy?
$C: goodbye, democracy!

$C: Could’ve been taken from a Black Mirror episode. Scary. 
$C: Did not John Oliver do a piece on this? 
$C: This is fucking nauseating. 
$C: OMG BIG BOTHER IS WATCHING US ALL
$C: Very nice job.  Great example of how some conspiracies are straight up fact. 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: One word: Drones. 
$C: Not always. This is what happens and they don't care about doing a good job. 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Nobody who needs to see this will see this
$C: Ah, this is on my news right now in Pensacola. Yikes. 
$C: It's funny because these words mean nothing to me..
$C: I feel like this is extremely dangerous to our democracy 
$C: The saddest part is that the people that this targets will believe that all this "biased" coverage is a vast conspiracy...without a shred of understanding that the big conspiracy is being played out on them.
$C: This is fucking incredible. And terrifying.
$C: Stupid fucking puppets. That's all the news is. Whoever owns and runs the news channels is probably as corrupt as a politician and bought off. Special interests bullshit. 

I stopped watching the news but sometimes think that's also what they want. 
$C: Reminded me of ole' Billy Mays
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SFmM5CWnmtE
$C: This is almost satire proof...
$C: Sinclair is indeed doing some very creepy shit right now. Our local paper has been reporting on it (excerpt below) and fortunately people have been reacting very negatively.

>If the script sounds like something that could have come from the White House, there’s a reason for that.

>Sinclair, which controls 173 TV stations around the country, is owned by a politically conservative family that strongly supports Donald Trump. Unlike other media companies, Sinclair requires its stations to broadcast political content generated by its corporate headquarters as part of their news shows.
$C: Hey yall wanna hear a joke?

USA is a democracy!


$C: What is it now like 6 Major Media companies produce just about all news in America or something like that? 

Hell Disney alone owns 40% of the total Media in America 
$C: Good on you OP, for putting this together. 
$C: Holy fuck. This has so many other implications...
$C: Dozens? Try again...
$C: We are borg, resistance is futile.
$C: Ah yes 'biasness'
$C: I've never saved a post before.
$C: How do you stop a company like this?
$C: It’s almost like it is a national campaign brought to you by some kind of national broadcasters association... or something.
$C: So it seems that none of these local reporting news sources think that they themselves could be a culprit of pushing fake news. 

Hmm...

fake news inception.
$C: Holy gods. Show this to everyone you know.
$C: Damn
$C: Me, reddit-boy, big smart. Me immune to propamaganda. Big news people say bad thing!! Me, news learn from reddit.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy 
$C: Is this really so different from newspapers all running the same article from the AP?
$C: Wow that’s crazy 
$C: Fuckin dystopian 
$C: But what message were they even trying to push? Mistrust for news sources?
$C: Here's Mark Dice talking about it.... [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KZjxjlI4x8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KZjxjlI4x8)
$C: "Democracy" sounds really weird now
$C: >you’re not watching us and this is extremely dangerous to our business 

Here I translated it to English for everyone 
$C: 1:27 Look out! A black guy!
$C: Mindcontrol
$C: Kill it with fire!!
$C: This is why I don't feel bad about watching the news anymore.

You have to actively read different sources, read between the lines, and fucking **work** to find out what's really going on.
$C: Post Ajit Pai you can expect to find only more and more fake news channels like these ones
$C: I don’t want to live in the Matrix!

/sobbing
$C: Only watch Fox News for the newswomen upskirt and nip shots, watch every news cast 
$C: The text deconstructs itself.
$C: If this doesn’t scare you, I don’t know what will. 
$C: The real question is why youtube does not take down these kinds of videos? 
$C: Holy shit. I feel like I’m watching some sci-fi movie on Netflix. Nope, real life... 
$C: Can someone  explain to me what’s wrong with multiple news stations talking about fake news?
$C: That gave me a tummy ache :(
$C: "In April 2017, Sinclair announced it had hired Boris Epshteyn, who was briefly the White House assistant communications director for surrogate operations for the Trump administration, and a senior advisor of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, as chief political analyst.[153] Mr. Epshteyn was born in Moscow, Soviet Union and emigrated to the United States as a child.[154] All Sinclair stations are required to air Mr. Ephsteyn's commentary nine times per week. [155]"

"Headquartered in Hunt Valley, Maryland, the company is the largest television station operator in the United States by number of stations, and largest by total coverage; owning and/or operating a total of 193 stations across the country (233 after all currently proposed sales are approved) in over 100 markets (covering 40% of American households)"
$C: This is why I don’t watch the news
$C: How can these people stand themselves? I can’t fathom living a life mouthing someone else’s words. What a terrible and empty existence.
$C: This is so filthy lmao amazing OC
$C: Well this is terrifying.
$C: Is the woman on the right in the thumbnail just realizing her boobs are a foot apart?
$C: Well. There goes my relationship with local news. 
$C: "This is extremely dangerous to our democracy."

Well they got one thing right.
$C: All of those broadcasters are complicit in crimes against humanity and should be killed. Don't give me "I have to feed my family". That's the "I'm just doing my job" of the Nazi's excuse in the 1940s. 

Fuck all of them. 
$C: At least the lady at 1:18 uniquely says it out of the side of her head. 
$C: Fake news?
$C: Lmao not WTOV 9 I grew up watching this since we didn’t have cable or satellite since we lived in the middle of no where USA 😂
$C: I didnt know this. I havent actually watched tv in going on four years and didnt know how much fox or any other media company for that matter, controlled. This is actually scary.
$C: Just goes to show that no one should trust the media
$C: Didn’t see Missoula’s :( I know employees who were told do it or leave.
$C: Yes, Sinclair IS extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: This needs to go viral, on Facebook. Can someone make this go viral please? Thank you.
$C: What's more surprising is that people are still surprised by this. 
$C: Wow. Just wow. At least take 5 minutes to change the script slightly, geez.
$C: This could pass as the beginning - or end - of a Rage against the machine video 
$C: Democracy with only 2 political parties? 
$C: This is one of the few things I feel necessary to share to Facebook..
$C: This is incredibly made. Kudos.
$C: I saw this same reel on my local new station and thought it was a legitimate show of good faith. I've been bamboozled. No more WPTV for me
$C: Incredible. Wow. News are hard to come by these days. 
$C: Holy shit we’re beyond the pale here
$C: *Mid Michigan news* 

Hey Im from there! Glad to know my state is as fucked as everyone else.
$C: I was like, wow, who would do that? And then I saw News 9 pop up (my local news station) and I was like, oh. Sinclair.
$C: NA MEDIA OMEGALUL
$C: Damn america is realy sniffing its own ass
$C: Looks like someone's peeking an eye open at the world.
$C: We are borg

$C: What exactly is Sinclair trying to accomplish here?
$C: Just from the screen shot of the video, the lady on the right has the “concerned news anchor” furrowing of the eyebrows. Like she has the attitude of, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but your grandma passed away, first let’s hear from Brian at the county fair grounds for the local cat show. 
$C: Video gets removed for "politics" at the behest of Reddit's advertisers in 3... 2...
$C: They should do a black mirror episode of this
$C: Like the queen on English tv. Fuck you guys, you changed the channel... I am still here 
$C: Joshua won on points. 
$C: This heavily reminds me of that Channel 5 News Bo Burnham song
$C: /r/greatawakening 
$C: > I get it. I do. You're an individualist. Rugged individualism. 
It simply doesn't work anymore. Brands. Sure. A useful heuristic. But ultimately, everything is all systems interlaced, a single product manufactured by a single company for a single global market. 

> Spicy, medium, or chunky. They get a choice, of course. Of course! But they are buying salsa.

$C: damn when they all speak is dissonant unison it hits hard
$C: Electronic

$C: Does anyone have a direct link to this video?
$C: Someone needs to hit you all in the mouth.

$C: One copywriter to rule them all
$C: You are free to do as we tell you.  WAKE UP SHEEPLE!
$C: Alright folks. Post this shit to Facebook for all the dipshits to see. (those who still have fb) 
$C: Non-American here. What is this about? Like what are those news people referring to? Looks like a response to something recent. Is it about Cambridge Analytica? 
$C: Please keep upvoting this reddit.
$C: No this is a tide ad
$C: “You have fake news”

These guys: “no u”
$C: We must realize these news outlets pander to the older folks. So don't let it get to you too much. Times will change just like they always do. There is hope. 
$C: TURN OFF THE DAMN TELEVISION.
$C: That one black dude was looking fly as hell tho
$C: This post should be stickied to the top of this sub 
$C: I'm  going back to print media.  
$C: /r/aboringdystopia

$C: Wait one minute!  Who let that black guy in?
$C: This is some V for Vendetta shit right here.   
$C: Imagine the type of people who watch TV news. Old people, right? Then imagine the type of people who vote. Also old people. 

Starting to make sense? 
$C: The intent is to give you a sense of danger of in our democracy for unlocking certain location locked channels
$C: 17k views and 35k up votes? 
$C: Woah!!!
$C: At least 3 of these stations are in my state. COOL.

EDIT: Ran on all 4 stations owned in Pa. Harrisburg, Altoona, Pittsburgh and Scranton.

$C: Is this a very meta April Fools’ Day Prank?
$C: Video has 17k views. Post has 35k upvotes. How.
$C: Money out of politics is the way out. Demand public financing of elections, with  matching funds, and a max $200 on donations. This way leaders have to appeal to the majority, the poor and middle class to get the money they need, and don't spend half  their workday fundraising like they do now.  Let's say they give a town hall. If I like them, I donate $100, they get say $400 matching from the fed. Their priorities would change fast. Fuck this oligarchy. 
$C: We are the Borg, lower your shields and surrender your ships ... 
$C: Thank you for this. Lol
$C: Head On. Apply directly to the forehead.
$C: Can't lie to us any more, you would be kings.

And we are coming for you.
$C: 20,000 views on YT so far
$C: The “This is extremely dangers ..” part looks like a reel of bad audition tapes.
$C: So where do we go from here? Fake news plagues the internet and media conglomerates own all our news outlets. Do we rely on word of mouth and Snapchat videos of people who were there when "X" happened? Crowd sourcing the news?
$C: What's frightening is that this doesn't even include all of the stations that ran this script. My local station wasn't in the compilation, and I saw this run word-for-word last night. 
$C: Wow, that is terrifying
$C: Go Capitalism!
$C: This is goddamn mental.
$C: Now I understand why 1984 is a banned book. MSM is a joke.
$C: They aren't wrong...
$C: My life became so much more positive when I stopped watching daily news
$C: **Seattle Market:**

- **KOMO4**  ABC and soon to be **Q13** Fox are Sinclair owned networks.

AVOID and stop watching. If you still want to watch ABC or FOX programming, you can do it via Hulu. 
$C: The only surprising thing here is that the company still operates the local stations. The assumption way back when these buying sprees began, was that they wouldn't.
$C: you'll often see word for word news stories because they all draw from the same source, news wire services like the associated press. Many news channels use their content verbatim. 
$C: I mean... they're 100% correct.
$C: So like when do we get those cool blue coveralls?
$C: Freedom of free press... so buy the press 
$C: Wow i just finish zeitgeist and see this. Fuck
$C: My local news station is on this video. I went to school with the anchors daughter. 
$C: [Not sure if I believe you, Sinclair.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-B1sink-nY)
$C: Why are there so many news stations? Why not just have 2-3 that have a local news segment that cuts to your local news based on where you are? So strange.
$C: it’s treason then
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: They blatantly misuse the words "balanced" and "produces" considering their stations didn't produce this segment and their ownership is completely biased.
$C: To be fair this kind of thing is rampant in all journalism. 
$C: Post this video on the twitter , Facebook and any other social media of your local sinclair station
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stations_owned_or_operated_by_Sinclair_Broadcast_Group
$C: Here I am most annoyed that they said democracy and not republic.
$C: As a Brit, the notion that news reader are even allowed to say anything about anything being ‘dangerous’ or staring views as if they were facts is crazy. 
$C: Well... That's a very special case in the USA because you have local news. In other countries you just have one news for the entire country on each channel. This boils down to pretty much the same just with different faces.
$C: "can I copy your homework?"

"sure but change it a bit so it wont be obvious you copied"

"..."
$C: Someone do one with late night comedians!
$C: lol that's why I don't watch tv and haven't watched the news in 4+ years. Ive never regretted it or looked back since
$C: Scariest fucking movie of my life. 
$C: I wait for the day when people wake up and not only decide they've had enough, not only realize the depth of the situation, but realize walking in the street holding hands and singing kumbaya isn't going to help the situation. 
$C: Democracy is a funny word 
$C: I love seeing everyone’s own spin to the same thing 
$C: Is this really that surprising?
$C: This was grotesque 
$C: Welp, bout to go to the Nosleep and Black Tapes podcasts to listen to stuff that's not as scary. 
$C: I have not seen a true "news" station in more than 20 years. Opinion is not news. Editorializing is not news. Any organization that uses the term "abundance of safety"  is not a news organization.
  Can't believe people still watch this junk. 
$C: Whoa 
$C: Disturbing, it made realize just how weird the word democracy is.
$C: Dystopian.
$C: I’m Ron Burgundy?
$C: r/conspiracy
$C: They’re right. All of them are extremely dangerous to our communities. 
$C: The most absurd part is that people think biased sources are just as bad as ones that post objectively false information.
$C: I never watch the news anymore. The world is alot more peacefull without it  
$C: Reminds me of Hot Fuzz... 



In unison now 


*For the greater good*
$C: If they haven't got drinking problems then they've buried their souls with demons effectively. 
$C: Does anyone under 40 even watch local or national news?  I don't.
$C: You can easily identify the ones who had diction classes and who are able to put intonation on the correct syllables. 

(diction is the word we use in french, might not be the correct one in this context)
$C: holy fuck
$C: for the peace in the kingdom
$C: It’s not a fucking democracy it’s a constitutional republic.
$C: I’m Ron Burgundy?

$C: When real life becomes Black Mirror
$C: Ryan Wolf is a piece of shit, he used to work here in the RGV in Texas at Channel 4 and my camera buddy told me everyone hated his guts. He's also like 5'3''
$C: I think "dozens" is a vast understatement for the Sinclair Group.
$C: Look at all these puppets here to fool the masses. 
$C: This honestly explains a lot......

The only reason this doesn’t scare me more is because today’s youth does not watch tv.  Local news is in their death throws. This is why there is such a gap between the young and old. But it won’t work. They’re too close to death to steal it back for long.
$C: This is so well done
$C: half of them look like they're fucking smiling when they say "extremely dangerous to our democracy"
$C: We lost. In the past, people died for nothing because we are a chicken feared shit. Just kill them all
$C: why dont they just have one person say it? 

$C: Exactly why I don’t watch the news 
$C: Democracy doesn’t sound like a real word after hearing it that many times... 
$C: I feel like when this happens in other countries it’s horrible, but when it happens in The US it’s dismissed more as funny than actually horrifying. 

Time to wake up and realize that the US (and the Western countries) are very guilty of “fake news”, spying, influencing with false info etc. Just as much as ‘the big bad’ countries like Russia. 


$C: Democracy no longer sounds like a word
$C: But, we aren't a democracy... 
$C: Can someone provide a link?
$C: [Is It Time For Dogs To Have A Social Network Of Their Own?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZElSajQdOo)

$C: In some countries it is illegal for news outlets to share any opinions on any matters. They are only allowed to report the What, When, and Where of the story. It was once this way in America, but unfettered democracy became too dangerous to the powers that be. 
$C: I wonder if this stuff goes on in British television?
$C: wasn’t me
$C: This cannot be shared enough.  Deep State / Clinton Cash BS - Sinclair is actually doing it.
$C: "This is extremely dangerous to our democracy"

So the one time they don't lie is actually the scariest thing.
$C: I wonder how these cunts working there feel like when they see this video. How can you sleep at night day after day knowing you are a cunt working for cunts spreading nothing but shit every day. These people are the downfall of democracy, everything starts with media since they have an unbelievable amount of influence on the average joe.
$C: It’s like they are using themselves as examples of the point they are trying to make.


Also, I don’t watch the new much. I never realized until now that there is a news anchor tone. It’s kinda slow, with slight pitch changes, and kinda sounds like they are trying to explain a complicated task to an extremely slow person.  
$C: they live, we sleep
$C: Wow
$C: What can you do with 7 Reddit gold that you can’t do with 1 Reddit gold?  
$C: This has been happening for years with the American mainstream media. See: Democrat Media Complex. 
$C: Who the fuck actually gets their 'news' from privatized media and television in general?

**edit** It's a rhetorical question. I pretty much already know the answer. 
$C: #STICK TO THE SCRIPT
$C: Press f to pay respects 
$C: Pin this one. 
$C: THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO OUR DEMOCRACY! 
$C: #Matrix Theme Plays
$C: Don Henley would be proud!
$C: I already know how this ends.
$C: I'm way too late to comment on this but does anyone have a devil's advocate opinion on this? My local news paper will have the same AP or ruters article as the next town over. But it is cited. My small town doesn't have an Iran expert journalist for example and they pick up arcles from them instead. Is this an example of that or a different beast we now see?
$C: Saving for later, ignore this
$C: Talking heads at their finest. Keep an open mind, think for yourself. 
$C: Is anyone surprised that a pro-Trump media group is trying to bash manufactured/scripted/misleading news by spreading their own manufactured/scripted/misleading news? These people specialize in projection. 
$C: How come the upvotes are rn 45 K and views on the video are just 18k ? Can someone explain me this?

-Thanks

$C: It felt like I was watching a fake news story from a movie and then I realized it wasn't...
$C: I got chills when I saw my local channel.
$C: We have 4 stations in Columbus. These fuckers own 2 of them.
$C: This is the same exact thing John Stewert pointed out on the Daily Show, repeatedly. It was a main segment pretty much every single episode. Like, I knew how the video was going to play out before I clicked it and expected to see comments referring to The Daily Show. How is this so shocking and unexpected still? 
$C: Jesus christ this is disturbing. I feel like this is an intro for a movie about a post apocalypse where there's some great puppet master in the background... Oh wait, that's just the USA right now. 
$C: Jesus i wish i could write with the level of irony this country outputs daily.
$C: I was here.
$C: But I can trust my local news, I watch them on the telescreen in the ministry of truth
$C: I'm going to get downvoted into hell, but I hope people contextualize this with the recent hit job the media has done on Facebook (and other social media websites).  Social media is an existential threat to the media's business model.  Recently, Facebook took further steps to reduce the amount of news on their site (further damaging traditional media outlets).  Result?  Coordinated, similar, misinformed attack on social networks.  In this video alone we see the media, in unison, pointing the finger at social media as the bad guy.  Well... isn't that some shit.
$C: Are these people fucking idiots? Think for yourselves..
$C: Thank you for doing this. 
$C: I am going to use this when I tell people to stop watching TV news. It amazes me people watch that garbage
$C: This is creepy AF, but I'm not exactly certain as to why...
$C: How long will companies like this last?  I have not watched local news in over 10 years, even then it was on in the background... with many people having Netflix, Amazon, etc. it seems like the ratings for these have to be dropping slowly.
$C: [Corporate monopoly] is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Is there going to be a time in our future when we are responsible for our own media? I mean, I probably still have my susceptibilities, but my first reaction on ANY news article is 'ok, whats that angle?'

Followed up with 

"How much do they care about that click"

"Are they selling something"

and "should I be weary" (hint: YES)

We are news cuckolds. I don't mean this in a t_d sort of way. I mean this is a "oh, the news media fucks us and then we slurp up the cum and we enjoy it" sort of way.

Fuck everything about this. Trust nobody. Always question everything, particularly when you are going to lick up their cum.
$C: It doesn’t look like anything to me. 
$C: [Last Week Tonight's segment on the Sinclair group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvtNyOzGogc)
$C: well this is scary
$C: *This* is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: THIS kind of stuff is exactly why I'm immediately suspicious of anything I hear on the news. This kind of machine could manufacture and distribute just about any truth it wants. Terrifying, and worthy of intense public scrutiny. 
$C: Something fucky is going on with Reddit. Ten minutes ago, this video was the top of my front page, with 34.5k views. Now it has 47.9k views and is no longer in the top 100 on my page. The other link just like it, which was #3 on the front page, is also missing in action. This link is only two hours old at this time. What the fuck is happening?
$C: Ahhhh I love a good demarkacy
$C: I am so disappointed it didn't end with Ron Burgandy saying "this is extremely dangerous to our democracy?" 
$C: I thought of crossposting this to r/InterdimensionalCable, but mostly because I wish this wasn't from our dimension.
$C: Great editing, but what's the BFD? Is it extremely dangerous to our democracy?
$C: Always distrustful toward MSM.  Knew there was a reason.  
$C: I see my local news there

$C: They are the true danger to our democracy. One of many reasons I don't watch TV anymore.
$C: This video scrubbed from r/all by deleting and reinstating it. 
$C: Say it ain't so Frank Coletta 
$C: We should get this trending on twitter. @ your local reps. 
$C: Alright. 100 bucks says someone is already mixing the *"This is Extremely Dangerous to our Democracy live in Ibiza 2018 party remix."*
$C: *Fake news*
$C: Yup. I knew El Paso was going to make the cut. I forgot about it last week and both news stations had the same stories. 😡
$C: If you see your local news station in this video, post it onto their social media pages!
$C: I saw this on my TV station and thought holy shit! 1984 much. 
$C: One of the creepiest things I've ever seen actually.. Christ
$C: 50k Reddit upvotes, 18k vid watches.... 
$C: That fucking chilling to watch.
$C: We need a snippet of this to be in a full feature film about the Fox News conspiracy. Maybe the film will even make it on the news. Then we’ll have a sequel...
$C: That was amazing
$C: I like what [Brzezinski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfrLkqsEuog) said last year.
$C: Well that's pretty fucking creepy.
$C: Outfoxed
$C: Brainwashing material, It's almost extremely dangerous to our society.
$C: That's disgusting
$C: This is terrifying.
$C: Can someone please tell me how democracy in the USA can survive Sinclair (the company that owns these stations), brainwashing their viewers? 


Any politician that acts to curb their power will have all these stations spewing messaging against them/for their opponents.


$C: WTF America? You guys are on the slippery slope, and someone's oiled the fuck out of it.
$C: Scary, so scary that they all seem robotic, like they're stripped of their free will.
$C: Jesus. this is 30x worse than any 80s horror movie.

I'm really going to log off and hid under my proverbial rock 
$C: This the most haunting thing I've ever seen.

$C: woah it's almost like scripts exist for anything that is televised?
$C: I'm just waiting for the "This is extremely dangerous for our democracy" autotune rap battle. 
$C: The video has 18k views, yet this post has 60k+ upvotes already (by the time I commented this). Is YouTube broken?
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our efficiency
$C: I reccomend everybody check out this documentary,
Manufacturing Comsent: Noam Chomsky and the Media- https://youtu.be/AnrBQEAM3rE
$C: This is so well done!
$C: What a joke! 
$C: This is why I don’t watch cable news anymore. It’s all propaganda. Yes even the cable news show that you like and are sure is honest is propaganda.
$C: put on these glasses!!!
$C: This can't be a good thing!
$C: Ok the word democracy started to sound really weird by the end of the clip. 
$C: Lmfao. News reporters blink repeatedly to make it seem like that they are not reading it off a teleprompter.
$C: Bias agenda extremely dangerous to our democracy. Hm. They don't even see the hypocrisy.
$C: 4/10. The creator of this video didn't have a clear thesis statement.
$C: I hope that clip goes viral or it will be extremely dangerous to this democracy.
$C: **and this is extremely to our democracy**!!!
$C: Reminds me of the first lady’s speech at the thing in Cleveland word for word it was Michele’s speech she read!
$C: moms spaghetti 
$C: Wow. This feels just like the housing bubble crash. We can all see the lunacy, but we can't find a way to do anything but participate until it burns down around us. 
$C: That was scary
$C: What a bunch of douchebag tools.  
$C: Al Jazeera English on YouTube.
$C: This is pretty creepy, but how dangerous could this possibly be to our democracy?
$C: Fuuuuuuuuuck!
$C: Somebody repost this to r/blackmirror STAT!
$C: This is like some black mirror shit
$C: I think this is dangerous for our democracy
$C: They load the clip in, omnicolor

And then play it again and again and again

Buyin all the products that they're sellin ya

They say, "Jump" and ya say, "How high?"

Ya brain-dead! Ya gotta fuckin' bullet in ya head!
$C: Bakersfield kbax58 and cbs29 is on the list.  Sad.  Guess I will not be watching those stations.  
$C: Who the fuck thought this would work?
$C: Who still watches cable news
$C: Can someone explain what’s happening here? Couldn’t understand a thing.
$C: The thing that scare me the most is the people that didn't know this was a thing or it wasn't "this bad".
$C: Am I watching Mr. Robot?
$C: One thing is crystal clear. Sinclair is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: This just left the front page.

Um.. what?

$C: This is precisely why I own guns.
$C: This is fucking insane if you play the same video in different tabs. 
$C: Holy crap even some of the camera switches are the same. 
$C: I'm really not sure I get it.... Is it... good?... for our democracy?
$C: This is extremely dangerous for our Republic. 
$C: Fun fact- the term “fake news” began to trend as the pizzagate scandal was beginning to blow up
$C: Were we “supposed” to find this?
$C: Is this extremely dangerous to our democracy?
$C: I haven’t posted to Facebook in a while.  Feel like this would be perfect for that crowd, but I’ll also feel like somewhat of an asshole at the same time...
$C: They said "Wall Street" wrong, as Democracy. 
$C: :(
$C: one company owning dozens?? lol, a handful of companies own HUNDREDS
$C: "Cut the tall trees"

"Cut the tall trees now" 
$C: Huh, how about that, fake news. 
$C: Sorry I'm late, I heard this was extremely dangerous to our Democracy...
$C: #scary
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy 
$C: Now I my head all I hear is Pink Floyd singing “welcome to the machine” 
$C: Now democracy sounds  weird, what does that even mean. 
$C: Overlord newsspeak
$C: I am legitimately scared
$C: I've narrowed down my TV news intake to WGN.
$C: #J E S U S C H R I S T 
$C: Somebody put this pot on a lower heat!!
$C: With videos like this how can one even argue that mainstream media is “fake news”? There was every company in this video from fox to abc. It’s all garbage. 
$C: IMHO, this isn’t near as bad as when a political party passes on “talking points” to newscasters willing to spread that party’s propaganda. We don’t do anything about them (well, we attack the Republican supporters), but why should we penalize these newscasters?
$C: Wonder who deregulated the media so 6 companies can own all the stations? (It was not the republicans)
$C: This is really creepy 
$C: Fucking frightening.
$C: Congratulations. 
$C: Oh man, that was disturbing
$C: That made me pretty anxious, what the fuck 
$C: Wow. 
$C: Ah, there’s CBS 6, I was waiting for them to show up.

And of course it’s fuckin Liz Bishop.
$C: Now the word democracy sounds weird to me. 
$C: These pretzels are making me thirsty.
$C: Kimminities
$C: *Ironic*
$C: If you’re gonna make the claim that you’re independent and fact based at least don’t disseminate the same talking points word for word to your media outlets. 
$C: Anyone have numbers on the amount of millennials who even watch this shit? I know it's a problem but my hope is baby boomers will die and this sort of thing will stop. 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our minds
$C: The thing I found interesting is that its not only one type of affiliate station. Some of these were Fox stations, some NBC, CBS, and ABC stations. 
$C: This video is extremely dangerous to Fox News
$C: Fuuuuuckin' hell, that was surreal.
$C: This is like the real life Kent Brockman. “I for one welcome our new alien overlords”. Fuck Sinclair 
$C: These pretzels are making me thirsty 
$C: Holy shit
$C: I find it horrifying that our leadership on both sides of the aisle seem to be totally cool with a single entity owning sooo many news outlets.
$C: Wow, fucking pathetic.
$C: What happens is we all sit here with our hands on our genitals and continue to do nothing and be dumbasses.  

Straight out of a bad/scary movie from 20 years ago.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: I WILL NEVER WATCH KATU AGAIN
$C: It’s happening.
$C: Hail Hydra!... seriously though, this is disturbing.
$C: The greater good 
$C: Now we know who they are.  Time to launch an offensive strike.  Fuck you Sinclair. 
$C: 1:29 Oh no! They got a brother! Get out!
$C: As a member of "the media" I find this very disturbing.  Corporate agendas should never interfere with journalistic integrity. It is important to remember that not all outlets fall under this umbrella.  This is goes to show just how important it is for corporate leaders to have journalistic values.  

Also, this segment from Jon Oliver is pretty damn fantastic. He explains Sinclair in much depth.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvtNyOzGogc


$C: THIS is extremely dangerous to our democracy.

Fuck sinclair. 
$C: Wait what? Rewind that. What is it to our democracy? 
$C: So, which company owns all these news media outlets?
$C: fuck sinclair
$C: We are the borg.
$C: So when do we start the riots
$C: Wow, this is like watching the beginning of some dystopian movie...

What a creepy and scary world we live in, this video brings out the true picture of world news as it is...damn
$C: Holy crap, how is this possible
$C: Scary 
$C: That is creepy af
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our Democracy. 
$C: This is fucking terrifying.
$C: "These pretzels are salty"

$C: https://represent.us

$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: I don't think they know what the word "democracy" even means
$C: So who's side are they on? Obviously not Trump's.
$C: What democracy?
$C: This is the result of the fcc lifting its limits on how many stations a corporation can own.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.  

I'm gonna let KATV 7 (my local ABC affiliate) know they are pond scum.  
$C: [deleted]
$C: Fucking terrifying, I got chills watching this.
$C: https://www.npr.org/stations/
$C: I was watching my local news when they said this statement as well.. damn
$C: # John Oliver, where are you????
$C: That is disturbing. 
$C: Wut the fuck 
$C:  Creepy 
$C: What's with American TV and everyone looking like wax dolls? 
$C: r/democracy_criticizes_democracy. I will now go into meditation.
$C: At least I won’t waste 2 seconds reading all the unbiased comments.
$C: This on the heels of hearing about the FCC also disconnecting poor people from the internet? Holy shit, the GOP base will grow by leaps and bounds by maintaining all these local news sources and then limiting areas to only them.
$C: They aren't journalists anymore: they are just good looking people reading stuff.
$C: We are the Borg. We will add your biological and technological distinctivness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. Resitence is futile.﻿



$C: Anyone remember in X2 when Jean Grey could hear the minds of everyone around her? That's what it felt like watching this video. A million voices at once and I'm screaming MAKE IT STOP!
$C: This made me feel like I am in a episode of Blackmirror.

Disturbing.
$C: Do they even realize what they are a part of. 
$C: This is terrifying 
$C: This was the greatest video ever. Bunch of hypocrites.
$C: oh no, corporate media is extremely dangerous to our democracy? 

Oh phew, the sinclair group wasn't saying that.
$C: Double ungood.
$C: Someone please save to re-upload in case this  disappears magically.
$C: Paging r/drama - this was on top of my Home feed on iOS. After a refresh or two it disappeared from Home while many old posts were still there, in fact the entire rest of the feed was the same sans this post. The Popular algorithm still has it on top. What gives?
$C: Please consider these are employees that HAD to read what was sent to each station, and each station HAD to air it. Hate on Sinclair but remember these are just people trying to keep their jobs. 
$C: This! This pisses me off! 

“Don’t piss me off...Slapnuts!”

                                        -JJ
$C: Jesus fucking Christ. Dystopian as fuck 
$C: This isn’t some Orwellian satire any more. Wow this is an extremely effective clip. Wonder if this can get enough traction - this needs to be talked about 
$C: It's okay, they'll package and sell us a resistance we can feel good about.
$C: f s o c i e t y 
$C: This feels like a scene out of 1986
$C: I have fists that kill cyborgs. Give me the locations...
$C: Question: Will this be extremely dangerous to our democracy?
$C: If you don't watch news regularly and turn it on this is how THEY ALL SOUND!
$C: I am not even from your fucking country and I have CHILLS!!!!! 
$C: As a soon to be journalist, this scares the fuck outta me. 
$C: Fuck Ryan Wolfe!
$C: This is beautiful 
$C: So what do we do about this
$C: Only 9300 upvotes on YouTube. Please do everyone a favor and upvote this on YT. 
$C: This really bothered me more than i expected it would. It reminds me of outer limits. For the next hour, sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear.
$C: Damn I like eyewitness news...
$C: 1984? Never heard of it. Why do you ask?
$C: MAKE PROPAGANDA ILLEGAL AGAIN!!!

NO FREE THOUGHT = NO FREEDOM
$C: Jesus... scary shit
$C: I think Trump talks about this with regards to Fake News 
$C: Yikes
$C: “Machine men with machine minds and machine hearts.”
$C: Put the blinders on people, after Easter Sunday we all have to go back to work.
$C: Relevant John Oliver breakdown of Sinclair's bullshit... https://youtu.be/GvtNyOzGogc
$C: This video is the most important video to share on social media. This not being the biggest viral video of the decade decide where our country goes.
$C: This is fucking scary
$C: Well, there not wrong ..so....
$C: https://youtu.be/HFvT_qEZJf8
$C: Great editing. It pushes a mood. Eerie. I feel owned. 
$C: Shut up and smile. Shut up and smile.
$C: But wait, isn’t their warning good though? Watch out for fake news.
$C: Oh hey cool the station I work at is in here. Yeah Sinclair is quite.. a thing

$C: https://imgur.com/a/ZVhbY
$C: Wooo! El Paso!🎉🎉
$C: Wait I'm confused, what is this to our democracy again?
$C: This is extremely frightening!!
$C: The best part is this is required to run during every broadcast including other stories which are opinion pieces but run as real news. 
$C: At least what they are reporting is factually true. I'd be more concerned if it included falsehoods.
$C: I feel like I need to take a shower.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I don't have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. It's a depression. Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job. The dollar buys a nickel's worth. Banks are going bust. Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter. Punks are running wild in the street and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there's no end to it. We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat, and we sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be.
We know things are bad — worse than bad. They're crazy. It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out anymore. We sit in the house, and slowly the world we are living in is getting smaller, and all we say is: 'Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone.'
Well, I'm not gonna leave you alone. I want you to get MAD! I don't want you to protest. I don't want you to riot — I don't want you to write to your congressman, because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write. I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street. All I know is that first you've got to get mad. [shouting] You've got to say: 'I'm a human being, god-dammit! My life has value!'
So, I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window. Open it, and stick your head out, and yell: I'M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!
I want you to get up right now. Sit up. Go to your windows. Open them and stick your head out and yell - 'I'm as mad as hell and I'm not gonna take this anymore!' Things have got to change. But first, you've gotta get mad!...You've got to say, I'M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE! Then we'll figure out what to do about the depression and the inflation and the oil crisis. But first, get up out of your chairs, open the window, stick your head out, and yell, and say it: I'M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!
$C: I thought we were still years away from A.I.
$C: Scary they even have the same tone of voice
$C: Let’s eat the rich
$C: So... ... Who are they worried we'll hear from if they are all the same?
$C: me_irl when I use a generic coverletter for job applications but alter some words and sentences a bit.
$C: Woman on the right side of the thumbnail has the hardest resting bitch face I’ve ever seen .
$C: Now follow this idea through to the end from a neutral third party perspective. Is this a single phenomenon from a single company or par for the course from news outlets in general? Why just news outlets? How many people are complicit in agreeing to send this message? A few dozen? Hundreds? Thousands? How do they get all those people to agree to do that? Is this a single phenomenon or does it say something about these types of organizations, power, people in general. What does that mean? Why did someone make this video? Is this also propaganda? What's their goals? What does that mean to you? Why? What else? Lets see some follow through.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I get that this video is targeting Sinclair but aren't almost all tv news outlets fueled by big money from politically interested corporations on both sides?

Are there any tv news shows that aren't?
$C: I know this is an original and completely unique opinion, but I think that this is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: I think the US is a republic, not a democracy. I get the message, but in an autocratic republic, democracy doesn't really matter anymore, as evidence by the orange POTUS.
$C: Holy fuck
$C: So. Much. Gold.
$C: Did this just get pulled from the sub?  WTF its not on my front page anymore.
$C: The states are fucked in so many ways. Near the top of the list is the media. You can't watch any of it without walking away with someone else's opinion.
$C: This is exactly what news is now days 
$C: Who saw their local TV station? I know I did. 
$C: [Televisioooon, rules the natioooon.](https://youtu.be/PS_b6TthSGQ)
$C: Yes, yes it is. 
$C: Well that’s the single scariest thing I’ve seen in reality so far...add that to r 50/50 with a puppy on the other chance.
$C: This disappered from my front page almost as soon as I watched it.....
$C: does fox own nbc, abc and cbs? or is there another puppeteer hiding in the shadows?
$C: The integrity of journalism was compromised long ago, perhaps with the adoption of 24 hour news outlets - it doesn't really matter. They're right to state that the increasingly polarized spectrum of American politics *is* a threat to democracy but i'm loath to trust the rest of that dialogue without doing some fact checking. The unfortunate reality is that outrage culture sells; it also drives victimized demographics toward radicalization.

Thankfully, it feels like news television is on its death throes. The problem is that we haven't fostered within our population the skills needed to identify fallacious logic and personal cognitive biases. We've got an elaborate store of information - the greatest in the world - at our fingertips but it's useless if all it's used for is to reaffirm existing beliefs instead of challenging new ideas with the intent to discern truth.

---

It reminds me of a quote from Modest Mouse's "Missed the Boat".  

> "Oh, and we carried it all so well  
As if we got a new position  
Oh, and we owned all the tools ourselves  
But not the skills to make a shelf with  
Oh, what useless tools ourselves"

I don't have the solution. I'm certain it includes breaking up super PACs, killing FPTP, regulating regional monopolies, and redistributing wealth to improve social programs (e.g. education, healthcare).
$C: But... We're a republic...
$C: Maybe I am being a dumbass but can someone ELI5 as to why this is bad? Does it matter if they are all saying the same thing as long as they are conveying the same thing? The event has already happened... As long as they are not miscommunicating the events why should their points be docked off for using the same script?
$C: This needs to be posted in more places.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: Scary
$C: Fade me
$C: It's OK, they say right in their broadcast that they are "fair", why would anyone doubt them? /s
$C: Is this USSR?
$C: I hope sinclair gets a ton of blowback because of this
$C: Oh the irony 
$C: Uhhh... April fools...... right guys??
$C: Scary.
$C: This tripped me out a little, damn. 
$C: What's dangerous to our democracy?
$C: All wings report in
$C: Fucking wow. Fuck the media
$C: Media consolidation at work 
$C: I'm not even american an this is fucking scary.
$C: One comment said "oh hello 1984" and it wasn't wrong
$C: dimogrsy 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to your democracy.
$C: You can fall out of the basement!
$C: Fuuucking terrifying.
$C: upvote this till everyone fucking sees it
$C: “We are all Negan!”

Whooops, wrong show. 
$C: This is why I never turn on the news unless I need to follow live coverage of something. There’s just no reason to *watch* the news. Reading it is a whole other conundrum that you have to learn to sift through carefully and skeptically, but people who watch the news on tv are definitely going to be spoon fed propaganda and fear. 
$C: /r/ABoringDystopia 
$C: What Orwellian freak show are we living in?
$C: These pretzels are making me thirsty!
$C: why dont these newscaster refuse to be brainwashed and stop saying the same things?
$C: 12 gold and counting for this post, it's beautiful when quality content is recognized. Kind of ironic that they speak of "fake news".
$C: I love democracy 
$C: That gave me chills
$C: But let's go ahead and give them the benefit of the doubt and ridicule anyone who dares calls our mainstream media fake news.
$C: We have a sub for r/quityourbullshit but I think the entirety of Reddit is pretty good at that already
$C: The question is how many times have other unaffiliated news broadcast companies said that same quote...
$C: Just do what I do, cancel cable and don't watch the fucking news. It works great.
$C: Really unsettling.
$C: Reddit is my news feed!
$C: This is terrifying. And I’m sure it happens more often than we’re aware. 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: JESUS FUCKING CHRIST. 

THIS NIGHTMARE WILL NOT END.
$C: What can we do about this? Is this an FCC issue? An anti-trust/monopoly issue? Is there any way to combat this?
$C: Disgusting. Eat a bag of dicks you pathetic fucks. 
$C: OBEY
$C: I wonder if this is very dangerous for our democracy.
$C: >believing a single thing the MSM says...
$C: This is a great video, but how does Sinclair fit into the picture with other broadcasting groups such as FOX, ABC, CBS and NBC? They seem to be operating only at the local level, while the other broadcast giants are operating at a different level.

It's creepy, that's for damn sure, but I'm unsure of where Sinclair fits in among the giants.
$C: Democracy? With that script this seems like a monopoly happening before us. What democracy? Would they let us vote if it mattered? I doubt it, we vote yet politicians still steal our money from Bills and projects that money was allocated for. This isn't a democracy anymore, was it ever truly? This country was founded and built from slavery, and stolen from the indigenous people they slaughtered for the land we saw them as using "incorrectly". 
$C: Say Hebbo! to Tarvuism. This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: They even got the brother in there! 
$C: You can't handle that on strong acid...
$C: Someone tell the FTC about it, they don't use reddit over there. The current industry structure is hurting consumers and not just competitors. https://www.ftc.gov/faq/consumer-protection/submit-consumer-complaint-ftc
$C: This is just like dog barks a million times
$C: You know when you repeat something so many times that it stops sounding like english?
$C: We are the Borg. You will be assimilated. Your culture will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile.
$C: FUCK.
$C: The further dumbing down of America. Sad that it comes just for the sake of profit for small groups of individuals
$C: Weird...  I don’t remember this episode of Black Mirror. 
$C: It's almost like there is a small group controlling our thoughts through the media.
$C: ITS THE BORG
$C: DANGEROUS TO OUR DEMOCRACY 
$C: Boom.
$C: Wow, we gotta get the news in the hands of the government, and fast! 
$C: Feels like a clip from Black Mirror, except it’s not at all.
$C: Amazing job 
$C: Local news is the worst. 
$C: It's so reassuring to see these news stations are on the same page and unite to stand against bias, false reporting, and all things dangerous to our democracy.
$C: I thought this was already well known in the US.
$C: This is bad shit, no matter what our political affiliation
$C: Great editing. Intense 
$C: Kind of scary... 🤔 
$C: THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO OUR DEMOCRACY HERE, COMIN’ TO YA *LIVE* ON QBBL RADIO *ALL SUMMER LONG*
$C: And this post and the video it links and any like it are part of what net neutrality would put a stop to ASAP. If it doesn't serve the core purpose of the money making conformity machine for the 1% take it down.
$C: Welcome to the modern state of "the media". Puppets engaging in wars with other puppets.
$C: I’m far too drunk to perceive this in a fashion that doesn’t make me feel sick 
$C: Hehe. Sounded like one dude said demarcacy.
$C: FARK!!!
$C: 9/10 needs explosions
$C: We are the Borg. Resistance is futile. You will be assimilated. 
$C: All your democracy are belong to us!
$C: this is extremely mind fucking 3am drunk at night 
$C: Wow that’s disturbing.
$C: It's crazy, I reposted this on my Facebook and the only person to comment was my mom. It's a non topic over there. 
$C: are we in a black mirror episode?
$C: I noticed this same thing with radio station banter in different cities when I travel
$C: This is like OJ Simpson saying that the court system is flawed. He’s not wrong, but he’s definitely not the right person to say those kinds of things
$C: Thanks Sinclair Broadcasting, John Oliver was right!
$C: Reminds me of “The Earth King has invited you to Lake Laogai” 

“This is extremely dangerous to our democracy”

$C: r/totallynotrobots
$C: #THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO OUR DEMOCRACY!!!!!!!!!!!
$C: r/KylieKole
$C: They are not wrong though
$C: /r/lastweektonight
$C: Are we now saying local news is fake news too?
$C: I don't think anyone has pointed out yet, but I think it's interesting to note that these videos come from affiliates of ABC...NBC...Fox...etc...etc...
$C: Damn, judging by the mod fuckery and the mass downvoting, I think this video hit some buttons.
$C: Now "democracy" doesn't sound like a real word
$C: This article is a pretty good timeline of the warnings about Sinclair Broadcasting and Ajit Pai’s aiding and abetting SB by easing FCC regulations that allowed it to take over Tribune. As well as his push to kill net neutrality and the Koch’s financial infusion to Meredith Media.   https://m.dailykos.com/stories/2017/11/27/1718754/-R-I-P-First-Amendment
$C: How do people see this and not instantly rethink *everything* they've learned from mainstream media?
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy 
$C: I hope the non Sinclair local affiliates run with this story.
$C: [Mind-blowing](https://quaestio.org/portfolio/spill-out/).
$C: Why would they write 24 scripts if they can all share the same lol
$C: There is a glitch in the Matrix. Apoc can you look for agents
$C: I wonder, Yes, I wonder if they understand what they are saying instead of just reading from a script.
$C: Tools
$C: Wow. Just... wow.
$C: what the fuck
$C: Wonder who made the mods pull their heads out of their collective asses
$C: Wow only 4 hours old and already nearly at 100k upvotes. This might be the first video on reddit to get reach 200k
$C: Damn Sinclair. The most dangerous company to our democracy!
$C: I hate when the term 'fake news' can be validated.
$C: One might almost think this is extremely dangerous to our democracy...
$C: Next Election better have Fairness Doctrine as an issue.
$C: I'm Spartacus.
$C: I am the SENATE.
$C: Holy shit. 
$C: Fucking Terrifying.
$C: Sketchyyyyyyy
$C: Fuuuuuuuuu7uuuuk
$C: Doesn't sound so local anymore...
$C: Fuck
$C: Starts to sound like Shodan at[ 0:40](https://youtu.be/hWLjYJ4BzvI?t=40s) 
$C: Democracy started to lose all meaning by the end. 
$C: Welll democracy no longer sounds like a real word
$C: How do I share this to Facebook? Not the actual link, but the full video? Is that a thing?
$C: This is scary as fuck


$C: The word democracy sounded so weird by the end.
$C: They are auditioning for Anchorman 3
$C: Inter dimensional cable
$C: Are all these people quoting something? What's the context?
$C: You guys think this is dangerous for our democracy?
$C: I posted this very idea last night. So glad someone actually did it!
$C: scary af
$C: Well... What the shit?
$C: Did any of these “newscasters” refuse to participate or quit? 

$C: !Remindme 1hour
$C: What in the fucking fuck. 
$C: I'm scared
$C: What a weird coincidence! /s
$C: When the whole class copies the same paper and only one kid even tried to put an extra word in.
$C: With the Associated Press it's very common for stations to receive similar if not identical stories and scripts.. is this not what we are seeing here? (I work/have worked in radio/local station broadcasting)
$C: Holy shit that is unnerving
$C: This is on another level lmao.
$C: Wow
$C: I mean this is a terrifying video, but at least we got a new meme out of it right guys? This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: These segments are formed differently than regular news segments. Does anyone know if they were prefaced as a pre-written statement or something before they went live?  Are they trying to portray it as a company wide statement, or as a personal message from the local news station (by not saying anything or otherwise)?

Edit: spelling n such
$C: [deleted]
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy 
$C: It's so creepy. 
$C: I watch this... and think man what an audition tape..
$C: We need to bring the fairness doctrine back and congress needs to break up Sinclair for antitrust. 
$C: >this is extremely dangerous to our democracy


Since the election has anybody else's town had a sudden influx of "churches" wrapping people's vehicles or otherwise stickering letters all over entire cars to shame the public sinners and demand you come learn about "Jesus god" or "daddy god"? Anyways
I think I'm gonna wrap my car with this quote
$C: Holy shit, this was scary to watch. I feel much more safer outside the US. 
$C: SUPER
$C: Last Week Tonight came early this week. Fuck Sinclair
$C: OK, I mean, I feel like fake news has always been around. We just called it a gossip or rumors.

To the extent that it's "dangerous to our democracy" I guess yeah, but it's not a new thing.


$C: Thats so freaky. This is the kind of thing i thought id only read from a book or see on a movie.
$C: People still watch the news?
$C: Now on frontpage from /r/television upvote that too

Edit: disappeared from front page again
$C: Manufacturing consent.
$C: I appreciate the effort that went into this.

It's also kinda terrifying how cult like this is
$C: *this* is extremely dangerous to our democracy

$C: Deeply disturbing. “Fake news” can’t be trusted but our ~~agenda~~ news can be trusted. Conformity training at its finest. 
$C: That awkward moment when your local news is on here..
(WRGB CBS 6 Albany with Liz Bishop)
$C: Argentine guy here... I thought our news people sucked. These people are just bad actors, horrible
$C: This. Is. Exploding. 1k+ a minute o.O
$C: Fucking burn that company to the ground.  Tar and feather the executives.
$C: This is really dangerous to our democracy 
$C: Noice. Caught them red handed.
$C: Some people don't care or see the problem with that.
$C: Conan O'Brien does a clip run down like this every once in awhile, petty eye opening.
$C: Thank you. 
$C: lol
$C: What episode of Black Mirror was this clip from?
$C: Reddit does the same:(
$C: /r/quityourbullshit
$C: Talk about pushing an agenda. 
$C: Holy fucking shit.
$C: I have a feeling that something is extremely dangerous to our democracy but I can't be sure what it is.
$C: Holy shit. Two seconds in and it's good old Ryan Wolf. That fucker used to be a local anchor where I lived until his ass moved to SA.
$C: This must be stopped 
$C: So many gold 😩😩😩👌👌👌
$C: Turn the TV off & never turn it on again.  That is the only answer.
$C: All i could hear was "We are the Borg. Your biological and technological distinctiveness will be added to our own. Resistance is futile."
$C: This is kinda creepy
$C: Like being spoon fed sugar cereal.  
$C: This is some MKULTRA level shit
$C: More like, de-MOCK-racy, amirite?
$C: So this is what a hive-mind sounds like.
$C: hahaha this is amazing!
$C: Whelp, time to burn it down. 
$C: Next Media Trend: in 2019-2020, get this...Print!
$C: By the end of it, “this is extremely dangerous to our democracy” sounded like a foreign language to me.

We can do it. We can protect ourselves from these 'puppets' and their masters.
$C: this is WHAT'S dangerous to our democracy..
$C: Fake news
$C: Hey guys i think this is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: What’s a dimahkrasee? It sounds weird when you hear it over and over. 

It just sounds like a mission statement. Lots of places have them. Like my fire department has one. Other fire departments have exact wordings. I’m sure there are many fire departments that have it, word for word, in many, many other departments. 
$C: Test
$C: So I get the jokes and all but what can we do to stop this from growing? How can we make a change and remove this biased propaganda? 
$C: His name was Robert Democracy.
$C: The one controlling the information controls the people.
$C: All your news are belong to us. 
$C: THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO OUR DEMOCRACY 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our demarcrocy
$C: This is quite creepy...
$C: FNORD
$C: Google instantly jumped to labeling this "Trump's War on the Media" 

Further digging this same hole.
$C: This is honestly scary...
$C: Trump's desire in censoring media plus  this whole shit reminds me of V for Vendetta. 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: remember, kids: don't _ever_ refer to a news anchor as a journalist until you can actually show they do any of the work.
$C: You have to wonder if this will all end like I Heart Radio.  In effect that is what they are doing, programming multiple stations from one office.  Perhaps it will be the same local anchors and exactly the same news, just in different blocks in markets where they own multiple stations.  Maybe in time the human androids will be replaced by real androids or CGI and you will have computer generated newsreaders.  Most of the crap you see on local news is syndicated, native advertising, or press releases from their advertisers.  It is pretty much here now, and with a station owning multiple outlets in a city they can sell it as "news on your schedule"  and have their anchors and staff just work a 8 hour on air shift spread over multiple channels.

Right now the local stations are making most of their money from fees the cable companies must pay to re-transmit their signal.  This is huge money, and every so often the local stations demands more and the cable system drops them for a few days, and then something is magically worked out and the local station is back on cable.

While I am not a cable fanboy I do not believe cable companies should have to pay a local station to put what is on the public airwaves and free to anyone with a TV.  But the cable companies are forced to put the local stations on their system by law, and the local stations behave like the cable company and charge quite a bit, and go up every time the agreement must be renegotiated.  It's kind of hard to negotiate when you have to have the product, so as usual the customer suffers.  Since people are dropping cable, the local stations have to get the same amount of money, they just simply increase the price per subscriber to make up for the subscriber losses.  

One would think if the cable companies have to put the local stations on their system, the price should also be set by regulation, and if you don't want the local stations you should be free to have them removed and pocket the savings.  

Now I'm guessing that if they ever dropped the "must carry" local stations on cable, you would see a similar situation that I Heart Radio found themselves in recently when they didn't have the money to cover the debts of all the radio stations they bought.

So I'm guessing the must carry will continue and the fees the local stations will keep going up and more people will cut the cable, or go to services where they can buy only what they want to watch, instead of having to pay for stations they don't watch, including the local stations that the vast majority could watch with an antenna.


$C: Getting news from multiple sources works.... until the same people own all the news sources.
$C: are webby's still a thing, cuz I'm nominating this
$C: These are the people who want to own your data, limit your speech, invade your privacy, and take away your right to fight back.... and according to them and their narrative, the Second Amendment was for hunting rights with muskets.
$C: Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is only slightly dangerous to our democracy right?
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our [demarcacy](https://youtu.be/hWLjYJ4BzvI?t=1m28s)
$C: Jesus..
$C: Wow.

$C: well that's bad
$C: Is it extremely dangerous to our democracy tho?
$C: I’m convinced we are now in the Matrix 
$C: Has pai been introduced into the Mueller investigation? 
$C: It’s like straight from a Black Mirror episode. 
$C: NOOOO!  My local Cincinnati CBS news channel 12!  WHYYY GODDDD, WHYYYYYYY!
$C: First I thought it was fake news, then after watching it a second time I realized this was extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: Ever hear that This American Life about the [city jingles?](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/520/no-place-like-home)
$C: Someone needs to get Tyrone and Rog to read this script out.
$C: This is why I get my news from reddit
$C: The word democracy started to lose all meaning towards the end...
$C: We are the Borg. You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile.
$C: Not surprised. Luckily msm is slowly dying, but they will not go down without a fight.
$C: “DeMarcracy”
$C: I don't know if I've ever seen a post gilded so many times. At least not in 5 hours
$C: Let's be honest, the "this is extremely dangerous to our democracy" academy award goes to the woman at 1:14. She nailed it. 
$C: When they order abit too much brainwashing for it to be effective LOL. Great video. Talk about what you are not allowed to talk about! Not in spite! But to test our freedom of speech! (This is important). 
$C: Whoa!!!
$C: We are The Borg. You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile.
$C: Agree with them.  This is extremely dangerous to a democracy.  Hope we get one someday.
$C: I'm HowToBasic!!!
$C: this belongs in the moma
$C: This is why I almost never watch the news...local or cable.  And by the way we don’t live in a “democracy” never have and never will. We live in a Constitutionional Republic.
$C: Jesus.Fucking.Christ that was disturbing. 
$C: Welp, at least RI made the list.  
$C: **Individual comments have been removed. If you'd like to leave a comment, please indicate which comment by selecting one of the three boxes.**

$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: The part where they all say "this is extremely dangerous to our democracy" is freaking terrifying. Something straight out of 1984.
$C: Wake up.  It's worse than you think.
$C: How do you get ALL of these local markets recordings? 
$C: ShitGOPsays:  Thus is just free press speaking a no spin open view of the world. Stop oppressing our free speech!!!  
$C: There's a glitch in the Matrix
$C: MFW Operation Mockingbird becomes common knowledge.  

Edit: This extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Don’t know why I feel like reading The Catcher in the Rye now...
$C: “democracy” doesn’t even sound like a word anymore 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: Something tells me this might be dangerous to our democracy...
$C: I don't like this. It reminds me of those scenes from Metal Gear Solid 2 and not in a good way.
$C: We are the channels. Lower your reasonable behavior and surrender your free thought. We will add your Facebook and Twitter posts to our own. Your outrage culture will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile.
$C: What the shit 
$C: BRING ME THE BREASTPLATE STRETCHER 
$C: So who actually owns these companies?
$C: This is some incredible editing that shows us all the extreme danger to our democracy.
$C: Lisa needs braces
$C: This disgusting and downright scary
$C: This shit ain't right.
$C: It's not about how truthful they're being, it's about how much they report it and with how much certainty.
$C: This is SERIOUSLY fucked up.
$C: Sad face
$C: Well this is terrifying.
$C: Michael scott - "WOW"
$C: Fucking brilliant post!
$C: So this is back up and comments allowed now. Even creepier.
$C: You didn't think the local news stations wrote their own copy, did you? 
$C: Are people just figuring this out?
$C: This is very suspicous hmmmm.....
$C: WE LIVE IN A REPUBLIC FART WADS 
$C: Fucking sheep where all fucking sheep!!!
$C: This is what happens when there are high barriers to entry into a market. Becuase licenses are needed for the airwaves, monopolies like these are able to form. The airwaves should be like the internet, not its service providers- another oligopolistic practice, but the content creators: diverse and capable of producing original content.
$C: This actually happens with many stories, every night, across companies. For instance, if there is a story the Associated Press has created, nearly all news stations have access to use it in their local broadcast, where they will use the script that comes with it.

That doesn’t excuse the disgusting stuff Sinclair is doing, but the optics of the video is something that happens every night across the country among all media conglomerates.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy 
$C: Androids are taking over the Earth
$C: Where that one long really informational comment that break down what it’s going on in the post? Usually these thread have at least on and it’s at the top but I don’t see it.
$C: I'm HowToBasic!
$C: No words 
$C: I LOVE GOOOOOOLD
$C: If it were any more blatant we'd just be watching hypnotoad..
$C: We are legion, for we are many
$C: Super ironic. I just finished watching 1984 and I see this on the top page. Good job Reddit for letting this stay. 
$C: Thank you!
$C: Oh and this is just the minor league version. Hello prime time! 
$C: whores, every last one of them
$C: The second to last guy was Frank Coletta! Go TurnToTen!
$C: After a while the word “democracy” started to sound weird. 
$C: Atleast they were spreading the truth.
$C: Oh, the irony
$C: 2+2=5
$C: Jesus. You were gilded 23 times. The fuck. 
$C: I feel uncomfortable
$C: 23 fucking Reddit golds?! How are these all gonna be distributed equally??
$C: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
$C: insane
$C: How dangerous is this to our democracy?
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: Holy shit, this is crazy.. and the most gold (23 at the moment) that I've ever seen given out for a single post
$C: This is legitimately disturbing.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our individuality
$C: But is it dangerous to our democracy? 
$C: We are extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Holllly shits
$C: Damn man, shit gave me chills.
$C: It’s like the opening sequence to a post apocalyptic movie.  Probably something about widespread social unrest.  Are we already living in that kind of world?  I suspect that we are.
$C: Semantic Satiation
$C: Creepy seeing our local station on this. 
$C: These idiots are the dangerous part.
$C: I kind of want to watch more of channel 2, just to see how out of wack they are. 
$C: They’re all saying to look out for fake news. Can someone explain the issue? 
$C: Wow amazing video
$C: source: https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/how-americas-largest-local-tv-owner-turned-its-news-anc-1824233490
$C: Can someone put up the raw feeds of each one? I want to put together a real side-by-side with subtitles
$C: ok but why was that lady's mouth diagonal?
$C: That is the most gold I have ever seen for a post.
$C: When it starts to be dangerous to our Republic, I'll get worried.  /s
$C: I will fucking destroy you. 
$C: Made my skin crawl listening to their monotone!!!!
$C: I especially liked the part when the one guy said "this is extremely dangerous to our democracy"
$C: OMG great job!
$C: Anyone else notice the guy who said "demarcrosy"?
$C: I'm gonna send this to my local news station....god damnit......
$C: >"This is extremely dangerous to our democracy."

[You're not wrong, Walter,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6BYzLIqKB8) but you're a part of the problem.
$C: It's like we all knew this to some degree, but at the end when it's all over lapped, it sounds like a machine. 
$C: Incredible post. 

I’ve never seen one with so many upvotes and golds in such a short amount of time. I’m eager to see how many it ends up with in total.

Amazing job OP 👍

Edit: holy shit it was gilded two more times just in the five minutes I’ve been here reading comments 
$C: This type of behavior is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: Why do people have this blind loyalty to their news source? So strange. 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: This
$C: really reminds me of the happy new year vid by Black Mirror https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjNhW2mR1lM

the line just keeps getting blurrier
$C: It's the truth we cannot bear to hear.

But, hear it and then speak it back for it is not yours to hold but yours to share.
$C: I kinda hope deep inside that this is a twisted April Fools' joke.
$C: You know that feeling where if you keep saying the same word to yourself over and over, it starts to sound funny to you, but then after a little more you just get numb to the word and you feel completely indifferent to it? I started to get that sensation during the "this is extremely dangerous to our democracy" part.  Now *that* is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: "This is extremely dangerous to our democracy"  

The goal is to spread fear of the "others".  Fear is a powerful emotion, it keeps viewers tuning in and buying into the bullshit they're fed, trusting their own deceivers more than their neighbors.  

Always be suspicious of people spreading divisions, there's lots of power in it.
$C: Journalism is dead. 
$C: I’m in love 
$C: here's the scoop folks.
there is no news division for network news.  they took it away years ago and blended the news in to the entertainment division.
this was the beginning of what we have now.
$C: Holy shit. A few at the end cracked me up though... most had the fake passion and pausing for effect but a few gave zero F’s. lol
$C: Fake news being accepted as fact is scary. But so many ‘news’ stations sending the same message... now that’s much scarier. News should be unbiased in every way possible. Sadly that’s not the case. The only ‘news’ I can seem to trust now is first hand accounts and well off scientific studies.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our Democracy.
$C: Chilling.

$C: Does anyone have the transcript of this?
$C: Demarcacy. 
$C: Extremely dangerous to what, I missed that?
$C: .

$C: THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO OUR MONOPOLY * 
$C: I wish I was smart enough to understand the subject here.
$C: You also have to be a. Linde woman or a brunette man to be a news anchor apparently 
$C: Okay, what do you all think? Who had the best delivery of "this is extremely dangerous to our democracy"?
$C: Scary
$C: I’m confused. I would understand if it was abc, cbs, maybe Bc if liberal bias. But what about fox? 
$C: Funny how it takes so obvious a slip-up for anyone to care about issues that's existence are unarguable. (Myself included, no superiority complex here.)
$C: Do people really not know this is a thing? It’s been happening for years 
$C: Should not have posted this so close to April Fools
$C: You could go to two stores, or just one 
$C: They tried Tokyo Rose for treason for less.  
$C: This is extremely dangerous to Our Democracy. This Is extremely Dangerous to our Democracy. this is Extremely dangerous To Our Democracy.
$C: 19, 19, 1984
$C: Due to possible changes in FCC rules, what happened to local radio stations in the mid 90's became corporate controlled and boring. This may happen to local news.  If you are a fan of local news and consider it interesting now???
$C: Imagine being in this video and having the lie of your profession drug or clearly in front of you... 
$C: Disgusting
$C: No sir, you are extremely dangerous to our democracy.
 
$C: That was weird and scary lol
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: this is fucking terrifying

$C: We are borg. You will be assimilated.
$C: This is not dozens. This is hundreds. And many of them in big towns with lots of viewing. 
$C: Woah
$C: Damn. 
$C: I think you mean about 200 stations.
$C: This is proof that the 'democracy' is thinning out
$C: Yeah but how does this affect our Democracy?
$C: Damn 36 golds... you are a legend.
$C: If there is any positive spin on this it's local news is a dying media and the biggest demographic that still watches it will be mostly dead in 20 years.
$C: This is xtricly dangerous to our democrazy, yes, democrazy!  DEMOCRAZY not DEMOCRACY
$C: THEY LIVE
$C: Fuuuuckk
$C: Thank you reddit for bringing this extreme danger of our democracy to my attention.
$C: semantic satiation... democracy no longer sounds like a real word to me.
$C: https://youtu.be/ECE27vtp4WU
$C: Reminder to support the [Congressional Antitrust Caucus](https://twitter.com/antitrustcaucus?lang=en) who's mission is to find solutions to problems just like this.
$C: Anyone else get the same creepy vibe in this video compared to the president speech video in die hard 4? I know it’s not the same script being read, but the way it’s edit it’s to produce the statement is so astoundingly eerie.
$C: Gilded 37 times?! Jesus Christ. 
$C: Oooooh I saw my local one in there shitttttt
$C: Sounds like an anonymous announcement 
$C:  The fuck!?
$C: What is this and why?
$C: So what would it take for a little group of people to start their own news station/paperwebsite. Just a little group of people with no big corporation behind, thats there to deliver the news just as it is
$C: I feel like posts like these will be a pro for all the facebook users moving to reddit. They won't be fed facebook bullshit, reddit bullshit tastes much better.
$C: Holy shit, that's a fuckload of reddit gold.
$C: Wow.
$C: Shit, that’s my home station
$C: Source please
$C: This is the voice of World Control

https://youtu.be/iRq7Muf6CKg?t=62
$C: But what is its effect on our democracy?
$C: I love democracy.
$C: Reddit just buried the story it had 142k thumbs up and its now gone.
$C: Wow. Well done presentation of an absurd and pathetic situation. 
$C: It's not every day that r/videos hosts the most disturbing video on Reddit for the day. But holy shit that was unsettling. 
$C: Why wasn't the last anchor Ron Burgundy? He will read anything on the teleprompter. 
$C: I could see the enslavement of their souls happening right before my eyes. And that they were selling out to keep a job and knew it. 
$C: I got pretty excited when I saw my local news station, then I realized I really shouldn't be. 
$C: [This sounds familiar.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyenRCJ_4Ww)
$C: Fake news is just a propaganda thing i shouldn't believe in, CNN told me so. 
$C: I’m not conflicting with this but I’d like to know more if Sinclair or other influence 
$C: Whoa
$C: Come on you just had to throw the black guy in saying the word democracy wrong 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Where is roddie roddie Piper and his sun glasses?
$C: I'm surprised the comments haven't been locked, or the video removed.

$C: Creepy
$C: Fucking terrifying
$C: Can someone explain what’s going on here? Not from the USA by the way
$C: Well that is just gross. What are we going to do about this Sinclair group?
$C: Demon, democracy, and demonstrate have the same root word.  To show, to luminate... like the luminous one, Lucifer.

$C: x42 gold that’s insane
$C: Wow 42 gold
$C: Eugene Oregon has this same message. CBS affiliate, Guess Ya can't trust that news source. So NBC, CBS, and FOX news aren't credible. Reddits news is all I got, 
$C: I wish A-shit pie would die of a haemorrhaging prostrate
$C: what's it dangerous too? 
$C: Is this extremely dangerous to our democracy?
$C: But is it extremely dangerous to our constitutional republic? Because im pretty sure thats what our country is governed by. 
$C: Don’t we have some group called Anonymous to do something about this? They’ve been pretty quiet about this stuff and it’s their bread and butter.
$C: Wow
$C: **42 GOLD** wtf Reddit 
$C: At this point it seems like we should just avoid news in general. I don't have cable and I don't think I've missed anything important locally at this point.
$C: This is a good video but how can you guys not know this is how things have been?
$C: Thank god my local news stations seem to be safe for now: https://youtu.be/sZSrI9LRjWc
$C: Why am I not even remotely shocked? 
$C: This is terrifying
$C: “this is extremely dangerous to our demarcacee”
$C: I’m amazed they were able to say that with a straight face

$C: It's like the Truman show movie. We are being g told what they want us to hear and think.

$C: This is extremely dangerous to my democracy *nowfuckingforeverengrainedinmybrain*
$C: Someone should shoop the whole thing so it looks like "They Live"
$C: I want to cash in on this golden karma cash cow ...

$C: Imma go out on a limb and say this is probably very dangerous to our democracy.
$C: I'm I only one thinking Seinfeld? https://youtu.be/DRaLpHoZA8E

$C: I’m just gonna start saying the last words before I do disgusting stuff. 

“This is extremely dangerous to our democracy...*blows a snot rocket*” 

“This is extremely dangerous to our democracy....*rips huge fart*”

“This is extremely dangerous to our democracy...*eats an Arby-Q”

Seriously though I thought it was BS when it was like 20’ screens. Then they played like 15 people saying the exact same shit. Creepy. 


$C: This is why I stopped watching the news over a year ago. 
$C: ABC, CBS, NBC, and FOX stations. hmmm
$C: Something something fake news 
$C: My allegiance is to the republic, to DEMOCRACY
$C: This is honestly terrifying. Definitely r/WTF content right there
$C: this is extremely dangerous to our democracy 
$C: Oh the irony...
$C: That was way scarier than o thought
$C: Remember when the Reddit hivemind ignored another hivemind like this when it was labeled "Fake News"?

:thinking:
$C: Good thing we don't live in a democracy
$C: Don't be a sheep and swallow everything you hear on the news.  Take the time to do some fact digging on your own or even use common sense.  It's only scary when you think about how many people are too lazy or gullible to accept whatever is shown on the dummy box.
$C: This makes me genuinely worried for the continued viability of American democracy.
$C: 43 GOLDS?!?!

Edit: 69?!?!

Congrats dude!
$C: This is unquestionably the most Orwellian thing I've ever fucking seen.
$C: This is kind of scary.
$C: But does anyone even watch ANY of these stations? I know I couldn't tell you which one is my "local" one...
$C: I want to see a parody by regular news anchors.   Saying the same thing in unison, but instead of saying a city name, and local news, they all just say America, and American democracy,  is in danger, and has been in danger for s long time.
$C: Thanks, now the word “democracy” sounds funny.
$C: Holy fuck. That's a lot of gold.
$C: So we know this stuff is happening. But what do we do about it? Protest? What is it we can seriously do to stop this? 
$C: the last guy knew.  he shakes his head :P
$C: So much GOLD in this thread!! 
$C: Wow just wow. 
$C: Soooooo creepy it makes you wonder how often this happens
$C: I just want to throw up.
$C: This is actually a pretty serious problem. Everybody should share this as much as possible to show how easily the news can deceive people. Everybody needs to see this please spread it around
$C: 43 gold. Damn.
$C: Where does America go from here? How do you come back from this?
$C: It I still had a Facebook, I’d share the hell out of this. 
$C: fuck 
$C: Jesus. 
$C: What the actual fuck
$C: Wow. I heard this exact same speech on my local news station and it made me feel a little bit secure. I was glad that they took it upon themselves to address this very pressing issue. This was very eye opening. It’s all a sham. Nothing is real. We are all sims in Sim City Buildit available now on apple iPhone and android devices. Damn... 
$C: Fucking RUSSIANS did it again!!
$C: Yea but Fox abc and CBS are all different companies. Or does some bigger company own all of them? I don’t get how this works
$C: What the actual fuck. This is disturbing as all hell. 
$C: One might say it's extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: And this is, extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: When the teacher says "Use your own words"
$C: That is fucking terrifying. 
$C: Ha ha.  Seems like this is one of those “ no way people are those stupid to catch this “ moments....    thank God for millennials.  
$C: Holy fucking orwell
$C: Turn off the god damn TV 
$C: Well, I guess if our world turns into a dystopian hellhole we’ll at least be rid of teen dystopian novels over-saturating the YA market.  
Because we’ll all be dead or enslaved.
$C: And the nation will eat it up because most people are dumb.
$C: There is so much hypocrisy in this video, my eyes are stinging. 
$C: I worked in television for years. None of this surprises me. It's pretty easy to program people who are essentially unable to think for themselves. Television has some of the most vapid, unintelligent people you'll ever see in a professional setting. 
$C: Yesterday, my democracy was safe. Today, it is extremely dangerous.

$C: Democracy doesn't sound like a real word after that
$C: Black mirror
$C: I was here for history
$C: Who the fuck watches local news?
$C: Mind control
$C: I love the internet.
$C: people act like this is new?
$C: This is ironically enough “extremely dangerous to our democracy”
$C: The irony is real
$C: Wow this is crazy I can't wait to see how the news reacts to this information.
$C: It's been thrown around that like 90% of media is controlled by 6 companies, so this is not really a surprise lol
$C: Wow.
$C: 45 gold what the fuck
$C: And Americans wonder why they are easily bought......
$C: Aren't these called packages? 
$C: Why do these news companys even need to exist? whatever happened to ma and pa news station? no one trusts them? they get buried under big labels like fox and cnn? people want to see brand names
$C: Resistance is futile  
$C: You have more good than Michael Phelps
$C: Welcome to the twilight zone..... uhhh why is the tv on but not plugged in?????  

........


This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: 2nd on this sub in 8 hours... 
$C: I have no money, but have my fake reddit gold.
$C: Amazing how they don't get it. If there were better news sources the poor ones wouldn't get do much traction. Think of one thing you know well and how often the news gets that thing wrong. 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: No shit I realized this years ago 
$C: Their smarmy, lifeless, dishonest, demographic targeting and focus group approved presentation makes me think that every news anchor and employee responsible for delivering this venom and every slumbering consumer absorbing and parroting this crap either have no soul or don't realize how much jeopardy their's is in by feeding this slithering entity called "The News".
$C: Oh. Dear. God. Why.
$C: Nothing against the anchors who are mostly just saying what’s on the prompter.  But I hope they all burn.
$C: This is extremely, dangerously dangerous to OUR democracy!

$C: Did someone already mention John Oliver's segment on Sinclair? Yes, okay, nothing more to see here.
$C: Why not just use one news anchor for all the channels?
$C: The thumbnail is the news I grew up hearing in the bank ground as my parents watched it. Beyond eye opening
$C: 45 gold WTF
$C: Scary thing to know they have this much control over news station and media
$C: I did not expect to be scared.
$C: u/HandMadePoopStatues 
$C: r/Nosleep
$C: Well. . .fuck. The sad thing is I already know there will be people who think this is totally legitimate and in no way corrupt.
$C: Bisis dextremly bangerus to our bemokrazy 
$C: damn.
$C: Lol holy shit. This is why I hate all these fake people in TV. They all say it like they are saying some super important, genuine thing that they care about, but it's actually just a fucking mad libs script. You really can't trust anything they say.
$C: It's nice living in yo momma lil bitch boi
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: For some reasons reddit keep deleting posts related to this topic
$C: 2000 upvotes off being the top post of r/videos of all time. 
$C: America you done fucked up
$C: We are Borg ..resistance is futile ...
$C: Welp, that was fuckin creepy as hell.
$C: I heard it on our local news.
$C: I wish I could tell you more pertinent news, but we're on a rating system here. the key factor is..."sensationalism" we've got you running from 9 to 5 *vrrrr* and 5-9. you're mine. I tell you what I want you to know,and you consider it the truth! nobody is opening their eyes! ....depriving the economy of our lives and natural resources. and are you happy? come on! I work for the system!
$C: Kinda surprised at the amount of news stations a single country has TBH.

Feels like you have 1000x more than Australia, but yet only have ~14x the population.
$C: Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
$C: This is freaky
$C: Well the GOP have never liked diversity.
$C: Commenting for future reference
$C: So scary😞
$C: The Sinclair company and many others control vast portions of various markets, and with their money and power control our governments. No amount of voting will fix the issue.

Doesn't this kind of shit make anyone else want to have a revolution, French style?
$C: Is that what the free mason symbols are used to signify

$C: Maybe I'm not getting this here but I don't see anything wrong with this. Maybe if they were giving a political agenda or something but seems more like it's a little warning label equivalent to teachers giving the same lecture over and over again. I mean how many different ways do you guys really think there is to say what they're saying? 

Nevermind it's common for scripts to go through news agencies being that there's no way a editor/writer are going to continually write & vet soft stories. There's nothing wrong with the message they're giving; it's not picking a side with anything. 
$C: Mind-blowing that at least 50% of the US is braindead 
$C: This is the malicious exploitation of decades of underfunding of local news outlets. If you don't support your local news, people like Sinclair will. 
$C: Can someone just sum this up for me? Don’t really have time to watch but I’m interested in what’s happening
$C: The more they say "democracy" the more it sounds like "the-mockeracy".
$C: This gives me such a gross feeling. 
$C: Is there anything we as a people can do?
$C: ...and they all look like douchbags...
$C: i watch local news for.... local news and diversify how I get my news through reddit, google news, pbs newshour, bbc radio, washington post, and cbsn. All of which I watch and listen to daily. Hopefully people aren't just glued to fox news, cnn, or facebook sheesh. 
$C: This is truly scary. I mean, this is like the stuff of a si-fi thriller movie.
$C: The more they say "democracy" the more it sounds like "the-mockeracy".
$C: LEGION
$C: I think that this is extremely dangerous for our democracy. 
$C: Not living in the US this makes little sense to me. The one thing I know though is the amount of gold being shared in this post, never seen anything like it... 
$C: Truth takes time and effort to get. We must dig for it and verify it once it has been found. Start by voting local. 
$C: Thumbnail is the local station my parents watch here in Arkansas.  Recognised the square head a mile away
$C: ALL OF WHICH, ARE AMERICAN DREAMS
$C: Big Cheeto Benito is double plus happy with it.
$C: OP is set for life with gold lol.
$C: Probably the most disturbing video I've seen in months. 
$C: I've been telling people this shit for years...
$C: Hey America, mind sorting out your government and country please? Regards, the rest of the fucking world.
$C: Democracy. 

Sounds weird now
$C: Damn that’s some nice karma farming 
$C: someone switched it from top comments order to best. fyi.
$C: Is this a deleted scene from The Matrix? 
$C: Well, this is how you get a point of view/opinions into people's heads. Repetition. Over. And. Over. Again. Politicians everywhere use this type of speech, too.
$C: You know when you try so say a word over and over like “Tug boat?” Yeah...
$C: "This is extremely dangerous to our democracy" has lost all meaning due to the semantic satiation...
$C: There's a ton of downvote bots on this video
$C: Look at the anchorman's hand gesture on the youtube preview picture. If you don't know how it's related to this thread, you need to go deeper.


$C: #Is this loss?
$C: Tf is going on
$C: I’ve never seen this many golds on a post before wtf
$C: "But fake news is fake!"
$C: Is life even real? Is fortnite really that good?
$C: Television, the drug of a nation.
Relevant: https://youtu.be/hD9pJzZ1XGI
$C: This is totally fucked up.
$C: Op deserves every single gold they have received. 
$C: On the plus side, younger people don’t watch tv, especially these mews channels. They are desperately trying to keep the older generation turned against social media, and the more transparent and widespread media sources that span the internet.
$C: Full list of Sinclair owned stations from their site, and it is disturbingly long and very monopolistic:

http://sbgi.net/tv-channels/
$C: Weird as fuck lol
$C: Is it just me or is the post losing votes and gold at the same time?
$C: This is like a start to a black mirror episode 
$C: At least the guy who owns Sinclair Commutations has a brain tumor. Of course this shit is like having a brain tumor
$C: Michael Jackson - Tabloid Junkie
$C: oy vey
$C: What are our options? How do we fight this? As well as voting, what more can we do?
$C: Commenting so I'm apart of history
$C: That's a fuckton of gold
$C: Why is this flagged as disturbing content? 
$C: Welcome to 1984.
$C: At this point I’ve pretty much tuned out all news outlets. Facts, by definition, can’t be disputed, and I’m finding that for the past couple of years that’s exactly what has been happening.

People seem to be confused with the difference between their INTERPRETATIONS of facts and the FACTS themselves.

Don’t get me wrong, I still read the news every day, but other than the indisputable FACTS of an event, I tune everything else out.
$C: Now thw better question to ask here is... Why were you tuning into all those stations?
$C: Wait...it is April Fools Day...this has to be a joke....right? 
$C: Can somebody transcribe what they all say collectively at the end, because although I don't techinically have a hearing problem, but sometimes when there's a lot of noises occurring at the same time, I'll hear 'em as one big jumble. again it's not that I can't hear, uh because that's false. I can, I just can't distinguish between everything I'm hearing
$C: It's almost like social media connects people in different communities. Also someone at Fox who "like never uses Facebook" didn't think of that.
$C: Glad these completely independent news companies are giving us the low down on what fake news looks like. 
$C: Wow. That was terrifying.
$C: Makes you wonder about the main headlines being pushed.
$C: I thought this video was to show that all sides in this political conflict kept saying the same things -like calling each other biased and not double checking their sources- but none of them made a move to solve the issue.

Well, it’s something completely different!
$C: Well I guess Charles Kane is alive and well.
$C: Well Trump is right again. 
$C: Thats alot of golds
$C: That gave me the willies and not in a good way, wait
$C: In unison they chanted; muh russiah haxorz
$C: Got a bit meta at the end there, "this is extremely dangerous to our democracy."
$C: Haha who is still watching TV anymore, while we can get the truth from the internet??... Oh.. wait..
$C: I've never seen so much gold in one post. This really is a special day!
$C: You know how you repeat a word enough times that it becomes meaningless?  I feel like this was just applied to each local news station.
$C: This made me sick
$C: 52 x Gold. Damn Well deserved 
$C: Haha DemocracyNow reported on this already a few weeks or months ago 
$C: Is this the brotherhood of nod from Command and Conquer? 
$C: I really want to know if any of them have actually seen this video and know if they care.
$C: This is all kinds of fucked up.
$C: I'm glad we are actually able to watch this. Time for everyone to wise up.
$C: Good

$C: 'MURICA!
ENJOY YOUR PRESIDENT
$C: Jesus fucking christ
$C: I pooped a little.
$C: Democracy is non negotiable. This needs to be crushed into submission before it does real damage. 
$C: This video was on top 5 trending about 2 hours ago.
It's completely gone from trending now
$C: Holy shit OP! You have enough gold to make your own 50 something news stations now!
$C: Watching that same phrase being repeated over and fucking over again slowly drives me insane
$C: What fucking dystopian shit is this damn 
I mean , I always knew it was happening but not like this !
$C: So will anti-monopoly laws stop the Sinclair merger?
$C: holy shit x58 gold that’s the most i’ve seen
$C: 192k upvotes and 52 gildings. Wow
$C: Heard the word Democracy too many times in that and got some semantic satiation going on. Not even sure it’s real anymore
$C: Amazing effort! Very worrying. You did a wonderful job on this.
$C: This is a threat to our democracy 
$C: “Wake up, Mr. Freeman. Wake up and smell the ashes.”
$C: so... it's extremely dangerous to our idiocracy ? 
$C: April fools?
$C: More fucking people need to see this.

Seriously. 
$C: It's raining gold, proceed to pick one up from the ground 
$C: You know when you hear a word so much that it stops meaning anything and just sounds weird? Yea, that happened to the word democracy.
$C: fifty fking two golds woaw thats the highest iv ever seen on a post/comment on Reddit!
$C: I did not realize it ran all the way down to the local affiliates. How disgusting...
$C: Chills
$C: Underground Network, Alternative Communication 
$C: I   M      O   U   T
$C: This is sad ....
$C: So this is what it's like to have schizophrenia?
$C: "Democracy"
$C: Tragic
$C: Wow, this is incredible.
$C: This is obviously very creeptastic, but can someone tell me what it all means? What are the implications? And who plans to benefit from all this?
$C: ALL HAIL PLANKTON.
$C: SBGI bout to tank come Monday
$C: Waiting for /r/democracy to weigh in 
$C: This video is extremely dangerous to their monopoly
$C: terrifying
$C: [removed]
$C: THIS is extremely dangerous to your democracy!
$C: Very good
$C: Thank you ministry of truth
$C: These guys obviously never went to school and copied their friends assignments,

Amateurs.
$C: You know people are going to say this is fake news and these are all actors
$C: THEY'RE LYING TO US!!!!
$C: What do you think the 2016 election was all about?  Propaganda
$C: Absolutely incredible and horrifying. Perfect video to show someone who eats up everything the media tells them.
$C: I love the pretentious look of the moderators. ☺️
$C: When you copy your friend’s homework
$C: This, this is powerful.
$C: Those sounded alarmingly similar.
$C: Make it stop
$C: Puppets all. 
$C: 55 golds, holy shit
$C: So I guess this is extremely dangerous to democracy?
$C: Seeing Cedar Rapids IA on reddit is always a surprise. 
$C: Logical conclusion to the 'fake news' narrative. 
$C: haha this blew up.  You should bow to your robot overlords.
$C: It's Ok because it's not Venezuela, amirite?
$C: [deleted]
$C: So wait.... I’m confused... Is this dangerous to our democracy? Not exactly $100% sure about this...

11/10 would totally not-not double-triple bang again
$C: Truly hope this wakes some of you up to the fact that the US media is corrupt and has been corrupt for a very long time.  They're merely a tool for the political and financial elite to manipulate the public-at-large.
$C: Are you going to post this outside reddit so that real people see it?
$C: It like watching an oxymoron formulate. So funny!
$C: This is scary. Nothing else to say. But ya, this is fucking scray. 
$C: Well, as long as the message is reasonable (which it seemed), I don't see why it's so bad several news station read the same script?
$C: NA btw
$C: They are correct "This is extremely dangerous to our democracy" 
$C: This is what they are all saying: 

>Hi, I’m(A) ____________, and I’m (B) _________________…

>(B) Our greatest responsibility is to serve our [x] communities. We are extremely proud of the quality, balanced journalism that [X] News produces.

>(A) But we’re concerned about the troubling trend of irresponsible, one sided news stories plaguing our country. The sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media.

>(B) More alarming, some media outlets publish these same fake stories… stories that just aren’t true, without checking facts first.

>(A) Unfortunately, some members of the media use their platforms to push their own personal bias and agenda to control ‘exactly what people think’…This is extremely dangerous to a democracy.

>(B) At [x] it’s our responsibility to pursue and report the truth. We understand Truth is neither politically ‘left nor right.’ Our commitment to factual reporting is the foundation of our credibility, now more than ever.

$C: 1984? Nope, its 2018.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to everyone. The US has a military industrial complex 
$C: Was anyone else judging who said 'this is extremely dangerous to our democracy' the best? 
$C: [Not really a big surprise.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM8L7bdwVaA)

$C: Can Someone explain me? I don't understand it lmao
$C: Oh my god.  This is horrible. 
$C: While watching this I found that [PBS did an excellent story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNhUk5v3ohE) on Sinclair and how they may soon own so many local stations nationally that 3 out of every 4 Americans will be watching their news broadcasts.

And I could not imagine going to school for years to be a broadcast journalist and ending up having to read these scripts that force conservative talking points. I'd just feel so dead inside.
$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Bix44C1EzY
$C: Lmao this shit is insane but also, based off this video, so many local newscasters are white, blonde women. That’s kinda strange too
$C: All...hail...
$C: I don’t understand how this is a big deal. This is a general broadcast and not something specific. They are airing it on all their networks, not like it’s a very specific story about one event which was aired exactly the same. Would be the same as seeing the same commercial on different channels around the country. 
$C: More horrifying than everything else in this video is that eternal show smile.
$C: I think I just threw up in my mouth.  This is an amazing editing job.
$C: Well... I hope this shit doesn't spread to saner countries.... 
$C: So what's the problem with this?  There is nothing partisan in the message.  It's saying "Hey, a lot of lies out there, we're gonna try not to do that."  

Does anyone disagree with any particular part of this message?  Why is the being portrayed as some pro-Trump bullshit.  
$C: Time to stop watching. 
$C: This is completely terrifying.
$C: Good lord the USA is a mess.. But we all knew that :p

Good job editor though.
$C: This is extremely fucked up.
$C: What's the big fuzz? It's ehithole country 101
$C: Ahahaha APIRIL FOOLS! Right?

...right?
$C: One day they will scream " no! Stop using the internet! Watch us! We are best! We still lowbrgrlgrbel yowullgrlwlwl....hsssssss" slowly drowning in their own TV blubber.
$C: Democracy..... Democracy..... Democracy..... Democracy 


Word's lost all meaning. 
$C: They'll learn from this. Next time it won't be so obvious, and people over at /r/worldnews will keep taking the media's word as gospel
$C: Fuck this is scary
$C: Please be April Fools
$C: April fools! Oh.. wait
$C: Comment number 10000.
$C: There is a solution! Turn off the TV!
$C: Wow
$C: This makes me feel sick. 
$C: Damn... Is it the nanomachines?
$C: Most upvotes for a post that I have seen since I got reddit
$C: Who said it better! 
$C: This is extremely bad for everyone.
$C: Isn’t this ironic? They are being forced into a huge corporation which they are being controlled by. That’s the real threat to democracy, a corrupt information system. Big brother is watching.
$C: Imagine what you were taught as school children. 
$C: I believe this was the reason local news stations couldn't be owned by a conglomerate. Same with newspapers. Then that law changed.

$C: How many younger people actually watch broadcast news any more?
$C: https://youtu.be/5vBGOrI6yBk
$C: Us
$C: For those not disturbed by this, let me ask two questions:

Firstly, if a wealthy corporation bought up numerous local TV channels and made them broadcast pro-Khmer Rouge, pro-bestiality, or pro-Islamist propaganda, would you be happy about this?

Secondly, how do you know if they won't turn on you someday? What would you do then?
$C: Wtf
$C: Great editing, quite shocking. It seems to be extremely dangerous to your democracy.
$C: That was so creepy when all the voices overlapped.
$C: Sinclair broadcasting? Totally doesn't sound like a company that has eyes wide shut parties 
$C: Welp, this is not good
$C: The expression of the thumnail lady on the right (purple top): "Isn't it so sad? Isn't manipulation bad?"
$C: Skynet Has Taken Over!!!

$C: For the record, the San Antonio station's ratings are perennially #3 and #4 out of 4 english newscasts for well over a decade now.
$C: Please make this stop! Is there any real news? Is it all fake? Are we just living in a simulation? It’s still Berenstein to me damn it!
$C: I used to work in the newspaper industry. Back in the 80s. The reporters and editorial staff I worked with were some of the most dedicated people I've ever worked with. We would work into the wee hours of the morning, if necessary, to get every point of a story correct before it went to press. These talking heads who have sold their souls are nothing close to a real news person. 
$C: "This is extremely dangerous to our democracy" - This will haunt me for the next one week.
$C: Can't wait for the remix.
$C: I'm game for a revolution in media. Let's riot, and burn corporate news with public discussion!
$C: Now, what are you going to do about it America?
$C: I feel more like 1984 everyday 
$C: Something seems wrong here.
$C: Lol the black guy with the dimarkacy.
$C: I don’t have cable anymore so I should be good.
$C: this is good for bitcoin
$C: WOW
$C: Lying press indeed
$C: I'm not sure the USA is a democracy.
$C: The culprit: National Amusements.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Amusements

The news used to be important. Now we have he internet. 

News media across the board make money by getting their audiences pissed off. That’s their business model in its entirety.

Avoid that shit like the plague. There are zero redeeming qualities.
$C: 59 gold? Is this a record?
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Ok but who is Ardemarcracy and how do I help them? They sound like they're in trouble.
$C: Come to Hungary. It’s an everyday thing here .
$C: THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO OUR DEMOCRACY 
$C: I’m REALLY hoping this is just an elaborate April Fools Day joke...
$C: Hole lee sheet
$C: Scary.
More on the issue:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNhUk5v3ohE
$C: Local news anchor not being honest that they are reading a message from the CEO and not their own or their station's opinion 
$C: We need protests outside of these affiliates and we need to tweet shame ever damn lemming "news anchor" in the video. 
$C: There's no way in hell we could broadcast that as a commercial on all those networks, is there?
$C: I looked up the stations where I live online:

1. It was kind of nerve racking to scroll down to my state

2. Now it makes sense that the two crappier local news stations that had to merge are owned by Sinclair.
$C: ''And next, interview with a high school shooting survivor. Please prepare your designated chairs to be orderly thrown at the TV set''

$C: All stations owned by Sinclair. Then the question becomes, who owns Sinclair?
$C: technically news has become nothing more then propaganda pushing the agenda of a few really rich people.
$C: I’ve never seen so many upvotes and Reddit golds. Such a good post
$C: Wtf I swear I've seen this video before but now it's been gilded 60x!?
$C: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PStpvviPgxk
$C: Currently top 10 on /r/all all time. Well deserved. This is creepy as fuck.
$C: Im wondering: do these individual anchors know that all the others are saying this exact script? could some of them feel like what they are doing is original and good? I mean the parent company is the villian here..most of these small market hacks are just earning a living...
$C: Did they do this to make a point, or did someone very clever catch this?
$C: Conan O'Brien has been making fun of this in monologues for years.

$C: Aaaaaaaaand democracy is no longer a word to me. 
$C: Holy. Fucking. Shit. 
$C: which of the news agencies owns everything?
$C: It is now officially on youtube trending page!
$C: How this shit is legal baffles me
$C: If EA created the most downvoted comment in history, this should become the most updated post in history. 
$C: wow
$C: Feels like an episode of Black Mirror...

$C: Three hours ago this post had 8 gold stars. Now it has 61.

Now that's impressive
$C: America btw
$C: Unbelievable...
$C: No worries folks. More and more people are cutting cable. Young ones don't even watch news, they have tablets and youtube. This will be sorted out by itself in a decade. Can't wait till their investment dwindles to zero.
$C: You know what’s really “extremely dangerous to our democracy”? The death of local news. Terrifying.
$C: The fact that reddit deleted this from the front page. And the fact that it's not on YouTube trending really worries me. The media isn't on our side. And the major social networks/ entertainment sites are not on our sides. 
$C: they live we sleep 
$C: I noticed several NBC peacocks in the mix, so it's not FOX specific conspiracy.
$C: Conan pointing out something similar about local news 5 years ago

https://youtu.be/1o9x-yDyN78
$C: [deleted]
$C: Can someone explain why this matters 
$C: What in the actual fuck. PBS, The Guardian, and VICE News? please don't fail us. Great googly moogly!
$C: Now that was scary 
$C: That concerned look on their faces...not sure if it’s fear of the NSA getting them if they fuck it up or they just don’t want to do it...sorry to say but your country is completely fucked right now.
$C: I guess this is beginning of the death of cable /broadcast news.  Soon, many will choose not to listen to concerted nonsense like this.  I already wince when I watch local news because it’s so utterly useless half the time and waste of my half-attention.  I rather support npr and listen to that.  
$C: Saw this in Canada a couple years ago and thought I was crazy, literally word for word, picture for picture segments on 3 news stations when I was flipping the channel. It was ridiculous.  Never saw it again.
$C: I have come here to chew bubblegum, and kick ass. And I'm all out of bubblegum!
$C: As soon as I thought "damn, literally all of them are white," the one black anchor told me: t h I s I s e x t r e m e l y D a n g e r o u s T o O u r D e m o c r a c y.
$C: we'll done
$C: Hey Trevor, bring this back to the Daily Show. 
$C: Shout out to Norma Holland who is a news anchor in Rochester!
$C: Only 63 gilds?!
$C: Sinclair just purchased Tribune so you can add WGN, Food Network and CareerBuilder to their assets as well. 
$C: This is the most terrifying, Orwellian, dystopian thing I’ve seen on reddit. 
$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GT9m0jX9vw
$C: Feel like im watching casting tapes for a role as a news anchor
$C: Is that lady in the white wearing an Ivanka dress?

$C: This is Watch Dog 2 Right here
$C: Hey look. A real life black mirror episode.
$C: This is fucking terrifying.
$C: #8, count it down with me people!
$C: Currently top 3rd of all time on Reddit
$C: I feel like you could edit in a gun to the back of their heads as they read
$C: When you see your own local news station in that list of, " It's extremely dangerous to our democracy." Geeze that gave me chills. I remember seeing the broadcast as well, but I couldn't hear anything because I was in a restaurant.
$C: This was all set in motion a long time ago. It’s also the real reason the net neutrality rules were changed. Most of the younger generation don’t watch TV so now they can filter that too and there isn’t a damn thing we can do about it. 

It’s not like anyone will push a story on the TV news to oppose it. I don’t think people fully understand what really happened and how fucked we are. 

With the current situation a president can trade a political favor and make one call to have something pushed or shut down. Or easily gather support for another needless war.
$C: ‘This is extremely dangerous to our democracy’ 

If the same would have been said in another country the USA would accuse them of indoctrinating their citizens and call the tv station a propaganda channel. 
$C: The foxification of America. Will you stand.by and let it happen?
$C: I don't know if this is good or bad. Let me know.
$C: Remember lads; inverted totalitarianism is a system that inhabits the empty shell of democracies and acts as if meaningful democratic debate continues, when it truth it does not.
$C: I see this video every day at work and just realised the true implications after watching this video. I'm sick to my stomach now. Government controlled media puts A LOT of effort into brainwashing us.
$C: Seriously, one of the biggest upvoted videos I've ever seen!

$C: Holy crap I just saw this in my home page and was like “how the crap does this have 61 golds” 

I see now
$C: So what's the most gold anyone has ever received?
$C: The chick on the right looks so sad for the democracy. 
$C: #7 woot woot

WHATS IN THE BOX
$C: Tied with second most upvoted post of all of reddit, easily first if you count all the duplicates elsewhere
$C: Metal Gear Solid 2 (2001)
$C: WE'VE BEEN ZOGGED!
$C: 63 gold holy shit. Worth it though.
$C: Didn't John Oliver say something about this a few months back? Why suddenly now is it big?
$C: Dead on accurate. 
$C: Depressing...
$C: What kind of hive mind type shit...
$C: Unity? When am I going to be introduced to the hivemind too? 
$C: No.1 On YouTube!
$C: From Alternate Facts to Alternate Reality
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our demarcacy.
$C: All your news are belong to us!
$C: This video made me almost as uncomfortable as the way news anchors and reports speak. It just gets under my skin for some reason.
$C: It sound like the borg!!! Resistance is futile! 
$C: He’s an idiot. 
$C: Well good thing I don’t watch tv or the local news.

Where you can get a Glock and a gram for the cheap
Where you can live your dreams long as you don't look like me
Be a puppet on a string, hanging from a fucking tree 
AGHHHH
$C: 1:28 “This is extremely dangerous to our demarcecy”
$C: if you were 1 of the anchors/ reporters.. would you have gone along to get alone or would you have said no? and, if pushed, would you have left your job over it?
$C: I can't hit the up votes as much as I would like to.  This trouble me a great deal.  It is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: I'm not American, but this is frightening because whatever is going on in the big countries affects all of us. 
$C: Remind me!  2 days
$C: Someone please tell me this is an ellaborate April fool's joke, and we're all getting bamboozled.
$C: Spookey
$C: Sad how there are actually people out there who will deny this is any form of propaganda and that everything they’re saying is true.
$C: Geez this seems to be extremely dangerous to our democracy 
$C: More like extremely dangerous to there bottom line!
$C: Dare I say? This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. Wish we can send this to there emails on loop.
$C: You vill lose 
$C: What they're trying to say does NOT jibe with how and why they're saying it. 
$C: 241k likes DAMN this is blowing up
$C: wow. just wow
$C: This reminds of the old school pro wrestling territory days. Promoters would rework the same angles and lines in different local markets knowing that there was little chance of overlap. That went out the window with cable. Local news had no such threat but videos exposing this stuff give me hope that the internet may reduce the power of the media. 
$C: Holy gold, batman!
$C: USA is fucked up 
$C: What's crazy is that local "news" audiences would sit there and eat their dinner and watch the news and find nothing out of place about being lectured about fake news being a "threat to our democracy". I cannot help but think that most of the audience of these stations must be made up of Trump supporters.
$C: This is some shit from V for Vendetta.  ahh Hell naw.... 
$C: This is even more obvious in print.
$C: Orwell would be terrified
$C: I love democracy.
$C: Aww, that's sad...
$C: democracy xd
$C: Well, we don't need any more reasons to stop watching the news.
$C: Does the BBC do this. I think it’s a world wide conspiracy.
$C: 66 gold. I'm glad this got ample attention. Hopefully we all band together now and do something. 
$C: Psst /u/Washingtonpost this is big
$C: Wow! More people need to see this!
$C: [Democracy] (https://imgur.com/a/4pZHP)
$C: NEXT!
$C: Mindbendingly dystopian =/
$C: Is this related to Sinclair's settlement with the FCC for running sponsored content during news segments without properly attributing it as such? 

I agree it's disturbing, but the only content concern button you can click is on their own website. 

Perhaps we should all click it? 
$C: It's crazy how this is going over some people's heads like "ya see fake news! told you!"
Total selective bias.
$C: Masons brainwash
$C: Not long till some deadpan-serious news anchors announcing the president’s decree of banning opposition parties in America.
$C: yo this is scary.
$C: so many channels and nothing on 
$C: These pretzels are making me thirsty.
$C:  Literally just fucking watched this in my writing class. Wtf is happening to my life.
$C: Wow, got removed twice from this sub before they finally kept it on here, now its the most upvoted thread of all time. 
$C: Wow
$C: This could be dangerous...
$C: Another example:
https://youtu.be/pklk7fCHSXE
$C: That makes sense actually. When I think news I think more than the general cable networks ,but newspapers and the like as well. You seem pretty reasonable so now I’m curious. 
$C: Why’d downvotes for seeking out more information? Nice look y’all!
$C: Ironical...
$C: The real issue, is the number of idiots, who buy all the BS, these stations dish out.
$C: 66 gold's wow
$C: Disgusting.
$C: Is it just a coincidence that this appeared on Reddit a day before it was on Last Week Tonight?
$C: Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Donald Trump wgah'nagl fhtagn!﻿
$C: Why is it always a male/female combo? Are M/M and F/F taboo?
$C: Is anyone able to explain to my why this isn’t at the top of popular on the reddit app when I order it by top posts of all time? It appears to be the second most upvoted post on reddit
$C: Woah, scary stuff right there
$C: You know what's really ironic? The guy who originally compiled and shared this video on Twitter, Steve Franssen, is very pro-MAGA, pro-Trump, and intended to share this video as proof of liberal mainstream media being biased and show them spreading propaganda. Sinclair Broadcasting skews pretty conservative, however, and they have "must-run" segments usually defending Trump and his actions. A former Trump senior campaign advisor in 2016, Boris Epshteyn, who is the Senior Political Analyst at Sinclair, is also a regular on the network. Sinclair has a clause in employee contracts that heavily penalizes reporters who try to quit their jobs. Also, Sinclair is the largest TV broadcasting company, and if their upcoming Tribune merger goes through, they will have the sort of monopoly that no one will be able to challenge.
$C: B
$C: T h i s  i s  e x t r e m e l y  d a n g e r o u s  t o  o u r  d e m o c r a c y
$C: Sounds like they’re all auditioning for the same role.
$C: local news in a couple years https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3h8ZnXLsRg
$C: This is unsettling.
$C: One of the reasons why I stopped watching TV news 8 +/- years ago 
$C: That is one of the most horrifying things I have ever seen. Not joking
$C: Damn.

We are so fucked right now.
$C: Woah thats a lot of upvotes
$C: Gee, it sure is a mystery why so many people mistrust the mainstream media.
$C: Hey. Why is this video not showing on all? 
$C: Noticed that they are all Fox stations the President likes Fox. So he wants us to watch the fake news. So CNN is the real news.
$C: I feel a great need to be part of this momentous part of /r/videos history
$C: the sad thing is most older people won't see this video, and will continue to be brainwashed by TV news
$C: All are brain control for reptilians
$C: Damn, my news channel was in there...
$C: WTF!
$C: Bil3zy reddit
$C: OP almost has lifetime gold.
$C: But like, we all agree with the message, right?
$C: I don't get why this is such a big deal, truly. I will probably get flamed for this but why don't people just stop watching it if they don't like how it works, it's not like everyone's not on their phones 24/7 anyways just do your own research or look at the sources you trust etc.
$C: There are 69 golds!

Nice 
$C: ironical
$C: tHIs iS eXtREmLy dAngErOuS tO oUr deMOcrAcy
$C: THIS... is extremely dangerous to our democracy...
$C: Woo-hoo! Wjar made it!

I still watch them. They seem to be self-aware of the bias situation and try to distance themselves from the Sinclair mandatory programming. 
$C: PBS and BBC are my friends. 
$C: Please be April Fools
$C: this was done on purpose

$C: Democracy is a mistake.
$C: History to be made here
$C: 69 gold stars? Cool

$C: This is extremely dangerous.
$C: I know I’m super late to the party but how is this not top of r/all?
$C: That's...... Distrubing.
Never thought American news was this similar across the board
$C: The subtitles couldn't handle all the voices.
$C: Not that I'm complaining, but why is this post from 2 weeks ago showing up on my front page?
$C: Game over
$C: The irony is that THIS truly is dangerous to our democracy 
$C: What the fuck
$C: THIS DUDE GOT GILDED 69 TIMES
$C: hm this seems extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: 2nd highest post of all time on Reddit. Well done u/patientbearr, and keep up the good work.

Truly a disturbing video which should make us realize the dangers of one company owning so many news stations which creates biases and significantly lowers freedom of the press.
$C: Conan had a bit like this a year or two ago, he did it a couple of times. No jokes, just playing one clip after another. 
$C: Can we talk about how you got 70 Golds for one post though?
$C: This is extremly dangerous to our penis. Oh dayuuum! I failed again... 
$C: The word “democracy” sounds weird to me now.
$C: I gotta be honest, I don't *really* see this as being as bad as people say.

Do you think the guy reading on your news isn't reading an autocue? These are regional networks, and are reading from the same script. It's no different than having one anchor from a big company do the same.

I mean, it's not without it's dangers, but I'm more concerned about competitors of major networks reading the same shit than I am about regionals of the same company.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: **this is extremely dangerous to our democracy.**

$C: [Donovan Mitchell exceeds expectations for Utah Jazz](http://brandsauthority.com/donovan-mitchell-exceeds-expectations-for-utah-jazz-the-denver-post/)
SALT LAKE CITY — Donovan Mitchell hasn’t just surprised executives from the 12 teams that passed on him in last June’s NBA draft — 14 franchises if you include the Denver Nuggets, who sent their pick to Utah, and the Sacramento Kings, who traded down from the 10th spot.

As the rookie has exceeded the expectations of Jazz fans, turning them from despondent over the loss of Gordon Hayward to positively giddy about their dynamo rookie, it’s fair to count the very Utah decision-makers who picked Mitchell among the surprised.

The previous bridge, which ran over the St. Vrain Creek, was destroyed by the flood five years ago.

$C: Don't blame the anchors (well blame them a little) if they didn't say it, but they will get fired and or someone else will say it. They need to eat as well. Blame the laws. People should not be allowed to own, and control the media in such a way. In my town one company owns the isp, cable, phone, news station, radio stations, local newspaper, and the press that prints other papers. They literally control everything people in our area know. This is why an open internet is important.

$C: OPs inbox continues to be flooded to this day 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: And this is extremely dangerous to our democracy, too. 
$C: Maybe it's that new assisted suicide thingy....
$C: Editing skills on point.
That final line, “This is extremely dangerous to our democracy,” is especially chilling in that it sounds more and more like gibberish the more it’s said. 
$C: Anyone with half a brain should be able to recognize that the "fake news" with-hunt is just a way to control the narrative and flow of information
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 😔
$C: It felt very symbolic that when the video started overlaying their voices it sounded like robots were speaking.
$C: This is disturbing especially considering how influential local news is on my parents and grandparents daily lives and opinions on their      communities.
$C: I swear this was from page 2 or 3 months ago. Did we really give this repost 3 years of gold?

Also, that video is still scary
$C: "This is extremely dangerous to our democracy" on loop. If that isn't the most dystopian reality nightmare I don't know what is. 
$C: I don't even watch tv and don't live In the US so this isn't an issue for me luckily, it is pretty stupid that one company owns so many, they can just spin there narrative and it will get to so many viewers, this is why the internet is slowly killing television or at least the more traditional style of it
$C: Wow
$C: How many acronyms can they invent... 
$C: But they aren't saying anything wrong at all, someone at one of their stations reported something incorrectly and they received backlash so they were all sent memos to apologize and address the issue to their viewers.

They aren't saying anything bad or even biased, quite the opposite really.

Yet this got gilded 72 times.
$C: Americans can't surely believe that they are a democracy? :D
$C: hi, could you please fill my survey, it's much appreciated?

$C: I'm from Ireland and watching this terrifies me. 
$C: This is why I don't watch any of these bullshit newsstations. There are very few news outlets with journalistic integrity anymore
$C: I just want to punch that stupid looking woman on the right in the thumbnail
$C: I hear from you 
$C: lmao
$C: Hi people
$C: I'm late to see this but Can somebody do this for Indian news channels?? Times News Network seems to do the same shit , feeding millions repeated manipulated garbage. 
This really concerns me.smh
$C: Its actually disturbing how this is happening.
$C: fucking erica
$C: spooky.
$C: WTF
$C: This is interesting 
$C: Top post of all time
$C: Good job
$C: Nice post dude
$C: Unfortunate Beth hunt is on the cover pic of this....can confirm she is good people
$C: This is this year’s most upvoted  post on reddit that’s unarchived. #2 overall. Congratulations!
$C: The dystopian future is already here. 
$C: 73 golds. 

Why
$C: Something the left and right can agree on. 
$C: This is some Orwellian shit right here. 
$C: Here before comments & upvotes get closed
$C: If this is such aTrump issue, why does the media always shit talk trump?
$C: Not creepy at all
$C: Scripted Robots saying what theyre told to say. 


Shame....almost nobody speaks from the heart anymore...
$C: Thats some heavy scripting
$C: “You can copy my homework. Don’t worry about changing it really the teacher doesn’t care”
$C: #salem #underground #wgnamerica
$C: This is fucked
$C: This is scary as fuck. All of these stations need to end. Fox, NBC, CBS, ABC - end them all. I don’t even need to think out the specifics to know this can’t be the news we’re supposed to be getting.
$C: i may just be stupid but i don't really understand what's going on here other than a bunch of news stations using the same script, can someone eli5?
$C: This is gonna be part of the newsreel when America finally cracks. 
$C: That is quite scary..  How can we trust what we watch anymore? The news, the one thing that transfer information to us of what is happening in the world. How can we rely on them for credible  info? They seem to just be puppets repeating anything.
#yikes
$C: It's extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: What's extremely creepy is that they even do it with very good acting. They are literal actors.
$C: I I’m commenting before this gets archived
$C: Include me in screencap
$C: The last gasps of a dying empire.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Good to see many people waking up about the mainstream media. This is why we say it’s fake news
$C: YOU MUST HATE TRUMP

YOU MUST HATE TRUMP

YOU MUST HATE TRUMP

YOU MUST HATE TRUMP 
$C: CNN is fake news. 
$C: [removed]
$C: [deleted]
$C: Pundits are extremely dangerous to our country. 
$C: Holy fuck.  the conspiracy guys were right.  the cia owns and controls all news agencies 
$C: Ultimate proof that the media is garbage
$C: It doesn't necessarily have anything to do with Sinclair, it's the anchor scripts that are not being re-written or even slightly changed for individual stations. Stations pay to access stories from across the country--they can essentially copy and paste the script it came with, or they can re-write their own. A crappy news producer (or an overwhelmed one) won't re-write, which is how shit like this happens. 


Source: worked in broadcast news 
$C: I'm in full agreement that this a problem and something needs to be done to de-standardize at least local news, however, I really don't find this video as disturbing as everyone else seems to. I was never under the illusion that news anchors were genuine on air, they're just actors reading off a script. Of course those scripts will be the same if they're all put out by one company.
$C: Wow, that is terrifying. I’m curious...is there a left leaning media conglomerate similar to Sinclair? And if so, are there similar style mock ups?

Just want to have an even keeled knowledge base before I got bananas.
$C: [John Oliver did a piece on the Sinclair media group last summer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvtNyOzGogc)  It is kinda disturbing that these "must run pieces" are part of US news stations.
$C: Conservative ideology really is a blight on this nation.  
$C: Redditors don't like it when other people control the news. Only Reddit should be allowed to control what people see and hear apparently. 
$C: "How can we spin this into something that relates Russia to Trump without acknowledging our side of the spectrum's involvement in the propaganda" - /r/politics, currently
$C: 18,000 views on the video but 65.7k upvotes and 10 golds?  Something is off here.  I agree with the message but this is being pushed by someone. 
$C: Whats the difference between 20 local news stations following one script and 1 big news station following one script?
$C: This is why I don’t watch the news.  
$C: This is why I'm happy to pay a shit-ton per year (~500 CHF) on contribution for public television/radio that is obliged to serve unbiased news.
$C: Conan O'Brien used to do regular bits about this.
$C: So when they say we're getting 100 channels we're actually getting like, 47...
$C: My favorite is when Mike Meyers had a kid and every station said the same thing.
$C: In Soviet Russia, Democracy is extremely dangerous to you!
$C: Old media is really piling on this FB "scandal".
$C: fuck
$C: If you rely on TV news for any kind of meaningful information you're as benighted as these poor souls are.
$C: But are they wrong? 
$C: The explanation is wrong, the title is click bait. All of media tries to sell, all stations, regardless of ownership participate. They want the best stories so they get the most money. Period.

The content is up to people with money who want to manipulate us. Probably to get more money and power. 
$C: If anyone is interested in more about Sinclair broadcasting, look up Last Week Tonight's episode on them. 
$C: Nobody seems to have pointed out the fact that Conan O'Brien had a bit about this a few years back.
$C: It’s like newscasters are the Borg. 
$C: Damn, are they all handed the same script or something? 
$C: Here’s a thought. This is no different than a company with multiple branches using the same messaging in their answering service. Way to try to blow up absolutely nothing into something. Nothing to see here. Move along kids...
$C: They are warning us about the stuff they do themselves hehe priceless
$C: This is less evidence of some grand manipulation of the public than it is of the fiction that local news still exists. Here's the formula for "local news"

* 1-2 police scanner quotes, issued by an "on the scene" reporter standing on a random street corner, preferably with overtones of fear, uncertainty and doubt.
* 2-4 AP, Reuters or network-authored stories, quoted without change
* 3-5 talking heads, paid under any reasonable market rate due to hopes of being able to get a national role.
* a pinch of 1990s era graphics
* wardrobe from Goodwill

Stir until combined and half-bake on low.

$C: Maybe it was my phone but their lips did not sync up with the words they were saying in some parts. 

The “danger to democracy” part was especially obvious it looked like they were saying extra words but the audio was just overplayed on it.
$C: Seriously, is this really surprising?  The creater of this video NOT realizing this makes this video have that creepy conspiracy theorist made video vibe.

Come on.  Having your stations, if you own the network, have largely the same news stories, except local news, makes it easier to operate.  

If you have a large company, you want uniformity.  If you don't realize that, welcome to the workforce. 

Your job as the consumer of the news is to analyze the news.  These companies tend to have their own biases: Fox, ABC, NBC, CNN...list goes on.

You can't take things at face value nowadays.  There are various sources to get unfiltered videos such as liveleak.  If you care about a certain issue or topic enough, you do your own research.  A "piece," you have to remember, is usually written by one or more journalists, approved by their manager(s) then circulated as you see in the video.  Those journalists can make mistakes (again, surprise).

You gotta do your own research to validate the information and ensure that you get objective information along the way.
$C: At least we can still trust CNN
$C: The video has 8.7k views but this post has 14k plus up votes......wut?
$C: thiS iS extremelY dangerouS tO ouR democracY
$C: Well they aren't wrong? and this is extremely dangerous to our democracy!
$C: [Did you purposely leave out the end of the script because it doesn't fit your agenda?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBlZCeRMRyY) The end of the script calls for viewers to report cases where they feel that their station has reported fake or biased news. It is literally telling viewers to call out their local news when their content is false or misleading. This is akin to a fast food chain asking customers to review their experience online, or an airline asking a flyer whether he was satisfied with his trip.

But yeah, I mean, if you edit it all together like that of course it will look spooky.
$C: Except we don't have a democracy. We have a constitutional republic. There's a difference.
$C: "this is extremely dangerous to our democracy"

The condescension coming from some of presenters is something else.  
$C: 26k upvotes and only 14k views...
$C: This is what all news stations sound like
$C: So when msnbc, cnn and new york times sit their jerking each other off with crap like “sources familiar with their way of thinking” that is perfectly fine lol
$C: It's a good thing we live in a republic. Don't have to worry about the broken democracy they speak of
$C: But who did it best?!
$C: I always thought this happened because some stories come from the network instead of the local affiliate. 
$C: Genuine question for people who are angry about this:

Would you be as upset about it if it was *your* side spitting the propaganda? 

I mean. Think about it for a minute. 

When people complained about news stations trying to sway the election by only posting negative stories one way, back in 2016... They were told they were conspiracy theorists and nuts.

But now that you're actually seeing it and seeing exactly what it's become, suddenly NOW it's a problem because... it's no longer *your* propaganda?
$C: Seems a little ironic that this post currently has 31k upvotes but the video only has 16k views, am I missing something?
$C: ITT:

A bunch of authoritarians screeching about how the other team shouldn't have that kind of authority, *they* should. 
$C: Sinclair "news" stations are extremely dangerous to our democracy...

$C: I didn't catch that, is this dangerous?
$C: All local news affiliates do this - this isn’t just a Sinclair issue.  The local news editors just grab the script and videos from the network and build their shows around that.

With the proliferation of the internet, it’s made television news practically a relic of a bygone era, so less advertiser money is coming in, so stations are forced to cut costs, and this is what you get.
$C: Creepy, but at least the message is accurate and important. 
$C: TV new's obsession with 'fake news' is just dislike of new media. In it they see their own irrelevancy so they try to delegitimize whenever possible.  
$C: THIS is extremely dangerous to our democracy...

$C: First order of business after the blue wave is to get Trump out.  Then break up Sinclair.
$C: The danger is looking you in the eyes, and you still can't see it!
$C: John Oliver did a very funny, and informative, piece on monopolized news. Scary stuff; we really are being fed what companies want us to ingest.
$C: sinclair is the fox news we don't know about
$C: Down with Sinclair Media Group! 
$C: Watching the media is for sheep.
$C: John Oliver did a segment on this. It was pretty mind blowing how much control these people have.
https://youtu.be/GvtNyOzGogc
$C: I mean, outright falsehoods being spread on social media *is* dangerous to our democracy.  Dunno why sinclair or whoever thought it was a good idea to make all these local affiliates repeat the same message verbatim, but I cant I disagree with it.
$C: Baby Boomers have destroyed the country. Once you start collecting social security, you should lose the right to vote.
$C: I like how last time this was left-wing news stations and everyone said "meh they all use the same filler content when nothing more important is available".

Now that it's sinclair the consensus changes. Typical reddit
$C: Holy fuck.

I am *sorry* America, I just didn't know... I will never judge the idiots in your country ever again
$C: This has literally been happening for decades.

But trump did it so let's have outrage lol
$C: And yet all you fucktards here on reddit will continue to mock Trump's "fake news" points.

Idiots.
$C: This is what happens when marketing people live in a bubble. The same sort of phrases parroted out constantly.
$C: MSM talking about fake news makes my laugh every time but then makes me sad that millions of people still believe what they say
$C: Fox, Clearchannel and these guys are all the same. They will tell you that there is a danger from the "left leaning media" while being shills for the GOP and being "the" major stakeholders in pubic media. They take their playbook from Joseph Goebbels, control the media and the voter. Democracy depends on an informed electorate and these guys do their best to make sure the USA has an electorate that is not only un-informed but what they do have for information is slanted. 

$C: What people forget is that none of this would ve possible if it weren't for Hilary's husband signing a bill in 1996
$C: Do we not understand they are not journalists. More like paid actors. 

Source: worked in production. 
$C: american news today. mind blowing how americans think THEIR news isn’t a controlled propaganda machine but somehow everywhere else it is.
$C: Sinclair is not the only media conglomerate like this. 
$C: 60k upvotes with 18k views on the view?
$C: 60k upvotes but video only has 18k views? 
$C: Where was this video when i was told “don’t use the term ‘Mainstream Media,’ because it makes them sound monolothic, and they aren’t”?
$C: And this is why I laugh every time a trumptard tells me a Democrat is part of some deep state conspiracy.
$C: i hope this doesn’t get removed. 
$C: I actually don't get what the problem is.  They have said nothing that isn't true.  Now if you show evidence that they are colluding on fake news, then I see where you are going.  But that each station puts forth what the ownership wants said, and it is valid and true?  I don't see this as evidence of a problem.
$C: But fox isn't even a news station. They have said in court that they are for entertainment purposes only. A lot of what they say isn't true.

How does this script not include that disclaimer? This seems very illegal
$C: People, this is not a partisan issue. Cnn, Msnbc, Fox, they all push bias and only are called out by the "other side" while said people ignore their "side" doing the same shit. If this scares you, look at your own partisan news stations with the same criticism as the opposition.
$C: i dont get why yall are acting like this somehow undermines the news or puts us in some 1984 world (more than anything else does) . 

Anchors reading prewritten scripts? oh no. tell me it isnt so. who gives a shit if theyre reading a script written by some local guy in the studio or some nationally distributed one.  These stations still report local news and find local stories, its not like theyre content is any worse than it already is because of this. Does it bother you that local newspapers will take AP articles and publish them? if that doesnt, this shouldnt either.   Also, the local news already belongs to one of the big 5 broadcasting companies so they werent independent local stations in the first place. the video editing makes it creepy but i dont see how this is scary otherwise.
$C: People still watch the news?
$C: Huffington did a report on this a couple weeks ago. This video really provided the article with terrifying context 

[Sinclair forces news casters to recite Trump-ian “fake news” promo](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/82zp60/sinclair_forces_local_news_anchors_to_recite/?st=JFG1DP2F&sh=8b43b140) 
$C: Wasn't it Clinton that made sure of that? Bill that is.
$C: Serious question: how is this any different (with each station reaching a few counties) than CNN in every airport and doctor's office in America? It's still a single message getting out to everybody.
$C: all shills for fox news
$C: It's always been like this, don't ever trust the media or the excuses we have for "journalists" today, they're always lying all the time.

The only reason they're pretending to care about biased news because now people not in their organizations can easily spread stories that disagree with their official narrative.
$C: I kept trying to explain this to my ex. Just because it's your local news station, doesn't mean that it isn't still run by that same giant right wing conglomerate, spreading that same disingenuous message.

This really hammers the point home.
$C: And yet, people are still waving it away when Trump points out fake news. 

If you don't see it at this point, it's either stupidity, or a serious case of cognitive dissonance. 
$C: This comment was deleted by your national government. Yes we know your entire comment history including the ones you deleted.
$C: Wonder what /r/the_donald thinks about this
$C: Oh Sinclair, you dirty rascals 
$C: Who watches the news anymore? 
$C: Been saying this for years... fuck Fox 
$C: Why is everyone saying this is all because of Sinclair? Lots of ABC news feeds on this too, for example ABC7 which is owned by Disney. This goes beyond just one broadcasting group which makes it even scarier
$C: Wow...God Bless Trump!
$C: Josef Goebbels would be crying great tears of joy if he could see this.
$C: That's a lot of golds
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy 
$C: The person that made this is hated by a lot of very wealthy people right now and should run and hide find a way to contact Snowden ASAP.
$C: Obviously there are some dirty mods trying to block this. Thankfully there are some other mods who aren't cunts 
$C: This happens with blue apron commercials on different podcasts but you don’t see people freaking out about it
$C: When will this country wake up and realize that our MSM is just as engaged in propaganda as Russia and North Korea are to their own people?

The only difference is Russia and NK are blatantly state run, here in the US it’s all done under the table and they try to fool us into believing we have independent journalism. 
$C: I've yet to figure out the level of danger this has in regards to our democracy.
$C: IM HOW TO BASIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
$C: I work at one of these stations. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: So Trump was right about media collusion?

This video pretty much proves it.

Thanks for whoever got this re-approved.  105k upvotes, Trump must feel really vindicated if this goes viral.
$C: <sees the brotha>
NO THEY GOT YOU TOO
$C: We're fucked ladies and gentlemen. It was a pleasure playing with you this evening. 
$C: Between this and the Scientology Network, I wouldn't be surprised if the Trump administration greenlights a 24/7 network devoted to the Westboro Baptists.
$C: I'm surprised more people aren't talking about the irony of the video since they are they are the ones trying to control what people think.
$C: Well this was terrifying 
$C: [This is extremely dangerous to our democracy](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zHU2RlSCdxU) 
$C:  Can we post the emails and twitter accounts of all these unAmerican losers? They’re all just robots being paid to further an agenda. Let’s shame them. 
$C: "I fucking told you"

-Conspiracy Theorist Trump Voters
$C: They're making a mockery of our democracy.  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: Why did they only use clips from CBS, ABC, and FOX? Does OP think that those three companies covers all the news circuits? 
$C: My moms response, paraphrased: " I believe in what they said, theyre all talking about CNN, MAGA"
$C:  I see a lot of meme potential for "this is extremely dangerous for our democracy"
$C: [deleted]
$C: Now who owns all the mainstream media?  Redpilled yet?
$C: I'm going to play devils advocate and say this is what happens when you put unpaid college interns in important positions such as the person responsible for what goes on the teleprompter.


I made myself laugh with this. 
$C: Telecommunications Act of 1996.
$C: Is this the point where we realize the point of the first ammendment? We need a central source of truth. Someone who asks the REAL questions. A direct questioning to the government. Someone like john oliver but on their own website, their own untainted money source. We need someone who directs the masses on a true path, by the people for the people. Where we have a voice.
$C: Serious question here, I think we can all agree this is a real threat to our democracy. I think most of us would agree that both sides of  the party line are at fault for this.  Since 2000 both parties have owned the presidency, congress, or both and no one has done anything about it. At this pivotal time with new information about large conglomerates and buying members of congress coming daily, why would you want to restrict firearm access?  Almost every media outlet is pushing the exact same agenda albeit with a different script. Wouldn’t this be a prudent time for a populace to be armed?  
$C: creepy. also I'm not really encouraged by the fact that this post dissapeared from the frontpage, being the most upvoted/gilded thing at the time. maybe just a mod that tried to push his/her agenda, but that really is the least worrysome scenario. 
$C: Conan beat you by 4 years.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM8L7bdwVaA
$C: Stories like this are pretty common. They are given out by a news service that produces all of the dialog and you can also here it on radio as well. It’s not uncommon but it was really creepy hearing it about the given topic. Made me want to throw up a little. 
$C: Anyone remember when Conan showed [this](https://youtu.be/TM8L7bdwVaA)
$C: Didnt John Oliver run a piece about this? I saw a video on YouTube about this and they showed how one sided they are and how they mandate heavily conservative end pieces.

**Edit:** [He did] (https://youtu.be/GvtNyOzGogc) 
$C: The paranoids on r/conspiracy are going to be taking about this for months
$C: This disturbs me a lot. How about we vote for people who are actually like us and not billionaires. 
$C: This has been happening for ages... here's 4 videos from as long as ~5 years ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PStpvviPgxk&list=PLHTDmkg9apDz2qyZ6nqhCZC5cBx7SdkJi
$C: Rarely is a video so scary I want to turn it off. I did with this. Just knowing how in the digital age where we should be more exposed to the truth and have more freedom we are more imprisoned and susceptible than ever. We are tucked. 
$C: ALL HAIL HYPNOTOAD
$C: Pretty sure that company is the government. 
$C: Did no one even listen to what they were saying? It was extremely unbiased true. 
$C: ITT: normies finally getting it.
$C: US is a democracy? 
$C: [so concerning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96lAHygeIU)
$C: I worked in television on the national scale before.  In fact I worked for a major distributor and it was my job to monitor local affiliates.  I've also worked in national news.  I'm a so-far Trump supporter

I'm not surprised and I'm very happy that the illusion is beginning to fracture.  These are people with jobs and their talking points are always carefully crafted.

All any redditor would have to do is go into a news studio and smell the coffee, smell the fresh paint, the roast of electronics and lights, and you'd realize that it's all a hollow illusion.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePiZIKGUdXA
$C: Doubt this video will go down well with middle America
$C: I have nothing interesting to say. Can I have an upvote like everyone else?
$C: Everything about this video is horrifying. Especially the irony. Like it's not even funny.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy! 
$C: This is just the tip of the iceberg believe it or not...
$C: They are pandering for the retards called "democrats" 
$C: not as dangerous as progressives
$C: It is nice of you to start the conversation of with insults..thanks. What are you referring to when you said I say the dumbest shit?
$C: Huh, maybe capitalism and the news don't mix well together.
$C:  the MSM know they're fake news and are doing this in a creepy attempt at pointing the finger and projecting
$C: This is now the highest upvoted post in reddit history
$C: This make me furious as hell. time to change some shit!

$C: Don't worry guys, once they see this they will make sure to change up the wording a little when they collude so this doesn't happen again.


$C: Why is everyone acting like this is so surprising. The issue runs much deeper than this i.e just look at the comment section here...
$C: Sinclair is a conservitive leaning news organization. They valued making sure that thier news stories are factually accurate and as unbiased. 

Unlike all the mainstream media that sell out to extreme far left, these news stations will focus on what matters instead of witch hunting a president, demonizing our constitutional rights, and appologizing to the world for being American's first. 
$C: lol at all the leftist authoritarians in the comments.
$C: Sinclair can fuck right off, but this video is hardly disturbing. The anchors are reading a corporate mission statement- of course they're all saying the same thing. 
$C: Why pick on just Fox?  Comcast/NBC is no better.  How about Disney/ABC ?  Viacom/CBS ?    
$C: [deleted]
$C: This has been a thing for decades. Reddit only cares now because Sinclair is slight less left leaning than others.
$C: CNN is fake news 
$C: I love this cause it seems like people are starting to wake up to the bullshit instead of falling for the programming. 

An educated and aware American public is the last thing they want. If anyone is interested in learning more search the CIAs "Operation Mockingbird" as well as MK Ultra.

$C: Is this extremely dangerous to our democracy?

Edit: *Yes*.
$C: THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO OUR DEMOCRACY

Edit: Spelling
$C: They are extremely dangerous to our republic with their fake representation of claiming we are a democracy.  The USA is NOT a democracy.  The USA is a republic. Republic meaning Ruled By Law.  We are ruled and our government is restricted in power by laws.  A democracy is mob rule.  The mob doesn't make laws.  The representatives do.  And our constitution has protections to prevent the mob from over-ruling it.  The word democracy does not appear in the constitution or the constitutions of any of the 50 states.  We are NOT a democracy.  Calling us a democracy is a mind-game to make you related democracy with Democrat.  Guess you can call it the original fake news of the Democrat party...
$C: Isn’t that kind of dumb, like obviously the company is going to want the same message on all of its local channels

$C: This post is being brigaded by /r/fuckthealtright.  If you say anything about this being a political post violating rule #1 you'll be down voted to keep the mods from seeing it.

For the dumbies who think this is a call for censorship: it's the opposite.  /r/videos either allows ALL political videos or none at all.
$C: Obviously this was edited by a shill.
$C: I love how up in arms reddit is about this even though practically the same thing is happening on this very platform... it's just the other side of the political spectrum so they let it slide or are blind to it.
$C: This looks like a special statement the stations' owners wanted read by all their stations. Its not everyday. 

- What IS everyday, are the **morning** "news" shows all showing the SAME anti-Trump stories, the same anti-Trump *angles* to stories, and all "reporting" on each others' anti-Trump stories.

- What IS everyday are the **evening** "news" shows all showing the SAME anti-Trump stories, the same anti-Trump *angles* to stories, and all "reporting" on each others' anti-Trump stories.

- What IS everyday are the **late night** "entertainment" shows - whose hosts and staff are 100% the same political ideology -  acting as the "ridicule" faction of the yellow media, like so many others have done throughout history.

- What IS everyday are the **morning** "news" shows then "reporting" on the ridicule by showing clips of the late night shows' ridiculing of the political opponents.

The news and parody eventually runs together, until the barely-paying-attention public convolutes the real man with the caricature.

But you didn't even notice any of that going on..

$C: Shared promo content is nothing to care about, That shit actually IS written by the business people. Marketing people don't write the news. What's far more alarming is how the actual NEWS content is either the product of leftist group-think among writers, editors, producers and directors, OR simply lifted intact from the AP newswire, the content supplier to every newsroom which also skews pretty far left. Groupthink among media people is far more dangerous and pervasive than the influence of corporate accountants.
$C: Thank god for CNN/ABC/MSNBC/CBS/NBC/NYT/WAPO/VICE/HUFFPO/VOX and the other 99.99% of the media telling me what to think! Please do the thinking for me, because I find it too hard!

$C: Mainstream media of all kinds wants social media to be considered extremely dangerous for our democracy because they are losing control of the narrative.  I know so many Baby Boomers who think exactly like what the news tells them.  Social media is a great way to provide a check against the very disturbing centralized narrative that this videos shows.  It's fantastic to see everyone rallying around this video.  Social media has its issues as well but it is an absolute necessary part of discourse now.
$C: Why are you people acting like it was any different before sinclair came along? There's always been scripts for mainstream news, given to them by the military industrial complex and intelligence agencies to parrot the lies of whatever terrorist administration is in power at the time. 
$C: I am surprised ppl are surprised or shocked by this. It's very overt and it essentially the same systems brands use to reach their market. In this case it's a brand that is promoting an ideology/political message disguised as journalism which is *supposed* to be unbiased but we know that's a bunch of bull. 

It's a "free country" (quotes because: mostly) and if you have enough money to own a bunch of television stations then you could dictate what the message would be to suit your own political agenda(s) or ideologies and beliefs/dogma. 

This is why I think CA requires all college students to have taken the golden four classes to attend college, one of which is a critical thinking class. Most of the country do not have to do this as far as I am aware and that is a huge disservice to those people imho. If you are unaware of how propaganda, and campaigns of disinformation work then you will be manipulated into supporting an agenda that is at odds with your own value systems.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Although it's scripted, I like that they are bringing to attention how "fake news can be dangerous." 
$C: Its funny to see how Americans are shocked to find this out

like its just happened........sheep
$C: Muh Russians controlling you!!!!!!!
$C: Hey guys, let's all make jokes and laugh about this thing pointing out obvious huge flaws in our systems, rather than try to take part in any kind of change. See you at work tomorrow.
$C: Don't trust anything on the TV, the papers, the internet, the goverment and any large companys. It's all about money and control. Trust Family and Friends. 
$C: I work for sinclair (throwaway of course) and work is an absolute shitshow right now. One of my bosses say they think the guy who made this video is from a rival news conglomerate. Emergency board meeting was held. Probably going to be an announcement soon on one of the news stations ill keep you guys updated.
$C: It’s crazy how the alt-lefts on reddit were demonizing Trump for calling the media fake news. But now behold the truth that Trump was talking about. 2 years later. 
$C: Well... They aren't wrong in this clip. This isn't uncommon though. There are videos like this all over of how different media conglomerates do this shit. The news is fixed, if you are just learning this you are a small brained child
$C: This is what happens when the government controls the media and uses it to herd us like cattle. Media is the new religion. 
$C: People really need to wake up and I'm super glad this is on the front page. Regardless of your political beliefs, fake news is 100% a thing. The news tells you what it wants you to believe. Please please please, don't take the media for fact. President Trump has done alot of foul things but I have never seen the news report on a single good thing he has done (YES, he actually has done something other then spew out slurs and attempt to murder newborn babies!) Please don't let the news and media sway you. Fact check everything.

$C: Sure is nice when you single out fox and ignore that every other msm company does this.


$C: This is what happens when you select videos to edit together to make certain networks look bad.           
Not saying it's good, but you can do the same with all the MSM news channels.       
Interesting who is left out of the video more than anything.

$C: This has been going on for awhile now....

(Conan O'Brien from 2012)

Here's an article explaining a little bit about how the phenomenon happens: http://thedesk.matthewkeys.net/2013/12/heres-how-conan-obrien-gets-news-anchors-to-say-the-same-thing/
$C: Yeah this is scary and all but there's no point in getting worked up. There's virtually nothing anyone can do
$C: Well, sure. When you realize that all local affiliates get handed the same script from their parent network, you realize that all local news is mostly stupid. 


But in this case, the uniformity of the message doesn’t matter. Because the message is correct — depending on what their definition of “fake news”.  




So the real question is who exactly is this company?



Is this a public service announcement warning the public about anti-democratic, far-right propaganda disguised as journalism?


Or is this far-right propaganda trying to blur the line between journalism and misinformation?



The uniformity of the message is bad, but not for the reasons this post is implying. The problem is the message is so generic it could be a message from legit journalists talking about Putin’s FSB misinformation tactics, or it could be the FSB using journalistic rhetoric to delegitimize real journalism.



And this is why disinformation is so successful. 
$C: BREAKING: We are a constitutional republic, NOT a democracy.

The real danger isn’t in the unified message, but the message itself. Just more lies meant to mislead and misinform.

It’s incredible how often we are described as a democracy by the media and it’s so fundamentally wrong.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I know I’ll get downvotes for this but... Trumps’ been calling out the media for a while now, and it’s one thing I’ve appreciated.  Now mostly he calls out CNN, and this is the type of thing I take from it.  Not just mass partisan messaging or omission, but the complete breakdown of journalism integrity because of our capitalist society.  When only a few corporations control 100% of the nation narrative, that’s how you end up with propaganda. “Gee how can we make sure the masses hear and believe one thing? Oh yeah pay or do favors for the top media executives”.  

And if that propoganda wasn’t part of the main narrative, it’s fake news.  Scary thing is, the lines are so blurred about what fake news is and all these big corporate run/lobby groups and their “fact checkers” it’s hard to believe anything you hear if you recognize any of it, resulting in some activism but mostly apathy.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Ironic since this is exactly how the mainstream media was to conservatives for the past 40 years.  

Hypocrites trying to save their one sided bias. 


$C: They didn't say anything false though, so I'm glad they have a singular script that is fact-based not ideologically-based.

Please insert another 25cents, and try again.

$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.  
$C: That was very very creepy
$C: Holy. Shit. 
$C: What. The. Fuck.
$C: Well okay People's Democratic Republic of America.
$C: "This is extremely dangerous to our democracy..."
no fucking kidding
$C: This is how "fake news" became a thing in our culture. Fearmongering propaganda fed through ***all*** media outlets saying "ONLY LISTEN TO THE MINISTRY OF TRUTH" under the guise of helping you, reminding you to check sources etc. knowing you will not question unnamed sources in (alphabet agency or gov. institution here).
$C: Does anyone know of any RELIABLE news sources?
$C: The irony is strong with these ones... 
$C: Holy fuck, that was pretty jarring. Props to whoever put that together.
$C: I feel like all these news reporters completely lose credibility 
$C: This is the best post I have ever seen on reddit.

If you are the creator, well done.
$C: The media machine. This is scary AF. 
$C: This kinda scared me. 
$C: WE ARE LIVING IN A DYSTOPIAN NOVEL
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy, you guys.
$C: When you prioritize virtue signaling over character that's what you get.
$C: Don’t watch a lick of news. Completely ignorant to anything that’s going on in the world. And with this video I couldn’t be happier about it. 
$C: Ok now all the "this is extremely dangerous to our democracy" comments are scary too, its endangering our democracy

$C: Well at least they **all** follow the same script across the country
$C: This post got removed from my front page... hmm
$C: **REDDIT IS HIDING THIS POST**
$C: Of course main stream media hasn’t been doing this for years! 
$C: "More alarming, some media outlets publish these same fake stories… stories that just aren’t true, without checking facts first."  
  
This from the people who forced their stations to run a story about Isis cutting teens in half with chainsaws that has no corroboration and a single report from a "well placed source" via iraqinews.com.
$C: All those poor 60+ year olds that actually watch local news..
$C: I've always wondered about what gets repeated over different news stations
$C: Serious question. When showing this to a Trump supporter, what do you say to them to really demonstrate what this means and why it's dangerous? By itself I don't see this video changing anyone's opinion. All they will say is, "so what? They can't repeat the same opinion so they are consistent?"
$C: The real boogie man of America is not Hispanics or terrorists. Its not liberal democrats or conservative republicans. The true shadow that you should fear is the one that lurks behind 173 local news stations and doesn't want you to know that they are weaving a web to capture and control your information.
$C: ITT: People who do not know what is a news group wide [editorial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editorial)
$C: Media concentration is a problem, people.
$C: Lotta white people...
$C: So is this the same "local news channel" like I'm in the east bay cali, and someone might be in Texas but they need to get the same story out.

Or is this different networks all together using the same script?
$C: 70k upvotes, 10x Gold and counting..
$C: I don't know I'm really craving anal right now.
$C: I’m Australian... can someone explain ? 
$C: Am I wrong to say that I kind of agree with them? That fake news and not fact checking on social media (and other sites) has lead to things such as... I don't know... Donald Trump. That it is in fact extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: When I saw this I wondered “why does this have 10 golds?”

Now I know. 
$C: The one guy said “Demorcracy”
$C: T.I.E.D.T.O.D
$C: lel


$C: .
$C: Shitpost copypasta: TV edition
$C: lol FOX NEWS. 
$C: Couldn’t this be said for other major news networks too tho?
$C: This is interesting because I agree with their message about one-sided news stories and fake news being a problem and a danger to democracy but Sinclair and right wing organizations of their like are exactly the ones who are doing so.
$C: These look like promos shown between commercials which, to my limited knowledge, is nothing new. 

You're seeing something out of context and it's forming an opinion for you. Which is just as propagandizing as the stupid script for these stations is.
$C: I wanna date the girls on fox news
$C: What are they talking about? 
$C: I hope all of you are getting your daily dose of propaganda
$C: What democracy? Since when we had democracy?
$C: [Conan has exposed this phenomenon before]
(https://youtu.be/TM8L7bdwVaA)
$C: This shit happens at most news outlets that are owned by one company. Nothing really new here.  Same thing with radio station too. 
$C: These pretzels are making me thirsty.
$C: and **WE ARE LEGION.**
$C: Anyone notice there was one person who wasn't white? 
$C: Who the hell still watches TV news?
$C: What the hell? I hate media bias now! 
$C: They were all given the same statement by their parent company and asked to read it on air. I don't get the outrage that these people all read a canned statement. I suppose it must be the subject matter, but that has nothing to do with their unison message other than showing how neat it is when you overlay news anchors reading the same thing. Would be no different if it were a scripted advertisement. You could probably make one of these with radio hosts pitching roofing companies where I live. This is the news equivalent of a fast food chain issuing a new sign and telling franchisees to post it nationwide. This is more r/mildlyinteresting than /r/politics.
$C: I haven’t watched this watered down bullshit some call news in many years. I cut the cord years ago. Good riddance 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: Reddit in action
$C: Guess someone wasn't so far off talking about fake news.
$C: Diggable ⛏⛏
$C: *Looks at reddit activity suspiciously.*
$C: THIS is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Seeing the sheep eat grass is funny
$C: Fuck... 
$C: wait... so news anchors are just actors reading a script?
$C: >5 hour old post

>glided 22 times

>12th top post on r/videos

oh boy.
$C: Can't this message go both ways though? Listening to what they said I agree that there are media outlets pushing the fake news Trump espouses everyday without checking their own facts. What did they say in the video that cast the fake news light on actual credible journalism?
$C: What do you mean "democracy"? That is not even a word.

/s
$C: Omg that's messed up. Good thing I get my news from reddit
$C: Duh, this is why I read reddit for news updates. Can't trust that TV yall. It's dangerous for our democracy.
$C: This is fn hilarious and 100% PROOF that our wonderful Government controls almost EVERYTHING the MEDIA tells us!! Amazing clip right here people! 
$C: Can anyone confirm these are real stations? wouldn't want to get bamboozled. 
$C: Just remember that we're all commentors who gets their news from a Conde Nast owned company

Nowhere seems safe 
$C: #deletenews is gaining momentum
$C: Is this dangerous to our democracy?
$C: brilliantly edited
$C: Okay so I know that this will probably get lost in the cloud of comments now that this is on the front page but I feel like somethings need to be said. 

NPR reported on this incident over a week ago when the parent company that owns all of these stations(I forget the name) issued this. This company has been known to support Trump and did so during his campaign. That leaves a really bad taste in people’s mouths. 

However, it is important to realize that it has been proven that “fake news” was played on both sides of that election. A shit ton of fake news and fake profiles in social media was used to influence the 2016 election, which completely changed the scope of the election according to data scientists. This does in fact make it extremely dangerous to any democracy. 

Despite it coming in a very creepy format like this clip, the CEO of the company realized this after the last couple of months and decided to use a platform that he owns to send a message to the US. 

Creepy: yes
Unwarranted: no
$C: If you are bothered by this only now you haven't been paying attention for the last 20 years.
$C: Oh you mean like CBS, NBC or ABC?   

They've owned local news stations across the country for 50 years.
$C: I'll going to gild this bc I don't pay attention and I don't have a brain.
$C: This is a far bigger threat to freedom of speech then some college kids whining about that idiot Shapiro.
$C: This video could have been 12 seconds
$C: Did people really not know about this? This has been going on for years and years.
$C: [deleted]
$C: It's not at all clear to me that the script Sinclair had anchors read is "media bashing" -- rather, it sounds like channels trying to promote themselves as more reliable & less biased than other media outlets. Is every case where a media outlet claims it's better "media-bashing"?

Edit: here is the FULL transcript. It’s what the video doesn’t show.

$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Fuck Ryan Wolf.  I'm glad he left the Rio Grande Valley to San Antonio fucking cum dumpster.  Still, 5 number 1!
$C: Can someone please explain to me what this means
$C: That moment when “this is extremely dangerous to our democracy” morphs into a comment about the video itself.
$C: This is literally all corporate owned media though except you dont see it through literal same scripts its just stories being pro-corporate and fit into an agenda, read manufacturing consent
$C: this is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Thanks Bill Clinton! YEAH!
$C: So who owns all of these local stations?


NewsCorp?


I thought they only owned Fox, ABC is owned by Disney, NBC I think might own CBS I dunno who the parent company is though.


Are all of these local channels just franchised and owned through an investment group or something?


That would make some sense...
$C: At this point who do we trust?
$C: The Telecommunications Act of 1996.
$C: Telecommunications Act of 1996.
$C: And people still think that only Fox News is fake news
$C: If everyone on this thread has collectively come to the conclusion that multiple states are being brainwashed every single day by the people they see dictating what is going on in the world, why don't you all just stop watching the news? Or find an amateur enough channel that doesn't sway from facts to myths, or truth to bullshit. 
$C: I am okay with news stations espousing opinions that agree with my own, but this is different and concerning. 
$C: Thank you, mods for undeleting this post. 
$C: Just Monika
$C: "Our" democracy.
$C: I've  never seen something have so mach gold.
$C: I feel like no one really watches the news anymore though. Everything is online now right?
$C: The news is propaganda, everyone knows this already. 
$C: Fucking sheeple
$C: This is fucking disturbing. 
$C: I'll just gonna leave this here:

https://vimeo.com/225558325
$C: I remember when this one dude pointed this bullshit out a while ago. and people made fun of him. I forgot if this was before or after he became president but that doesn’t matter. 
$C: So basically the left and right sides of the political spectrum are scum bags? Whoda thought lol
$C: how is that disturbing? 
$C: /r/conspiracy
$C: [deleted]
$C: What are you gonna do with all that gold OP?! 
$C: Yea, Social media and fake news. Thats the problem. 
$C: REPUBLIC!!!  Why the hell can't people get it through their heads that this nation is a Republic not a Democracy.  Have these people never said the pledge of allegiance, or read the constitution.  Hell, even a basic understanding of how either form of government works should be common knowledge, and enough to figure it out.  Jeez
$C: 1:28.... those two are banging. 
$C: Anyone else not bothered by this? I feel like I am the only one to see this isn't that big of a deal. 
$C: Guys, these stations are reporting on *local* news and *communities*, any coordination of overarching propaganda is a coincidence as these stations are *on your side*. /s
$C: Sounds like typical media. As soon as any story breaks out, you will get the same headlines except the wording will be different. Then you are hammered with all talk news shows reiterating the same points.  

This may seem more eerie because they're using the same exact words instead of same content but different wording.
$C: Yo can i get a gold?
$C: [removed]
$C: to be fair TV is dying and I dont think it'd be clever to spend energy on different scripts for every channel etc
$C: Again, this is only a conservative/republican problem because only that party has gone off the rails.  There is a difference between the two parties.  No democrats are trying to control hundreds of media outlets, disqualify millions of voters, all while adding in fear and confusion to the mix.  When your core demographic is shrinking, the next best thing you can do is change the rules at the expense of democracy.
$C: I mean, this could be an issue. But so is the kind of fake, tabloid message proliferating in "news" media today. Sending the same message on all their stations, when that message is an accurate warning, as a one time thing, is fine. 

If all their news reporting is scripted from the same source, that's more troubling, though - if they receive news from a central news agency that works diligently to report the truth, give unbiased hearings, and not fucking lie, or accept lies without sources as "fact" that's still fine. 

Caveat: Not an american, but your cultural cancer of partisanship is spreading. PLease stop.
$C: I think alot of companies/news station have scripted shit
  I dont get it?  What did you guys expect?  So before this you all believed everything on media was honest news?  Uhhh k then.
$C: Do you really expect them to rewrite national news scripts for each station? This doesn't prove anything.
$C: Holy shit, how the fuck this exploded to 14th most upvoted reddit post of ALL time (!!!) in 13 goddamn hours?   
Can anyone help me understand?
$C: I really hope this is April Fools.
$C: op got 59 gold holy fuck
$C: always remember, 'fake news' is a term created in 2016 to begin to discredit investigations into sliced fast food gate, they are scared.
$C: welcome to "fake (scripted) news
$C: "Stop saying fake news what a threat to democracy for the president to call out fake news!"

 " get check out this video example of fake news while talking about fake news and questioning news is a threat to democracy" 

Reddit's left and right have been fighting back and forth between who's side is fake news, which explains why we've been dead silent on fake news over the past couple months after years of pointing it out before, but Karma.....uuuuh.....always finds a way.
$C: So what? The US stopped being a democracy long time ago. These so called journalists are nothing but tools for the ultra rich. 
$C: Y'all know there's more than one 'local' station in every market, right? You have a choice in what you watch. Sinclair isn't really much different from Any other large media outlet, including the big networks..
$C: I've never seen a black reporter until now
$C: R/conspiracy 
$C: I mean is this unexpected? When you go into any chain store you get the same pre written engagement from the employees. Is it supposed to be different because it’s on tv? 
$C: You guys are dangering our democracy by showing this. Our democracy has to remain danger free otherwise our democracy is in danger, come on sheeple.
$C: this is bad right?
$C: This is the best Reddit thread I've seen in a long time.

Keep exposing these degenerates!
$C: I am surprised that people are surprised. 
$C: Holy shit!!!! You live with a mate and ply PS4?!!!!! Wow!!! I had all wrong, I’m sorry. 
$C: News has always been scripted. I commend the person who put all that together, but the outcome was to be expected. 
$C: Could it be that they write a few stories of national interest that they distribute to all of their stations but most other stories are local and thus different? Maybe? 
$C: "These pretzels are making me thirsty." 
$C: bring our the guillotines!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
$C: also fuck these traitors spewing bullshit lies. They are the first line of defense in the social contract and have fallen as traitors 
$C: Boycott now!  Contact advertisers and ask if they are ok with this!
$C: Not sure why people are surprised by this. John Oliver did a segment on this last year where he put all segments side by side, showing how they were all saying the same thing.


$C: Probably get buried in other responses, but doesnt anyone find it strange that if all the news sources are the same, it's scary, but if they vary, they are all "biased?" Not sure how to respond to the thought, just seems like there's no middle ground that'd make people happy 
$C: 911, wtc 7. To real for the news Network to craft upon.
$C: Commenting for later
$C: This  is RUSSIA, we're being distracted by ties to trump & social media, THIS is how they swayed the election.  Look into Boris I believe he is a Russian Agent of influence, https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/26/1647369/-Boris-Epshteyn-jumps-ship

$C: People don't realize big media has been doing this stuff for decades.  They never saw because they agreed with the narrative and brushed it off or subconsciously turned a blind eye.  Everywhere you would go, would be the same words used in talking points across different media companies and platforms.  They got their morning talking points and ran it all day.  Talk radio has been using montages of this stuff for decades.

$C: Whoever created this and the OP are enemies of our state. They are no worse than communists who try to tear down the West’s freedoms. Don’t let the tricky editing fool you, News Agencies share the same scripts for many stories, especially those that affect us on a national level.

Soon the silent majority will crush this screaming minority who seeks to destroy our country within... we now have the greatest leader of this century at the helm, and it’s time for the workers and patriots to stand up to and put this country on a course towards dominance and expansion. MAGA!
$C: Well.....since it’s all anti President Trump and pro blm, it’s okay.
$C: Holy shit
$C: Soooo is this a bad thing? I legitimately don't see what's so wrong about this.
$C: This is literally how all media is ran. 

Edit: You guys *REALLY* need to do some research. Something like 2 companies own *all* the media outlets.
$C: foxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
$C: Not sure what the issue is here!

Isn’t this just a network supplying a statement to their satellite stations warning of the dangers of shoddy journalism?

They basically just read a company-wide memo saying “There is a lot of false information out there, which is even affecting our electoral process. We do not support that. Be careful where you get your news.”

How is that a bad thing?
$C: Holy shit this guy got blasted with gold!! Hey spare one 🙏
$C: A company can only own 5 media outlets (TV stations, radio stations, or print media) per market.  So some silver lining.
$C: Could you call that a repost? 

I meant the videos...not. Oh nvm 
$C: What is the one company you think? 21st Century Fox, News Corp, Viacom...?
$C: Remember remember the 5th of November.
$C: Lmao my local station ran this same shit last night...It’s crazy ppl still trust the news 
$C: Democracy.. Apply directly to the forehead! 
$C: They are all CBS stations...  It’s not that they aren’t “local” they are part of the CBS Network.  
$C: posting to Facebook, nice

$C: And this is why Trump won.

Because the mainstream media is garbage. it is 

#FAKE NEWS


$C: That video had no effect on me whatsoever.  Now, I'm just going to sit down, and be very afraid of non-Fox news stations, which are extremely dangerous to me. 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our plutocracy.
$C: that's a lot of white people.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: The reason this happens is that news organizations often get their news from the same news conglomerate (Associated Press is one example, Reuters is another). These stories come with sample scripts, and the news team is often too lazy to change them or make them unique, so you get a whole bunch of channels across the country whose news anchors read the same script.  


What makes this scary is the fact that it's a story about fake news, but if you check out [this similar compilation about holiday shopping](https://youtu.be/TM8L7bdwVaA) you realize it's not "fake news", trying to manipulate you, but rather, just "lazy news" that can't be bothered to alter the pre-written stories they buy. 
$C: Shout out to my city for being the first one in the video...I think...
$C: since the signing of ndaa, it is perfectly legal to air propaganda on mainstream media to its own citizens. think about that. fox, cnn etc, is one big tabloid paper.
$C: Democracy hahahahaha what a joke. True democracy only exists on the tv screens that of whitch are bought and owned by the same ppl who own these news stations 
$C: Democracy sounds weird.
$C: Lol GG America
$C: The new: *These pretzel’s are making me thirsty.*

*This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.*
$C: Haha we all make fun of China for being blatant with crowd control, but in reality we are just being controlled the same way, just with lies and the illusion we are more free.
$C: Oh Wow!  
- Owen Wilson.
$C: it was AP story...
$C: Stupid mother fuckers. We don't have a democracy because that would be 100% useless. We have a representative republic and thankfully so. Words matter. Definitions matter. 

This isn't just aimed at these robots but everyone else that says that shit. 
$C: The most disturbing thing from this video is the one lady only talking from one side of her mouth
$C: No, this is what happens when your government influences its own country's news/media outlets in the build up to and to subliminally justify and excuse military action
$C: Holy shit, that is some dystopian shit right there
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Soo creepy I couldn't make it all the way through.
$C: Well shit, that is terrifying. The propaganda of certain networks is already changing our country for the worse, but doing this to local news stations under the guise of local news is just fucking evil. The hypocrisy of them talking about things “dangerous to our democracy” is palpable. This country has gone to shit and I don’t see it turning around soon.
$C: Yes you’re right. This is extremely dangerous to our democracy!!
$C: The United States is a fucking joke full of brainwashed retards.
$C: Eh, the centralization of local media can be a bad thing, but I think this does a poor job of illustrating that. This is a fairly innocuous mission statement.
$C: What if we all chipped in and ran this video as a commercial on these stations, could they pull it or would they have to allow it since we bought the time?
$C: Money in politics:  Danger to our Democracy.  Money driven media:  Danger to our Democracy.  Money is dangerous to our Democracy when the majority of it is in so few hands.
$C: Just sent this to both of my parents, who still watch/believe the nightly news. It's infuriating that they're talking about the danger of fake, biased news--when that's what these stations have been pushing for decades. This is a desperate attempt at taking back the narrative. They're upset they've lost the ability to socially influence and brainwash an entire nation. 

THIS is fake. One of my best friend's sister is a news anchor for a fox affiliate. She's one of the dumbest people I've ever met. Her dream job was dishing dirt about popstars for TMZ. She's a nice person, but she is not an intelligent person. We put so much trust inherently in these news anchors, and really what they are, is bad actors who weren't talented or good looking enough to get into TV and movies. 
$C: Another consequence of voting for Trump.

His FCC will roll out the red carpet for Sinclair Group's acquisitions.
$C: This en-fucking-rages me
$C: I just threw up in my mouth a bit
$C: WOW!
$C: That was fucking freaky to watch. 
$C: This entire thread is not on the front page unless you sort by "hot"

Some major major manipulation is in play here to keep this off the front page for casual redditors.
$C: Omfg this is disturbing
$C: Not dangerous for our democracy, we live in a fascist police state so it's all good people. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Please tell me more about how american media is so much better than russian state-owned one and is propaganda-free.
$C: The alt right is the biggest cancer to this country. 
$C: This was so much worse than I thought, holy shit 
$C: what the fuck

somebody hold me
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: who knew a bunch of dump people were so easy to control.
$C: John Oliver did a [segment on Sinclair](https://youtube.com/watch?t=620s&v=GvtNyOzGogc) and I highly recommend it if this kind of thing feels extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: Doesn’t this break rule 1?
$C: The right has been complaining about media bias for decades and nobody gave a shit because their guys were pushing the narrative. 
When the right couldn’t change it they did what capitalists always do. They just did better at it than the competition.

No the left is crying foul because the media control is now about 50/50.

Oh knows muh 1984....

Welcome to the fight assholes. 
$C: Fuckin reposters
$C: So many silly people acting like Fox is the worst. This is why you're dumb. ALL OF THE NETWORKS ARE JUST AS BAD.
Just because you can't get passed your own biases doesn't mean your right.

$C: “Nah bra The internet hasn’t made local news largely irrelevant, thus crippling their advertising revenue, and forcing them to cut costs and operating expenses.

It’s clearly some vast right wing conspiracy to pipe in Russian propaganda news into every home!  Stay woke my bras!”
$C: Conan made this popular a few years ago. [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLXQ0qbq6jY). Was an old running segment.
$C: Donald Trump called it
$C: Dude I ate some shrooms earlier and this is totally tripping me out.
$C: This post is extremely dangerous for my Karma
$C: I don't think it's extremely dangerous to our democracy. It's just that there's no more money to be made in local news because nobody watches it, so they have to produce it as cheaply as possible and that means sharing writers across stations.
$C: Who the he'll still watches local evening news?  There can't be enough to support 4 of them in my city, can there?
$C: Corporations run the same script on multiple outlets to save costs. In other news, Walmart sells the same goods in multiple stores. What else is new?
$C: This isn't scary op. This just a copy and paste script that works for multiple news stations. It is supposed to sound cheesy. people just want to fearmonger over something
$C: Why is this surprising in the least bit???  Reddit at its finest
$C: Sounds like the mainstream media with the new drumpf talking point
$C: The video still showing here is excellent - purple lady on the right is hoping the poor little puppy can survive while the one on the left in black is thinking about eating the puppy's spleen.

$C: Because the truth is so obvious, they just happened to produce monologs within a narrow range of variation. Fake news like this youtube clip is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: This post has to be botted... The video doesn't even have 20k views yet
$C: I am guessing that because this is reddit that no one is going to point out that the left does the exact same thing?
$C: I’m extremely drunk and I can tell this is extremely drunk to our deco racy

$C: Conservatives are the real Deep State
$C: We gonna go after the Associated Press and their clients now?


$C: Sounds to me like a bunch of lazy producers copy pasting script because who'd notice the same one in two different markets. 
$C: So what you’re saying is...

NBC=FOX=CBS=ABC=NBC...

Illuminati Confirmed.
$C: If this many stations were spreading conspiracy theories or false stories or ignoring major news issues, then I could see it being an issue (and it is), but this video just has a bunch of stations giving a similar warning. A warning that is accurate. Telling people to be aware of fake news and media bias is a good move. It’s when those stations are doing what they’re warning about that it becomes a problem.
$C: Good job listening to our talking head news casters and hollywood actors, please don't forget to leave your guns at the door and vote for more immigrants to water down your vote and ensure our lasting power. Going online and thinking for yourself is dangerous to "Our" (not your) democracy.
$C: Dear USA,

$C: Fake news.
$C: “They’re following a script!”

You mean the people who’s job description is to read a script on camera?

If a news company is owned by a larger media company, they will get these internal memos which give direction on what to cover and how to cover it. 

There are tons of reasons that something like this could have happened that are entirely logical from a corporate perspective. 

First off we have the more fun to think of -but less likely malicious possibilities - taking bribe money to send a message that gets heard by a “reputable” source. To serve an agenda. Etc. 

Then we have the boring but realistic possibilities. Like a memo being sent out which explicitly states that they have to use that *exact* wording in order to cover their ass should there be any legal repercussions.

This is actually *extremely* common in the news business - and it’s becoming more common with privacy laws being more of a concern and the power of one person to make seemingly anything into a controversy. 

If this was some sort of deep state thing that’s meant to control the stupid, it wouldn’t be so obvious. The wording certainly wouldn’t be exactly the same (they would be explicitly told to manipulate the wording and to change the order of coverage). 

This is a funny video though, and it really sheds light on how inter-connected “local” news actually is. 


$C: John Oliver! Where art thou? We need you!
$C: Is it just me or were the last shots on green screen? Which begs to question are the rest of the news anchors even real?
$C: What are they raven talking about I couldn’t stand it after 3 sec
$C: Can someone explain to me why this is a bad thing? Asking for a friend.
$C: Proof?
$C: Chilling regardless of political affiliation. At first I thought this was just Fox, but I saw some ABC and CBS stations there. We need to tweet every single anchor who participated in this since their journalistic integrity is on the line.
$C: Lol this does not need a disturbing content tag 
$C: How is this "Disturbing Content?" I find it hilarious!
$C: Fucking hate it when I come to the comments to look at discussions and everyone is just like ThIs iS eXtReMeLy dAnGeRoUs To OuR dEmOcRaCy.

$C: >mainstream media constantly blasting stuff about muh russia muh election interference muh democracy threatened

>this video comes out

>these same people on reddit who eat MSM's junk up STILL find a way to bring russia and muh evil right wingers and how OUR DEMOCRACY IS AT RISK in

are you people actually braindead? democracy is a meaningless buzzword, MSM wants to limit social networks because it takes control away from central newa outlets, muh russia that these same anchors whine about is a controlled narrative. 
$C: What about the statement is everyone going on about?  I don't find anything about it to be controversial.  
$C: True... And when Obummer removes the restriction on government funded propaganda 6/2/2013. 
$C: This is a public statement made by the company.  It's common for 1 company to own several news outlets.  I guess I'm not seeing the problem here.
$C: You guys don't remember when CNN staged a rescue during hurricane Harvey? 
$C: Wow. It's almost as if your economic system permits this. And is therefore incompatible with democracy.
$C: i hear their point.  this is extremely dangerous for our democracy
$C: Meh, nothing wrong with this.
$C: I honestly don't understand why you guys are so up in arms over this? Yes, an extremely small % of people control the news... we've, uh, known that for years and done absolutely nothing about it. One of those companies is now coordinating a very transparent attack on... fake news.

It's scary that one company holds so much power over the media. It's also nothing new. It took 80 news anchors saying "fake news is bad" to wake you up to this, just now? They vaguely attack "MSM" for spreading false info. It's that attack that's Dangerous to Our Democracy? What else could they have done, said that all news are accurate but be aware of fake news anyway?

I'm not trying to be snarky or anything, just trying to understand.
$C: Trump is always right. Death to fake news. 
$C: Liberal media
$C: So it’s kinda like hundreds of newspapers running an article from the AP. 
$C: We're the only ones who tell the truth. Any other aspect or different pov is fake news and a danger to our democracy. You shall not listen to alternative sources, as they are without a doubt fake news. You only need us as we will tell you the truth. Obey!


First they came for your language, then for your culture, now for your guns and you retarded fucking normie cunts still think everyone who is sceptical is some x-files type of tinfoilhat conspiracy theorist. 

I remember being called a weird nerd and a conspiracy theorist when I warned people about facebook but they only listened when facebook became "like.. totally uncool omg lol" a week ago. 

This is why I fucking hate humanity. The majority of you disposable retards would fucking jump off a bridge if it became trendy.. go fucking die in your orwellian shitholes while name-calling people who warned you years ago. 
$C: So it's ok for CNN and Turner broadcasting to push their left agenda, but if a company pushes a right agenda, that's bad? Hmm, enjoy your echo chamber much?
$C: This is the stupidest shit I've seen in a while, gilded 43 times. Jesus christ.  
   
It makes sense for a news corporation to send out the same speech to all of its stations. Why would they not...why is this even note worthy at all?
$C: Oh no, a bunch of local stations read the same script telling people to fact check their news. 

I am *literally shaking*. What's next? The government putting out PSA's about how smoking is bad for you? 

Look at how outraged and disturbed I am, please!
$C: Wow a corporation with locations all over the country wanted to make a national statement and wrote a script for their anchormen, all news must be fake, the media must be controlled, corporations must be taking over, wake up people! Jeez that's a shocker, next you're gonna tell me snapchat sends all of us the same holiday snaps instead of customized ones for each of us. Scary times we live in.

$C: Good thing we arent a democracy then, right?
$C: I think the mainstream with the exact same scripted talking points is more dangerous to our democracy
$C: Easily the most effective protest I've seen in a long while.
$C: So basically everything they're saying applies to themselves mostly. Especially the ones sitting in front of a FOX logo.

EDIT: meaning THEY have the real biases and fake news propaganda so it's ironic.
$C: Who watches local news anymore besides old people and trump supporters? I don’t think I’ve watched local news in 10 years.
$C: https://imgur.com/a/zmqoB  

The alt-left is no different. CNN, MSNBC, CBS, ABC, BBC, HuffPo, WaPo...other side of the same coin.  

Bezos owns Amazon and WaPo. Amazon has a $500M contract with the CIA. Don't see anyone having issues with this. 
$C: Wow. I’m scared
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: If you’re going to call out Fake News, then call out the one who propagates it the most: Donald Trump. 
$C: This must be that liberal news I keep hearing about. /s
$C: Ehhh... while I have zero love for Fox, what exactly do you want them to do? They own a lot of media and this seems like a way to express the issue of fake news in a broad scope. 
$C: You're just figuring this out now?  What's the next case you're going to crack?  Who shot JFK?
$C: This video is stupid. 
$C: Implying the left wing doesn't do the same thing zzz
$C: They all pushed for Hillary too
$C: Rawrrrrr 
$C: God damn 20 gold. And ill never see one..
$C: The POTUS was right all along.
$C: I see many of the commenters here have never watched different liberal news programs,, on different news channels in which the many liberal defenders spout the same comments word for word. Kind of like they all got the same memo.
Hypocrites.

$C: Can someone tell me who’s controlling them (other then the democrats)
$C: It almost seems as if the MSM knows people aren't buying their shit.
$C: This really doesn’t bother me. Nothing they said is something I or most people would disagree with. As long as stories stay factual and local. Than what’s the issue?

The national news channels are a disgrace these days. 
$C: Jews.
$C: Rush Limbaugh has clips like this on a weekly basis which point out how all the mainstream media are operating from the same marching orders.
$C: I was actually in Belarus (Russia's little brother) when I realized our whole media sphere was controlled. Just to see real news on their TV compared to NBC, BBC, Fox, etc.... and it was obvious who was lying.

That was back when Ukraine was having their "revolution", which was actually a US-backed coup covered up by western media. People are dying due to this media deception. This is how they covered up 9/11. JFK. Whew..

I'm constantly asking my Russian friend for "real" information. Our science, our education, our medical system.. it's all fucked.

$C: They're not wrong and it's good to see news stations take a clear stand against fake news. Don't understand all the outrage. Yeah it was scripted, because they want to use a shared message to drive home their point. 

Very telling that those who are most opposed to people taking a stand against fake news come from the far-right...

EDIT: Downvote me fine, but tell me why I am wrong. The hivemind here is strong.
$C: I know I'm getting ganked for saying this, but why does this upset people so much? It is pretty much what FOX affiliates have been doing for a decade at least for all news. Or any national news station. 

Here they are just reading out a common statement, and because it is read word for word it scares people? The same news have already been delivered accross multiple programs. 
$C: Obviously what your implying is to fuckin have these guys hanged because they have no regard for human life... Would that make you feel better?  What is your business model to ensure this wont happen again?  And do you honestly feel like every human is as virtuous as you?  Why should we trust your word vs others?
$C: Not sure why tradition is suddenly news....?
$C: It's a shame too, because what they're saying isn't untrue
$C: For the last time THIS ISNT A FUCKING DEMOCRACY! Never has never will be. It's a republic. Democracy is the root of true evil, it screws over minority's.
$C: From the last time something like this was posted, this is a result of a slow news day. There are businesses out there who gather stories like this to distribute and sell to small news stations. The local news stations take stories from them when the news is slow. You can call it laziness on the stations part to not change the writing, but this has nothing to do with the parent company. 
$C: Trump was right....again! 
$C: Its a good script. Effective, punctual, and communicates the point clearly.

I see no issue with news outlets using the same phrases or scripts if they are trying to convey the same point.

Reddit with its fear mongering again.
$C: We are going to lose more and more rights and freedoms every day that the Republicans have power. This is unprecedented and, dare I say it, dangerous to our democracy.

Drag them *all* out of office every chance you can.
$C: Ummm, hate to be a voice of dissent here, but I don't think this alone is as problematic as people are taking it. The message they are saying is 100% correct. Impartiality and proper sourcing IS extremely important, and all stations should be making a point of it, and asking their viewers to hold them to that standard. 

Yes, it is worrisome that all these channels appear to be owned by one entity, but the message being conveyed here is objectively good and unbiased. When multiple of these channels start pushing for the same political agenda is when there is a problem.

Edit: I was definitely wrong - http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/04/media/sinclair-producer-resigns-protest/index.html
$C: Really tough, this is just knee jerk reactionary nonsense. Why would you expect a national statement to vary on each station? If the company bought an ad and played it everywhere in the country no one would notice. 
$C: Guys, guys, guys. Holy shit, uhm. Fuck. Did you guys know. Oh shit. Did you know that many individual TV stations are owned by, get this, *the same company*??? Fuck, fuck, fuck. And they are, my god, airing conservative viewpoints? 

How widespread is this and how can it be stopped??
$C: News flash. Most small stations are owned by a larger conglomerate. This is no different than McDonald’s issuing a new burger at their restaurants. 
$C: All MSM sources are biased, not just fox news.
$C: The same company doesn't own all of those stations. The more likely situation is that some business who specialises in social media has writren a press release and suggested copy for the anchors to read and no one changed the copy.
$C: Trump was right....

Here’s another video
https://youtu.be/GsrpAdSEE80

This scripting was used so hard in the election

$C: It’s incredibly amusing watching a bunch of redditors (99.9%) liberal, complaining about media bias. Truly rich 
$C: In 2016 there were 1780 commercial tv stations in the US.  I bet you don't mind if they are liberal owned and operated right?   Competition is good lefties, I know you hate it when your monopolies are threatened.  Ya get all skurd.

$C: Cnn is fake news 

Has anyone seen the 1990s documentary “feed” and “spin”. It give a good insight on how msm plays a huge role in manipulating public opinion politics 
$C: If you're upset at this but not the MSM which is almost exclusively owned by a small group of left wing extremists, then you're a hypocrite. 
$C: I'm really confused. What's the problem here? It's just a bunch of news stations giving a public statement. I understand the problem with many news stations being owned by the same company, but this video is not showcasing how these stations cover the news at all. What am I missing?
$C: [deleted]
$C: Why is this disturbing? That's like saying 'oh wow, the Winnie the Pooh ride in Disney World is IDENTICAL to the one in Disney Land!'

If I own a bunch of news stations, I'll naturally have them publish the same if not different material. That's like saying that NPR reports the SAME story on different radio stations although it all comes from say the same show, (i.e. All Things Considered).

So please explain, what's disturbing about this?
$C: Well, we should realize that this makes, at worst, a fifth choice in local markets.  ABC, NBC, CBS, and FOX, all have local affiliates.  Why does the presence of Sinclair make it so sinister?

Also, if Sinclair were broadcasting things that people didn’t want to see, people wouldn’t watch, advertisers wouldn’t pay to advertise, and the stations would go out of business.

What the Left genuinely can’t understand, and this happened with Fox too, is that there is a market for what Sinclair is selling.  Liberals see a threat, and want to shut it down.


$C: So... weird question here...

why is multiple stations saying the same thing to smaller groups of thousands of people any more eyebrow raising than one nationally sydicated personality giving a single message to millions...?

the fact that people are freaking out about this video just proves how dumb we are as a nation...
$C: And just like that, Reddit dislikes the media again

Right?
$C: LAME!  
Editorials and promos are the done the SAME on all networks. This is **NOT** a news story- fake *or* real. It's an "Opinion Piece" and that's how these are run... on all owned stations.
$C: oh my God, a nation wide TV network of stations that share content.

This is completely...ordinary.
$C: I don’t really understand what is so wrong about this. News is entertainment, it will be owned by a large company and standardized across many markets like this. I take all news, local and national, with a huge grain of salt. It’s all biased and is for profit. News should be taken as a data point to figure out what is going on, not as a fact 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Did no one even listen to what they were saying? It was extremely unbiased true. 
$C: Cable and radio are scripted, that’s always been true. You’re not forced to watch or listen to any of this. So why are libtards getting so hysterical?
$C: Yeah so ? The Left has been doing this for years. 

I have seen numerous cuts of CNN / CBS / NBC saying the exact same lines and the exact same phrasing -- Same with print media. 

Glad to see you people finally getting red pilled about the mainstream media
$C: /r/im14andthisisdeep


$C: Now I don't mean to be 'that person', but we've been pointing stuff like this out on r/The_Donald for a long time now.
$C: This is politics.  Politics isn't allowed on this sub.
$C: Fuck this video and most of these comments. I read comments before watching the video and was expecting some scary one sided message and waht I got was news stations covering the legit major story about how social media is spreading false news to influence us. It is in fact a threat to our democracy. Sorry they didn't use a thesaurus geeze.
$C: What's wrong with one group of people controlling the media? This thread is getting dangerously antisemitic.
$C: This has already been the case for years, but they all leaned left, no one cared until a right leaning company started owning a few. 

I guess another positive coming out of the trump presidency. Forcing the left to look at the massive media bias they hold. 
$C: So... let me get this straight. A company, who actually doesn't report garbage ass fake news, but calls it out, being consistent, is a problem? So would you guys rather they lie and create garbage like the other news companies? Please explain, with intelligence.
$C: Jesus Christ haven't you guys gotten tired of this shit yet? The economy is doing well, more jobs have come back, but because people think le cheeto says mean things on Twitter they have to scream that he's evil every moment of every day. Give it a rest for God's sake. This includes the media and just citizens. Calm tf down for once. You aren't some magical anti-Republican gladiator. You're just one of those dudes that retweets anti-Trump stuff on your twitter account.

$C: Sorry, what's wrong with this, exactly?

They're all saying the same words, handed down from a central command that is funding their local journalism. They also probably present local news that is fairly accurate and, most of all, accountable.

Reddit would prefer a world in which totallytruenewsdotcom.ru just runs "Obummer Murders 19 People While Trump Saves Babies" and commands equal time and attention with *corporate, capitalist* news because "hey, it might be true! And it's better than *Haliburton* and other *corporations* controlling what I think!"

Bunch of fucking babies.
$C: And the liberal bias is on every other channel. 
$C:  Let’s say a guy named Bob was to walk into a room and pick a flower from a vase, squirt it with a squirt gun from his pocket and then proceed to eat said flower and then strolled from the room. 

Then you tasked 20 people to each talk about what just happened for several minutes at a time, is it possible that you might get a lot of repeating phrases, descriptions from one person to the next? 
$C: You left out ABC 33/40 in Birmingham.
$C: I saw ABC 13 which is Houston
$C: Are these all Sinclair stations? FCC wants to eliminate laws that limit media monopolies. 
$C: Wow, this comment is currently trending as most controversial.

Someone with a botnet doesn't like all this information being shared it seems...
$C: This is great, thank you! With the nice formatting too.

Edit: And the updates!
$C: The video is just a sampling, right? Sinclair has a lot more stations than that.
$C: That's not even close to the full list of Sinclair owned stations
$C: “This is extremely dangerous to our democracy” is an excellent example of funny - not funny - then funny again. Well done youtuber. 
$C: They have the same message as CNN and the DNC; "don't listen to alternate news online. only listen to us. they are a threat to our democracy". 

You are trying to spin this as a Republican/conservative problem. Be honest. 
$C: I'm disappoint in Frank Coletta
$C: I thought KOMO in Seattle was sin-Clair s well?

Can’t we boycott them and their advertisers?
$C: I thought it was just one state but different cities. Scary shit
$C: It used to be worse - Viacom used to own everything - radio stationa, movie companies, tv channels and newspapers.

The government didn't stop it or intervene.

The internet made it less profitable so they had to sell some (not all) of their holdings.
$C: oh fucking great, they got rochester
$C: Well, I’m no longer watching KUTV SLC. 
$C: Fuck me no wonder this sounded familiar my hometown is on that list
$C: Kutv is the CBS affiliate for Salt Lake City. 

Edit: whoops. Didn't see it on the list initially but it was there all along.  Ignore me please. 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Interesting to note that almost all of those are in predominantly Republican states. Could be nothing, but it almost seems like they have a target audience.
$C: Heres an updoot!
$C: OP, I have an explanation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/88ll08/this_is_what_happens_when_one_company_owns_dozens/dwm84ze/) regarding WGWW for Alabama - you may want to change it to WBAM/WSES/WGWW - the BHM market only knows it as primarily WBMA now that WSES and WGWW merged into WBMA.
$C: Which one was the eastern Iowa?
$C: And there's my city... Oh man..
$C: You have Cedar Rapids, IA twice. Very good list though.
$C: Motherfucker. My local news station is on there.
$C: Thanks Bob.
$C: WTTE Fox 28 - Columbus Ohio  Timestamp 1:36
$C: You have a KATV in Little Rock. There's one in Rapid City, SD too. Not sure if that matters. I'm surprised there aren't more of these Sinclair stations in SD. 
$C: Could we get someone to close this into each of those cities to make people aware?
$C: Thank you for compiling this. I kind of feel like we also need a list of all of the presenters reading the script, as no "journalist" should willingly read that trash
$C: So I guess if you can watch any of these outlets.

DONT.
$C: Wow
$C: John Oliver did a great piece on Sinclair that talks about this exact thing. Go check it out. 
$C: Oh good, none of them near me. It means I dont have to worry about this. ill just be going back to laughing at cat gifs. /s

$C: which software  did you use to edit this and arrange everything with synchronisation..great work ..
$C: Damn David Gonzalez, why you gotta do your people like that. 
$C: The USA is NOT a democracy.  The USA is a republic. Republic meaning Ruled By Law.  We are ruled and our government is restricted in power by laws.  A democracy is mob rule.  The word democracy does not appear in the constitution or the constitutions of any of the 50 states.  We are NOT a democracy.  Calling us a democracy is a mind-game to make you related democracy with Democrat.  Guess you can call it the original fake news of the Democrat party...
$C: Nah my local news says it's fine
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.

$C: It's literally fake news, Trump was right all along.
$C: [removed]
$C: It's completely expected in a capitalist state. Businesses will absorb each other until only a handful exist and control everything.
$C: If John Oliver was talking about it a year ago, it's probably an issue today, yes.
$C: I don't even watch TV news anymore - it's usually depressing and they don't even do feel-good stories anymore (correlation?). Maybe *Frontline* if it's an interesting topic, but I mostly stick to cartoons and cooking shows on broadcast TV
$C: On a scale of 1 to 10, how much do you want to know?
$C: Joke's on them, I haven't watched the local news in at least 20 years.
$C: yes
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.

$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy 
$C: You have the most upvoted comment on the top reddit post of all time in my subreddit list. nice.
$C: It's extremely dangerous to our democracy 
$C: This is a danger to our democracy
$C: Dangerous question there...
$C: Checkout the Associated Press.
$C: your free thinking is extremely dangerous to our democracy 
$C: No, it isn't. Is it an issue if everybody picks up a local paper and reads the same AP article that another local paper also purchased? You're allowing idiots like the person that made this video think for you. There are certainly things in the media that are worth changing, but reading purchased copy isn't one of them. It would disturb me more if they actually tailored the story to each locale. 
$C: Yes, the issue is no one wants to talk about neo nazi propagaNDA 
$C: A much bigger deal than net neutrality, IMO.
$C: [It's been around for years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44ojS4UNn8I). Don't believe the [fake news.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM8L7bdwVaA) But you may continue to blame Ajit Pai.
$C: Sinclair owning a lot of stations might be an issue.  Them telling all their stations to record a PSA about fake news and giving them a script isn’t.
$C: No, it’s a fantastic business model and we’re going to be rich.
$C: Well it's not not an issue.
$C: I studied abroad in Russia in 2004.  When I saw the military propaganda on Russian TV, I realized we did the same thing.  We are way better than Russia, but we still do a lot of creepy stuff.
$C: I participate in every election, I look to see what I’m voting on while I’m in line and I research it so I know what I’m voting on, but other than that I completely and totally avoid the news.

I don’t get the newspaper or any magazines. I don’t have cable. I don’t have local tv. I don’t have social media other than reddit and I have most of the news/political subreddits blocked. I have a pi-hole so I don’t get stupid ads either.

This has done so much to help with my depression and well-being, it’s incredible. I’ll talk about the news if someone mentions something to me, but other than that, I don’t care. I read the text of what I’m voting on and I form my own opinion without anyone trying to influence how I should feel one way or another and I go back to my life.

I will vote on everything, all the way down to the minor elections for my HOA (That’s how we got comcrap kicked out.) But so much of the news is just fluff junk and I’m tired of spending two hours to get enough information to piece together the two sentences of what a bill contains. I’ll just read the bill myself. I have too much shit to do to listen to you ask someone about their day. Senator so-and-so being jet lagged isn’t news. I don’t care how their day is. I don’t care that they’re having trouble passing something because of insert excuse here. 

The news surrounds everything with so much crap, it no longer educates, it distracts. You don’t know what XYZ bill contains, but that steely eyed gorgeous son of a bitch sounded like it was bad and compared it to other bad things so it must be bad! That’s not “educating yourself on the issues.” Going online and reading the actual contents, THAT is educating yourself on the issues. And it’s a lot less stressful.
$C: I actually feel less depressed watching this. It confirms all those crazy thoughts one has about the media. It makes me angry seeing this, and I’m excited to share it going forward
$C: Burn it the fuck down. 
$C: Regulation and legislation. This type of thing is outlawed in other first world countries. Sinclair, one company, should not be allowed to own the majority of local stations in this country.
$C: Well, Marx had some good ideas a while ago
$C: I mean, there are a few ways out. They just end with most people dead or brutalized. 
$C: Get money out of politics and break up these handful of corporations that own everything, if that is done things will get much better since just about every issue that people have with our country is in someway related to this disgusting corruption. Please go out and vote for good people, because otherwise this will never change because the corporations that benefit from this bullshit use that money to keep the system the way it is and unless we start getting principled people in Congress you can expect things to stay the same.
$C: I know what you mean, this whole country is so fucked.

Really makes me consider blowing my brains as in there truly is no hope for our future and future generations.
$C: It wasn't happening on this scale in this way. Sinclair's expansion is a concerted effort to transform US news into state propaganda.
$C: Stop paying them to produce it, that's a good first step.  Money actually becomes the solution, not the problem.
$C: Support independent news outlets - local public radio is a great place to start.
$C: This is my exact feeling right now.
Even if I try to fight it I know there is no chance we as a society could change our destructive way
$C: If life was a computer game I would load up a saved game some 20000 years ago.
$C: Stop watching and start reading long form essay journalism. 
$C: Stop watching the news. Boom you just created less demand for it.
$C: Capitalism has to die. I'm not saying socialism or communism is the way. I have no idea, I'm not smart enough. But capitalism has destroyed societies and left us with this really sick, cruelly competitive world we live in. 
$C: Enough people must resist with force. Sorry, but that's the only viable option. Ordinary people must collaborate and organize to fight together or this will only worsen.
$C: Non-profit journalism. Transparent, public finances. Public communication records. Ban anything that claims to be a source of news and seeks to turn a profit.
$C: Make different choices.
$C: This isn't even surprising. I know reddit is largely anti-gun and I'll be downvoted for this, but this type of shit is the norm for all mainstream media. Just watch the amount of times they repeat the phrases "military style assault weapons", "weapons of war", "nobody needs an ar-15 to hunt", etc, etc. There's a common script that just gets hammered over and over again.
$C: > I don't see a way out of this cash fueled system of ours. 

If you think cash is the problem here, you are misled by a lot of people. This is not due to cash and would happen in any society which is turning authoritarian.
$C: Quite terrifying really
$C: Easy.  Turn off the TV.   Read the news.
$C: Vote. Get the corrupt politicians out of office. That is by far the most we ordinary people can do. 
$C: I remember this from a few years ago. It's OK you can admit it..... https://youtu.be/TM8L7bdwVaA
$C: Don't listen to any corporate run media. Fox, CNN, NBC, ABC, etc. None of it. Boycott all of it and don't believe a word they say.
$C: Its harmful, you can tell when people consume todays cable network media they are so dumbed down. Mostly old city types, terrified a Russian Nazi is coming to get them.
$C: According to Star Trek it'll all be considered moot once the nukes wipe most government s out and we miraculously break warp speed and meet aliens.

Well it's either that or nuclear winter ravishes all civilization pretty much factory resetting mankind like fallout or madmax...
$C: Just don't watch it.
$C: A way could be like here in Denmark. Some of our channels are "free" to everyone, because everyone pays a TV license every month. This means they don't have to compete with views or anything. It really shines through when watching the news. It's news. No add on. 
The only downside is that all the other content can get pretty boring, because again. They don't have to compete. 
$C: I disagree,  I think we are closer than ever..
Egypt, Rome...bitcoin
$C: Until we get rid of the cash that is. Everyone 
sees the problem is money, even the Bible had it right about greed and money. Yet here we are. Funny how people pick and choose what to believe.

One day I'm confident we will finally realize money is a joke and just start helping each other for the incentive of the human race surviving, not personal gain
$C: Dying, thats about it. No one can agree on objective truth because of their biases and shit they have been fed. Even though facts tend to have a left lean, people never admit when they are wrong and even the "good" people have hidden agendas. The way out of this hell is death. 
$C: Decentralized Currency.  Decentralized everything!  Blockchain is the future that will save us. 
$C: Military rule is the only real option. It is practically impossible to rise up the ranks as a criminal. They will get caught, and the military will fuck them hard.

Watch The Mechanism on Netflix, it details the corruption in Brazil. Brazil went corrupt as soon as Military passed over rule to "democracy". All the political parties of any ideology are all in on it. The March of Tyranny is real, and no doubt it is the same here in America (Brazil learned from us), and probably every other country.

We are cattle to these people, and they  know every trick in the book to sway our opinion. We gave them even more info and power by using social media. They're even responsible for putting the idea in your head that military rule would be terrible. 

But it is either that or just accept you will be ruled by corruption forever. Voting really doesn't help, all the parties are corrupt. If you vote a few "good" individual outsiders in they will just get marginalized bogged down with process or criminalized somehow so they are powerless or get blackmailed into  playing along with the corruption.

Shit like the Reign of Terror after the French Revolution sounds very bad from an abstract universal morality, but the reality is that if you want a just government then a lot of people in power have to disappear for good. They won't just politely go into the night.
$C: Yeah, I hear it’s extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I hear tell it's extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Look up the Bell internet censorship story in Canada. The giant media companies want to censor the Internet but no one except the government run CBC has really done major reporting on it because every tv or radio station, or newspaper company in Canada is either owned at least partly by the Bell Media group or other oligarchy giants in Canada or receives major advertising funds from the giants. The Bell Media Group and Rogers basically run all of Canada's media and have absurd power

Biggest story on r/canada the past month is in regards to their planned legislation but also advocacy groups blacklisted from advertising/reporting on the issue. They can basically only advertise the issue on independently run university run radio stations because of how much power the media giants have in Canada 
$C: The purchase.of media by Sinclair broadcasting is scarier.
$C: Not to downplay the importance of this in televised news but I really hate what it's done to local radio stations.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: I was incredibly dissapointed when the Australian senate got rid of its media ownership laws that aimed to restrict a companies reach to 75% of the population.
$C: That’s because small media companies can’t compete because people won’t pay them. What people say they want is different than what they purchase.
$C: Theres a war on for your mind!
$C: Radio was standarized so long ago by iHeartRadio media, but people are so wary of scary regulations when their point was to prevent this.
$C: The standardization of the media is a very scary thing.
$C: standardization is incorrect. deregulation is what happened and it happened under Bill Clinton
$C: When you control what people know, you control what they think. 
$C: I totally agree. We need competition and differentiation in mass media. As soon as possible. 
$C: Generally speaking, media today is as diverse as it has ever been in this history of the human race. That said, the acquisitions of Sinclair are alarming.
$C: Yes, news should not come from one source only, or mostly for that matter. On the other hand, news should be as neutral and objective as possible. This would make a lot of different sources report the news in a similar way (of course not as extreme as this), thus homogenizing it. It’s a fine line. Today, in the US, I feel the news is almost exclusively reported either in a ‘conservative’  or a ‘liberal’ way, polarizing people more than necessary.
$C: I don't think standardization is the right word. Our media should have standards - of quality, sourcing, impartiality, etc. Homogeny isn't the greatest though.
$C: > *standardization*
consolidation. 

At this rate, all media will be owned by a single parent company in the next decade or so. Same with the large tech companies and isps. 


$C: That doesn't sound like a team player attitude.
$C: The term the socialists would use is the massification of media. Easier to create false consciousness across broad swaths of the population.
$C: [Thanks, Obama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIevazPIPzU)
$C: The ~~standardization~~ propagandization of the media is a very scary thing. 

 FTFY
$C: More scary than the world of endless danger that is the yang to the ying of lottery winning. 

News is and always will be a way of viewing another's opinion, it's both a gift and detrimental in portraying life around us. News is as good as you make it, some negate the facts and believe in a flat earth - some negate facts and believe in a group of flat earth believers misunderstanding a human achievement.

Repetition for monetary sake isn't a shortfall, if the news portrayed a localised disaster instead, it would be seen in a different light.

Billions, millions, I for one would enjoy a fact based news show curated to me - sadly if that were an option I would then branch out to self affordability of such news team. 

Life is what you make it, news is what was made for life. 
$C: Stop watching and start reading long form essay journalism. 


$C: Its a thing in all popular media. Newspapers reprint articles licensed from news agencies like AP and Reuters but in that case it's not necessarily a bad thing because it is the journalist itself that gets credited in the byline. Radio has syndicated shows and music playlists that the parent company licenses. Record labels and songwriters market multiple artists and standardize their music, not always a bad thing in this case because the art doesn't always suffer. Super hero movies all recycle the same assets over multiple films so they're essentially standardized. ESRB ratings standardize content by defining which market your media targets based on it's guidelines.

It's been a thing on television media for a long time, but now with politically charged news in the US it's a potential vehicle for the parent companies to influence dialogue. This potential is super creepy when it's put together in a single video.
$C: Looks like my facebook news feed when a major events happens.
$C: it's common core aimed at seniors.
$C: No, neo nazis propaganda is a scary thing.
$C: Bill Clinton 1996
$C: The alt-right Nazification of American media is indeed scary.
$C: I avoid pretty much all forms of media now. Especially CNN, MSNBC, and Fox. Even local stations.

Excluding Reddit. Which itself arguably has a defacto Liberal or neo-progressive bias overall. Or special interest groups propping it up or having shills manipulate the discussions.

And I don't consider myself a Liberal or a Conservative. At least not in the sense of how polarized we have become.
$C: This is why us older left wingers don't like Clinton Democrats.


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996
$C: I’m going to disagree, fragmentation of media has likely done more to harm American social harmony and increase political polarization in the United States than a great many forces. 

We’re at a point where political discussion is impossible because we can’t even get groups to agree on a baseline of what the facts of the matter are. With everyone consuming the same or similar media like back in the days of print and the big three stations, there’s more consensus on what’s actually going on. 
$C: so stop watching it
$C: I'm bothered by all of these anchors going along with this. To my knowledge, none of them have pushed back on spreading propaganda. 
$C: Thanks, Bill Clinton.

$C: In my local market (Boston) there was a story on the local news about how the supermodel-wife of a certain quarterback has a "guilty pleasure" and that it is (insert name of donut company) donut bites, how she can't resist them, blah blah blah. It got MINUTES of coverage and banter by the anchors.

The same day, the Boston Globe puts a similar story on the front page.

Commentators deride the whole mess as an example of how sad the state of affairs is in area journalism, but nobody says a fucking word about how obvious a PR campaign it was and how the ad agency for said donut company is apparently able to push whatever it wants onto both the evening news and the front page of the region's largest newspaper.

Did I mention that the donut bites are tasteless stale cardboard with barely any flavor, because they keep cheapening them?

I clearly remember the same news program, a couple of months ago, covering the donut company's product lineup changing. It was basically "AND IN OTHER NEWS! Fuckin Donuts has released a new flavored beverage!" They spend almost a full minute rambling on about it.

$C:  The Glitch Mob,  right? Of course,  the actual "lyric" deals with sound obviously, but I still like the reference :)
$C: There is honestly nothing wrong with what we just watched.

It was a corporate PR message sent to all their stations.  Of course it’s going to be the same thing being read by everyone.

If it were news stories we were seeing it would be something else.  This tho is more internet hysteria over nothing.
$C: > Well that was ~~creepy as fuck~~ ***extremely dangerous to our Democracy.***
$C: I feel like this is one of those rare "gems" that shows up on Reddit,  exposes some shining truth about how the media is completely controlled, how there are daily initiatives to do the same with online/social media from Reddit, to Facebook etc.  and before anything of substance is gained from the conversation.  A million users suddenly show up and downvote everything, or the thread just gets straight up deleted.
#Edit: Locked on queue.  Can't have Reddit turning away from the blind shilling of /r/worldnews and /r/politics and realise everything they hear about US politics from the media is completely fabricated?  Anyone else remember when Reddit allowed organic discussion rather than just locking and deleting everything that exited the constraints of the mods' political beliefs?
$C: There's only one way it would have been even creepier. If at the end, they all got quiet, and the in unison shouted NEXT!
$C: It's funny how stuff that was straight up crazy conspiracy theory stuff a couple of decades ago is accepted fact now. I read r/conspiracy all the time for reasons like this. A lot of stuff is way off and incredible, but some of it is spot on and cutting edge. There are things I was telling my parents nearly 10 years ago that made them think I was crazy, like that facebook would cause large scale depression among users, that is now clear as day. 
$C: The next suggested video on YouTube is pretty good also.
$C: [I tried to find more Nixon](https://youtu.be/eNxycOyfdaQ?t=82)
$C: War is peace 
$C: /u/Drexelhand got gold and way more upvotes than you by piggybacking off of **YOUR** comment.

I am just rubbing that in.
$C: It sounded like a company reading a prepared statement to me.
$C: It was especially creepy as fuck seeing the news anchors from my own area featured in that.
$C: Why?
$C: how was this figured out?? Serious question. im looking for this answer and I don't see it?
$C: It’s the real life equivalent to “no u r”
$C: Yep...
$C: That said, better that they deliver that message than not, right?
$C: It's only creepy if you don't watch the full video. [It was put together in order to ask viewers to report their local news station if they're producing biased or sensationalized stories.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBlZCeRMRyY) This is non-politically good thing to do. Sinclair owns hundreds of local stations and they don't want these stations producing fake news. 
$C: WE ARE THE BORG
$C: And then it really freaking you out when it goes to single stations and your "trusted" news team for the past twenty years is reading it with their best fake concerned faces.
$C: I had a good laugh at the willies, but let's not also forget the nillies, too, ok?
$C: Talking heads would be better, because most people at least understand they have a bias.

These are anchors, I believe. To a large segment of the population the local news anchors are the first and last word.
$C: Would you like one more? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
$C: It felt exactly like a scene out of a movie. 

Fucking love that feeling.
$C: When all the talking heads were speaking at once I got the willies
$C: When all the talking heads were speaking at once I got the willies
$C: When all the talking heads speak at once, democracy dies.
$C: Media Nazi propaganda
$C: I got a willie ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
$C: Yea sort of like realizing that all these news pundits are just drones, and Sinclair is the queen.  And we are the food...
$C: [deleted]
$C: It's a Black Mirror episode... oh wait. :(
$C: That’s weird; I got the sams.
$C: Would you like to know more?
$C: I was thinking...  he probably got like 5 voice overs but put some 30 videos there for bigger effect...  and as if the author knew what people would think, one by one they were shown to really say that.
$C: Whistlin Willie
$C: Willies hears ya...Willies doesn’t care. 
$C: Does....Does anyone know where I can get a pair of those special sunglasses?
$C: This is scary as ass.
$C: The future is certain, give us time to work it out. 
$C: “If we don’t control you, who else will?”
$C: Same
$C: I got the heebie-jeebies.
$C: What a bunch of lifeless zombies!!!
$C: It was an amazing effect.  It had this unearthly feel to it.
$C: I'm curious what the other news person said following the line about dangerous democracy.


$C: It would be neat if one of you guys could build a robot to tweet this video at all the news anchors in this video. One of them would likely slip up and respond.
$C: Attention all planets of the solar federation, we have assumed control.
$C: AMA request with some of those talking heads
$C: Seriously...that creeped me the fuck out
$C: And all the same pace. Is that TV news training? Is it a video sent to the stations with instruction to "read it like this?"
$C: We all did
$C: This was fantastically edited. 
$C: How many people under 40 watch the local news?  
$C: Glad it wasn't just me....haha
$C: I Just want to say that this IS dangerous to our democracy.  And BOTH SIDES take part in this.  The fact is that the people that want to sway public opinion know that if people hear the same phrase in a certain context, consciously and subconsciously, it begins to ring true for them.  It's pure propaganda and manipulation.  

[This is just one example in a virtual ocean of examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6u7d4Z_Kek) you can find online of both Dems and Repubs taking part in this behavior.  Frankly, I have no idea what we could do about it.  The only thing we can do is call them on their shit.  

Don't believe for a second that only one side or the other is doing this.  
$C: Like penis willies? R/nohomo
$C: When every copy of the NYTimes and the the London Times [even the translated ones] had the same ad from Mark Zuckerberg, I got the willies...

Seriously though, what is so harmful about warning about fake news like Pizzagate et al in every media market? Do you WANT large corporations to ignore such things just because they own small properties instead of single large ones?
$C: Sack up.
$C: You're living it.
$C: No.  We are in Black Mirror.  Someone outside is watching us. 
$C: It’s also kinda reminiscent of Mr.Robot
$C: ANYONE
$C: I wish 
$C: Reminds me of the Electric Dreams episode *Kill All Others*"
$C: Black Mirror is watching you.
$C: [removed]
$C: [removed]
$C: You're living it...
$C: You talking about the nonsensical response or the video we just watched?

I don’t understand why people are freakin our over a corporate PR message that was sent to all their stations.
$C: its like the borg 
$C: I'm pointing this out in a secon thread /u/endless_thread,  please address this in a podcast
$C: This life is a lie 
$C: I would upvote you 1,000 for this comment if I could. 
$C: Can someone explain what this is? I get multiple stations read the same script but why is it a big deal? Thanks. 
$C: Are we living in the Waldo moment?
$C: Welcome to the real world 
$C: Black? More like a white mirror

50 plus stations featured in the clip and only 1 minority anchor 
$C: Check out the program in China for rating Citizens, now that’s black mirror ..
$C: You are the  vacuum..
$C: Based on a true story
$C: You’re living it!!
$C: "This is extremely dangerous to our democracy"

This is the sound of the point being driven home by a 20 pounds sledgehammer.
$C: yea for real. syncing up all that video and audio is impressive
$C: The La Li Lu Le Lo will make sure this will get buried. 
$C: Timothy Burke, Managing Editor at Deadspin. You can find him on Twitter @bubbaprog.

$C: Conan did this 4 years ago.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM8L7bdwVaA

Edit: Also did it 5 years ago and there are a number of other ones he's done 2 years back, 3 years back, etc.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o9x-yDyN78
$C: that ending is fucking GOLD
$C: There's a Deadspin logo in the bottom right.
$C: Deadspin staff. 
$C: The same company(sinclair) did a multi-billion dollar deal with trump's fcc chair to ensure the death of net neutrality. They are going to make the internet in to a right wing propaganda fever dream.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: ***"This video is extremely dangerous to our hypocrisy!"***
$C: I have to think they are somebody who works in journalism, otherwise it's tough for local people to realization that their local station is parroting what some other local station a state away. A journalist might be required to keep an eye on "the competition"
$C: Would you like to know more?
$C: I shared this to my cities subreddit (San Antonio) when I saw this video as Sinclair own two stations (fox,nbc) out of the big news broadcast networks(abc,cbs) I also just realized as of writing this they also own the CW (which does not have a news show afaik)

Everyone’s reaction is pretty much in disbelief that they are like a machine feeding the same line to their viewers.
I was Surprised that a local station couldn’t even take their own spin on the message.
I wish the other networks would at least report of this one video alone.
$C: Do you know if each "this was extremely dangerous to our democracy" clip at the end was from the same monologue? Crazy shit!
$C: Professional, even. And in about seven days. 

Maybe either a disgruntled editor at one of those stations or someone who's just really good at video editing and has a lot of time on their hands. And a reason to move really fast. 
$C: Honestly this video should be nominated for some award. 
$C: a true patriot
$C: This is definitely done through the use of some sort of speech analytics tool. Very impressive.
$C: I felt like I was watching CrowbCat
$C: Last Week Tonight dedicated part of yesterday's episode to this too. 
$C: Just like how Reddit edited it so it doesn't show up in the all time top posts when it should be #2. 
$C: Fantastic choice of clips
$C: Whoever edited this did a great job. 
$C: Probably better than the actual editing of the news stations. 
$C: Was going to say. What an excellent video.

Too bad for it to pick up any traction it would need to go through the exact channels it's exposing :/. 
$C: The end repetition brought the end of "[Know your Enemy](https://youtu.be/zSHtniUl8V4?t=4m42s)" to mind.
$C: Yeah, this person had to sit through these news sites.
$C: This is brilliant 
$C: Probably a Sinclair employee 
$C: Whoever edited this did a Great Job.
$C: Jesus this was well done and horrifying.
$C: Seriously tho, my head would explode trying to put this all together 
$C: Whoever edited this did a great job.
$C: Some matrix level stuff when all those tv screens came on one at a time there
$C: As leaning to the right, I say the same thing. With 90 karma how easy it is to be flipped. :)
$C: Yes.  Great editing. And this is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Thank you for posting this. 
$C: Holy shit!!!
$C: I never login... And I logged in because this is fucked.  Fuck you Fox News!
$C: He is extremely helpful to our democracy.
$C: Is the source actually known? This is an excellent vid but rarely is there not an agenda and I'd be curious who created this

Edit : remove a _there_; here a there, there a there, everywhere a there
$C: Indeed. Gold tier.
$C: Who did put that together, though? Was it a news show, like PBS News, or something like that?
$C: He's now a target.
$C: It was folks at Last Week Tonight with John Oliver :)
$C: *really
$C: We the people, are in their debt.
$C: Deadspin. It was deadspin. And they’ve been posting it EVERYWHERE. 

It was pulled a few times but now it’s being run around as anti trump so it’s going strong. Have fun!

 https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/03/this-amazing-video-shows-how-local-tv-stations-across-america-are-parroting-pro-trump-propaganda/

So. Much. Salt. 

It is a creepy video though. It got me too until I saw the originals and the context. Though, I’ve never been a fan of MSM so fuck em all. 
$C: It's a group of people working on all those videos, no way 1 person is watching all those shit channels waiting for the exact speech, both sides have 100s of people who specialize in media warfare and i'm talking about pros, not some kid in his parents garage!

$C: There is software everyone uses for this 
$C: One would say, they did a golden job 
$C: GRU got talant
$C: *was paid.
$C: Twenty thousand up votes within an hour, it could be on track. Nobody better use a damn blue shell.
$C: My guess is the mods will pull the video for being political and no one will care.
$C: Mission accomplished - it's now the top scoring /r/videos post [of all time](https://imgur.com/MtaqyeA). The /r/all main view hasn't updated to reflect it yet but [by score](https://imgur.com/tJil5Ls) it's now the #3 reddit post of all time after just twelve hours.
$C: 100k upvotes and 16 gold laters...
$C: Wait till some conservative mod comes around, this this shit’s going to get scrubbed.
$C: Guess [what](https://imgur.com/a/emRQw)?
$C: Yeah! So people can yell for a while and then forget it in 3 days and go back to funny kitty videos
$C: I did my part as a citizen.
$C: Ive never seen so much Reddit gold. 
$C: 181k upvotes and ~~almost~~ 50x gilded... I've never seen a post like this... 
$C: I'm doing my part, it's a good message presented well.
$C: It doesn't accomplish anything. This isn't the first time this type of video was posted before, and the others have hit the front page (unless of course Reddit amnesia is real and no one actually recalls anything posted more than 7 days ago).

We'll forget about this in a few days as usual, and I'll likely repost this next month. 

It's an endless cycle, and I dare anyone to try and break it.
$C: Top of the front page for me so we're doing well
$C: It’s already the most upvotes post on /r/television.
$C: 232k Upvotes; When top of all time for /r/all gets updated, it'll be #2.
$C: 233k and going pogchamp
$C: It’s number one of all time now, that was quick 
$C: Is /r/prequelmemes leaking?
$C: It made it! #1!
$C: Fuck ton of gold rn 
$C: I’ve never seen a post gilded 23 times (as of right now that’s what it is, it will probably go higher)
$C: One of the most heavily brigaded certainly.
$C: I’ve seen this on Facebook about a year or so ago...fucking creepy as fuck, because it was all ABC, CBS, FOX , NBC all giving the same speech..now if it was just the Right Wing FOX stations repeating this all across America , its biased... but to see both Liberal and Right Wing news centers spewing is insane ..We really are treated as cattle..sheep .. whatever you want to call it .
$C: It’s one of those videos that Redditors will make big. 
$C: Why?
$C: As long as it doesn't usurp emperor palpatine I'm fine with that
$C: 43 Reddit golds and counting in only 8 hours.  Gotta be a new record 
$C: Even if it goes viral, do you think any of the stations will report on it even for a fluff piece?
$C: It now is, however you don't see it anywhere on /r/all when sorting by top.
$C: Should have been [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIevazPIPzU) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAkxR9T01pw) years ago.
$C: Currently number 25 on www.reddit.com/top
$C: Dreams come true 
$C: It already is.
$C: What's the record?
$C: >193,966 points (93% upvoted)

notbad.jpg
$C: It’s currently on the 15th place of the most upvoted posts after 12 hours with 200k upvotes.
$C: 200000 upvotes and counting, 50 golds, i think this has hit a nerve. The question is, what to do about it?
$C: Two hundread thousand upvotes with a million more on the way!
$C: 13 hours later and were at 211k
$C: I almost forgot to upvote I was eager to read them there comments, thnx
$C: It is the most upvoted video on the sub currently 
$C: It’s not appearing on the top all time posts 🤔
$C: 219k and counting...
$C: Currently rank 143, and climbing!
$C: At the rate of upvotes, it could be the most upvoted to date! 
$C: But this video will cause people to lose trust in mainstream media and that is extremely dangerous to our Democracy.
$C: 97.6 thousand now
$C: [deleted]
$C: wont make the slightest difference 
$C: "Just change it up a bit so it doesn't look obvious you copied"
$C: Well, this video exists now and they can't really undo that.  And its really impressive how OP edited it all together like that without one ounce of editorializing. 

Honestly this is one of the most persuasive things I've ever seen. OP didn't even think it would be seen this much and he went to sleep[.](https://imgur.com/cXA7XxW)
$C: >collude

Collide? It’s not collusion, these are top down orders from the ownership.


$C: This isn't so much colluding as being forced to do it.
$C: Honestly probably isn't worth the effort for them. Nobody is going to do anything, and most people who watch these channels don't really care. 
$C: For clarity, these local news anchors don’t have a choice when Sinclair Media says to speak - they can lose their jobs.  So they aren’t going to go off script.  

It’s truly sad.  
$C: [removed]
$C: It's  it colluding, one media organization (who I believe has a conservative slant) requires that it's local news channels include certain things.
$C: Great, it'll sound like some lazy high school student's attempt at hiding plagiarism.

"OK I need a synonym for 'dangerous'....hazardous! Good. Ok... now I need another word for 'fear'... 'trepidation'? Eh, I guess...." 

They're doing to our media what was done to our public transportation system. If something is a threat to you, and people really like it, you just buy it up, run it into the ground, and people will abandon it freely. Then you can replace it with what you wanted them to use in the first place and they'll thank you for the change. 
$C: It's actually happened multiple times and they don't.
$C: Sinclair has "must-runs". 

It's intentional that all of these are similar. Sinclair makes their stations run these scripts. No other outlet/network in local news does this.
$C: "Extremely dangerous to our democracy this is."
$C: Change up? OK.
This Democracy is extremely dangerous to us
Done.
$C: Scary. This is exactly what will happen. 
$C: Are we the real April fools?
$C: Doubt it. 

They have treated the American audience with contempt. 
$C: *this* is #EXTREMELY *~~dangerou~~* not safe to our democracy
$C: They wont bother and thats the point. Monopolies are bad, kids. 
$C: They are extremely dumb to change it, so i am skeptical 
$C: NO COLLUSION
$C: [Collude](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/collude).

So nobody forgets what the word *actually* means. it's been thrown around too much recently, and its meaning is becoming obscured by misguided usage. 
$C: It's actually strange that they hadn't already done this. I suppose the big boys already are. Think about it.
$C: But, isn't that dangerous for our democracy?
$C: Ever played the whisper game? Yeah. That'll probably happen
$C: If they belong to a single entity and has the same message, then, What's the problem? I think it's better to have a single, consistent and coherent Moto than having different, which means they have a single, unified vision which was quite unbiased, atleast, if you trust what they are saying. With that said, the real problem is can we allow a single entity to control so many mediums of news? Absolutely No!
$C: I really hope we get free beer and pizza to help is forget about it 
$C: That’s extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: My station I believe is done running it now. It was a limited running. I think we had to run it once per show for about 2-3 weeks? But we should be done now. So the wording won’t change, they should just all disappear. 
$C: Is it "collusion" when the parent company tells the stations what to say? I seriously don't understand what is so crazy about this. 

Should they have had this segment recorded by some celebrities and then aired on all their stations? Would that be better?

People act like the news anchors give two shits about their local area anyway 
$C: This was pointed out several times in the past couple of years. Yet everyone keeps forgetting about it.
$C: They can't change it up, they're crazy occultists who believe the phrases themselves have power and need to be "charged" by having people think about them.  Watch Eyes Wide Shut for more information.
$C: Actually, that’s maybe more true than you know. Normally, when the local stations’ producers get scripts they have full permission to edit so it’s more relatable in their markets. Then, the anchors get another editing opportunity as the last-pass “I’m reading it, so I’ll say it how I want.” 

So, the fact that all the reads are word-for-word would allude to the fact that corporate maybe demanded a word for word read.

If that’s the case, that’s why I wanna vomit. And, it’s especially awful... considering most of those anchors are under contracts and have no option. If they don’t read it, they’re in breach of contract and could get fired or sued...
$C: Didn't John Oliver already show this happening though?
$C: I wish I could see each anchor's face when they eventually see this video. Would be interesting to hear their thoughts on this stuff
$C: This has been happening for years. Welcome to the sheeple state. 
$C: Shhh... don’t use the C word. They hate that. 
$C: You're acting like they give a shit
$C: THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO OUR REPUBLIC

Here's another one, nothing's original.
$C: The boomers are the people watching these stations and so long as it gives them confirmation of their convictions and the local weather, older people don't care. Hopefully younger generations will continue to be more aware of manipulation of the masses than our fathers.
$C: There was no collusion
$C: Someone doesn't learned how to properly *copy* his friend's essay for homework in highschool 




$C: God, even Biff was smart enough to have George change up his homework. 
$C: You'd think that by them having so many "competent reporters" they'd mix up the wording or something... 
$C: It’ll be the journalistic equivalent to “borrowing” your friends essay. 
$C: Don't worry guys, once they see this they will make sure to change up the wording a little when they collude so this doesn't happen again.
$C: It’s a corporate pr message, why are people thinking they shouldn’t be saying the same thing?
$C: Per your information.

$C: Funny how hearing the same thing over and over and over really removes all meaning from the words. 
$C: The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
$C: Yet we believe everything they say 
$C: It's funny how the message they're sending is actually right. They're just trying to get you to believe that it's the *other* guys
$C: Too bad we are not a democracy. 
$C: "Fake news it not real!"

From working for a news agency, never believe what you see on the news
$C: How can these people call themselves journalists? It's a fucking disgrace to the profession.
$C: Now think about it real hard. The same people pushing this narrative of only them being right are the same people that are demonzing Trump, pushing gun control, and reporting very specific information on foreign events. 

Think about that. And think about it really, really hard. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Until you realize they didn't mean actual fake news like your racist uncle sharing Brietbart articles they meant "fake news" like the New York Times.
$C: all of it's correct:

> the sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media. more alarming, some media outlets publish these same fake stories without checking facts first. unfortunately, some [???] push their own personal bias and agenda to control exactly what people think. this is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 

classic right-wing projection, accuse the opposition of what you yourself are guilty of. the most troubling part isn't so much the script or what it says, but the fact that they rely on people's trust of local news, and declare their "fair and balanced journalism," before doing exactly what they're criticizing.
$C: The best kjind of propaganda is correct.

This is Sinclarian neo nazis propaganda.

The whole point of 'fake news' is to cultivate strong emotions and dismissiveness with anything that doesn't feed the neo nazis fragile white view point
$C: Except we are a Republic. 
$C: Conservatism is very dangerous to our democracy. It's not democrats doing this, it's the republicans.
$C: Why is a same script a bad thing? Fake and incorrect news is bad for democracy.
$C: Neo Nazi propaganda
$C: [deleted]
$C: They’re also in the process of buying out Tribune’s stations which would give them a whole lot more.

Edit: spelling
$C: and last year the FCC gave big corps like Sinclair the right to shut down news departments in smaller markets. So those smaller markets will just get their news from nearby larger towns which makes it easier for them to do whats going on in this video. 
$C: Glad my city wasn't on that list.

$C: Who do we have to thank for this?

Fuck Ajit Pai.

Allowing them to expand from 38% audience reach to 72% through a UHF loophole.

And Congress allowed it to happen.
$C: Thats why I really appreciate PBS and NPR radio. 
$C: > The stations are affiliates of various television networks, including ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox

Holy shit, I didn't realise how much of a monopoly they had..
$C: I'd say that is extremely dangerous to our democracy...
$C: Had to go down 5 top posts to find you, next dozen under you don't mention Sinclair at all - they're doing a good job of burying any mention of Sinclair.

I'm just going to mention Sinclair a few more times to help with google page weight - Sinclair is as far-reaching and evil as Fox News now, in my eyes.  Honestly, as far as chess pieces being moved into place goes, can't you just picture the day when Sinclair calls an election for a Republican early, or runs with an Election eve  "accidental" misleading piece on a Democrat?  Between Sinclair and Fox, old folks don't stand a chance.
$C: I work in news production, our two stations used to be owned by Sinclair before I worked there. We’re still owned by a major company based out of NJ (were in CA), but it doesn’t seem to be as soulless. 
$C: Holy shit. From [this wiki page on the Executive Chairman and son of the original founder:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_D._Smith)

* In a speech to business executives in New York (on December 16, 2016), Jared Kushner said that Donald Trump’s campaign had struck a deal with Sinclair to provide extra access and coverage.

* Sinclair Broadcasting has hired Boris Ephsteyn as their chief political analyst. Mr. Ephsteyn was previously a spokesperson for Donald Trump's campaign. All Sinclair stations are required to air Mr. Ephsteyn's commentary nine times per week. He was born in Moscow, Soviet Union and emigrated to the United States as a child.

It's Russia all the way down. This country is fucked.
$C: I wonder why they have very little ownership in the biggest big cities? Twin Cities, STL were the biggest I saw but no Houston, NY, LA, San Fran, Miami, Chicago, DFW.
$C: Perhaps we need to start contacting advertisers!!! ;)
$C: Proud to see no AZ channels on that list!
$C: [deleted]
$C: They also own Circa, an online “news” app targeted at millennials.
$C: We should be tweeting this video at every station on that list
$C: They are also likely to snatch up the iHeartRadio stations when they go bankrupt.
$C: From the current CEO/Owners wiki page:

"The Sinclair Broadcast Group has been controversial due to Smith's broadcasting decisions. Smith airs what many believe to be only right-wing viewpoints and has cancelled news reports that do not lend themselves to support of the President George W. Bush White House, as with the Ted Koppel Nightline broadcast in 2004 on soldiers killed in Iraq.

Further controversy has been provided by the commentaries of the network's Mark Hyman, which aired on the local news shows of Sinclair Broadcast Group affiliates across the nation until Hyman ended his daily commentaries on November 2006.

It has been reported that every news station under Sinclair’s umbrella is required to syndicate commentary that comports with its owners’ ideological views. [6]

In a speech to business executives in New York (on December 16, 2016), Jared Kushner said that Donald Trump’s campaign had struck a deal with Sinclair to provide extra access and coverage. Kushner said the agreement gave Sinclair Broadcasting stations special access to Trump during the campaign and in exchange, Sinclair would broadcast their Trump interviews across the country without commentary.[7]

Sinclair Broadcasting has hired Boris Ephsteyn as their chief political analyst. Mr. Ephsteyn was previously a spokesperson for Donald Trump's campaign. All Sinclair stations are required to air Mr. Ephsteyn's commentary nine times per week. [8] He was born in Moscow, Soviet Union and emigrated to the United States as a child.[9]"

$C: Funny how long it took someone to name that neo Nazis propagandist
$C: More telling, I think, is [this list of their political donations](http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000029062&cycle=2016). They donate to both sides of the aisle, but give about twice as much to republicans.  I feel like it’s not at all ethical for a “news agency” to fund political campaigns or causes. 
$C: 173
$C: Crap. I guess I'm switching news stations.
$C: Can someone savvy can overlay all those cities with the current electoral color map?
$C: And they currently own a wrestling company. [Ring of Honor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Honor) (before they were independent)

along other subsidiaries:

* Tennis Channel
* a bunch of equity holdings such as broadcasting equipment, equity and financing firms. 
$C: I've worked at 3 of them too. 
$C: Any idea what percentage this is of local news stations?
$C: They own 4 out of the about 5 local stations in my area and I've seen a couple of these on the news at night. its crazy to know i can turn one station on and flip to the other three and basically hear the same thing. 
$C: All the more reason not to watch WPGH. Thanks for the list. 
$C: CW is on there, damn.

I watch a lot of their shows.
$C: The NBC, CBS, and ABC affiliates with the best reception are all Sinclair-owned in my part of western Oregon. (KATU, KMTR, KVAL) Just checked after noticing one in the video. Ouch
$C: Time to start boycotting some local TV stations.
$C: Glad Hawaii isn't on the list.  We have our own local echo chamber problems to deal with.
$C: I knew one of those clips had my local news anchors in it.
$C: Cool. My favorite news station isn't on there.
$C: I don't think 30yo watch these stations for news anymore. In 10 to 20, people not watching these stations will be the najority of voters.

We'll still have the issues with facebook or whatever comes next but at least people will then be exposed to the idea that they can be manipulated.
$C: So nearly entire state of Ohio. Nice.
$C: r/bestof
$C: [deleted]
$C: People in those markets, please do something about this and boycott! The only way we'll get anything done, is if we speak with our wallets. 
$C: u/the-camster , is this correct? 
$C: This is what is extremely dangerous to our democracy! 
$C: I agree with them one thing. This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Their mission is to push the right wing agenda.
$C: Why are so many required? Seems redundant unless there’s significant really local news daily? 
$C: Look Louisiana, we did it! No Sinclair! 
$C: Do you think this is extremely dangerous to our democracy?
$C: Why are all of the evil corporations based in America? 
$C: Channel 12 in Cincy went to complete shit a few years ago and now I know why.
$C: On the one hand, this is pretty scary. On the other hand, no one watches local TV except old people and they'll all be dead soon(ish). This isn't as huge of a concern as say, Facebook & CA. 
$C: And we can thank Ajit Pai for letting them own even more.
$C: So which way does Sinclair lean?  Conservative or liberal?
$C: They also own Ring of Honor \m/
$C: This *is* extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: They should not exist 
$C: Sinclair gives me the willies. Talk about a mega-conglomerate news company for the right that Fox News didn't think they could reach.
$C: Aw shit, they own two of my cities four news stations. Well guess, what. Fuck you Fox 2 and ABC 4.
$C: this is not an isolated thing. In radio and Telvision maybe  10% at most of stations are independently owned and that's generous. The majority are owned by some sort of extremely large corporation that owns stations across the country.
$C: Thank God they don't own a station in KCMO. I do feel sorry for Columbia and Jeff City though. 
$C: Why am I not surprised that they own all the news stations in my home town :/
$C: I am curious to know what Americans will do about it. Probably nothing again. The country in a deeply corrupted state. Media and politics are openly compromised. If there is ever a moment to fight for truth and fairness, it is now.
$C: For-profit news is inherently not journalism. It’s an agenda. I can’t believe we’ve let it come to this.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: Good lord! They own Telemundo as well??? My life is a lie 
$C: Balls
$C: With the average american’s critical thinking skills in mind, the top folks at Sinclair basically dictate reality for millions of americans
$C: And it’s legal thanks to bill Clinton in 1996.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Thank you. 
$C: Basically neo nazi propagandists at this point.
$C: Good thing we are a republic 
$C: The Revolution will not be televised. 
$C: It's a total fascist organization, it also makes our shitbag retard president an hilarious moron for whining about Washington Post being somehow a lobbyist organization. God I hope Trump kills himself. 
$C: This is extremely dangerous...to our

$C: You've always been with us. We just never let you see it until the time was right
$C: Yes, but on the bright side, you get to fuck all of our daughters. 
$C: Yes, a neo nazi cult that wants to normalize the idea that anyone who doesn't parrot your white superiority confliction is dangerous to your democracy
$C: A cult called conservatism. 
$C: Kind of Orwellian
$C: 2nd'd. I didn't think so many local news sources would be well, like this...

It reminds me of how luxotica owns a ton of sunglass brands, but then remains hidden in the background while they rip people off with a monopoly
$C: I really wasn't sure how to comment on my thoughts about this but you worded it perfectly.
$C: TV news needs to die... quickly.
$C: "Any dictator would admire the uniformity and obedience of the U.S. media". 

--Noam Chomsky

Noam has been somewhat prophetic on this topic. The book MANUFACTURING CONSENT did a number on me.
$C: Same. I am thoroughly shook  
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: [John Oliver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvtNyOzGogc) did an interesting segment on this.
$C: its genuinely creepy and orwellian. the fact that the subject matter is about manipulation of information just adds an extra layer of hopelessness. 


$C: 1984
$C: If you liked that, you'll love [Spin](https://youtu.be/PlJkgQZb0VU). 

Back when the tech was new, TV stations used to broadcast their unedited feeds for anyone to pickup via satellite. This guy spent some time just manually going through them looking for politicians being naughty. 

It also has a similar segment where Barbra Bush and Bill Clinton do the news thing like you see here.

*Edit* Forgot to add that this was back in the early 90's. I can't imagine what new tactics they've developed since then.
$C: I really didn't think this comment would be as disturbing
$C: Read Manufacturing Consent by Noam Chomsky and you'll get even more disturbed
$C: Really hit home when I saw on of my local newscasters. Wasn't so humorous after that. She's the one near the end during the "democracy" speech that looks like Shreks wife.
$C: Look at the replies your comment got... 1.  Kind of Orwellian 2.  

I find your comment to be extremely dangerous to our democracy 3.  

Now this is extremely dangerous to our democracy 4.  

This is extremely dange...

Nope. I’m not going to say it. I quit. See... Instead of bringing on a serious conversation, the trolls come out and steer the conversation into something 'funny' or irrelevant. That's the new world for ya baby! 
$C: Well edited, especially with the choice of the order of the end sequence. Really builds the tension and overbearing threat.
$C: It starts off funny but by the end you’re uncomfortable 
$C: https://youtu.be/RE-uhXKO-nk
$C: The VERY FIRST station featured in this video is my old station (job). I worked in the industry for 10 years and walked away after working here. People ask me why I'd choose being a bartender over having this job. I feel like this video sums up my answer perfectly.
$C: What do we do about it?
$C: When you can't trust even your local reporting, you know you're thoroughly and completely fucked.
$C: Yep, worse than I had imagined from just reading about it.
$C: Fox News: come for the media bias, stay for the owellian re-education process
$C: It needs to be said in the open, this is conservatives. This isn't a both sides issue. This isn't democrats and republicans both. It's conservatives. They're the ones creating their echo chambers and creating propaganda. 

E: Well that's the most blatant brigade I've seen. 10 comments all in the same 2 minute period.
$C: I really didn’t think this video was going to be as disturbing as it is
$C: [deleted]
$C: Can’t agree more 
$C: What the hell, how deep does this go?
$C: It is genuinely creepy, they all look like programmed clones. 

Which I mean, after seeing this, I guess they are?
$C: I kept waiting for the video to be slowed way down to morph the voices into warped and deep sounding evil...this is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: I really didn't think USA was a democracy.
$C: Seems a lot like Reddit.
$C: Horrifying.
$C: Hail Hydra
$C: This is extremely dangerous for our democracy. 
$C: Show me an politician both honest and competent and we will be looking at someone who was raising alarms bells about media consolidation long before the events of 2016.  National leadership did very little to resist this disastrous trend since it started in the 1980s.
$C: Yeah! AllI can say is: "THIS IS EXTREMELY BAD!" Not the editing but the fact!

It's...an eye opener!
$C: "This is extremely dangerous to our democracy"


"WE ARE BORG" 
$C: I never realized just how much the news was controlling the way we think. I mean, just when we think we have a free society where we can think and act and be whatever we want to be, we somehow end up back in nineteen eighty eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcers table 
$C: This is extremely ~~beneficial~~ dangerous to our ~~plutocracy~~ democracy.
$C: I love (and am creeped out) by how it ended.  All these goddamned zombies saying it's *dangerous for our democracy*.   Couple that with the disingenuous expressions of some of these anchors and it's shudder inducing.
$C:  disturbing and contradictory.  If only there was a way to show the masses this hypochrisy. 
$C: “The battle for the mind in North America will be fought in the video arena...” 

- Videodrome (1983)
$C: Same here
$C: Oh wow
$C: For those wondering it's stations owned by Sinclair.  You the same one that just bought a ton of market... 
$C: >I really didn’t think this video was going to be as disturbing as it is

Kind of like the Tide ads
$C: “This is extremely dangerous to *are* democracy”
$C: That's because it's dangerous to our democracy.
$C: It seams that this is extremely dangerous to our democracy...
$C: It is ok though; we are living in the safest times we have ever been in, more upward social mobility than ever seen

Sure some people are corrupt and greedy, but just keep shining a positive light on the world and we can overcome anything
$C: That was so funny. Only because America is disgusting
$C: It's so fucked up
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy 
$C: Same. I figured they would say the same message but different wording flavored to the local population. But to hear the same phrase word for word is just wrong.

These "reporters" are more like wind-up dolls owned by one hidden mega-corp.

I wonder if they didn't think this would get out? We don't live closed off from other people anymore.
$C: All just a bunch of Russian puppets anyways
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: That's called good editing.
$C: *this is extremely dangerous to our democracy*
$C: It's like they're basically robots just repeating out the same line over and over again.
$C: We all did
$C: Holy shit no joke
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: This was depressing. 
$C: Oh it’s extremely disturbing on all sides. 
$C: That shit is scary
$C: I love how it ends with "this is extremely dangerous to our democracy" repeated 
$C: Welcome to Hellworld.
$C: Sinclair broadcasting and fox news are 100% anti-American , anti-science , anti-middle and working class republican propaganda.

There is nothing left-wing that even comes close to matching this bullshit.
$C: It's fucking scary. Just outright frightening.
$C: Genuinely frightening to my very core.
$C: I really didn’t think this video was going to be as disturbing as it is


$C: It makes me sick
$C: Umm, yeah. This has been going for years. Rush plays these composites all the time. 
$C: The more they said democracy, the weirder it sounded
$C: It’s disturbing, but absolutely beautiful.

All it takes is mass distribution and social networking for this to unveil itself. 

They did this to themselves.

Good looks and fake personas can’t save your ass now. 

$C: The way it focused on the individual delivery as well- the passionate scare mongering tone that is meant to make you feel like the journalist is on your side and determined to defeat propaganda.

I’m sure they will get smarter about their scripts but I suspect there will be some anchors who use this video to push back.
$C: What? The land of the free? Whoever told you that is your enemy! 
$C: We need 90's RATM back.  Now more than ever.
$C: FUCK YOU I WONT DO WHAT YOU TELL ME

$C: Obligatory, “This needs to be higher up!” Because it actually does.
$C: It's also being left off trending on YouTube when it definitely has the traffic to be there 
$C: I see it. Hey /u/spez what’s up?
$C: Because it is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: its at 248,000 upvotes and still not on r/all top of all time.
$C: Back on /r/videos, but still censored from /r/all.
$C: Just to say, it is a possibility that you have the setting that hides posts that you've upvoted.
$C: Just chiming in that I browse Reddit every day and somehow completely missed this. I just found it by sorting by "top from this week" randomly and it was at the top, but I should have seen it at some point when it was originally posted. 
$C: It was removed by a mod and then restored. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/88n470/this_is_what_happens_when_one_company_owns_dozens/dwltjvg/
$C: It's back.
$C: I had to leave come back and scroll back down to your comment. I know that I’m super late to the party, but I don’t understand how this is not top of r/all. Please help.
$C: Maybe Sinclair owns a stake in Reddit, too.
$C: Shit is going down, that's what's happening.
$C: It was never removed...you must have the setting turned on that hides things you've already voted on.

How many people on this site are these tin foil hat folks that think "IM BEING CENSORED WTF"
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our Democracy.
$C: But I have brought Peace, Freedom and Security to my new Empire.
$C: And everyone's reaction is to make a joke out of it.

That's the scary part.

$C: This video has received a collective of nearly 150k upvotes on Reddit in the last 6 hours, and at least 400,000 views on Youtube in 6 hours. It is NOT on Youtube trending. You know what is? The no.3 trending video on Youtube right now received 170k views in 14 hours, "FASHION PHOTO RUVIEW: Very Best Drag Looks with Raven and Raja"

I'll give you one guess why this video isn't on trending.

$C: I suggest investigating Operation Mockingbird. This type of propaganda has been going on long before A Shit Pie ever landed on the scene and still continues today with amazing precision.

$C: > Something about it being dangerous to something. 

You seriously couldn't figure it out?
$C: I think a big giveaway the first time I saw this segment was that I could tell the local newscasters were NOT into it. They were smiling and doing their thing, but... it was like listening to someone talk when there's a gun pointed at them off-screen. Not that dramatic, but I'm guessing their jobs were on the line, if nothing else. Before this, they had to air those stupid mandatory segments, but now they have to actually read these and put their own names behind the sentiment. I feel bad for them.
$C: Collect emails. Unionize surreptitiously. Demand an end to these forced opinion pieces.
$C: Pretty sure there’s an AMA Request out there calling your name right now

I believe this is where your country takes a turn from plain old capitalism to straight up fascism 
$C: > We all hate this too. 

not enough for most of them to do anything about it. 

$C: why be held accountable when you can hide behind [MOD] status

Reddit allows unaccountable power, and it needs to change that shit like a soiled diaper
$C: don't worry i sent a message too, glad others spoke up and spammed the modmail. looks like it worked because its back, 


i agree, whoever did it in the first place needs to be removed from being a mod
$C: What the actual fuck is happening?
$C: What the fuck? This got deleted? 🤔🤔
$C: Yes, that's how propaganda works.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our irony meters.
$C: Ironic isn’t it? They could save others from dangers to our democracy but not themselves 
$C: You have used the word *irony* correctly. I will cherish this moment. 
$C: Not directly, they are describing multiple viewpoints, many of which are lying to push their own agenda as a threat to our democracy.

One viewpoint, which sometimes lies to push it's own agenda, spoken through multiple voices, is our democracy as intended.
$C: Yeah, I work for a Sinclair station and hate this shit. 

All the feedback we’ve gotten has been negative thankfully. 
$C: It's the top play in the right wing playbook: accuse the other side of the underhanded shit that you're doing.

Edit:  Looks like I hit a nerve.  Try to be cool to each other, my bomb throwing notwithstanding
$C: The local Sinclair station in my area ran a different add asking for viewers to contact them on FB if they felt the station was being biased in their reporting. 
$C: i wonder how many of those presenters are aware of what they are doing and how many just see it as a step on their career ladder
$C: Work for a Sinclair station. All the feedback that I’ve seen (and I’m in a managerial role) has been negative towards this. Ask and you shall receive. I love it every time I pass it on to our news director. 
$C: No, they're talking about fake news whereas the video we watched shows how all media are controlled by a small group of people
$C: #*G*aslight 

#*O*bstruct

#*Project* <- you are here

That's the GOP.


$C: I am by no means saying cable news is better but FFS so much of local news filler time is 'Now to Carrie who tweeted us this' or 'To Paul with this review posted on facebook'.

Heck even in some of their faces it looks like they know it is full of shit.
$C: double-think
$C: I think the worst part is that the message is accurate and correct
$C: Agreed.

As a behaviourist...

*I enjoyed seeing the subtle (micro expressions) to outright obvious head shakes of the newscasters when they are stating:*

**“...this is extremely dangerous <head shake> to our democracy...”**

(Head shake, no I disagree or I know I’m lying.) 

• They know it’s propaganda, and they do NOT agree. Fun to watch. 
$C: That's also how they build trust. By saying "oh yes, we are very aware of the issue that 'others' are doing. You can trust us though because we're aware it's an issue." Then proceed to take that trust and manipulate how it fits their agenda.
$C: It was written by a Russian propaganda producer who worked for RT
$C: While I agree this is scary they do have a point that a shitload of fake news flows through social media constantly.
$C: It's projection. This is what Trump and the Russians have been doing all along. Accuse your enemies of doing what you're doing to muddy the waters.
$C: >directly contradicts 

I disagree. 

Yes thwm all havIng a same message is bad but these are local stations reporting local news.

Sure it comes from one source on many channels but they are talking about checking facts and good reporting, reporting stories that haven’t been properly vetted. 

It’s a commercial promoting diligence and fact checking. While creepy when played exactly the same way on multiple channels it’s message is still a good one. 
$C: How so?
$C: They could save others from fake news, but not themselves. 
$C: [removed]
$C: The message is that big tech companies which advocate for (and benefit from) liberal policies should be punished for allowing individuals to tell lies. Did you know that people are allowed to *lie* on the internet? What are people expected to do, just question every piece of information they're presented with?
$C: Its that Doublespeak. 
$C: > The power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them… To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just as long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies—all this is indispensably necessary. Even in using the word doublethink it is necessary to exercise doublethink. For by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality; by a fresh act of doublethink one erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth.
$C: How?

The investigation features several innocent people who were put away with nothing more than a cop's inkling. Blood tests eventually came back negative, but it took months to process the results.

$C: Someone hold me
$C: Like, this is actually terrifying. This is some dystopian shit. I don’t want to live in a world with dystopian shit.
$C: I said this in another comment, but we put entirely too much trust in news anchors. These people (mostly) aren't journalists. They're not experts on anything. They're actors reading off of a teleprompter in a heavily inflected cadence designed to sound confident and trustworthy. They're people who would have gotten into TV and movies if they were more talented and/or better looking. 
$C: Why do you "hate to say it"?
$C: Fuck Ajit Pai.

Also... I'm Ron Burgandy?
$C: >  These people will literally read whatever is on the teleprompter, and it's the same script.

No, it's more a matter of Sinclair media telling all its anchors "Read this or you're fired" because that's literally what happened. 
$C: >These people will literally read whatever is on the teleprompter, and it's the same script.

As someone currently going to school for television broadcasting, yeah that's basically all it is.  These people are just being fed a story.  Depending on the network the anchor may have covered the story themselves, but with larger ones a lot of the times the people behind the desk are literally just talking heads, and these networks have access to the same resources for stories, so it's not very surprising that they'd all use the exact same script as it's a big story right now.

*But* that doesn't make it any less creepy or any less problematic that 100 different news networks can be feeding you the same agenda *in the process* of reporting on a story that is *about* bias media. 
$C: I wonder if this is a problem that will solve itself? I don't have the numbers, but I have to believe that anyone under 30 or so is watching WAY less broadcast TV than used to be the case. I mean, I don't know anybody that watches it except when there's like a local natural disaster or something.
$C: For-profit news is inherently not news. It’s propaganda.
$C: We need to adopt the media ownership laws of Norway, where one owner is not allowed to own more than 40% of shares of any outlet.  They are 1st in Press Freedom.  We are 41st.  And we are rapidly plummeting down the rankings.  
$C: In regards to that top part, not that I agree with this *at all,* but local broadcast news is an extremely competitive market. I don’t work at a Sinclair station and don’t know anyone who does but I can at least understand if someone doesn’t want to risk their employment. 
$C: It is sad the news anchors (are they even journalists?) have such low standards in many cases. 
$C: Stay classy, planet Earth!
$C: If you think that's bad, ISPs are even more consolidated and they do have the power to curate content.
$C: This is the truth. We must bust up the media conglomerates. 
$C: Even *competing* national news channels will use identical phrases when reporting stories.  They just take what the AP puts out, add an intro and end, and maybe pad it to fill another minute of time.
$C: > These people will literally read whatever is on the teleprompter, and it's the same script.

This is not what is happening. Sinclair has a "MUST RUN" agenda regarding specific coverage and content. No station group prior to this event has had any such uniformed approach to intentionally, publicly stated coverage of news. 

The reason that this is uniform is because it was designed to be and mandated that way by Sinclair HQ. 

The recent rollback of the ownership rules basically allows Sinclair to do to local broadcast markets what Clear Channel/iHeartMedia did to radio. 

How'd that work out?
$C: Just remember Ajit Pai was nominated to the FCC by Obama. 
$C: [It's been this bad for years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAkxR9T01pw), not just because of Pai.
$C: Can't believe the people are still so good as to honor Ajit Paj's right to free speech while he is destroying theirs.
$C: "These people will literally read whatever is on the teleprompter"

Uhhh, that's what they are paid to do. 


$C: Democracy always has and always will be a scam, dude. 

They knew it all the way back in ancient Greece. Sophists will feed you bullshit, gain power over you, then exploit you any way they can.

Nothing has changed since then. You have a choice of which of the pretend to be different parties pretends to want to do what you want them to. They do just enough to placate whoever is angriest and carry on looting everything they can.

Watch the Mechanism on Netflix. Republican or Democrat or any party doesn't matter, all the parties in Brazil are corrupted and it is the same in every democracy, the ones in Brazil just got caught and couldn't get away with gaslighting the public and dismissing it as a crazy conspiracy theory anymore.

Whoever you vote for will always say "Oh gee I really want to keep this promise I made to voters, but this other party man they are OBSTRUCTING me! I can't do anything but continue to make rich people richer! Oh gee for some reason we can always agree on that somehow."

They literally won't do anything real to serve your interests unless you fucking riot. It is the same with every power relation. The microcosm is on reddit, mods and game companies and shit won't meet poster's requests to make this or that change that costs them money unless they make a mass riot everyone typing in all caps and making threats to take the money away.

Mao was absolutely correct that "All political power comes from the barrel of the gun", and these people literally want to disarm you, figuratively silence you from making any disruptive speech, and when it comes down to it won't make any real change unless and until you get over the juvenile bullshit that "violence is never the answer" and actually threaten real mass violence.

America has blown about $10 trillion dollars in stupid wars trying to spread "our democracy" in the middle east now with nothing to show for it except for a bunch of dead and wounded bodies. They've sucked a year out of every worker's life. The money to blow up all that shit and try and fail to rebuild all that shit ended up in some very corrupt people's pockets and now every worker owes them a year of their life to  get that money back. AND THAT IS JUST WAR FUNDING.
$C: [Fuck Ajit Pai](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7jxtrv/friday_fun_offtopic_megathread/drab96b/) 

$C: Voters would have a much clearer view of their choices if everytime someone said 'Ajit Pai' they said 'the Republican Party' instead. He's a GOP henchman and nothing more. He does what they - and by extension, their wealthy donors the Mercers and Koch brothers - want to be done. Pai is not the root cause here.
$C: Old and inaccurate (GE owned NBC Universal and sold it to Comcast, GE never owned Comcast).
$C: Bit outdated now, but the point still stands 
$C: And it will be forgotten the moment you wake up the next day. 
$C: All aboard!
$C: The internet is a double-edged sword. One one hand, because we have (for now) access to any websites and information we want and the ability to host any information we want, these kinds of propaganda machines can be combated. At the same time, the internet can be used as a tool to proliferate that content.

$C: YES, too many people think that speaking out against hateful rhetoric is propaganda because “political correctness suppresses my free speech” when the core of it is literally not being an asshole to people. But really it’s the people with the money and power that do it in a much more subtle way with the core being motivation for more money and power.

$C: i for one love that this is finally coming out in the open. trump is literally such a bad president that he's causing the propaganda of the monopolies to collapse in on themselves with how much they're tripping over their own ravenous hatred for him.

like don't get me wrong: he's a mong. but the fact that it's all everyone's ever been talking about for a year makes me think there's this big shill happening. and i was right. see, what they're doing is they're putting trump in the same basket as anything to criticize the media. so if you say "hey wait a minute, isnt this media doing some sneaky bullshit?" people automatically are instructed to assume "oh, and what? are you some kinda trump supporter or something?"

and they tried too hard and now its plain as day what they're doing. i've been saying this for close to two years now and i'm pretty sure even my own mother thinks i'm a trump supporter because i don't consider CNN reading out tweets and playing grammar police on live television to be quality news. i'm just very happy that i'm not crazy but also very angry that i'm NOT crazy and we've actually slipped this far down the slope and things have gotten this bad.

$C: Post doesn't show up on my front page even if I go down 30 pages but plenty of other posts from over 20 hours ago that I've already seen show up. It's not appearing on the top of /r/all either, despite being the second most upvoted post of all time. Is this for real?
$C: That's not what that ranking is talking about at all. Their main issues seem to be with Trump's rhetoric against the MSM and Obama's prosecution of whistleblowers. From their website:

>US press freedom, enshrined in the First Amendment to the 1787 constitution, has encountered several major obstacles over the past few years, most recently with the election of President Donald Trump. He has declared the press an “enemy of the American people” in a series of verbal attacks toward journalists, while attempting to block White House access to multiple media outlets in retaliation for critical reporting. Despite the bleak outlook under Trump, it bears repeating that his predecessor left behind a flimsy legacy for press freedom and access to information. Journalists continue to be arrested for covering various protests around the country, with several currently facing criminal charges. The Obama administration waged a war on whistleblowers who leaked information about its activities, leading to the prosecution of more leakers than any previous administration combined. To this day, American journalists are still not protected by a federal “shield law” guaranteeing their right to protect their sources and other confidential work-related information. And over the past few years, there has been an increase in prolonged searches of journalists and their devices at the US border, with some foreign journalists being prevented from any travel to the US after they covered sensitive topics such as Colombia's FARC or Kurdistan.
$C: I can't believe Japan is way down at 72!
$C: But the media has shifted. A huge portion of the younger generation don’t even watch the news. They use online sources. Thats way more egalitarian and open than news was 50 years ago. 
$C: In before /r/videos mods lock this thread.
$C: Doesn’t help that the only people with ambitions to become small news networks are those finding tiny, crazy niches like InfoWars (literally calling mass shooting survivors and their family “crisis actors”).
$C: Ok. So. What can we do about it aside from just not watching any news whatsoever? And where do we get our news? And don't say Reddit. Reddit is just as bad. I want a non biased way of getting news, and I don't think that's possible.
$C: I don't understand how American news got to the point of being so sensationalised and so obviously politically leaning in both directions. What's wrong with just reporting what happens, as it happens?
$C: but muh furst ammendmunt
$C: Glad I live in the UK where this isn't allowed to happen.
$C: Support your local NPR station!!!!!!
$C: There is a great book, The Media Monopoly.   I did a report on the book for a media class in college around 1992... It is scarier today than it was then.
$C: I have a friend that works during the overlays for local news. He just happened to reply to an ad in the paper for a job. He had no desire to work in the news. After being there for about 2 weeks he told me. "You have no idea how much news doesn't get reported." 
$C: Oh thank god Canada isn't too bad 
$C: I’m starting to think this is really dangerous to our democracy!
$C: Well, this is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: To be fair, freedom of the press only keeps the government from limiting the press. Corporations are as free to publish what they want as individuals are.
$C: The most powerful country on the planet is living an Orwell nightmare

This won't have a happy ending, I bet
$C: Freedom of press isn't limited to the television, which shows why their creepy delivered message is very true.  Corporations are able to censored and manipulate social media like Reddit.  Legislation preventing the expression of free speech on public platforms needs to be implemented or there will be more division, more hive mind mob mentalities, more "brainwashing".  People are forgotten how to make logical non-group arguements.  

Great example is when Reddit delays the beck out of your post because you haven't got enough positive karma, don't agree you can't speak today.  
$C: This website was a great read, it is mind blowing how close China is to North-Korea when talking about freedom of press !

I read about my country, Canada, and was actually ashamed of my country for its actions against certain journalists. 

Thank you for sharing !
$C: More importantly,  media is classified as entertainment in order to avoid libel laws.   No accountability means no trust. 
$C: Honest question - do you think Reddit helps us gain more freedom? I.e. how much of an improvement is it?
$C: It may not be desirable, but that is free press.  They are free to do this kind of thing. 
$C: Apparently the 1% really wants me to know about pussy hats and that Trump might have learned to say “nyet”. 
$C: That's not what freedom of the press is. Freedom of the press is the freedom to create an organization to say what you want to. We have that. Press freedom /= press diversity. 
$C: > You are fed what the 1% wants you to know



Which is the narrative coming from Hollywood and cable news..... 🤔
$C: Ah yes. Because the 1% all have one homogenous opinion about everything.
$C: And that seems to be TRUMP IS HITLER 
$C: Is it because Sinclair is a white wing organization, or even a neo nazi propagandist?
$C: I love it when i see posts that link to fox news with zero upvotes or being downvoted to hell, same with many of the other very far right wingnut news sites, nicely the likes of msnbc and other left wing news sources really  are not as bad or blatent with there partisanship.
And the only argument they have with cnn is that they make everything breaking news which is rather funny now that trump and muller and the republicnan party as a whole gives us real breaking news almost every single day.

$C: [removed]
$C: The thread was taken down and locked for "being a stolen video". Seems one of the mods restored it shortly after.
$C: I see it as up and number one on /r/all at the moment, I think it was momentarily removed and restored (my guess). 

I mean, sorry, "this is extremely dangerous to our democracy."

edit: now it's gone, apparently went against the no politics rule. 
$C: Yes 
$C: Wait, it's still on /r/videos but it's gone from the front page... Why?
$C: time to find those IPs and username...
$C: No. I just found it on front page
$C: Yes, apparently they removed it because it's political which is total nonsense. 

The mods here are terrible. A few days ago, someone posted this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk99NofbLVQ), which investigates how cops are able to put drivers away in jail just on the suspicion that they may be high on weed. 

The investigation features several innocent people who were put away with nothing more than a cop's inkling. Blood tests eventually came back negative, but it took months to process the results. 

It's extremely thought provoking, but the mods removed it because of Rule 7 - No public freakout. Except if you watch the video, there's literally no public freakout or violence **at all**. 

Power tripping bullshit all around.   
$C: Probably a pro-trump moderator who needed this to go away.
$C: I just saw it on my front page less than 5 mins ago. Don't think so. 
$C: [Here's a full clip of the full script.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBlZCeRMRyY) 
$C: These people legitimately look like brainless robots.
$C: "Someone please buy our station from these crackpots"
$C: nah probably a mod and an employee of a multinational corporation who works for reddit as well
$C: [deleted]
$C: And that's with the mods doing everything in their power to keep it from getting votes. Even now that public outcry has forced them to unremove it, they've still tagged it as "disturbing" to try to slow it down. Absolutely laughable.


$C: [removed]
$C: Compiling all screenshots and info I can get. I have the video downloaded as well. Any thing else you see or find would be greatly appreciated. A sincere thank you for keeping tabs on this
Edit: typo
$C: Mods put a stolen video tag on it and removed the thread, but it seemed like it was restored. 
$C: I noticed this as well...went to my history to find it again.
$C: I’m here from r/all
$C: It was taken down but now its back.
$C: [removed]
$C: They wanted to bury this shit so bad, but too many people have seen it to get away with it. Whoever wanted it removed PRs team decided it would hurt them more than keeping it up.

$C: On the bright side, we have just witnessed the birth of a beautiful new meme
$C: It always has been, and it always will be here to stay until we actually fight against this.

Remember [the outrage when Tom Wheeler](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-media-rules/fcc-chair-proposes-retaining-most-u-s-media-ownership-rules-idUSKCN0ZD2QC) tried this crap? We had SOPA-style regulations to fight at the same time that was plastered on Reddit in 2011, and Wheeler tried this again in 2014.

Since he left, I've seen people actually want a Democrat running the FCC, which is the most outrageous thing I've read these last few weeks. Sure, [Ajit Pai wants to deregulate as well](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/technology/fcc-media-ownership-rules.html), but Wheeler made it clear that it is the entire FCC. Not only are they all corrupt, but the circlejerk against Ajit Pai has turned it into a bipartisan issue and assume Republicans are the mastermind behind all this. No one on Reddit appears to remember what happened in 2011, 2014 or 2016. I remember we all had posts about this, but [Obama made it very clear where the government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countering_Foreign_Propaganda_and_Disinformation_Act), both Democrats and Republicans, stand on this issue.

It doesn't matter if it's the Republicans or the Democrats. This type of Orwellian action has to go and those who support this, no matter who they are, **HAVE** to be held accountable and explain their reason for this.

It's never about democracy, it's always about control. 
$C: I was already on it and refreshed to see it got removed
$C: nope
$C: I like “This is extremely dangerous to our monopoly.” 
$C: [removed]
$C: I've counted 2 removals so far. I can only imagine the mod drama going on at the top of /r/videos right now
$C: just Correcting the Record....
$C: Same here. Still shows in r/all but the "disturbing content" tag seems to be preventing it from appearing on my frontpage even though I'm subscribed to r/videos. I wasn't aware tags could have that effect.
$C: I think this is a really interesting point. In theory, this monolithic message throws out the "bad" with the "good". (That is, from the frame of reference of them trying to suppress liberal news, they would ostensibly want to target liberal sources, not all sources.) However, by targeting media as even being capable of delivering "objective truth", it fosters a culture where people reinforce their own opinions within their own filter bubble, and they cannot be moved by the "correct" version of the story because its "correctness" can be ignored. 

Now, philosophically, I don't believe in objective claims to truth, so this moment in American democracy is very confusing for me. It makes me want to insist on objective truth just to displace the nonsense. I guess I'm encouraged by the fact that these people I'm imagining are not likely to change their minds anyway. But I'm starting to worry that elections can be tilted by the right kind of gentle nudge at the right moment. Media control got a lot smarter in the Big Data age. 



$C: > Putin has used it in Russia to destroy any expectation of objective truth and the US right has seeded it for years domestically through their constant proclamations of media bias and ever increasing anti-factual leanings. 

On a side note, Sinclair media recently hired Kristine Frazao, a former employee and anchor on Putin's state-owned propaganda network Russia Today to produce political commentary that their local affiliates are forced to run. It's not just the same strategy, **it's the same people**.
$C: So how do we stop it?
$C: You seem pretty agenda-driven...
$C: Will you admit that buzzfeed, salon and mother jones are all liberal propaganda?
$C: Anti Russia news is propaganda too. 
$C: >This isn’t just massively ironic, reflexive projection. This is an identified authoritarian propaganda strategy to paint all sources as agenda-driven and biased. Putin has used it in Russia to destroy any expectation of objective truth and the US right has seeded it for years domestically through their constant proclamations of media bias and ever increasing anti-factual leanings.

$C: I have to agree. The only solution I can see is a worker's revolution.
$C: You’re so dumb.
$C: This should really be higher up in the comments. I feel like a lot of people are missing the point
$C: Right? Fox News is agenda-driven and biased. Why isn't the government shutting down their fascist and authoritarian speech? CNN, Salon, The Young Turks, MSNBC are objective.
$C: Or if you remove your tinfoil hat and do a little research, you’ll learn local affiliate stations make a fraction of what they used to make due to the internet making local news practically irrelevant.

To stay financially competitive each station has been cutting costs by eliminating personnel and resorting to reading from the same network scripts.

$C: What's really scary is how news works. 

There is a lot of 'trading up the chain' where stories are picked up by small time blogs (blog in this context is any sort of information source online, twitter blogs websites etc), who are then read by larger bloggers, and on it goes up the chain till you have a major news outlet reporting about it. It's how a few mean tweets on twitter about [x] get turned into a news story.

You have a similar thing with wikipedia, do you check the sources or do you rely on the fact that was already done for you. There have been times where you click the source link only to be sent back to 1999 and a page that fell strait off of geocities, you would not trust that page as an authoritative source if you went strait to it, but the exact same text copied into a wiki article, well... 


$C: Same.  
I'm always, "good morning to you, too."

$C: Lol, expecting mods to justify their behavior? Good luck with that...
$C: It's all Sinclair-owned stations.  They're not picky about network affiliation.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_of_Russia

> In 2016 Russia was ranked 148th out of 179 countries, six places below the previous year, mainly due to the return of Vladimir Putin.[4] Freedom House compiles a similar ranking and placed Russia at number 176 out of 197 countries for press freedom for 2013, putting it level with Sudan and Ethiopia.[5] The Committee to Protect Journalists states that Russia was the country with the 10th largest number of journalists killed since 1992, 26 of them since the beginning of 2000, including four from Novaya Gazeta.[6] It also placed Russia at number 9 in the world for numbers of journalists killed with complete impunity.

$C: It's because top posts fall from the top over time. It was at the top... At 12 AM EST last night. I agree, it's really bad. Also read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/7j5w9f/_/)
$C: Because of this stupid shit here: [click](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/7j5w9f/_/)

And because top posts will fall down the front page over time. Not sure how long. It's dumb though, that's for sure.
$C: YOU really have to be a partner to get trending, or something innocent like a grandma dancing... random channels dont get trending 
$C: Watch the Project Veritas report on Youtube. The Trending™ page has nothing to do with what is actually popular. The Trending™ page is all corporate shill videos from CNN, NBC, FOX, movie trailers, pop music videos (VEVO), and a few hand picked LGBTQIAATP++ activist videos.
$C: This is funny but a little different than what's happening in OP's video.  Every station subscribes to one or more newsgathering services that provide video and scripts that they can plug into their newscasts.  The Conan bit is just them being lazy and not rewriting any of the leads/intros they were provided.

OP's video is a "must-run" segment from Sinclair.  Stations are forced to run this; they don't have a choice.

$C: I was scrolling down the thread for this **exactly**. Thank you. 

Yeah I don't know why the fuck this is on the frontpage. Jfc I'm not even that old but I guess Reddit is even fucking younger than I thought it was.

Along with this I recall like 1 or 2 other vids that had this *exact* premise, and that was when I was still a fucking freshman in college. Yet Apparently now Reddit thinks they've cracked some secret code and deciphered some illuminati conspiracy.

BITCH we had vids like this for goddamn years. Yet no one gave a shit until now apparently. Exactly the same thing when we made fun of Celebs talking about borders and shit and then building literal walls around their properties or whatever. Apparently Reddit only cared about it since last week because Fuckerberg suddenly became a bit too no-no or whatever.
$C: Saved it before it went down the first time. Doesn't help much unless we can find a way to make the file spread though. Reddit is compromised. Let's see if Google holds, or bends the knee to sinclair
$C: Some of the moderators are trying to censor this.
$C: You aren't wrong. It's gone.

$C: Instill fear and the dumbasses will fall for it every time.

It’s how the GOP deep state works. 
$C: Meaning????
$C: That's a very good question...
$C: Www.Theknifemedia.com
$C: It's still flagged as "stolen" but if it's stolen why don't they sticky the original in the comments? Otherwise that sticky is useless.
$C: What are you quoting?
$C: No, you're not understanding what's going on. If it was just Russia by itself doing election tampering, it would not be a big deal.

As the CIA and other intelligence agencies have pointed out, the problem is that Trump and various media outlets have *embraced the Russian propaganda and made it their own.*

On top  of that, the Russian propaganda has been specially targeted to increase radical and extremist viewpoints on both sides of the political spectrum. 

The billions of dollars spent by super pacs, the media bias, that has been going on forever. But this new stuff we are dealing with, like Russian propaganda, has made our democracy more divided than it has been in about 100 years. 
$C: Yeah every time someone is up in arms about "meddling", I want to remind them that foreign lobbyists exists. 

$C: The "obvious media bias" in this case is from an extremely right-wing company, but thanks for the soapboxing.
$C: To be fair, the Russian thing was a whole lot bigger, and involved a lot more countries than just the US. It was a whole thing here in Europe as well, where news in general aren't considered quite as toxic as in the US.
$C: #This

This is why reddit (and America) is going to shit. Some old fucker tweets and people hyperventilating and shit. I mean, it's fucking Twitter.

I don't care if he's the president. I dont Care if he said he is gonna Gas the country. It's fucking Twitter. It's a non story right up there with Kardashians. Trump says shit cause he knows the media is gonna focus on it like it matters. At this point I'm pretty sure they are all in it together. It's easy money and all they have to do is report publicly accessible garbage.

Real shit is going down and we are all focused on Twitter and some porn star who fucked a rich old guy ten years ago. 

And people call this news? Get the fuck outta here. 

*I'm glad Trump won. He's a poor leader, but he will be gone soon and the world will go on. Meanwhile I learned a valuable lesson about the media and how Americans ate lead by the nose like sheep.*
$C: It sounds almost like you are trying to excuse and downplay this, surely I misunderstand? 
$C: Why should one threat to the government discount another? It's one thing for Americans to try to influence America; that's sort of the whole point, although you're right that we should be trying to make sure it's done properly. It's another thing entirely for foreign, historically hostile nations to do so, and yet *another* for those currently in power to be totally complicit in, if not actively supportive of, said foreign activities.
$C: No, the best part is Sinclair broadcasting having money to spread neo nazi propaganda.
$C: The message out of context is not wrong because the message also applies to them, but within the context it was originally intended for, to act as a way to legitimize their news station and discredit all others, is of course malicious and wrong. 
$C: If you really think your information sources are immune, then the propaganda has already been at least partially successful. 

Every snake oil salesmen convinces the mark that *they're* really smart and it's *everyone else* who's too dumb to know what's good for em. 
$C: Yep. I sent this video to both of my parents. They still watch and mostly trust the nightly news. I NEVER liked the news. Even as a kid. The news anchors always seemed so disingenuous. Because they are. 
$C: many of our elders also have a lot more experience in the world of working. Don't go ignoring them completely.
$C: That was the point of locking and removing it twice
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: It questions the system. It’s a bold one. 
$C: I think so, probably a soft verison of hiding the post...in other words, cenorship. 
$C: yeah i noticed that, got really confused for a while as I thought it got removed
$C: Agreed can't do anything too stop them, that train came and is way gone. They got there merger.
$C: It is tagged as disturbing so doesn’t show up to users. 

If you don’t sign in and go to the front page you should see it.
$C: good test
$C: it's on my front page top for this week and month. Then it disseapers from year and all time. 
$C: Same, but this will affect a whole lot of Americans who haven't.
$C: Resistance is futile. You WILL be assimilated. 
$C: You are certainly free from influence now! 
$C: How are news casters the problem? Everything they say is scripted, written by someone else who is trying to push an agenda. 

Also, spamming exclamation marks and question marks come off as rather unintelligent!!!!!!!
$C: I have upvoted almost every comment and the post..... take it to the top.
$C: [deleted]
$C: why?
$C: Sinclair group is a uniquely large and far reaching company. This isn't a both sides type of deal. Nobody else owns as many local outlets as Sinclair, and nobody except Sinclair forces the local outlet to run their biased scripts in this manner as presented in OP's video.

This is a conservative company playing extremely dirty and propagandizing the news. 

Biased news is somewhat common. Straight up fake news, like Sinclair, is not.
$C: That's simply not true. Biased news is virtually everywhere. Fake news are stories that are completely false and made up. ABC, Fox, CNN, MSNBC, NYT, WaPo...all of the big boys are NOT reporting fake news. The news will be real, but the spin will be different depending on where you're getting it from.
$C: wrong. Real media doesn't write a fucking script and make hundreds of stations repeat it. 
$C: You offered no reason or evidence for your strange and contradictory claims. 
$C: Sinclair broadcasting is a neo Nazis sympathizer, right up there with it news in russia
$C: Yea, damn that neo nazi Sinclair buying reddit bots to up vote racist content
$C: Bullshit, CNN and MSNBC and FOX are all free thinkers. No spin, fair and balanced, trusted names, this is who we are.

Edit: are the downvotes for my sarcasm being undetectable or because you guys think any of those are actually good sources of information?
$C: [deleted]
$C: If you think Reddit is being run by Trump supporters you've lost your damn mind.
$C: The difference is, T_D claims this is evidence of ALL media being corrupt. The actual sentiment here as far as I can tell is that Sinclair-owned media is corrupt, not all.
$C: T_D hates nearly all media. The vast majority do not even like FOX, save one or two personalities.
$C: I fear that you’re underestimating reddit. Most of the comments I’ve seen have been bashing the media as a whole. 
$C: Not me. I want the press to be as free from manipulation as possible. A daunting task. And related, I hate drug advertising. As a pharmacist the degree of manipulation is sickening. 
$C: I like how everyone is coming together on this issue and now I’m seeing nothing but right wingers talking shit about liberals. If you want change to happen you should be talking shit about the media doing this, not how the left *might* react. 
$C: yes
$C: But people love to be told what to think and they love to have an enemy to hate
$C: You completely missed the point. Local news stations all around the country are being forced to regurgitate propaganda by a media conglomerate, which is unprecedented. A bunch of separate entities having the same biased opinion is a very different thing. 

>sinclair channels read a common script warning against unbalanced journalism and fake news, telling people to check their facts and to not believe everything they hear

This video is just one example. Sinclair loves forcing it's agenda. 

>reddit : OMG THIS IS DYSTOPIAN 1984 THEY ALL SAY THE SAME RIGHT WING PROPAGANDA !!!

Even /r/The_Donald sees how dangerous this is, so why can't you?

https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/88n923/this_video_was_deleted_twice_from_the_top_of/
$C: The fact that you really seem to think only one agenda uses media manipulation is proof just how effective your own tribe's brainwashing has been. 
$C: Surely you do know most mainstream media is anti Trump and anti conservative right? 

Or are you a parody account? 
$C: Conservative bias? You’re joking, right? Mainstream media is almost entirely left leaning in the USA. 
$C: So like, did you just describe liberals?


1.  ABC, NBC, CNN - They own most of the media

2.  They report with a liberal bias.

3.  They said this literally about Fox and anything conservative, huge hypocrisy on this one, thank you for describing yourself.

4.  --

5.  What the left does but aimed at the right.

6.  Left wants to abolish ICE and break down the constitution and the rule of law so they can be hip and socially accepted on the latest fake-sympathy trend for attention and moral high status.

7.  The left's job.

$C: Heh, never knew that had a name.  Yeah, that's been my suspicion for the past few years of having my eyes actually opened - branded fronts for some kind of operation, all with the same general but unique and subtle delivery.
$C: Capitalism is why America is corrupt, what we are seeing is the expected consolidation of business that always exists in capitalism.
$C: The real horror is your post. First that you are actually shocked by this and second that you are shocked that its specifically happening in the US.. Americans and their weird delusion of their country of the free. 
$C: This isn't cable. These are local over the air news stations.
$C: Why is everyone equating this video with conservatism? The news is almost entirely liberal!
$C: Larry King also works for RT
 
is he a Russian puppet also?
$C: Still caused it to be dropped off of front page of reddit
$C: Extremely 
$C: That's because it is. 
$C: Probably not. Paycheck 
$C: [deleted]
$C: This is what happens when dozens of your dick are owned by one company

$C: It's censorship and you should be afraid because of the the status that Reddit has.
$C: This is coming our way. 
$C: You're the target. I'm very sorry.
$C: no, reading IS their jobs
$C: https://imgur.com/a/tVMKV
$C: haha yes
$C: You should leave it. 
$C: This man speaks the truth
$C: Organize
$C: Stand by for r/dankmemes and r/memes.
$C: Also managed to catch this in time 
Historic Reddit screencap 4/1/18 https://imgur.com/gallery/QQ9me

$C: Same rather read on reddit about the news if it's important..
$C: i saw. its cool tho
$C: Do your parents know?
$C: those numbers dont lie....sadly
$C: I’ve gotten down voted asking why these threads are so huge. I’ve know the media is shit and can’t be trusted so I thought there was some underlying message 
$C: me too, but its just so wordy. if only they could find a way to coordinate and send a unified message?
$C: Top comment form the thread 
>I subscribe to the uncensorednews sub. Believe me, a ton of upvoted content over there was outright bullshit. Fake news is real. People make money from clicks.  
Now, the media will surely smear that "Fake News" label on anyone they don't like, but what can you do? It's like the "Alt Right" story. Such a thing exists, but that doesn't mean we're part of it.  
 
You know the right labeled the entire industry to fake news and liberal leaning later on. Using false information is not an alternative viewpoint.
$C: You (we) have to stop with the adversarial red vs blue, train of thought. That’s why we’re in the mess we are in today. Too much ginger pointing. NBC reporters were there as well. The point is the media has a LOT of power in our perception and culture. We as a society have to recognize ALL news has an agenda and to not take everything they say at face value. 
$C: It was there for a while, then the thread got locked and later deleted for politics. Then it got restored but somehow it doesn't show on the front page anymore. Still, looks like it's gonna be the top post of all time in /r/all (possibly in less than 24 hrs, if this keeps up.)
$C: Mostly because we are a Republic and NOT a democracy.
$C: But this one is not nearly as hard to pull off because the parent company controls what the news stations say so you can just send the script no problem.
$C: Tell me who to trust then. Honestly that's the scary part - you don't know who you can trust.
$C: Again.
$C: Surprised I had to scroll down this far to find this video. John Oliver really nails what Sinclair is doing with news stations.
$C: Pot kettle black
$C: Google isn't a news organization, it's an aggregator.

And seeing how it keeps pushing tabloid UFO articles at me for no reason, I wouldn't exactly call it trustworthy...
$C: The_Donald has been saying pretty much this about the media the entire time. Except that they are reading a anti Trump script. And this is at the top of TD. So quit bullshitting

Here is [one example](
https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nHwA1weL3_w/V5NSUTCL3qI/AAAAAAAAJtE/_bnGcNiKpU4zoWbZNu8aAKQL_bXDXAlqACLcB/s1600/darktrump.png)

Here is [another](https://hoboken411.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/trump-chaos-media-headlines-body.jpg)
$C: Cool it with the antisemitism pal 
$C: I can get behind this. Can we please start a Disney boycott? 
$C: Holy shit i wish i could give you gold for that spot on dad joke
$C: Lol. 
$C: Someone in the original thread posted a good idea. Boycott ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox unless the remove thier affiliation status with these local stations
$C: Congratulations, you just figured out the motive. 
$C: Carve out the happiness you can find or make for yourself, and make your voice heard through local elections and local government involvement via things like city council meetings, etc. Your voice matters in local politics like no other, and trying to steer the influence of the handful of people who truly wield it has to be a bottom-up affair. They do what they do because they can, and they can because most people let them. Turn your despair into fuel, because you're right to feel like this is a shitshow but you have the power to be incremental change. Butterfly wings. Get people flapping. Help the people you believe in. 
$C: Cause reddit is no different. People here are controlled and if you ever visit smaller niche subs you see the real users of reddit are not so hardcore leftist and Trump crazed.


Someone made a video of an experiment on getting up votes and Co trolling top submissions. They proved that it's really easy to control the front page with a little money and time. 

That's why you saw r/politics go from anti Hillary and pro Bernie to doing a full 180. And also why it's bleeding into other major subs. 


If you want a "real" reddit experience you gotta stay in the lesser known spaces. There you'll see many people are rather normal.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Test
$C: FOX is owned by Sinclair.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Go straight to the source?

If you see or hear something in the news, go educate yourself on the exact thing they are talking about.
Read bills and policy, watch police footage, read historical documents, etc etc etc.

Don't take their word for it.  But use it as a jumping off point to view the very thing they are telling you about.


$C: >  But how would we ever turn this around?

Boycott your local stations that are owned by Sinclair.

Boycott business that run ad campaigns on Sinclair stations. Make those businesses aware that you're doing so (respectfully.) Local stations live and die by local ad dollars. If they can't get any, they get sold. 

Local stations are reliable and unbiased traditionally, regardless of Network affiliation. It's groups like Sinclair that are the danger. And no other group is as biased and unethical as Sinclair. 
$C: large scale violent revolution and tons and tons of murder. Changing the world isn't going to be pretty. 
$C: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_satiation
$C: lol yesssss. this video is an excellent exercise in that. 
$C: Specially bbc. At least they have some distance 
$C: It would have more if they hadn't hidden it from the top filter...
$C: Perhaps worded a bit morbidly, but very true. Broadcast journalism is nowhere near as important or relevant as it once was.
$C: Because they are easily controlled by fear in an ever changing world. 
$C: Exactly how I feel. Idk how this blew up. Just don't be dumb and get news from semi reliable sources and from their formulate your own opinions 
$C: It's already there.. they seem a bit conflicted over it. 

On the one hand, they're right about the news being awful.. on the other hand, they are acknowledging Sinclair is a right-wing org with ties to POTUS.
$C: Lol the FBI is actual going after the fucks that these news sources support. 

All of these affiliates are owned by the same right winged media company. 
$C: What do you mean, such a person never existed, and in fact such a video never existed, perhaps you'd like to come in for some counseling citizen, yes?
$C: Somehow I don't think the FBI and Sinclair are affiliates.
$C: Sinclair be creating alt accounts to downvote all the top comments lmao
$C: What's even weirder is that some comments are being downvoted.
So they're being pushed to controversial. As to an hour ago when barely any of those comments appeared on controversial.
$C: Either editing or it’s just that classic news caster voice that they all use 
$C: The video shows apparently boilerplate commentary across _several_ stations owned by the [Sinclair Broadcast Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_Broadcast_Group).


$C: That's the secret Cap, there is no real news.
$C: >  Frank Coletta what have you done.

It may be contract-based. If Sinclair remains the owner, see if he's still there in 2-4 years. If he stays, it means he chose the contract paycheck over his ethics. 
$C: Fear is freedom!  Subjugation is liberation!  Contradiction is truth!  Those are the facts of this world, and you will all surrender to them!  You pigs in human clothing!!!!
$C: This is the first thing I thought of.  For those out of the know, it reminds me and OP of an "Electric Dreams" episode called *Kill all Others* based on short stories by Phillip K. Dick.
$C: And the gullible majority spooning that stinking filth into their eager mouths.... Thrilled to be slating the dragon, fighting for good. While they handle the devil control of the majority on a silver platter through unconstitutional legislation intended to benefit lobbyists and assure power stays in the right hands.
$C: Could be malicious compliance 
$C: Boris Epshteyn for sure.

But let's not forget who enabled this: the FCC's very own Fuck Ajit Pai.
$C: Dont fool yourself into thinking this isnt happening in your country where ever that may be.
$C: These aren't cable stations. 
$C: This video alone should be proof enough to everyone across the country that the party is over. Cut the cord and just rely on an over the air antenna and streamed content.

Just consolidate all of these stations under one banner and identifier and stop putting up the false appearance of being unique and local.


$C: If you think this is scary, dont read Atlas Shrugged.
$C: Cord cutters are ending up in places where it’s even more cost effective and technologically possible to define the parameters of their world. Eg by bots, voting systems, cookie tracking, history etc.


$C: I'm interested, what is it?
$C: Yes, yes you are absolutely confused. Because you Reddit.  
$C: If you want journalism read a paper.  The ones doing the stories themselves like reporters on TV and writers at the paper actually put a lot of effort into what they do.  Anchors just tell you what someone else wrote. 

$C: I don’t see any mention or water mark of a parent company. I see each presenting their view as though it’s local to them. You won’t spin this in your lords favour. 
$C: How can you say it’s a statement from the parent company when the people reading it don’t say that? They are obviously trying to make it seem like it’s any other kind of news report instead of an ideology being pushed by Sinclair 
$C: Horrific. 
$C: Extremely common among owners of multiple local tv stations.  Other large groups include Nextar, Scripps, and Gray.
$C: They're all owned by Sinclair.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Multi billion dollar companies owning broadcast stations in several markets. Someone pointed out that these are all Sinclair media group. Rather than pay people at each local station they just have a few people telling them all what to say. Its that way with the radio. 
$C: The result of Democrats and Republicans both bending over for corporate money.
$C: I noticed the exact same thing. It looks like it's quarantined in r/videos.
$C: It's quarantined in r/videos. Doesn't show up on r/all even though it's the second most upvoted thread today.
$C: Can't wait until they can edit in Mueller saying it too!
$C: S X E Phil. He’s not sexy... :p
$C: They became or were always part of the machine 
$C: Maybe, maybe not even a very high price. 
$C: YouTube view counts aren’t always real-time
$C: Yup. Cray cray. 
$C: This is why net neutrality is so important, the more people and opinions you have access to, the better.
$C: You’re not the person they’re trying to manipulate.

Unfortunately, the people they are brainwashing vote in great numbers. They won’t win you over today, but they can steal elections without you...

And they will keep trying. You will wear down. They will wait until you’re old and senile enough, and when you park your old body in a big recliner in front of the TV, they’ll get you too...
$C: And then unlocked. I really want to see what happened behind the scenes at reddit, regarding this video.
$C: probably a flood of messages, i know i spammed 
$C: Looks like it’s back up 
$C: Dude this shit it so bad, I’ve never heard of those companies before or knew they controlled media like this. This world is going to shit. Those people who go shoot up places should go should up the building of the FCC and places like that fuck this shit man makes me so pissed wanting to do something about this. This world is so damn corrupted.  
$C: Cccccombo breaker

$C: pretty sure the post was removed
$C: Hasn't been for a long time.
$C: Reddit is mainstream and highly controlled.

You didn't notice how this was removed by a mod only to be brought back by another (who's probably gonna be fired soon)? 

Wake up dude. 
$C: Jesus, once every hour? what's that little advertising rule about getting someone to see something 7 times? this is disturbing to say the least.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.

$C: Comcast and the other isps are prob plotting too influence there customers soon enough.. don't forget how they used the media, social and politics too make a point on net neutrality..
$C: Hahaha
$C: Pretty much all anyone can do. Sinclair will continue too try too get bigger. We need too vote in order too make sure a FCC chairman is working for the people. Not for some company that gets more rights then Comcast and such.. those same companys can go over seas and buy more stations but they refuse too until America is fully consolidated.
$C: democ-REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-cy
$C: Just now 56 :D   
We're living in reddit history books.
$C: if you mean you arent american so this doesnt affect you i can understand that stance. but yeah, my main issue is the same message on all channels, thats some next level dystopian shit. others hate Sinclair because of their political leanings (historically conservative), and then there are those that have been saying this exact thing has been happening(though not this transparent) for decades, and use that distaste for propaganda as a large reason for being pro-trump, and his campaign promises to "drain the swamp", or fix issues like this. then there are those that dont understand why they're angry, but mainstream media irrationally pisses them off and they'll look for any reason to fight a stranger to feel superior.

mod drama, mistagging, and conspiracy stuff. skim through here for a decent summary of what('s) happened (happening)
$C: 1st part: yup
2nd part: not quite, but moving up there. number 7 overall right now. number 1 on this subreddit though
$C: Vote for people who will change this shit. That's the only thing we can do in our democracy, unfortunately.
$C: Hi! I'm not scared. I know it will, and kudos to the cab driver post, too. I'm sincerely happy for him. Anyway, my post had a good run, and my other post, "Reddit's Immigrants" will also make the top 10 of all time. I will no longer have the number 1 spot, but at least I'll have 2 gifs in the top 10. So I got that going for me, which is nice. Thanks for the comment, buddy. Have a great day! :) 
$C: We used to have limits on how many local broadcasts a media company could control for exactly this reason. 
$C: All of them are reading the exact same script, on over a dozen news stations; the bit of script shown was about how multiple news outlets are publishing the same fake news without first checking the facts. The example line the original poster made the centerpoint of the video was all of them saying “This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.”
$C: I see you sort by top of all time as well.
$C: The news.
$C: He is just as bad. Same formula over and over.  Bring up topic for 10 seconds, make stupid negative quips, listen to laughter. Rinse and repeat. Every single time 
$C: It's fine, they don't have skulls on their hats yet.
$C: Is it ? Lol
$C: that chutzpah of yours!

$C: "I don't understand why a whole bunch of people who grew up under the failures of George Bush, followed by the successes of Barack Obama are largely opposed to the Republican party."

"It must be 1984."
$C: Exactly. I don't see what's so wrong about what they said in the statement. It's all very true and any stable minded person should be able to agree on that.
$C: This isn't Fox News.
$C: Fox News is a cable channel.  Do you say CBS news, NBC news, or ABC news when talking about a local channels?
$C: Cause he’s an idiot whose actions warrant constant criticism. 
$C: ? They are literally giving warning that what Trump claims is “fake news” is a real problem... thing is, they didn’t determine or decide to say that based on any fact, they were paid to, they were paid to state fake news. 
$C: Funny because the Sinclair group actually hired Boris Epshteyn of the Trump administration as Sinclair's chief political analyst. They air him on every one of these stations praising trump. Food for thought. 
$C: That is because everyone wants him impeached

$C: Because he's a lying pice of human shit
$C: > Scripted news on the nightly 5pm.

Well, all of the nightly 5pms are scripted, but they're not biased - unless you're Sinclair. 

The best plan is to change it up between stations - if it's a story that you find important or critical, get the information from a couple of sources instead of just one. See what overlaps and make sure nothing was left out.
$C: When the system has become so corrupt there's no way to tell what is and is not corrupt it's time to change things. Eventually it will become so corrupt it can no longer function.
$C: I'm guessing you haven't researched this very much. Good thing other people have been.

$C: I see the tin foil hat is on tight and snug 
$C: We agree on something!
$C: That's right, tie it back to Trump. Why don't you search YT for "news repeating" and fill your heart up with posts that are more than 2 years old. Then blame those on Trump, or grow a brain cell and THINK for yourself. Why did you think he calls them Fake News, and that they are the enemy of the people. 
$C: Lots of people trying to claim that liberal media groups do this as well while providing absolutely no evidence.
$C: Where are you from
$C: Funny but not the same thing.  Those are prewritten scripts from a newsgathering service that stations use and were just too lazy to rewrite.  

This is a must-run segment that Sinclair stations are forced to run.
$C: It's the downside of the FCC deregulation.
$C: >one of the many downsides of capitalism

Yeah, because under a society where the government owns and runs the media we'd have something totally different.

Don't kid yourself. Capitalism is the reason alternative media outlets even exist to compete with these companies, and the reason they have to put out such a robotic fucking message is because they're terrified of the rest of the free market.

You want to know how these big companies shit all over alternative media outlets? It's by getting regulations and laws passed that affect their competitors more than them. They manipulate the fucking government and the kind of control you would like the government to have is exactly what they want, because more government control means a more powerful puppet for them to slip their shitty grubby dickbeaters into.

And I hate to break it to you but Conan is apart of those people who are shaking in their boots over the success of alternative media.
$C: Yes a downside of capitalism.  A single source of oligarchy controlled news doesn't exist in economically socialist countries.
$C: Capitalism? Wouldn't a non capitalist regime simply use the government to enforce viewpoints instead? 
$C: This is the next level though, this is a right neo Nazis porpagandist actively politicizing
$C: Pretty much.  The media has been doing this to us for decades now.  It's just now that the mainstream sheep are waking up to it because the Sinclair Group is just being *so obvious*, but that doesn't mean it hasn't been happening this entire time.  

WMDs are one example. "Cult" is another.  "Militia" another. The media demonizes things and words and fear mongers by repetition and by broadcasting the most hateful person they can find.

Out of 100,000,000 people, they find the craziest one and put a TV camera on him and make the entire nation think this crazy guy is representative of a large segment.

That's what they're doing in today's political debate -- they find the craziest liberal and the craziest conservative and make them the poster child, then both sides hate the other because they think the other side is like this crazy fuck.
$C: This is a Sinclair-specific MUST-RUN script that is intentionally pro-conservative as stated publicly by their leadership. 

No other media group that owns local news stations interferes with operations and news coverage and tells them what to cover and how. 

Sinclair does. This is an example of the mandate.
$C: So, a couple things here. This is about 1 company owning all of these smaller news stations and having them say the same things in an attempt to influence the general public. If you are trying to say that the parent company used to be democrat, then I would love to see some evidence of that. If, however, you are saying exactly what you wrote which is that the news room staff used to be entirely democrat, then that's irrelevant in this case. Also notice that this is not a statement against Conservatives and that it is merely a comment on the current standing of our news outlets.
$C: 1) Sinclair media basically owns 70% of all local news outlets in the country and definitely lean conservative...comparatively local news stations that lean liberal aren't even close to being to the same scale as Sinclair, hence why they are the topic of discussion. If a left leaning media group obtains a super-majority of local news networks in the country and starts pulling that bullshit, then you will have room to talk.

2) RT is literally state ran media...if you really think that 90% of the reporting of what was happening in Ukraine was true and not heavily slanted I got a bridge to sell ya.
$C: The ThinkProgres video, while made of many of the same snippets, is distinctly different from OP's video.
$C: Why would you not want this information spread as far and wide as possible?

CNN *wants*  different websites to host their videos.

This also allows our society *a range of perspectives.*

That's all a net positive for society.
$C: OP's video was much better. 
$C: Did TP post it here yet?
$C: I think that's called semantic satiation.
$C: I get my facts from a stone tablet! 
$C: Really!?  Maybe I'm just jaded but yeah it's been long known that the only thing local about "local news" is maybe the people presenting the majority of it.  Otherwise it's all just piped in from Corporate.  They're like a fast-food chain.  In fact, a lot like a fast food chain.
$C: Well in America it is legal to have so many news stations. usually, people are not satisfied with only one news outlet( i.e. people always get irate over fox/CNN news) so large media companies often have multiple news outlets just to catch the random tv viewers attention. Also, these are from different parts of the US.

source: mass communications graduate
$C: Wrong
$C: Ha. There's those identity politics and a failure to think deductively on a case by case basis.
$C: A media company can own stations that run different networks.  These are all Sinclair-owned.
$C: now the mods here took it down
$C: Sinclair. [John Oliver did a piece on them.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvtNyOzGogc)
$C: I saw the "removed" message too, but it seems to be gone now.  I guess mods either hit the wrong button, or are disagreeing.
$C: Saw this too.  Maybe someone tried to hush this one up before realizing it was too late.
$C: Unless I have grossly misunderstood how the AP works, yes.
$C: In some ways, no. But AP stories are optional to run.  This story was a mandatory directive from corporate bosses that all their stations had to run.
$C: AP provides facts, this company is pushing opinions.
$C: ...That aren't them.
$C: Mistrust for *other* news sources.
$C: Yeah I stopped watching news as well for pretty much the same reasons but also because in the end there is nothing I can do about the stuff happening all over the world anyways. So why even bother.

$C: Voters.

$C: F
$C: When a station is reporting on a story that came from Reuters or AP, they are required to report it in a manner that gives those sources attribution and make sure to relay it in a 2nd hand manner.  They do not report it as if it were coming straight from them or it would be considered plagiarism.
$C: Since when did Disney-owned CBS and ABC become a pro-Trump media group?  Or are you referring to the local FOX affiliates who have no actual affiliation with the Fox News channel? All of these stations are owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group.  OP was not making a political statement, he was pointing out the fact that one company owns all these TV stations who are telling you not to trust social media (because social media has been eroding broadcast media market share).
$C: I knew the Video, Upvoted because the Content, Have a Nice Day.
$C: Not everyone watches the video 
$C: They deleted the video under the tag stolen video and then reinstated the video. Which brings it back but doesn't put it back on the front page of all. So it's on the front page of videos but I'm sure it was "accidently" scrubbed from all.
$C: I mean this video has been on other subs all day so no need to watch this scary ass shit again 
$C: Scripts do exist. But for the exact same script to be broadcast on every major news station? It's wrong. They tell us all the same stories, reworded and paraphrased to provoke a certain reaction out of the people in the area. 2 stations could broadcast on the same story in different areas, and one will appeal to the people in one, and the other will be just slightly different to appeal to the people in the other area. We're being lied to.
$C: Might find this interesting. https://youtu.be/yy1XIxQa4jc 
$C: Is it?  I did watch that once, it was awful!
$C: Chances are all local stations in your area won’t be much different.  Local affiliates would have went out of business years ago if they hadn’t decided to reduce overhead, and start going off the same script.

The differences between channels are stylistic, not substantive.  You choose your local news because of the like-ability of the on-air personalities.
$C: Not for me
$C: I think it goes to show that we shouldn't allow monopolise to show and hope for private benevolence
$C: Sinclair -- it's in the video title...
$C: Sinclair is a media group that requires its stations to run a specific script daily. They actually have pro-Trump coverage as part of their operations. Like, LITERAL pro_GOP biased and stated out loud.
$C: It was only a matter of time until someone tried to make this political.
$C: My guy, do some research, these outlets are owned by Sinclair and are forces to read pro-Trump propaganda
$C: Maybe you you should think of moving out of Detroit 
$C: You clearly don't interact with anyone over the age of 40.
$C: **Sinclair Broadcast Group**  

>Sinclair has faced scrutiny from media critics, as well as some of its station employees, for the conservative slant of their stations' local news reporting and other programming decisions, and how the company's rapid growth has aided its dissemination of content that appeal to these views.[2][3][4] Sinclair has also faced criticism over business practices that circumvent concentration of media ownership rules, particularly the use of local marketing agreements and similar arrangements to take over stations on behalf of preferred third-parties.

$C: It is. It’s because the emails from the sources are sent to various news stations and they’re rarely changed. I learned about it in class. I’m a journalism major. 
$C: It is what they are saying that's important. To broadcast *that* message on all stations... coming from Sinclair, who just recently bought out all these stations with the intent of delivering pro-Trump news.
$C: Bill Clinton= rapist

Firstly stop watching any station associated with Sinclair 

If a station you know is here demand a explanation for this

Get at Ajait Pai's neck because he has a hand in this

$C: [deleted]
$C: The statement above is one I can get behind!
$C: It's not surprising
$C: We haven't had one in a long time.
$C: I'm sure there's a relevant *Last Week Tonight* segment on YouTube that you could watch.
$C: It means that one group can control what information most Americans see. Hence why this story pushes, "Don't trust the internet, it's fake news. Don't trust other news outlets, they repeat that fake news." It's designed to push people into an information bubble so they only know what the Sinclair Broadcast Group tells them.

What does Sinclair tell people? Some examples:

"In October 2004, just two weeks prior to the 2004 presidential election, it was reported that all 62 of Sinclair's stations would preempt prime time programming to air Stolen Honor: Wounds That Never Heal, a documentary critical of U.S. presidential candidate John Kerry's anti-Vietnam War activism."

"In November 2010, it was reported that five Fox affiliates and one ABC affiliate owned by Sinclair broadcast an infomercial critical of then-President Barack Obama, Breaking Point: 25 Minutes that will Change America, which was sponsored by the National Republican Trust Political Action Group. The infomercial painted Obama as an extremist, and claimed that, during the 2008 presidential campaign, he received some campaign money from the Hamas terrorist group, and that Obama said in a speech, "You want freedom? You’re gonna have to kill some crackers! You gonna have to kill some of those babies."

The Sinclair group requires their channels to run anti-Democrat propaganda, donates large sums of money to the Republican party, and nowadays controls 193 stations. During the 2016 election Sinclair aired a lot of favorable coverage of the Trump campaign, and has been accused of currying favor with Trump in order to get the media more deregulated so as they can buy more stations and control even more of the US news environment.
$C: Happy Cake Day!
$C: Because that's exactly what it is
$C: Jokes on them. Nobody watches TV anymore.
$C: some see it as pro trump
some see it as anti trump
and no matter how hard you try and how much evidence you present both groups KNOW they're right. Gotta love the internet, right?

$C: been checking somewhat regularly the past few hours, and as far as I can tell it never made trending in the first place. Google tends to purge anything from their trending tab that could end up in news headlines. hasnt gone well for them the past couple years
$C: allegedly, yes. officially no. there is a "script" going around right now though, hard to say if it was transcribed from the broadcasts, or distributed, broadcasted, and leaked. some anchors have supposedly come forward anonymously though to admit they knew, and were just afraid to lose their jobs.
$C: not seeing it on mine, but the algorithm curates differently for each user
$C: I'm seeing this at 224k upvotes, but it's nowhere on the front page, nor is it on /r/all if you sort top of all time.
$C: Yeah, we're the fools
$C: They’ll just move the propaganda to the internet. (Which has already begun) 
$C: It's the Sinclair Broadcast Group
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_Broadcast_Group

"Sinclair has faced scrutiny from media critics, as well as some of its station employees, for the conservative slant of their stations' local news reporting and other programming decisions, and how the company's rapid growth has aided its dissemination of content that appeal to these views."
$C: These are local affiliates owned by the same company, which is Sinclair.  They own many different stations with many different parent networks. 
$C: I think they are probably just dumb and their job is to pretend to look concerned about whatever is on the teleprompter, they probably don't even realize that the script is being read by every other station and that they are a propaganda tool.
$C: This is broadcast news. Not cable.  There is a distinction.  
$C: 7th place currently with 230k upvotes?
$C: The USA is a republic. Republic meaning Ruled By Law.  We are ruled and our government is restricted in power by laws.  A democracy is mob rule.  The mob doesn't make laws.  The representatives do.  And our constitution has protections to prevent the mob from over-ruling it.  The word democracy does not appear in the constitution or the constitutions of any of the 50 states.  We are NOT a democracy.  Calling us a democracy is a mind-game to make you related democracy with Democrat.  Guess you can call it the original fake news of the Democrat party...
$C: Or been fired https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Akre

Sorry, what is this in reference to? 
$C: Not sure if you realize this, but this compilation is the result of a pro-Trump organization owning all of these stations.
$C: The thing is Sinclair(the media company who forced the stations they owned to do this) is pro Trump and often agrees with his attacks on the media.

Trump doesn't care about this, in fact he loves it. Just like he loves to watch when Fox news spreads B.S.
$C: I hate it when people's argument boils down to if you don't agree with me you're not an independent thinker.
$C: Lol Trump yelling “fake news!” at every story unfavorable of him is not even close to forming a coherent argument about the faults of media conglomerates.
$C: Trump only attacks the media outlets who criticize him, he loves fake news if it talks about how great he is or how horrible and evil his opposition is.
$C: These are not the media outlet Trump goes after those. This is the only MSM Trump sees a legitmate. Sinclair media is trump news. 
$C: trump doesn't attack the outlets that suck his dick like these. don't be such an idiot.
$C: This is the right wing, this IS Trump.  Trump attacks media that is trustworthy so that it opens up the door for people to swallow this propaganda.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Sinclair broadcasting (the company who did this) is a pro trump media entity. They did this to further the presidents attacks on legitimate news outlets. This is the fake news the president should be talking about but instead this media conglomerate is pushing his narrative to people who only watch local news to trick them into thinking they are legitimate source  and the ones under the presidents attacks aren't. 

They don't care if the internet makes a video like this because most baby boomers who vote R watch local news, they don't surf Reddit. You're just a voter they pick up because you're a trump sycophant and unable or unwilling to accept any sort of information outside your comfort zone. You're literally telling people to do something you don't do. Everyone needs to realize something, what trump does as president is effectively everyone equally unless you're super rich. Their is no my side vs you're side, that is an elaborate trick created by our political system. You're views might be different than mine, but we have more in common than we don't and until we realize that we are being used this cycle of blaming one another while the rich get richer, will continue. 

But back to the point, 

you're telling people to think for themselves, when you're literally not doing that abs you completely missed the point of this and tried to make this positive thing about trump, and an attack on his opponents when it is very clearly made as a rebuttal to presidents trumps claims of fake news and to only follow news outlets praising him. This right here is an amazing example of how pro trump media is organizing to push his message in a cohesive way to people who don't get much news elsewhere. 
$C: The worst part is that Sinclair is a Trump/GOP supporter and is performing exactly what Trump was against. 


$C: your point would be better if trump didn't live-tweet fox news. 
$C: It was Trump's FCC pick and stance on deregulation that allowed this to occur. 
$C: So I should "think for myself" by blindly following Donald Trump?

The man can barely speak English, and it's the only language he knows.  Of all people to follow, it's not him, especially if I intend to be a critical thinker...
$C: For what it's worth the news doesn't tell you what to think, rather what to think about. Just something to consider.
$C: But....but... thats.. trump's media...
$C: > do yourself a favor and think for yourself, as opposed to letting other people tell you what you should be thinking.

Yeah just like these newscasters, right? They are literally being paid to state this message, or worse are being coerced (say this or risk your job / standing in the company). This video is proof of Trump-supporters attempt to control the news, and you somehow spin it into the exact opppsite? 
$C: 6 more years! 
$C: KYS 
$C: No, all of the networks shown here are pro-trump owned Sinclair Broadcast Group and this was a must run. Just a company issuing a statement to it's subsidiaries.
$C: Sinclair media.
$C: Hahaha ya group everything together like the idiot you are, this is right wing line for line utter bullshit.But you! You want to make all news and media the enemy, you fucking fool.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I posted something similar and got downvoted like crazy.not to mention the story they're covering is about the influence of fake news on social media thathelped get Donald Trump elected. That's a legit story and definitely not a right wing narrative. Everyones freaking out because they sound similar but I would imagine for a large non-local story the script probably is distributed from a journalist who covers national news which is fine to me.
$C: > is there a left leaning media conglomerate similar to Sinclair?

No.  As much as I want to believe that the left and right are the same in all their negative qualities, and even though in many other ways they can be, the insanely biased, propaganda-driven, cartoonishly emotional, and often outright false media reporting tends to unfortunately be a right wing thing.
$C: If there was, they wouldn't do this type of thing. This is the definition of right-wing media brainwashing. FOX News created the formula.
$C: It relates to Sinclair Broadcasting, which is a right-wing company that owns all of the stations seen in the video.
$C: This is not a fight between democrats and republicans, it's a fight between the people and the people in office.
$C: Spin?  You fucking kidding me...stupid piece of shit
$C: Youtube is usually or mostly always delayed in updating views, so I thinks it's fine :-) Check again in a few hours or tomorrow
$C: Views don't register immediately
$C: 18,000 views? dude its at 611,000+ views

$C: 20 local stations have 20 different voices, and each have a degree of "hometown authority" for the people watching them. People don't typically expect their small local news to be part of the propaganda machine.
$C: Propaganda works best when you think multiple sources exist.
$C: It's not just the script, it's what they're saying.  I don't think anyone would give a shit if they were all reading from the same script about Arnold being in the hospital for heart surgery.  

The script they're reading from is designed to "flip the script" on false and misleading news, accuse major news media outlets of doing it, and get their viewers to distrust everyone else. 

 It's a propaganda machine.  And I don't mean the new watered-down definition that Reddit likes to use where "everything I disagree with is propaganda", no I mean this is the kind that literally involves nefarious people at the top dictating what everyone has to say in order to influence the opinions and actions of the general public for their own private gain.
$C: If you think the one big news Network is full of shit then you can turn on one of 3 others using a different script
$C: The point is not that nobody is going to watch all 20 stations personally. The point is the hypocrisy of these Sinclair mouthpieces mass manufacturing and robotically delivering "news" in the form of a message that mass manufactured and robotically delivered fake news is a problem. If they admitted that they were the ones doing it it would be different, but in this case they are the ones generating the actual fake news that they want their audiences to believe they are somehow railing *against*...

We can always theorize that the big news corporations are being fed an agenda by their billionaire owners, and we all know it's true... but this video is actual, physical proof that Sinclair is pushing a broad agenda *about pushing broad agendas* to preemptively combat any attack on what they're doing. It's a new level. It's genius and horrifyingly backhanded all at the same time.

We really are living in strange times.
$C: All these stations are owned by the same fucking crooked ass pro republican company. 

It’s all Fox and CBS stations if you didn’t take note. 

It’s full on bullshit scare tactic propaganda.  

Tell your brainless viewership that you are the only news source to be trusted and everyone else is lying. Fascism 101
$C: People trust the locals more than the big stations. Its important how they all lead with how they're all serving their [local community]. Other than their names its the only part of they video you couldn't synchronize.
$C: Its extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: What’s the difference between one celebrity tweeting about a particular issue vs 20 of your close family and friends telling you the same thing?
$C: Literally, yes. Sinclair is the only ownership group that mandates that their stations "must-run" these specific scripts as part of their operation.
$C: Except its the news which should ideally be impartial and unbiased, not some fucking company trying to tell you that their window cleaner is the best in the business
$C: The news should be impartial not some right wing trashy propaganda outlet.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.

Name on other media ownership group that has pro-party, MUST-RUN segments as part of their daily operations - regardless of the the ethics or journalistic integrity of that content.
$C: It's a hypocritical script. The argument of the script is groups not being transparent in the attempt to push an agenda. Written by a company that isn't being transparent to push an agenda. 

There would be less problem is they did something like this segment is brought by our parent company Sinclair. 
$C: 1996.
$C: because unlike CNN, Sinclair has a stated, intentional bias.
$C: > It's always been like this

$C: People who ask their doctor if this prescription is right for them. 
$C: This isn't Fox doing this, it's Sinclair.
$C: Every station in this video is owned by Sinclair
$C: That was [DC's ABC7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WJLA-TV), not LA's channel 7. Autria Godfrey is a DC reporter.
$C: Why?

The parent company doing this is doing it in support of Trump.
$C: Actually got a chuckle out of me. I needed that. Now back into existential dread
$C: Go on 
$C: Gas Sinclair Broadcasting then, who are hardcore Trump supporters and the ones pushing this segment.
$C: “But it proves that the media was colluding FOR TRUMP”

$C: ...except Trump is about to give this guy more control over local stations. The swampmonster he appointed to lead the FCC has already changed anti-trust rules to help Sinclair and he is about to allow Sinclair to complete a merger that will give Sinclair 70% market share 
$C: Local news is just affiliates, they're funded by a right wing Trump supporter

$C: wrong reply box buddy, having read the comment string though, right on. that dude was a dick
$C: Yes, I imagine Communism and state run media would be much better.
$C: >The anchors are reading a corporate mission statement- of course they're all saying the same thing.

How is that not disturbing?

$C: The problem is that the exact same message is being spouted off by local newscasters and broadcast on local stations all over the country. This makes it appear to people in each of these localities as if it was a local statement in that specific area, when in reality it's one megacorporation speaking to them disguised as the intermediary they use to get the message across.
$C: Fuck off, troll
$C: So edgy!  Much anti-establishment and counter to the popular opinion!  Wow.  
$C: Watch it again.
$C: Because this is liberal Reddit and everything is Fox News’ fault. CNN is *real* news and can do no wrong. The left can’t admit that CNN=Fox News on the other side of the isle. 

$C: Nah, F 'em all. If it ain't Facebook news, I don't wanna hear it.
$C: Why are you feeling so attacked... stop making it personal and use your head its more rational than your emotions
$C: Yep, you're officially declared brain dead. You may want to slowly step back and stop drinking that Kool aid. 

Voting Republican had nothing to do with this any more than voting Democrat has to do with the 24/7 Russia, Trump, hooker, news stations like CNN, MSNBC, ABC, HuffPost, etc all collude on.
$C: this is what we've always had, they just weren't lazy enough to literally use the same script before
$C: They're actually talking about infowars / alexjones style news reporting. Basically the video is showing all these reporters talk about the dangers of getting your news from these "alternative" news sites, which leans republican. So, I think your premise is flawed, and that the guys in this video are basically spouting anti-Republican talk.
$C: - This hasn't been a "thing for decades."  If you have evidence that it has, feel free to provide it.

- Sinclair isn't left-leaning at all, they are significantly right-leaning.
$C: counter point fake news told you that Cnn was fakenews and you fell forit
$C: Sinclair is worse than CNN.
$C: If you worked for one of these stations, then you understand the difference between running a story from a wire service vs. reading a politically motivated script handed down from your conservative parent organization.

$C: You know that the Republican party constantly calls the U.S. a democracy too, right? All political figureheads will call us a democracy because it appeals the majority of people; that is not a party issue.
$C: That is the problem mate. Using news to get their subjective message through. It s called manipulation. 
$C: Not an echo chamber.  Its straight propaganda.   
$C: Just happened to be exactly in the opposite way you thought.
$C: The group who owns these news stations is right wing...guess who pushes the most fake news? The right. 
$C: And fox news is exactly what Trump watches everyday. He's getting his talking points from the echo chamber.
$C: You do know that these were all Fox News and cbs news stations, right?

Edit: apparently I missed a couple of other stations. Like nbc and abc
$C: "This propaganda proves what I wanted to believe in the first place! Scripted propaganda that denounces anything I don't believe is great! Hail dear leader!"
$C: Also... that's all local news... 
$C: Don’t understand why you are getting downvotes. Americans are retarded. 
$C: And here I was thinking the right was *against* censorship...
$C: i mean, it already got deleted and locked once. 
$C: ....I'm not sure you realize the irony of posting a link to the subbredit, and threaten mass censorship to prevent censorship. I want to be on your side, I also want to kick your stupid teeth in
$C: Username checks out 
$C: It's almost as if televised news is a different medium than an online forum and is subject to rules and regulations
$C: Now, I'm gonna suggest something, which might come as *somewhat of a shock* to you... but, have you ever considered that maybe, *just maybe*, Trump does enough stupid and harmful things to America on a daily basis that he deserves that kind of coverage? I know that might sound *crazy* to all of you Cadet Bone Spurs fan club members, but take it for a spin, see how it drives!    
      
      
         
        
Also, Happy Reddit Birthday, aka account creation day, and **congrats on your first comment!**
$C: You call the stories anti Trump; I call the stories pro America. 
$C: Local news isn't really what's typically referred to as the mainstream media.
$C: > Marketing people don't write the news. 

Yes, they do. Sinclair sends out "must air" segments featuring former members of Trump's campaign. TFOH with your "leftist" bullshit.
$C: God this conflation of “everyone does it” is such a fucking copout. The threat to our democracy is the propaganda spewed by the few news organizations that feel no obligation to report the truth. You aren’t some underground rebel with the real news, you’re just a pathetic incel that clings to right wing propaganda. You’ll go down believing it 
$C: Oh looky! A Cadet Bone Spurs fan club member giving a lecture on *leftists* and *groupthink*! Please, tell reddit more...
$C: YouTube is delayed
$C: Sinclair is a neo Nazis organization at this point
$C: We've known about it for a long time. John Oliver made a piece about this 8 months ago. No one wants this to happen it's just very difficult to stop this. And before you judge us and call us sheep you should know that this could happen in any country. It has before. 
$C: Okay. Tell us your plan. 
$C: But my family and friends are idiots
$C: ...or, find the quality stuff on all those platforms and verify with research of your own.  

Your family and friends are just as full of shit as your television and internet.  
$C: Ahh yes, trust my flat-earther aunt over a reputable scientific paper I found on the internet.
$C: Well accept in many cases your family and friends are completely wrapped up by the propaganda and spin. Better to say reach conclusions based on verifiable facts, not the obvious spin of biased pundits. As disturbing as that video was, it’s not like what they were saying was wrong. 
$C: yeah only trust your redneck family from Mississippi that never went to college lel
$C: But family and friends trust, TV, papers, internet ... Sooo
$C: You're a liar. 
$C: They're all owned by Sinclair who notoriously pushes a pro Trump agenda. Try again. 
$C: Congrats on the first comment :) just kidding. You're probably a robot.
$C: /r/im14andthisisdeep
$C: opposite, republicans dismantling net neutrality allowed sinclair group to purchase more stations
$C: Do you have any real criticisms of Trump, or just shallow centrism to validate your right agenda?
$C: >I have never seen the news report on a single good thing he has done

What specifically has the news failed to report on?  Tell me one positive thing Trump has done that was severely underreported on.
$C: Correct, These companies are FAKE NEWS that pushes MAGA. Glad to see you're paying attention! 
$C: you are aware that abc is owned by disney now right?
$C: then compile your own compilation and post it on r/videos 
$C: Yes, that's because they all come from a collective source. That's the problem. The voice of the billionaires who own the networks.
$C: Um no, they all read from the same script you bootlicking scumbag.
$C: > This is what happens when you select videos to edit together to make certain networks look bad.           

No amount of editing will ever be a substitute for the fact that these are separate local news outlets pushing a singular narrative that was supplied them by a 3rd party (Sinclair). 

> you can do the same with all the MSM news channels.       



No, you can’t. Because truly independent news outlet, even when covering the same story, will not mimic each other word for word  
$C: This is absolutely not the same. Reading the same AP source or something is common place in news journalism. This isn’t what that is. 
$C: Wait so why is this video a problem? What the anchors are saying is true...they want to stick to the truth of the stories. Are people wild up about it because one company gives all the stations they own the same script?
$C: EDIT: DISREGARD ME, I DID THE DUMB

while technically correct, arguing semantics kind of misses the point entirely. cant say I'm proud that most Americans dont know we arent part of democracy though.
$C: How did criticising mass corporate media become a red pill thing when it was such a focal point of Bernie's campaign?

Growing up it was RATM and Public Enemy
$C: That is incredibly [narrow sighted](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/10/ready-for-trump-tv-inside-sinclair-broadcastings-plot-to-take-over-your-local-news-1/)
$C: In this case, [it is because they're owned by the same company](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/business/media/sinclair-broadcast-komo-conservative-media.html).
$C: Yes, similarity in news stories is very common for reasons you pointed out. 

That's not what this is.

In this case, as another poster pointed it, this is exactly because they are owned by same company and told to read this exactly as written.
$C: > Please insert another 25cents, and try again.

What happens? Do you spout some more bullshit without thinking?
$C: Where exactly did you want me to insert this quarter?
$C: All of the networks shown here are pro-trump owned Sinclair Broadcast Group
$C: Anti Semite....how is abc or nbc or cbs communist?  I’ll wait 
$C: No it not, you don't really have a democracy.
$C: Agreed. I dont watch any of that bullshit, and yet I still have to hear about it. Seems like it is not working.
$C: One: all Sinclair.
$C: What?
$C: Still on top of mine.
$C: This is all Sinclair-owned stations who have "must-run" scripts as part of their programming.
$C: They are local stations in different networks. What they have in common is that they are all owned by the Sinclair Group, the broadcasting group that had an exclusive interview arrangement with Trump during the 2016 Presidential campaign.
$C: awareness of the Sinclair must-runs is imperative to help combat it
$C: The gist of it is conservative media conglomerate sinclair bought large portion of American local tv stations to disseminate republican/ trump propaganda. 
John oliver did a great segment about it, you should watch it [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GvtNyOzGogc)
$C: This is being uttered by the Fox News mini-mes 
$C: Most people over 50. 
$C: Baby boomers who still hold a lot of power and authority in various organizations, big and small.
$C: The same people who are most likely to vote, and are particularly susceptible to this kind of brainwashing.

Old people.
$C: It's meant to build trust with the viewer. Sinclair broadcasting is an extremely biased group. It's the highest level of hypocrisy. It's dystopian.
$C: Not "asked" to read it.  These are must-run segments.  Sinclair is notorious for forcing stations to air them.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/business/media/sinclair-broadcast-komo-conservative-media.html
$C: Except he was talking about the other media that didn’t follow this line on his behalf 
$C: pretty much....
$C: It's also important to realize when people are put forth false equivalencies like the idea that both sides were promoting fake news during the campaign season. That's just not true and blatantly misleading.
$C: Fake news was shared on both sides but was disproportionately shared among conservative pages.  Let's not pretend it was a 50/50 distribution.
$C: Or you just watch 1 local news station.
$C: 6 corporations control 90% of U.S. media and Sinclair isn't even one of them.

Sinclair has the potential to reach 40% of American households. Is that higher or lower than fucking DISNEY? 


$C: How should I be paying attention better?
$C: Which media outlets claims they are better/less biased besides Fox?
$C: > 1!

1! = 1

/r/unexpectedfactorial
$C: Sinclair Broadcast Group is buying up hundreds of local stations and sending them memos that they are required to read. Trump and Ajit Pai are going to help them buy up even more stations to monopolize the national market.

$C: No, it's **one** media group that owns all these stations. 
$C: [Sinclair](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/88m1y7/_/dwlpil0?context=1000)
$C: Stations affiliate with brands like Fox, Disney, etc. These ones are all owned by Sinclair Broadcasting, where this directive came from. 
$C: The New York Times and Washington Post primarily. NPR and PBS have very high quality objective news coverage as well.
$C: Papers and shit bro. Nyt, WaPo, business journals
$C: Don't trust one source, get your news from multiple sources. Check out what media is saying outside of your country and so on.
$C: nobody. assume everyone is trying to twist you.
$C: Nope, just everything owned by Sinclair apparently.
$C: [deleted]
$C: You must be drinking the koolaid by the gallon.
$C: >trying to control hundreds of media outlets, disqualify millions of voters, all while adding in fear and confusion to the mix

You do realize that is what both sides believe, right?
$C: We expect "journalists" to write their own scripts. If you sit in front of a TV camera and read a script that was sent to every major TV "news" station in the country, you are not a journalist, you are a propagandist. 

Is even one of them were an actual journalist, they would take the script, find out who wrote it, and who it was written for (who benefits from it), find out where the ideas came from (perhaps a political think tank? or international business group?), check the credibility and accuracy of the claims being made, and report THAT.

$C: Because it's extremely eyeopening? Maybe you suspected it, maybe you expected it, but seeing it head-on like this is something else.
$C: The hell?
$C: Well you must’ve been living under a Rock.

$C: It's not laziness.  These segments are must run as dictated by the parent company.
$C: > I’d like to see how popular a real “balanced” news station would be.

PBS? NPR? CBS?
$C: This is a script unique and specific to Sinclair stations, who have a stated, unapologetic pro-conservative directive - the likes of which no other major media group has (not even Fox News Channel has "must run" segments like Sinclair.)

What's new is Sinclair destroying local news credibility and trustworthiness.
$C: You're not only wrong, but it's been explained how you're wrong all over this thread. You may want to read a comment or two before commenting with such misplaced authority.

Sinclair has pro-party, MUST-RUN segments as a part of their daily operations. 

No other media ownership company does this. They have a daily requirement that stations run pro-Trump coverage - no matter what Trump is in the news for that day.
$C: Sinclair is conservative media
$C: Learned from the best Communists
$C: How? What company owns that many local news stations?  And what democratic campaign staffers are controlling the collective narrative? 
$C: Wat?
$C: Both are
$C: Might be the case if this were a cute cat video, but this is a must-run segment from Sinclair.
$C: They're pushing the "media is fake news" narrative which is a Trump talking point.

$C: Of?
$C: just sort by new
$C: Oh yeah?
$C: Well, they're not wrong. **Real** fake news *is* dangerous to our democracy. It's just ironic or hypocritical. The company is Sinclair Broadcasting group who has been known to make one-sided biased statements, yet they are so keen to claim one-sided biased statements are dangerous to our democracy.

Many stations saying the same thing is bad for the same reason. It can lead to widespread propaganda which is.... dangerous to our democracy.
$C: This is happening [because of Trump](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-campaign-sinclair-broadcasting-jared-kushner-232764).
$C: [Yep, spot on sir.](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/totals.php?id=D000029062&cycle=2018)
$C: Nothing like that since the AP is a cooperative, not-for-profit, and unincorporated news agency that was established by 5 independent news agencies. Furthermore, other news agencies that report AP stories attribute the story to the AP and aren't required to run anything from the AP. So there is no forced distribution there.  
$C: This. But fuck us for having common sense, right?!
$C: They didn't really tell people to fact check their news, it was just a tirade against the supposed "fake news" while painting themselves as unbiased.

If you can't recognize how that's dangerous, you're not the brightest crayon in the box.
$C: Why’d they try to make it look like a normal report though? If they said “and here’s a statement from our parent company Sinclair” nobody would be saying those things you’re mocking 
$C: Just Sinclair-owned media as far as we know. NPR is good stuff.
$C: So called mainstream and alternative are both owned and controlled by the same people.   Their goal is to pit us against each other so we won’t go after the true culprits.... the elite who rule over us. 
$C: ..protest?
$C: Well it just so happens that the company that owns all of these news stations, Sinclair media group, has shown quite a bit of support for the president. Imagine that.
$C: They are only Fox affiliates silly. Fox News has it's own owned and operated stations. 
$C: Why are you being a dick?
$C: Who’s spewing “fake news” bs again?
$C: ...please point to the left wing corporation that owns hundreds of local news outlets and forces them to regurgitate the same partisan propaganda...oh wait, you can’t. 


$C: Sinclair is a right wing media company try again
$C: Yea everyone knows Fox News is complete bullshit.
$C: jq
$C: Just Sinclair Broadcasting, which is a company with a right-wing agenda.

So Rush was only half right, and probably not in the way he was expecting.
$C: because they report the same facts?
$C: Again.
$C: Maybe make the littlest bit of effort to inform yourself then? Instead of assuming things and making statements based on those assumptions


$C: They just all wanted to make the same, biased point about how news companies are all repeating the same biased points.
$C: Because they are local affiliates, and not all of them Fox...you got some NBC, CBS, and ABC local affiliates, all owned by Sinclair running must runs.

Also, if you ever saw a "terror level" with the color bullshit on a local news station, especially after 9/11...it was owned by Sinclair media.

So yeah, when you assume your local news station is just going to run local news but is instead pushing extreme right ideologies because the parent corporation is trying to brainwash you using fear, people are going to be pissed when they find out.
$C: Did you even absorb *what* they're saying? That's the issue here, not the fact as such that they're all saying the same thing. You seem really dumb.
$C: So you haven’t actually informed yourself. This isn’t a “story”. This was a forced script from **the parent company**
$C: Its Sinclair-specific. No other outlet does or would do this.
$C: [deleted]
$C: except hamburgers don't have the ability to influence someone's political opinion...

$C: It's pretty true, scary as it sounds it's not hard at all to just Google up who owns these stations. 

Edit - I am agreeing with the video not with the above comment. I believe John Oliver touched on this same topic about who owns these companies.
$C: The company doing this is very pro-Trump.
$C: explain
$C: Way to completely miss the point. It's primarily about *what* they're saying
$C: Thing is it's not just politics, you can influence everything.. and they have and where being investigated on it.. paid advertising but they didn't disclose that.. very interesting.......
$C: Its Sinclair attempting to get the viewers to ignore any other sources of information/news and simply believe what they say. Its propoganda and an attempt to control the populace through biased news
$C: Yeah, so maybe the FCC conveniently changing regulations to allow Sinclair to own way, way more of these stations isn't the best idea. 
$C: There are markets for child pornography as well, but damn right I want to shut that down. 

Yes thats an exaggeration, just making a point. CNN isnt any better, propaganda is wrong, regardless of political affiliation.
$C: You may want to read up on the fourth estate and how vital it is to a functioning democracy 
$C: These are local news stations across many different networks. ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, etc.. This is not shared content, this is given to them as mandatory content to broadcast by their owner Sinclair media group, who have a well documented political agenda. It's a very dangerous path.
$C: How does this not look like anything?
$C: Your name is fitting
$C: ok sheepie pull off the wool over your eyes
$C: I like how this wasn’t political, it’s something the whole country can agree is fucked up.. and you make it political 
$C: Hmmm...but Trump just gave them the ability to monopolize local news stations which allows them to force anchors to read scripts like this. I doubt you’ll see that fact on t_d unless you catch the comment quick
$C: ...really
$C: Jewish mafia is real, would it be antisemitic to go after them?

If a group of elites is manipulating you against your better interests is that not something we can discuss.

I dont think its because they are Jewish, I think its because they are ultra rich and believe they have the only opinions that matter.
$C: Lol it’s been explained several times in the top comments.
$C: > A company, who actually doesn't report garbage ass fake news, but calls it out

All of these stations are owned by Sinclair, which is a very significantly right-wing company.  They're not "calling out fake news," they're trying to discredit any news that isn't their own.
$C: The fuckin nerve...you act like Trump and his Trumpeeons are spreading Fake News bullshit for over a year
$C: Because they are all condemning biased news while clearly pushing their own bias.
$C: What is funny is that this post didn’t mention any political side and yet you know who is it mainly about hm? 

Ironic but this issue is apparent for all media


$C: sure buddy its just them
$C: repeating phrases? dude they were repeating consecutive sentences like a monologue.
$C: Except in that case the 20 people discussing it were not given a script to read from.

$C: Don't mean to piggy back off your comment but I feel that this information should be visible to as many as possible since it forms and clarifies the bigger picture. This video is just the beginning compared to what Sinclair, Trump, and Ajit Pai have planned for their master plan. Take a look at all these articles and they're all timelined in order.

* **FEBRUARY 26, 2018**: FCC Commissioner: Policy custom built for Sinclair media. https://www.thedailybeast.com/fcc-commissioner-our-policy-is-custom-built-for-right-wing-sinclair-broadcasting
$C: WBMA - great station and folks prior to the acquisition. When the contracts of Spann, Baird, Huff, and others come up, it will be interesting to see who re-ups and who walks out of ethics concerns.

WBMA is a tricky situation because it was two separate stations in Tuscaloosa and Anniston prior to the Birmingham-Tuscaloosa-Anniston market consolidation. (Which placed in rank 40ish at the time.) It has several call letters for the license, but the Birmingham common call letters are WBMA, and it's known as ABC 33/40. 

WGWW (listed above) is part of that combo - it's the 40 in 33/40. WSES is the 33. It's all in the wiki link in the WGWW listing above.
$C: And WNWO, NBC 24 in Toledo, OH
$C: ABC 13 is also a station in Rochester, NY.  The anchor seen is *from Rochester*.  I do not believe [KTRK-TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTRK-TV) aka ABC 13 Houston has any connection to Sinclair media.

(edit: I decided not to name anchors, I can't be sure to identify everyone so I don't want to name just some.)
$C: Republicans don’t give a shit about the free market. They’re extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: Yeah. KTLA here in Los Angeles as well. The most popular news station in LA, my favorite station. Gotdamnit this sucks. 
$C: They have WSYX and WTTE, our ABC and Fox channels here in Columbus, Ohio.
$C: "*Ohoohhhh nooooo,* don't don't stop watching your daily *programming*!"

(it's also used as the 4th video from the left on the second row of the videos in the [6x6 screen](https://youtu.be/hWLjYJ4BzvI?t=35).)
$C: Do you recognize the anchor?  Sinclair owns two Fox28 stations, WTTE in Columbus, OH and WTGS in Hardeeville, SC.  I looked up their station anchor lists and believed I found a match at the one in South Carolina.
$C: That's funny, so does mine...

The Act, **signed by President Bill Clinton,** represented a major change in American telecommunication law, since it was the first time that the Internet was included in broadcasting and spectrum allotment.[1] One of the most controversial titles was Title 3 ("Cable Services"), which allowed for media cross-ownership
$C: Compared to a socialist or communist state where only government approved news can be published.
$C: Idk what ur watching but half the news is still feel good crap
$C: I hear that's extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: One company controlling the vast majority of news on this country and telling everyone to ignore all the other news because they're liars is damn near the fucking definition of a reason to be concerned.

If someone says "believe me", or "trust me"?

#DON'T.
$C: Patriotism is a fool's blindfold.
$C: At first I thought you meant we are way better at propaganda than Russia. 
$C: When you say better do you mean more subtly and not as obvious as Russia? Because from Europe America feels like it's a giant cult fed by it's news outlets. Seriously I don't know anyone that goes around saying they love their country that's just weird.
$C: Are we better than russia? Or are we told that we are?
$C: I studied abroad in England in 2004.  I remember watching BBC news and thinking that it reminded me of what news used to sound like when I was a kid, before 9/11 and before cable news took over.  It sounded serious and demanded respect.
$C: Yes! Yes you do! Why is the military involved in every football game? As a non American this struck me the most.
$C: I'm no Trump supporter, but i've definitely gotten the vibe the media's been like this about him. 
$C: Russia is also a cash fueled system, same as ours.
$C: Viewing yourself in a positive light isn't propaganda. You're just wanting to be a collective narcissist with the rest of the group here. 
$C: They murder, extract, and suppress gays. We do it for blacks and latinx and poor gays.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: How are you way better than Russia? In Russia this kind of propaganda is impossible, because they couldn't have executed it.
$C: Funny.. I'm constantly checking with my Russian friend for *real* information -- education, science, medicine, history... It's all fucked.

$C: Well, we're definitely on the way.
$C: This type of thing is not outlawed in other first world countries. Many other countries have this as well, Canada being a good example. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_media_ownership

$C: It used to be outlawed in ours. There used to be strict limits on how many stations any one company could own in a given market. The Clinton administration did away with that in the '90s.
$C: On Australia, you can’t buy a newspaper that isn’t a Murdoch paper in most newsagents anymore
$C: Name a country. 
$C: I understand your premise... but could you expand on your justification?

What do you find inherently offensive about a company that produces popular content expanding to meet market requirements?


$C: I tend to feel the same way, but then I remember that so many humans have been corrupt, selfish, and ignorant for thousands of years, and yet we still somehow managed to progress despite it all. 

Although I don't think we'll ever have a utopian society that is free of corruption or human suffering. There will always be dysfunction
$C: Capitalism is also responsible for our major technological advancements, though. Competition drives innovation.

Capitalism is necessary, but it has to be regulated. The conservative and libertarian belief that the free market will regulate itself is a delusion.
$C: So how do you make sure the ones who hold the keys to public funding won't be corrupt? What you're suggesting is limiting press freedom. Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini, Mao, the Kim dynasty, Hussein, they all loved that idea too.
$C: > This is not due to cash

Isn't it, though?

Special interests have bought off conservative politicians to get rid of the regulations and tax systems that are costing them money. This propaganda is designed to keep those politicians in office. It's all about money.


$C: [deleted]
$C: There is absolutely crime within the military but much of it only goes punished when it is exposed (if at all given how willing we are to redefine terms to forgive war crimes or straight up ignore them). Military rule will only promote the interests of the military leadership, the public must retake and reorganize control over society to promote the interests of *all* people.
$C: Some would say so, yes.

But others might say that it is EXTREMELY dangerous to your democracy 
$C: Fuck yea it is. I was just about to say that. 
$C: You don't have a democracy. You have a dictatorship of capital, where your media, government and laws are controlled by a small elite of wealthy oligarchs.

Well, general public is to blame. You think news is free? The only free news you get is this shit.

$C: Apply directly to the forehead!
$C: I would echo that. 
$C: Democracy ? What democracy.

$C: CBC isn't government run its funded through public funding. That's it. 
$C: Ugh.
$C: No, the standardization is what's scary. The mechanism that allows one group to control this much media is what's scary. Don't try to pin this only on Sinclair, like if we get rid of them the problem is solved.

That's how you sidestep an issue and let it get worse.
$C: They're both a symptom of the same problem. Our anti-monopoly safeguards have been slowly eroded in the intervening time since the 1930s. 
$C: >  I really hate what it's done to local radio stations

$C: > realise everything they hear about US politics from the media is completely fabricated?

You're getting the exact wrong message from this. MSNBC, CNN, The New York Times, The Washington Post, etc. aren't colluding on their message and their reporting isn't fabricated.

The video that you're commenting on is trying to paint those media outlets as fake news by forcing all of their affiliates to repeat this script.

The "mainstream media" is not the enemy here. Sinclair broadcasting is a conservative group in moderate's clothing, trying to do to local news networks what groups like them did to the talk radio scene. Flooding it with conservative news and opinions until everything else is gone.
$C: 53k upvotes. It’s here to stay!

EVA
$C: I dont see how F society could ever protect us against this.
$C: That was the scariest fucking episode.
$C: [removed]
$C: Ok you have our attention. But, open question: what do you think this is actually a demonstration of? What in your mind are we looking at?
$C: Because it means the guy at the top can make all these stations say exactly what he wants them to say, verbatim, and everyone listening thinks it's the "news" anchor's own personal opinion. People are more likely to trust it, despite anchors being forced to say exactly what they're being told. It's extremely dangerous to our democracy. It has nothing to do with accuracy or integrity of reporting, it's just parroting propaganda.
$C: A LOT of people trust their local news more than mainstream media ie; CNN, msnbc, fox, so on and so fourth.

Being able to own say 31 major city's local news network, means you can push an agenda out, it will reach probably 5x more viewers than MSM, and will stick with the viewers more since they trust the news station they grew up with. 

It's quite genius really, let's make MSM seem like the fake news, and seem local news is more honest, and run a propaganda agenda through the local news.
$C: It looks like the beginning of a black mirror episode. It's really fucking sad this is real life right now.   
  
Edit: real instead of realize. 
$C: We have to fight for our democracy by voting in the 2018 midterms in November! 

We need to break up big companies like Google, Amazon, Sinclair Broadcasting, the Koch group, the Mercer group, etc. Business interests have been slowly eroding the protections created in the New Deal. It's time for another one. 
$C: Every repetition of that line ramped up the horror I was feeling by another degree. It's not often that I get that as a visceral reaction to things happening in real life.
$C: And it will be all but forgotten by social media in 3...2..
$C: *All of which are American dreams,*
$C: After about the 7th time the context of that statement started to change. It's not the fake news that is dangerous it's that they forced all those news stations to give that speech.
$C: They should have ended that video-piece with **one** word taken from each voice, and added together in a single sentence:

 "This"... "is" ... "extremely"... "dangerous"... "to" ... "our" ... "democracy."
$C: Couldn’t have ended the video any better
$C: I've seen this done before, but I can't remember where.

Sometimes you have to love a blatant and intentional lack of subtlety to point out the blatant obvious level of the problem.
$C: One wonders how much analysis they did in determining which presenters people would be most "receptive" to in each time slot, in each city...
$C: More like a [70-88 pound bar spinning at 1500 RPM](https://youtu.be/f8D6J4Q6cQM)
$C: Rush Limbaugh has been doing this for years. To show how biased the news media really are. 
$C: 20 pounds = 9,07 kg 
$C: Thissastreemly dangerous ta'our democracy. 
$C: Jesus fucking Christ, I read your comment right as they all said that.  I'm gonna have these goosebumps for the rest of my life...
$C: Thought that feel like some black mirror shit 
$C: *pound
$C: they know the power of information, no wonder they want to get rid of net neutrality 
$C: That right there made me change my mind from “these anchors actually do journalism and are more than just reading off a TelePrompTer” to “what a joke!”

I think I’ll continue on my path of gathering news elsewhere. They seem to catch trending reddit stories 3-5 days after they are hot anyways. 
$C: Just 20?
$C: When one voice becomes too loud others cannot be heard.

We should never forget about the least common denominator and as far as I'm concerned, that's everyone.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our hypocrisy 
$C: What I love about ending it like that with that phrase repeating is it makes it seem as if the reporters just know, know what they’re doing is bullshit and know that it is “extremely dangerous to our democracy.” Lol
$C: 20 pounds? Rookie, in my day we pounded with 100 pounders all day
$C: It's funny because they are right Sinclair Media is a national security threat 
$C: Drives the point home so well. I'm relieved a subject like this got it good
$C: The equivalent of school yard. “Stop hitting yourself, stop hitting yourself.” 
$C: Or 20 one pound hammers...
$C: More like a jackhammer.
$C: What democracy do we have?......
$C: That really affected me. I would never trust a news station that says that.
$C: Head On.. Applied Directly to the Forehead

Head On.. Applied Directly to the Forehead

Head On.. Applied Directly to the Forehead
$C: Reminds me of Rage Against the Machine
$C: I liked that one guy who fucked up and was like “this is extremely dangerous our democracy”
$C: I’m high right now and those words being repeated by all those different people gave me a fucking existential panic attack.
$C: Getting your news from alternative sources is extremely dangerous to our corporate influence over the masses.
$C: The writers and editors are the same entity. They hijacked the narrative to expose fake news. 
$C: I'm pretty fucking blazed right now and it hit me through the haze so yeah 60 pound sledge there
$C: This was actually illegal at one point in the US as part of the Soviet era prevention measure against communism.  Ironically we now have news just like any other communist nation.  Censored and run by the very politicians and big hats that took over countries like Russia and China.
$C: Too bad we are a Republic.

$C: Syncing audio is so easy assistant editors do it.  The hard part is knowing America is fucked. 
$C: And doing it without losing their mind, no less. (I suppose, we actually don't know they haven't)
$C: There an app that does it quick and easy: https://www.redgiant.com/products/pluraleyes/
$C: Editor here! While it was well done it's not as difficult as you might think. For example, the more elaborate scene [here](https://youtu.be/hWLjYJ4BzvI?t=35) was probably done by first just finding that line said on each of the videos. Then lining all the tracks up so they play at the same time at the beginning of the sentence.

From there you just reduce that scale so they line up and fit in the screen one by one, this can be done with simple math or guessing, and then just trim each of the tracks forward by a second or two so they appear one by one.

Now, of course, different people speak in different tones, afflictions, and paces so that's why you can't seem to understand it past a certain point because they all become out of order. Tops half an hour of work. *Not trying to discredit the editor btw, they did a great job*.
$C: I have seen a bit like this in Jon Oliver, but this one gave me chills.

This made me feel trapped. 
$C: > yea for real. syncing up all that video and audio is impressive

Whoever put this together must have been doing a whole lot of smiling once they found the same "gotcha" soundbytes time and time again for each station.

$C: I've said this a few different times in this thread, but that's not the same thing.

The stations in the Conan segment are taking pieces from a newsgathering service that provides videos and scripts.  They're just too lazy to rewrite them before plugging them into their newscasts, but no one is forcing them to air those stories.  They just all picked that one because they thought their viewers would be interested in it.

The stations in this video are being forced to read a statement by their parent company.
$C: This just reminds me that I should never watch TV... Haven't had one or watched a TV channel for 5 years now. Reddit is also biased as fuck though so I don't even know if I'm better of. 

(Should it be "better off" or "better of"? English isn't my first language.)
$C: John oliver also did me thinks
$C: I like this one because it's specifically about the dangers of one-sided or biased media. 
$C: The above poster was specifically commenting on the editing, which is in a completely different style between Conan's videos and the posted video. 

The posted video is using editing much more effectively than Conan to emphasize the message.
$C: Connan O'brien just pushed the envelope on late night television.﻿


$C: Huh, just occurred to me that people pronounced envelope differently. IN-velope and ON-velope.
$C: This is not the same as what Sinclair is doing.
$C: Yeah, the ending is perfect
$C: This is good for bitcoin
$C: Good theory. 

It's beyond me how they had access to this many videos. I was figuring it was the work of a group of people; which would be an inspiring display of team work. That, or somebody at the corporate office whose seen the script.

But a few days later Trump will say something controversial and Reddit will forget all about how this is extremely dangerous to our democracy.

There was no copying. It was the script they were sent from Corporate. They had zero say in it. If you've worked for any major world wide company this smacks true of any missive sent down the ladder from on high that carries forced involvement.

$C: > Well, this video exists now and they can't really undo that.

Why would they try to hide it? Sinclair has been very bold and unapologetic about this "MUST RUN" approach to their biased messaging. It's well published and much-maligned by the industry. 

I'm glad that Joe Average is becoming aware of it - better sooner than later. What you saw from the linked video provide by OP is just the start of Sinclair's shameful campaign approach. John Oliver covered it already. 

And if Sinclair gets it's hooks into Tribune media like they're trying for, it will be absolutely catastrophic. 
$C: What if I told you the same group who edited the video also wrote the script. 
$C: Exactly, this is what happens when a single family is allowed to own an undue share of local news stations. The FCC recently repealed a regulation that limited the number of local stations one company could buy. We need to vote in the 2018 midterms for people who enact antitrust legislation!
$C: Marching orders.
$C: That seems very defeatist.  I think identifying propaganda and showing people how it works and what it looks like is the first step to making it less powerful.  
$C: Something *was* done to prevent this, which the FCC had to remove in order for it to happen.

If it can be done once, it can be done again. Assuming people can enough to vote, that is. 
$C: Shooooo. Cheer up, guy
$C: > most people who watch these channels don't really care.

Boycott the local businesses that are talked into ad campaigns on Sinclair stations. Let the business know in a respectful way that you're doing so and why. 

Sinclair will fold without local ad dollars - especially if they're going to the competition along with the eyeballs/ratings from those same persons.
$C: [deleted]
$C: That's why many of them look extremely sad.
$C: This is *extremely* dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Sinclair (conservative outlet) and "Must Runs". They're very open and arrogant about it. There are lots of articles from multiple reliable, trustworthy source littering a Google search on the topic. 

They've been open about this for a while and people are just now seeing it in full effect.
$C: > They're doing to our media what was done to our public transportation system.

"They" is Sinclair. This isn't lazy, and it isn't coincidence - this is blatant, and openly stated by Sinclair. They're not even _trying_ to hide it. Google up Sinclair and bias and you'll get all of the nasty details.
$C: Us forget about it. I can't correct auto correct. Sorry. 
$C: Nope - watch the daily news casts. 

Sinclair has MUST RUN pieces each day that are intentionally written to cover the actions of conservative politics in a positive light. 

Compare the same coverage between any Sinclair station and any other station (non-Sinclair) in the same market - doubly so if you can get more than one non-Sinclair station. 

Compare the stories, priority (where they appear in the broadcast) and the content of the coverage.

Sinclair stations will run pro-GOP coverage while the other stations will simply educate and inform - good or bad - for whomever is the subject. 
$C: Maybe, but he's basically a propagandist himself.
$C: Not when the script is written and mandated by Sinclair HQ. 

It's exactly the same because Sinclair told their stations to record and air it exactly as written. Additionally, they have daily Must Run news stories that enforce the same rules. 

These must runs are pro-GOP pieces intentionally designed to take the focus off of negative coverage of events that may be surrounding GOP actions or politicians.
$C: This has nothing to do with collusion.
$C: "This is extremely dangerous to our Democracy."

"No, ***THIS*** is extremely dangerous to our Democracy."

*constant loop*
$C: Token really sold it for me 
$C: It was kinda creepy tbh. 



These people are actively trying spending *billions of dollars* for the sole purpose of influencing and perhaps deceiving you. 
$C: We've all been a bit lazy when it comes to defending our democracy. There's still time to fix things, though. Make sure to vote in the 2018 midterms this November. Vote for politicians who will rein these companies back in. 
$C: It's like they are hypnotists and the use "democracy" as a trigger word to persuade and reprogram whoever's watching...

Let me go get my tin-foil hat...
$C: Good, stop following the piper and defend your rights.
$C:  Nope it’s pretty clear. 

The gop agenda is backed by crooked manipulative money driving their agenda through the media. 

The Deep State is the GOP make no mistake. 
$C: That’s a good thing.
$C: Yeah. Makes me think everything is cool with Facebook now and people are trying to divide us
$C: Which is still a win for many right wing movements. If you cant flat out get them int he cult at least confuse them so much it doesnt matter. 
$C: This is extremely good for our democracy! 
$C: Good, anyone who hasn't been questioning everything needs to start doing it. It's time for everyone to wake up. The the light is starting to shine on every dark little corner of the earth. 
$C: You need to get out more this is nothing new. 
$C: that laugh track was creepy

$C: This child's happiness is extremely dangerous to our democracy.

https://youtu.be/GiCaqA0ngRc
$C: When it’s in the story and not a commentary like OP’s video, it is likely not as...well, dangerous to our democracy. It’s likely just really lazy producers taking lines word-for-word from the wires.
$C: Man, American news presenters are fucking creepy.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our child's happiness democracy.
$C: Dis is esstreemly dainjrous to R. D'Markus see? (1:30 ish)
$C: We have elements from both. They are not mutually exclusive. 
$C: This is the dumbest thing I've read on reddit today.
$C: Actually, it's not democrats or republicans doing this, per se, it's alarmist absolutism and placing all of the blame on the other, with no room for nuanced discussion... and that just increases the polarization, but it gets clicks.
$C: Ehhhh let's not blanket that. You can be a conservative and hate where your party is heading, or a democrat and peddle opinion as fact. No one is immune to bias 
$C: Yes, brother, we've always been at war with ~~Eastasia~~ Republicans.
$C: if you really believe that, you are a shining example that this kind of shit has worked. democrats absolutely obscure the truth for party politics the same way republicans do. stop fighting your common man, and fight the people with money and power, no matter what side of the aisle they claim to be from.
$C: Hell I don't like that the rules have been changed to the point that either party (or even a 3rd party) could gain this much control over what people hear as 'news' with enough money behind them.

$C: PFft hahaha keep telling yourselves that. Conservative shilled for hillary during the election. ? Hahahahahahah
$C: I would change that to American "conservatism" or at least elaborate on it because I've never seen any other center-right parties anywhere in G20 nations become extreme right wing within a period of 10/20 years. Be it Merkel's party in Germany or even UK's even though they've formed alliances, it's still very similar to what it was before. 

Also that **healthy** fiscal conservatism (not to be confused with anach-capitalism/Ayn Randism) is probably needed in a working democracy where capitalism is shown to work for the most part. 

$C: Hate to tell you this, but both sides of the uni-party were involved.

Bill Clinton and a Republican-majority congress paved the way for this with this law:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996
$C: I do see a lot of Democrats enabling the far right though. Standard leftist policies are lauded as ponies by corporate Democrats who say we must negotiate with the far right. They also enable them by extending the Patriot Act, supporting war, increasing the military budget, ignoring income inequality, voting in Trump nominees, etc. 
$C: It's only a bad thing when the stations are forced to air it whether they want to or not.
$C: Hey, you better watch it.

Your comment is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: I don't understand this video either. Yes, our media establishment is terrible (and so is the rest of the establishment)... but it isn't in *this* instance. 
$C: That's not what this is.

Stations do use newsgathering services that provide videos and scripts they can plug into their newscasts.  Many of them don't bother changing the script for each story, so they end up reading the same thing verbatim across different stations.

What's in this video is a "must-run" segment from Sinclair.  Stations are forced to air this; they don't have a choice.
$C: Normal to do Nazi propaganda paid for by Sinclair propaganda by dog whistling presidential talking point.

Yeah, not normal. Gas lighting.
$C: They also got a sweetheart deal from Ajit Pai's FCC to continue buying up markets. They are owned by a highly conservative family that wants to create a "conservative megaphone."

edit:

From a [NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/technology/fcc-media-ownership-rules.html) describing the deal:

>The Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday announced plans to eliminate decades-old media ownership rules meant to protect local coverage and diversity in media voices.

>The commission’s chairman, Ajit Pai, said in a congressional hearing that the agency would vote in November to roll back rules that prevent ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station in the same market. **The rules were created to prevent an individual or organization from having outsize influence over public opinion.**

>**But in the hearing, where he faced fierce criticism by Democratic lawmakers, Mr. Pai defended the plan and other deregulatory actions in recent months**, saying media ownership rules were outdated. They were created 42 years ago, when newspapers and television stations dominated the media landscape, well before Facebook and Google.

>“The marketplace today is nothing like it was in 1975,” Mr. Pai said.

>It was the latest action by Mr. Pai, who was appointed by President Trump in January, to overhaul the media industry. Since Mr. Pai has taken the top seat at the F.C.C., his deregulatory actions have ushered in the possibility of consolidation in the broadcast television industry.

>In the spring, **soon after he lifted a cap on how many stations a single company can own, the Sinclair Broadcast Group announced its intention to buy Tribune Media** for $3.9 billion. The merger, which the F.C.C. and the Department of Justice are reviewing, **would give Sinclair access to more than *70%* of all television viewers in the United States.**

It is anti-competitive and anti-democratic for one family to have this much control of local news. 

2nd edit:

[John Oliver's segment about Sinclair Broadcasting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvtNyOzGogc&feature=youtu.be)
$C: John Oliver did a great episode on Sinclair a while ago. It was first time I came to know about them.

Edit:[source](https://youtu.be/GvtNyOzGogc)
$C: As someone who works at a Tribune station soon to be purchased... it's awful. 
$C: Fuck shit pai
$C: KOKH-TV OKC Fox 25 [Fox] is owned by Sinclair
KFOR-TV Oklahoma's News 4 [NBC] & KAUT-TV Freedom 43 [Ind] are both owned by Tribune
$C: They're going to own 3 of the 5 major network affiliates in my city once that deal goes through...
$C: [deleted]
$C: The local fox station here in San Diego is a Tribune station.  I've already told everyone I know to stop watching them since it's soon to be a Sinclair station.
$C: Also they keep strongarming media providers to jack up prices, and the consumer pays the price, monetarily and by losing their channels to blackouts. 
$C: holy shit. i thought the 200 stations was after the tribune deal.
$C: Also buying out the FCC, which would give them a whole lot more.
$C: And what role is Soros playing in all this?

Woosh
$C: [deleted]
$C: You should take a gander at who owns the major radio stations where you live.   If there's more than 4-5 companies (for say, 12 stations?) I'll be amazed.
$C: For now.
$C: They got my Fox and CW, i saw this ad run yesterday morning during the news.
$C: Well, the stations sinclair does not own; are likely owned by 1 of 5 other similar companies.  There was a time when 50 companies could bring you the news, we boiled it down to 6.

edit: Independent Media is the way to go everyone
$C: Don’t worry, your local news is owned by a different multi billion dollar corporation!
$C: Welp, my current city and the last one I was in are both on it :P
$C: Can you please state your city? No we are not planning on an expansion. This is extremely important for your democracy.
$C: Just made a similar reply what the fuck is this censorship about
$C: Uber liberal Portland is on that list (KATU 2), so nowhere is safe from the conservative megaphone.
$C: The own one channel I watch and I only watch it for soccer so I'm good.
$C: The rest of them are part of another big-company too
$C: mine, and all of my families (they live out of town, and out of state) are on this list. This is the most terrifying thing ive seen in awhile.
$C: They own my local ABC affiliate, not that I watch much broadcast television or news 
$C: Just don't watch local or national news and you never have to worry about it.
$C: A little disturbed mine was, I don't watch the news but I wonder if they do this shit too
$C: Two of my local news stations are. Ugh. 
$C: If it's not Sinclair, its Nexstar or Gray. 
$C: the FCC is in the process of lifting the national households reached cap from 39% to 72%.  It will be.
$C: Mine was
$C: Your city’s stations could be owned by another company. There’s a few companies just like Sinclair. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Then yours is owned by [Nextstar Media.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stations_owned_or_operated_by_Nexstar_Media_Group)
$C: I was confident mine wasn’t either... and they have like all of our stations
$C: highly suspicious isnt it? 120k upvotes and it doesnt show up.
$C: Both of my local news stations are on that list. This is actually quite eye opening and terrifying.
$C: Thanks for the mirror
$C: POSTS SHUT DOWN

EVERYONE KNOWS IT. WHAT'S GOING ON?

THREADS REAPPEAR. WHY NO ANSWERS?
$C: This started a long time ago. Go research the Telecommunications Act of 1996
$C: 72% is beyond a monopoly. WTF.
$C: We can reverse this travesty by voting in the 2018 midterms elections this November! Vote for people who support stronger antitrust legislation and the closing of bullshit loopholes! Vote!
$C: > Fuck Ajit Pai.

I'd say it's the people who back him. Especially the one that put him as the head of the FCC. 


>The United States' largest owner of television stations, Sinclair Broadcast Group, mandated that its outlets run a segment on the so-called deep state that was produced by a former reporter for the Russian propaganda outlet RT, according to a new report.

http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/07/media/sinclair-broadcasting-promos-media-bashing/index.html
$C: That's right. Who enabled Pai? Trump. This is [his propaganda network](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/88kdz9/watch_in_unison_sinclairs_local_stations_denounce/dwlc79x/)
$C: It was like that well before trump and ajit
$C: it's still kind of surreal how big of a douche nozzle he is. like wow. I mean we all know he's bought and payed for, but then he just flaunts it because, why not, this is the fucking world we live in. It's pretty fucking silly.

It will be cool once the blue wave rolls all the way through and we clean out as many of these weasels as we can. 
$C: [Fuck Ajit Pai](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7jxtrv/friday_fun_offtopic_megathread/drab96b/) 

$C: Yeah, this has basically nothing to do with Ajit Pai or anyone currently in office. 
$C: Fuck /u/xiaxian1 and their fake news post. This was long before the Trump organization and Ajit Pai. Seriously tho comments as yours is why people will continue supporting GOP and Trump. The average person knows full well this has been going on for years before Trump. Once you try to blame it on Trump and only Ajit Pai your point is invalid and look like like a leftist idiot. Fact is this is a problem over 20 years in the making and neither side has stopped it. 
$C: Speaking of PBS, this is their take on Sinclair broadcasting

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNhUk5v3ohE
$C: How long before Sinclair, Kochs, Mercer, et al tell the GOP to shut them down?
$C: ~~Is PBS national? I always wondered if you guys had a government run station like our CBC or UKs BBC. I assume not because American people typically want fewer things in the hands of the government. Some conservatives find CBC left-slanting, but I've not really picked up on that.~~ NVM I looked it up :P They are a national programmer!

Anyways, I remember PBS fondly for running the *Red Dwarf* marathons back in the 90s. Taped those and ran the VHS to death. 

Edit: Strikethrough
$C: I can't stand NPR anymore.  Since mid-Obama term, they've been nearly as left as FOX is right.

Albeit with less paranoid crazy ranting.  Still leaning hard with headlines, article prose, and discussion on air.

$C: While I feel like acusing a man of being a Putin supporter because he is Russian is a bit of a stretch, the fact they force all their stations to air commentary from someone who actively supports Donald Trump and then have to gall to talk about how fake and misleading news is damaging American democracy by splitting people apart is disgusting. 
$C: It's not Russia all the way down, put down your tin foil hat. Actually realize that this is pure corporate propaganda by this conservative family (although sides don't matter), and that you have to attack THEM. if you keep attacking Russia Sinclair will just laugh their asses off. You'd be helping them. 
$C: They tend to be actually owned by CBS Corp, Disney, 20th Century Fox, and NBCUniversal. The ad revenue is so great, those companies don't mind having to fund the local news studios when you're dealing with 10M+ in your market. It's not worth selling off to a company like Sinclair who will take the crumbs of the smaller cities and try to produce as cheaply as possible.
$C: The stations know. They can’t do anything but find new jobs...but as the ownership pool shrinks...

You should be writing the FCC and your Senators/Reps and expressing how much you don’t want the Trib/Sinclair deal, other deals, or this type of push from ownership to happen. 

The folks at the stations will quietly give you a fist bump. 
$C: They do have strict rules (as do most ownership groups) restricting the employees from donating, though. Unless it’s management that wants to donate to a certain PAC...that was a fun headline. 

They also have strict rules against even their non-on-air staff from tweeting/posting views...let’s just say the ownership doesn’t agree with. 
$C: They currently reach about 70% of the potential audience in the country. There are 210 markets (cities and surrounding areas that a signal reaches) and 3-5 stations doing news in each. Sometimes, there are Fox, CW, or MyNetwork stations also in those markets doing news, but not always. They’re also often paired in ownership with one of the big three (ABC, NBC, CBS). While those are technically duopolies, they’re not looked at with the same side-eye if the local Fox only airs Judge Judy reruns and the Simpsons, with no local news production.  Some cities, like Indianapolis, have competitive CW and Fox affiliates with local news casts, as well as the big three. 
$C: No worries. If the CW affiliate in your area isn’t owned by Sinclair, you’re safe. Affiliation and station ownership are separate things. 
$C: In rural areas, younger folks (30yo) do. Broadband hasn’t kept up, streaming isn’t so strong, they need to know the weather for the commute to work the next day. So they do watch for that stuff and get fooled into a nonsense segment along the way. Then, it deepens the Urban/Rural divide. 
$C: The actual channels are the affiliates. But no, they don’t own CBS (Viacom), NBC (Comcast Universal), ABC (Disney). They just pay a crapload of money to air their prime time programs and national newscasts. 
$C: Or contacting your DC representation. That’s the biggest way. Make a stink about it to Senators, write the FCC. Let them know what you want, as the whole point of the FCC is to maintain good stewardship of the PUBLIC’s airwaves. 
$C: Yes. 

I know they're even trying to buy the Tribune station here in New York City WPIX. If that happens, you could see a mass Exodus.
$C: Russians. The chief political talking head for Sinclair is a Russian

$C: Nothing's complementary in 'Murica, ya damn commie. 😏
$C: I find your comment to be extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: **VERY** Orwellian. It's scary watching it.

Edit: Why was this thread locked and deleted?!

$C: It felt Black Mirror-y. Even without the pig. 
$C: It's Sinclarian.
$C: Not kind of, it is Orwellian, this is exactly as he predicted. It's happening, don't think otherwise. It's time we start defending our rights.
$C: Double good. 
$C: Very Orwellian.
$C: Yeah, it is but they bought up all of these local stations and now they can dictate what and what not they can say. It's literally is scary that they are pushing this narrative but Trump's FCC allowed Sinclair to buy all of these stations. Remember vote and voting does have consequences, like the eroding of the news through the ability to buy out local stations and force them to say your company's mantra. 
$C: I’m pretty sure Sinclair owns all of them. The worst part is that they are trying to buy even more news stations to peddle more right wing talking points to more Americans. 
$C: We have always been at war with Eastasia!
$C: There's no "kinda" about it.
$C: just going to go ahead and upload this to Orwell. Annnnnddddd done!
$C: Right?

 I find this just just really upsetting. It’s like propaganda.
$C: imagine a boot stamping on a human face, forever
$C: I swear in the last 3 or 4 years thing have silently been taking a sharp downturn. So many alarming facts and statistics i've been hearing lately. Hard to tell what's real and what's just a fabrication.
$C: Just wait til Reddit takes it down for being political.
$C: I wish people would stop using that word to describe anything remotely creepy.
$C: No, the news and media are your friend and have your best interests in mind.


$C: Kind of?
$C: [Borg-ian.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjFE0sTNeg) 
$C: Kind of?

$C: And now, let’s repeat the Non-Conformist Oath!
1.	I promise to be different. 
2.	I promise to be unique. 
3.	I promise not to repeat things other people say. 
$C: It's not merely Orwellian. It is Orwell precisely replicated.
$C: THEY ARE CONDITIONING US
$C: No, Orwellian.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. (Blinks out send help fast)
$C: ya think
$C: r/accidentalorwellian
$C: Extremely
$C: Extremely Orwellian 
$C: Yep. Right up to the point where you realize the only people watching the local news are 60+ years old and still read the newspaper.
$C: Just kind of? 


Using authoritative speakers to deliver a message and gas-lighting opposing opinions to consolidate control over information is 100% Orwellian. 


Only difference is Orwell predicted this would happen with government/military centered power, not corporate power.


It's an Orwellian-Corpritocracy I suppose. 
$C: Kind of lolol.
$C: "Kind of ”
$C: Kind of? More like completely.
$C: Who watches nightly news anyway?
$C: Yeah. Not even a little ‘kinda’.
$C: Kind of GOPish......oh, same thing.

welcomed to fucked.
$C: Speaking of which, did this just get nuked from the top of /r/all? It's not there anymore, it was the top post when I saw it...
$C: The fact that this of all thing is what scares you is a little ridiculous. Sure it’s creepy seeing the same message repeated for multiple local stations but did you actually listen to what they were saying? The message was completely on point. 

The dissemination of “facts” through social media without proper vetting - a platform that reaches millions more than a local news station AND has largely a user base that is young and impressionable - is the actually Orwellian prospect. 


$C: double plus ungood
$C: Orwellian was the first thing that came to mind especially after hearing "this is extremely dangerous to our democracy" over and over.
$C: War is Peace

Freedom is Slavery

Ignorance is Strength


$C: This is double plus un-good for our Democracy
$C: Not kind of ... It is the DEFINITION of Orwellian.


$C: How?
$C: Oldthinkers unbellyfeel Amsoc. 
$C: Also getting a strong Atlas Shrugged vibe.. fucking cronies.
$C: Incredibly American. 
$C: Kinda real, oops not kinda real hey retard you are living now
$C: Kind of? 
$C: It absolutely is. It’s “The Ministry of Truth”, the propaganda machine that Stanley works at in 1984. They call it The Ministry of Truth even though their main goal is to censor, alter or completely fabricate news stories. All you have to do is say you’re spreading truth, while identifying the *fake news* you’re opposed to, and most people won’t know the difference.
$C: It's not, now if thousands shown same or there's only one then it is.
$C: Kind of? Hahah.
$C: I don't think it is as bad as this seems.

The people/demographic that watch these local networks are older folk, baby boomers and the like.  While it is true that the older folks make up the core of the voter blocks and it is extremely worrying for the next few election cycles, that demographic is dying out and the generations after them just don't watch this type of media as much. 

New Media is growing massively but the same thoughts and fears regarding influence will still exist and be a threat.

Just be vigilant and always think critically of the news you watch no matter how you get it.
$C: “Nothing to see here”

We are Sinclair Broadcast Group.  You will be assimilated.  Resistance is futile.
$C: r/stallmanwasright
$C: Which candidate screamed fake news at the top of his lungs? 
$C: Discrediting the media is one of the named stages that a fascist demagogue must use in order to establish an empire.
$C: More like the borg
$C: This is literally what Orwell was warning everyone against.
$C: Or is it Huxleian?
$C: Orwellian is a term for a specific type of control that has to do with how language and information is used to manipulate people's thoughts.

 Props on using this word correctly and not as a synonym for totalitarianism.
$C: >~~Kind of~~ EXTREMELY Orwellian

FTFY...


$C: I wonder (((who))) owns these stations and pushes the urgent concern for dying (((democracy))).
$C: It's a PR statement from corporate..of course they're all going to be the same. This is really obvious and not bad at all. Now if you want disturbing go watch the John Oliver segment where he actually shows them doing this to news reports. 

$C: Recently, a regulation that prevented companies from owning both newspapers and local tv stations was rolled back. This is the result. 
$C: If people didn't care about name brands then Luxottica wouldn't have a leg to stand on. It's our desire for "fashion brands" and name recognition that give them their power to charge whatever we'll pay.
$C: It's specifically local news stations which have been purchased by the [Sinclair Broadcast Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_Broadcast_Group).


And hell, if you think *that* was disturbing, then you're in for a bad time. Because it gets [a whole lot worse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_Broadcast_Group#Political_views) than what you just saw.

>In November 2010, it was reported that five Fox affiliates and one ABC affiliate owned by Sinclair broadcast an infomercial critical of then-President Barack Obama, Breaking Point: 25 Minutes that will Change America, which was sponsored by the National Republican Trust Political Action Group.[174] The infomercial painted Obama as an extremist, and claimed that, during the 2008 presidential campaign, he received some campaign money from the Hamas terrorist group, and that Obama said in a speech, "You want freedom? You’re gonna have to kill some crackers! You gonna have to kill some of those babies." The special also discusses Obama advisers Van Jones and John Holdren, as well as Obama staff Anita Dunn, Kevin Jennings, Carol Browner and Cass Sunstein – all in an unflattering light; in one case, the special claimed that Holdren said that trees should be permitted to sue humans in court. The infomercial aired at various times during the weekend of October 30, 2010 on Sinclair-owned stations in Madison, Cape Girardeau, Lexington, Pittsburgh, Des Moines, and Winston-Salem – all in swing states vital to the 2010 elections.[175][176]
$C: Wow I knew about Luxottica and their sunglasses but had no idea they ow  lenscrafters AND pearl vision.  Man fucking lenscrafters fucked my prescription up good a few years back, did nothing when I complained about it, and I will never go back.  That place is awful. 
$C: I searched mine to see if luxotica owned them and was pleasantly surprised they are independently owned. SPY
$C: "This is extremely dangerous to our monopoly."
$C: As a local TV news journalist, this is terrifying.
$C: >Shane Co your friend in the diamond business

Localizing their ads. 
$C: Almost all diamonds are owned by the same company. De Beers. 
$C: God this is such a tired old comment, luxotica can charge so much because people are willing to pay that much for their products. There is always the cheaper service station alternative but people prefer the brand image that comes along with buying expensive sunglasses
$C: Yeah, and it's not just local fox stations too. NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox were all present in the video. 
$C: It's already been obvious.  I think it's ~~Jimmy Kimmel's~~ Conan's show that always has segments where they play 20 different news stations all telling the same exact scripted joke about the same event.  

Edit: It's Conan!

$C: so many fox news sources
$C: It's like there's people inside your head!
$C: American Idiot sadly gets more relevant over time.
$C: It goes pretty fucking deep, too. Shit is beyond creepy.

>Last April, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai, led the charge for his agency to approve rules allowing television broadcasters to greatly increase the number of stations they own. A few weeks later, Sinclair Broadcasting announced a blockbuster $3.9 billion deal to buy Tribune Media — a deal those new rules made possible.

$C: Are you saying internet news or radio news is better?
$C: All news will soon die. Not because they are 'bad', but because we are moving fast into an era where trust is lost. 
$C: Most local news is fine and serves the public interest.  

It's just Sinclair that's cancer.
$C: > TV news needs to die... quickly.

No, television and radio need to be reborn with changed rules about ownership. No one should be able to own more than a handful of stations, and a very limited number in each market. 

I remember there were rules like that when I was young, but apparently they've been thrown out so billionaires can make more billions.
$C: No, I think Sinclair broadcasting needs to stop sympathizing with Nazis
$C: No not TV news, just Sinclair media who are basically friends with Ajit Pai, and also the repeal where one company can own more than 40% of all local news stations of any given area needs to happen.
$C: Cable news is questionable. 

Local news has been quite reliable and credible outside of Sinclair. 

NO other outlet operates the way that Sinclair is doing - and stations where Sinclair has moved in/bought out find that there are reporters/anchors who will walk. (See WBMA in Birmingham for an example.) 

Local TV news is fine - unless it's a Sinclair station. 
$C: I agree! The public doesn't need to see news. Everyone has a TV and watches TV and if they watch news and find out what's going on, that's bad. The last thing we want is people who vote being informed. Heaven forbid the masses become informed and be up to date on what is happening in the world and in their community. 
$C: Only in America where you don't have laws prohibiting them from sensationalism. Or maybe a better solution is to put in place laws that mean news stations aren't allowed to lie.
$C: The internet isn't all that much better.
$C: American TV
$C: Seriously. TV news has been the misinformation arm of the government and private interest for so long. I wonder how much negative it's done with it's influence of the public. I think news is the reason that despite being safer than ever before, we trust each other less than ever before. I talk to my neighbors if I see them, but mostly we mind our business. I live in an upper middle class neighborhood outside Manhattan. Nobody has any reason to distrust their neighbors here--but we do anyway. I hold sensationalist TV news at least partially responsible. 
$C: Mass-ownership of TV news by singular corporate interests needs to die.
$C: The same company(sinclair) did a multi-billion dollar deal with trump's fcc chair to ensure the death of net neutrality. They are going to make the internet in to a right wing propaganda fever dream.
$C: That would be extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: [I don't watch it.](https://i.imgur.com/cMfkFGP.gifv)


$C: The internet is much scarier.  Every person can now live in their own  personalized dystopian news+(mis)information+propaganda bubble.  The Google's, Facebook's, Twitter's, Reddit's, etc. of the world can manipulate the population in ways TV could only dream of.
$C: It will as the last generation dies out... takes time.
$C: Yes we should all get our news from reddit. Reddit is a rational and intelligent source of news and discussion
$C: Omg you giez this racist classist altrighter says newsworkers need to die! How untolerant! Seriously though, this country needs to come together on at least one thing. Most amazingly it's seeming like it'll be controlled news
$C: Thank god young people dont watch tv news
$C: UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON

For Christ sake, it isn't *TV news* that's the issue. You're already siding with these fucks by taking that position.

It's the skin-changing multi-national corporation Sinclair Broadcasting that needs to die quickly. If you can't tell the difference between the two--if you're one of those "media is bad" people--just shut it down for a while while you figure out what is really going on. Otherwise you're just an unwitting patsy being played by the same people you think you're working against.
$C: Seconded. Read all of Noam Chomsky's stuff. Very insightful and shows the deep rooted nature of these problems.
$C: The only thing to be done is to vote for politicians who will push for new, Anti-Trust (i.e. anti-monopoly) legislation. The midterms are coming up this November. Make sure to register to vote in your area, in many places it can be done online. 
$C: >You haven't seen anything yet.

-Sinclair, probably. 
$C: This. Post it, call them out. Educate the masses. Reduce their reach, increase free speech. 
$C: It's not just Fox, the video includes CBS and ABC, and I think NBC, too.
$C: As a Democrat i call absolute bullshit and it scares me that people actually feel that way. I hope this is satire or something about getting so invested in your own echo chamber you only think it's the other side
$C: This might be the most retarded comment in this entire comment section.
$C: What are you even talking about?
$C: [deleted]
$C: It’s definitely multifaceted to cater to wide groups. It’s not one-sided or two-sided. Placing binary significance on it is dangerous because then we’re just buying the lie. Many ‘liberal’ postmodernist groups are shutting down all avenues of open conversation about issues just as much as far right groups. When we lack communication among groups, society suffers. This is true in global historical context.
The bottom line is we have to read as many opinions as we can and cease solely buying into what one single channel/person tells us to believe.
$C: It needs to be said in the open, this is liberals. This isn't a both sides issue. This isn't democrats and republicans both. It's liberals. They're the ones creating their echo chambers and creating propaganda.
$C: Lol yea because both sides definitely don’t use the same tactics.......
$C: I don't know how, but you've managed to be both right, and completely wrong, at the same time. 
$C: You think this only happens here?  Oh my sweet summer child.
$C: And is this an issue on both sides?
$C: We need RATM more than ever now!! 
$C: He was so goddamn right that it hurts.
$C: I wanted them to play at the DNC again this past election so fucking bad..
$C: RATM was so fuckin good and, although their message was totally relevant in the 90s, it seems even more important today.  If only music today had an ounce of the heart or talent that it did in the 90s.

$C: *abrupt end*
$C: I'm starting to think the experiment is broken. We lost our country in the Wilson administration. I know that must sound absoluely insane, but the moment the government started using psychology based propaganda to promote consumerism, America has been chasing a carrot on a stick and "self determination" became determined for us by convincing people that they should appeal to their *wants* in making purchasing decisions instead of their reason.

EDIT: a word.
$C: They brought it back but it looks like they’re slowly pushing it down/away again. It should be the first post and stay there for awhile with the amount of upvotes it has and all the times it’s been gilded.
$C: I had noticed the title earlier and planned to go back. Couldn't find it on my front page just now and had to come to /r/videos to see it. Interesting.
$C: If incase this gets teken down lets do what Reddit does best. Repost!!! 
$C: But Sinclair has been accused of putting out pro Trump propaganda, isn't most of reddit's posts on the liberal side of things? Genuinely asking, how does it interfere with reddit's narrative? 
$C: Reddit is one of the most censored websites on the internet, but I don't see why or how this is against Reddit..
$C: Yea wtf! Its number 1 on videos, nowhere to be seen on the all list.. 
$C: [removed]
$C: Our awareness of it is extremely dangerous to the oligarchy.

Edit: sometimes I genuinely hate redditors. Y'all are some snooty, self-righteous pricks sometimes. I'm not, nor have I ever been, a republican but if this is how you guys attack someone you *perceive* as being republican, I honestly don't blame some of them at all for saying "fuck it, burn it all down and start again." I have close loved ones that proudly voted for Trump because they really thought *anything* else was better than the status quo. Their opinion was that the US was fucked. It fucking is. But they tried. Just like us lefts or left-leaning. We tried to beat the system even with OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE that no 3rd party candidate can win. 

So they were tricked. Ok. They (most of them) get it. Belittling and chastising is not how you teach. It only causes them to double down in defense when they don't feel they're welcome to switch sides. We were straight up cheated by the DNC but there ain't much stink about that anymore, is there? We really need to work on our fucking welcome wagon. Sweep our own damn porch before we claim to be the party of acceptance.

Get the hell out of my messages. I'm done with Reddit for the day.
$C: The greater good.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to *our* democracy.
$C: Your new empire?!?
$C: [deleted]
$C: Does your new Empire have sand?
$C: No, I'd say the scary part is the imminent broadcasting monopoly dictating a partisan editorial to local news stations word-by-word.

Making a joke out of it is a suitable response. People made fun of Hitler even when he was alive, that didn't detract from the war effort against Nazism.

After all, this very video is meant in part to be humorous, through the way it's edited together. And that only helps drive the point in harder.
$C: He's just a scapegoat. The real guilty party here is the GOP and the radical/manipulable conservatives who would scream their asses off if a "Librul" group bought more than 20% of the media but are totally okay with their side owning 70%
$C: I hope that asshole enjoys his thirty pieces of silver. 
$C: Same thing will happen to the internet after net neutrality regulation was removed :-(
$C: All in the pursuit of making the average person easier to control.
$C: I really hope someone kills that fuck.
$C: True, but there’s good reason not to let it go too far. That’s why the regulation existed.
$C: It happened with radio and then unhappened and things didn't exactly improve since they ended up undoing that even and then all of the small stations were ripe for consolidation.
$C: jfc it’s all so disturbing.
$C: This comment didn't age well. 

It is now #1 on YT Trending. 
$C: I’m going to pay attention, keep score, and vote accordingly
$C: Of course presenting scripts and talking points to overwhelmed news departments isn’t new, but the outright ownership is concerning.

“Use this if you want” becomes “use this or you’re fired”
$C: A lot of the must run anchor leads that make it to air are changed by producers, at least at my station. And if a regional news director hears one of the must runs didn’t air (we drop them first in breaking situations) we get audited. Seriously. Producers go through and give exact times they run to prove they’re actually being shown. It’s fucked. 
$C: Comes down in an email with a list of must runs. This particular “trust promo” is pretty similar to this [“PSA”](https://youtu.be/O2smMAQhihA) we ran last year with VP of news Scott Livingston. 
$C: Been trying to get out. 

Luckily for most reporters/photogs/sports they don’t have to deal with this stuff. But yeah, SBG is so cheap too. It’d have a reputation in the business for being as frugal as it is if they didn’t push a far-right agenda. 
$C: It’s that, or our job. If only it were that easy. 
$C: Corporate deal. Just like how you see any other news station in a certain brand of coat I would imagine. We’ve been getting Ford Escapes when replacing fleet vehicles lately. 

I would imagine they were in a credits copyright at one point in time when the deal was made, just like how you see “wardrobe provided by X” on more national broadcasts. 
$C: Indeed. The mod system is fine and all direct small subs, but for the top 50 or so subs it isn't up to par.
$C: Whoever this post-removing, message-deleting, user-muting moderator is, is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: [removed]
$C: It’s more a general stance against every political videos. It’s shitty in a certain way, but it’s constant and across the whole spectrum. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Idk, looks like it just was made way harder to find.
$C: Well it was extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: America? Put out propaganda? The frogs are not gay
$C: Doublethink
$C: [Consume!](https://youtu.be/TM8L7bdwVaA)
$C: Not quite. Propaganda is a very broad and general concept.
$C: ELI5 please.

I am a Canadian and feel a bit out of it.
Are they referring to the same fake news trump refers to or the fake news trump creates?
$C: Noooo noooo comrade, this not propaganda, some confusion. 
$C: Ya that's why I only trust CNN propaganda xD
$C: Not necessarily. It's how doublethink works. Propaganda doesn't necessarily have to be good or bad. When I see a pro-Bass Pro Shop ad saying they have the best fishing gear prices in town it's neither good, bad, or unfactual. It's still propoganda however
$C: Neo Nazis propaganda
$C: at least on baby boomers and uneducated folks. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: [deleted]
$C: Those are atleast several layers of irony my dude.
$C: Have you ever heard the tragedy of Darth Media the Wise?
$C: From my point of view it is democracy that is evil.
$C: You should do an AMA!
$C: this is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: Going through the comments, this same comment is repeated over thrice now. Its like watching the video in text form.
$C: CBS and ABC is right wing? Since when?
$C: It's the top play in EVERYBODY'S playbook. Don't make this a partisan thing, you're just feeding into the bullshit.
$C: >right wing playbook

lol
$C: if you think this is a partisan issue, then they already got you.
$C: The left do it as well you idiot 
$C: Yes, because the people of right wing are to blame for this... Defiantly not the large corporations blatantly pushing propaganda 
$C: You’re falling for the us vs. them trap.  No one side has moral ground. 
$C: Left wing playbook.  The book is literally called "Rules for Radicals."

Please step away from the propaganda and get some fresh air.
$C: BS. The left invented this and have used it successfully for decades.  It's all in the book Rules for Radicals by Saul Alinsky
$C: That's actually one of Saul Alinsky's tips in his leftist handbook Rules for Radicals. 
$C: Yes .. the left wing politicians and news stations don't do that as well :>) They would NEVER lie to us!
$C: G - Gaslight

O - Obstruct

P - Project <-----
$C: Kind of like the left calling everyone they disagree with a Nazi while at the same time calling for bans on speech, defense, association .....

I understand exactly what you are saying buddy ....
$C: >[It's the top play in the right wing playbook: accuse the other side of the underhanded shit that you're doing.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Randolph_Hearst)
$C: Lmao, that is exactly the reverse of reality. 
$C: yeah its both sides
$C: You think only one side does this?
$C: Lol funny thing is this is what the right accuses the left of doing. So you saying that is actually hilariously apt
$C: This video represents neither left, nor right wing. It simply shows that the powers that be don't care about left and right wing. Only money and control. This isn't partisan, it's Orwellian. There is a unipaty ruling the world, haves, which are very few, and have nots; the many. 
$C: G aslight

O bstruct

**P roject <--This one**
$C: I refuse to believe that the irony of your comment is lost on you. That had to be the point you were trying to make, right?
$C: Yeah this isn't a right wing left wing issue. Youve been brainwashed
 This is a money/greed has taken over our democracy issue. It transcends political leanings.
$C: Both sides there pal
$C: And how is CNN, for example, different? Don't make the mistake of thinking "right wing" are bad and their opponents are good. Both just represent different groups of US oligarchs and their pet industries, and both will and do employ the exact same bias-reinforcing tactics, just in different ways.

This applies on the international scale as well. As a Russian living in the US it's both hilarious and infuriating to watch both sides of US media accusing Russian news outlets of employing the same propaganda tactics that US media uses, but pretending that Russia is the original source of these tactics. It's hilarious to me because much of Russian media just copies western formats with a lag time of a year or two - right down to the diction, and then get criticized by the same western outlets who were copied in the first place. It's infuriating because even though US media "exposes" these propaganda tactics to their audience, with examples of other countries doing it, the same audience is too lazy or too ignorant to notice how US media is literally doing exactly the same thing.
$C: This is local news, and if you think the propaganda comes from one side only, you've been propagandized.
$C: What does right-wing have anything to do with the internet making local news television a relic of a bygone era, thus resulting in less advertising money, and resorting to cost-saving mechanisms like cutting personnel and reading off network scripts?

Nearly all local affiliates are like this now.  I worked at a local affiliate 15 years ago, and the “news” was being assembled by a college aged kid downloading clips and scripts from the network.  And it wasn’t Sinclair.
$C: You think of this as right-wing?  TV news media is almost exclusively left-wing authoritarian.  The "liberalness" gives it a friendly face so they can sneak the authoritarian part past you.
$C: This would be 100% true if 95% of the media wasn't left leaning. But we all know that leftists control the media & they put out this message of fake news being propagated everywhere, but the reality is that they control the airwaves.
$C: Looks you've been had already, dumbass. It's not about a political party. If you think this is just the "right" doing this then they already got you. 
$C: Both sides do that mate
$C: That's at least fox, cbs and abc.    You're an idiot if you think those are all right wing.
$C: Isn't that what you're doing right now?
$C: >Edit: Looks like I hit a **few keywords**
$C: In this respect both Republicans and Democrats are right wing. 

Bill Clinton deregulating the media with the Telecommunications Act in 1996 allowed these kinds of monopolies to come about.

Both parties are backed by large corporations and backed by media conglomerates. 

Two cheeks of the same ass for the most part.

Edit: corrected the name of the act signed by Clinton 
$C: They all do it
$C: Exactly- the gays are recruiting! Wait - ya mean just like Christian groups?
$C: Left wing.
$C: Oh please, if this was MSNBC networks, everyone in the comments would be cheering. Both sides already agree fake news exists and is a major problem right now. Trump just popularized the catch phrase.
$C: Its not conservatives who own these stations
$C: The media is clearly controlled by the left.   Stop watching MSNBC.  
$C: I don't think you can claim one party does it while the other doesn't. Everyone projects, there are examples on both sides of it happening. You're spreading fake news, and that's extremely important in protecting our democracy. 
$C: Same can be said for the end, this video and the ideas behind showing it this way are non partisan. They both do it.
$C: Are you implying that you believe most of them don't believe fabricated news reports to sway public opinion is a danger to our democracy?

Just because it's scripted doesn't mean the message is wrong
$C: 1: Accuse the other side of doing exactly what you are doing. Confusing the fuck out everyone.

2: Profit


That’s why “They have a point though”.

They *are* the point. They are not saying anything new. This is just blatant proof that 1 guy sent a memo and everyone repeats it word for word.

Now I’d reallly like to see someone come up with the same thing from other news outlets claimed to be fake news by these idiots. Then we’d know it’s just all a big steaming pile of shit.

If they can’t - it really proves this current administration is definitely fucking with people’s heads, which most of us already believe and waiting to be proven wrong of course. (If you are wondering why I used administration here see Ajit Pai and Sinclair in the same search)

Can’t wait to see what happens. As usual I hope I am wrong!


$C: That started LONG before Trump and Russia.  Karl Rove was doing it for George W. Bush back when he was Governor of Texas. And many others before him.

Fun fact:  Rove is also the most recent person to use the push polling technique so well.  In South Carolina in 2000, Rove authored a poll that asked voters of John McCain, "Would you be more or less likely to vote for John McCain…if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child?"  It wasn't true, but it put the idea out there, en masse, and by most accounts, cost McCain the GOP nomination.
$C: You have forgotten that this current world order, especially in media, is and was established well and long before Trump ever stepped into it. Think what you want about him, this isn't his brainchild. 
$C: \>propaganda didn't exist until 2016

$C: Uhhhh, you've got that quite backwards lol. He is a flaming liberal and has been his entire life. Ask him, he will probably respond.
$C: What have you been smoking?
$C: Alright. I'll be the one to do it.

I scrolled through at least 100 comments on my way down here. Almost every single comment is a throwaway one-liner. Now there might have been some top secret meeting where we all established the subtext of all our one-liners *before* this post, but I was in the john so I missed it.

Why is this video so scary?

Did we expect John the local weatherman to share his personal thoughts on "fake news"?

I mean, the idea that Sinclair owns so many stations is its own problem, but what about this video is so poignant? Why is *this* video so scary that it reduced thousands of Redditors to speaking in vague one-liners?

I mean the video cuts off the rest of the script:

>"Hi, I'm(A) ____________, and I'm (B) _________________...

> (B) Our greatest responsibility is to serve our Northwest communities. We are extremely proud of the quality, balanced journalism that KOMO News produces.

> (A) But we're concerned about the troubling trend of irresponsible, one sided news stories plaguing our country. The sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media.

> (B) More alarming, some media outlets publish these same fake stories... stories that just aren't true, without checking facts first.

> (A) Unfortunately, some members of the media use their platforms to push their own personal bias and agenda to control 'exactly what people think'...This is extremely dangerous to a democracy.

> (B) At KOMO it's our responsibility to pursue and report the truth. We understand Truth is neither politically 'left nor right.' Our commitment to factual reporting is the foundation of our credibility, now more than ever.

> (A) But we are human and sometimes our reporting might fall short. If you believe our coverage is unfair please reach out to us by going to KOMOnews.com and clicking on CONTENT CONCERNS. We value your comments. We will respond back to you.

> (B) We work very hard to seek the truth and strive to be fair, balanced and factual... We consider it our honor, our privilege to responsibly deliver the news every day.

> (A) Thank you for watching and we appreciate your feedback"

What is sinister about this message? They're literally saying "we're giving you a forum to share your comments on our biases". Did you expect every news station in a company to come up with their own version of a message like this? This is as corporate level a message as you get. They're not pretending it's a new story, they're not trying to hide the message in a broadcast, it's literally sitting down with the viewer and saying "We know fake news is a thing, we know we screw up sometimes, here's how you can help us fix it"


The irony is too real, the video above cut out the part of the script that makes the entire message whole, and edited it in a way that made it sound completely different than it does in its entirety. You can probably guess if the creator was biased towards or against Sinclair. 

But here are thousands of Redditors lapping it up. I just don't get Reddit sometimes.


$C: They're not actors, they all started at regular reporters. No one goes into a news station with a degree in theater and gets a job as an anchor.
$C: People love to put down internet "influencers", but they have the camera three feet from their face and live in constant terror of being abandoned by a hypercritical audience the moment they compromise their precious sincerity in any way. Most of them are just sincerely terrible people, but that's a start.
$C: There are absolutely real journalists with integrity out there, but sadly they are indeed in short supply. Nonprofit media is where it's at.
$C: They should be shamed. Unfortunately movies like anchorman have promoted and normalized their kind of morality that sleezball charisma is more important than trustworthiness for that professional carreer ladder. 
$C: The are more anchors than you think who write the material that is written on their teleprompter. They don't just come in before the broadcast starts, film, and leave. They're in the office all day working on the stories being discussed that day.
$C: I've met more news anchors than most people and one thing I've come to learn is that they're all morons who's only talent is reading a teleprompter. Try to have a conversation with them without one and they look like pretty, sophisticated, very poorly built chat bots. 
$C: I put 0 trust in news anchors, i come to Reddit for my news, then read the comments for a better understanding of the story
$C: > They're people who would have gotten into TV and movies if they were more talented and/or better looking.


Well I coulda been an actor, but I wound up here. I don't have to look good I just have to be clear.

$C: It depends on the organization. National news anchors usually take journalism seriously and have a great deal of involvement in assembling the day's news report. So do a lot of mainstream local anchors. Some less journalistic organizations use anchors as figureheads for other people's scripts. Sinclair is sending read this or else notices to all the channels they own, so even if their anchors normally write their own material, Sinclair is overriding them in this case.

The problem is that a normal viewer has no way of knowing what kind of newscast it is. You have to follow them behind the scenes or watch them long enough to get a feel for the anchor's capabilities. It's easy to dress up some actors as newscasters and give them a script. It's slightly harder but way more effective to give a propaganda artist their own platform and force your stations to run it as news. The words they speak will be loaded with lies and manipulation, but on the surface, it's another well-dressed TV personality speaking in a calm, authoritative tone.

Forcing formerly independent anchors to read scripts blurs the line further, destroying trust in them and lending some of their credibility to the propaganda segments. And once again, the unsuspecting casual viewer might never notice the shift from independence to script.

One idea I floated on Reddit a few times after the 2016 election was to have a trademarked association of serious news teams that could invite or expel members based on how well they follow common standards. It wouldn't do anything to stop an operation like Sinclair from spreading, but it would provide a visible mark of approval for members who continue to produce their own responsible reporting. If a new owner turns the newsroom into puppets, the mark of approval would be taken away. It would give ordinary viewers an easy way to tell whether an outlet was part of the wider journalistic community or disguising propaganda as a news broadcast.
$C: I think you’re thinking of national news/top 5 market anchors here. Local news anchors at most TV stations are required to have at least a bachelors degree in journalism and 5 years of experience reporting.

As far as local anchors not being an expert on anything—you’re absolutely right. As local TV journalists, it’s literally their job to be a jack of all trades. One moment they’re reporting on a fire and the next they’re reporting on city council raising property taxes and the next moment they’re doing an investigation about superfund sites dumping chemicals, which seep into residents’ water.  

Most local TV news anchors write their own scripts. Decades ago, TV stations had the resources where the news anchor could walk in at 4:45 and be ready to sit down and read the 5 o’clock show. Now, they do not. Nowadays, besides the producer, they’re writing the most scripts for air. And local TV news anchors are still expected to turn longer news reports like a reporter.


$C: These people are LOCAL news anchors. Statistically speaking, they're MORE trusted than MSM anchors because they're just local joe shmoes, which is why this is a huge problem. Sinclair forces these local stations to include these in their broadcasts and therefore inserting right-wing conspiracy bullshit into the homes of unsuspecting moms and pops everywhere. 
$C: He still wants to be a cool guy libertarian.
$C: muh free market 
$C: It would be nice if this kind of heavy-handed government interference in the process wouldn't be necessary, and that the free market would take care of it to maintain diversity in the journalistic realm.

Clearly not.  Law them up.
$C: I want to know now too.
$C: I thought this was a strange phrase to use as well.
$C: Because it's depressing and extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: LITERALLY was going to say exactly this. i love to say, but i dont believe it will ever happen realistically. 
$C: > These people will literally read whatever is on the teleprompter, and it's the same script.

This is one of the silliest things I've ever read. Does that guy think news anchors personally investigate the news and we catch them just as they return to the studio in their fucking batmobile?
$C: I do wonder how many of these anchors will see this video and have a "holy shit, this is fucked" mind-blowing, eye-opening moment versus "enh, that's how it is" apathy.
$C: The UK takes a different approach with broadcast media whereby injecting opinion is forbidden - reporting has to be factual and neutral. Unfortunately the rest of the system is pretty badly structured with regards to ownership and and doesn't apply to print/online media.
$C: Next day. Still remember.
$C: Remember everyone, it's only your enemies that do this. Your "side", whichever that may be, is virtuous and right and would *never* do such a thing like the things your enemies are doing. Perish the thought!
$C: ~~You couldnt have just made the whole word a link instead just the period could you 😆~~ never mind i wish I hadn't clicked that, now it's in my brain 
$C: Wow - so it was a stolen video. That isn't Deadspin's channel. This should be reposted using that official link.
$C: I was merely trying to thank OP for posting it, or else I wouldn't have seen it 
$C: It's not adorable that you have to be a condescending dick to people 
$C: Could be they were complimenting a decent find, too.
$C: Someone takes Reddit too seriously.
$C: Most people don't realize Sinclair Broadcasting is the OP of this bullshit
$C: I actually think that it is. The Reddit account is a small unknown account that regularly posts videos from a small unknown active youtube channel.
$C: And media consolidation legalized in 1996 by Bill Clinton. 
$C: Guess who was president
$C: Reddit: "And this is in fact Trump's fault because...."
$C: Extremely 
$C: The Nazis were happily voted into power.
$C: Control. Power. 
$C: Some questions: Have you read George Orwell's 1984? Are you familiar with something called state run media? Control what is reported as "fact" then control what the masses believe is truth... and go from there.

$C: The only upside of social media among that (very potent) downside is that you can at least be presented with the opposing view and find different information. If your only source is a talking head on TV, or the same newspaper delivered to your door each morning, you'll just never know any of it.
$C: >  On social media, there are no gatekeepers

are you literally retarded?
the gatekeepers of social media are the corporations behind said social media, look at youtube changing policy on guns channel last week.

$C: It's sad because the only way people I know will actually watch this is if I shove it in their damn faces. Being a vocal Bernie supporter on Facebook has killed the effectiveness of sharing anything on that platform for me.
$C: I didn't grasp that this was local news but that makes more sense. This is fucked
$C: I'm confused as to how there are Fox, NBC and ABC all under the same message. Can you explain how that works?
$C: And they've got a free pass from Pai's FCC to continue buying up more stations.
$C: [deleted]
$C: All MSM is bad. Left and Right. CNN is just as bad
$C: Local affiliate television no longer bring in the advertising money thanks to the internet, thus in order to prevent the stations from shutting down, people were laid off, and scripts are provided to the on-air talent to reduce manpower.

The manpower and financial resources necessary for all of the local affiliate stations to run totally original programming would bankrupt these companies.  

It sucks...  but it’s a dying industry.  Your choices are to either have no local news, or a shitty, diluted local news.
$C: They’re probably owned by Putin, or the Mercers.
$C: Lololololol 
$C: Not the mama!
$C: Lol anytime I see a linked thread that turns out to be /r/politics everything gets disregarded 
$C: If you’re not with me...then you’re my enemy.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our demo ... ALL GLORY TO HYPNOTOAD
$C: Technically a collective consciousness  is a perfect democracy.
$C: And it's name is Sinclair.

HELLO SINCLAIR, HOW MAY WE WHITE YOU
$C: The Federation aren't sending their best. They're sending androids, they're sending bald Frenchmen, and some - I assume - are good people. 
$C: and surrender your ships...
$C: You will adapt to service us 
$C: It's extremely dangerous to our democracy 
$C: South Park called it
$C: it's all we can do to stay alive in a capitalist world

do YOU want to stay alive? Why not try one of these wonderful products?

ヽ(' ▽' )ノ !
$C: South Park really is ahead of time. 
$C: How can our humans be real if our ads aren't real
$C: Im familiar with the Seinfeld episode, What’s the connection here?
$C: Why would *Jerry* bring anything?
$C: these pretzels...........ARE MAKING ME THIRSTY!
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy?
$C: When did Motley Crue become classic rock?

Edit: please make this...stop, stop, STOP
$C: Woohoo hoooo
$C: Great Scott! Marty!
$C: Then tell me, future boy, who's President of the United States in 1985?
$C: There was U2, and Blondie, her musics still on MTV..... 
$C: Well, I'm partying like it's 1999, so catch up.  
$C: Alright, time to go buy some plutonium at the corner drugstore!
$C: https://youtu.be/K38xNqZvBJI?t=1m6s
$C: According to Passion Pit, 1985 was a good year
$C: 2ueh 2221st photo 1
$C: I hear Brave New World is nice
$C: To the reader wanting to read something else than 1984: If you liked 1984; try Fahrenheit 451, Animal farm, or A Brave New World.
$C: I rather enjoyed Harry Potter myself.
$C: Everyone here is either still in high school or hasn’t read a book since being forced to in 10th grade. 

That said this is some creepy shit. 
$C: You think people who make those types of comments have actually read it?
$C: Fahrenheit 451 is pretty good, the audio book is also read by Tim Robbins (notably from Shawshank Redemption).
$C: I mean, it's pretty relevant here
$C: Everytime someone mentions this book there is someone like you saying almost the exact same thing. It's the "I only liked their first album" of book criticism. We get it, you liked the book before it became mainstream.
$C: See the ministry of truth. Sinclair works directly with the RNC. Gorka has op ed pieces stations are forced to air with pro Trump propaganda. 
$C: I hate when people compare today to 1984. Its no where close, not in the US or any modern country. 1984 is a crazy world with mandatory 'telescreens' installed in every house and you can get arrested/killed for even questioning events or acting too 'out'.

The closest I'd say is *maybe* full blown North Korea, and even then...
$C: The book 1984
$C: The main slogan of the dystopian INGSOC government in the novel 1984 is:

>War is Peace

>Freedom is Slavery

>Ignorance is Strength

One of the primary themes of the novel is that, by controlling the information (and the message, and eventually even the language) you can control the people, no matter what the truth *actually* is.

To add to this, the Ministry of Truth is the name of the Ministry of propaganda within the novel.

This is why everyone is focusing on the "this is extremely dangerous to our democracy" line. It is the kind of thing that sounds like it would come out of the Ministry of "Truth" in 1984.
$C: Money needs a hug. 
$C: That doesn't sound like the most transparent administration in history.
$C: Wouldn’t a video like this reinforce trumps view that the mass media is for the most part bullshit? 
$C: This is why Obama was the most unfairly treated president ever.

He upheld so many of conservative policies that sends liberals convulsing, yet conservatives hate him for being a 'socialist'.

Progressives hate Obama for his centrist colors, yet forget to think about the fact he had to deal with the people mentioned above squatting in congress for 95% of his presidency. 

He got one shot and he used it to give out healthcare to trump states. Look how they paid him back.
$C: > He has declared the press an “enemy of the American people”  
  
\*looks at video\*  
\*looks at quote\*  
\*looks at video\*


$C: Wouldn't Trump's distrust and rhetoric against the MSM be proof that he is actually helping improve freedom of the press?  The video that sparked this discussion is how the MSM is owned by globalist elitists who control what you hear and say on the MSM.
$C: > Their main issues seem to be with Trump's rhetoric against the MSM

Given this video, mightn't he be at least a little bit correct about the MSM?
$C: Your quote disagrees with your assessment. Their interest is in Freedom of the press. They lost two examples, which use a lot of sentences. But it’s not those two examples that they care about, but the system which inhibits freedom of the press. 
$C: It isn't just rhetoric when it is actually true, the video here even backs it up.  You may not like Trump, but you may also not be as intelligent as you think you are.
$C: The ranking was just as low when Obama was President. 
$C: The fuck, for years I've literally believed the r/politics narrative that the O administration was the most transparent. Guess that's another blow to my beliefs
$C: > Media freedom in Japan has been declining ever since Shinzo Abe became Prime Minister again in 2012. What with controversial dismissals and resignations, growing self-censorship within the leading media groups and a system of “kisha clubs” (reporters’ clubs) that discriminate against freelancers and foreign reporters, journalists have difficulty serving the public interest and fulfilling their role as democracy’s watchdogs. Many journalists, both local and foreign, are harassed by government officials, who do not hide their hostility towards the media. Members of nationalist groups on social media also intimidate and harass journalists who dare to question the government or tackle “controversial” subjects. Despite UN protests, the government continues to refuse any debate about a law protecting “Specially Designated Secrets,” under which whistleblowers, journalists, and bloggers face up to ten years in prison if convicted of publishing information obtained “illegally.”

$C: Really? Why would you expect them to be any better? lol. 
$C: And with online sources you mean mostly bs somebody said on Facebook. Sure there are some people that use multiple sources and things like that, but let's not pretend it's a significant number. 
$C: Oh look, you fell for the propaganda.
$C: Haven't you heard? The only amendment that counts is the second. 
$C: America, where you're free to turn your dog into a nazi and show straight up NAZI symbolism to other people but GOD FORBID you criticize politicians then you go to prison.
$C: But the UK is ranked 40?
$C: Eh, didn't you guys just recently come out with a huge rape group being silenced by both UK police and media? 40 years it was going on.

From what I hear they wouldn't even give rape victims any air time under the assumption it would be racist.
$C: Must be nice not having any freedom of speech! 
$C: Lol youre joking right?
$C: If that is what "free press" gets you, you clearly need something else. In any case with the us' atrocious press freedom index you can't even call it free. 
$C: So wrong. If you make 60k you are bottom of the middle class. The 1% start at 1.2 million per year. https://www.economist.com/node/21543178
$C: A stolen video... If everything posted to this sub was given this kind of scrutiny, /r/videos wouldn't have any content.
$C: Something tells me the original owner of the video won't care if it's stolen. Rather they probably made it *specifically* to spread and share 
$C: For something this big, can't they just edit the link to the correct person? Or maybe that's what they did?
$C: ...but that doesn't restore it to the front page apparently?

How convenient...
$C: rightwinger mods?
$C: For Christ's sake, I saw this on my phone while I was on the toilet, went back to my desktop to share it and it was gone. The censorship on this site is getting insane.
$C: How did I just find it on /r/all then?
$C: Something tells me [Sinclair Broadcasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_Broadcast_Group) didn't like the message it was sending.
$C: they over act worse than in a porno
$C: For sure. Dangerous though. I gotta think this would not be allowed unless it no longer mattered. Billionaires are not just gonna bow out gracefully.
$C: What are you even talking about
$C: Considering the nature of the vid, it made me very suspicious when it was taken down.
$C: Was the post actually stolen or do we know if OP is the creator of the content?
$C: Some merit to that, but Bernays was a hack and a snake oil salesman who made money selling his propaganda superpowers, so take him with a grain of salt
$C: Perfect.
$C: Reddit has the shadiest mods I swear to God. Not surprising given that a certain community resides here and spez is their number one fan boy.
$C: They don’t ... it’s just css friend 
$C: There are ideas that can be known to a practical certainty and there are ideas that aren’t. There are people that hold objectivity as a value and practice self-critical thinking and those that don’t. That’s as true in politics as science or any other body of thought. 

To the extent that we can know anything at all, there is obtainable objective truth and its value varies across the human spectrum. You might say that’s just proof of individual reflections of their experience, but those reflections are still a function of a coherent, defined, deterministic reality of objective truth.  

If anything it’s really the notion of falsity that is entirely a human construct since truth is defined as a description of what “is.”
$C: A practical objective truth is different from philosophical nihilism.  I think the best approach to nihilism is to realize it does absolutely nothing to help you live your life, and you have to start looking at your subjective goals as subjectively important to you.  Even if you're doing it all for no reason, you're still programmed by desires and feelings that won't just magically disappear when you understand they're actually meaningless.

Nihilism, to me, is simply permission to view yourself and your subjective viewpoint as the be-all end-all of your existence.  It's really nothing more than that, though.
$C: The days of objective media are long gone though, it's almost nonexistant anymore except in some rare examples of small town local news stations. 

>However, by targeting media as even being capable of delivering "objective truth", it fosters a culture where people reinforce their own opinions within their own filter bubble,

Yeah, we've passed this point already. The news has been leaning heavily left or right in most cases for a long time now, and you can't blame either the right or the left. Different stations show different biases, but the difference in that regard is there's a lot of cognitive dissonance when it comes to bias on the left. At least people watching Fox *know* it's not even close to being objective, while [on the other hand....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grtACW6R29s)

I'm just wondering if we've passed the point of no return in the US. Can we recover from the insane political and cultural polarization we're being subjected to every day? Or will it drive us apart until there's finally a collapse of some sort?
$C: i wonder if, instead of the paradigm being truth vs. non-truth, it would be more helpful to think in terms of having integrity vs. lacking integrity when it comes to media sources. no one publication or channel will ever provide The Truth, but some sources have integrity, are credible, ground their reporting in measurable facts and follow those up with sound logical arguments, and some lack integrity, are not credible, do not ground their reporting in measurable facts and jump to baseless or illogical conclusions in their reporting. "does this source have integrity?" is an easier and more practical question to answer than "is this source telling the truth?"
$C: I'd say that most philosophers would believe that there is no objective truth, but rather ideas which are either justified or not to believe in (and in varying degree).  
  
In a way, they're not lying when they're saying there's no ultimate truth, but they're insinuating that everything is automatically wrong because of it which is where the propaganda lies.
$C: Your bringing up filter bubbles reminded me of how Google tailors their search results for different geographical areas. It's also in how we subscribe on social media.

I also don't believe in objective claims to truth but the media has no place for it anyway. Let them have their stories. Let them tell two lies for every "truth".

Resistance betrays everyone in the end.
$C: First thing that comes to mind is forcing parent companies like Sinclair to put their names on all the child companies they own so these channels are easy to identify and associate with a singular entity instead of allowing them to easily pass off as independent and free-thinking, thus making bullshit like this easier to identify for the layman. Only thing is that a lot of voters wouldn't like that because they believe it harms the free market and gives the government the power to "control the media."

Second thing that comes to mind is to just convince people to stop watching these channels so Sinclair loses the viewership they use to fund all these channels, which doesn't seem like it could ever happen.
$C: Develop due process procedures to identify and prosecute those engaging in disinformation and foreign propaganda. 

Not only is that a practical measure but it reaffirms the notion of objective, obtainable truth and the expectation of truth and virtue among information sources, politicians, and the country as a whole. 

It’s the exact opposite of the authoritarian strategy that depends on muddied waters, extreme cynicism, and paralyzed public resolve. 

$C: Become educated and informed - which is the foundation and purpose of news content. 

* Identify any Sinclair stations in your market and boycott them. Boycott any events that they sponsor. If you see local dealerships, businesses, etc advertising on a Sinclair station, contact them directly and respectfully advise them that you will be boycotting them until they pull all advertising dollars from the Sinclair stations.

* If you're going to watch local news, be aware that no other group does what Sinclair does. They're not "all the same." Even local FOX affiliates are different from Fox News Channel. They do not take directives or agendas from the affiliate network. At worst, they'll over-promote entertainment content by covering local tie-ins (like NBC's Olympic coverage and local NBC affiliates creating tie-in stories.) 

* Make people aware of Sinclair and it's agenda. If your parents/friends are supporting Sinclair stations by watching them, let them know what they're supporting. If you walk into a local business that has a Sinclair station on the TV, let them know that you won't return if they continue to show that station in their venue. 
$C: Eat the rich. 
$C: Vote out the republicans. 
$C: Vote on November 6 2018
$C: Do not support authoritarian politicians
$C: Vote democrat.

And primary the ones unwilling to take on the entrenched corporate power and the ones that end up getting bought off after election.

Don't let anyone bullshit you into thinking both sides do this either.
$C: Support a 3rd party
$C: Yeah I have a plain anti-disinformation agenda. My name references it and my post history is full of it. I’m just a guy in Tulsa though. No one pays me to post on reddit and I believe what I say. 

I’m one of many people who are *extremely* bothered by the authoritarian information environment that’s descending on the US and feel an irresistible compulsion to sound the alarm. 
$C: Being "agenda driven" is only bad in certain contexts. Any person sharing a political opinion is technically "agenda driven".
$C: Salon is largely cold-take, editorial garbage. I’m not sure they’re competent enough to be called left-wing propagandists since they benefit the right at least as much as the left. 

Buzzfeed and mother jones have fact based reporting and observable journalistic standards you won’t find in any propaganda outlet. 

They’re not propaganda. 
$C: Buzzfeed is very left leaning, but they are factual. Obviously the lifestyle articles take some liberty, but the actual news articles are factually accurate, even if liberal in leaning. 
$C: So Russia doesn't do any bad things?
$C: Not necessarily. US media is free to print what they want. Unlike Russian media, they don’t have to carry the leader’s talking points if they don’t want to and there’s unlimited examples you could point to on any topic that would show this. 

Almost all of the “anti-Russian news” you’re complaining about is objective reporting based in fact. But like Sinclair is doing now in the US, Putin has spread a message of hypercynicism to the Russian populace that all information sources and politicians are equally deceptive and corrupt. They have been beaten into believing there no possibility US media could possibly report the truth. 
$C: Because the ultimate objective is to instill a feeling of hopelessness and erase expectation for change. The idea is that Putin is seen as undeafatable and any alternative would be the same or worse. This disinformation strategy is called hypernormalization and it’s been written about extensively. 

It’s a part of why whataboutism and other forms of extreme projection are so central to a Russian propaganda messaging. That’s not just a defense to a specific charge but a long term campaign to convince their targets of universal corruption and deceit. 
$C: It's russians all the way down
$C: Only problem is most of the workers disagree with you 
$C: Excellent contribution to the discussion right here
$C: Fox News and other conservative media outlets have talked about liberal media bias incessantly, on the order of several times an hour, for decades. The right is distinct in engaging in this type of truth-obliterating authoritarian propaganda and they’ve done so for decades. Obejective truth exists and there are people who value it. There are also exist liars and the self-deluded. It’s not any harder to tell the difference in politics than in science. 

This conservative trait is longstanding but has only recently accelerated and crystalized under Trump’s full-blown adoption of anti-factualism. 

$C: News flash. All reporting has a bias. That is not even remotely the same thing as literally writing the script for all your controlled media.

$C: Shit that keeps popping up everywhere in this thread by a bunch of different accounts. Hmmmmmmmmm
$C: The same intelligence agencies that were used to con Americans into supporting the Iraq war? 
$C: Is that the same CIA that controlled the messaging in the media with Operation Mockingbird?
$C: Ah, the CIA; bastion of truth in my lifetime.
$C: It wouldn't have been this easy to divide us if there weren't already cracks showing. Some Russian hackers pushing political agendas on the internet wouldn't have done dick if we weren't already a failing society with ridiculous wealth distribution, a shitty live to work culture, overly expensive health care and college, ridiculous incarceration rates and private prison, a draconian war on drugs, etc. We fucking suck. Don't blame Russia for causing this divide--blame the top 1% in America who have been working at this for DECADES.
$C: Fuck the cia, they are one of the worst.
$C: Generally not from a country the US has sanctioned, bargaining to remove those sanctions though.  That's a bit more... treasonous.  
$C: You are naive if you think that its one sided.  
$C: Every country with an ounce of influence meddles in the democratic elections of every other country that they care about.  The US is probably the worst offender about this.

The "Russian thing" is only a thing because people really, *really* did not enjoy the outcome of this particular election.
$C: News is Europe is crazy toxic in a lot of places. Look at Poland. Look at the UK. 
$C: I'm still seeing it fwiw. Hey maybe this could actually promote it.

$C: Integrity, my darling. You must have one in the family. 
$C: Yeah, we get it. You don't need to reply to every single comment with this.
$C: And so quite rightly, they shouldn't be trusted
$C: fox absolutely publishes fake news, it is not among the respectable press.
$C: I mean fox is technically fake news since they are not a news organizations lol
$C: > Bias'd

what
$C: This is true - and even moreso when it applies to local news outlets (regardless of network affiliation.) 

The problem is when ownership groups, like Sinclair, inject the national-bias approach long visible in outlets like MSNBC and Fox News Channel into local reporting. 

It's the same taking a shit in the at-capacity public pool on a hot summer day.
$C: CNN? FoxNews? Hahaha - I'm not from the US, but your post is fake news man...
$C: [deleted]
$C: I think people are having a problem because the statement is trying to discredit other news sources as biased or fake when they are also biased. They're pretending not to be, which is dangerous. Also, they don't make it clear enough which news sources are trustworthy. Social media obviously isn't trustworthy, so it would be okay to inform people to be more careful on the Internet at least, but you could also easily twist their statement to apply to any legitimate news station which you feel is fake because they are biased against your views. That's dangerous because democracy is not about one sidedness, and this statement feels like it's hostile specifically at pro-Left or rather not-right news which someone in particular has been calling "fake" in recent times. There is no clear definition of fake, because people have been using it just to ignore news they disagree with. So, this Sinclair statement is not only hypocritical but poorly executed if not intentionally poorly executed. 
$C: The omission of quotes or conveniently paraphrasing is the popular trick in the book. How bias can you go before the message is completely misconstrued and becomes an untruth (I used the word untruth specifically here) I wanna say is if you don't trust outlets like RT then you shouldn't trust other state sponsored outlets like the BBC. Both are funded by bodies that have agendas.
$C: Yup. A former RT reporter wrote a "must read" script for Sinclair 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Russia didnt do crap compared to progressive liberal fake news
$C: In the UK the BBC says fake news are things like celebrity hoaxes such as  "you wont believe what this celebrity said/looks like now!"

It means they're avoiding drama with competing outlets but it also means them and their collaborators can keep feeding you big stories. They're trying to teach you that fake news is just for small stories, small outlets and gossip, definitely NOT the kind of big stories they cover!
$C: We need to stop this shit where people compare CNN, MSNBC, and Fox. MSNBC is slightly biased, but they are nowhere near what Fox deliberately does with their channel. Not sure how this shit started but it's a huge disservice when you put other major news networks in even the same category as Fox. 
$C: They're all neoliberals supporting the views of the ruling class.
$C: Fox is fair and balanced without a spin?
$C: Thank God you dug through my post history! You almost had to confront what I actually said just for a second there!

Post = Invalidated! 

Oof!
$C: Stop trying to win arguments by being a stalker.
$C: Unfortunately, it doesn't take much for people to revert to tribalism. 
I have seen just as many comments insinuating that their side is less guilty of propagandizing as there are comments criticizing the power of Big Media.
$C: What you are seeing is tribalism. My side is better than your side. 

How much either side actually does it is irrelevant, because the real revelation this video should give is that all media wages a war for your mind, 24/7.
$C: username checks out, this guy gets it
$C: This is a very specific scenario: Sinclair is definitely a conservative news company and will soon cover 72% of US households
$C: Which left-leaning media company issued must-run orders to local TV stations on politically charged segments?

Must have missed it.
$C: All of the networks shown here are pro-trump owned Sinclair Broadcast Group
$C: Because he's a lying sack of fascist shit, bro.
$C: All of the networks shown here are pro-trump owned Sinclair Broadcast Group
$C: As far as I am concerned, same shit.  I consume media directly instead of on someone's owned channel.  Streaming media is popular for a reason.
$C: Larry King doesn't exactly work for RT. He has a TV show he created with and for Mexican telecom company Ora TV, which was originally available only on Hulu and Ora TV. Later, RT picked up broadcast rights as well, so while it's available to watch there, to say Larry King works for them is more than a stretch. Honestly, given the control he has over his own career at this point, to say he "works for" anyone but himself is a stretch. 
$C: Welcome to the club!
$C: Many thanks!
$C: > CNN, FOX, MSNBC, WAPO, NYT, ABC and the list goes on

No it doesn't. Using just this video as evidence, here's your list:

**Sinclair Broadcast Group**

$C: Nope. That is what they want. Distrust of all journalism/media=good for corporate overlords, because there is no answering of the bell for any bullshit they pull
$C: Can’t, not for a year and a half. I signed a contract and would have to pay thousands of dollars to break it. 
$C: Huh I was there for some of those too. Maybe I should pay more attention to stuff lol 
$C: Well this thread should be huge. Even more huge cos if people srsly did not know this shit... Well fuck... 
$C: Oh no, I totally agree! I don’t follow either sides of the spectrum and attempt to avoid all news and social media other than reddit (and occasionally YouTube, but I don’t post on there) because it allows people to still stay somewhat anonymous to other readers  AND it allows everyone to have an unrestricted voice. I literally deleted all social and news media accounts I had and switched solely to reddit/youtube (including Facebook almost a year ago - best one I ever got rid of lol) - I’ve noticed now that news stories break faster on here than any other website anyways! I’m starting to get annoyed with the restrictions on certain content on YouTube though, while other nasty things are allowed to stay on completely undeterred. 
$C: Dont forget the DISTURBING CONTENT tag it had there for awhile. and actually it was locked no less than 3 times. possibly more, didnt get in here until hour 3. Mod wars are nifty
$C: Idk dude, I’m not American so I wouldn’t know. 
$C: Last I checked, HBO wasn't a news station.
$C: I actually have been hearing a lot of shit about Google News lately, but they're the one I trust the least. They tend to lean left a bit.
$C: I mean yeah, they have been calling the media fake news whenever it didn't suit them, but this video in particular is the pot calling the kettle black. Fox News itself broadcasting an anti-fake news message will convince its viewers that it couldn't possibly be fake news. The fact is, sensationalized news comes from nearly every network in this video, ESPECIALLY Fox. The more Fox's viewers buy into this "us vs. them" rhetoric, the more divided we become.

Also, It wasn't at the top of /r/T_D when I looked. My intention wasn't to spread any information, my intention was to inspire even ONE person to go out and vote this year.


$C: The first one does raise questions, but the second one is just a single word being used by different people for several different stories at different times. 'Chaos' is actually a pretty good way to describe the current administration anyway, with his ~50% turnover rate and twitter meltdowns and countless investigations. Kushner can't even look up his own birthday.
$C: Man you really need to take a step back.

Your first link was painted similarly because that was the reality of scenario. Literally no president sworn in spoke in such fear mongering fashion, what do you expect media to report?

Your second link are a bunch of news outlets that used a single, solitary fucking word in every headline that the WH aide themselves used?

How do you not see yourself grasping for straws here?
$C: When I was typing this comment, I didn't even think about any race or religion. The main theme is that *money* corrupts, not faith, race, or any other bullshit.

I think your comment might actually be a little antisemitic itself, since you assumed I was somehow talking about Jews. 

I wasn't.
$C: Ummm sure.. After infinity War though? 
$C: I already don't do Disney. Is there anything else we can boycott?
$C: And this is showing that Sinclair, who owns the local news, also has an agenda.
$C: I thought it would be ironic and funny to guild this comment above so I did.. then I read through his comments t history and realised he's a xenophobic racist and now I feel like a bad person :(
$C: No they are not. Fox News is owned by 21st Century Fox
$C: They may host some fox affiliates, but I'm pretty sure that news corp isn't affiliated with Sinclair.
$C: The Big 4 Networks aren't shutting them down...
$C: I like how you found a way to still blame conservatives for the problems in the media lol
$C: Good call. To play devil’s advocate here, how likely do you think it is that enough people do this to make a difference? My guess is low likelihood, as much as I’d like it to be high
$C: Those are great suggestions, but I'm certainly not optimistic. In my experience, local news devotees aren't the type to take any of those steps.
$C: This is great advice. The problem is no one wants to take the time to actually go to the source. They just read a headline and forward it to their friends. 
$C: It's because top posts fall from the top over time. It was at the top... At 12 AM EST last night. I agree, it's really bad. Also read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/7j5w9f/_/)
$C: [deleted]
$C: I don’t think anyone is surprised by the actual message. This is nothing new, media credibility has been in the talks for a long time.

I think the message that gave everyone the chills is the copypasta. I mentioned somewhere else I wish I could know for sure this isn’t happening with other stations not particularly Sinclair.

Hopefully if the proof is there for other networks somebody will find it, so I guess we wait! 

I’ll go read that thread though thanks
$C: That response is actually chilling.
$C: Sinclair is* creating alt accounts.
$C: Gleichschaltung. Although its meaning is more far reaching than just sychonizing media.
$C: Lol! My lord had nothing to do with this one! The watermark will be at the end of the broadcast that will have the copyright with it too. So hence if everything mentioned on the show is copyrighted by the company, so is this statement. News broadcasters barely get an opportunity to express their own opinion. And as we've seen time and time again, when a broadcaster goes off script and theirs a backlash, their company distances themselves from the broadcaster and their comment quickly. Yet if the scripted message upsets viewers, then the company comes out with a statement and avoids throwing the broadcaster under the bus. 
$C: First I don't know if the creator of the video included all parts or not but going on the assumption that they did  then here is my logic... Are they employed by Sinclair? Yes. Are they reading a statement? Yes. Ergo they are reading a statement from Sinclair. For the most part, unless specified or called out, news reporters are limited to their opinions on air. 
$C: Huh, TIL. Thanks.
$C: I stand corrected.
$C: Its making me furious. Who owns reddit?  Do they get paid to hide it? 
$C: It was top of my front which is how I found it originally.  I don't know what being quarantined means in Reddit context.
$C: Aha. Old Phil is gold. He’s grown so much over the years. I really think he’s credibility shines through, he promotes open discussion and will disclaim his biases if they’re relevant to the story.
$C: Maybe just the cost of an extra GB added onto a data plan for the rest of the month.
$C: Gotcha. Thanks
$C: Yeah, I can understand that. We live in interesting times, if theres a war going on its with information and data as nukes. Even all these leaks and scandals seem like theyre orchestrated in some weird illuminati way...

$C: Oh, no, I'm joking. They are doing this because the Sinclair group, their owner, gave them a script and controls the stories. This isn't conspiracy theory, this is pretty well documented.

Saying it's an April Fool's joke was absurdist
$C: Lol dumb ass. No it's not.
$C: They didn't run it as an ad, and it was only during news casts but even the anchors thought it was ridiculous and they love to see their face on tv as much as possible
$C: What's your stance on a media organization like NPR? Also corrupt? Are some more corrupt than others?
$C: It is Trump's propaganda
$C: Has beaten "Thanks, Obama" 

this is a close race.
$C: people pay money to show support 
$C: It's something you can gift someone on Reddit for a post or comment. It doesn't necessarily mean anything but people often "gild" someone if they think a post is particularly exceptional.
$C: [you know thats true, and the frogs are suffering because of it](http://news.berkeley.edu/2010/03/01/frogs/)
$C: I don't understand, it doesn't even have the context anymore.

128 years worth of gold wtf.
$C: Jesus christ, wtf? I think he broke reddit that day.
$C: Some shady shit. I can’t see it on top all time posts either but this should be there according to upvotes 
$C: Europe.
$C: Thank you 
$C: there was one with >200 cant remember where it is
$C: Thanks, that makes sense. ‘Stay woke’ I guess the kids are saying these days eh?  Good that someone has been able to identify this manipulation 
$C: Thanks for the answer. 
$C: yyyyyyeah, I'm unsure if I believe that 

$C: now it's #2 top post of all time on reddit but it's not in the '[Top Scoring Links](https://www.reddit.com/r/all/top/?sort=top&t=all)'
$C: Everyone please read the comment from /u/BigEvilTurtle to see the terrible mindset most nations have. You believe that next time voting in someone will make a difference. Corporations RUN GAME and it doesn't matter who's voted in. You also don't live in a democracy, again showing that American's need way way way better education. 
$C: You're an awesome person who is highly creative and talented, thank you and have a great day too! :D
$C: You said he is just as bad, and then proceeded to describe a series of behaviors that are absolutely not as bad. 
$C: >He is just as bad.

As what? As bad as a large company buying local news stations to force them to push a narrative that would only be found on fox news under the guise of being from that station? 

I mean sure his formula seems to be say a few facts they researched, play a clip, and then make a joke, but he isn't a news channel. It's an entertainment show that goes over issues or topics that generally aren't covered by the media and provides some information on them while poking fun at some of the ridiculousness. 

I don't see the comparison. 

$C: Umm is he a news channel or a "tonight show" ??
$C: This is why you always need to put an /s
$C: Holy shit you're right, MOOOOOODS!!!
$C: The successes of Obama? You have been listening to the media too much.
$C: College kids grew up under George Bush? interesting.  When they were 10 years old?
$C: Most of the clips were. 
$C: Really? I wonder if every action obama made was so meticulously dissected the way trumps are. So spare me with the idiot bs, is he perfect??? 
Absolutely not. And for him being an idiot, he has to be the biggest idiot ever, bc he did something 20+ candidates couldn’t and win. 

I use to watch Cnn before he got elected, and solely cnn bc that’s all I knew ( never ever watched Fox, or msnbc). Didn’t really care if he won or lost, I wasn’t put off by the idea of him winning bc he was different. I wasn’t opposed to HC winning either bc she would’ve been the first female potus. When he won, cnn changed and you can tell.

I watch Fox now, but still put cnn every once in a while just to stay objective.

He will never do anything right. He could get rid of hunger, and they’ll give credit to obama. 

If what I’m saying isn’t evident, what narrative will they use this week? As of Thursday, the stormy Daniels situation was dying down, and all of a sudden they begin to speak about obstruction. I wonder if that’ll continue into the week. First it was collusion, then obstruction, then racism, then mental fitness, now? They’ll make the choice. 

Edit look at you losers downvote the truth. you don’t like it 😂😂 ?
$C: He is extremely dangerous to our democracy

$C: AKA the truth.
$C: The biggest scandal in modern history was perpetrated by Obama, Hillary, Comey, Rice, Mueller, the FBI, DOJ, CIA, and other leftists:

https://www.bongino.com/february-28-2018-ep-665-a-timeline-of-the-biggest-scandal-in-modern-american-history/
$C: They don't agree with the truth.  But the story about the real scandal, that involving Obama, Hillary, Comey, Rice, the DNC, Mueller and others is slowly coming to light.
$C: Go to r/all and sort by top rated in the last 24 hours. For some reason this thread doesn't show up even though it's the second most upvoted post of the day.
$C: What liberal media groups??

This is the most frustrating thread I've been in for a while.
$C: Australia
$C: To elaborate

This is funny but a little different than what's happening in OP's video. Every station subscribes to one or more newsgathering services that provide video and scripts that they can plug into their newscasts. The Conan bit is just them being lazy and not rewriting any of the leads/intros they were provided.

OP's video is a "must-run" segment from Sinclair. Stations are forced to run this; they don't have a choice.

This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: It is still bad, its the "diet" version of that Sinclair is doing and it IS still dangerous. 
$C: Yes, it is.  Why do we need the fcc and regulation?  Because of the downside of capitalism like he said. Unregulated capitalism devolves into monopolies. Monopolies in media is worse than almost any other sector. Hence why he said, “it’s one of the many downsides of capitalism”. 
$C: To be clear it was the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that allowed this to happen, before that there were strict rules about how many media outlets any corporation could own in any area. And it was neoliberal Bill Clinton who pushed hard for this deregulation.
$C: Actually the opposite https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/05/after-approving-comcastnbc-deal-fcc-commish-becomes-comcast-lobbyist/

The FCC is in bed with the big corporations. The FCC, like most other regulatory agencies are in bed with the largest corporations of each industry.  This phenomenon is called the Revolving Door. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: > You want to know how these big companies shit all over alternative media outlets? It's by getting regulations and laws passed that affect their competitors more than them

Well in this particular case, it was the FCC allowing them to merge with / buy the owners of other local networks. 

This is simply a case of market consolidation, which would have happened much faster *without* the government. The failure in this particular case is the government didn't do enough to block these mergers. 

There was a rule in place that prevented a single media company from owning too many local stations, and the FCC repealed that rule. They effectively just stepped aside to let the free market do what the free market does naturally on its own: consolidate and monopolize.

And now that Sinclair has aligned itself with the Republican party and the Trump administration, it has a powerful propaganda machine at its disposal. The trouble is that people who were smart enough to know Fox News is right wing propaganda by reputation, might not know that Sinclair is too, and that their local news anchors are now part of that same machine. It's far more insidious than Fox News. 
$C: Capitalism is not the reason alternative media outlets exist. That honor belongs to the first amendment.

Also capitalism is not a form of government.  It is economic theory.
$C: >Yeah, because under a society where the government owns and runs the media we'd have something totally different.

Those aren't the only two options.
$C: Seriously doubt Conan is shaking in his boots buddy
$C: You realize the government does own and run the media right lol
$C: Yes, there's a lot of confusion over it, and people blame any existence of monopolies on capitalism.  However in capitalism, you don't see monopolies created with the help of the government. https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/05/after-approving-comcastnbc-deal-fcc-commish-becomes-comcast-lobbyist/

What we have here is a modern form of mercantilism.  Some people call it corporatism because corporations can't exist in the legal limited liability sense without the help of the government. 
$C: > agreed. It's capitalism hijacked. it's bought and paid for, public manipulation, disguised as capitalism. Capitalism sabotage by the regime trying to destroy the free market. You can say it's modern day mercantilism.


$C: However, in a truly capitalist society, you could start your own TV station.  What we have is a modern form of mercantilism where the regulatory bodies are in bed with the most powerful companies of each industry being regulated.  This phenomenon is called The Revolving Door.  The FCC chair who presided over the Comcast/NBC merger quit to take a job with the new conglomerate after approving its creation. You can't easily do things that big corporations do because of the regulatory hurdles put in place. People often confuse mercantilism with capitalism because both systems can have large corporations that rule entire industries,  The difference is one does so with the help of the government (mercantilism), and the other one (capitalism) does not.


Edit:  The fuck happened to your original comment? 
$C: Technically Obama repealed the Smith Mundant Act (part of the NDAA) which basically legalized domestic propaganda just FYI. Personally I think both sides vote differently on morally ambiguous topics to give the illusion of choice. While voting almost identical on anything of real significance especially militarily and financially. There's very little public policy anyway, corporate lobbying accounts for the majority of new legislation. Legally corporations are people so politicians aren't totally lying about representing the people. Good luck with whatever side you're with tho, I'm sure they'll change all this. Happy Easter! 
$C: Wait, I though it was the left that was campaigning against fake news on social media....and the right feels that the MSM is fake news....

Did you mix up your talking points or have the left moved the goalposts again?
$C: You are exaggerating a bit.
$C: Just like when the socialists in our society are blaming the top 1%  for everything. Sounds familiar
$C: Very well put. Sadly it will probably be lost on most people who will carry on shouting at the other side, while refusing to see the big picture.
$C: How is that pro conservative? If Don Lemon had read that exact script word for word, people would assume it was a knock on Fox News.
$C: Was my entire newsroom full of Democrats? Absolutely.  They didn’t hide it either. You should have seen the shitstorm that went down when it came to deciding who was going to cover the local watch parties.  Nobody wanted to go to the Republican Party and even our resident Bernie supporter was strongly resisting going to the Democrat watch party.  Sitting in on just one news meeting will reveal a lot.  When I was working at an Atlanta station, our news director didn’t even try to hide the face he had no objectivity whatsoever.  He got good and drunk at the Christmas party once and once said (loudly) “I won’t hire any fucking Republicans”.

This guy is now a regional news director for Gray Television so I expect his influence trickles down.  Gray, Nexstar, Tribune (at least for now)....they’re all doing this. Scary business these days. Journalism has clearly lost its way. Print journalism has as well.  I want out so bad.
$C: CNN is co-opted by the CIA (Mockingbird), The big 4 ran non stop propaganda justifying the invasions of iraq and Afghanistan, PBS and NPR are both state funded, The BBC is as much state run as RT probably more because they continually push propaganda outside of news and in entertainment.

CCTV (Chinese state broadcaster in English) and Aljazera, owned by Saudi royalty so effectively state run, aren't banned.

You are criticizing RT's broadcast of the ukranina unrest without having seen it because somebody who told you they are trustworthy and RT is not with no trustworthy references, just circular reasoning told you to think so.

Left leaning media does have a super majority in film, television, print web media platforms and news, a small number of leftist companies own ~80% of all media in our country.

To say the left is beyond criticism on this because you've moved goalposts "local news" is a clear bias.
$C: It is not [OPs video](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/88ll08/this_is_what_happens_when_one_company_owns_dozens/dwm4r43/)
$C: Still trying to find where I said it should not be spread..

Can you help me please and identify where I said that. thankyou.
$C: Trying to find where I said it should not be spread as far and wide as possible!.

It is a deplorable situation that should be highlighted at every opportunity.


$C: Hi, you seem to be ignoring my question where I ask you to show where I have stated that the information should not be spread.

I think you should stand by your statement with proof, or retract is as incorrect.
$C: It is not [OPs video](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/88ll08/this_is_what_happens_when_one_company_owns_dozens/dwm4r43/)
$C: You did not answer my question.

Why are they giving OP Gold for a video they simply posted?

It is ludicrous.
$C: At least you 'read' that stone tablet vs staring at it with your mouth open, while it tries to convince you to keep staring.
$C: I care, I really do, but I don't want to have my head filled with any more bullshit that is contrived and counter-productive to what actual real change that can be had.  The disinformation misinformation isn't new at all, but to feel on-guard all the time is exhausting.  What I can do is try to be proactive in searching out different sources and what change I can handle within my space.  If I can be apart of something bigger that I feel will progress our species, I'm all for it, otherwise, I don't want to be fed bullshit anymore.
$C: And the fact that Comcast is one of those is most disturbing to me.
$C: Normally I say Kentucky in the middle. Pennsyltucky sounds better than Pennsylbama
$C: And I'd say it's a self correcting problem that will fade out with the boomers, but this really pales in comparison to the Cambridge Analytica manipulation. 
$C: Thank you, so would you agree the obvious theme here is that these stations are being spoon fed some story from the top and not having any journalism input about it?
$C: I'm talking about the [Sinclair](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/03/local-news-anchors-now-have-to-read-pro-trump-propaganda.html) media group. 

>Every news station under Sinclair’s umbrella is required to syndicate commentary that comports with its owners’ ideological views. Over the past 13 months, this has meant regularly providing viewers with the insights of Sinclair’s chief political analyst, former Trump spokesman Boris Epshteyn. It has also meant featuring analysis from conservative pundit Mark Hyman, and updates from the “Terrorism Alert Desk” (sensationalized coverage of recent terror attacks from around the world) on a routine basis.
$C: I am okay with scripts for reporting stories that might occur out of market.  CNN has a service to provide local stations with video (and optional scripts) to cover stories like this. (http://www.cnnnewsource.com/).

It's wrong for opinion pieces though.
$C: What if they don't run with the script?  Just fire the station manager  or news director and install one that complies?

One of my local stations, KTLA, is part of the Sinclair purchase from Tribune.  Surely such a switch in content /bias will be jarring to existing viewers and make them turn off in droves?
$C: I actually forgot what I commented there, and it got deleted. Was my comment: "*Republicans*: *So*?"

$C: And when people see videos like this, they start trusting those sources more so not because they believe they're honest but because they've lost trust towards liberal sources. 
$C: I'm pushing it real good. 
$C: I clicked immediately too and it was gone instantly.  Could you PM me possibly?
$C: That's not answering my question. What's the story?
$C: As are all Redditors fellow Redditor.
$C: You=Russian (or an idiot)
$C: [deleted]
$C: Thank you very much
$C: Thanks it was only the last bit I had trouble with 
$C: I prefer not to get my news from a nightly comedy show. I prefer to watch the news......oh...wait....
$C: Wow thanks for the write up. Appreciate you informing me. I kind of was assuming that what this meant, was essentially controlling flow of information to people who view it as gospel. To be fair though, seems like either side has an agenda and use whatever media means they have to slant an argument one way or another.
$C: It's insanity man.  I see it as "hey, don't listen all that Facebook and Internet crap, we're the real news.  Watch us."  Which is consistent with their business model.  I see absolutely nothing wrong with this at all.  
$C: And the representatives are controlled and represent mostly the interest of some rich oligarchs. 
$C: That is such bs
$C: I wouldn't doubt any of that..
$C: FWIW, they don't seem to have any stations in my area (Fairfield County, CT) which explains why I'm not familiar with the company.

From my perspective, the media market is saturated from the other direction. Every station I tune in is expressive of Far Left opinions and disparaging remarks about the President, or NPR.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I'm surprised that they're ok with it too...
$C: I saw it from Reddit Front Page and also being subscribed to r/videos. No other way I can think of for now, at least that's how I did it above without any issue. 

Nice editing by the way of the video.
$C: This is dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: Dont you understand that its both sides doing this? Left and Right wing MSM is controlled by just a handful of extremely rich people. Those rich people write the scripts or in other words dictate their own political agenda.
$C: I’m a Trump supporter. Not a Republican supporter or Democrat supporter. 
$C: Yet many will still defy reality. "Yea the media is brainwashing people... And hating Trump has been their #1 agenda for 2 years... But they're right about that one."

There's a reason they rarely talk policy. Because his policy is common sense, and it works. 50 year low in unemployment claims. 50% approval rating (Obama was 46% at this time). Record stock market. Factories rushing back to the US. Big trade deal wins. North Korean denuclearization looks imminent. ISIS decimated (who?). New York lower murder rate than London for first time. Regulations slashing freeing up businesses. Big tax cut unburdens middle class. Did I mention jobs? 

It's honestly hilarious to see how long some people can cling to complete lies in the name of hating this man 
$C: Fox is, CNN is not.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I love it when Fox news is attacked when just about every other news outlet is outright left or leans that way.

At least one network reports news that you wouldn't hear anywhere else.

$C: Dude stfu. Media is 90%anti trump. If he spent his whole day trying to yell at that it would be wasted.. your TDS is showing
$C: Jesus...
Youre really engulfed as a partisan.

Take off your tinted glasses, this is happening on all media fronts whether left or right.
$C: CNN is not trustworthy, friend. Without getting into this vs. that, can we admit that this type of programming is across the board? Only differing in spin of content? We have to think beyond the red herring of this vs. that.
$C: The fuck are on about? These stations are all owned by a single company.
$C: This is my 2 cents... but there isn’t a news station that’s actually true to the core. I was all for the fake news movement, but fuck. ‘My side’ (I’m a republican) needs to understand that the fake news movement can apply, and should apply, to Fox just as much as any liberal news source. They’re all guilty. 
$C: Six media companies control 90% of the news and they’re not partisan. 
$C: This had all the major news stations save CNN, so both sides were included. 
$C: How the fuck is this Trump? Btw there are no two parties. Only one. And it's goal is to divide and conquer. Sorry you've fallen so far to one side brother. 
$C: *cringe* yeah you got it all figured out lmao
$C: You realize that there were CBS and ABC logos mixed in there, right?

> I believe news media that reaffirms what I already believe.


$C: He didn’t endorse Moore. But nice try, he endorsed his opponent in the republicans primary... a fact  the media pounced  on when he lost.
$C: Fuck that.
$C: You want he's presidency to end 2 months and 10 days in to the final year of his second term? Why?
$C: This video literally groups them together, genius. And Right-Wing? Way to make assumptions. Of course that makes sense, given how everyone is conditioned to hate them.
$C: I used to work for Sinclair in CA. Most stuff we used does not fall under that restriction at all. You just use whatever CBS/NBC/CNN has up online. And you can take the time to re-write content so it is ideal for your audience and also accurate. Even packages don't necessarily need to have the given introduction, unless it states that on the site. But yeah, we did have occasional promos/fundraisers/Clear the shelters stuff. Most stories have absolutely no reason to sound exactly the same at every station, especially considering you shouldn't be THAT reliant on network stuff. But I came from a print background so I found it pretty offensive that we would sell people the same unoriginal stories without tailoring it even slightly to them. Producers decades older than, didn't feel the same way. I guess I was the odd man out! 
$C: Yes, they are associated with Fox (obvious right-wing biased there) ... and also CBS, NBC, etc. Do you really think CBS ... Bakersfield fucking California is right wing?
$C: I know that but it still seems odd, expecially with the channel having no following.  And tomorrow this video will be spread everywhere so it would not be an accurate way to view the current viewer stats. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: I agreere
$C: [deleted]
$C: I guess it would be a very good way of spreading propaganda, but do we actually have reason to believe they're using it for that purpose?
$C: Right. Like Fox, CNN, CBS, and NBC. 
$C: Where in the script did they accuse major news media outlets of pushing fake news?
$C: Yeah, I was thinking that might be it. 
$C: Lemme guess... the *real* issue is that your team doesn't propagandize but the other team does?
$C: Who gives a shit who is pro this or that. Fake news is a real thing, it doesn't matter who fucking says it.
$C: It's an editorial statement.  It's not being promoted as news.  Yeah, I get that Sinclair owns many stations in many markets, but it is saying all the right things.
I just don't think it is as bad as the post is implying.
$C: So, that's way less sinister than CNN which is doing the same thing but pretending not to be biased...
$C: Hey King...I don't usually reply but you actually didn't immediately insult me and i'm surprised by that.  Thank you.

Watch what Trump says (literally watch an entire speech), then watch what most main stream outlets say...they totally script it and take it out of context on EXACTLY the same points.

I said God Bless Trump because his movement is exposing it in America, and in my opinion, it's wonderful. 
$C: Well. Sorta. I record news from one channel and rebroadcast it on another channel 30 minutes later. One thing I have noticed from the particular station I work for is that they're branded as 2 separate channels but both studios are in the same building. Sometimes they even have the same anchors too. For sure they have the same graphics.

I can't really say I buy into them all controlling media and convoluding among themselves. I just see this as a mass text sent to every station.
$C: Nah. Too easy. Gotta start local.  Also for everyone reading this - vote local as well. Dont listen to tools like him. 
$C: Cable news is not the future.  Let them devour the market & eventually die to decentralized media on the internet.  No interventionism necessary.  The spread of information should not be regulated.

Videos like this help accompish my goals
$C: Are you kidding me? All news sources except for Fox News is anti-trump and that's just common knowledge. Idk why you're even trying to bring politics into this
$C: You mean Sinclair media group stations.
$C: It’s much easier to push a single agenda when you own most of the networks.  It would be easier to push support for laws, political parties, and viewpoints.  You control the stories as well as any rebuttals against it. 
$C: wants to play farcry 5 irl
$C: Thanks I know someone would pull through for me
$C: [deleted]
$C: Look, I know what Sinclair is up to. I'm not defending the network's overall positions.    
All I'm saying is- this video -a bunch of reporters who work for the same national company reading the company's mission statement, with minor changes to address the local markets isn't sinister.   
I read a lot of comments ITT where people are shocked "ooh they're all saying the same thing."  Well no shit.   
It's like being surprised every McDonald's has the same menu, or hangs the same ads in their restaurants.
$C: Nothing in controversial about what they are saying; simply that unsourced, bias news is dangerous. That's objectively true and should be said in unison by us all. This video is disturbing only to those who don't think too deeply into what they are watching- yes people saying the same thing with horror movie type effects is disturbing, but not the content.  Why would someone try to attack this message? Do they and the rest of Reddit want unsourced, biased media?
$C: I understand. When you're young sometimes it is hard to think and see things clearly.  Take your time, read the comments in this thread and you can learn a little something. 
$C: Do you only communicate in reddit-speak and meme language? 
$C: >The left can admit that CNN=Fox News on the other side of the isle. 

fox broadcasts lies knowingly, its not among the respectable press. cnn is.


$C: Actually no, republicans have constantly made it easier for mass corporations to form as well as repealed conflict of interest laws. 
$C: Lol, please. Youre all fucking hypocrites with zero integrity https://imgur.com/a/VXl1K
$C: Careful. Fake news has been taken over to just mean anything you don’t like. It was actually complaining about CNN fake news, not info wars. Sinclair has been pushing right wing agenda for a long time, which is the group that owns all the stations in the video.

https://www.mediamatters.org/networks-and-outlets/sinclair-broadcast-group-inc
$C: Actually, it has been a thing for decades.  The [Telecommunications Act of 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996) signed by Bill Clinton allowed media cross-ownership.  The result was that all the big news outlets bought up all the smaller ones.  We haven't really had unbiased news since 1996.

$C: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=scripted+news
$C: [deleted]
$C: It most fucking too has been a thing for decades. Fucking media conglomerates have owned multiple stations in multiple markets for fucking years.
$C: Another talking parrot head lol
$C: All those channels are fake new
$C: Nah. They just produce yellow journalism. It's blatantly obvious 
$C: No liberal stations do this. 90% of Hollywood doesn't have the same opinion. All late night talk show hosts aren't passionately against the president. NBC, ABC and CBS doesn't interject the same progressive politics into all of its shows. Viacom didn't make all of its television networks go dark for 17 minutes to support the gun control marches. 

No, it's the conservative local stations and Fox News we need to do something about. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: You're not wrong, but it's consistently wrong to refer to us as a democracy.  It's more of a 20th century thing that has stuck after being said far too many times.  Perhaps if we called things as they are people could understand the country and what it stands for more.  If they want a democracy, they can move to a communist/socialist country and see how they like it because all democracies die from in the inside of losers "voting for freebies over freedom" and become Oligarchies of equally poor and miserable except for the elite leadership.
$C: Right-wing media has a tendency to do that.
$C: [removed]
$C: [removed]
$C: Negative, dude, I watched to count 'em.  All networks are represented.  Sinclair Communications owns many TV stations, and each station has its own network affiliation.  There's Fox, CBS, NBC, ABC, and CW.  Because it doesn't matter whose programming the station carries, the station itself is owned by Sinclair.
$C: [removed]
$C: We are.  This rule is being applied ONLY against right wing posts.

It's all or nothing.
$C: >I also want to kick your stupid teeth in

You aren't living up to your username
$C: Oh im sorry I didnt realize one form of censorship was less serious then another.

Think before you speak please.
$C: Trump does stupid and harmful things to America. This is extremely dangerous for our democracy.
$C: It is now.
$C: Fuck off, Colbert cocksucker.
$C: Yeah it should probably be on trending too. Posts with this many upvotes often are. 
$C: I thought you all kept guns to stop this though

well so I keep getting rammed down my throat

Its now been proven that even what President you elect is done this way....... and you still allow it.
$C: I think every time I say something like this, people ask me for what my great plan is lmfao, do you really want me to lay out a step by step plan for civilization? I guess you could pay me to work on one but I think there are probably better qualified people.
$C: Silly billy, that's what they say about you.
$C: So you are aware they are idiots
$C: Trump supporters are like one big [news digesting human centipede](https://i.redd.it/lc8p4kow5ebz.png). 
$C: still waitin on that evidence bud....
$C: I'm from Mississippi. My redneck family never went to college. I love and trust them because they learned from experiences. Experience is a far better teacher than standardized tests. 
$C: Anything to say about the video.
$C: Because college is politically unbiased ofcourse
$C: why would you accuse me of lying what would I have to gain by lying?
$C: But they are fake. Just like president Trump said. Doesn’t matter pro or not. What part of fake don’t you get ? Try again how not fake they are.
$C: Robot? No. You are probably living in you parents basement, eating hot pockets, playing Xbox, and scratching your cats head and telling her she’s a good girl. How’s that for robot?
$C: You are the perfect example of the problem. 
$C: No, because this is not a post to bash Trump. It's a post to tell people to put their political differences aside and fact check. The media should not be your go to source for information (As the video above very clearly pointed out.
$C: Again, I really really really don't want this to turn into another political fist fight but for the sake of proof...

Under Trump's presidency Black Unemployment is at it's lowest yet.

The Dow Jones reached a record high.

There'e been a move to boost computer sciences in Education Department programs.

Opened up the North American Free Trade Agreement for talks to better the deal for the U.S.

Signed three executive orders aimed at cracking down on international criminal organizations.

Signed the Veterans Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act to allow senior officials in the Department of Veterans Affairs to fire failing employees and establish safeguards to protect whistleblowers.

I could go on and on but that really wasn't the point of my comment. The point is don't let the fake news media sway you. The video above clearly shows the news is just puppets
$C: It's against the sub rules.        
I don't know what your problem is, I agree with the video in that is's fucking retarded, but come on... we all know how MSM works, all channels.
$C: Yup, of course.        
Name me a MSM network that you can't apply this to? This is how they work.
$C: lol, yes of course they are! All networks get their new talking points from the same sources.          
It's shit and we all know it, but it doesn't only apply to these channels alone, you do know that?
$C: OK, your first point is obvious and we all saw it in the video.              
Your second point you seem to have missed the part where I say MSM not independant networks. So we agree there as well.
$C: Pretty much. 
$C: This is fundamental to our country’s structure, not semantics. Democracy = mob rule.

And yes, a very sad (I’d argue intentional) byproduct of our education system. All my legal, 1st generation immigrant friends who have become citizens in the past 10-15 years immediately point out the same to me when they hear this. They are shocked it’s never questioned and how often it’s mis-stated. 

A semantic difference I could see might be “republic” vs. “constitutional republic”, but democracy has very little to do with representation. This is absolutely essential to our process, checks and balances, etc.
$C: Never said Trump wouldn’t join the bandwagon himself.  To me it’s good to have any kind of awareness of media coercion.  Also, it doesn’t take but a simple google search to see that Sinclair is a conservative mouthpiece.  My comment wasn’t intended to be partisan at all.
$C: What do you think your comment has to do with my comment ? 
$C: huh, weird.
$C: I dont like that 1 bit.

You can run the same information new story without using word for word the same script.
$C: Very much so, I like to think I'm up on things (going back to the Clear Channel days of buying up local radio stations) but this was something I was not aware of at all, until now.
$C: So are these guys pretending to care orrr? 
$C: Or morons, like you
$C: I honestly thought there was more to it than that but... I was wrong
$C: Not saying it was. A conservative mindset vs a progressive one means that you are more inclined to believe something if you agree with is, while a true progressive means that you are more open. “Conservative progressives” or far lefts also suffered from the fake news issue in the election. Black communities were targeted in order to convince them not to go out and vote. 
That isn’t really the issue with what I am talking about though. 

This broad cast doesn’t actually show any bias. It’s more of a PSA to fact check the shit you read on social media. I personally think that it was a good call by the CEO. 
$C: There are many. Best one is msnbc claiming not to lean left or right but “forward” 
$C: Right I'm talking about the rest of the media being funded by corporations and thus reflecting their values, its whats happening here except displayed in an obviously comical fashion just from face value. 

Not sure whats controversial about this?
$C: Thanks. It does seem like Sinclair is an investment group.


Gross. I can only imagine what other things share holders are tied up in.
$C: Good post! I listen to NPR every day, and they ALWAYS have left and right commentary on major headlines.
$C: This is also what they want
$C: It was “funny” at first when people wanted certain news to be real or relevant. But they aren’t. Elon has had to call out news outlets as well. “Respectable” one’s at that. It doesn’t even have to be false. Just purposefully pulled out of context or made a “top story” even if it’s a nothing burger. 

Take for instance the top story on every iPhone news app. All day today. A picture of bezos laughing with the title “trump campaign offices sometimes bought office supplies from amazon”. Like fucking seriously?! Yes it’s true. But it’s not news. Fake fucking news. 
$C: What’s funny is, after more digging. This was put together by deadspin it seems. The monologue at the beginning is scripted and even announced before (cut from the clip of course) Then deadspin took them all and produced this. And this is actually being used now as anti-trump propaganda. 

All of this is bullshit. And we all got played. Way to go us. 
$C: That's hilarious. You consider those morons sitting at their desks, journalists? Most of the time they don't even know what they are going to say before it pops up on the teleprompter. They have been puppets for a long time.
$C: I just wanted to come and something because this had a lot of upvotes
$C: so what do we do?
$C: Thanks for pointing that out but this is within the boundaries of my  estatement http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/13051-obamas-fcc-set-to-give-rupert-murdoch-a-media-monopoly

However many Obama lovers won't see it even if you painted it in front of their faces.
$C: You'll get over it. It's not even about him, but it's related. Enjoy your day hun
$C: The video I watched was about Sinclair Broadcast Group, but you continue misunderstanding the difference between Fox and Fox News.

Remember - one is an alt-right propaganda machine, and the other is a bunch liberal Hollywood cucks - and they're all the same company!
$C: I don't get my news from local news stations, so it's not like I care. If people are stupid enough to mindlessly consume the shit they see on TV, I would argue that that's their own fault.
$C: Is CNN and MSNBC owned by Sinclair? The point of the video is demonstrating that these news organizations parroting this weird speech are all owned by one major company.
$C: This is what they want. Distrust of all media/journalism=good for corporate overlords
$C: so where do you get your news from? 
$C: Disney, Comcast, Warner, Amazon, Google, comes to mind, but theyre on team corporate democrat so no one gives a fuck.
$C: I missed the main point, I half watched it at work and thought it was about unoriginal writing. I see what people are saying now that I watched it again 
$C: They report too many facts. Have to label them as biased, fake news. 
$C: Then don’t watch it. I really don’t see how this is any different to CNN running their own political agenda. Hell, at least Sinclair is upfront about it.
$C: Do we have anything confirming that?
$C: We're going to do this tired dance? Do you know how annoying it is to be catagorized in such a one dimensional way in every single post on reddit? Do you honestly think i'm russian? Have you ever actually been to that subreddit? Do you have a single thought or biase of your own in your head or is it entirely filled to the brim with leftist kool aide? 

Is this your idea of punching a nazi in the face? Coming online and being a brain washed, smarmy cunt?

Nice username, it suits you.

I feel like bill murray in ground hogs day. Every time i see a red letter in my box it's some annoying fuck outting me for my own personal freedom of speech as if that somehow makes me less of a person or invalidates my argument. I should wear a red letter on the street to make it easier for you pacifists to punch me in the face.
$C: I really wasn't being sarcastic at all I just wanted to be educated. 
$C: Butts?
$C: I totally get that.  Thanks.

Overwhelmingly republican
$C: Forgot this  /s 

In case some people don't get you actually linked to website showing sinclair broadcast group donates to republicans
$C: Except newspapers are so broke they can’t afford to send reporters anywhere anymore. They can either not report the story or run an AP article. 
$C: Sorry, I didn't realize that a professional news organization informing their viewers on the literal plague of "fake news" (or whatever you want to call it) that has taken over sites like Facebook.

The only halfway questionable quote in the entire video is when they claim themselves to be a "balanced news source", which is far from a call for outrage.

I just.. don't understand. How is this *any* different from Fox news playing this script on a national broadcast? Is the fact that it was played on several local news stations, instead of just the national one somehow creepy or disturbing, even though it probably effectively reached a lesser amount of viewers?

edit: It's also, not by any stretch of the imagination, "supposed" fake news. Please go to facebook or any article on the internet without adblock. You will be barraged with objectively false headlines and stories.
$C: Because people are more likely to watch a normal report. As soon as a program says something among the lines of "and now a message from our founders/sponsor/parent company" people change the channel. Plus a lot of news stations copy each other or do things similarly. If target made a public apology, McDonald's or even apple, it would probably sound extremely similar. Not because they're all controlled by a secret society, but because events in the past set standards for how we expect companies to respond to situations and the public would like to see other companies do the same. Since it can be difficult to form your own statements that are politically correct and don't offend anyone, most companies will use ones that have worked in the past as a model or template. 
$C: I prefer independent journalists on YouTube
$C: Yes.
$C: 1) How am I being a dick?  and 2) Why do you care?
$C: No, all news is complete bullshit. Although, on the bullshit scale, fox is not the worst, sorry buddy.
$C: Yep
$C: No. Because they use the same phrases, buzz words and lead ins across all 3 major networks, MSNBC and some times FoxNews as well.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Did you watch the same video that I did? They were taking a stand against fake news and biased journalism. Their speech isn't biased, just scripted. 
$C: Were those segments obviously parroted by other stations as well like the above video? If not, how can you say Sinclair HAD the stations air them? Not saying you're wrong, I just don't know the facts, maybe you do.

For the record, I'm about as far from a trump supporter or fox news fan as you can get, I'm just struck by what appears to be a bit of jumping to conclusions. 
$C: Hmm, how many burgers are you offering?
$C: And what about Fox that are featured a bunch of times? ABC? CBS?

$C: And what about Fox that are featured a bunch of times? ABC? CBS?

Shall I continue?
$C: Because putting out a script talking about the dangers of social media posts are clearly talking about Hillary posts and the danger Hillary represents to our democracy
$C: Source?
$C: Propaganda is a pejorative terms used to describe political news and views that disagree with ones own views.

People on the right aren’t stupid.  If Sinclair broadcasts news which is blatantly wrong, people will tune it out.

The whole argument is based on the belief held by the left that they’re the smart ones, and people on the right are susceptible to being duped, so need to be shielded from “dangerous” news outlets.

Free speech doesn’t apply to conservatives, apparently 
$C: um... maybe you should reread my comment, it is refering to the fact that there are much more obvious examples of the imperiled fourth estate.

Also we don't live in a democracy, we live in a republic controlled by a plutocratic oligarchy... maybe you should read up on how government works...
$C: > this is given to them as mandatory content

source?
$C: Westworld reference
$C: Just point out the facts -- fake news and manipulated media has a Liberal bias 
$C: It's beyond common knowledge that the media is far left leaning. For instance Clinton shoving a cigar up his interns hoochie and all his affairs is his personal business yet Trump's sleeping with someone years and years ago is grounds for impeachment. 
$C: Not saying you're wrong, can I've a link to what Trump did that allowed them to do this?
$C: This thread was flagged and is now brigaded by PR firms.
$C: Already one comment without intelligence. May we continue?
$C: How is that any different from every news station/company in the history of Earth? Still no actual intelligent responses. You think CNN and MSNBC doesn't try to discredit in every story they publish? C'mon now....
$C: I'm acting like a shit ton of the voting population of this country and don't need to hear the sky is falling every single day for trivial shit that shouldn't matter. Most folks care primarilly for their self interest. If the economy and their paycheck is doing well, they don't give a fuck if he got 2 scoops of ice cream or not.

My point is if every little thing keeps you outraged, nobody besides your echo chamber will care when anything genuinely important breaks.
$C: What are you, the playground bully?
$C: Holy God, it's staggering to see it all laid out like that. 
$C: Thanks, I updated the list.
$C: Agreed. No idea how to stop the madness. 
$C: You do understand Republican ideology is for a more free, unregulated market? You better speak more vaguely when calling out half the nation.
$C: Thank you!
$C: Oh, I see.I thought you were just listing off the Sinclair stations

No I don't.  I'm probably wrong about it being WTTE.

$C: It already is, haven’t you noticed?
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: Give a nickname to captured democracy? 
$C: Extremely 
$C: A lapse in govt. vigilance led to corporations large enough to have undue sway over the govt. Itself.
$C: Correct, the state and business mixing is a natural part of capitalism.
$C: ...monopolies form and last when there is nothing to keep them in check.  It use to be the government broke up or prevented monopolies from forming so business started to buy government.  Now they just lobby to remove all of the protections against monopolies and swall things up.
$C: Correct, the state always works in favor of the ruling class. Thanks to capitalism, the state has allowed a handful of companies to own all the media in the country.
$C: Suddenly you're okay with a single message going out across the media when you realize it's a natural consequence of capitalism. You applaud it as an achievement and not a failure.
$C: "...3 were pronounced dead at the scene. Here's the latest update on the string of rapes at this local jogging trail... Stocks fell 5% due to trade negotiations breaking down... In other news, this 3-legged cat was adopted from the pound."

*click*
$C: Except Sinclair doesn't "control the vast majority of news on this country." The news apparatus in this country consists of more than a minority footprint of local news TV stations... Most Americans don't even get their news from local TV stations anymore. 
$C: Maybe I didn’t pay attention well enough, but I thought they were saying there was a lot of fake news out there, but you can trust us.  Not that everyone besides hem was fake news.
$C: I cut eye holes in mine so I'm like a patriotic ninja turtle
$C: This is why I've always hated the concept of nationalism and in most contexts, patriotism. It goes against my belief that we need to move past the mentality of tribalism, and it does nothing to fuel any kind of objective analysis of the state of a nation. It's god damn dangerous.
$C: Nationalism is a moron's lobotomy.
$C: >~~Patriotism~~ Nationalism is a fool's blindfold.

A patriot cares about their country. That can include criticism, and fighting for it's betterment. A nationalist insists that their country is best because it is their country.

Nothing is more dangerous to nationalist rhetoric than true patriots that refuse to shut up and follow the script.
$C: I will respectfully disagree. 

But I understand why one would choose to feel that way. 

>Patriotism is loving your country always. And your government when deserved. 

-Mark Twain
$C: Easy there, Jaden.
$C: Exactly, and sadly there are many people brainwashed with Chauvinist crap.
$C: No it isn't. Patriotism is love country and the principles it stands on. Many love the country but have abandoned the principles. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: There's nothing wrong with loving your country when it's objectively the best country to ever exist in known history, as far as human rights go. Meanwhile in UK, people are arrested for posting distasteful joke videos
$C: Tell that to my great grandfathers who fought both the nazis and  japanese. 


EDT: my great grandfather didn’t jump into France the day *BEFORE* D-Day as a pathfinder for people who live in comfort to criticize loving your own country. 
$C: The west has been so extremely good at Propaganda, most of its' citizens aren't even aware they're constantly exposed to it.

Do you think the average Russian or Chinese citizen doesn't realize their news is full of shit? They do; they just can't say it out loud without facing dire consequences. And it's no accident: The quality of their propaganda is god-awful.
$C: I'm pretty sure that's what he meant
$C: We are, they don't work so hard at hiding it.
$C: Trust me, there are way fewer .gov sponsored suicide in America.  Back then there were many people you don't look in the eye in Russia. 
$C: That's funny, cause from America Europe looks like a bunch of same-minded drones completely controlled by the government. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Nice try pro UK propaganda 
$C: It is fueled by American dollars.  I saw them.
$C: We bitch about it, They do it. 
$C: We're better because our propaganda tastes better obviously.
$C: > How are you way better than Russia?

Asking this question, I genuinely believe you're not a real person.

 Russia has literal state run media.
$C: This dude loves to post the same shit about Russia being awesome. Worst Kremlin troll ever.
$C: Russian people and russian .gov is way different. 
$C: Eat the rich.

The way the elites are getting everything they want as we squander under the misinformation propaganda they push is a great way to be dragged out into the streets revolution style. 
$C: Yes, they are something like the second worst offender.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Poland. I can think of like 15 more off the top of my head.
$C:  I'm against a single entity controlling the majority of a market. Monopolies are not good for the economy. Sinclair owns the local stations of 40% of American households. While they are not quite a monopoly, I personally am not willing to wait around while they finish becoming one.

Thanks for asking. How do you feel about it?
$C: Society outgrew feudalism, it outgrew mercantilism, and it will one day outgrow capitalism. The only reason we think it's special is because it's what we know. Just like how a citizen of ancient Rome couldn't imagine a world without slavery. 
$C: Many of the major technological innovations of the past 50+ years were brought about through DARPA (government) funding of university research programs, not created by private corporations for profit.
$C: Non-profits don’t have to be government funded. You could make your own right now. The funding can come from anywhere, but if it’s all publicly viewable it can be scrutinized, and held accountable by the public.
$C: > Special interests have bought off conservative politicians to get rid of the regulations and tax systems that are costing them money.

The same can be said of liberal politicians.

It's about politics, not the money. Politician would still collude with media to stay in power if there wasn't money involved.
$C: Liberalism is arguably more in favour of the free market than conservatism. 

Just because they’re a few feet to the left of conservatism doesn’t make them left of center. 
$C: This issue is that watching TV put you in an Alpha wave trance where all you hear and see by passes any thought processes which the brain accept as truth with zero ability to concern the actually truth.  Reading using a completely different part of the brain that can process truths and falsehoods.
$C: Shout-out to that one woman emphasized on *'This is'* instead of *'extremely'*, you broke their script! ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
$C: Yet even others may say that it is extremely dangerous to OUR democracy, while touching their chest for effect. 
$C: See, i've only heard that this is EXTREMELY dangerous to our democracy...but really, it doesn't take a genius to see that this is EXTREMELY dangerous to our democracy.
$C: The GOP is monumentally dangerous for your ~~oligarchy~~ democracy. 
$C: I heard it from that social media websites like YouTube and Reddit where everyday people think they are the news
$C: This is extremely dangerous to my disbelief in psychic powers.
$C: I don't even live in the US, yet this still applies to my own country, and it's still essentially the same oligarchs.

This is extremely dangerous to my hope for the future.
$C: But in a more real sense it is actually a democracy because it has fair and free elections with an orderly transfer of power and a rigorous system of laws and norms to keep a tyrant at bay. 

Those who control the wealth in America quite obviously do not hold ultimate sway over the government and laws as the government frequently takes actions which will hurt their pocketbooks. The argument that the media really controls anything is even more flimsy given how highly mistrusted they are. 

You obviously think you’re one of the people who can see past the bullshit, but frankly you quite obviously don’t even understand what you’re saying and are using words for effect rather than their substance. There is not some small cadre of oligarchs that controls the nation, that simply is not the case and there is no evidence to back this up. 
$C: Original ideas are extremely dangerous to our war with Eurasia.

We must win our war with Eastasia.
$C: So it’s treason then?
$C: You're right about that. That sub is the least Canadian thing I can think of. 
$C: Ok, well the solution is to vote in November for politicians who will pass and ENFORCE antitrust legislation. No more half-measures. We need to break up monopolies like we did in the 1930s. 
$C: The mechanism is the erosion of antitrust regulations, and before that the end of the Fairness Doctrine. This is a problem that can and must be solved by laws.
$C: > The mechanism that allows one group to control this much media 

Ajit Pai's FCC. 
$C: > Don't try to pin this only on Sinclair, like if we get rid of them the problem is solved.

Sinclair is the only group stupid/daring enough to do this. 

No other group has dared to consider crossing the line between journalism and propaganda like this at the local level. 

The FCC rules (currently in place) prevent a single group from owning more than a certain number of outlets in a market. As long as that protection is in place, the public will help ensure that they can't endure by voting with their remotes. 

I used to work in local news - I'm not sure what you're cynical about, but it's not a bad as National/Cable outlets. 
$C: Yes, the non conformity is what's happy. The mechanism that allones one group of bots to control the forums is what's scary. Don't try to pin this only on Neo nazis, there's also russian bots.

Thats how you ignore how worse this is.
$C: >The mechanism that allows one group to control this much media is what's scary. Don't try to pin this only on Sinclair

It's both https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNhUk5v3ohE
$C: That's sort of the problem with monopolies. You can't stop monopolies from forming without undermining business practices that are economically beneficial. 
$C: Sinclair is the one weaponizing the information in step with Russia.  They get no pass here, and they need to be broken up quickly.  Just because others can abuse the system doesn't mean I won't fixate on the one brainwashing Americans with Kremlin talking points.  As all of our intelligence has stated repeatedly, we are at war, and we are losing.  Sinclair is at war with America. 
$C: Yeah we've got such a GREAT deal watching our country continually slide to the right because of neoliberals like Clinton and Obama.  *So excited about it!*
$C: Eva Braun! Help me!
$C: "Eva Brauuun!"
$C: Literally.
$C: That's actually pretty poignant in the current year, where legitimate political opinions are dismissed outright without any debate as they are decried as fascist and hitlarian.  Want to support legal immigration and discourage illegal immigration?  Want to prevent non citizens from voting?  Think there might be an issue with letting people in the country who don't believe in equality of sexes or sexual preference?  Congratulations, you are literally Hitler.
$C: It’s a quote from something, I want to say it’s Futurama but I’m not 100% on that.

$C: I agree with what you're saying, but I think you're looking at what he wrote the wrong way. Everything that people hear about US politics can be fabricated, on both ends, to push any given agenda. It could be something to make Trump seem like the best president ever or it could be something to make Trump seem like he solves everything with a coin toss. The point I think he was trying to make, is that media has gone to the point of being able to push the same agenda effectively without much effort, as the vast majority of mass media is owned by a few companies, all with financial interests.
$C: You're a fucking idiot, man.
$C: This is all fine and dandy, but don’t let the fact that you agree with someone about one thing cloud the hateful shit they spew everywhere else.  Not saying that you do this specifically, but liberal Reddit loves to immediately warm up to otherwise detestable people as soon as they say something halfway reasonable.  It’s a bad habit.  Sure, remain impartial enough to judge a thought on its merits, but don’t be so empty-headed that the last thing you hear wipes out everything you’ve learned to that point.  Again, this is not even particularly aimed at you (I don’t know you).  Just ranting here.
$C: The dude is from The_Daddyissues. He's here because he thinks that this is the "Fake News" they're always on about.
$C: Check his edit. Still agree with him? Hm...
$C: There's something ironic that this exact situation (learning hidden truths about the reality of the world we live in) is exactly what "red pill" means and you're just knee jerk against it because you've been told it's a bad thing.

$C: It's not hopeless. We can vote for people who will break up these big media conglomerates, i.e. Comcast, Sinclair group, etc. The midterms are coming up in November. 


$C: >It's really fucking sad this is real life right now.

Agreed... this is not good at all.


$C: No. An episode of Black Mirror would have a lonely teenager whose only friend is his elderly wheelchair-bound mother beat said elderly mum to death with a  ballpeen hammer because a smartphone told him to do it. The scene would show her being brained in real time to a 90's song that's already been used in too many movies to mention. At the end the kids snaps out of the trance and smashes the evil smartphone, but it's too late. And somehow it all ends up being part of the business plan of some app developers. It's never questioned why a company would create a product with such potentially tragic side effects, not or is the idea that this foregone conclusion is BAD FOR BUSINESS, because all that really matters is pointing out that technology is evil and people are too stupid to know how to use it unless they're misanthropic television writers. 
$C: >Edit: real instead of realize. 

Realize. Real eyes. Real Lies.
$C: Propaganda being used to show "concern" for competing propaganda.  I'd watch that episode.
$C: Look the fact you're seeing something like this means we are better off than we were. We are making progress but it's a slow painful process.

Basic facts are being angrily pushed as incorrect and of course there's no such thing as correcting people on the internet.

We're doomed.
$C: really reminds me of the happy new year vid by them https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjNhW2mR1lM

$C: That's the scary part of Black Mirror. A lot of it is happening now, not in some distant future. 
$C: life always been like that. you really shouldnt be worrying about this, there is nothing you can do about it. just learn to enjoy life as it is
$C: We need to overturn Citizen’s United. These people can donate unlimited funds and “buy” our elections. We have to get the money out of politics.
$C: Even though I agree with you, this is a pipe dream. It looks good theoretically but they will eventually find the new guys price and it will be business as usual.

How many senators and congressmen have run on breaking up monopolies just for it to be forgotten after the are elected. Everyone has a price, it's just some are cheaper than others. 
$C: >We have to fight for our democracy by voting in the 2018 midterms in November!    
  
Bwa..haha...hahh.ha..ha.h.a.....*nobody* who could get on the ballot in November is gonna break up these conglomerates, they learned the lessons of the Bell System, they all make sure to donate and research candidates aplenty to make sure they've got enough influence to prevent it from happening again.   
$C: I agree with the goal, but the tools for a transparent and fair democracy has been hijacked. We need an overhaul of the system, and the solution comes in the form of new technology. I've been interested in the democracy.earth project as a potential solution.

$C: Editing wise, that is very difficult to do without shots that were planned for that ahead of time without it being very jarring or sounding like shit.
$C: I believe the daily show and John Oliver's show all do a very similar segment where they show different news stations side by side. 
$C: What shows they're not going at this yet is that the message is not fine-tuned to perfectly influence readers in different areas, this is just a clumsy copy and paste job.

In the future  this sort of content will be tailored to cities, quarters, and maybe individual sub-group to get the most effective reprogramming depending on the viewer's background context.

$C: Exactly. It was chilling
$C: [comply](https://youtu.be/MhZ_UygGnN0?t=7)
$C: That it's extremely dangerous to our democracy?
$C: Yep. Synching it all up, and then using their own words against them to hammer the point home multiple times at the end. Very well done video. 
$C: To be absolutely honest? The fact that the speech is scripted made it super easy— Pluraleyes is basically a one-click “sync this” app for editing together multi camera footage. 

But yes, it’s pretty disturbing that editing software built around identical audio recordings is all it takes to make a couple dozen news broadcasts harmonize like a fucking choir...
$C: this is very dangerous to our democracy... w e w. that freaking got me.
$C: fake news
$C: The hypocrisy of corporate media attacking fake news because they're guilty of manipulating public opinion themselves?

Why not do a video of the media manipulating public opinion themselves. Fake news is actually extremely dangerous to our democracy...
$C: It‘s not easy if it wasn’t shot with syncing in mind and if you have 50 different audio channels. 

It’s easy because the newscasters are all so synced up themselves.
$C: I have a feeling that they weren’t smiling or particularly happy about the whole thing.

It's about making money and the fact that spending more on proper journalism is just burning money, people rarely pay for it. Having worked for a long time in media it's incredibly depressing how little the quality of our content influences viewer/readership.

$C: The root problem here is the barriers government has put in place to starting your own news station or getting on local TV. The free market would provide us with competition. 

If you were given the choice of watching this or a local station owned/operated by local people what would you watch?
$C: I completely agree, I just don't think the general public cares enough. The next step should be showing the implications of this practice, and why people should be pissed off about it. 
$C: No, this example in particular isn't necessarily bad, but it demonstrates the powerful platform Sinclair Broadcasting has to push whatever agenda they choose.

This is a MUST RUN campaign that Sinclair mandates that their stations run.

Sinclair has an open, aggressive bias policy that involves running stories that are pro-GOP, regardless of the news of the day. 

This approach is unheard of in recent history for any local affiliate. 

This is very new and it is very bad. Sinclair is the first coordinated effort to openly inject specific bias into local broadcast news coverage - and it doesn't care about affiliation (FOX/ABC/NBC/CBS.) 

Local stations taking national reports from the wire (The AP, affiliate national services, etc) are taking existing reporting and editing it for time and relevance, not content or bias. 

What Sinclair is doing is NOT comparable to wire services. 
$C: I was just referring to this “fake news” PSA. Our station still has to run their packages and stories. I’m just pretty sure this PSA is over.

I seen my folly and will stop.
$C: What they're saying is true. Fake news is dangerous to 'our democracy'. But having monopolized media is also dangerous to democracy.

Fox News has little control over what fake news and sensationalist articles get published on social media. But they have full control over their news starions - as this video blatantly exposes. They care not because fake news is a danger to democracy, but because it's a danger to their establishment.

'Our democracy' is nothing but a sham and a joke. The media is heavily monopolised, elections are total bullshit and you're forced to choose between the two lesser evils. Politicians get blackmailed or bribed by giant companies who are immune to any sort of regulation
$C: Stations being forced to read a politically motivated script by their parent company is just fine and dandy with you?
$C: Chairman Pai has had a lot of very close conversations with Sinclair... 

*  On November 16, 2016, then-Commissioner Pai traveled to Baltimore, Maryland to have an off-the-record meeting with Sinclair employees and lunch with key company executives.This meeting was not disclosed publicly at the time.

* In December 2016, J ared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in law and current Senior White House Advisor, reported that the President’s campaign had “struck a deal” with Sinclair for better media coverage during the election

* On January 6, 2017, Commissioner Pai met privately with Sinclair representatives at the Consumer Electronics Show 1n Las Vegas.4 This meeting was also not initially publically disclosed.

* On January 16, 2017, Commissioner Pai traveled to New York City to meet privately with President-Elect Trump

* On January 19, 2017, Commissioner Pai traveled to Arlington, Virginia, to meet again with executives from Sinclair.6 A summary of the meeting, ﬁled in the FCC’s public docket, shows that the agency’s restrictions on joint or shared-service agreements were discussed in detail

* On January 22, 2017, President Trump elevated Commissioner Pai to be permanent Chairman of the FCC.

* On February 3, 2017, pursuant to unilateral direction from the now Chairman Pai, the FCC’s Media Bureau announced that it would no longer review joint sales agreements and shared- services agreements in broadcast mergers

* On February 23, 2017, the FCC started a proceeding to allow TV broadcasters to begin using Next Gen TV (also known as ATSC 3.0)—a technology for which Sinclair holds the key patents

* On March 6, 2017, Chairman Pai again met with President Trump. Chairman Pai, stated that he and the President did not discuss “any pending proceedings” at the FCC.

* On April 12, 2017, Chairman Pai led the FCC in a party line vote to ease ownership caps by reinstating the technologically-outdated UHF discount.ll Without this reversal, Sinclair would have been legally barred from merging with Tribune.

* On April 21, 2017, Sinclair announced its intention to purchase Bonten Media Group (Bonten), owner of 14 television stations in eight markets. Bonten also provided services to four other stations through joint sales agreements.

* On May 8, 2017 Sinclair announced its intention to acquire Tribune for $3.9 billion.

* On June 30, 2017, the FCC approved the purchase of seven Bonten stations by Sinclair (Sinclair divested the other seven stations). The transaction was later consummated by the parties on September 5, 2017, at which time Sinclair assumed the joint sales agreements held by Bonten.l4 If the FCC had not relaxed its review of joint sales agreements consistent with Sinclair’s request, it is unlikely this transaction would have been approved expeditiously without the termination of at least some of the joint sales agreements.

* On October 24, 2017, Chairman Pai led the FCC (on a party-line vote) in eliminating the broadcast main studio rule. Doing away with the rule, which was established in 1940, beneﬁts the largest broadcasters, especially Sinclair who has made a pattern of reducing local investments in station studios and consolidating studio and newsgathering operations at its headquarters in Maryland.”

* At the upcoming November 16, 2017 FCC Open Meeting, Chairman Pai is expected to lead FCC (on a partisan basis) to take two actions that will directly beneﬁt Sinclair.

* Chairman Pai is expected to lead the FCC’s party-line vote to eliminate decades-long rules that prevent TV stations in the same market from merging if the outcome leads to fewer than eight independent stations operating in that market, or if the merger is between two of the top four stations in a market.[6 This rule change directly beneﬁts the monopoly aspirations of Sinclair by eliminating the need for it to divest any of the stations it is purchasing from Tribune.'

* At the same meeting, Chairman Pai also is expected to lead the FCC (on a party-line vote) to approve broadcaster’s use of Next Gen TV. The item that Chairman Pai has put forth for vote would directly beneﬁt Sinclair. First, the draft order would establish a licensing framework for broadcasters that would allow Sinclair to establish and

>Your investigation should, at a minimum, examine the following questions:

>1. Whether the totality of the Chairman’s actions with regard to media ownership policies, media concentration policies, or the Sinclair- Tribune transaction, demonstrate actual impropriety, unscrupulous behavior, favoritism towards Sinclair, or a lack of impartiality?

>2. Whether the totality of the Chairman’ actions with regard to media ownership policies, media concentration policies, or the Sinclair-Tribune transaction demonstrate the appearance of impropriety, unscrupulous behavior, favoritism towards Sinclair, or a lack of impartiality?

>3. Whether the Chairman’s actions create the appearance or demonstrate the actual lack of independence of the FCC?

>4. Whether Chairman Pai’s actual impropriety, unscrupulous behavior, favoritism towards Sinclair, or a lack of impartiality requires that he recuse himself from all matters that would materially impact Sinclair or media ownership and media concentration matters?

>5. Whether the appearance of Chairman Pai’s impropriety, unscrupulous behavior, favoritism towards Sinclair, or a lack of impartiality requires that he recuse himself from all matters that would materially impact Sinclair or any media ownership and media concentration matters?

>6. Whether the FCC’s consideration of the Next Generation TV matters has been unduly inﬂuenced by the Chairman’s desire to boost the business interests of Sinclair? Please include in your answer whether the FCC’s examination of this matter has appropriately taken into account the competition and anti-trust issues raised by Sinclair’s role as the sole patent holder of key components of the Advanced Television Systems Committee 3.0 (ATSC 3.0) technology.

The draft order under consideration will not require Sinclair to offer, to other broadcasters, access to its patented ATSC 3.0 technology on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis. https://www.fcc.gov/document/next-generation-broadcast-television-standard.

$C: Yep, I also read they may need to sell off some stations to avoid antitrust issues and the plan is to sell to other conservative-friendly media companies.
$C: Did I read that right? That wasn't a typo? 70% 70 percent of all television viewers?!? That's ridiculous. How would that possibly be allowed to exist or even happen? Holy Zeus 
$C: If they think 42 years ago are old laws I got some words from 1776 they need to check out.
$C: And we're worried about the Russians.
$C: Excellent post! There was a time when a quality post like this would be at the top but now it's below several pun threads, comparisons to the Borg, and Metal Gears references.  
  
I console myself with the fact that while they are joking at least they are involved in the process (or at least being rubbed up against it). I have to believe that and that it's not just for the imaginary internet points to sleep at night.

$C: > Ajit Pai, said in a congressional hearing that the agency *would vote in November to roll back rules* that prevent ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station in the same market. 


I really hope that's just poorly phrased and what was meant was "will vote on a bill/motion/amendment etc. to roll back rules". It is rather worrying if they know the outcome beforehand. 

$C: Just kill me already 
$C: Well, that's horrific. 
$C: I'll concede one point to Pai in that hes right about how Facebook and Google are now so dominant in their roles that such standards applied to just newspapers and TV stations would seem unfair...

...Which logically should result in MORE regulation being applied to tech media companies too, not removing such regulations for everyone.
$C: please stop acting like it's a problem! 

Haven't you goddamn read PaiPai's comment? 

>media ownership rules were outdated. 

There you have it.  it's all good 
$C: GG USA
$C: The megaphone has been achieved. 
$C: Ha, a 42y law was outdated, but another one, over 200y old law, about the right to bear something is not outdated...
$C: 1) most of the people here are bitching not because of media consolidation, but because it's media consolidation to a conservative company.  they'd have no problem if it was going to a liberal company.

2) most of the US by land mass is conservative, even when you ignore gerrymandering.  look at an [electoral map](http://rynerohla.com/index.html/election-maps/2016-presidential-general-election-maps/).  it's more like a population distribution map.  so when they say 200 markets, it doesn't mean shit.  a single local station in NYC could have more viewership than all of them combined.
$C: Why are conservatives such assholes?
$C: Ugh. I tend towards conservatism. I think the current problem with the left is that it has a "megaphone." We don't need the pendulum to swing the other way. These people need to realize that they only need to make sure nobody's fingers are in the pie. While also keeping their own fingers out of the pie.

I despise this kind of shit. Looks like both sides will be responsible for 1984.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.

$C: [Did he help these stations back in 2013?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAkxR9T01pw)
$C: Hearing this shit about Ajit Pai, never before have I had such strong defenestration fantasies.

$C: The problem with this is that most people think their local station isn't being controlled by the megaphone like Fox.
$C: But they also own CBS, NBC, and ABC. They own both sides of the media.
$C: Wait so the company that owns a bunch of news networks is Republican? Because the news seems pretty liberal to me
$C: Welp, they've got that megaphone alright. 
$C: “Mr. Pai defended the plan and other deregulatory actions in recent months, saying media ownership rules were outdated.”

But his party’s platform is solely dependent on maintaining the constitution in its current format which is 229 years old... If we were to update every “outdated” piece of legislation we would:

1) have to take into consideration on where to begin

2) reeeeaaally delve into what works and what doesn’t, which I believe begins with finding a subject that merits that concentration

Not handing the keys to the majority of local news stations over to the few and fortunate...
$C: FYI: This is only possible because we elected a Republican as president. He is allowed to create a Republican-majority FCC and hat majority allows the Republican platform to get its way on communication policy.

This is what the Republicans want: a media system with no regulations where massive companies own everything and control the content of media. The Democrats want the opposite. 

By itself, this is a clear difference between Democrats and Republicans and a clear reason to vote for Democrats.

**Edit:** Wondering why I would get downvoted for a factual comment.
$C: Interesting. How does that compare to Oliver's parent company Time Warner's reach and ability to spread narratives?
$C: Thanks for the detailed reminder, we should never forget formal facilitators
$C: This strikes me as not unreasonable. I mean, apart from Fox all the major media companies just parrot the same liberal agenda. If we can't just have actual unbiased journalism, we can at least have it be roughly equal biased journalism. :\
$C: Good. Too much of a liberal bias in the media as is.
$C: Rothschild, Waltons, Clintons, at al.

Agreed.
$C: They don’t want to make a “conservative megaphone”. They are a somewhat republican family, but this is just a script they put out for all of them to read for a general announcement to their viewers. They don’t push a script for every segment all day long, but every now and then the company has a statement they want to get out and their form of announcing is via these individual broadcasts because if they just put out something like a commercial very few people would understand and a significantly smaller portion of their viewers would receive the message. Other than that they are a generally conservative family who push relatively conservative programs to a generally conservative viewership. They found a market and are selling to it the same as any other business.
$C: Dont try to paint this as conservatives doing it only; it does not matter which isle they lean towards
$C: Go away shill
$C: worth it at the end 
"this fuckin guy, or this fuckin logo, or this fuckin desk!"
$C: No one defends /r/politics but they were on top of this weeks before Oliver.
$C: Wait until you realize Oliver is part of the same corporate propaganda machine.
$C: John Oliver is no less dangerous than Sinclair.  He is one voice and definitely a biased one. 

Let's not pretend people listening to his opinions don't already agree with most of them. Just another echo chamber. 
$C: I’m sorry to hear that.  What do the reasonable people plan to do if/when the purchase goes through? Quit? Try to deal cause you can’t quit? Leak the propaganda to other stations in town to report on?
$C: Agreed.
$C: Yeah the Fox and CW stations here in Denver are both Tribune.  
$C: Yeah, very shitty.
$C: Maybe he was the one who got the post locked for a while?
$C: Oh that's hence the video? Because videos like this have come out before the FCC decision. This has happened for a long time. News stations record a satellite feed with a news story and get the script for it and run those stories later on in a newscast. That's nothing new. The significance of this is that there will be less local coverage. Entire news departments are being wiped out. This means people will be less informed about what is going on in their town. Politicians and businesses will be held less accountable, and its easier to spread agenda. The significance I'm talking about is an entire newscast no longer being relevant to the local market it's being aired in, not just a single news story being plucked from a feed to fill out a newscast. 
$C: Well yeah, local radio has been dead in the water for at least a decade. Used to be when you traveled, you'd actually hear different music as you got to different markets. Now it's just the same trash music. But it's the only way these FM stations even survive. I read somewhere that a used car salesman used to always keep track of what radio station the cars coming in were last set to so he'd know what channels to advertise on. This doesn't work anymore because the majority of cars he's seeing are set on aux or line in when cars come in. I myself just listen to podcasts and get the free month of SiriusXM monthly with a new e-mail address each time and plug into the aux.
$C: Clear Channel owns the local radio, Sinclair owns the local news stations, and Gannett owns the local newspapers.
$C: I heart radio, that company owns almost all my local radio stations
$C: This is why I support my local public radio station. If you're as creeped out by this video at I am, look into the public news outlets in your area and pick one to support (or donate to them all if you can).
$C: Clear Channel owns everything around here.  Anybody else starts up a radio station, Clear Channel complains to the FCC that their signal is messing with a station they own 150 miles away, and they run them in circles in the legal system until they're too broke to go on.
$C: Totaly different though. Modern radio is clumped into very specific and exclusive formats but, at least in my experience, steer clear of any kind of political agenda (talking about FM of course). So yes, there are large corporations with monopolies - which blows - but other than that there aren’t many similarities. If you’re talking about AM radio then disregard, I have no idea about that side of the business.
$C: Not. Yet.
$C: [Bane voice]
$C: I don’t think Hearst family broadcasting is going anywhere in my region. 
$C: Mods do a really good job here and help push progressive issues. This stayed up and they removed the toxic video portraying men as victims. Despite this arguably being a political video it remains up. I’m sure they were under a lot of pressure to remove it. 

Then look at the “muh poor man getting beaten up by a woman” that was brigaded by men’s rights activists. Mods removed it despite a ton of upvotes, and deleted all the toxic comments.

$C: >  likely owned by 1 of 5 other similar companies.

Absolutely NO OTHER group is as dangerous or insane as Sinclair. 

Hearst, LIN, Raycom...There's more than a dozen different groups and none of them operate like this. It may seem easy to attack them from a place of cynicism - and it actually HELPS Sinclair to ignorantly believe that "they're all the same anyway." 

They're not - and perceiving that plays right into Sinclair's motives. 

Source: I used to work for several, local, non-Sinclair stations/groups. 
$C: > edit: Independent Media is the way to go everyone

As long as people don't think independent means unbiased; other than that I have to agree that a smaller umbrella of editorial control is better.

We haven't exactly been acting like we want it though. We aren't fostering an ecosystem where there's profit  or even non-profit sustainability in independent media, small business, etc. Our laziness and greed is fostering Wal Mart, big media, etc.

We pirate, skip commercials, leave print media to die, and cut the cord. And worst of all perhaps is that we are our own news aggregators; re-broadcasting our desired news in our little biased online circles while we complain about media bias.

So I do lament the lack of independent media, but I'm not surprised that it's unsustainable.

edit: The flip side, of course, is that if we weren't still being "told" what we like to consume, we wouldn't be looking elsewhere. Print, radio, and traditional television have not adapted.
$C: Sinclair (Soon with Tribune), Raycom, Hearst, Meredith, Gray, Nexstar, Tegna, Scripps, Cox.

That covers a substantial number of local TV stations. The biggest markets are mostly owned and operated by the networks.
$C: All mine seem actually be owned by the actual FOX, NBCUniversal, Disney, and CBS Corporations. Not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
$C: Seattle's about to have 2 stations owned by them (KOMO and Q13 FOX)

:L
$C: Mine are owned all by their actual parent company (NBCUniversal, Disney, 20th Century Fox, & CBS Corporation) not really sure if that's a good or bad thing. But I'm at least happy they're not all owned by one company like it seems many of these cities have. I remember watching Hurricane Irma coverage and the NBC and ABC stations combined down in Florida and had both sets of anchors and reporters working on the same channel. That would've never happened in my market, those stations are mortal enemies. Guess it makes more sense now since the same company owned both of those stations and just combined them since they were doing 24-hour coverage.
$C: They're all owned by their actual corp (Disney, NBCUniversal, 20th Century Fox, and CBS Corp) I live in a big market so it seems they actually hold onto their stations when they have big markets (big markets = $$$ in ads)
$C: All my stations are owned by NBCUniversal, Disney, CBS Corp, & 20th Century Fox and hav been since they were founded in the 1930s, doubt it. True for many but not all.
$C: Nope, looked up the owner for each, I live in Philadelphia, WTXF, WPVI, WCAU, KYW, if you feel like looking them up yourself.
$C: I'd say the smaller the market, the more likely.
$C: Nope, not on that list either. I'm in a big market where all the stations are owned by their parent company (NBCUniversal, Disney, CBS Corp, and 20th Century Fox)
$C: It's all fine now, it shows up on "hot" and "top".
$C: Japan is currently considering its own version of the TA of 1996. 
$C: good old Slick Willie
$C: I don't know why you are getting downvoted. Sinclair themselves admit that the 'Telecommunications Act of 1996' is what helped them grow.

> The passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was one of the industry’s biggest catalysts for change, providing for some deregulation and allowing the Company to make acquisitions. Within 10 years after being formed, Sinclair became the nation’s largest commercial television broadcasting company not owned by a network when it acquired River City Broadcasting.

$C: Cut funding, yes, but I really doubt they can just shut them down. They are private NPOs that were created by the government...they can continue running without government funding. NPR and PBS receive the majority of their funds from private entities...even if they did cut the funds, democrats would eventually regain power and reverse the defunding policies.
$C: Luckily I think most of their funding comes from viewer contributions. I have an old beat up car that Im gonna donate to NPR instead of dealing with craigslist crazies haha

Big corporations can run media and manipulate our thoughts and understanding. This is going on in Canada right now where telecommunications giant Bell has been trying to pass legislation on censoring the Internet. 

The big thing r/Canada has found out from awareness groups trying to advocate on this issue is that they have not been able to do any media advertisements on the issue because Bell either runs and owns every radio and tv station and just has so much power that the awareness groups are pretty much blacklisted from traditional media advertisements and are thus silenced

I must have caught it at just the right moment. Now we just wait for someone to repost this for karma
$C: And also extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: What's worse is that the only reason you are seeing it on Reddit *at all* is that:

A)    It's Saturday evening, so the mods are not paying attention.  

B)    The sub is /r/videos, which seems less safeguarded than more news-oriented subs. 

Reddit used to have such "subversive" content pop up regularly -- at least once a day or so, until they got better and better at squashing it.  

Reddit the company really only wants you to look at mildly amusing and generally irrelevant memes or fake Tinder conversations.

$C: Is it really though? 1984 deals with a totalitarian state. This is a private organization.
$C: You have been asked to report to the ministry of love.  Compliance is mandatory. 
$C: You're a thought criminal!
$C: Relax, it's just real life. 
$C: It freaking starts with the station I watch out of San Antonio. I knew it was going to be creepy, but that alone was just... awful. I knew they were Sinclair stations already, and I knew when I saw that segment on-air that it was force-fed crap, but damn.
$C: Don't worry, the admins just had to A/B this post.

It's now only visible to the users identified through data of whom will not make actionable moves on this.

We've been filtered. 
$C: .
$C: Not that Orwellian at all, really. Though still not good.
$C: You say Orwelian, I say American. From an outside perspective Americans always seemed complacent. When they see the blood that gets shed for freedom in other countries I don't think they genuinely understand it. This is not in any way a personal attack on you, just a comment 
$C: Fuck it, I'll bite.  Can someone explain to me why this is so bad?  Of course a media conglomerate would want to run a story on all of the channels it runs.
$C: Well we had the guy who fucked the pig, but at least we have properly regulated media.


Sincerely,

$C: You can definitely imagine the pig there..
$C: So the best part 😏
$C: Yeah, where's the rest of the episode?
$C: Best episode. Ever.
$C: No offense, it's a good show, but it does have a whiff of [The Simpsons did it](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsBeenDone) at times. 

As in, quite a few episodes are extended versions and modernizations of other peoples work. Like twilight zone, poe, king, orwell, etc. 

Several of the episodes are basically tributes to things like [Animal Farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm), [The Masque of the Red Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Masque_of_the_Red_Death), [The Scarlet Letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scarlet_Letter) and many more. 

And again, they are good interpertations, but I'm just tired of people calling it original.
$C: Only a Sinclar deals in absolutes. 
$C: A big dumb puppet dinosaur, in other words.
$C: Yeah Sinclair broadcasting, news corp, and a handful of other companies are buying up all the media outlets.  It is becoming a monopoly on controlling voices.
$C: The new hip Orwelian for the younger generation.
$C: [deleted]
$C: The best way to do that is to vote. Vote for people who want to rein-in monopolies. This is caused by a private-owned media conglomerate under the control of one family. 

There are several such Robber-Baron families in 2018 - the Sinclairs, the Mercers, the Kochs, and the Adelsons, to name a few.  We need new Anti-Trust legislation. 

Vote in the 2018 midterms this November. 
$C: Well, no, Orwell was too busy worrying about power concentrated in the hands of a central state, he completely whiffed on the problem of checks and guarantees against the state's power being completely unprotective against abuse by private entities.

Edit: Locked and removed. Cool fuckin beans, mods. Cool fuckin beans.
$C: And people think it’s a good idea to encroach further on gun rights. 
$C: There are certain tools that are expressly useful for this end. 
$C: You need the second amendment to protect the first. Speak truth to power 
$C: You are so right. We should all be furious that a former Supreme Court Justice is encouraging a movement to repeal our 2nd Ammendment rights.
$C: You sir serious_  beans, are most definitely dangerous to our democracy 
$C: What rights? What the hell does a local news company from Iowa have to do with your rights? Lol
$C: Big newspapers in the US had a monopoly and it kept the peons (99%) under control during the 'Gilded Age' of the powerful industrialists. After the Great Depression, part of the laws passed to prevent another one were anti-trust laws- included media. Reagan killed one (Cable Communications Act) and Clinton killed the other (Fairness in media). 
$C: Except the right to bear arms. You are a child murderer if you think people should have semi automatic rifles. 
$C: No, a lot of local news stations having the same script isn't the beginning of a totalitarian state, stop being stupid.

"It's time we start defending our rights"? Against who? Jesus christ.
$C: Man thems some serious beans alright

$C: U should see r/politics, same deal with the Orwellian hive mind
$C: We can rein these fuckers in by voting in the 2018 midterms this November! Vote for people who support antitrust legislation!
$C: This has been a growing, festering problem long before Trump was even on the scene, shut the fuck up.
$C: Just because they are trying to monopolize a dying industry doesn't mean you should be scared. Do what any sane person would do when they get told nonsensical lies, ignore it! Then they will have wasted their money. 
$C:  not 'like'.
100% authentic propaganda in action. 

$C: You don't feel it's apt in this example?
$C: There is a problem.

Regulation is enacted to fix the problem.

The problem goes away.

People ask why we need the regulation because there is no problem.

Regulation is repealed.

There is a problem...
$C: I swear they are going to deregulate us back into the next recession. They don't give a fuck about consumers.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: I'm really curious, can you source this? 
$C: The newspaper is a dying business, though. Newspaper companies are being forced to change their business models to survive in today's society.
$C: Reagan killed one (Cable Communications Act) and Clinton killed the other (Fairness in Media).


$C: This is extremely dangerous for our democracy.
$C: That sounds extremely dangerous for your democracy.
$C: This is extremely dangerous, to our democracy.
$C: There also used to be more restrictions on the number of stations one could own as well- as well as how many in a single market. 

We need those back. 
$C: Rush Limbaugh has been playing these types of mash ups for 20 plus years. And it isn’t local news shows. It is the pretorian guard that is mainstream media. All together saying tithe exact same thing word for word. 
$C: Thanks, Ajit Pai. 
$C: So, I learned this a while back, but if you know the measurements/numbers for your glasses prescription, you can get them relatively cheap through https://www.zennioptical.com/

If you need prescription glasses, I strongly recommend at least checking them out. At worst, you lose 30-50$ on a pair of glasses.
$C: good to know SPY is independent. I'll buy my next pair from them
$C: IIRC, debeers only has like 30% of the market nowadays?
$C: Local news isn't fox news, even if they share the name fox.
$C: Which is very dangerous to our democracy
$C: I get all my news from YouTube comment sections and r/adviceanimals
$C: If you're the type of person who takes a Facebook newsfeed at face value, then no. 

But the internet is absolutely a better source of news than television, if for no other reason than you can dig in and fact-check, look up sources and investigate further. 

For example, television news will use phrases like "According to a recent study..." and then continue on. With the internet, I can find who commissioned that study. 
$C: The last bastion of news with any real integrity is, kind of ironically, NPR. They’re only about 5% subsidized by the government, and get around 80% of their operating money from individual listener donations. I think they do an extremely good job of objective reporting everywhere from the local to national level.
$C: ^some Internet news is better. ^some Print news is better.
$C: If you avoid TV news, you can get pretty good sources. 

If you want straight news, just go to a wire service (Reuters is my favourite, but you can also check out AP or Bloomberg). 

If you want well-researched journalism with an excellent ethical standard, and you don't mind an editorial leaning, go for the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, or Washington Post in the USA or the Economist or the BBC in the UK. There are many other reputable publications in other countries and languages. There are also many great publications for field-specific news (e.g. technology). 

TV news is much harder because, even when their fact-checking is excellent, the editorial leaning can be much stronger. 24-hour news services (e.g. CNN) have to choose what their top stories are and they play those on repeat, necessarily giving a distorted view of what is happening in the world at any given time.This means that Fox News, CNN, NPR, and MSNBC viewers will have very different views on the news of the day, even if you account for factual errors. 
$C: He wants his circle jerks to come from reddit only. 

$C: Whose to say where the "best news" is in these times of fake news. I think one could say though it's best to diversify your news content and the internet obviously is best for that
$C: Look for news that isn't trying to sell ads.  BBC.  NPR.
$C: NPR is better...
$C: i'd answer yes to internet news. there's more of it, and a lot of it is garbage, but if you have a good sense of what's credible then a sizable amount of it is much better than TV news.
$C: > internet news

Uhhh, yes. It is...you can access the website for literally any single reputable news organization on the internet. If you can't find good news on the internet, then it doesn't exist.
$C: thats episode from the new season of the x files says it perfectly. basically, the government doesn’t even need to safeguard secrets anymore. people can simply call it fake news. 
$C: Watch Anchorman 2 again... it is all ‘bad’ sensationalized news. That movie, while funny, really helped highlight the changes from ‘real’ news to just worrying about ratings and literally only reporting on the ‘terrible’ things that kept people watching. 
$C: That seems like a baseless and unnecessarily bleak assumption of the future. There are plenty of good media institutions still around, just because they may have to adapt their mediums doesn't mean they're going to die.
$C: That's the other edge of propaganda.

Either you're fooled into buying what they're selling or you're overwhelmed, exhausted, and eventually just give up.

How many times can you try and explain "no, what *actually* happened was..." to unreceptive people before you just call it quits?
$C: Not necessarily, my trust of the news has not changed. One should still seek out opposing viewpoints, expect sources and fact checks, and realize you are fallible. If people were previously assuming truth was coming out of the advertising machine then of course they are probably surprised now. 

That said, this is a new phenomenon, where a single (biased) company has purchased as many local news providers as possible in order to sow doubt and spread propaganda. 
$C: A lot of philosophers are arguing, and I tend to agree, that we are genuinely in the “post-truth” era.
$C: As long as you ignore the politics in the UK reported on BBC which is completely biased against the labour party and Jeremy  Corbyn they are not too bad with there news from around the world. But to me the best is the radio news on local stations no need for them to spew out lies and spin stories just a quick highlight of the top headlines.
Then i come to the comments section of most of the big stories and it is rather easy to see those that hype up the news but also those that are being more factual.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Good. TV news like this doesn't deserve our trust. It's been used as propaganda and social conditioning since the inception of television.
$C: There's actually empirical literature on social trust.  I wonder what it says.
$C: no, we just don't trust the sources with which we disagree.
$C: That’s not true at all. 
$C: This propaganda has two win conditions; either make people trust no news but theirs, or make people trust no news period.

If you can make people trust no news but your own, you can control most of their world view. If you can stop a person from trusting any news, it is easier to get away with horrible things because those people don't know who to ever listen to, making it difficult to ever rally over a cause.
$C: News is the middle man. Now we can hear from the very people involved, and ask them questions directly. 
$C: I guess it's too much to ask for another Edward R Murrow or Walter Cronkite isn't it?

I find it an almost daily urge at this point to apologize to my son for bringing him into this shitty, shitty society that we have created … It is my dream that his generation might possibly be willing and able to fix some of this nightmare
$C: https://i.imgur.com/zLgqRoN.jpg
$C: That's even more insane, because whether you like it or not, there is truth out there and just giving up on everything is the easiest thing you can do. 
$C: There are some bad actors in media but most of the damage has been an intentional undermining of the trust in media for partisan advantage (similar efforts have been launched against the courts, law enforcement and intelligence services.)
$C: Too true. I’ve lost trust in all reporters
$C: The problem is that Sinclair owns lots of local news...
$C: [deleted]
$C: Local news needs to focus on what's going on in your town. A multinational conglomerate's interests completely conflict with that idea
$C: I have to disagree. TV news in general is a cancer. It's morphed from a requirement of accuracy to open speculation and telling people how to feel, which is clearly no longer reporting or "news". It a dinosaur that will disappear like the cassette and VHS. It's already starting to feel the pinch.  

Source: Worked in local news for 15 years. 
$C: "just sinclair" ok buddy
$C: This isn't staying informed, this is being misinformed and manipulated by Murdoch and Co. if something big happens, you'll hear about it no matter what. 
$C: Trust busters are unfortunately rare in this continued era of "everything that doesn't benefit billionaires is communist" 
$C: But both parties are the same, and turd sandwich and giant douche, and the lesser of both evils is still evil and my single issue vote! 
$C: Oh u right, even better
$C: "As a totally real liberal I think that both sides are just the same. Just look at this well made video proving democratic propaganda!"

OH, right. You don't actually have any evidence. Of course.
$C: Found the guy who falls for fake news.
$C: And yet you can't say anything to discredit it except to call me an idiot.
$C: In the case of this video, he's right.  Sinclair Broadcasting is a right-wing company.
$C: >postmodernist

Lol go back to watching Kermit the Frog cry about IQ tests
$C: No, Sinclair is very openly conservative and is essentially trump propaganda 
$C: Sinclair broadcasting and fox news are 100% anti-American , anti-science , anti-middle and working class republican propaganda.

There is nothing left-wing that even comes close to matching this bullshit.
$C: It'd be super easy for you to show me evidence that left wing groups are doing the same thing as this.

Well, it's not easy. Since it doesn't exist. But if it did, you could get off your lazy ass and find it.
$C: Well I can't imagine it happening in this exact form anywhere else other than done corrupt authoritarian hell hole and America
$C: Sinclair has a MAJOR conservative bent, so no, not really.

$C: There's still a huge amount of talent going in to producing current songs, it's just you don't see the writers face anymore
$C: [De La is alive and well and as angry as ever.](https://youtu.be/PkGwI7nGehA)
$C: I guess we could spend all day trying to agree on when to draw the line, when it all started falling apart. A lot of people say it started with Reagan, but then you'll have people who say it's earlier. What we can all agree on is things are going downhill.
$C: I saved the video, just so I can show people I know who still trust the news.
$C: Gone again.
$C: r/videos has rules about no political videos, which was a blessing during the US election. I can see them going back and forth on that as Sinclair is clearly biased. 

Then the vote count and the video going down is standard Reddit. 
$C: Just an update...
Still top on my front page.
$C: They brought it down for the general public.

Those users who they identify who will not act on this are the ones who can see it. A/B filtering. 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: They will came up with some bullshit excuse like people upvoting with bots or some other shit. 
$C: "They"
$C: That might just be the Reddit algorithm if it wasn't on your home page but was on r/videos at the time. If you have seen content already it'll take it out of your homepage next time you view. 
$C: At the end of the day, there is no red or blue, only the ones in control. 
$C: If reddit was left leaning (or ran by someone with a brain), Steve Huffman wouldn't think literal white supremacists deserved a voice. He would remove T_D and not a video like this. 
/r/valuablediscourse

He wouldn't threaten /r/stopadvertising with a bullshit excuse that they refuse to provide any evidence for.

Reddit in the end is about money.
$C: More reddit users are liberal (as are most young people & internet users in general), but the CEO is a far-right Trump supporting libertarian goof named Steve Huffman.
$C: I thought it was a joke.
$C: [removed]
$C: These *pretzels* are making me thirsty. 
$C: Not really. The oligarchs know the loud folks on social media are mostly slacktavists. 
$C: Impressive tantrum lad 10/10
$C: Thanks for pointing this out.

Somehow they think painting all trump supporters as the devil incarnate is a good or reasonable approach. Then they wonder why these people double down.
$C: Preach 🙌🏼
$C: Anytime I deal with the left and disagree they become jerks,  instead of actually try to find a middle ground they just act holier than thou,  every time I've mentioned I wouldn't want to be on their side or stand next to them because of their attitude im met with "we don't want you anyway" type arguments.   
  
See how quickly your party dissappears with that attitude. Good on you for recognizing the important bit. Be welcoming. 
$C: Nope.
You people will make your useless comments here and 5 minutes later you'll be commenting on something else and will have forgotten about it later on tonight you'll probably be playing video game the world will go on
$C: Only if we actually go out and do something about it, instead of just assuming someone else will.  
$C: Oligarchs ibpn power really want to stay

This is Sinclair broadcast, alt neo Nazis propaganda
$C: > Get the hell out of my messages. I'm done with Reddit for the day.

Probably best to delete your comment than throw a fit m8.
$C: Yea, when you say shit like that, it sounds like you're a Neo Nazi and you support Sinclarian broadcasting Propaganda.

Trump _is_ the oligarchy
$C: Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic. And _extremely dangerous to our_ ***democracy!***
$C: Does it?

Because look at the comments... Most people are replying to the few serious top comments all trying to be the one to make a joke and start a gold train.

I'd argue that WW2 only got to the point it got to because the world didn't take Hitler seriously.

Of course I'm not saying you shouldn't joke about something. I'm saying what do you do after no one knows how to move on from just uncomfortably joking about it? Waiting for someone else to take action, or take it for what it really is at face value.

Not to mention we've had a whole technology and media revolution since then, so much about societal attitudes has changed. I don't think we can rely on past human behaviour as an accurate measurement for what people will do today.
$C: > He's just a scapegoat.

He's a lackey. He does their work. He earns all the blame he receives. His bosses earn even more.
$C: Oh I’m not saying he’s the mastermind at all. We’re on the same page friendo. 
$C: Because the news is just soooooooo conservative, right?
$C: Trending is regional, it has been kept off US trending while allowed to trend in other countries. It is still not anywhere on US trending, you know - where the videos are actually from. 
$C: This needs to be higher, you wana be a hero? Blow some whistles 
$C: Do an anonymous AMA with a throwaway account, please. Tomorrow afternoon would be a perfect time.
$C: Oh wow. I wonder why people were unaware of this.
$C: While I understand the sentiment I really hope you're looking for a change of employers so you can jump ship ASAP otherwise it sort of rings hollow.

I mean, if the job description was honest and included "disseminating Sinclair-written propaganda" you would probably only pick that job as a last resort to keep yourself afloat, right? I understand that there are bills to pay but I think your acknowledgement that this is wrong and whatever part you play in being a piece of this machine means you should take responsibility and at the very least do whatever you can to deprive Sinclair and the propaganda monster of your skills and talents.
$C: Lol, comment was removed
$C: Yeah, filtered by mods you dumb fuck, its how reddit works, way to solve the enigma code
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.


$C: The frogs arent gay, they're asexual.
$C: It's funny when people call Alex Jones the leading source of propaganda. Do people really think that a literal raving lunatic is the epitome of American propaganda? Most people don't want to come to terms that it's already right in front of our noses.
$C: Only Russia and North Korea push propaganda. Least that's what the TV told me.
$C: One of the greatest propaganda victories of the 21st century is corporations convincing people that only the government can make propaganda.
$C: >The frogs are not gay

At least until they started putting chemicals in the water supply.  It's makin' the frickin' frogs gay!
$C: George W. Bush is good now. Drink more Coca-Cola. America is free. Don't think about the future.

*Bounced on my boy's dick to this...*
$C: [Operation Mockingbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird) is a famous historical example.

$C: yet
$C: yeah, but male swans could be!
$C: This is Sinclair Broadcasting, a corporation that admits to being biased and attempting to manipulate viewers, not "America". This is aimed at Americans by a private corporation.

"Hey, Isn't all of China's propaganda over the top and obvious?"  

He Responded:  

"Yeah we all know it is happening, But this US Propaganda is so much more obvious."  

Or something like that. I know I got it mostly wrong, but the basics are there.
$C: The president invites you to Mar-a-Laogai. 
$C: A + B and a lil of C 
$C: "Fake news" in this context is anything critical of Trump 
$C: yes, because only one side propagandizes, and it's the one you're not on.
$C: Don't be dumb, and actually blame the real culprit: corporatism. 
$C: we all know leftists are nazis. whats new? 
$C: Maybe off topic but I loved the game Horizon Zero Dawn, reading all the things about the past (our future). Governments are replaced by sovereign corporations and private corporate militia. Capitalism and automation goes, well, as you would expect.
$C: More importantly, it makes people think that the side making the propaganda is the right side to be on.
$C: this is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: I've been telling people that for a decade! But everyone wanted to brush me off just because I supported left wing policy, and wanted to pretend I was some SJW Tumblrite anytime I tried defending the label left.

God help me of I ever tried telling other people that sjw's aren't left wing; they believe the entire system is male dominated, left right, centre; doesn't matter a lot of them refuse to associate with any of the current parties.

But don't let the truth get in the way, oh no the right can just keep parroting whatever crap they like, and you know what, before 2-3 years go everyone is eating it up. They have funnier memes,  their way of argueing making someone looked "rekt" was a guilty pleasure to too many people.


Now they have the confidence and arrogance to just keep on saying shit no matter how much you call it out.

I blame people for immortalising the right.
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: And now we are talking about the joke rather than the core issue with the video content! Successfully distracted!
$C: It’s like watching the video in text form. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Because the left and right are the fucking same :)
$C: The local affiliates are not really linked to the parent network at all, especially when it comes to their editorial/opinion content.

The national CBS/ABC organization have next to nothing to do with the content run during the 11 o'clock news hour on your local station.

However, most of those local channels are owned by the same media conglomerate, the  Sinclair Broadcast Group.  In some cities, the ABC and CBS affiliates (or NBC, or Fox) might both be owned by Sinclair.

Sinclair *is* right wing.  Sharply so.  And it forces local stations to run particular bits of scripted opinion content, making it seem as though the presented opinions come from the local station and thus giving them greater local credibility.
$C: Since Sinclair purchased them. Yes, this is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: They're local affiliates, it doesn't work that way. This is why it is so dangerous
$C: > Since when?

Since Sinclair bought them
$C: Don't be dumb. These are clearly local affiliates owned by Sinclair. Try to keep up.
$C: All the stations shown might be CBS or ABC or NBC or whatever affiliates, but they're owned by [Sinclair Broadcast Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_Broadcast_Group).  Sinclair often uses the local news on their stations to put out right wing propaganda; like hundreds of mini-Fox News stations around the country.

This^is^extremely^dangerous^to^our^democracy
$C: Since they were purchased by Sinclair 
$C: Sinclair is super right wing 
$C: They’re not. But being anti-right wing is a great way to get upvotes on Reddit.
$C: They are corporations feeding you news of course they are right-wing what else could they possibly be?
$C: If you believe that you haven't been paying attention.
$C: > lol

lol
$C: ...idk if you’re just in the dark about all of this, but Sinclair is definitely right wing

$C: I don't see the left calling everyone they disagree with a Nazi. Except those neo-Nazi that are supposedly good people according to trump. Because, well, it's in their name...
$C: Sinclair scripts it’s tv stations to spread right wing, anti-liberal propaganda 

It absolutely is right wing, they proudly call themselves right wing
$C: What is the context of the video?  Are you even aware of what Sinclair is doing?
$C: And heres's the 2nd best play from the same handbook. Claim both sides are the same when caught.
$C: Both sides are Nazis!
$C: Wrong, CNN is not misrepresenting itself as being a local community broadcast. CNN, you know you are getting the same message from the people. 

While Sin Clear is using local people to broadcast the appearance that news coverage is local. It would be much cheaper and more honest  if they just broadcast with one national team. However, the people that consume sinclear would not be as trusting because “insert derogatory geographical label” would be communicating the news to the them.
$C: A right wing company, Sinclair, bought these stations and is forcing the local anchors to read the same scripts on air, all of which have a right wing tilt
$C: Sinclair is openly pro-trump and right wing. 
$C: Eh. You know, 100% of deaths are from breathing
$C: Wow those are some great numbers man, did you make them all by yourself?
$C: Your comment is flat out wrong.

Reagan's FCC voted to revoke the fairness doctrine in 1987. Not sure how Bill Clinton fits into this?

$C: no, republicans do it
$C: **Yes**, *no*, and maybe.


$C: There is no evidence that Bob saget raped and killed a girl. I repeat no evidence. 
$C: It had to be believable, and allow people consuming it to believe they have come to their own conclusion.  The McCain's had adopted a Bangladeshi girl.  The base saw his daughter and could themselves decide that brown=illegitimate.  Rove could then say it's not his fault that voters came to their own conclusions, he just posed a hypothetical.  
  
We'll see this again with the USPS and Amazon. Amazon pays huge amounts of money to Amazon under their service contract.  All the base has to do is hear the messaging that Amazon pays nothing, look at their order and see free shipping, and then decide for themselves that Amazon is ripping off the USPS.
$C: Remember how Rove accused John Kerry, a man with multiple purple hearts, of being a coward in the Vietnam War and not really earning those medals? Meanwhile George W. Bush used his connections to spend the war in Texas fucking governor's daughters and getting hammered at debutante balls.
$C: It’s weird that y’all think I was implying that. I was merely bringing up the most recent example.
$C: Care to spell it out? I guess it's not worded very well, but I've re-read my post a couple of times and I don't really understand why it's getting these responses.
$C: Illuminati confirmed.

$C: My favorite doc of all time. Highly recommended.
$C: On part 2, so far my dude it looks like you found a wonderful piece of propaganda about propaganda. First red flag, the BBC aired this... 2nd red flag, the narrator keeps INSISTING that America is a democracy. It is not, at least, it was never meant to be. It was intended to be a constitutional republic. 

This is a great film at demoralizing people. I see nothing more, i also notice a distinct lack of pointing out the Zionist problem and an obsession with Nazism and other isms. Most shockingly though, is the way they appear to be slamming open markets.

Paging /u/spez.

I know he's got those disabled, but you never know when he might search his name on the thread or something.
$C: Local news anchors aren't really journalists. The local stations around me always just hire young girls right out of college. They're all in their 20s and have never done a day of reporting. 
$C: Some act like they know something they have no knowledge of.

EDIT: Referring to OP saying anchors are essentially actors, not anchors.
$C: I actually know a guy that did just this for 17 years but once his station was bought by Sinclair he became the executive director of a popular theatre in town so...
$C: That is what they become though. 
$C: anchorman actually touches on how similar other cities news teams are
$C: I believe it. The news anchor I know is my best friend's younger sister, so I've known her since she was a toddler. She's a sweet person with a pretty face, but she's not a journalist in the least. She might have a journalism degree, I'm not even sure, but only because her dream job was working for TMZ and dishing dirt on popstar celebrities she followed like a cult member. I've watched some of her stuff on youtube and she's just as good as any of them, I'm not knocking her for being bad at her job--she's just *not* an investigative journalist and not someone whose opinion I would ever value on political or important social topics. 
$C: My attitude is something along the lines of "use only as much government as is absolutely necessary".

This is absolutely necessary.

I wouldn't call my views libertarian, but I acknowledge that it isn't good to have the government interfering unless there's a really good reason.
$C: I know we all make snide comments, but this kinda attitude towards libertarians isn't doing anyone any favors. Libertarianism is a broad paintbrush and most decent folks just wanna see the market to be free (as possible) while having as few regulations as needed. I know our duopoly makes these issues incredibly devisive and unfair for everyone, but I'd rather find common ground with a free-marketer than a trump cultist. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: I think some people assume each news stations is its own little 'business' essentially, where everyone is involved in the journalistic aspects of news in some way and don't realize just how much of a well-oiled machine it is.  Most people probably just don't really think about it I guess.  
$C: The only problem is that the pesky 1st amendment of the Bill of Rights kinda sorta prevents anyone from passing that sort of law...
$C: I'm saying it in the context of, society as a whole. We have a very short attention span. One moment we care about this matter. Next week or a month from now we'll all be up in arms about the next issue. 

I don't have any say on what people should care about. 

One way or another. We will watch the next big news story on one of those local stations.

$C: I'm reading that book right now, 100 pages in. Scary stuff. 
$C: But these are just big capitalists, are you implying they are all banding together into a covert supergroup? There is most certainly a narrative that changes through the eras, but how does this work?  
Otherwise, how does one big capitalist with many media channels in his pocket achieve control by trying to shape public opinion?   

(It only makes sense if he shapes public opinion for people to vote the people he himself is lobbying for and which in turn help him keep/attain power)
$C: Until they just cross their arms and pout because “well I’m entitled to my own opinion” and someone told them something truthful they just plan didn’t want to hear. Aw shucks
$C: Fuck you you're wrong

See, stuff like that is important to have, even though it's one of the main points some try to use against social media
$C: I just hid the video in an email titled "this is extremely dangerous to our democracy" to my right-wing conservative grandfather. -snicker- double-meaning in that one.
$C: There was a pretty good John Oliver segment on it if you want some more info. 
$C: There is network programming and local programming.  Network programming is basically the primetime programming and for everybody but Fox a national morning news show.  Local stations are required to play a certain portion of network programming, but are responsible for producing or finding programming for certain time blocks, including the local news broadcasts. The networks have nothing to do with the production of news broadcasts like these beyond providing optional reporting segments.

Sinclair and other media companies can and do own stations from different networks.
$C: Basically they are affiliated to those large networks, who have nominal ownership, but are licensed out and operated by other companies, like Sinclair.
$C: It's sort of like how one person can own a whole bunch of NFL teams, but they're still part of the NFL.
$C: Yep, because "regulation is bad for the free market", or something.
$C: Just facts
$C: Swing and a mile-away miss on the contextual relevance there, buddy.
$C: Nah
$C: Not—entirely—how that works but okay. 
$C: or fund it publicly 
$C: Nothing so fancy.  Just your regular rwnj.
$C: I didn't link to a thread but to a specific post. One which is factually accurate. You don't do yourself a favor by simply disregarding it for the post's origin.
$C: Your democratic republic is futile
$C: oh, they unlocked and unremoved it
$C: That’s my new response to everything.
$C: I thought it was funny that even though they were all saying the same thing, they all had to out their own inflection on it. That reminded me of how purposeful performers are (and these “reporters” are performers) ... and that, along with the repetition, reminded me of Kramer. That’s the only connection.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death
$C: That's an interesting one, not really as close to 1984 as people say though. 1984 is very bleak, Brave New World keeps a pretty happy tone throughout, even though the subject matter can be a little disturbing.
$C: I heard that Fahrenheit 451 was a bit too preachy would you say this is true? 
$C: It's really groan inducing and cringey.

In every single thread about some policy even *slightly* pro-business you'll inevitably find the 19 year olds backpatting someone for having the insight to regurgitate the "war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength" quote.

And the top reply is some equally absurd hand-wringing crap like "it's terrifying how relevant this is..  how do we stop this from becoming our future?"

Then a bit below that is the "we've always been at war with Eastasia" quote, and at the *very* bottom, buried in downvotes is the guy who is trying to explain why it's ridiculous to apply 1984 quotes about societal brainwashing to an AP story about congressional budget talks.
$C: Gorka is a Nazi political operative and international criminal. 
$C: ....you're not meant to take it literally. What's happening here is full-blown manipulation, very akin to what the ministry of truth does in 1984
$C: Because it wasn’t, they just had the media they controlled say it is
$C: But he accepted his transparency award behind closed doors remember? It was really transparent. 
$C: Wait.

So Obama had mass media singing his praises and saying he had the most transparent administration.  Even when he was droning civilians, the media praised him, and everyone agreed.

Trump comes along bashing MSM and saying they're fake news - EXACTLY WHAT THIS VIDEO SHOWS - and everyone listens to the media and believes he's evil.

It's time to wake up.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Trump calls the liberal stations the mass media. Right wing groups like Sinclair and Fox are not included in the mass media. 
$C: No, because this isn’t the mass media.

These are local stations controlled by Sinclair 
$C: It also owned by a group that is pro-Trump and has all of its stations air segments with a former member of the Trump campaign. 
$C: How you are unable to read the second part of his sentence is beyond me. /u/goeasyonmitch quite literally says:

$C: Why would you believe anything r/politics says? 
$C: A lot of people on reddit have a very idealist view of japan 
$C: I would argue the networks like InfoWars are propaganda since they don't base their claims on evidence.
$C: We don't have the 2nd amendment. That was destroyed many years ago.
$C: What are you talking about god forbid you criticize a politician?! People constantly criticize politicians in power
$C: What about Trump lmao the most criticized being alive 
$C: That was a joke, some UK stations are literally owned by the government. 
$C: Yep. The UK just imprisoned a guy for making a offensive joke. That is the opposite of freedom of speech.

See I can cherry pick cases too! But I have sources.
$C: Right
$C: I was talking about the world. Not US
https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/050615/are-you-top-one-percent-world.asp
$C: Hahaha Reddit hates getting publicity for things like this, it's only inevitable now. It would have been an even bigger shitstorm if they deleted it 
$C: It has to restore it. It's #1 on my front page. First time I have seen it
$C: It was taken down for maybe five minutes?  It also said “stolen video” underneath
$C: This video is extremely dangerous to *our democracy*
$C: He was very influential, hack or otherwise.
$C: His name is STEVE HUFFMAN. Please stop calling him Spez. Also he's a Nazi sympathizer. 
$C: That's what I thought. Maybe there's some other reason it's not appearing on the frontpage.
$C: Going very off topic of the thread, I do respectfully disagree with your point that there's an objective truth behind the shared perception (just as a philosophical matter... probably still a good thing for a scientist to believe). Read this over a couple beers tonight... it'll rock your world: https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/rorty.htm
$C: Long gone? So, you're suggesting it existed at one point?
$C: Yeah, I think "right" or "wrong" are both making claims about "truth". My understanding of postmodern philosophy is that they wouldn't necessarily say "no objective truth". They would probably say that conversations about "objective truth" must necessarily happen in language, and they would start questioning what the language does, rather than what it *means*, given that the history of attempts to assign meaning to language have not done anything useful. 

So... saying a certain media delivery scheme is "false" might be a productive thing to say at this moment. I don't think it's a particularly privileged claim to make, philosophically. That's why I personally am frustrated lately. I would maybe want to change the subject to market concentration in media. (I mean, even for the neoliberals, don't they believe in the "marketplace of ideas" metaphor? How can that work when new firms can't enter the "marketplace"? Even within their own terrible paradigms, this thinking isn't defensible.)
$C: Yeah the majority of the people that watch these channels probably do so to find out about that wreck they saw on the way home from work or why there were 12 police cars at a restaurant earlier that day. Probably don’t even suspect anything fishy with the political pieces. 
$C: I think any product ever should list the top parent owner. The very top. Media included.
$C: > Sinclair to put their names on all the child companie

What child companies is Sinclair trying to operate under? Other than the intimidating, pending Tribune acquisition, I'm not aware of any "parent-child" Sinclair operations. They're pretty in-your-face about it. 

A station website should have a copyright attribution at the bottom of their home page or "About Us" page that identifies who owns them. 

EDIT: Looks like the T_D kids have shown up to support their narrative by discouraging information sharing like I'm trying to do. Sinclair plus T_D fanboys...if that's not brigading and information control, I don't know what is.
$C: If you don't think democrats do this, I feel bad for you. I've heard videos like this ALL the time from left leaning sources. Everytime a new issue arises, people like Hannity/Limbaugh play a soundclip of left leaning sources echoing the exact same phrases just like this clip. Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdL_ZSagUak
$C: lmao
$C: Yes listen to our propaganda please. Not their propaganda. 
$C: Oh yeah and it’s not like Hillary was trying to get into office for corporate influence/power and money because she definitely didn’t get millions from Haiti or anything like that...
$C: what is "the fat mistake"?
$C: >Buzzfeed

>standards

Yeah nah
$C: Lmao who upvotes this shit
$C: I'm gonna frame your original comment with this one underneath it and hang it on my wall. 

You're clearly agenda driven to hide whatever actual influence is going on.
$C: Look at history. Our enemies always did bad things. (So do we)
$C: [deleted]
$C: They're a threat to our democracy./
$C: yea, automod can do that
$C: Well, with the last episode I saw (S2 finale) Tyrell, seems to love Elliot.
$C: I’ll disagree with how you’ve interpreted form his comment. Are you saying life is as great as it was 500 years ago?
$C: It's not a stretch.  For thousands of years the population COULD have exploded but it never did because life was brutally hard. 
$C: The definition is dead or alive in this instance. 
$C: Can you imagine the progress we'd make if we didn't have to bicker with conservatives about the existence of things that exist, like climate change, and instead debate solutions?  Holy shit the right is cancer.
$C: You don’t make the connection that the genie is a metaphor for tyranny and you think I’m the stupid one?
$C: it's in the name of the video....
$C: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stations_owned_or_operated_by_Sinclair_Broadcast_Group
$C: FYI, in addition to featuring actual Nazi Sebastian Gorka (who also has a warrant out for his arrest in his homeland Hungary) that segment was produced by a former Russia Today anchor, Kristine Frazao. Sinclair knows exactly what it is doing.
$C: Because they're all owned by Sinclair and Sinclair has a history of pushing must-run segments.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/business/media/sinclair-broadcast-komo-conservative-media.html
$C: Not everything that's evil is neo Nazi. This practice is certainly evil but it's not about establishing an Aryan nation. 
$C: you're delusional
$C: Sure, here you go.

$C: They were disturbed but not shocked.
$C: When I posted, the thread itself showed as being locked/deleted. Then it wasn't. Oddthings. 
$C: Especially since people use to say this was a "conspiracy theory"
$C: Sort of. It was actually the Bush administration that misrepresented what the intelligence agencies were saying. 

CIA is hawkish. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't listen to them when they are warning us about Russia. Especially since the CIA is conservative and would normally not be opposing Republicans.
$C: CIA is hawkish. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't listen to them when they are warning us about Russia. Especially since the CIA is conservative and would normally not be opposing Republicans.
$C: CIA is hawkish. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't listen to them when they are warning us about Russia. Especially since the CIA is conservative and would normally not be opposing Republicans.
$C: If not for the CIA we wouldn't have the sweet borne trilogy though. So I mean, we can't really complain. 
$C: It's really more about Fox News and the gradual brain drain in the Republican party. They are completely divorced from reality and simply don't care about the truth anymore. It wasn't always like this. 

The 0.1% are part of the problem, and they have way to much political power. But that's nothing new. The current state of politics the US is worse than it has been for at least 60 years. It's bad. 

All that said, we cannot let Russia and Trump off the hook. Or next election it will be China and the EU that get involved. It's a very slippery slope. 
$C: The CIA is hawkish and conservative. So when they are warning us about what the Republicans (fellow conservatives) have done, we need to take it really seriously. 
$C: I think it's unlikely anyone will be going down for treason.

A reminder of what constitutes treason-

>Definition: In Article III, Section 3 of the United States Constitution, treason is specifically limited to levying war against the US, or adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. Conviction requires two witnesses or a confession in open court.

Trump might be removed for otherwise being an idiot but treason isn't gonna happen.

$C: > **in this case**
$C: This is not true at all. This is the most dysfunctional our democracy has been in about 100 years. Downplaying it is dangerous. 
$C: Agreed, and I can only hope that people will pressure their representatives to deal with it.
$C: Can you point out stories that they published that were completely made up? Literal fake news. Also, they could not have redacted it. Sometimes news orgs publish false stories, but any reputable news source will post a redaction. I'm willing to bet you can't find one fake news story that doesn't have a redaction.
$C: and they do publish fake stories knowingly and then recant after they do the damage

no go zones as one example of their broadcasting fake news
$C: Not at all. You're confusing bias with fake. They are different things.
$C: Yeah... You're not listening to me.
$C: State sponsored is a cute little misdirect. 

RT is state run. Full stop.

BBC is a chartered corporation that is funded in part by a TV licensing agreement as well as selling broadcast rights of their shows to other channels and countries. 

By that naming you're able to equate the two since one is directly funded by the state and the other is majority funded by an agreement that's enforced and collected by the government. 

So kind of an omission and convenient phrasing. Exactly what people are saying right wing outlets do, and accuse others of doing, while in fact doing it themselves. You're a microcosm of what's wrong, congratulations!

$C: I think the world is flat.  Do you respect my point of view?
$C: This is dangerous to our democracy.
$C: of course vidya killed the radio star
$C: Are they? I've been reading BBC World News for a while, and they have some pretty juicy stuff about fake news and where it comes from - not just the smaller stuff.
$C: So for as much as you consider FOX News Channel (not Fox Television stations) to be biased, multiply that by 100 and that's how much MORE biased Sinclair is.

Fox O&O affiliates do NOT have Must-Run segments or directives telling the local stations what to report and how. 

Sinclair does. If you disliked Fox News Channel up to now - you're REALLY going to dislike Sinclair.
$C: CNN is also held to a much higher standard than Fox News.. they have actually fired journalists for getting the story wrong in the past. I hate their approach of sticking bunch of obvious trolls on a panel and having fake debates.. but they are nowhere near as bad as Fox News which is just clearly a propaganda wing of the republican party.

edit: lol at the down-votes.. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/business/3-cnn-journalists-resign-after-retracted-story-on-trump-ally.html  

Please find me Fox News doing similar in the decades of pushing propaganda.

This is Fox news on the other hand: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBGudMadlY0

Hannity still works there.
$C: I'm trying to think of a left wing outlet as blatantly biased and lying as Fox News.  It's probably one of those online sites like Jezebel.  
$C: I’ll tell you exactly where this started: The Fox News Channel PR Department.
$C: Lolol Rachel Maddow has been pushing fake Russia propoganda non stop since Trump won. You just can't see it because you believe the shit she spews.
$C: https://youtu.be/RE-uhXKO-nk

Oh hush
$C: It generally comes from the same people and the same reasons as the "both sides are the same!" narrative (which I hope you notice ALREADY frames the "discussion" excluding 3rd parties, or members of either party who don't "toe the party line"). This is *provably false* by looking at the *voting records* of the two "major parties" as well as the bills introduced and when and what they try to (or succeed at) filibuster. 
$C: > Not sure how this shit started

Oh that’s easy, it’s whataboutism and at this point it’s right wing talking points 101 material.  You do something terrible, somebody notices, and then you scream to high heaven about how they’re not so perfect themselves.  You still did the terrible thing, but now you’re talking about how terrible the other guy is.
$C: Your bias is showing
$C: All these stations are owned by 1 of 6 companies.  People make this comparison because people need to stop watching CNN/MSNBC just as much as they need to top watching FOX.  I understand how their practices arn't the same as FOX.

Its all corporate-filtered information, its propaganda.

How much time did CNN/MSNBC spend covering how Dems helped Rep. pass $240B extra 'defense' over the last 2 years.  They decided not to put that in the spotlight.  But they'll talk about how Bernie is crazy for wanting free college which is peanuts to war increase.  He is crazy to want medicare for all.  How much time do they talk about how 16 Dems (including would-be VP Tim Kaine) helped Rep. repeal 2008 wall-street protections.  They can make it a national conversation, but they rather talk about an affair with a pornstar when there is already over a dozen women accusing assault.

Watch some independent media and you'll see how corporate-media omits information, gaslights you, or simply ignores a story.  Your defending cnn/msnbc so I assume your left; check out; secular talk, humanist report, jimmy dore show, jamarl thomas, or Tim BlackTV.
$C: MSNBC is definitely on par with Fox News. They’re both just echo chambers that contribute to the political rift in our country. They should both go away.
$C: >S L I G H T L Y B I A S E D
$C: We all know who started it...Fox News lovers. 
$C: They're implying that all of them are biased.
$C: Well said. This is not a defense of anyone's personal politics, but mudslinging is not an argument. 
$C: https://i.redd.it/xhlklagu8xwz.png
$C: u/YouSaidWut is a good example here. getting caught up on how you didn't pander to the left properly, so therefore you aren't doing this right. And for the record, I lean left politically, and appreciated your level headedness coming into this. You're right, this isn't a left/right issue, but reddit finds a way

Edit: also it bothers me that right is both a direction, and another word for correct. makes my response here look a little fucked.
$C: You're only fooling yourself, if you believe that reason is anything other than having the right connections. If liberal news media could manage the takeovers to cover 72% of US households, they would.  The ruling party is heavily conservative, the odds are stacked strongly in the favour of conservative companies at the moment. If you had Hillary, there's a very good chance we'd be seeing... well, with how in the pocket of big business she is, it's hard to say who she'd sell out to first. 
$C: Covering 72% of households is different than being the only news station in 72% of households. Those households still have other news sources which are overwhelmingly have a corporate left (for lack of a better term) bias.
$C: These are local networks in this video, but the six giant corporations that own the national networks and cable news are clearly anti trump and pushing the pro globalist, neo liberal agenda that their oligarch owners want us to mindlessly follow.

$C: I see their propaganda has had quite an effect on you.
$C: That's fucked. 
$C: Holy shit you’ve kinda made my day already. My friends and family told me I was “weird” and “going to miss the times” because I deleted all my social networks except for reddit. And even here I remove everything from my feed that is politically or current news related. I only saw this because I was subscribe the r/videos. Politics and current events depresses me so I removed it from my life lol. It’s so good to see I’m not some weirdo who is disconnected from everything. 
$C: Better tell that to Bill Maher and Jon Oliver then. 
$C: "a bit"? More like totally and completely try to remove all conservative opinion at any cost. Whenever you Google political topics it has sponsored results from Politifact as the first thing you see. 

[Politifact is incredibly biased.](http://i.imgur.com/xrmKqd7.png)
$C: They have been called conspiracy theorists for rightly stating over and over and over that media is scripted propaganda. I think its pretty astonoshing taking shots at the_donald for being once again proven right. [videos like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZVv2AOCnaA) has been going around for many years without any need to blame t_d Trump or conservatives.

Actually I think its especially cowardly that its being spun as a problem on that side.
$C: > Literally no president sworn in spoke in such fear mongering fashion

bull ucking shait.

Media propaganda plain and simple.

Trump could literally save a baby drowning and media will spin it negatively. Every single time without fail. 

Every single word an action is turned up to 11. Trump is literally Hitler. Every single republican is a racist nazi and so on. And its too late to wind back.

People are realizing media is propaganda.

No amount of paid shareblue employed on reddit posting bullshit can change that.
$C: This anti 1% bullshit was started by the Alt-Right as a way to refer to the Jews in discreet 
$C: Do yourself a favor and visit r/masstagger... Everyone who posts on *that one sub* has a [nice big red warning sign](https://imgur.com/a/Ix2Gh) next to their name on my end ;) 
$C: Lol
$C: The video in the OP is literally of a conservative media conglomerate.
$C: >I like how you found a way to still blame conservatives for the problems in the media lol

Because they are the ones doing this?

Seriously, what are you smoking?
$C: I like how you found a way to blame liberals in a thread about a right-wing propaganda machine...

$C: Thats the point...
$C: What is the actual meaning?
$C: Nobody is going to look at the copyrights. This 'buyer beware' attitude is exactly what is rotting America's heart. Nobody could be arsed to look out for their neighbour. 
$C: Like I said **they are obviously trying to make it seem like a regular news report**. 

Nobody watching this would know it’s a “statement” from Sinclair that they are being forced to read. Why do you think they didn’t preface it with “And here’s a statement from our parent company Sinclair”? Just answer me that

You should pay more attention to who owns the media you consume.  You'd most likely find that it all goes back to the same handful of media titans who share a similar background and similar values, and coordinate to stay on message (ie deciding what becomes a "big story" and what doesn't) whenever possible.
$C: List 5 major failures of Obama,  and 5 major successes of Bush. 
$C: Hey! You can add & subtract! Good job!
$C: The first handful of clips literally includes one Fox affiliate, which isn't even owned by Fox.

All the stations in the clip are owned by Sinclair Broadcasting.  They are who you should be condemning.
$C: no its not, its local news thats owned by sinclair broadcasting... local ABC,NBC , FOX..its all of them
$C: Local Fox broadcasters aren't Fox News.  Sinclair owns the news stations, and they broadcast out of Fox, CBS, NBC, etc.
$C: Uhhh... Obama got shit for wearing a tan suit and for the type of mustard he used. You have no idea what're you're talking about. At all. In any way shape or form. 
$C: It's those immature tweets that make him so easy to constantly attack. He doesn't allow his PR team enough time to deal with the typical political coverup routine. Not being big enough to walk away from certain things, is an easy-to-detect red flag. The ego makes it hard to trust his logic and easy to point out the possibility of it being full of shit. 
$C: Fuck Obama, we're talking about the current sitting President. Quit trying to justify a fat piece of shit by comparing him to somebody else. News flash, Obama wasn't scamming the govt on his golf course, he actually did work, instead of tweeting Fox & Friends. Cnn is Trash, Fox is Trash, it's all Trash, but one isn't feeding the president bullshit though.
$C: Obama was a decent man. A caring father. An impassioned speaker. An eloquent statesman. 

Trump is a baffoon. A philandering gasbag. Bad at giving speeches and worse and governing. 

Character isn't everything but we've all seen what a jerk Trump is, and even if you agree with trumps politics over Obama's, you have to admit that the guy isn't nearly the statesman that Obama was. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: dijon mustard.
$C: You obviously missed the endless scandals that's been the shit show of his career. He isn't going to solve any crisis no matter how much you hope and pray he will. He's a bad leader. He couldn't take of this country during national disasters like how he couldn't take care of his 8 failed business. At one point a homeless man was technically richer then Trump. 
If he's going to do something good, then he'd do it, but he won't because he's Trump, not Obama.
$C: Hahaha, tan suit, Dijon mustard, golfing bad than but good now, fuck off you hypocrite... Heres you're shitty fucking party in a nutshell https://imgur.com/a/VXl1K

$C: > I watch Fox now, but still put cnn every once in a while just to stay objective.

hahahahaah you cant be serious
$C: Lol
$C: Yeah, no. Obama, Hillary, Comey, Rice, and the DNC have all done questionable things: surveillance expansion and drone strikes, DNC candidate bias, and investigation reopening not withstanding, but that simply pales in comparison to the current myriad of insanity that has been the most recent political cycle. 
$C: Just left-leaning media at large.  Not trying to imply that I agree with them.

What I'm interested to see is when more people than less are aware to it and don't have much to lose.
$C: > How is that pro conservative?

Wait, seriously?

Currently, the conservative (by association of party, not practice) PotUS has taken ownership of the term "fake news" and uses it with authority to dismiss coverage from traditional media outlets. 

Sinclair is employing a former GOP campaigner. 

This script is a right-wing shot across the bow to traditional media outlets, accusing them of bias and ethics violations using a verbose script. 

The pro-conservative element extends beyond this clip in isolation. (Requires additional reading/information.) Sinclair has "must-run" elements. These are company-mandated content elements that each of their owned stations must include in their daily broadcasts. (John Oliver covers is as well.) 

These elements include INTENTIONAL pro-GOP news coverage - even if there is no meaningful news coverage to be given to any member of the GOP or their efforts. 

As a contrast - watch any Sinclair-owned news broadcast and compare the same broadcast with the other 2-3 news broadcasts in the market. What you'll see is Sinclair airing a GOP fluff piece when the other 2-3 stations are leading with news coverage that may paint the GOP in a bad light by the nature of the story being covered. 
$C: Look, I agree that journalism sucks now. Every source is biased and you need to make your own conclusions off of multiple sources to get anything done today. I think you're trying to umbrella based on your experience though. People like that exist on both sides and the right news stations are just as biased as the left ones. Plenty of conservatives are brash about their affiliation as well as plenty of democrats. The point is that all of these news stations are shit, not just the left ones.
$C: Lmao, I didn't say the left is beyond criticism nor did I move the goal posts as the entire discussion is on local news stations and what Sinclair Broadcasting group is doing to them.

If you call staying on topic to the actual discussion moving the goal posts, I really don't know what else can be said.
$C: >Hi, you seem to be ignoring my question where I ask you to show where I have stated that the information should not be spread.

$C: It is not the same video.
$C: Because Reddit. 

You didn't answer my question. Did TP already post it and it simply didn't get enough traction or is this just the first time it was posted by a Redditor - submitting interesting content to an aggregation site - and the gold is some person's arbitrary, subjective way of saying "thanks for posting this"? And why is that bothersome to you?
$C: But... I'm using a screen to read right now. I'm confused, should I believe you or not?
$C: I dont think that any real "good" cause exists or will ever exists in our society anymore. Everything is driven by someone for profit. I just cant see myself getting invested in politics, let alone global politics anymore. If its local enough I might be more invested but if I cant reach it I cant do anything anyways. I look around sometimes to see whats happening in the world but not to closely and more out of curiosity.

In the end all I try do is live my life without elbowing other people and make the best life for me at the same time as i can. But yeah I might be a bit cynical and bitter.
$C: If you believe anything CNN says, you should probably do more research...
$C: It was something along those lines
$C: Yep, I don't watch the "liberal" ones anymore either.
$C: done
$C: They’re giving a little statement about how dangerous “fake news” is, because the overarching company is a trump supporting company.

Basically, they’re trying to seed the idea that trump is right, and the “big media” can’t be trusted because of their fake news...

But your happy little local news team can be trusted, because this kind of thing is dangerous to our democracy, and your little hometown focused news team would NEVER cow to the will of a big giant conglomerate or push fake news...

Or so they say, as they do exactly that.

The other must run segments are basically propaganda and trump cheering squads. Look it up. It’s pretty damn bleak. They’re brainwashing America.


$C: Did he not have sexual relationships with women who didn't want it?

How many times has he been to epstiens fuck island? 

And no sir, I'm just as American as Seth rich
$C: [deleted]
$C: It’s not about that, it’s about how one company has tons of control on what we see. There’s absolutely no privacy in that.
$C: my issue is that sinclair is slowly becoming a literal monopoly. The message that we should only trust broadcasts from their affiliates, and especially when presented in the fucked up cult style echo chamber, wouldnt have nearly the same impact if they didnt use the same exact script, its like calling customer support and hearing the automated directory. The message isnt the issue, its the lack of different points of view. its fabricated consolidarity. of course thats just my opinion, im probably a nazi though
$C: Maybe, but I'm still right about our being a democracy.
$C: just like sinclair, google just wants to protect the bottom line. taking on sinclair isnt a good idea if they want to keep their ad providers happy
$C: I doubt everything I read these days. I understand why anchors wouldnt come out publicly, and wish to remain anonymous, but I also wouldnt put it past most news sites to lie about their alleged sources for credibility. Anonymous sources means no way to catch them in a lie. Its extremely dangerous to our democracy, in case you havent heard
$C: Oh, let's compare the definitions of "mob rule" and "majority decide".  Yeah, dude, it's the same thing only I don't snowflake sugar it up.  Conceived within political thought by who?  Loser college professors?
$C: Don't think for a second the hyper leftist elite class don't send out their own propaganda. 
$C: I didn't make the video.  But thanks for the shoutout.
$C: Trump supports this fake news though, he has never called fox or any of these stations fake news, he only saves that line for networks which are critical of him. Why did he hire sinclairs chief political analyst Boris Epshteyn as a campaign adviser if he is against fake news? 
$C: Boris Epshteyn was the Assistant Communications Director for Surrogate Operations for the Trump campaign, and is now Sinclair's senior political analyst. 
$C: Honestly, you are correct. CNN, while probably pushing a slight agenda, is at least giving facts. Fox is just a steamy turd machine. 
$C: Both are 
$C: Now i dont know who to believe
$C: What about that? What exactly are you arguing against here? All I stated was that the people who did this are pro Trump and that Trump likes it because it's biased towards him, just like he loves Fox news but regularly trashes the "MSM"
$C: The point being Trump says that he hates the MSM but he doesn't, he loves it but only when it agrees with him. Fox loves Trump so Trump loves Fox, if Fox started attacking him consistently he'd immediately throw it in the same "fake news" category he puts CNN in

> At least one network reports news that you wouldn't hear anywhere else.

That's not an inherently good thing, Alex Jones reports news you wouldn't hear anywhere else but that doesn't make it good or quality journalism in any way.
$C: > At least one network reports news that you wouldn't hear anywhere else.

It's not news they are reporting, rather fake news, they are currently being sued for their Seth Rich story.

Most people fail to understand the MSM(all three) is now only about 5% news and 95% Op-Ed.
$C: They aren't anti Trump, just reporting the facts.  If those make him look bad, whose fault is it?
$C: Not like he’s doing much of anything else right now...he’s got plenty of time to yell at the TV like the senile old bastard he is.
$C: What are you even going on about?
$C: Did I miss the video of local news stations owned by a left-wing conglomerate? Or are you just talking out of your ass?
$C: > Without getting into this vs. that

He said, pretending to not be desperate to change the subject 
$C: Sinclair broadcasting and fox news are 100% anti-American , anti-science , anti-middle and working class republican propaganda.

There is nothing left-wing that even comes close to matching this bullshit.
$C: CNN is to bad, what FOX, Trump, and Sinclair is to catastrophically bad. There is a difference. CNN isn't trying to open handedly ruined the country and send us into WW3 to physically try to bring about the rapture because they're tired of waiting on Jesus to come back on his own time... Theres a reason trump recognized Jerusalem. Even though he doesn't buy into this shit himself, the people pulling his puppet strings are pulling this straight out of what they think is the prophecy to physically start the process of bringing about the rapture.... Russia is just a happy coincidence, the main players just saw a helping hand, they didn't really stop to consider or even care what his motives were.

That's why it look like they are physically trying to dismantle this country and its government.
$C: CNN actually is pretty trustworthy and is quick to admit errors. They are very biased but they really aren't that bad overall
$C: These are their local affiliates, they're not national "mainstream" news like CNN or MSNBC. [They're owned by Sinclair, a right wing media giant, which uses it's clout to push conservative politics on these local affiliates.](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/sinclair-broadcasting-puts-partisan-tilt-trusted-local-news)
$C: Sinclair == Trump propaganda.
$C: Doesn't matter. Sinclair pushed this content, not their mother networks.
$C: And once Moore got the nomination Trump endorsed Moore. Even after the allegations against Moore came to light Trump was backing him.
$C: Right. 


https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/12/04/why-is-trump-endorsing-roy-moore/
$C: If you distrust the posted articles too much to click on them, here's a direct link a Tweet by Trump endorsing Roy Moore.

https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/937641904338063361
$C: Yeah he did.  
$C: Go back to T_D with your lies.
$C: Bannon got him to endorse Moore. Quit lying
$C: It must be fun to live in a bubble where you can ignore facts you don't like. 

The downside is, of course, when you go out of your bubble and try to attack others who aren't as ignorant as you.
$C: Hey do you have any thoughts about repeatedly being proven a liar
$C: FOX, CBS, NBC, ABC affiliates are not automatically owned by that network.  Most are not.  Only the ones in major cities, e.g. New York, L.A., Dallas are actually owned by the networks.

> Do you really think CBS ... Bakersfield fucking California is right wing?

The CBS affiliate in Bakersfield, California is [KBAK-TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KBAK-TV), which is owned by Sinclair Broadcasting.

So yes.  Yes it is.
$C: With youtube the counter always stops at a set number whenever anything is rapidly mass watched and will take hours sometimes for the counter to catch up. I remember for Gangnam Style the counter was stuck at less than 50k for most of the day despite it being at the top of reddit the same amount of time. 
$C: Well, it's currently at 1.1M views, so not sure why you threw this tantrum.
$C: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/business/media/sinclair-broadcast-komo-conservative-media.html
$C: So what's the difference between the video we just watched and propaganda?
$C: It is a propaganda machine when that company forces owned and company-friendly stations to air segments verbatim that have a strong political bent.
$C: It’s all one segment, that an executive pushed a ‘send to all’ button on.

It’s an amusing clip as opposed to the Orwellian hysterics in this thread.
$C: Right, the human mind thinks it's echo's are a sign
$C: But I expect two Walmarts to be the same. Why would I expect the local news in Dallas and Seattle to have the same talking points? 

Sinclair's ownership of many local news channels is not well known. At least with CNN and FOX their reach and slant are regularly on display.
$C: >no one watches multiple local news stations.

Exactly.  They're now tricked into thinking this is a locally representative opinion, rather than corporate propaganda.
$C: It doens't matter no one watches more than one, what matters is everyone screams 'democracy' and fake news with the same knowing glance and head nodding.

Just like racists after jim crow talked about cultural purity
$C: [deleted]
$C: Yes. Fake news is specifically as a meme, designed to divide people without making them actually discuss the issue.
$C: Yes because they are the purveyors of fake news, but their message is that everyone else’s news is fake and theirs is real. It’s manipulation of the masses. 
$C: You’re literally in a thread about video evidence of that happening 
$C: I don't have a team. 

The real issue is that monopolies reduce competition. Media is our source of information, and information should always be subjected to debate and scrutiny to ensure it is as accurate as can be reasonably determined. A lack of competition in the information marketplace means reduced scrutiny, means the health of the information may be poor and we're unable to make good, informed decisions. Throw in a change over the last few decades to 'opinion over fact' (in terms of what constitutes 'news') and you end up in a situation where only the emotional response to any information is what matters. So the news you get is deliberately biased to ensure that you feel a certain way. THAT IS NOT GOOD. Worse when the opinion isnt even the result of a diverse cast of 'talking heads' each debating their own position. When all talking heads are reading from the same talking points and not adding their own analysis, you're not even getting "Same side" analysis. All just fed. Just bullshit. At least under the old paradigm Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity are two different people with 2 different perspectives. But imagine if Rupert gave each of them an identical script. Now you can't even debate amongst your own team what its stance is.

For your information seeing as you wanna beat at this, I used to be something like a die hard republican. I'm not American, your media just extends that far. I thought it was stupid that people would vote Democrats just because of their skin colour, or their gender. (From those days I do remember that actually most married women vote conservative). I hated seeing blatant lies put out there by Libtards/Asshats/Whatever we were calling them, and gobbled up by a willing media. I hated that the media constantly reported lies about things in Iraq/Afghanistan to suite their own agendas. I thought heads should roll when it was demonstrated that so called 'reliable' news sources were doing shit like photoshopping pictures of warzones to make them look more terrible than they would otherwise look (I vaguely recall some stuff about using the cloning tool on some smoke). I used to read littlegreenfootballs and all those guys.

But you know what? The republicans, the democrats, they both have the same fucking illnesses. So do their 'base'. I've watched the base change a bit too, but they'll swear they're the same as they ever were. 

On the possibility that you're not simply a shill I will tell you this- the people at the heads of these parties, they don't believe the same stuff as you do. They're not on your side, ever. The turnover is too low for that to happen. Your cultural beliefs may have been set by them, they may make speeches you nod your head to, but thats all that is. Its not more real than anything that goes on at a Hollywood set.  They don't live in your world. Now you're probably a believer right now, and I can't break that, and I'm not going to try to. I'll leave you with a quote that to me sums up the gulf that exists between what politicians say, what they're willing to do, what they believe.

>We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them


EDIT: No, I will say one more thing just in case you're a normal human being. I don't consider what came before Trump to be the ideal, nor am I seeking a reversion to 'status quo' /pre-Trump/pre-Fakenews. Trump got where he did saying what he did precisely because the credibility of media organisations was shredded by their own inability to self-police during the Bush years. This is an excellent time to re-establish that the media is a central part of democracy, and it must hold itself to its highest possible standards at all times. No more fucking circle jerking to push a narrative (pro or anti war). Just the goddamn facts.

$C: I disagree.  Trump is typically so incoherent that what he actually says is almost always up for debate.  Left-wingers will interpret it as maliciously as possible even when it's benign, and right-wingers will sanitize it to make it sound less bad than it is when it actually is bad.
$C: It appears you may be retarded. Let me explain like you're retarded.

These are affiliates of NBC and ABC and CBS.

An affiliate is a company owned less than 50% by the parent company. So the station may be an ABC affiliate, but the majority is owned by Sinclair broadcasting now. They are a right wing conservative group. They can (and obviously do) send canned messages for their reporters to read.

This is what you're seeing in the video.

The reason I bring politics into it is because the FCC relaxed rules to make this acquisition possible.  Boris ephsteyn is a Russian born Republican political strategist and currently lead political strategist at the company.
$C: The underlying plan is to discredit other sources than the „local“ station. Their message is not to fact check all the news including the ones they broadcast, but to keep people away from consuming other news than the ones of „their local“ station. 

And it works perfectly for them, local news have the advantage that most of their stories are 100% correct and concern the viewership as these things are just local news like the mayor announcing bike lanes or a benefit gala for the local police dog school. This raises the trust in the local station among the people and this trust is then used by the bigger news entity to spread their spin on stories which are bigger than the local networks range, like federal politics, science or anything.

It’s like a wolf buying a sheep coat to tell you how to think, and not to consume other sources, as _they are a threat to our democracy_
$C: > because the message is objectively neutral

It’s not... only one person has been grinding the term “fake news” into people’s heads, and now your local news is blatantly supporting that narrative, AND ITS ONLY BECAUSE THEYRE BEING PAID/FORCED TO DO SO. It’s totally fucked because any reasonable person knows what to expect from CNN or FOX News, it’s no surprise they spin things to their known leanings, but you don’t expect it from your local news station like this. This message is meant to discredit all other news sources (they’re saying how important facts are to them after all), yet how ironic that they only state this when guided into it by corporate ownership... 

if they want to make this argument go ahead and run some specific pieces on the facts behind other fake stories that have been run, that might actually be helpful... but vague warnings that you can’t trust anyone but them are not helpful in the least (and potentially very damaging to our democracy). After all an individual does not even have the capacity to fact check every news story they come across, at best you have to refer to facts published by a variety of journalists, if you’re now being told trust no one else then how do you even go about fact checking something in the first place?
$C: >the message is objectively neutral

LOL what a fucking joke. please don't tell me you really believe that?
$C: Why are they sympathizing with any side ? It’s supposed to be the news about events, not trying to convince people. 
$C: >because the message is objectively neutral and everyone benefits from second guessing what they hear on the news or on social media



First sentence in and you’re already at strike one. “This is dangerous to our democracy” is objectively neutral? Why the fuck are you trying to twist this with terminology?
$C: >  isn't sinister

It's a huge collection of "local" news organizations that are actually controlled by a central authority casting doubt on all other sources of news. It's exceedingly sinister.
$C: It's not the message itself that is bad. The message itself is fine. It's the hypocrisy behind the message that is bad. It's the implication that they are a reliable source of "real," unbiased news, and that others are not.
$C: No.  I can also speak in Trump-supporter:

Illegals!  Rosanne real America mother fucker! Fake news pussy grabbing sad!
$C: You really believe CNN doesn’t lie, omit facts, alter quotes, and skew stories to push a liberal narrative? 
$C: That's funny, because this has only been possible thanks to the telecommunications act of 1996 that Bill Clinton signed.
$C: You mean like the integrity Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Anthony Weiner, Barack Obama, and numerous others have shown? What rock do you live under?

Maybe the integrity of Obama with Fast and Furious, the doubling in 8 years of the national debt, the significant increase of welfare users and increase of those in poverty while wages fell.

Or maybe the Integrity of Bill Clinton with the numerous illicit affairs he had in the White House (and prior) with his aides while married to the beast of a woman Hillary.

Or maybe Hillary who is a victim shamer and loves financially raping her mindless followers.

Or maybe Anthony Weiner and his... Well... penchant for showing off his weiner.

Isn't that Democrat integrity great!

Or maybe the Kennedy that killed a woman while drunk and left her to die if she wasn't already dead.

Be proud of that Democrat integrity! 😂😂😂
$C: I honestly haven't seen too much division in news agencies at least politically. They can be hyper-critical (i.e. New York Times) but local news is generally just local news and 30 seconds on some trending topics. Even back in 2003 ABC news were hyper critical over the Iraq war justifications with WMD investigations, and the moment the administration rang the bell, all the news organizations fell into line. Its that way, all the time, perenially. 
$C: Google "Sinclair political lean" and let me know what you find.

You can also just go to their Wikipedia page, where there is an [entire section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_Broadcast_Group#Political_views) devoted to it.

> Sinclair's stations have been known for featuring news content and programming that promote conservative political positions, and have been involved in various controversies surrounding politically-motivated programming decisions, such as news coverage and specials during the lead-ups to elections that were in support of the Republican Party.

I understand that that's a lot of work for you though.  Easier to just call me a retard instead.
$C: Surely you'll have no issue then providing evidence that one conglomerate has owned ~72 percent of stations before, as Sinclair does now, and that this company issued "must-run" segments to its stations, as Sinclair has done.
$C: Another kid upset by inconvenient truths.
$C: >yellow journalism

If you're talking about project veritas then yes.
$C: Honestly not even sure what you're responding to. The person I was replying to thought this was a wire service story and I was pointing out that it's not. It's a script handed down from an openly conservative organization that owns all of these stations.
$C: In your initial comment, you're talking about wire service stories like Reuters or the AP. As you know, if you subscribe to one of these services, you can run their stories (or not run them) at your leisure, and it's a common way for local papers to inform their readers about national news without having to undergo the impossible task of basing reporters all across the country. These wire service stories are written by reporters, and undergo fact-checking and editing, and run corrections as needed. 

OP's video, on the other hand, is a script handed down by Sinclair that they required all of their stations to read. I'm just pointing out the objective difference here.
$C: I agree that it is wrong to refer to us as a democracy and I think we should start referring to ourselves as a Republic. I should mention that if there were a group of people who went and started a democracy, I would hope that it worked out for their sake. I think there's no need to be that negative since we can't change their minds.
$C: The media that is anti Trump 24/7 for the past 2+ years is right wing?   huh?
$C: You realize these videos are all main stream media organizations preaching to not believe news that’s not them. If anything these are left leaning news broadcasts. 
$C: Gonna disagree with you there since you're a regular on a sub that pushes pretty much nothing but fake news.
$C: You need help man. Did you not know this was a right wing group behind this bullshit? It's a proven fact the right creates and digests the majority of fake news. Yes, Trump Derangement Syndrome exists but you're the only one suffering from it. 
$C: I did see one nbc and abc after rewatching. Still, in the bulk of the video. Fox and cbs were the two most represented. 
$C: No shit, Sherlock. In what part of my comment would you glean otherwise?
$C: That flawless logic /s

Oooooooh, he's a troll. Nothing to see here people. 
$C: Actually...yeah. My apologies u/WesternLog
That was too far
$C: Broadcast news is different from an online forum. They serve 2 different purposes. One broadcasts the news. The other is where people go to discuss it.
$C: I guess Sinclair could be considered that.  

I've never known the other media owners to give stations a script that they are forced to read like a hostage video.
$C: Careful with all that hypernatremia, son! 
$C: Youtube trending is weird and it usually takes several hours for news stories and smaller creator videos to crack Trending from what I've seen. 
$C: Well this just shows how judgmental you are about the American public, the majority of people don't want guns. Or maybe you missed that massive march to restrict them about a week ago. And the national school walkout a few weeks ago. Stop judging us please. It's not helping how fucked up things are over here. 
$C: coming from the party who thinks there are 175 different genders...
$C: i can tell you are from mississipi. only someone from there would think that age = intelligence. pretty pathetic but i wont argue with uneducated rednecks with no teeth or brain. see my username.  
$C: Typical right wing corruption. Nothing new.
$C: and your immediate family with 0 information and  critical thinking is? At least college teaches to think for yourself.not just take grandpappys word as law.  see username.
$C: Since you want attention. 
$C: Your story sounds made up, because it is made up.  You're bad at lying...
$C: Notice how Trump does not call all news fake, just the ones that are not kissing his ass 24/7? Has he ever called fox news fake? Or any of the stations listed in this video? Why? Why is it only critical news stations he refers to as fake? Why did he hire sinclairs chief political analyst Boris Epshteyn as a campaign adviser? You can keep trying to twist it how you like but the facts are there for everyone to see
$C: I play ps4 and live with a mate thanks.

Well when you say the dumbest shit, and you post for the first time, and the best comeback you have is "you live with your mom" it makes me wonder if there is a difference between you being a robot or human. You have the depth of a kiddie pool.
$C: Elaborate.
$C: So, no?
$C: Just saying, you said not to trust the media's commentary on Trump despite these supposed foul things he's done. Just wanted to know what you consider foul aside from his language. Just weird that you'd include him at all since this post doesn't have anything to do with him as far as I can tell.
$C: Can you show me a single instance where the MSM can be found reading off identical marching orders, like this costly displays?
$C: What difference does that make? It's happened before, and it's happening now. The problem is that the more media outlets consolidate, the less competition, and the more of an echo chamber we see. Over time, the media is going to devolve and take the rest of us down with it.
$C: The difference is this corporation is doing the bidding of a President and working for the government and his cronies in order to invalidate criticism of his administration. 
$C: > you seem to have missed the part where I say MSM not independant networks.

No you seems to have missed the fact that MSNBC, Fox, CNN, and all MSM outlets are independent from each other and will not word for word parrot one another.

All MSM might cover the same stories but still they will not say the exact same things word for word because they are independent of each other and not being given a script to read by a 3rd party that controls all of them
$C: I more meant that most people understand we elect representatives to vote for us, and they just think that's called democracy. But yeah, there are still plenty of people who think we are a true democracy, and have no clue how our system works on a fundamental level. So actually, I retract my original statement, you have a good point.
$C: You don't need to have a purely democratic government in order to *value* democracy. Democracy is one of America's core values. Yes we have a constitutional republic, but the point of our constitutional republic is to be democratic. Threats to democracy are threats to our constitutional republic. 
$C: They are being told what to say and when to say it. 
If there is a news story about to be reported that sinclair disagrees with, or could damage republican interests, they could easily prevent that story from being reported. 
We basically have state tv like russia at this point
$C: Everyone with the opportunity to should watch/listen to their local PBS and NPR affiliates, and donate when possible. When you don’t rely on corporate ad revenue the way CNN, MSNBC, and FOX do you don’t need to be sensational.

$C: No. I just said they are not journalists. They are propagandists.
$C: Idunno, I haven't even had my coffee yet.
$C: Of course it's their fault.  No shit.  I don't want the idiotic 35% of America being fed widespread corporate-sponsored propaganda on top of their own ignorance.  This isn't run-of-the-mill business-as-usual-shit.  This is straight up new-age, unprecedented propaganda.  It propagates because it *works*.  The people in charge don't even realize what is happening - they just see profit margins and partisan bias. 

If you can't see why this is bad, you have a very poor understanding of history or social influence.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Show me a video of them pushing left wing propaganda in unison like that
$C: Just their lengthy history of doing exactly this, and the fact that all the stations in the video are owned by Sinclair.

$C: All of the networks shown here are pro-trump owned Sinclair Broadcast Group
$C: I welcome people's ignorant downvotes.

EDIT: but have an upvote regardless ;)
$C: Not sure what your point is here...
$C: Because Fox News is one singular entity, and its bias is well-known.  Most viewers don't know about local stations' corporate interests.

> Is the fact that it was played on several local news stations, instead of just the national one

Which "national one"?  They're all affiliates for different networks.

> even though it probably effectively reached a lesser amount of viewers?

It probably reached far more, believe it or not.
$C: Look pal, I’m not interested in your manifesto. The reality is that Sinclair forced their stations to air a statement they wrote while trying to hide the fact that is was a statement that Sinclair wrote. That’s a fact. Give it a break with your nonsense suggestions like “Well uh cause PC”
$C: They're not protesting. 
$C: So where do you get your information? Also, what would you consider the worst?
$C: it's kinda of hard to ignore "Trump says stupid shit"
$C: >	they probably say every night

They don’t 
$C: Aren't all speeches biased?
$C: I mean, depending on what you're bringing to the table, we can go with a classic cheese and tomato. For a landslide local election I can throw in lettuce and mayo, maybe some ketchup. Unless you can guarantee me a senate seat, I will have to withhold the bacon and sauteed mushrooms and swiss cheese. A senate seat plus a generous donation will get you all of the above, plus caramelized onions and a crispy brioche bun.
$C: Networks don't own most of their affiliates.  All of these stations are owned by Sinclair.  I literally provided you a list of the first few stations to appear in this video.

$C: She represents a danger to our democracy despite not holding any elected office for six years now?

That woman lives rent-free in your head.
$C: This video and the comments which show how many news stations they now own??
$C: Edit: actually, IM not trying to stop anyone from saying what they want, but yeah plenty of people here clearly are. Not "no one" like i said first

Free Speech? yeah those broadcasts were clearly well thought out by each individual station, and its purely coincidence that they matched word for word.

This issue isnt what they said, it was the manipulation in an attempt to gain trust from their respective local markets. Also never said the right was stupid, and the left was smart. If you want a stance from me though, every single point in the political spectrum has ignorant dumb asses, and intelligent people. 

And I have no issue with sinclairs conservative views. Theres always space for debate and views that differ from eachother. But to claim the left is wholey wrong, and the right is wholey right (sorry, couldnt resist the repetition) is equally as absurd as the inverse. refering to your words btw, not SBGI. Sinclair has every right to exist, as does CNN, but neither should have the right to an unregulated monopoly. No one is saying they cant say what they want, but flooding the nation with a single point of view, while actively trying to crush any and all opposition is incredibly dangerous. Trump's whole "drain the swamp" thing applies equally here. This is fucked up, and the left is pissed about it. Seen alot of conservatives on here pissed off about it too. No one wants this to be censored, everyone is trying to bring this to light right now.

Apparently accountability doesn't apply to sinclair though
$C: The point is not that people on the left are smart and the people on the right are dumb because that is not true. But there is some disproportionate number of rightists who watch things like Alex Jones which is so far gone that it scares the left. It scares the left because there are things said that aren't even remotely true after things said that are just political view dependent. I understand the entertainment value of Alex Jones for example though. He's not afraid to say things, he's angry, aggressive and absolutely hilarious occasionally. However, in some cases, like in the case of my roommate, the viewer keeps watching for entertainment and ends up recieving information from the source. I'll provide a quick example of an objectively false statement to show "the danger" that the left talks about. Alex Jones said, "666 is the doubling of 33 and 33 is pi." Clearly the news sources like Sinclair are not as extreme as this, but this is the sentiment. What the left worries about is that news is becoming too much entertainment value and not enough information value, but people are choosing not to take their sources with a grain of salt. It's dangerous because it's misinformative and polarizing. The left has these sources too. No doubt. I think there are plenty of people on both the right and the left who take their news with a grain of salt and think critically about issues and try to understand the other side, but the people we see from the other side are always the idiots because that's who stands out. The person you meet on the subway who has a nice smalltalk conversation with you doesn't stand out even though they might be the intellegent person willing to talk and reason. There are more intellegent people than dumb people on both sides (that's my belief anyway) and we just can't tell.

$C: Do you think lying helps make your argument stronger? Clinton went down for lying about a sexual act under oath. Trump is currently under scrutiny for campaign finance laws. Doesn’t matter the reason behind the payment. It’s the payment that’s illegal (if true) 

That also has nothing to do with this argument. The media bias being shown is that of right wing, not left. I’m aware most of the media has a left wing bias. However, all the people that complain about that are usually watching Fox News as if it has no right wing bias.
$C: Trump appointed Ajit Pai(a long time swampmonster and Verizon lobbyist) to the FCC who is set to allow Sinclair to purchase another company which will give Sinclair somewhere around 70% share of the local news market. Ajit Pai has already changed FCC rules in anticipation for green lighting this merger

$C: His name was robert paulsen.
$C: Can we be sure
$C: Dangerous
$C: No, it's natural for politicians in any form of government to seek money and power.
$C: You're exactly backwards. Name me some examples of monopolies that lasted that didn't have some kind of government assistance. 

And since I can guess you're going to be super original and say 'Standard Oil',  I'm happy to talk about how it is not such an example, but let's see if you can name anything else.
$C: TIL when the government does anything, it's capitalism's fault. 

Or wait, is this the new version of 'thanks, obama'?
$C: Yes put words in my mouth. Did you even read my comment?  I categorized a single widespread message going out as a negative thing.  Do you know how communism and socialism actually work?  In pure socialism the government is in control of everything, and that includes the media. Do you believe in a socialist society there wouldn't be a single message going across the media?    Do you believe that in that sort of system there would be no corruption? Sure, in a perfect world these systems are great, but we don't live in a perfect world. Human nature just doesn't allow these systems to work. In both socialism and communism there is no reason to over achieve. These systems kill any sort of advancement, and would put society into a stand still, or even possibly a decline.  Why put any extra effort into anything if you're going to be rewarded the same as the person putting in the bare minimum. I'm not saying any of these systems are better than the other.  Rather that these system must be combined if something actually effective is to be achieved.  Maybe try going outside of your echo chamber every once in a while.
$C: You do understand communism, in all its implemented forms (so far), has had vastly more failures? One can subscribe to capitalist ideology and at the same time understand that the system isn’t perfect without regulation. Not exactly sure who would applaud monopolies, except for the people running them.
$C: The news is supposed to educate you, not make you feel happy. Our current news barely does even that. 

Instead of focusing on important things and doing their civic duty, they obsess over tabloid garbage, cover certain topics for a disproportionate amount of time because they generate buzz, and completely ignore other things because either their corporate sponsors demanded it or it wasn't interesting enough. 
$C: Okay vlad
$C: "Let's make the sewer grate again!"

$C: Hands off my eye holes!!!
$C: Armed to the teeth.
$C: This is the distinction I was looking for. [Relevant simplification from SMBC](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/an-important-distinction)
$C: Some of my best friends are nationalists, as a patriot, this is an argument we used to have frequently. They would say that I couldn't be a patriot if I didn't agree that MERICA was the best country in the world and 100% perfect. We have agreed to disagree.
$C: Unfortunately, language is defined by how it's used, and the state of our national political discourse doesn't leave a lot of room for distinguishing patriotism from nationalism.

Or, as another user summed it up: https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/an-important-distinction
$C: Patriotism should be stuff like rooting for your country's football team. 

Nationalism is really scary though. 
$C: The thing is though, the more you cut and chop what counts as and what counts separate to 'your country' the less the word even means anything.

Does loving your country mean loving everyone in it? Even the racist, the vile and the abborant? Okay no, so love your country always and its people and government when deserved.

So what about the infrastructure? Are you meant to love it unconditionally too, even when it's failing, even if it's corrupt? Even if it's needlessly falling hundreds out thousands? Even when it's been controlled by greedy and uncaring businesses? No?..

The problem is that unconditionally loving any individual part of your country is stupid, but loving anything *when it's deserved* is just normal behaviour, nothing to do with patriotism.

Quotes stupid. 
$C: Or they are are too blind to allow their principles to change with the world. 
$C: Patriotism is also the reason we need to shut shit like this down. 

The news should be the gatekeeping whistleblowers who keep informed on the shady shit that happens behind closed doors in Washington and boardrooms everywhere

If I had one wish, it would be to have enough wealth to completely fund a news organization that didn't rely on commericals to stay afloat.
$C: That’s the stupidest thing I’ve read all day.
$C: **Hatred of taxes** is the only reason this country exists and if you refuse to accept that then you are just lying to yourself.
$C: Reddit doesn't want you to say they're lying to themselves, you're bad for saying this, Reddit wants to upvote the good guy from down the comments who wants to do 'good things' once (when, if) he is wealthy. F"ck the truth, f"ck the reality, we support **good guys** and **good wishes**! 

This is the scariest thing I see daily on Reddit. There simply **must** exist forces and institutions who exploit such human behaviour out there. Oh wait......
$C: and in america, the police can murder you, your kids, or your dog, and take a paid vacation on your tax dollars 
$C: Both of those factions were fueled by extreme nationalism (or patriotism as we call it here in the US). The holocaust happened because the Germans of the time wanted to restore their national pride after the harsh sanctions put on them following WW1 and Hitler used Jews and other foreigners as a scapegoat to turn that nationalism in his favor. The atom bombs were only ever used on Japan because they wouldn't surrender a losing war out of blind devotion to their country and especially their emperor.
$C: Many men have died from stupid causes. It is no less unfortunate, but there is no "nobility" in serving your country, from an objective standpoint.
$C: If you're wondering why so many downvotes, it's likely because you need a history lesson and not one from grandma. 
$C: > Do you think the average Russian or Chinese citizen doesn't realize their news is full of shit? They do; they just can't say it out loud without facing dire consequences. And it's no accident: The quality of their propaganda is god-awful.

Hilariously this is exactly what the propoganda of your country is telling you.

Do you think China/Russia are some backwards ass shitholes in the middle of nowhere and not global super powers just like the US?

Their propaganda is just as good.
$C: We most certainly are, if for no other reason than people can and do say we're not on our media without fear of death. That doesn't mean we're perfect.
$C: No we definitely are. By literally every metric. 
$C: Tbf, BBC is held to a responsibility of impartiality. Its not perfect, so long as humans are involved I don't think it ever could be, and there's definitely a few unimpartial stations and news sources over here, but we hold the BBC news especially to a higher standard than most. 
$C: Like cold beer on a Friday night.
$C: So does Germany and the UK among others.
$C: So does the UK and the BBC is way better than most American corporate media.
$C: This guy likes to hang onto me like a barnacle because that's what Reddit PR shills do when they're trying to suppress information.

Russia: Not awesome, but far less dystopic than the US has become. Their information sphere is far less polluted than ours. But cold af. Difficult language. Hot women though.
$C: Sure, but the Russian language info-sphere appears to be far less polluted by political and corporate influences. Unfortunately, I don't speak Russian so it's a form of soft-encryption for me.
$C: What makes you think public broadcasting organizations are unbiased and uncorruptible? Who do you think picks out the executives and therefore the content of public news organizations?
$C: Poland. The bastion of freedom. Shining cultural center of democracy.
$C: Yeah, so instead of a private monopoly on media, we just get propaganda straight from the PiS.
$C: Poland is second world.

You said first world. 
$C: You are right that other countries have laws to prevent monopolies (my country included), but as you have also pointed out the Sinclair Group doesnt have a monopoly.

Free to air media broadcast in particular makes an interesting case study for market economics. Unlike other industries, broadcasters dont make their money directly from the viewers. Access to viewership is the product they sell to advertisers.

Free media is a very important aspect of liberal democracy - freedom of the press is the most important mechanism by which government is accountable. The suggestion that a government should have discretion over the reach of media breaks down accountability. I submit that it would actually be a step toward the Orwellian dystopia.

Would it be fair to assume your objection to this particular company stems from their message being contrary to your political view point? If you were to turn the tables, and consider a broadcaster who uses their influence to push a more p1-o2 friendly agenda, would you still trust a government (whom you may not agree with) to regulate it?
$C: How does that not apply to for-profit corporations? What would stop Murdoch from funding a non-profit news organization and running it exactly as he wishes, financed by his entertainment business? Restricting the freedom of the press is a bad idea, end of story.
$C: Which liberal politicians are trying to pass major finance reforms that would heavily benefit rich corporations at the expense of the American people? Because that seems to be strictly a conservative tactic. 

I have no problem with politicians catering to the media. That's not the issue here. The issue here is that these journalists are now bought and paid for, just like the politicians.

One of the benefits of a free press is that they're supposed to exist as a check against the government propaganda, not be purveyors of it.
$C: Her gesturing also seemed to signal “THIS - right here, what we’re doing right now - IS extremely dangerous to democracy.” Maybe trying to mantain personal integrity?
$C: Shout out to the man who said “This is extremely dangerous to our demarcacy”
$C: “This is... LINE!”

“Thank you. Extremely dangerous to our democracy.”
$C: Fight the system from within!

$C: Which politicians would those be again? The Democrats who use their connections to big industry to fundraise for those campaigns? Or the Republicans who use their connections to slightly different big industry to fundraise for those campaigns?
$C: >  the solution is to vote in November for politicians who will pass and ENFORCE antitrust legislation

Good luck with that. Republicans would never vote for anti-trust legislation and the Democrats use their fundraising apparatus and aligned PAC's to knock progressive candidates out in the primaries.
$C: The problem is we can vote for whomever but at the end of the day politicians will do what large corporations pay them to do. 

Edit: not all of them. Some do care.
$C: Oh boy another one of those arguments of "we just have to elect the right people, things will be fine."  Good luck with that.  Also,what is the supposed antitrust violation here?
$C: As a libertarian my idea of a solution is actually to abolish the CIA, NSA, BPS, NPR and the federal reserve, among other affronts to our liberty by the state, that are actually causing this problem. I can understand that it's an unpopular opinion and I won't see much agreement here though, I hope I don't get banned from this sub for this comment, though it wouldn't especially surprise me if I did.
$C: Voting for them doesn’t do much. They have to also make it a priority, which they won’t. It hurts their bottom line. It’s much easier to say you support that then focus on other things.  Simply voting won’t change that. All we have is the lesser of two evils. 
$C: Why not? Isn't that what anti-trust laws are? Isn't the point of those laws to keep the market competitive?

In capitalist systems, capital and business are like drops of water, they bump together, one sucks up the other and becomes bigger, moves on to suck up more or get sucked up by an even bigger drop.  Eventually those drops turn into enormous puddles and your options as a consumer dwindle from thousands to what you can count on your hand. Without any regulation, monopolies form and kill the markets that allowed them to grow in the first place because it's not in their interest to let anyone else compete with them.

That is to say, an unregulated market will always succumb to the gravity of business and capital and kill itself. There needs to be some mechanism to stop that from happening. While the businesses might say such a mechanism is harmful to them because it stifles their growth, their growth is exactly what those mechanisms are there to prevent.
$C: Saw it coming
$C: It is Futurama. The above quote is from the episode *A Head In The Polls*.

$C: In any case, tv media is on an anti-social media campaign. Then #deletefacebook happened. We pick up our pitchforks and just end up being pawns. Seems like that one black mirror episode where he gets a tv show were he is ranting but is part of the problem he rants against
$C: Stop smoking so much. You’d see he’s right. 
$C: [removed]
$C: The points he was making in his initial comment are accurate. I probably wouldn't agree with most things this guy believes in because, ya know, his name is redpilled_brit and those redpill folks are idiots, but even a blind pig finds an acorn once in a while.

$C: We *could* but when they control the majority of the origins of the message who is going to even know better? How is someone in the middle of the midwest going to even think, I'd better check this out. I do, because it's important and interesting to me, but there are a lot of people who just need to work, provide, and have some downtime. I feel bad for us. They've really got it rigged at this point.
$C: Please tell me who is going to break them up? This is not a "both sides are the same" argument but seriously, both sides do have these massive monopolies. Maybe not in the local news sector, but nationally there are massive monopoly's on both sides. We're fast approaching the time where voting doesn't even matter. 

"Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" 

It would be wise to remember the above once November passes and we reach 2020 with out any major change one way or another.
$C: You mean like when we elected a Democratic congress in 2006 and a Democratic president on 2008 and they broke up those "too big to fail" banks that caused the financial crisis?
$C: You realize the government is controlled by two parties yesh! :o

oh dear! :O
$C: You're funny. 
$C: Yeah, cause that's been working so well.

Seriously can we stop with this bullshit of its okay we can vote blah blah blah. 

No we can't. The system has been rigged against us. 

It's not hopeless but it sure isn't as simple as vote them out. That's a nice platitude that doesn't mean shit today. 
$C: > We can vote for people who will break up these big media conglomerates, i.e. Comcast, Sinclair group, etc. The midterms are coming up in November.

Lol, no.

The big media companies control/manipulate/influence far more voters than "we" ever could.

Best bet is become successful through other means and buy a controlling interest in those companies (say, like AOL did with TimeWarner long ago).


$C: > The midterms are coming up in November.

Just a reminder for the uninitiated not to wait for the general midterm elections. Your state's primary may be coming up to elect a single nominee for both the democratic and republican party. Find a candidate from your party that you align with and vote for them in the primary. For example, you can find a candidate that is against unnecessary wars, lofty government spending, even supports marijuana legalization, if that's your thing. If you wait until the general election in November you might be choosing between the lesser of two evils that only supports 1 out of 5 of your ideals/initiatives.
$C: the greatest problem i believe to democracy is money. if you have a candidate that wants to end these monopolies, he/she needs funds to run and those monopoly guys are the same people who fund elections. the rich become the gatekeepers so to speak.
$C: Media control isn’t a political thing, people on both sides of the aisle are owned by telecommunications giants. It’s naive to think that the same people who put this beast of information control into power would ever want to remove it. 
$C: Oh please. American democracy doesn't exist. First past the post voting, the electoral college and gerrymandering have ensured that. There is no way to vote them out because the two major parties have designed it that way. A vote for anyone other than the two major parties is a vote "thrown away" and only the two major parties can reform it to be more democratic. Naturally that will never happen. So save your bullshit "the midterms are coming up, let's just vote super hard this time guyz. Even though people say the same thing every election this time will be different." because it won't change shit. 

Your democracy is terminally ill. The sooner you accept that fact and stop looking towards your homoeopathic remedies of attempting to vote out those who have rigged the system the sooner it will be cured. 
$C: You're absolutely right. We need to vote for the people these corporate media outlets hate.


edit: reminded me of [this](https://youtu.be/XvyRIgPImOY)
$C: I wonder who you expect to do that? The current administration would be the most likely to do that considering the constant negative reporting. But they won't, because attempting to do so will just end up with the media painting it as an "attack on the media and journalism".

Vote for the opposite side, Democrats, and why exactly would they change it either? It works in their favor. 
$C: There's an uphill battle. The end of the Fairness Doctrine, and some highly effective and shameless propaganda.
$C: Only for them to turn victim into the exact thing they were elected to break down
$C: How do you break them up, though? How does the government legally take someone's company and force them to make it into smaller ones?
$C: God I keep forgetting to register
$C: if you vote outside of the 2 big parties then maybe but both Dems and Republicans are neocon trash
$C: Will only work when voters start voting third party and stop voting the same ideology that has plagued democrats and republicans party for decades. 
$C: Which candidates are going to break the conglomerates?  Are there /any/ serious candidates in the last 30 years that have uttered the words "Let's break up the monopolies"
$C: If you plan on voting for a Democrat or Republican you're not changing shit
$C: Those conglomerates are America 

Nobody you vote for will do anything against them 
$C: When was the last time your saw a politician run on a platform of breaking up media conglomerates?  
$C: They'll just run to Europe Asia south America. Globalism bro. 
$C: Good fuckin luck with that
$C: The naivete is strong with this one.
$C: Its pretty hopeless when the choices of whos running are a list of corrupt politicians.  Destroying comcast by making AT&T bigger, or getting healthcare but losing medical choice in the process.  I will be voting in 2018, but I don't believe for a minute that anything will get better.  We are on the long slide to despotism, and its a question of how long will it take.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
$C: Correct. The powers that be couldn’t careless about complaints but action? Let’s give that a shot
$C: The only way to win this war is to vote with our wallets. 

That’s all these people want. Our work and our pay. 
$C: Someone like Sanders?
$C: So... are you voting for the party that promotes the interests of big business, or the party that promotes the interests of big business? Choices, choices
$C: >  We can vote for people who will break up these big media conglomerates, i.e. Comcast, Sinclair group, etc

> Also the Kochs, among others

So all of the people fighting Trump?

Are you telling Reddit to fight its own narrative now?
$C: Nobody will break this up. The money flows into the seat, not the person. Whoever sits in the seat gets the money, bro. Nothing is going to change.
$C: No we can't because that is no-ones agenda.
$C: >  We can vote

Oh come off it. You need to do more than vote. I'm sick of hearing people bring that up on its own. Like any meaningful change in the history of any democracy has involved people voting as the core of their resistance to something awful. If the political system actually worked all by itself they wouldn't be buying up media outlets to manage opinion.

You need a movement that relies on more than just voting as its purpose. I thought people celebrated holidays every year dedicated to activism that had more on its plat than voter registration drives.
$C: Our votes no longer matter, we should just enjoy life as we know it now before it gets too fucked up.
$C: Sadly I think this more of an economic elite vs plebian issue and not so much left vs right.

Remember Bernie’s message on “rigged economy”. ... this message was silenced and instead we have a corporate okayed message of bigots, migrants and guns 

$C: No we can’t, they’re all the fucking same mate 
$C: It's too late. Voting does not work anymore.

[source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tu32CCA_Ig)
$C: I agree.  Speak up let your voice be heard, VOTE!  This we haven’t seen unrest like this since the Vietnam war protests.
$C: Difficult to find such candidates when the big conglomerates donate the vast majority of campaign contributions
$C: I wonder (((who))) owns these stations and pushes the urgent concern for dying (((democracy))).
$C: Lol. In lieu of what? They’re all corrupt, they’re all scum. 
$C: > It's not hopeless. We can vote for people who will break up these big media conglomerates, i.e. Comcast, Sinclair group, etc. The midterms are coming up in November.

You don't really get it do you? It doesn't matter which of the political parties you vote for. It really doesn't make a difference. Watch The Mechanism on Netflix, real corruption in Brazil has finally been exposed to the point where they can't just  gaslight you and call you a conspiracy theorist anymore. All political parties are in on it.

You live in a world of fancy if you think it isn't the same here in America. 

Voting really doesn't matter. You have to remove the criminal organizations you call political parties and institute some sort of Constitutional Military Rule, because Brazil went corrupt the INSTANT Military handed over power to "democracy". 

Militant anti-corruption, and any news outside corporate controlled media, is "extremely dangerous to our democracy" because the democracy is just a big corrupt system that depends on voters CONSENTING to be ruled by corruption via casting a vote. 

Even if you vote in a few "good guys" who aren't corrupt, they will either be marginalized and totally ineffective, or the establishment will just entrap them into some sort of perjury or whatever bullshit they can get them in trouble for and blackmail them to play along.

You either accept that nothing will change, or you man up and call for military rule/remove and replace the civilian government and hope you get some philosopher king.

You guys need to stop falling for the charismatic speakers. Put the quiet one who has been bullied all their life in charge.
$C: The Democrats took more money from telecoms companies at the last election.
Comcast and Time Warner gave them a lot of money. More than all other campaigns combined.

https://www.mediaite.com/online/telecom-giants-have-overwhelmingly-donated-to-hillary-clinton/amp/

http://amp.timeinc.net/time/money/4237383/hillary-clinton-big-cable-lobby-money

Comcast also held fundraisers for Clinton and Obama.

Bill Clinton signed the Telecommunications act in 1996 that deregulated the media market and allowed large corporations to start monopolising media reach as seen in this video.

The solution to this problem is people getting involved in the Democratic Party and trying to take it back through it’s selections of candidates so that the people can have a party that fights for them again.

Right now there’s not much difference in policy on many issues between Democrats and Republicans.
Certainly not when it comes to media.
$C: Real eyes realize real lies.
$C: Shit, come get this one boys, it's another Droid starting to question their existence! 
$C: It doesn't have to be! Vote in the 2018 midterms this November. Vote for politicians who will support antitrust legislation. Vote like our democracy depends on it - cause it does!
$C: Is this just fantasy?
$C: Yeah but how can I act like NOW is more worsererer then yesterday??!
$C: Season 2?????
$C: Chill dude. We are. Takes time as elections take time. 
$C: I think it's that attitude that got us here now. People keep doing that and don't pay attention.  
  
Go vote in your locals, go vote in every ballot you get. Equally importantly, educate yourself on the issues, people. Read the blue books that get mailed, or pick one up from the local elections office. Participate in council meetings.
$C: That's what they want us to do. They're counting on us doing just that. Eventually, enjoying life in blissful ignorance either won't be an option or will be the only option. 
$C: With the current SC makeup, I wish you well but I doubt you'll do it.

Even 2 or 3 of the liberal justices seem to be pro-corp.
$C: Does that defeatist attitude serve you well in life?

Voting has consequences. Choosing people who push to protect consumers does actually work and vice versa. Hence why Obama's FCC enacted the Title II net neutrality regulations to keep the internet open to all and Trump's FCC just repealed net neutrality.

$C: Government created monopolies is not capitalism. That is a socialism for the 99.9% and capitalism for the .1% that we are living in.
$C: *Please keep your hands inside the car*
$C: I don't know, but did you see what Trump tweeted? 
$C: But I like that game. :(
$C: All of which, are American dreams.
$C: Apparently theres a larger risk of the tooth falling out than debris hitting him in this case. He did this dangerous spin up this one time, other times he just spins up the shaft, (no bar). This usually applies to other people.


This is still dangerous though, which makes me even more mad at the robotic death company. Yeah they didnt have the attatchable part of the tooth on (iirc) but thats a 45 KG steel shell spinning at 1400 RPM. You are asking for a pebble to hit your eyes.

$C: Gotta catch 'em all.
$C: Plus he had to watch a bunch of Fox News!
$C: Very well done.  And when they aren't spewing the same coordinated narrative to mass manipulate, they are creating division and confusion by targeting areas with conflicting information. We don't call them FAKE NEWS for nothing.  https://imgur.com/a/pS9EI

Edit: It's the date to show that they were released on the same day, and then the WSJ published them to different regions, giving readers a different impression based on where they live. And this is some of the reason why Democrats and Republicans are so geographically based, they're getting lied to differently.
$C: That's what took the longest time. Editing it is easy.
$C: Almost as if whoever made this had some kind of access to all the clips.  Maybe The Man's throwin' us a bone, or rubbing our nose in it.  Hard to tell which.  Probably the latter.

$C: The irony is that Sinclair gets their data from Sorenson who in turn gets their analytical data from the same company as critical mention . I hated working at that place.

$C: i think this is the second time TODAY i've seen this clip plugged in response to a post about the shit sinclair is pulling. i think that's why i'm less disturbed by the OP than others seem to be - i'm not surprised, i already knew it was happening, but the fact that sinclair's script itself is criticizing exactly what sinclair is doing is... i'm not sure what the right word is but that's what caught my attention the most.
$C: A close friend of mine just told me to watch this John Oliver clip when I showed them OPs clip... 


This is legitimately scary stuff.
$C: Careful you're going to trigger a certain group of snowflakes by mentioning a liberal comedian like that.

$C: [No bullshit. They do this a lot. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_Broadcast_Group#Must-run_segments)

$C: Many redditor support "it is their site they can do whatever they want including censorship" notion.
$C: Fair use doesn't really matter on YouTube. They serve takedown requests from media companies immediately and don't even ask questions later.

At least it is sure to be rehosted elsewhere.

$C: What??? Can you hook a fellow redditor up? That sounds awesome!
$C: You haven't stared into the void long enough.
$C: I don't watch American TV, but surely they must have some semblance. I figure that on national stories they're all following a script, but they can't all be reporting the same local stories. That wouldn't make sense.
$C: And you're saying that as a blatant conservative. That's saying something. You guys are usually proud of doing shit like this.
$C: It is just a sad indictment of the groupthink of Reddit.
$C: Most cities in Canada have local stations owned and operated by local people (or at least used to. A lot of them have gone under, which should tell you all you need to know about your prediction) Major networks outperform them pretty significantly.  The exception is CBC, but that's not there because of the free market. Quite the contrary.

Better anchors, better production etc etc costs money, and the network with the money to invest in that is going to trounce the local station ten times out of ten.

This is a poor choice to extol the virtues of the free market, because it borders on impossible to topple incumbents, and even neglecting that once you have a financial leader it very easily snowballs. 
$C: > If you were given the choice of watching this or a local station owned/operated by local people what would you watch?

These are local stations. The budgets for the local affiliates comes from the network affiliation, the name recognition from national ad campaigns in local markets (cars, fast food, etc), and the local ad campaigns sold by Acct Execs (fancy named sales folks at local TV/radio stations) who pound the pavement daily to pester local businesses into coughing up ad dollars. 

Even if a station is local owned/operated, they don't have nearly the power, bankroll, or access that the big 4 have (ABC/CBS/NBC/FOX affiliates.) The talent, the gear, the graphics, the wire subscriptions, the NSI subscriptions, the personnel, the licensing, the hardware maintenance...

Do you have any idea how much a single Panasonic P2 costs? How about a microwave truck and receiver? 
$C: That implies that a small local station could afford to not be fucked up in a free market, which it can't.
$C: [deleted]
$C: It's not just one PSA, it's a campaign of similar messaging throughout their broadcast as well. 

Look up the reports on the well-documented must runs and don't be so quick to brush this off.

I used to work in local news - what they're doing, NO other outlet does.
$C: Wave your hands in the air like you’re hyper aware
$C: Let's make them care! Vote in the midterms this November! We need new antitrust legislation. We need a Consumer's Bill of Rights to prevent this bullshit from happening! 

$C: This is a thing, though. Is it just me or did big corporations at some point drop the "we're not actually doing anything wrong" act and now they pull their nefarious shit in broad daylight with a "what the fuck are you gonna do about it?" attitude?

I mean, the shit that Facebook pulls would have gotten them pulled in front of Congress not long ago. Now it's like, whatever.

EDIT - clarification, I know Facebook is getting pulled in front of Congress. But it seems like more of a reaction to public outcry than an actual attempt at reigning their bullshit in.
$C: Why would JERRY bring anything?
$C: We have always lived in a oligarchy, disguised as a democracy.

$C: Created by Team Coco for the Conan show. And then, in the video description it says: "Fake news goes so much deeper... This video was created by The Truth Movement"

Ironic.
$C: You know the rest.
$C: Mine's been filled with cheese
$C: no different than the brainwashed CTR crowd. shitty democrats elected Trump just as much as his horrible supporters.
$C: Erm... yes, [they were forced to in these clips](http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/07/media/sinclair-broadcasting-promos-media-bashing/index.html):

> The instructions to local stations say that the promos "should play using news time, not commercial time." Like the Epshteyn commentaries, this takes away from local news time.

> **"Please produce the attached scripts exactly as they are written,"** the instructions say. "This copy has been thoroughly tested and speaks to our Journalistic Responsibility as advocates to seek the truth on behalf of the audience."

They even have very explicit dress codes to adhere to while delivering this propaganda:

> "Talent should dress in jewel tones -- however they should not look political in their dress or attire," one of the documents says. "Avoid total red, blue and purples dresses and suits. Avoid totally red, blue and purple ties, **the goal is to look apolitical, neutral, nonpartisan yet professional.** Black or charcoal suits for men...females should wear yellow, gold, magenta, cyan, but avoid red, blue or purple."

Not only that, they very deliberately want to separate these anchors from their audience, and basically have corporate impersonate these anchors online, while still maintaining all that local credibility:

> At the end of the promo, viewers are encouraged to send in feedback "if you believe our coverage is unfair."

> The instructions say that **"corporate will monitor the comments and send replies to your audience on your behalf."**

> In other words, local stations are cut out of the interactions with viewers. Management will handle it instead.

So why think the worst? Because the worst has happened here, and it's been thoroughly documented.
$C: > Why think the worst when there could be a simpler reason?

Because they have a history of doing this.  They are called must-runs.

$C: Fake news are objectively bad and not a matter of discussion
$C: You should be higher
$C: There needs to be an investigation of this guy and the entire FCC conduct over the last 18 months.  Mueller style, thorough investigation into the entire event.  Disregarded 97% of the organic comments.  There's no clearer evidence of a quid pro quo than Ajit Pai's actions.
$C: Oh you silly liberals with all your facts and fancy science. FAKE NEWS! YOU ELITIST WILL NEVER GET US UHMERIKKKANS TO GIVE UP DA GUNZ OR TELL ME WHAT TO THINK! SHOW ME PROOF! FOX NEWS SAYS U ALL LIE! FUHRER tRUMP IS RIGHT!


/sarcasm
$C: Or shell companies whose ownership feeds right back up to the heads of Sinclair. They're about to sell some recently-acquired channels to a car dealership in Maryland which is owned by... Them!
$C: Unless dems take back the house and senate and reverse pajidiots rulings and return things to the way they were or ensures that Sinclair has to put stations up for bidding and as blue states are the wealthiest they could very quickly reverse this dangerous trend..
$C: LOL, taking 'antitrust' seriously in the Trump administration. 

I bet you're a riot at parties!
$C: SBGI is a public company. They will have to sell to the buyers that represent the shareholder’s best interests (almost certainly highest bidder) or will face significant lawsuits. FWIW, they’ve been trading sideways for years and are 25% off their 52 week high. This isn’t a healthy company, I wouldn’t worry too much.      
Edit: the “family” mentioned owns less than 10% of the equity from a quick lookup. Could be other classes, options, etc. but this isn’t a closely held enterprise. 
$C: Conservative-friendly =/= Sinclair. 

If you can reliably name 2 other "conservative-friendly", non-O&O groups that have stations in more than 5 markets, go for it. 
$C: Shit, we're fucked
$C: Underrated comment.
$C: It's almost as if that's a decoy.  
$C: *Face palm*
$C: The problem is that people think that Local stations are being directed how to report and operate by FOX - not to mention NBC, ABC, or CBS.

Even the O&O's don't have "must-runs" like Sinclair mandates. 


$C: That's exactly the point, sadly. 
$C: I guess your perception is skewed. 
$C: Everyone is a little bit biased, but monopolies are not good for anyone.
$C: >  at al

Even though you're a moronic right-wing drone, I still feel the need to help you out:

$C: How ?

$C: > Well yeah, local radio has been dead in the water for at least a decade.

Local *music* radio is failing, talk/sports radio is doing just fine. It is the listen to the same songs everyday stations that are failing. For example, Cumulus, one of the largest radio conglomerates is losing money hand over fist on their music stations but staying somewhat afloat by all their sports and talk stations. Most of their problems were buying stations on their highs with loans that are coming due in a down market. 

 No one listens to the radio for music, but the radio is a must if you like any sort of talk.
$C: I am so proud of a local non-profit radio station that plays in my hometown area. They play music nonstop that I have never heard of.. shit that you can't even Shazam because it's so uncommon. They keep it real as fuck. Only play advertisements once in a great while, and the ads are usually presented in a way that is entertaining.

I've never come across as good of a radio station. I feel blessed to have it in my home town 
$C: Wait so you’re getting Sirius from your phone?
$C: By the time that radios normally had aux or line in jacks, people were already looking to escape radio.  
$C: So, coming back from a trip to Nashville recently, we were listening to “Nash FM”. Ok, local Nashville radio station. Then in Bowling Green (never forget)...Nash FM. Then in Louisville...Nash FM. Then in Cincinnati...Nash FM. Four different Nash FMs, four different radio stations, SAME MUSIC AND DJS. It was surreal. 
$C: Jokes on him. I only listen to public radio.
$C: I really wish my aux cord still worked(my ex broke off a male 3.5 into the female port and it wont come out). But yeah, the radio is just *absolute trash* now. Like, pop music used to atleast have unique songs, even going back like 10 years ago, and now its all the same crap over and over it seems. Everyone sounds the same. Even the rap kids are listening to nowadays is just idiots stoned on xanax doing triplets over and over again instead of having an actual flow. I just listen to podcasts on my ipod nowadays. 
$C: Wrong!

Clear Channel is iHeartRadio now.
$C: Formerly known as "Clear Channel"
$C: My FM oldies station plays clips from fox news, and is *very* right wing when they talk about politics. I just normally change the station when they do it, because the oldies station is the only one in town that plays something other than trash. 
$C: It's treason then. 
$C: We negotiate the terms of surrender
$C: Not officially.
$C: Sinclair Broadcast group has 200 stations across 80 different markets. It took decades to get where we are now, and it will take many more to fix this, if ever.
$C: All the other stations are still reporting narratives approved by the 1%.  I dont see how it helps the Sinclair oligarchs when I tell people to stop following all corporate-approved information, and watch reputable, established independent-creators.

If you want me to give good attacks on MSNBC, then I can do that too man, I got good examples.  They give the people shit-information on events.
$C: >bias

Agreed.  Some creators do good at trying to check their bias as they cover a story.

>leave print media to die, and cut the cord

These are business models that seem to fail/heavily decline with the rise of the internet.  Only print media I used as a child was game informer, now they can email it to me.

>We pirate, skip commercials

Seems to be the people resisting the corporate status quo.  People don't want to buy the expensive package to watch a few shows.  Once Netflix came, pirating declined; one paid service for all (or majority) of your content, no commercials. If you pay for a product, you don't want commercials.  Imagine commercials at the movie theater, played mid-movie.

And we can't simply blame the peoples' laziness to not support small business; must also mention some business (ex. amazon) operating at a net-loss, so the competition goes under (Barnes & Nobles) and only after that time, consider opening their own physical book store.

Hard to blame the people for supporting Wal Mart, when new employees are shown how to get welfare because they won't make enough to support themselves, and will obviously shop Wal Mart and not small business because prices.

Independent media seems sustainable enough to some creators via patreon & chat donation whilst they stream their show; seems like they make more than me.  We have the small creators already, people just need to stop treating CNN, MSNBC (Comcast), FOX, ABC/CBS (Sinclair) as credible, and unsubscribe

> The flip side, of course, is that if we weren't still being "told" what we like to consume, we wouldn't be looking elsewhere. Print, radio, and traditional television have not adapted.

Print, radio, and traditional television have not adapted what their bias narrative because its still one of 6 companies.  Its to the individual, to subscribe to lefty, centrist, and right independent news shows if they want to be exposed to all the biased-views/positions.  Its hard if not impossible for someone to deliver facts, and then they talk about it and give their opinion.  Is that not how all news-shows work.
$C: Depends. If you’re in a smaller city news is usually a bit better. The larger the city, the larger the slant they’ll put on their reporting. 
$C: KOMO at least USED to air the prerecorded segments at 4am on weekends when no one would see them. Apparently they’ve been told to stop that. 
$C: Working in national TV, we laugh at how much tension the locals have with eachother 
$C: I trust you. In my town the only English station was started up locally way back in the day, but over time they got bought up like Monopoly. 
$C: Not at all. This existed long before him and many others. Not sure why your link about what is currently happening has any significance. It's not like this just happened because of Ajit pai.
$C: Good for you, dude! I've been donating more than ever to them as well. They also have a thing called PBS Passport which is its on demand streaming service of most of their collection

$C: I was referring to radio more than web.  From a single snapshot of headlines, doesn't look bad, though.
$C: Yeah I can't fault their reporting style at all.  Listening to Rush or Hannity, the tone of voice itself makes you want to be angry about something, whether you agree with them or not.

Listening to NPR is calming.  You have to pay attention to how they report things to be mad about the slant.  Makes great background noise if you can tune it out.   They have not lost their touch on soothing talk radio.
$C: Like, you know NBC Nightly News with now Lester Holt? It airs at 6:30p eastern. It’s NBC’s newscast, usually with the national big headlines, but it only lasts a half hour (really, about 22 minutes, not counting commercials), so they don’t go super in-depth on topics daily (that’s where shows like CBS’s 60 Minutes comes in). So, the network, NBC, has that. 

But around that, usually starting at 5p, the local stations, like the 200 or whatever that Sinclair owns, or even the two that Wolf-Dispatch owns, create their own newscasts lasting until that 6:30p start. These local newscasts may have NBC’s peacock logo in the corner, and may feature a lower level national correspondent in some faraway place (like if a hurricane hits), but mostly show local reporters and anchors delivering stories about that particular city. They don’t work for NBC, their contracts are paid by Sinclair or whoever. They’ve also likely had zero interaction with Lester Holt. 

A lot of the far off but not BIG stories you see in that newscast are provided by file-sharing subscription services, or company-wide file sharing services (so like from Sinclair sister stations). So, these stations will subscribe to the AP, Newspath, or something called CNN Newsource (which is different that the 24/7 CNN that people hate on). For these, a subscribing station in Boise uploads a story they did locally. It’s of a cute baby cow. The 5pm producer in Memphis needs a cute story to end on a positive note, and their station subscribed to the same service as Boise, so that producer downloads it and put it in the show. No one needed to physically go to Boise except the reporters already there. The information is usually agenda-less and about as accurate as it could be, because of Boise screws up and Memphis airs falsehoods, Boise will get in trouble or kicked out of the service, which means Boise will have a hard time getting elsewhere stories. 

It’s not a matter of laziness, it’s just spreading the info around and filling time and then budgets (it costs quite a bit to fly a crew from Memphis to Boise to get a story about a cow). Some ownership groups have set up bureaus in like DC or state capitols to help the smaller lower budget stations get political news on those levels and keep their viewership informed. 

Now here’s the danger of what Sinclair is doing: If the Boise station is a Sinclair station, and they put up some horribly slanted nonsense story on the Newspath/Newsource/AP servers, and the non-Sinclair Memphis station looks at it to run it, what do they do? DO they run it? Is it truthful? Can Boise be trusted and taken at their word? Will Sinclair poison these wells? 

As far as the networks, if Sinclair owns a NBC affiliate and the viewers get pissed enough at the content, I’m sure they could complain loudly to the network until they’ve had enough, and then they pull that station’s affiliation agreement. But there’s 200 of these things, 80 markets, so that’s 80 cities that won’t see Law & Order SVU or whatever. You can watch them online, sure, but rural areas don’t have that luxury as much, and a lot of Sinclair’s stations so far have been smaller markets which means more rural areas. 

And, eventually Sinclair can just shrug them off and develop their own content for just THEIR stations and make the SIN network or something. Prime time dramas about evil hippies and Red Dawn movie nights...or monster truck racing.

$C: Bell owns like 90% of the channels and radio stations in Canada. CBC is one of the few exceptions. I also live in SK so Sasktel is the dominant service providers but recently Bell has been rearing their head into the market here.

$C: because those conglomerates also own the government. nuff said. 
$C: Maybe for TV, but between Murdoch and Dacre our print media is corrupt as fuck.  
Not to mention that exactly one year from today we're going to walk out of the world's largest economic bloc thanks largely to decades of misrepresentation by the media.

$C: Educate. That's what we as a society need to focus on the absolute most beyond just political participation. More funding to schools and higher learning. Mandatory middle school classes on the basics of a fucking computer. There's so much knowledge on the internet, you can learn to do nearly anything and most people are so hesitant to venture beyond social networks.
$C: stockpile arms in the event that fails.

$C: For sure, we need to get the word out, we need to educate others as best we can. I'm tired of the consequences of others poor choices. Time to start progress again.
$C: Is it really the best way though? Voting is important and perhaps the strongest built-in tool our government gives us to interact with them, but it feels like voters are becoming increasingly disenfranchised. 

We vote directly for state and local officials, and representative legislators from the states, everything else is hired, appointed, or picked by electoral college. 

What we do vote for directly is subject to incredible amounts of confusion, political predation, and flat out corruption. If they're not running a business or a mob, they're probably gerrymandering. 

The laws that people have to vote on are often geared to fool the reader, or have some secondary agenda hidden in the pages. This is only what they bother to get our input on. 

I want to believe in voting, in having a system where everyone can have a say in government and be heard to a reasonable extent, but I feel like for every 1 person that cares and hunts down change or the truth, there are 10 people who care enough to vote and 100 who don't even know when any election except for the presidency is run. 

I'm begging you, anyone, please show me that I'm wrong. 
$C: Dump your TV. Propaganda is less effective if you cant hear it.
$C: I'm so amused you think you can vote this out. They've been slowly paving the way for this shit the entire time. It is a systemic societal problem at this point.
$C: Voting will do nothing in America because the two party system has been created to inhibit the needed change. Get off your teams and break the chains of the two party system if you truly want change to occur. Also, remove the idea that corporations are people because they are not. 
$C: > The best way to do that is to vote. 

Except theyre all sides of the same coin. Unfortunately its too late, and just pretty much like always, passive means of change dont work.  
  
Violence causes change, its the one constant in history.
$C: It's cute you think voting will stop this.  
$C: Voting is the minimum you can do. Our profoundly undemocratic and non-transparent voting system renders change by vote extremely difficult and unlikely, but it's still important. Grass roots coalition building, direct action, and especially boycotts are far more effective.  
$C: Lol, look at this guy who still believes in voting
$C: Those are rigged too ya damn foolish sheep
$C: Democracy is the cruel and corrupt system that causes this. America never should have left the British Empire. 
$C: And what reason could a socialist have to focus more on concentrated power of the state, instead of too much power in the hands of private entities? It is not as if Orwell was such a fan of corporations, so he must have had a reason to focus on government tyranny.
$C: No, reasonable people think it's a good idea to take an objective look at the problem and apply reasonable regulations to reduce the countless murders of innocent American citizens.
$C: Such as? Ar-15s?
$C: But are you and others actually willing to use your 2nd amendment to protect the other amendments?
$C: No, we need to vote for people who will regulate media companies and prevent monopolies like this one from happening. We can begin in November of 2018!
$C: Russian Propaganda Worker, are you actually actively agitating for the overthrow of the American government via violent insurrection in a public forum?
$C: yes protect your first by killing your local news anchor
$C: Is that not allowed?
$C: You have no fucking idea what the 2nd amendment does and doesn't allow. Stop acting like you do.
$C: OMG, some retired dude has an opinion?! Stop the presses!
$C: We should all be much more furious that the NRA has managed to twist popular opinion so much that this ridiculous new view of the 2nd is seen as "the Founding Fathers' original intent".  Look, I'm all for the Living Constitution, but at least acknowledge that it's a recent interpretation.
$C: lol. the majority of historic judges would be against the current reading of the second. 
$C: Anyone who still supports Trump and his empty WH is most definitely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: How so?

Willing to hear you out, don't blow your chance.
$C: What? Lol if you can't put 2 and 2 together then you must not follow politics too much.
$C: Well fortunately we have the internet now and it won't be as easy for these arrogant pricks to play the same games.
$C: How is that relevant to this discussion?
$C: No, that's not true. You're a child murderers if you kill children. You're a child murderer enabler if you don't support more sensible regulations on gun control.
$C: It is the beginning, it might not be facist propaganda just yet, but it's turning into that. Take it to the extreme and what do you get? That's what happens when it goes unchecked.
$C: Controlling the popular narrative with a single family owned media conglomerate is exactly how fascist propaganda spreads. 
$C: [removed]
$C: Ya already know!
$C: Double plus upvote
$C: /r/PerfectTiming
$C: Even if that were true, how is that relevant to this discussion?
$C: Also, vote for people who believe in government regulations and also to give government regulation bodies the teeth/power to enforce it. 
$C: Yeah, it's not like small time news sources could fool nearly half of Americans into voting for a disgusting pig of a human being with repugnant beliefs and a clear lack of intellect into the highest office in the government! 
$C: To call it Orwellian because they use the same script to report on news stories? It's weird and dumb, it's not Orwellian. Using the same script to talk about social media isn't remotely close to the beginning of an Orwellian society. It's just stupid to say that.
$C: The people that ask why we need regulation are usually the ones benefiting from deregulation.
$C: Similarly it's pretty much the same thing with anti-vaxxers.
$C: Oh god it’s like working in tech support. 
$C: Scurvy was “discovered” dozens of times throughout history.  Solved problems just poof into smoke!
$C: It's like how way back in the day ships always had a store of fruits to combat scurvy, then after a long period, people forgot about scurvy and forgot why they stocked fruit on voyages, so they stopped bringing it.  
Then people started getting scurvy again and it took a while to figure out that fruit was the cure. 
$C: Shh, you're giving away the GOP agenda.
$C: it seems like a human problem to be honest. history repeating itself and stuff.

$C: Why is this stupid load-bearing wall here?
$C: Kind of reminds me of the [Kyklos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyklos). It's scary how relevant this still is..
$C: This guy regulates.
$C: The housing market is great right now. Why do we need stupid Dodd-Frank slowing down our mortgage industry?  
$C: We keep showing that, left to our own devices, we can’t behave ourselves, then complain when we get rules.
$C: In this instance, the people asking why we need the regulations were the corporations in control of Trump's FCC, tuning out the very loud voices telling them the regulations were still needed. They halfheartedly pretend to care about procedure, but Pai gets to laugh the whole time.
$C: That’s how vaccines work. People think we don’t need them because hardly anybody gets measles any more. 
$C: I hate how common this logic is. And why so many people keep falling for it.

Banks, Telecommunications, EPA, Hell the goddamn supreme court even did this with the voting rights act.

A vicious cycle. 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy 
$C: Well put. 
$C: > People ask why we need the regulation because there is no problem.

Except instead of this step, it's simply the other party getting into power and the national conversation looking the other way for a minute.

Same with the EPA. Same with FCPB. Over and over.
$C: Oh boy no, no folks no. 1996 telecommunications act is what did this. SINCE THE ACT it has become increasingly MORE EXPENSIVE for news outlets, radio stations, you name it to meet all the regulations. The result is that they were bought up by conglomerate media.
This was covered every semester in my communication classes when we briefed on media first week. 
It was then promoted in every text book to be a good thing because "conglomerates can afford diversity" 

So in reality, pushing for even more regulation is what they want you to do. 

It's when you take back the regulations that allow for individuals to more easily start their own news agencies ( IM LOOKING AT YOU FCC)  that this shit goes away. 

DO NOT GET IT CONFUSED. 

Edit: you can downvote me, that's fine. But it doesn't make it any less true. Controlled opposition is very much a thing, you may believe you're radical pushing for regulation, but you are very much the opposite. 
$C: Regulations create monopolies. I'm not saying free markets are the only solution.

Reddit constantly points out correctly that big businesses write laws, then says we need more regulations because of big businesses. 
$C: There is a problem

Regulation is enacted that was written by the companies being regulated.

Different problems crop up.

Companies scream were to big to fail.  



Look at airlines, does anybody want to go back to the good old regulated airlines.  I just flew to Hawaii for 500 bucks.  I love deregulation.  
$C: No, they care about you as a consumer. The problem is that they don’t give a fuck about you as a citizen and as a person.
$C: Thing is they never did. Money is all they care about.
$C: They want to deregulate us back to the robber baron era. 
$C: How about consumers start to care about their consumption?
$C: Trump's tax plan already locked in the next recession.  We are just waiting for it to drop.
$C: But this IS capitalism.  It is called a trough, and it is the lowest point of the business cycle.  And it is expected.  Not only will the next recession happen with certainty, it is EXPECTED.  It is fundamental to capitalism.
$C: Regulation does not prevent recession. Recessions are a natural part of the economic cycle. Regulation and government tampering with the economy is what prolongs recessions. FDR and his New Deal programs are what caused the Great Depression to last 10 years.
$C: Why would they want deregulation when they are able to do this right now? Deregulation would give more competition.

$C: > But the internet is absolutely a better source of news than television, if for no other reason than you can dig in and fact-check, look up sources and investigate further.

The internet though has a disadvantage. Search engines cater to the habits of its user, so even if you "look for the facts" it will likely direct you to "facts" that support your bias rather than from a non partisan source.
$C: if you're the type of person who takes a Facebook news feed at face value, then you're the type of person who doesn't bother to fact check. unfortunately there's a lot of those.
$C: The thing is, we shouldn't have to research for the facts. The news should be giving us the facts..
$C: And then find out the study is bull-shit as it wasn’t peer-reviewed and had many methodological problems.

Then you get mad at why people are even reporting such nonsense.
$C: > But the internet is absolutely a better source of news than television, if for no other reason than you can dig in and fact-check, look up sources and investigate further.

Unfortunately, in the time it takes you to do this, the Liars and Spinmasters have spun up multiple new narratives and caused so much noise in the signal, that whatever actual legit facts you found will be drowned out and forgotten. 

This exact dynamic plays out on Reddit all the time. You research facts and start writing up a nice well-documented Comment,.. and before you can click Submit,.. the conversation has moved on and your factual substance gets buried at the bottom.
$C: According to unnamed sources familiar with the thinking of x person, etc...
$C: I just finished the book Fantasyland: How American Went Haywire. It goes over americas penchant for believing in quackery and conspiracy theories from colonial times up to today. It argues that this problem has gotten totally out of hand the last 30 years or so, and we've reached a point where there simply is no "reality" anymore, just whatever people believe the world to be, complete with their own facts. Very enlightening, and very disturbing book.

Hell, toss 'language' into that too.

TV News like this doesn't 'deserve' trust because Sinclair broadcasting group has a specific 'journalistic' intent to spread one particular ideology, it's Roger Ailes' template for Fox News on steroids. [Ailes had been planning that with Nixon back in the 70s](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/richard-nixon-and-roger-ailes-1970s-plan-to-put-the-gop-on-tv/2011/07/01/AG1W7XtH_blog.html?utm_term=.3043d11dda02). 

So then what would 'news' like Fox and Sinclair intending to do?  Nixon, for his part, **HATED** the Washington Post.  Something to do with the whole [Pentagon Papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_Papers) thing.

[Oliver North](https://theintercept.com/2017/12/04/trump-white-house-weighing-plans-for-private-spies-to-counter-deep-state-enemies/) and Erik Prince are said to be teaming up to lobby Trump to combat the 'deep state' (as they put it) but what the fuck is Oliver North if not a god damn traitor?  And who exactly saw fit to put that guy on television again after [Iran Contra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair)? (reported by outlets like the [NYT](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/1125.html#article))

You already know the answer.  It was our buddy Roger Ailes at Fox News.

These people have worked for **years** to erode the trust in media and treat their fake fantasy land as equivalent to reality.

If you can't trust anyone then lies are equal to the truth, there's no cost at all to lying.  "Oh all sides are biased so it's ok".  That's fundamentally dangerous.

That's how crackpots like alex jones get treated seriously enough to get phone calls by the fucking POTUS.

Everything is 'biased' by perspective, **any** piece of media.  At all.  Entertainment or informative.  I was watching [this](https://youtu.be/URIpoQFbnpI) video last night, which is probably incredibly boring to you but I wanted to see some more brine pool submersible footage after seeing some bbc videos.

The BBC videos were clips from Planet Earth.  They have a *very* different descriptive style from scientists talking over each other in a submersible.  The ideas they were trying to get you to think about were different.

That's not to say the BBC videos are 'propaganda and social conditioning', I mean, they do have a different *intent*, but that's also because they have a different *audience*, few people care enough to listen to scientists droll on about 'salt tectonics' and sediment deposit in the gulf of Mexico.

But people **do** care about the diversity of life and the extremes life can survive at.  BBC comes at it from that perspective.

There is no 'social conditioning free' piece of media.  Recognizing that doesn't mean abstaining from everything at all.

Just some due diligence required to *think* about what you're looking at.

To bring it back to the OP... should you trust anything owned by Sinclair?  What are their motives?  What is their history?  What is their particular 'journalistic slant'?  How did it form?

These are far more important than blanket statements like "don't trust TV news, it's been used as propaganda from the start". 
$C: True, around 200 stations.
$C: And it's spreading like a cancer
$C: Yeah but while this is disturbing, most local news is important to communities. Not to mention most elderly get all their news from it. My locals news is considered one of the best in the country (Birmingham) and its owned by Sinclair. Yet Ive never seen them act on biased towards one way or another. If anything they are considered liberal because they actually show negative news about our government in Alabama. Even Trump stuff too.
$C: Yes but chances are they own one station in a market of two to four others. There are alternatives.
$C: All media companies have their own political lean and bias, but most don't actually give marching orders on political topics.  And I've never known Nexstar or Gannett to have must-runs.
$C: Do you have evidence of other media owners handing out scripted political talking points to their stations?
$C: > misinformed and manipulated by Murdoch and Co.

You know that Sinclair and Murdoch's enterprises are separate and do not cooperate with each other, right? 

Sinclair makes Fox News Channel look downright left-wing by contrast. Sinclair is attempting to take Fox's "alternative" viewpoint approach to the local level...and cranked up to 11. 
$C: So then TV news deserves to die because of it? That's like saying all pitbulls should be killed because one pitbull bit a kid.

>if something big happens, you'll hear about it no matter what.

Don't be so sure. This about how many people went to the polls in 2016 an voted on misinformation. Hell there's big news items that happened this week that you probably didn't hear about. TV news, when used properly, informs and unites people. 
$C: Trickle down economics was the greatest fuckup in American history.

$C: Zack and the boys have got a movement, a cause, and a world calling out for it!!!! 
$C: I'm well aware...wasn't saying he was dead, more of a poke at The Prophets of Rage.
$C: See, no i think theres a critical flaw here that needs to be addressed. It *started going down hill* a loooooong time ago. We're well past "going downhill" now. I think this thing is broken. I dont honestly believe there is a clean way to fix it. This business will get out of hand and more people will die before it gets better.

the problem lies within the sinclair group. theres a difference between everyone reporting the same story, and having everyone under your umbrella rehearsing propaganda lines, you'd do well to learn the difference.

Your opinions are trite and useless, like most of your ilk.
$C: It's like, how all those kingdoms failed because of inbreeding.

Trump is the inbred.
$C: Yet they don't pay him enough to visit a dentist.
$C: Sinclair makes Fox News look left-wing by comparison, and they own a big chunk of the local news in this country. They're trying to merge with Tribune in order to control the majority of it. So yeah, this *is* an ultra-conservative news outlet that most people don't even know exists.
$C: Shelby is a girls name 100% and nothing will change my mind on that

$C: Ya an hour after it got posted I've been checking youtubes trending list from time to time and not once saw it listed. I'm in Northwest US.
$C: It didn’t run nearly as frequently as the anchor ones. It maybe aired a few times. The anchor versions aired every day this week, every show. 
$C: They would just hire someone else. The heart of the problem needs to be addressed. 
$C: Oh wow, way to prove a point mods!
$C: Yes and in recent years it's become increasingly the case that they have been more and more composed by partisan actors.

Meaning that depending on the sub and the particular mod, certain videos get removed just because they felt it hurt their cause, disagreed with their views and biases.

Yes, it's mods, but who these mods are and how the act has changed.

$C: bisexual actually.

the chemicals turn some of them into bitch boys
$C: The best propaganda is the propaganda that you don't realize is propaganda 
$C: Yeah, most propaganda is underhanded. It involves selective presentation of information and spinning of material to suit a narrative. 

You can see this in action when a economic stats are released and the reporting gives a completely different view depending on the political leaning of a station. "Unemployment down since last month" vs "Unemployment up since last year".
$C: These people don’t want to see any opposing opinions that could dangerous to their information monopoly
$C: BBC News (Government funded) showed me how scary Russian propaganda is when they said Britain killed innocent people invading Iraq.
$C: Yes we’re the only nation to ever drop nuclear weapons on a civilian population, twice, but it was a good thing, trust us. 
$C: Yasssss queen

$C: Whoa that's eye opening
$C: Yes, but one side is Neo nazis, so there's that.
$C: don't be smart, and actually blame the real culprint: consumerism
$C: This is Sinclair media group; this ain't leftist news lol
$C: Yes, no, right, left, we also know neo nazis invaded berline, and then left when russia left.
$C: So you hate men? 
$C: It’s like watching the video in text form. 
$C: Lol, hi Hillary.  You realize the "accuse your enemies of what you are doing" thing is from the Left wing "Rules for Radicals," right?  

I'm not sure if you're deliberately trying to lie or if you're just misinformed.
$C: Can ABC/CBS "burn" any affiliates that get purchased by Sinclair? I feel like there as to be some legal precedent for the equivalent of McDonalds corporate buying up a competitors franchise locations and that competitor having legal standing for damage.
$C: So who are they actually referring to when they are talking about fake news online?

I am confused because everyone is saying all the fake news is already from right wing sources.

Are they just afraid of competition?
$C: 
>...it forces local stations to run particular bits of scripted opinion content, making it seem as though the presented opinions come from the local station and thus giving them greater local credibility.

This sums it up perfectly.

$C: Is it like Google news search engine returning hits 90% of the time from left wing papers and media sites?

That is extremely dangerous to our Democracy.

(I searched Google News on “multiple Mansions, trump tax cut” today. Multiple hits from Washington Post, NYT’s, HuffPost, Salon, etc. I even got a Socialist On-line article.

Reason for my search, I heard Shaq say the days of owning multiple mansions was over- then Thanks Mr. President.)
$C: > The local affiliates are not really linked to the parent network at all

DID YOU NOT JUST WATCH THE VIDEO WHERE THEY ALL READ FROM THE SAME SCRIPT.
$C: Yes. This is prodigiously perilous to our democracy.

Yes. This is astronomically hazardous to our democracy.

Yes. This is exceedingly unsafe to our republic. ^^execute ^^order ^^66

$C: Dangerous to our democracy?
$C: To our democracy? 
$C: Ahh you're one of those "my side is infallible and the other is undeniably horrible" people. Congratulations, you're what's ruining this country.
$C: If you believe that *you* haven't been paying attention.


$C: I think the larger point theyre making is that BOTH SIDES are doing this. Sinclair may be a “right wing” propaganda machine but for every Sinclair there’s a “left wing” propaganda machine doing the same shit. That’s the takeaway. We’re all being played.
$C: I know. It's fascinating watching it play out and even better looking back at times in the past where the rules have been used successfully but we were oblivious at the time
$C: Ok I'll expand.

It appears that for some time now the GOP/Trump has been gaslighting, obstructing, and projecting the public in order to gain, and hold, power.

$C: You’d increase your persuasive quality if you didn’t blatantly lie. comrade :)
$C: See the problem is you guys only ever give a damn about freedom or democracy is when you can rag on the evil right wingers, it seems more of a push for partisan points then an actual support for democratic institutes.
$C: I agree with this if you accept that the Democrats are also right wingers for the most part with identity politics tacked on to the side.

Edit: u/vampireweekend20 replies for everyone to see and then blocks you so you can’t reply.
Obviously the sign of a strong argument there.

To reply to their reply before they blocked me: 
It’s no surprise a former moderate right winger is now a neoliberal and thinks there’s an actual difference  between those two things.
$C: Except both sides are and always have been doing it. 

It's not a left or right thing. It's a politician thing. 
$C: Fuck off.
$C: > However, the people that consume sinclear would not be as trusting because “insert derogatory geographical label” would be communicating the news to the them.

I have a hard time believing that. The majority of people consume whatever information fits their biases first and foremost, it doesn't matter whether it's coming from local or regional/national outlets. The fact remains that both offer the illusion of complete or accurate information.
$C: > Wrong, CNN is not misrepresenting itself as being a local community broadcast.

CNN misrepresents itself as being unbiased news, when it fact it's DNC peddled propaganda, and has been since the Bill Clinton days. 

[There's literally video of Larry King telling Presidential Candidate Bill Clinton that Ted Turner \(then CEO and owner of CNN\) would "Serve him".](https://youtu.be/PlJkgQZb0VU?t=15m9s)

The Obama administration was stuffed to the gills with the wives, husbands, brothers and sisters of media executives.
$C: Alright, I'm happy to admit when I'm wrong.  There are some right wing TV outlets.  In any case, it's disturbing regardless of which wing it's coming from.  Media (all media) has been used for the purpose of propaganda for a very long time and all too few people are aware of how blatantly it is used.
$C: I was mistaken with the name of the act but still correct in the assertion that it was Clinton that caused this media conglomeration. 

He signed the Telecommunications Act in 1996 that deregulated the media and allowed for cross-media outlets to coalesce under a single owner which is what is portrayed in this video.

It was President Ronald Reagan who got rid of the Fairness Doctrine on radio and broadcast mediums. 

Those two actions are primary contributors to the current dire state of the media in the US.

I will edit my comment above to reflect this.

$C: The Russia conspiracy was fabricated when Clinton lost the election.

During the election, Clinton's campaign had some focus groups where they'd give them various bits of information and see how they react. They discovered that when people were told of the Clintons' dealings with Russia, it negatively affected the way people viewed her.

When she lost, her campaign managers decided to push the conspiracy in order to sow the seeds of doubt.

In other words, they accused their enemy of what they were doing in order to muddy the waters.

Outfoxed is another good documentary on the destruction of objectivity and integrity in journalism. What started the downward spiral of main stream ~~news~~ entertainment outlets being propaganda arms for specific political parties/ideologies. 
$C: Extremely depressing though. Still also recommend.
$C: 1. ok? Red flag to open with an ad hominem against bbc?
2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_republic Even pure republics were a departure from the old ways of monarchies, by being more democratic. We do have direct democracy on state and local levels. 
3. Zionism is more of a religious problem and side plot in us politics. Nazism was extreme right and ended terribly. Communism was extreme left and ended terribly. I think it a good thing to avoid very bloody ideologies. 
4. It's because most of the world recognizes that there are flaws in capitalism, and the US also did as recently as the new deal. It's only in the US that it's propagandized to be flawless and needing no restraints. Socialism acts as a sort of counter balance in most first world countries, but they aren't even allowed at the discussion table in the US and the average citizen has suffered for it.  Noam Chomsky's 'requiem for an american dream' goes into this is great detail. 
5. It can be demoralizing to realize the extent of manipulation in society. Truths worth knowing are rarely happy or painless.  

It seems like you're trying to find some flimsy reason to discard the entire documentary?
$C: But it is just a tiny bit strange
$C: The fact you think Spez iz super right wing! 😂
$C: Have you been to r/politics lately? 

If the CEO of this site was super super right wing, we would see the overwhelming left dominance being stifled rather than pushed.

The one place you can visit on this site that doesn't shit on Republicans and Trump is The_Donald. 
$C: No I don’t, or if he is he’s doing a great job whipping the left up in to a normie alienating hysteria. 

Personally I think he’s been paid off. 
$C: Dude he has been very open about being a democrat. He also donated to the Clinton Campaign and Clinton foundation. 
$C: If your news anchors are 20-something and straight out of college, you probably live in a small city. Jobs in TV news pay very poorly and most small stations can only afford to hire a young anchor. In fact, the anchors you’re talking about are probably primarily reporters—not anchors.
$C: Yea, ill disagree on that.  I've spent a few years working in one of the major news networks. Those young girls dont go straight from college to TV. They have to put in some serious work still, TV is low pay, long hours, and highly competitive.  

Some of the people I know who are now anchors on local networks around the country were easily  putting in 80+ work weeks.
$C: That's the entire point of a journalist, though. To obtain information about a subject and report it to the public, so they are informed about an issue that they otherwise would have done their own research on.

You really expect journalists to be experts on every subject in the world?
$C: I used to do a lot of school functions and often we'd visit the morning news station to promote them. So I got to meet quite a few over the years. Didn't matter their age, in fact, it seemed to get worse as they got older. The younger ones still had some personality. The older ones were like shells of real people. I mean really, it was mildly disturbing trying to talk to them. Like they lived in the uncanny valley. She stays long enough, you're acquaintance will end up like that. 

If you've been reading a teleprompter for two decades or more, and all the while being treated differently because you're a minor celebrity in the local area, and you're okay with such a terribly unfulfilling job - for that long - as a stooge who says all he's told, never questioning it, never diverting ... you're just a compete dimwit, without any real soul left.

Let's face it, when your job is literally only reading the script, you lose the job if you don't do it to their satisfaction. You're literally on one of the shortest leashes there is in that role. The same effect happens to long term prisoners.

And I think that was a major point in 1984. The party circle is *more of a prisoner* than the society they appear to speak for and govern. It's the inner circle that pulls the strings, and if any of them step out of line they're cannibalized by the others. The proles on the outside, who don't really bother to pay attention or care to the propaganda and instead go on with their seemingly meager lives: they're the ones who are really free. 
$C: >My attitude is something along the lines of "use only as much government as is absolutely necessary".

That's kinda everyone's stance. No one is for "unnecessary government". I personally think government is necessary for lots of things, some don't. The debate is where that line is.

I would hope something like this crosses everyone's line.
$C: This isn't a free market. The regulations in place promote corporatism. Government and business team up to benefit each other for the most part. Government bailouts, subsidies, state/municipal tax incentives...it all plays a role in how corporations are able to get so big.

In TV, it is consolidating because it is more profitable for companies to own large numbers of TV stations. You have better bargaining power against cable companies (another poison created by corporatism), and you can likely get a better deal from the AP, CNN, Nielsen and other companies who make money off local television stations for their services. It is harder these days for local news to be profitable in the changing media landscape, but for the most part you are getting fair reporting on local topics. I would even argue local news probably leans slightly left of center if there is a tilt on the whole.
$C: Of course, point is the most shocking difference with US media is the amount of opinion injected into news. It's not "Trump gives speech", it's "Trump gives rambling, incoherent speech". There's more effort put into manipulating public reception than being informative.
$C: its more prevalent in the right but it's more of a human and uneducated "phenomenon" far from right only.

$C: Its a nice a book but sometimes It fells like Orwells going on awkward tangents of "Look what your future is and how terrible people are why cant we back to the old days". 
$C: I understand that, but one company having it's subsidiaries read a prepared statement is nothing like the ministry of truth. Sinclair isn't state-run, it's just the parent company.

It's an interesting video but just because they're reading it, doesn't mean it's malicious or untruthful. They're a media company, this is how they communicate with thier customers. What are they supposed to do, email you?
$C: The script they're reading is not manipulation it's the truth. It's a good script. The real, ultimate irony here is that the reddit hivemind sees an 'apparent hivemind' and is so anti major media that it has bypassed *actually listening to the message*.
$C: [deleted]
$C: At least it was a "scandal free" presidency, or so I've heard...
$C: > controlled

I don't think that's how "the media" works.
$C: So which media did the Obama administration control?
$C: “controlled”

Please explain to me how Obama *controlled* anything Fox or CNN or MSNBC said on air.


EDIT: just as I thought: *CAN’T*
$C: >So Obama had mass media singing his praises 

You and I must have been watching different mass media.

> Even when he was droning civilians, the media praised him

That's not what I remember.  It was the "liberal media" taking Obama to task for excessive use of drones and deaths of civilians.

>Trump comes along bashing MSM and saying they're fake news - EXACTLY WHAT THIS VIDEO SHOWS - and everyone listens to the media and believes he's evil.

This video shows local news stations all owned by the same company, Sinclair Broadcasting Group.  That company is owned by a family of highly conservative Trump supporters.  The FCC, lead by Trump appointee Ajit Pai has paved the way for Sinclair to purchase more and more local stations.  Hence this video.

Like I've said elsewhere - it's your side that's doing this shit.  Maybe this video will have you at least question whether that's a good thing.
$C: Fox news is mainstream and has a giant amount of power and influence. 

Yet they like to imagine themselves as a scrappy underdog bringing truth against the wishes of a powerful SJW organization that seeks to undermine the familial and democratic structure of America. 

$C: Fair point, however he is fairly correct in his assessment of MSM, CNN and their ilk. I’m pretty sure we all know Fox News is not an objective source for information and pretending that the liberal propaganda outlets are objective isn’t entirely accurate. I have never seen this amount of vitriol by the press on the left before in my life so it will be interesting to see how this all ends up. We all know Fox is basically trash, we should know they are all trash.
$C: No it isn't wtf. His complaint is that it's all fucking bought and sold.
$C: And I acknowledged that point in a later post. The bigger conversation is important and I’m glad that trump has brought it to the forefront, I don’t agree with his interpretation of it but I do agree that it is a huge problem. The left leaning outlets were never critical of obama and there were plenty of times that he deserved it. Fox was critical all the time even when obama didn’t deserve it and now we have exactly the opposite. If you ask the average politico that subscribes to those channels what has opposite party president done right they will tell you that they have done nothing right and everything wrong, that’s both sides. Most  people who pay attention and don’t watch garbage can tell you what both obama and trump have done right and wrong. 
$C: Are you if the belief that this sort of thing doesn’t happen in the liberal media or is your comment on just what the bloviator in chief has said? 
$C: It doesn't make his statements about dishonest news any less valid, just diminishes his faith in Fox News.
$C: Well, when you say main issue, and you list the lesser issue first which made no change on the ranking...
$C: You are splitting hairs

$C: Netherlands also has a national broadcasting service and we rank 5th (2nd in 2016), so it's probably something else?
$C: Yeah, Rupert Murdoch has his filthy claws in our media just like he does the US. I'm just surprised that Australia is 19th.
$C: Id trust the BBC over Fox News any day of the week
$C: And they're much much better than places like Daily Mail.
$C: The biggest news sources in the top 5 countries are all owned by the government....
$C: Owned by the government but operated independently. It’s well regarded as one of the best news sources. I’m more worried by the ones owned by Murdock and Co. 
$C: There is nothing wrong with government-owned media as long as it is not controlled by the government. BBC is allowed to criticize the UK government and run stories on government corruption. Contrast this with something like Russian state media where the government has a say in what can and can't be reported and the only time they can be critical of politicians is if they are on Putin's bad side. As long as the PM isn't dictating what content is run by the BBC, there is no issue with it. In fact, it gives them some independence from corporations which is very important.

Now not all of these were covered up, but there are still a lot out there. I'll try and find the new stories but only a month or so ago was it revealed that there was some form of inaction by the police over some of the cases. Became pretty big news here in the UK.
$C: Had no idea what is name was. Thanks for clarifying. 
$C: Then why aren’t all choices and actions arbitrary and detached from their consequences instead of predictably reflective of a consistent external reality?
$C: Yes, it did. Believe it or not, there was once a time when the news was more interested in reporting on facts and getting the story to the people instead of selectively choosing narratives to push.  
$C: That's because - other than Sinclair stations - there _isn't_ anything fishy about the political pieces. 
$C: Sorry, I guess I don't know the proper terminology because like most people, I'm a layman with this sort of stuff.

Basically they should be forced to put their name directly on the logos. Just like Nestle should be forced to put their name front and center on all the products and companies they own so I don't have to memorize hundreds of different everyday products in order to stop funding their destruction of the Great Lakes.
$C: Repeating the phrase 'nothing burger' isn't remotely the same thing.

In fact that clip you posted is completely hypocritical considering it's right-wing AM radio broadcasts including Rush Limbaugh that popularized the phrase 'nothing burger'. And they've been repeating it over and over and over again throughout this past year.


It's akin to Trump accusing the media of repeating the phrase 'fake news' and creating a montage, despite the fact that he's the one who popularized it and still keeps using it. 

Edit: And the reason I responded with 'vote out republicans' is because they're the ones specifically trying to consolidate all local news stations under one right-wing media conglomerate.  The right-wing head of the FCC also is largely responsible for all this.  There is no oversight, because the republicans are facilitating all of this.

$C: Tried to comment before but comments were locked. 

I can't comment on what it was like living 500 years ago...what I can say is...

We've reached Dickensian levels of inequality again, we're living in the second gilded age during the sixth mass extinction spasm. Slavery is rife, war and famine, millions of refugees, prison rates, the global domination of economic ideology...people stacked up in factories like battery chickens, battery chickens. Indigenous mortality. The break down of the stable climate we all depend on, *the end of cheap oil which made population explosion possible*... All these things are adding up. 

When people say things are better than they've ever been, I can't help thinking...but for WHO? Perhaps the person making the comment is enjoying some peak of hard won privilege, but that's not to say their grandchildren will enjoy the same comforts.

That said... Delusional optimism has got us this far, without it we couldn't carry on.

Carry on.
$C: Ah, yes. Being beaten and kept as slaves is a much better quality of life as free men dying to maintain their freedom.

$C: That's not 'quality of life' that's 'death rate.'
$C: I'm not 100% sure that conservatives "disappearing" would effect media monopolies.  When shown an excellent video on manipulated media, you immediately jump on your team's wagon and start chanting.

$C: Right, but this specifically is neo nazis propaganda.
$C: youre real
$C: I know my reply is pointless but oh well.  Your link demonstrates that 'must-run' segments exist.  It does not demonstrate that this specific segment is one of them.  That seems to be an assumption, but you're treating it as if it were a fact.      
$C: Not proof that this was a "must-run" segment.
$C: Yeah, and it keeps going back and forth. Three hours ago, it was locked and now it's back up?
$C: I'd argue the Democrats are much the same.  They were fine to tow party lines and support Hillary at the drop of a hat.  I know you are stuck voting for one of two options, but its really systemic flaws with first past the post that are to blame.

Many people voted Trump because they wanted real change, which Hillary who pushed the Iraq war and banking deregulation was not

$C: You can repeat this comment as many times as you want; it doesn’t make it true. 
$C: Lmao you're sure right buddy, American democracy used to be so fair and perfect when it was dominated by urban political machines that essentially just functioned as competing mafias determining our political leaders.
$C: >Downplaying it is dangerous.

Are you seriously going to use that line commenting in this thread? "This is dangerous to our democracy" All shills are the same. "This is scary"
$C: That's because Trump is especially stupid, not because of what /u/LobotomistCircu  is talking about. I think what he says rings true. 
$C: >Can you point out stories that they published that were completely made up? Literal fake news

sure, they lied about "no go zones" in europe to stoke antimuslim bigotry and recanted after damage was done as one example.

>Sometimes news orgs publish false stories, but any reputable news source will post a redaction. I'm willing to bet you can't find one fake news story that doesn't have a redaction

since were moving goal posts and even though youre pretending they arent self aware liars, Id give you the example of fox hosting people slandering obama as a kenyan muslim for years




$C: I am assuming you mean besides they are currently being sued for the Seth Rich news they reported on
$C: fox is biased and also publishes fake news regularly, it doesnt belong with respectable  press
$C: Part funded and enforced by the government sounds like a sponsorship to me!
$C: The world being a globe is a matter of fact though, not a personal opinion on public policy... Which is what the person you're responding to was obviously talking about.

$C: Hannity is a talking head commentator - not a reporter or anchor. 

Granted, FNC does everything in their power to ignore the distinction and allow the viewer to blur that line on their own.
$C: I'm not saying CNN doesn't have it's problems, but let's not ever forget the main reason it's being targeted *this much* for being so-called "fake news" is because they were the first large network to stop pretending that something *the entire world was already talking about* didn't exist. And iirc, they didn't even report on its contents.


Trump essentially threw a hissy fit cause they were the first to stop playing dumb and admit "Yes. There may in fact be an elephant in the room". Apparently not reporting as if the room is empty is "fake news" even though we all knew the elephant was there and was already talking about it. Apparently they had to play pretend, otherwise they're fake news.
$C: CNN is not a champion of unbiased journalism. They are a propaganda wing of the Democratic Party. 
$C: https://youtu.be/RE-uhXKO-nk
$C: Under the carpet sweeper extraordinaire. 
$C: Shareblue is really bad too
$C: Don't mistake opinionated with false.
$C: CNN and MSNBC are just as bias as Fox News.
$C: And to address your last point, I am probably moderate if I had to label myself, which makes me a flaming liberal in this political climate. My impression of CNN is that they are extremely centrist to a fault, msnbc is fairly left leaning, and fox is controlled to the point that their non-news shows fear talking about anything anti-republican.
$C: > Its all corporate-filtered information, its propaganda.

This is not true for local affiliates. There are dozens of media groups in the local affiliate ownership market. 

>Watch some independent media 

This comes with a word of warning and caution. Many people laud IND media outlets like DemocracyNow, but they have a direct, stated, intentional bias to their reporting as much as Sinclair does. They have injected themselves into stories and selectively aired footage of events to support their narrative (which the unedited footage undermines.) 

IND outlets that use any opinionated language in their reporting instantly lose credibility. 
$C: I think saying that major news networks are somewhat garbage us another matter. Yes, CNN made a ton of money covering a disappeared plane for two months straight, but while that is sad it is in my opinion different from deliberately pushing a specific narrative regardless of what is happening in real life. Most of the news networks are profit maximizing, so they report on things that get a lot of viewing time. 

The original person I replied to was complaining that CNN, msnbc, and fox are all *biased*, and I absolutely do not think the first two are in the same category as the third in that regard. 
$C: When did MSNBC make up something out of whole cloth like FOX did with Seth Rich?
$C: I am trying to figure out where this idea started. Is it out of a need to have an equivalent on both sides to feel like you're being fair? Because they are not even close to the same thing. Back when I watched Jon Stewart on the Daily Show, there is a reason 90% of his material came from Fox News. I'm sure he would have loved to make fun of other news networks but they just don't purposely fuck it up nearly as much. 

When a major story criticized Obama, every major news network put it center on their front page. When a major story criticizes Trump, every major network puts it center on their front page... except Fox who buries it somewhere in a side column.
$C: What are you? Some sort of idiot? :D
$C: Bullshit.
$C: Ohhhh. That makes more sense, whoops.
$C: i havnt even posted on td for ages, i have *ascended* beyond them. Is the MDE subreddit really that much of a boogeyman these days?
$C: Wait am I being used as a good example of tribalism? Lol
$C: I never said that the democrats were angels. They would most certainly pounce on the opportunity to control the media like this.  
  
I'm just saying that, right now, buying up tons of news stations to spread a message is not a general trend, but a specific instance. Therefore, saying "both sides are doing it" is not valid in this case.  
  
Side note: I know the democrats do bad shit too.
$C: Affiliate local channels license the brand of the national channels and are obligated to broadcast them a few hours of the day. The rest of the programming is decided by the stations themselves, or in this case their parent company, Sinclair. For 20 out of 24 hours per day, these networks blast pro-Trump bullshit to unsuspecting viewers, regardless of the licenced brand (CBS, NBC, ABC, FOX)

Uh huh, sure. 
$C: Yeah you're clearly living in an alternate reality than the rest of the world. 
$C: Because Occupy started out as a alt-right movement.../s

Referring to when it seems people actually started using "the 1%" as a talking point.
$C: are you actually dumb? It was started by the pro-union guys, the economically left wing guys
$C: That's a really good tool! Although I wouldn't want to tarnish EVRYONE who posted on a sub just incase they were just innocently discussing something. But *that* one sub is a fairly safe bet tbf.

Thanks for the tip , sucks I wasted gold on a racist . 
$C: T_D poster here. Fox News is just as bad as CNN but on the other side of the aisle. I personally believe pretty much all news is biased and trying to push an agenda. Its why I read from news outlets on both sides.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Synchronizing of society, bringing it under the same control under Nazi rule. Often the focus is on the media in that regard where free individual publications were taken over or closed down, making them report the same way or not at all.

I don't want this to be some slippery slope argument and Sinclair  isn't comparable to the NSDAP taking control of the media but the basic dynamic is similiar in a much more limited way and the word itself - Gleichschaltung - while difficult to translate could be translated as 'make behave the same' or 'bring under one control' when it comes to public institutions.
$C: Like I had said we don't know how the video creator edited the footage. They may have said that at the beginning and the editor chose to cut it out or they may have said that at the end and cut it out. If you ask me if it's correct that they didn't say it was a parent statement, no I don't. But as a viewer I need to understand where these statements are coming from. I am aware that my news anchor isn't just going to tell me how he or she feels and that the statement has been written for them. 
$C: But why are you acting like Trump is fighting this? Trump appointed a man to head the FCC who has changed rules to allow Sinclair to merge and gain even more market share. Maybe it’s time to realize what Trump says is just a way to cover for when he does the opposite 
$C: lol na it was a r/leagueoflegends comment

$C: it shows up on different top score pages. weird system
$C: Yeah I hear the media giants who happen to own his television show are telling him what to say.  I don't even watch John Oliver but you are spouting bullshit to scare people.
$C: Thanks for the clarification!  Hell, I forget what the post was about.   
$C: Still says FOX. 
$C: And you do? Good response. Lol 
$C: To be potus you think you don’t have an ego? You think these politicians don’t have egos? 

Look at obama now saying he wishes he could make a million Obama’s. Is that that not egotistical? But you won’t see that on cnn will you. But if trump were to say that....oh boy, you wouldn’t hear the end of it. 

He’s exercising his first amendment. Just like everyone else. He will live and die by the media. I see his flaws, I just don’t really care that much that I allow it to bother me. 

It is what it is. Just remember this. When he won, everyone said the world would end, and that everything would go downhill. Things are looking pretty good. And just to humor you, let’s say obama “left it in a good place”, hypothetically speaking, it hasn’t gotten worse. Which is what the left said, and has been saying. If you hate trump, it’s cool. I just don’t think there’s any reason to be so hysterical and emotional.
$C: I love Trump tweets. They are always relevant, often hilarious, and sometimes cringey. Getting other people's reactions on them instantly let's me know if they are a boring cunt. The hateful comments on every one of his tweets really make him look like a 'very stable genius' by comparison. I mean, I hated snake oil salesman/warmonger Obama and knew he was full of shit from day 1, but I didn't make it a full time job.

I vastly prefer a fired up pres tell us what he thinks than get the fucking Obama/Clinton/Bush doublespeak giving us meaningless platitudes we all think are so _presidential_. I just don't see how Trump addressing the public directly, in his natural way of speaking instead of a canned response from a PR team is a step back or bad for Americans. It's a step forward to some form of sanity and honesty in Washington.
$C: Yet when we bring up the strong economy all we hear is THATS OBAMA.  but but sitting president!
$C: lol, yikes 
$C: Yeah Obama was decent drone striking all the children in the middle east that's for sure
$C: Obama was portrayed as a decent man. Trump is portrayed as the opposite. Thats kind of the point.
$C: I'd rather have a mean, rude, and bad orator who causes vocal harm, than a president who is nice, smiley, and polite who causes legitimate physical harm to thousands of innocent people across the world.

Sure, Trump's not a "statesman" if that means not wanting to invade foreign countries like Bush did Iraq and Afghanistan, and Obama wanted to invade Syria, which would result in massive death and destruction and then not even fix anything in the Middle East but make things worse.

But hey, if you think someone who is not very friendly is better than someone who is outwardly friendly only, that's your choice. Words are far less important than actions.
$C: Lol. I disagree. Obama and his administration expanded the surveillance powers of the State and extrajudicial powers with the National Defense Authorization Act, endorsed the power play Affordable Care Act, drone strike programs, crackdown on whistleblowers, more Middle East interference, and in my opinion: divided the American people more than ever. You fell for his PR, PRopaganda, or are working in those fields if you believe what you say. I can't recall anything decent he actually did. Legalized gay marriage but by superseding state supreme courts? 

Get real.
$C: >Obama was a decent man

Someone fell hook line and sinker for the "politicians are people" meme 
$C: So I assume this criticism came from cnn? Or cbs? Msnbc? Oh ok I thought so

$C: I didn't take you as agreeing with them. I'm just continuing the thought.

There is no liberal media as envisioned by people who use that term.
$C: To elaborate

This is funny but a little different than what's happening in OP's video. Every station subscribes to one or more newsgathering services that provide video and scripts that they can plug into their newscasts. The Conan bit is just them being lazy and not rewriting any of the leads/intros they were provided.

OP's video is a "must-run" segment from Sinclair. Stations are forced to run this; they don't have a choice.

This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.


$C: I wasn't making a point, just a joke ;)


$C: Capitalism is a free market with no government intervention.  When there is government intervention, you no longer have true capitalism.  I know you don't like capitalism, but every predatory economy cannot just be called "capitalism" because you don't like capitalism.  Language is important, and ambiguity doesn't help when language any word can mean anything. 
$C: we're not talking about youtube we're talking about creating a business, what drugs are you on?
$C: Channels that can be banned or shutdown within minutes because you’re using a corporation’s platform. You have no recourse when they kill your channels either. 
$C: Uh no that wasn't the take away at all..
$C: Won't anyone think of the poor, defenseless billionaires?
$C: That’s funny, you made me laugh

No, I mean those dirty socialists blaming the rich for their own short-comings, it looks like I’m talking to one of those “socialists”.  

Do you know what the 1A is? Do you know how the world functions? Based on your comment you seem to know nothing, why else would you make a senseless claim? Oh right. 
$C: I'm aware that Sinclair is a conservative organization, but the script that they had the sations read was completely innocuous. This was tweeted by the New York Times, do you think it would get over 250,000 upvotes on Reddit? Of course it wouldn't. People hate this statement because they hate Sinclair not because the statement in and of itself is bad.
$C: well durrr, really!
$C: >and the gold is some person's arbitrary, subjective way of saying "thanks for posting this"? 

See, that wasn't hard was it.

I find it bothersome to reward a random redditor who [posted a random video they saw](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/88ll08/this_is_what_happens_when_one_company_owns_dozens/dwm4r43/) and be pot lock that they posted it first and get rewarded for sheer luck..! Is not the useless Upvote value enough? 

I have no problem with the video or the poster. I do question the mental state of those who reward with money for simply posting a video. It bothers me that I live in a world with such a mentality.

What it really shows is the narcissistic trait of those who buy Gold by wanting to be noticed by OP and say *look at me I agree with you*. 

OP is just looking bemused in the mirror going *WTF! Yippeeeeeee*

edit: and so the Gold hits continue, maybe in sheer rebuttal of this post of mine, to show their group-think idealism - well the joke is on them.
$C: ...watch CNN and Fox, they will answer this question if you just keep watching...you can trust them...they aren't like stone tablets which prey on the emotions of readers for ratings...trust the media, trust them, trust, trust, blind trust...

$C: Alex Jones?
$C:  Bernie isn't going to win.
$C: What do you mean? Look at all of the policy hes enacted.  The wall, immigration reform, taking care of veterans, hes crushing it.  I mean, hes doing so well he has time to golf roughly every 3 days and vacation at his own resorts all the time!  Did Obama crush it so hard he could just take vacations and golf ~1/3 of his presidency?  Hell no.  He was too busy wearing tan suits, using dijon mustard, and trying to ensure all Americans had access to medical care.   Maga, am I right?  Is that how it goes, T_D fans?  
$C: TDS is the new hand-wave dismissive of anyone's anti-Trump opinion. (Trump Derangement Syndrome)
$C: Thoughtless comment. Thoughtless poster? I only wish to superimpose the message here onto the bigger picture. Maybe that's hard for you to understand. I can tell where you want the focus, however. I don't have a horse in your race, it'd just be running in circles.
$C: Not change the subject, in fact it's in line with this. Like I said this problem of scripted reporting is not partisan, it's across the board. You may think that there are differences in policy etc., but most of those at the top are interested in power play, and the shadow parties involved use this divisive strategy of 'partisanship' to keep any sort of civil dissent completely confined to a safe and manageable space. Anecdotally, most people I knew during the election either voted 'this' because they were scared of 'that' or vice versa. But it was a fool's choice. This, or that. Status quo. Safe and manageable space. This making any sense? I'm putting this concept in the context of the bigger picture.
$C: And here we see the elites plans in action; You vs. me. Us vs. Them. My team vs. your team. Sad no one ever seems to realize this. 
$C: 100%!

This is me rolling my eyes. 
$C: Whaaa? I mean, not a Trump fan in anyway myself, but whaaa???
$C: The problem is, 90% of what they report on isn't newsworthy. They create scandals out of thin air and don't actually report extensively on the things that could actually affect our day to day lives and our futures. Anderson Coopers interview with Stormy Daniels is a great example, like freakin Jerry Springer. 
$C: There is a difference between being biased, and biased reporting.  Biased reporting is dishonest, and untrustworthy.  News reporting should be unbiased, and free of opinion.
$C: I have a sneaking suspicion CNN and Fox News are both controlled by the same elite group
$C: Well as long as we get our two minutes of Trump hate in, I guess.
$C: It's like a false signal.to the brain, a social one
$C: Yeah exactly.  Local news is for weather and traffic and shit, whatever those jerks on the city council are doing to the roads this time.  People don’t watch it expecting to get programmed by far-reaching right wing messaging, which makes it sneaky and fairly dangerous.
$C: A lot of people think CNN isn’t biased as fuck though. They actually trust TV news. 
$C: One big channel pushing an agenda in multiple market is just as much a problem as this.

$C: Let's be clear: nowhere in that segment do the broadcasters disparage *any* specific media or news organization.  
And while "fake news" is a Trump catchphrase, this segment addresses a national conversation about social media and fraudulent news.  
I'm liberal as fuck, but I heard a standard blah-blah corporate statement of integrity in journalism, not a dismissal of all other sources of news.

"Karen, call the goddamned newspaper! The Channel 5 weatherman says we got to cancel our subscription!"  
$C: Sinclair is actively seeking to push that narrative just after taking over a majority of local news stations too.

It's an obvious powergrab by a right-wing propaganda machine.

Anyone who values journalism should have a problem with this.
$C: they dont lie or broadcast fake stories knowingly, cnn despite youre rightwinger slander campaign is among the respectable press, fox is not.
$C: Because the telecommunications act had so much to do with non telecommutation business growth right? 😂😂
$C: Read the fucking graphs and explain it, moron. Im not bringing up criminals like Reagan or Nixon. Im saying GOP voters are fucking morons that believe what Fox tells them even when its opposite from what it was a few short years before. That doesnt happen with dem voters. The facts are right there. I know its tough to realize you and your friends are fucking idiots.
$C: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=scripted+news
$C: One conglomerate *doesn't* own 72 percent of stations, moron. 

The stations that Sinclair owns broadcast to an area where they're available to 72 percent of homes with a television. That's still the largest reach of any particular broadcast television group in the country. But they don't own 72 percent.

There are about 1,780 broadcast television stations in the USA. Sinclair currently owns 173. If their deal with Tribune is approved, they'll have 223. A whopping 12.5 percent.

If you're going to have an argument, have your motherfucking facts straight.
$C: So you don't think that news agencies are fear mongering companies used by political parties on both sides to twist and warp reality to their needs? Going back decades this has been the case. Leaders in all major parties have agreed on it. Whatever way some kids these day lean, they know this as well. So sure call me an upset kid. From what I see "kids" are less ignorant and more enlightened than you. I don't know where you heard otherwise, but it shows that you are just a ignorant talking parrot head.
$C: Cognitive dissonance. You will do anything and everything to make sure your frame of reality doesnt shatter. Because if that dam breaks your left with nothing. I pitty the sheep.
$C: Yeah you're suffering from mental retardation. 

CNN covered Trump eating 2 scoops of ice cream for a week. Fucking literally

This is what I was responding to. It appears to only be an issue when the message is conservative. 

$C: [deleted]
$C: The company that's forcing stations to run this segment is Sinclair, which is very right-wing.
$C: The media isn't so much anti-Trump. They report the terrible things he and his administration have done and continue to do. Common decent folks with a brain have grown tired of the lies, chaos, debauchery, stupidity, ignorance, incompetence... What else? Help me out here.
$C: Do you not know what right wing media is? Hint, it's fucking right wing.
$C: Let's be real. It's about 50/50. Lots of news outlets praising Trump as well. 
$C: Do you understand that there are multiple outlets with multiple angles and the poster you’re responding to is referring to right wing media that is favorable towards Trump?  


$C: You realize these videos are all Sinclair Broadcasting, a very right-wing media group, forcing stations to all air the same segment whether they want to or not.

They are not remotely left-leaning news broadcasts.
$C: Wrong. This is Sinclair, a hard right wing organization's network of local news stations airing a 'must-run' segment penned by right wing propagandists.
$C: So we're just going to ignore the Sinclair Broadcast Group?

$C: These are MSM lol.         
How about Media Matters? hmm?
$C: What difference does that make?         
Well, it's important to point out that all MSM do this and not to restrict the conversation to which os worse. I think that's fair, don't you? We reject MSM bias in all forms otherwise we'll all be in an echo chamber. 
$C: And the other networks did the same for Obama! So what's your point?            
The sooner peope ditch all these left/right MSM shit the better.        
Shit, don't you remember this whole act playing out with Bush jr? Bill Clinton? etc. etc.?! It's really pretty obvious what networks are going to have what opinion. lol

$C: You don't have to word for word parrot! if they do it makes the game easy lol, you can do the same much better by reporting on the same issues and  repeating reaction to it without using same words. Does the same thing only one is more visible than the other.       
I assume it's market research and what audience reacts to which better, either way it's just a different face of the same coin.
$C: Exactly! It’s my belief this is done purposely by the those in influential positions to conflate the two and distort the truth. 
$C: Lol.... sucks to be you....  how did you guys go from hero to zero to quickly 
$C: I can’t find the clip since I knew someone would bring it up, but Trump had said before that it’s a deal he would have made as well. He’s not an idiot. But now he’s on the other side of it and is working FOR the USPS to get a better deal. Same thing with China. He said the same about both. Doesn’t fault them for making good deals for themselves, but America should be trying just as hard and in the past, we just weren’t. 

Trump knows he would have done the same thing in Bezos shoes. (Maybe, I’m assuming there but still). And the campaign ordered office supplies. Does that make the fact that Bezos is getting a very very good deal on the Usps that loses them money? No. That fact still stands. Am I going to drop amazon even though I know it hurts our Usps? Well no, I didn’t make that deal. It’s not my fault. So get a better deal and make things fair if he can. We will see. Nothing about that story invalidates the truth. That some people working for the campaign bought office supplies from amazon. That’s just hilarious that people think that is actual news.

On every main story on every iPhone I checked today. 

I don’t know if outraged is the word to use there but that’s not important. 

Yea it’s only a few outlets. I’m talking about why it’s catered this way. Slow news day? Who knows. MSM does report on bigger news. But places that cater stories have agendas too. I guess everyone does really. Lesson is, I guess just trust no one but yourself.  Think about why people are pushing these stories. 

Take this video from OP btw. It’s being spun many different ways and out of context purposefully. It was pulled a few times until it was spun as anti-trump. But like I said. I never liked MSM so I don’t care who it’s spun against. The message of the video op posted is that they can’t be trusted. And the people that made the video (reported to be from Deadspin) can’t be trusted either. Especially when politics are involved. Everyone gets biased. It’s a human fault. Yes I’m calling myself out too. 
$C: Sorry. I mean that the MSM and a station owner using the anchors to parrot the message is bullshit. Even if it was done as some anti or pro trump thing, I don’t like it. And deadspin doing it as well and pushing it as it’s own propaganda is just as bullshit, but like I said before. I hate MSM so I may not see it the same way. But this should be a wake up call to question MSM. Not to be used to misdirect anger at trump somehow, as some outlets are already doing. I guess I should wait and see how CNN handles/spins it. Though, their ratings are in the tank as well. It’s like there’s no single source for good “news” anywhere. Hmmmm
$C: And they always have been. I don't understand why everyone so shocked. Has veil finally been lifted? I guess, congratulations.
$C: Does CNN parrot this stuff too? NPR? In what ways are they also corrupt and propaganda?

$C: "OH SNAP"

Did i just get served?

Whatever. This is what goes for political discourse with you leftists. And what's wrong with liking russian cock? Hypocrites every one of you.
$C: I mean I figured it was bad but I just didn't know how bad..Yes you did help me thanks.
$C: How could you be unaware of local stations interests and ownership when their names and logos are plastered constantly all over the screen?

1) Literally any nationally-broadcasted station

2) Ok, admittedly, I don't know the exact viewership statistics of local news stations. Even if it's true, it's largely irrelevant to any point that was made, which was that there's zero difference between reaching, say 1 million viewers through one channel, or reaching 1 million viewers through 100,000 viewers on 10 channels. There's nothing even slightly creep or disturbing about this besides the one quote I pointed out.

Default subs are just insufferable.. I'll go now, since you've failed to further the conversation at all besides nitpicking insignificant details. Enjoy your echo chamber of melodramatic* outrage, I guess.
$C: Lol extra ironic they're telling me to watch for fake news online and here you are. Even if you're right dude, what difference does it make? If he paid himself to make an ad like local companies might do, would you be less upset? Or if he did add in your little prompt, would that make a difference? Dude owns the stations, who cares? Let him say what he wants. Why did dawn force their environmental ads on the whole world by washing oil off a duck? Could've just made a regular ad and said now a word from our ceo. It's fucking business, what do you expect? If you don't have a solution to the mysterious problem you still haven't really explained, what's the point in complaining? His message wasn't vote for trump, nuke Korea, or any other political agenda. It was "watch out for fake stories on social media". Such a terrifying thing to tell all of your viewers. Better watch out before he takes over the globe mannn
$C: Wow man so what do we do, we gotta bring down this Sinclair guy before he makes another message about fake news online and forces all of America to watch his message. lol the ironic part about this forced message is that I didn't see it until someone online wanted me to know I was being forced to watch it.
$C: But you even have access to the fucking internet for a definition. Weird.
$C: I get my information from all kinds of places. You just have to think critically about everything. All the news is bad, they all reek of desperation.
$C: Throw in some fresh fries and we'll call it a deal. I'll have to a Senate seat before ye olde JC can get out his cave tomorrow.
$C: Right, I didn't know Fox didn't own their own stations. That sounds really odd to me. Thanks for the info.
$C: No I’m poking fun at the fact that never was broadcast over the election by corporate media. But corporate media railed trump for social media and fake news stories. This script was meant against him. Contrary to what the above commenter said
$C: How is Sinclair having a view, and then “flooding the market” any different than what MSNBC or CNN do?  There’s no difference?

Also, how can Sinclair manipulate their audience, but CNN can’t?
$C: ...well i wont argue that alex jones is batshit, but there is a difference between the "right" and the "alt-right", contrary to popular belief. Ive personally never met or encountered anyone (well anyone who wasnt blatantly unstable, or trolling real hard) who actually supported alex jones and his views. hell if i remember correctly, hasnt he gone on record now and admitted it was all an act for entertainment? And just to clear any issue with my assumption that alex jones supporters are unstable or trolling, i just meant id be lying if i said id never encountered one, but its such a disproportionate minority that its always been very rare. I know fans, but thats different than actually believing chemicals are making frogs gay. 
$C: He didn't go down. He just got impeached but remained in office. 

Media is right wing biased? That's the funniest fucking thing I've ever read in my life. Ever. 
$C: I’d be paid better if I was :(
$C: I agree it is what’s supposed to be and some republicans definitely agree with regulation whilst inherently creating a slightly less free market. Honestly though for someone to say “Republicans” (no distinction of different types of republicans) are the problem that’s like saying 150 million different people, who think differently, have the exact same views and can be singled into one party.

I can almost see your pathetic overweight frame glowing in the dark, lit by your computer screen which is the only source of light in your room, giggling like a girl as you once again type your little "finland isn't real" quip. I imagine you little shit laughing so hard as you click it that you drop your Doritos on the floor, but it's okay, your mother will clean it up in the morning. Oh that's right. Did I fail to mention? You live with your mother. You are a fat fucking fuckup, she's probably so sick of you already. So sick of having to do everything for you all goddamn day, every day, for a grown man who spends all his time on reddit posting about a nordic country. Just imagine this. She had you, and then she thought you were gonna be a scientist or an astronaut or something grand, and then you became a "finland isn't real" poster. A pathetic unfunny "finland isn't real" poster. She probably cries herself to sleep everyday thinking about how bad it is and how she wishes she could just disappear. She can't even try to talk with you because everything you say is "FINLAND ISN'T REAL FINLAND ISN'T REAL EASTERN SWEDEN LMAO". You've become a parody of your own self. Amd that's all you are. A sad little man laughing in the dark by himself  as he prepares to indulge in the same old dance that he's done a million times now. And that's all you'll ever be.
$C: People are downvoting you. Is America not a real place? 
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Just Monika
$C: Railroads.
$C: I think you completely missed the part in my short post about companies buying the government.
$C: It seems broadcast news is trying to get eyeballs in an era that has so many places for them to be. Maybe back when they had a monopoly they felt a need to also educate, but now that it is a dog eat dog environment, they are going for the easy money.

Any broadcast news trying to provide more than sensationalism is worth both the time and money. Aside from PBS, I haven't really found one, though
$C: "he must be a Russian plant if he doesn't think like a moron"

Listen to yourself.
$C: You mean let's drain the sewer?
$C: Only in America have you retards actually managed to fool yourselves into thinking you're not overzealous nationalists (like those dirty foreigner nationalists) by inventing another word for it.

Nationalism and patriotism are the exact same thing. Christ, in a thread dedicated to exposing the kind of nightmare-level propaganda America's citizens are exposed to, you guys have already quickly started begging to be returned to the warm embrace of that same propaganda. 
$C: how dense can a person be? your friends seem dumb. tell me there aren't many people like that?
$C: If your best friends are nationalists, doesn’t that make you one by proxy, since you obviously have decided to remain friends with them and NOT CALL THEM OUT ON THEIR FASCIST IDEOLOGY?

You, taking the “I guess we agree to disagree” cop-out only enables Nationalist Nazi scum to exist and perpetuate.


$C: It's important to note you're learning about important political topics....

Through comics
$C: Unfortunately the guy who made that comic has no idea what nationalism means, he just has an idea of it in his head that is incorrect.
$C: I agree. Maybe my views are different after my stepdad came back from Iraq with ptsd, and still seeing how he loves his country, but hates his government.
$C: Principles don't change. That's the whole point 
$C: If you had that kind of wealth you wouldn't feel like that
$C: This is my "if I ever win the lottery" fantasy
$C: Like the BBC?
$C: I guess you aren’t educated enough to realize the word patriot is what was used to describe those who supported American independence from Britain during the American revolution. So therefore, without patriots and their *patriotism* we would not have a country today. 
$C: It's the most American thing I've read all days so you're absolutely right lol
$C: well that's rather cynical. There's a lot more to our history than that, and believing otherwise is willfully being an ignoramus. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: But then one of the first things we did as a country was immediately crush and disarm a tax revolt...

Rhetoric and action don’t always align. 
$C: Hatred of **oppression** is the reason this country exists. Taxation without representation was one form of oppression. 


$C: patriotism and nationalism are NOT synonymous, and I have no idea how you could think they are. 

"extreme nationalism" is a tautology.

nationalism is EXCESSIVE patriotism. 

patriotism in moderation is a healthy thing. 
$C: You think ww2 was a stupid cause? Do you think the revolutionary war was a stupid cause? 
$C: >there is no "nobility" in serving your country, from an objective standpoint

that's quite a dumb thing to say, because the concept of what is "noble" is an entirely subjective affair. Some might say loyalty and sacrifice (for one's country) are the most noble traits a man can exhibit. In fact, the entire West is built upon the idea of sacrifice, to the point our dominant religion is about a guy sacrificing himself by getting nailed to a 2x4 in order to save the rest of us. Sacrificing yourself for the benefit of your country has been a "noble" trait ever since the Roman Republic, which inspired our government heavily

$C: I mean... I'm not well informed on either, but I'm assuming they are autonomous from the actual politicians?

I kinda feel like it should be implied I don't mean that, but if not I'd love to know a better way to put it.
$C: Please tell me you understand the difference between the BBC and the russian government.
$C: Of course you think that. The BBC controls all the information you see. 

The BBC, predictably, is completely unwilling to criticize those in control of it. 
$C: > Their information sphere is far less polluted than ours.  
  
How many rubles for each asinine comment?
$C: Nowhere did I say a public broadcaster is literally incorruptible. What is rather obvious is that a public broadcaster's funding comes from a completely different source. In Western nations that funding is generally given constantly without dictating the content. The video in question is the literal total opposite of that. 
$C: Yeah, that's kind of my point. If they can do it, why the fuck can't we get that shit figured out in the US? That's like your retarded little brother somehow getting into a better college than you - it should be a wake up call.
$C: How about we don't nationalize it but we do socialize it?

Neither private citizen nor government gets to own media companies, because of their very real effects, and so the press must be run through worker-owned cooperatives. That is, no matter how many people work for the company, they all have a share and thus a right to have a say in how it's run. This way news is closer to the whims of the populace since it isn't produced by a specific person looking to maximize their own paycheck.

Big cooperatives like Mondragon prove it's possible to have a working yet sizeable cooperative. And you could even mandate it act as a non-profit if you really wanted to drive home the anti-propagandistic aim.
$C: Oh yeah, but at least it's obvious, right? The bad part about what's going on in the US, in my opinion, is that it is hidden. If it were obvious what the news corps' biases were, and which channels were owned by those corporations, it might be a little easier to know you're being fed propaganda and not news. 

In Poland, it was my experience that if you wanted propaganda, you tuned in for that, but otherwise everything else was independent. Have things changed?
$C: I'm not the guy you were originally responding to, fyi.

Either way, they are a former eastern bloc country. The reason I used Poland as an example is because they are a much poorer country with a less educated populace, yet they have great consumer protections and what not. What's the excuse in the US if motherfucking *Poland* can do it?
$C: how is it not first world? it has a higher gdp ppp per capita than portugal or greece? higher HDI than south korea and equal to israel
$C: >Would it be fair to assume your objection to this particular company stems from their message being contrary to your political view point? 

No, I stated that I oppose all entities who behave this way.

>consider a broadcaster who uses their influence to push a more p1-o2 friendly agenda, would you still trust a government (whom you may not agree with) to regulate it?

Yes, I have vested interests which should be kept in check. I know enough to know I do not know everything.
$C: How do you not see that Sinclair already IS restricting freedom of the press? I’m talking about restricting a corporate agenda from shaping the narrative.

We need to bring back objective journalism.
$C: >more Democrats than Republicans voted for the bill — 178 Democrats voted “yea” and five “nay”. On the Republican side, 132 Republicans voted for it and 102 against it.

It's not strictly conservative. Democrats do it ALL the time. You also have democrats taking bilions in private interest lobbying from corporations, to unions, to "non-profits" such as planned parenthood.

>The double standard is clear: When Democrats work on behalf of a special interest that aborts millions of children, they are doing so from a place of conscience and ideological purity. When Republicans argue in favor of Second Amendment rights, it is because they have been bought off by a disfavored lobbying group looking to profit from carnage.

Yes, and most of the media is bought and paid for by democrats, and it's apparent from their biased coverage. Fox News isn't the only one being biased and is nowhere near the worst at this.

The free press is independent podcaster and journalist, not mainstream media journalists.
$C: [I never said she stole my money](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/64ae8h/i_never_said_that_she_stole_my_money_what_are_the/).
$C: You get your political opinions from YouTube videos, and I’m the naive one? The study presented in the video doesn’t even agree with what you said.

The  fact that public policy seems to align more closely with the opinions of the top 10% of income earners in the population hardly fits with your claim it’s a small cadre controlling everything. 
$C: I won't argue those points, but if you can agree to getting money out of politics, then we should be allies. We don't need to put up scapegoats of villains if can agree what is unacceptable and a common goal. Too often people that try to paint Hillary Clinton as the devil are far more concerned with whataboutism and being argumentative than actually solving problems. I hope that doesn't include you.
$C: Please, Democrats try to run the best person for the area in question. Sometimes that's a moderate instead of true-blue progressive. At any rate, it's better to have differing opinions within our party than to walk in lock-step. 

Democrats, even moderate ones, support antitrust legislation. 
$C: "Both parties are the same, so don't bother voting" is such an insidious Republican tactic. 
$C: We already have antitrust legislation.  It's called the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act which is typically enforced by the FTC.  And republicans have been in favor of antritrust law.  Ironically Trump's administration vetoed a merger of two huge tech companies just the other week.
$C: Not all of them, no. For example, the Obama administration created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Trump administration is trying to close down the CFPB by defunding it. 

Democrats also push for appropriate legislation to ensure a competitive market where one company or family cannot control everything. 
$C: How would that solve the problem of a single corporation owning so many local news stations?
$C: Can't wait for all of our roads, water, power, and education systems to be privately owned by for profit businesses with no regulation. What a libertarian paradise! 
$C: I don't think attacking the government is going to get rid of the immense power that corporations have. The fact that businesses have grabbed the steering wheel is not proof that we don't need a steering wheel.
$C: Did you just group together acronym agencies?

NPR is not the problem here. They actually stand as a great success story when you consider that TLC used to also be a government funded education channel that went private and the result is some of the dumbest programming on TV with reality shows like Honey Boo Boo.

It's screwed up all the same though, but I doubt these tactics will work after "Conservative" becomes a dirty word.

Democrats support legislation to prevent monopolies and protect consumers, like the Obama-Admin created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. If Democrats take the Congress in November, they can at least prevent further rollbacks of consumer-friendly regulation. If Democrats take the Presidency in 2020, they will push for legislation to stop this from happening. 

Voting has consequences even if the payoff is not immediate. Vote !
$C: [deleted]
$C: Quite to the contrary, voting is the *only* thing that matters when you're hopelessly out-funded.

The midterms *are* important if you want to see America stick it to Comcast, Sinclair et al. But here's what *would* make the midterms fizz out and achieve nothing: if November 6th is, indeed, the anti-GOP slaughter everyone is hoping for, but then all the people who voted Democrat pat themselves on the back, declare "show's over, we won" and cease maintaining a strong engagement starting November 7th.

That's a large part of why Obama's presidency turned out to not be the enduring change people hoped for. The (not necessarily wrong) catharsis of toppling the Bush-Cheney empire gave way to a persisting attitude of "We did it! Mission accomplished!", which masked the reality that democracy is a **permanent commitment**. Young people voted in droves for Obama, but they didn't turn out to vote for the 2010 and 2014 midterms. Said midterms gave us the Congress that gave us yet another corporate sympathizer Supreme Court justice in Gorsuch and made the reversal of *Citizens United* that much further away. Complacency kills.

If people keep showing up to town halls and flooding their congressmens' mailboxes with questions about net neutrality, regardless of whose team "wins" on November 6th, it'll go a long way.

It's also worth mentioning that even without strong and enduring grassroots civic engagement in the Obama era, we still got net neutrality codified by the FCC for a couple glorious years before Ajit Pai took a shit all over things.

Both sides are not the same.

There's no substitute for mass numbers of citizens giving a heartfelt shit about an issue, but there's also a lot to be said for kicking Republicans' asses.
$C: Worse yet, when Bill Clinton signed the [telecommunications act of 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996) which allowed the consolidation of the media companies to begin with.
$C: Since they control the gated institutional narrative, anyone who poses a threat will get intentionally smeared or brushed under the rug.

Ah. A T_D poster. Deliberate disinfo shill. Makes sense that this thread is getting hit hard.
$C: "One of the more well known trusts was the Standard Oil Company; John D. Rockefeller in the 1870s and 1880s had used economic threats against competitors and secret rebate deals with railroads to build what was called a monopoly in the oil business, though some minor competitors remained in business. In 1911 the Supreme Court agreed that in recent years (1900–1904) Standard had violated the Sherman Act (see Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States). It broke the monopoly into three dozen separate companies that competed with one another, including Standard Oil of New Jersey (later known as Exxon and now ExxonMobil), Standard Oil of Indiana (Amoco), Standard Oil Company of New York (Mobil, again, later merged with Exxon to form ExxonMobil), of California (Chevron), and so on. In approving the breakup the Supreme Court added the "rule of reason": not all big companies, and not all monopolies, are evil; and the courts (not the executive branch) are to make that decision. To be harmful, a trust had to somehow damage the economic environment of its competitors"

$C: 5 major corporations own all TV & radio. They all spew the same propaganda. 

There is no competition. That's the problem. 

We need anti-monopoly laws to be enforced and strengthened. 
$C: I’m pro competition and I hate Sinclair. But he/she is grouping together monopolistic businesses that are harmful to customers with those that benefit customers. 

Google hasn’t harmed consumers. In fact, its product today is much better than in the early 2000s when there were 10 search engines. It became a dominant search engine because it was a lot better than others, not because Google bought up other competitors.

$C: real trooper
$C: None of that was Fox News. That was local Fox, ABC, CBS, and NBC stations. Not a single clip came from the actual Fox News channel. I get the hate for Fox News, but shit like your comment does nothing but provide a cheap chuckle to distract us from the real problem here by throwing Fox News under the bus.
$C: Pretty ignorant comment. These are independent news stations. (Before this purchase.) they don’t resemble regular Fox News.
$C: I saw a pretty even split between ABC, CBS, and Fox actually... don’t put all the blame on one company, calling out everyone involved in the monopolization of media instead of focusing on more obviously partisan networks is extremely important 
$C: Uh, there was no Fox News in that video.
$C: Fox News is not the same thing as a local Fox affiliate.
$C: Legends have it that he was institutionalized right after publishing this clip. 
$C: They’re a mix of networks.  Fox, ABC, cbs, I didn’t see an NBC but there’s probably one in there.

But sure blame everything on Fox News.
$C: Local fox news isn't that bad, its the fox news channel that is the issue.

$C: I have no idea what that says or is supposed to mean.
$C: All media is playing both ends against the middle, and so many people are falling for it. You can no longer be in the middle, you must pick a side. You must pick a team. Having your own opinions that differ from one side in any way means you're part of the opposition. It is fucked.

$C: Dont worry I've got the video downloaded and im sure many others. YouTube cant stop us from uploading to the various other video streaming/file sharing services.
$C: The thing is that they don't actually delete it, they just make it look like they deleted it. If you successfully fight a false DMCA claim, the video will be put back online, so it was never purged from the servers to begin with. I'm assuming they don't actually purge videos until the period to fight DMCAs has passed.

$C: Local news is still local. Sinclair, who owns a bunch of stations, forces ALL of them to run certain segments. Usually theyre pre-recorded pieces by idiots like Mark Hymen and Boris Epshteyn. This is scary because it makes you THINK it’s the local news station having a little fireside chat with their townsfolk. We have entered a dangerous new phase in American media. Keep an eye on us. You could be next. 
$C: Yeah no please don't generalize like that.  This is tantamount to me saying that all libtards want to steal my guns and let criminals run free. 
$C: What conservatives have you been speaking to?

EDIT: Downvote for question. But it's a good one. This video is currently the top post on /t_d/, so obviously conservatives take serious issue with this. /u/shortnorwegian's judgement of them must be askew to think they must be "proud" of it, and so I was asking where he gets that notion.
$C: >In November 2010, it was reported that five Fox affiliates and one ABC affiliate owned by Sinclair broadcast an infomercial critical of then-President Barack Obama, Breaking Point: 25 Minutes that will Change America, which was sponsored by the National Republican Trust Political Action Group.[174] The infomercial painted Obama as an extremist, and claimed that, during the 2008 presidential campaign, he received some campaign money from the Hamas terrorist group, and that Obama said in a speech, "You want freedom? You’re gonna have to kill some crackers! You gonna have to kill some of those babies." The special also discusses Obama advisers Van Jones and John Holdren, as well as Obama staff Anita Dunn, Kevin Jennings, Carol Browner and Cass Sunstein – all in an unflattering light; in one case, the special claimed that Holdren said that trees should be permitted to sue humans in court. The infomercial aired at various times during the weekend of October 30, 2010 on Sinclair-owned stations in Madison, Cape Girardeau, Lexington, Pittsburgh, Des Moines, and Winston-Salem – all in swing states vital to the 2010 elections.[175][176]

[They essentially *are* a big troll farm.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_Broadcast_Group#Political_views) Only they use local news anchors who have spent decades building trust within their community to spread their bullshit by buying the stations outright.

$C: The global market is massive, the ease of entry is greater with advanced technology, and America has always had a "profits now at the expense of the future" mentality. The rich get richer.

Nothing really has changed as much as its gotten more concentrated and volatile. That volatility benefits the rich and the economy in a vacuum and when it fails they still end up in the 'better.'

You still have power as a consumer though and that's usually the first social responsibility to fall off a person's list of priorities. With enough people not acknowledging their consumer power the economically persuasive get away with abuse and neglect.

I know plenty of people who bitch about the Koche brothers and then go buy their groceries from Wal-Mart. When the people don't stand for their values why on earth would a corporation?



$C: Oligarcal republic disguised as a democracy 
$C: Stop waving flags for a second, he is correct no matter what his own opinions are on politics. This video should be a wake up call to many on how much influence our favorite mediums have on us and how easy it is to game. If everyone took a step back when they heard something inflammatory, thought about who was behind the message and looked at the sources, our political landscape would be much better than it is now. 
$C: Even a moron can tell you that shit stinks.
$C: They are called “must-runs,” and they arrive every day at television stations owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group — short video segments that are centrally produced by the company. Station managers around the country are directed to work them into the broadcast over a period of 24 or 48 hours.

This does not seem like a "must-run" as fake news harms both sides and these clips are made by each station.
$C: Then this video is bad because they are all pushing fake news.
$C: I've done my part.
$C: haha, good thing the market magically fixes this problem just like it fixes all others /s

$C: If Democrats retake the Congress, we can start making headway. 
$C: Well that is some good news. 
$C: I can’t say that I can, especially since I have no idea what non-O&O means.  But yes, agreed that conservative-friendly = Sinclair.
$C: That’s because it IS a decoy. But if you hold that opinion, you’re obviously a Nazi-loving Trump supporter.
$C: They do a terrorism segment that is just about Muslims in general. Sinclair is like fox news.

Cheers lonely guy.
$C: Tagged him from previous threads. Look at his recent post history, currently 50% of his comments are telling people to go vote.
$C: "unsubstantiated"

Ha ha. Right. Let me guess, you're on the "right side of history" with all of your opinions about how other people should think. 
$C: I'm sorry? I'm not really pushing any conspiracy. Its pretty normal for sister stations to run/share the same stories and for parent companies to make their affiliates run things. Didn't advocate for anything one way or another. Not sure I had anything to "debunk" so relax pal. 
$C: Although you make a great point, I don’t even think a radio is a must for talk radio. Even radio broadcasts, I get later on from a podcast. I haven’t listened to radio “seriously” for a long time. 
$C: > but the radio is a must if you like any sort of talk

as a podcast listener..... huh?
$C: >  but the radio is a must if you like any sort of talk.

Umm, you are absolutely wrong, and I *highly* suggest you start looking into different podcasts. You mentioned you enjoy sports talk, and the podcast world is *filled* with sports podcasts. Talk radio is dead too, podcasts killed it a *while* back. If you're into mma, Id just start with the Joe Rogan Experience(or if youre just into interesting discussion, all his guests are from very different fields), and then expand out from there. Or just search people who you like, see if they have a podcast, or see if theyve made any appearances and work from there. Podcasting is the talk radio of the future, and it's uncensored. 
$C: Yeah, we've got one of those too (or possibly the same one; you're not in the Tampa Bay area, are you?) The only stations I listen to are that one and the local NPR station.
$C: .
$C: My college station is good for that. The only two stations that are even listenable are the oldies station and (sometimes)the college station. And Im 25, lol
$C: Yep, been getting the free month since 2013.
$C: *Tonight's program is underwritten by Joe's Automotive, who believes that the arts... No, wait... It just says "Nice try, asshole. You hear me now?" That's Joe's Automotive.*
$C: I believe it's a nickname at the least or subsidiary at the worst. Similar to Comcast branding themselves as "Xfinity". Clear Channel is still running the show.
$C: Do you know who they’re owned by? I’ve worked for a couple different large companies in FM radio that own station clusters across the country and you’d basically get a few warnings and then fired for being politically specific on-air. They don’t want to risk potentially alienating any amount of their listeners in a given area. But I haven’t worked all over the country so I guess it’s probably different in some areas/privately owned stations.
$C: Are you threatening me?
$C: Your station will make a fine addition to my collection.
$C: “LōÓk, I said there was no tre45son, next question!”
$C: To shreds you say?
$C: I see Ajit Pai smile
$C: Not if appropriate legislation is enacted.
$C: The Bell Telephone Company has some words about that. When a decision is actually reached, the fixes are relatively timely.
$C: >  reporting narratives approved by the 1%

What do you by this?


$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipsPgNEmAXI
$C: The UHF loophole deal and relaxing of such regulations did. Yes, large ownership groups have been gobbling up the little guys, or the little guys have been merged to form bigger guys, mostly to be a bigger presence at the table for negotiations regarding retransmission rights and affiliation agreements, but they all knew they had to stay under that 39% cap. So, it was more a matter of getting the station ownership/viewership map right so you could get as many little stations as you could while still staying under the cap. Sinclair figured this one out quickly and was the first currently to hit cap.

And then it twisted some arms to get UHF changed (it’s technically a “discount,” so the audience under a UHF station is like counted for half the population it actually is). UHF discount used to be a thing, as it did have less audience potential, but that has changed in the digital world, so Sinclair used an old rule, when its obviously not the 80’s anymore. 

So yeah, that part? The only reason they’d ever be able to by Trib? Yeah, that’s them. And Ajit Pai being more than happy to make it happen. 
$C: Do you care to elaborate on which company owned 72 percent of stations before Ajit Pai?
$C: Oh no, I'm sorry :(
$C: > doesn't look bad, though

Wow. Just wow.

What’s worse is that this isn’t really very similar to anything the Nazis did. The Nazis didn’t monopolize local cable news stations in order to spread scripted anti-internet propaganda. This is new ground. These are new problems. The right uses Nazi tactics sometimes, more lately, but this isn’t that.

Here is thread about Bell silencing advertising efforts of advocacy group https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/84hdwz/radio_stations_are_refusing_to_run_our_ads/

TL'DR: Bell and other big media giants are pressuring the CRTC (Canadian Radio and Television Committee) to introduce bill which allows Canadian ISPs to block piracy and illegal streaming sites with little oversight. Outright censorship of the internet and creates a slippery slope of what we have access to and can view online. 

CRTC opened up discussion and polls to gain public reaction and the polls are now closed so its now all up to whatever report/conclusion they come up with whether they want to introduce this SOPA style bill to parliament 
$C: Don't pretend that this sort of thing is confined only to television broadcasts. There has been a crazy amount of consolidation in the newspaper industry over the past decade, as Torstar and Postmedia amalgamate and shut down papers everywhere, fire journalists and liquidate newsrooms, print anonymized editorials across their properties, and push fairly specific political agendas into spaces that used to be devoted to local news.

I live in a community that used to have three local papers, all with distinct editorial positions, but because of mergers and increased pressures from other sources (ie. Tv, internet), there's now only one. The worst part is that I can drive to my parent's house, about 60km and four or five communities away, and get the exact same editorial content and the same feature articles.

$C: Does your nihilism make it easier for you to sleep at night? 

Anyway, yes, voting has consequences. Supporting politicians who will rein in companies does in fact help. For example, the Obama administration created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which the GOP (who are owned wholesale by the Mercers & Kochs) is now trying to destroy it. 

We need new antitrust legislation to break up Comcast, AT&T, the Koch group, the Mercer group, the Sinclair group, etc. It can be done. It has been done in the past. Let's do it again. 

Vote!
$C: As much as I want to believe votes will change this, I know deep down that it's too late for that. There's too many players on strings and bottomless pockets in the game to let our democracy be for the people. Hell, a disturbing amount of the "people" don't even understand that what they've been told to stand for isn't even close to being in their best interest. But the game is so advanced at this point that it's going to be very hard to come back from without some form of revolution.
$C: Because they totally don't lock people away for Facebook posts now...
$C: That’s what is said, but the truth is that more laws imposed on law-abiding gun owners don’t actually do anything for the crime rate. That was proven in the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 which was not renewed in 2004 due to being ineffective. And the same people who want stricter gun rights don’t actually realize what the second amendment is for, fighting against corrupt and tyrannical government.
$C: Man, it doesn’t make sense to me. First, a common question I hear when I say I am pro-gun is as follows: “but that was created so the people of the US could form a militia if need be to overthrow a tyrannical government” and that this means that having guns isn’t exactly my right. Then I see this, where people are questioning someone’s thought to form a militia in the future to overthrow a tyrannical government that is in the works already, even though before it was said that it was his right in the constitution to do so. I mean voting for people who aren’t asshats will help, but in the long run the people do need to have some sort of right to self preservation. Whether it be from other people or from a tyrannical government I don’t know, but sadly both are seeming to exist in this day and age. 
$C: I certainly am. If my fellow people are being taken and abused/murdered by tyrannical government, I’d rather die than stand idly by, waiting for my turn. The people must be ready, and that is what the second amendment was made for.
$C: Millennial in a blue state, watching the Loyola game. Don’t be naive, you’re the one believing propaganda now. 
$C: You must be really naive to consider any interpretation other than to prevent tyranny.

$C: People keep saying sensible, but what does that really mean? It’s a buzz word to make it sound more benign, but any gun laws that take firearms away from law-abiding citizen is an infringement on the second amendment. People need to realize that this is an extremely important thing, and without it, tyrannical government can form, and faster than you think.
$C: >No, that's not true. You're a child murderers if you kill children. You're a child murderer enabler if you don't support more sensible regulations on gun control.

There it is. 
$C: Yes, but this is not "Orwellian" or even close to it. This is just an example of teenagers who just read 1984 and now see "Orwellian" literally everywhere.
$C: ...Trump? What does Trump have to do with this?
$C: Because in the same way these news stations are parroting views, people are buying upvotes and pushing stories on that sub and many others, and even manufacturing comments to fit their narrative. I don't know how many times people have to demonstrate it before people take it seriously as a huge issue. It's been common knowledge for years, and some guys made a video and article about how easy it is like a year or two ago. You can buy a front page post for like a couple hundred bucks, and manufacture a narrative in the comments for a little more.
$C: Because this kind of brainwashed controll exists in Reddit subs as well
$C: Yeah! Let the government control the news. That's the way to do it. Give them complete control of the press. While we're at it, let's rewrite the first amendment, for funsies.

I hope you realize what you're advocating.

$C: Wow, that was really fascinating. We’re definitely playing hopscotch with the line between democracy and oligarchy. I wonder if this cycle will play out faster than it has in the past, considering the greater rate of change in the modern world compared to antiquity. 

Already we’re seeing glimpses from the monarchy/tyranny stage - like the red hats’ utter devotion to Trump, his demands for personal loyalty, and his overall feeling that the rules don’t apply to him.
$C: The FCC regulation on newspaper and TV station ownership was not burdensome
$C: Some regulation does. I'm not claiming all regulations are good. It'd be reductive to claim that they are all good or bad. Obviously we need to consider them on their own merit. It's mentally easy to just hope that all problems resolve themselves on their own over time if left alone, but there are many many cases where that's not true.
$C: You chose one of the worst examples. Airlines are extremely regulated, it's why they're so safe.

$C: Fucking deregulate us back into fuedalism, except instead of kings, queens, and barons, it's companies, sister companies, and subsidiaries.
$C: The point of a society is that we can specialize. That means I don't need to be a mechanic in order to own a car. It also means we can choose people to regulate things so I don't die of food poisoning at a restaurant. 

We need regulators. Vote for them in November 2018!
$C: I shouldn't need a law degree to understand the hundreds of ways I'm getting fucked in my life. It shouldn't be a full time job.
$C: I agree with you in principle but the truth is we have too many consumers with too many needs and wants. The chain from supply to consumption is so complex and terrible that a consumer would need to be unreasonably well informed about their options in order to make a choice that isn't terrible either way. 

Its on the supply side. We need to make the people *with power* use it reasonably.

$C: So just block all tracking and don't login.  Or use incognito mode.  It's not going to keep you safe, but at least it won't know what bubble you're in.
$C: Well, Google does cater to their users' browsing habits, it doesn't mean that every other search engine does.

Also, reminder that duckduckgo's bangs save me a couple dozen clicks everyday. Try "!a stuff" and you'll land on the Amazon search page for "stuff", and it works for *lots* of websites. 
$C: It should be, but it never has. It's been better, certainly. The creation of Fox News was the introduction of seditionist propaganda into mainstream media, but the news had never given us the full and accurate story.
$C: I can see that. Also makes sense why so many are putting personal feelings above all else.

$C: ....didn’t it just have a reunion? Come on, Duchovney’s not dead, I just saw him in a new episode of Red Shoe Diaries =P
$C: Did you even watch it?
$C: There's still tons. The old print media that's adapted to being online is generally still of high quality. TV news is alright as long as you avoid the 24 hour news stations and opinion shows. AP and Reuters, etc.
$C: The Guardian, BBC, NPR, The NY Times, and the Washington Post come to mind.
$C: The bigger news oultets are pretty good journalism wise. Just don’t read any of the opinion or editorials and you’ll be fine. Also make sure you’re not just reading from one source to get as close to the full picture as possible.
$C: *le both sides* XD

cspan for instance
$C: [Currently 193 stations in 89 markets.](http://sbgi.net/) If I remember correctly they do local news in around 70 of those markets, I can't find the actual number right now though.
$C: We already have one Sinclair station in St. Louis and if the Tribune buyout is approved, we’ll have 2, it’s a scary prospect.
$C: I know they're seperate. By "...And Co" I mean the other media conglomerates. They all have their own agenda, it's just Murdochs whose shines through. 
$C: It wasn't me saying TV news needs to die, but this (the clip involved) is worse than being uninformed. At least then you're not being manipulated to follow the opinions pushed by stations. As for the "Hear about it no matter what", I'm talking of the major events such as terrorist attacks or natural disasters. I get what you're saying though, It's just less and less news channels seem to be unbiased and reputable now. 
$C: But are they genuine?
$C: Oh lol, whoosh!
$C: On average how many generations does an empire last? I've heard many have existed for a similar length of time, but I cant remember where I read it.
$C: That is good for people to have, I used an online video converter to put it on my phone without needing youtube.
$C: > There's nothing wrong with wapo, npr, nytimes, etc

Yes there is. There *absolutely* is.
$C: This. And honestly I doubt the mods of the major subs like this are aware of exactly *who* the other mods are. Shit, they could have a Sinclair employee or some other media manipulator or interest on the board and they would never know. You think the mods are vetted in real life? You think media giants aren't aware of Reddit and its influence?

$C: sometimes I genuinely hate redditors. Y'all are some snooty, self-righteous pricks sometimes. I'm not, nor have I ever been, a typo-maker but if this is how you guys attack someone you perceive as being a typo-maker, I honestly don't blame some of them at all for saying "fuck it, burn it all down and start again." I have close loved ones that proudly make typos because they really thought anything else was better than the status quo. Their opinion was that the US was fucked. It fucking is. But they tried. Just like us non typo-makers. We tried to beat the system even with OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE that no grammar nazi can win.

So they were tricked. Ok. They (most of them) get it. Belittling and chastising is not how you teach. It only causes them to double down in defense when they don't feel they're welcome to switch sides. We were straight up cheated by the dictionary but there ain't much stink about that anymore, is there? We really need to work on our fucking welcome wagon. Sweep our own damn porch before we claim to be the typers of acceptance.

Get the hell out of my messages. I'm done with Reddit for the day.

$C: >It didn’t run nearly as frequently as the anchor ones. It maybe aired a few times. The anchor versions aired every day this week, every show. 

Wow, I thought they were sporadic based on John Oliver's reporting. Every  day for every show is terrifying.
$C: Oh. For some reason I though that this was a one time thing, I didn’t realize they repeated the broadcast
$C: We could start our own sub reddit for videos
$C: STILL LOOKING???
$C: That sounds an awful lot like propaganda, mister.
$C: They also play and peoples emotions and use selective or biased data to promote their agenda. When they can successfully intermingle "science" and emotion as a driving factor, they get most. Read your Edward Bernays kids.
$C: It's divide and conquer, more like it. Push people really far left or right, and let them fight each other instead of the people trying to take advantage of them.
$C: It's ok to torture civilians and spy on all your citizens. In fact, it's unavoidable! It cannot be changed, ever, so why even think about it? Hey look, Wonder Woman 2 is out! Along with all the other intellectual property you remember from the 80s. Go enjoy your nostalgia and forget about today, tomorrow, or really anything other than those delicious refreshments.
$C: Have you ever been to history class? The Japanese were never going to surrender, they would have brought the war to a full scale land-invasion which would lose MILLIONS of Japanese and American lives... dropping those nukes were the only thing that put them in their place.

Right-winger (you) steps in to claim that left wingers are REALLY the ones who accuse the right of the under-handed shit they do themselves.

Checks post history: Regular The_Donald poster. As I figured.
$C: They’re referring to everyone else. So long as you get their news (ie their “truth”) from them, it’s everyone else who is “fake news”, even though fake news is the bullshit they peddle. 

It’s extremely aggravating to see, like a wife beater earnestly telling the cops that, “no officers, I’ve no idea what happened but rest assured I will do everything in my power to find out”. 
$C: The actual fake news mostly comes from the right. They combat this by claiming the opposite.
$C: > So who are they actually referring to when they are talking about fake news online?

Seriously? No one. It's a buzzword they use to ignore news they don't like. It's directed at whoever it needs to be in the moment. 

Anyone outside their bubble is fake news.

Unless you're asking about the original, real definition. And that's spoof websites pretending to be news to spread entirely fake stories (the pope endorsed trump!) for ad revenue clicks.
$C: The "deep state" right wing boogeyman that allows you to ignore news stories that don't fit the GOP narrative.

This mini-manifesto that theyre reading was written by Kristine Frazao, former Russian propaganda artist for RT (before her rise to prominence at Sinclair.) 
$C: It's a dogwhistle for CNN and the like(but not Fox News). Those aren't competition since this is local news and that's cable news.
$C: I'm pretty sure you didn't read my post at all.
$C: Try the search again with incognito or private browsing on. You’ll likely get different results. Google tries to tailor your results to you but it can create a dangerous information bubble.
$C: I did the same search and got results from nearly every major news outlet, but Fox was easily outnumbered the rest, with 6 links on the first page. I don't read Fox. 0 results from HuffPost or Salon on the first page.

What point are you trying to prove?
$C: Sigh.

The "parent network" is the national broadcaster.  The local affiliate has exclusive rights to the parent's programming.  This means things like national news, primetime sitcom programming, etc.

However, the parent network does not own the station.  At all.  They do not have any control over the station.  The station is probably owned by Sinclair.  The local station produces some of its own content, particularly the local news program.  Sinclair has editorial control over that news program.  

Sinclair is not the "parent network" here.  I did, in fact, watch the video.  Did you actually read my post before farting out this all caps response?
$C: Which is Sinclair, lol.
$C: ...by Sinclair, yes.

Not by CBS, ABC, etc. except in cases where they're owned by the network, which is usually only in major markets.
$C: Your name accurately describes yourself. 
$C: I'm not on any "side".  People who think there are sides are what's ruining this country.
$C: Except in this case, there isn't.

Both sides are the same is lazy and factually wrong. Unless you can actually find a counter example, don't just assume there is one.
$C: Interestingly, the wording of all those articles is remarkably similar, sort of like this exact video.

It's also like the 'gamers are dead' mantra. 

I bet there's a gamejournopros group out there, but for regular media folk.
$C: Opinions opinions opinions. very nice. glad you had them all ready to paste too.
$C: That is one of the laziest rebuttal I've ever head and I will use the exact same amount of effort it took to write it to argue against it.
$C:  It always is man. Don't you know, *their* team doesn't do it?
$C: So, which left wing broadcast company is buying up and scripting local news stations? 
$C: Local affiliates haven’t been bought in droves by left wing figures the way right wing figures have been doing though. 
$C: Yes.... you agree with me. 

>The majority of people consume whatever information fits their biases first and foremost,

People are less bias to those people that are from the same place as themselves. 

$C: Yeah, he implied as a secretary of an administration appointment. He was not appointed, because he was unqualified in government administration. That’s the difference between Republicans & Democrats. Being successful at business does not make you good at being a government administrator. 
$C: That's why I mentioned US oligarchs and their pet industries. Republican party is heavily in bed with automotive, military, and a massive chunk of the energy sector. Dem party is in bed with entertainment, IT, and I would heavily argue medical. So US government is literally a battleground between the interests of these two industry groupings.
$C: So what's Mueller been doing then with all these indictments and subpoenas then?

$C: I totally agree about the uncanny valley thing. That's also partially why I was never truly comfortable with Obama. The way he delivered his speeches -- nobody talks like that. Nobody actually has that cadence. It reminded me of a (really, really talented) TV news anchor. 
$C: > That's kinda everyone's stance.

I don't think that's really the case.  You can make an argument that media (and overall corporate) collusion on this level undermines the very ability for our type of government to work as it should and breaking things up is necessary.  I don't think you can argue that people having too much sugar or vaping or any number of other things people want government to micromanage are necessary for society.  There's a lot of people that openly want to use government to impose their wills on others.

And a downvote without reply...says it all...
$C: > The regulations in place promote corporatism.

Sure, in some contexts you could probably make that argument.

But in this current context, we *had* a regulation that limited the scope of a single company to at most 39% of the market, and the issue is getting bigger because that regulation was removed. How on earth is, "you can't control over X% market share" a regulation that *causes* monopoly?
$C: Government bailouts make sense, but how would an unrestricted market stop subsidies and tax exemptions?  

I'm not sure I buy into the idea that "no rules" is going to get us better than this.  I'm interested in anything you or anyone with knowledge of it would have to substantiate this idea.


$C: A corporation would strive to completely control the market through Monopoly without bailouts, subsidies, tax incentives, etc..  Don't confuse or distract anti-trust regulations with rampant corporatism.  The government, well run, is the only entity with the public interest in mind.  Free market forces don't give a shit about public well being: only profits.
$C: pushing a false equivalency is right winger astroturfing strategy since 2016
$C: This should be it’s own post. 
$C: *cites

and also remind me when did John Oliver buy 200 local media stations and make them all play the same politicized message?
$C: It's 2018 !!!
$C: > Why would anybody listen to anything he said at all?

Why wouldn't I? In spite of the post about local news channels owned by sinclair which got 100k+ upvotes today, you throw shade on john oliver?!
$C: *tips redcap* M'AGA m'pede
$C: Give an example of a single time he's said something objectively false.

Go ahead. It'll take a LOT more effort than finding the same thing said by Trump or FOX news. Oliver is one of the most honest and accurate people in the media.

Take the plunge and actually WATCH the segment about Sinclair. Open your mind for a few minutes.

Edit: fastest I've ever been downvoted. What a closed-minded, fragile little troll you are.
$C: What I said is entirely accurate.  Either provide something of substance or go fly a kite.
$C: Ok first let’s start with advertising: Markets with sports teams bring in lots of money, especially for the station that airs the game. But the biggest single advertising source in most markets is car dealership advertising. Not like the general GM or Ford ads, but Family Car Dealer! Selling cars with an over-excited family spokesperson for 40 years! 

That’s why so many stations took hits in 2007-8. The great automotive bailout helped out stations in a way. It spread along the whole car manufacturing web, and in that, local tv stations. 

Many stations also budget in the political ad boost (especially every 4 years, but in between, too). The internet didn’t steal ad money as much as you’d think, either, as stations “push” viewers to their own websites for views, so they can catch the latest snow closing list or whatever. And how many times has your aunt shared some puppy dog article on Facebook from a market not her own? Ad eyeballs right there. 

People were laid off, in the Great Recession, sure. Not all of them were on air, either. A great many Photogs, producers, production staff, and other departments were offered “buyouts” or were pretty much cut. Mostly because their 30 years of experience was expensive. In some cases, like production staff, they were replaced by evolving technology. At one time, maybe 20 years ago, each show would have three operators, one for each studio camera. Then, about 15 years ago, they laid off two, kept the one, who operated all the cameras from one station. Then, within the last five years, larger markets began embracing “automation,” where you need maybe 2 or 3 people tops, who all-together direct, switch, put up graphics, control audio, run prompter, floor direct, and run cameras. So there’s some personnel cuts there. 

I say larger markets, because smaller markets have been doing such cheap practices for years. Another thing they’ve been doing for years is using OMBs (One Man Bands): one person that shoots their own story and reports it, rather than a two-person team of reporter and photog. As older, more expensive reporters and Photogs took the buyouts, got laid off, or were attritioned out (especially contract staff on that last one, once their contract was out, they just weren’t resigned) they were replaced by the much MUCH cheaper OMBs, with varying degrees of experience. Am I saying that’s a good thing for overall content and coverage? Not necessarily, but the bean counters loved it, especially in the more expensive larger markets. 

Another form of cost cutting was travel. A lot of stations would send their most esteemed reporter to some far-off news just for because. But the ownership groups would pool resources and cut back. Why should a crew from Iowa have to travel down to the Gulf Coast to cover a hurricane, when the same owners have a station in Alabama? Just let that crew cover it and use in-company networks to file-share the video to all the sister stations. 

As for providing scripts to on-air talent... what do you think producers have been doing for decades? Producers write the lead-ins, the national or regional stories, and the anchors read them on air. The anchors can go and put together their own stories and projects and present them if their show schedules allow and they’re not tied to the desk. Sometimes, they’ll write stories to help the producers out. The reporters write their own scripts and stories and present those. None of that has been affected by budget cuts.

Now, there’s also the issue of higher retransmission fees. Retrans is, basically: stations get a cut from the local cable companies, of what cable charges their customers for subscription. It’s paying the station for their content in that cable package. But if the station is a network affiliate, say, the local ABC, then not all of that content is theirs, so they must turn around and pay some of that retrans money to ABC, to cover for like the prime time shows. 

The networks are HUGE, monetarily. They’re the biggest dog in the room. In the largest markets, they straight out own their “affiliates,” called O&Os (Owned and Operated). WNBC is the NYC NBC O&O, as is WMAQ in Chicago and KNBC in LA. But even the networks can’t own them all. 

A lot of these companies, the smaller or mid-level ones, are trying to merge up to become bigger negotiating threats in the room, just for the retrans money. Bigger better say to keep more of that pie, because it IS needed. That’s how Sinclair, Nexstar, Gannett, etc got so or pretty big.  (Only Sinclair tries to push such and agenda, and only Sinclair is proud of such a thing).

Sometimes, though, the retrans negotiations fall out. Sometimes they affect the affiliation agreements, something that used to be 15-year contracts, now are lucky to be 5-year. 
And, when those negotiations go south, the stations loose that affiliation, or a swap happens. 

There are stations in Jacksonville, Phoenix, and Indianapolis that are largely independent, or have affiliations with “lesser” groups (not the big three or Fox) and they’re all doing very well. Many of them have found that expanding news shows in the day is pretty cheap to produce, compared to subscribing to syndicated shows, but people do love a good game show, judge show, L&O rerun. AND they don’t have to give their first born to the network in retrans fees. Some stations even with affiliation have started producing their own Oprah-like lifestyle shows (one show in Davenport, IA, has been airing for about 30 years) and a station in Ohio even dabbled in a local reality show. How great the shows are is questionable, but there’s an audience and they’re very cheap to produce, compared to syndication or network programming. 

I’m not saying the industry is perfect. There are issues they’re grappling to adapt to, and each station or group has its own ways of adaptation. Sometimes they’re re-figuring out that you’ve got to spend money to make money, or that some ideas that were super cost saving in the short term cost more in the long term (many many stations started using “back pack” transmitters instead of live trucks. Less vehicle upkeep, less receiver tower upkeep. And then they get their cell phone bill—the things run on like 8 cell cards—or a natural disaster wipes out cell towers, and suddenly those live trucks don’t seem so bad). 

It’s not dying. In fact, with all the nonsense out there now, local news is still deemed pretty center and trustworthy. Most people don’t really question what they’re being told (because usually it’s very much the truth, and that staff lives right there in their community, they’re neighbors). That’s what makes Sinclair so dangerous. They’re way too close to destroying that trust and that’s bad for everyone.


$C: Yep, better to let things decline naturally. Journalism will still survive on Youtube, etc. If someone is really principled, they can leave the TV station like Cenk Uygur did.

Edit: a word
$C: People like to gripe about "state funded propaganda" and whatnot, but you know what state-sponsored media actually looks like? The BBC.

Honestly, I'd love it if the US instated a kind of constitutionally mandated news agency (or better, 2 or 3), and treated them as an actual "fourth branch", set up in a way to make it not dependent on politics or advertising or donations to continue operation.
$C: No. Admittedly I don't watch fox news, however, some youtubers occasionally cover their segments. And around 10% of the time, Fox is actually good.
$C: stop...
$C: Alright. Then I should probably get around to reading it sometime. 
$C: Again, it's not meant to be taken literally though. And no, are you really insinuating an entire media conglomerate repeating one line to make it's viewers think that everything they read anti-conservative is fake news isn't even a little bit manipulative? it's word by word the same across all their channels. It doesn't matter if they're state run or not, for most they're the main source of news available to them. 
$C: Yea, everyone is saying how trump is a cult of personality and I’m sitting here like hello did everyone suddenly forget about obama 
$C: It's also pretty easy to be a great president when you save the economy, stop a healthcare nightmare from occurring, keep the country safe, and do it all with the utmost professionalism and respect. But that being said, I doubt you'll find anyone here who will actually say Obama was "perfect." The Dems don't have a /r/the_donald. Criticism of our leaders is allowed and fosters debate.  

The people who say the media didn't criticize him are wrong. CNN and MSNBC took Obama to task all the time, The Daily Show and Colbert did it all the time, everyone did. They have 24 hours of news to fill, they had to. There simply was less to criticize. And the "any disagreement is racism!" thing is a bullshit right wing persecution fantasy. The right was proven inarguably to be largely either racist or okay with racism in this last election. You were getting called racists because you were racists, time has shown. 

Oh cool, here comes the t_d vote brigade. What that I said was wrong? I'd love to hear it. 
$C: Except for, say, dropping an incredible amount of drone bombs on brown kids, and prosecuting ONE person for Wall Street’s crimes during the financial crisis, (plus a lot more TBH.)

In reality, the far left media just mythologizes Obama.  He’s their Ronald Regan.  
$C: Facebook. 
$C: I like how, in the face of evidence of countless news stations reading from the same script, people still consider things like a White House administration 'controlling' the news to be unfathomable.
$C: I think you're taking his statement a little too literally, guy
$C: >  it's your side

I dont think hes the problem - he never mentioned a side. 

America needs to wake the fuck up and realise its not about 'sides'. Both of your 'sides' are fucking terrible.
$C: indeed, and this is something the intellectual left, which has been marginalized almost completely from the american political sphere, has been talking about for 50 years. 

Noam chomssky predicted this situation with eerie precision in his  book "manufacturing consent", which gives an almost mechanical explanation about how corporate owned news leads to this situation.

Trump is just doing taking a page off the fascist playbook: find flaws in the democracy's sources of information, and then claim that all information that doesn't benefit him personally is tainted. the truth is that you always have to be on alert as to the source of your information, and that understanding your particular source's conflicts of interests can tell you which topics of theirs to avoid, but Trump just tells you that everything that he doesn't like is fake news. 

For example, if a local journalist on an NBC station does an expose on a local politician, it probably contains quite a lot of truth, as a small time politician is not going to have that much control over this corporation. However, NBC is owned by GE which manufactures weapons, so any piece related to American war efforts is going to be biased by their financial stake in the military-industrial complex.

$C: So I heard a story once about Cargo Cults.  That's where you had these cultists in backwards third world countries build these fake airport runways in the belief that if you build it they will come.  That putting down these airstrips will cause planes to land and bring all the modern goods and services that you're told exist in the western world.

It becomes pretty obvious pretty quickly that the runways don't work.  No planes land.  It's fake after all.  But the trick of the leader isn't making the cultists believe that it would work.  It's making the cultists believe that all the other runways in the world are just as fake.  They're all lying about it.

What Trump, Fox, and their ilk are doing is undermining belief in institutions that we KNOW work.  Fox is clearly biased and they don't hide it.  What they're convincing other people is that EVERY media outlet is just as biased and you don't have to believe their "facts" because they're lying to you just like Fox.

That's the trick.  That's the fucked up part of Fox news.  And it's sad to see it working on people.
$C: Love him or hate him, Trump is the man who finally ended the myth of "neutral and objective" news reporting and outed the media for their respective partisan colors.

That in all honesty will probably be his greatest legacy.
$C: This video in no way reinforces what the blowhard in chief has said.

Trump and his cronies are in fact responsible for Sinclair broadcasting propaganda being spread as demonstrated in this video

$C: It is true.
$C: Daily reminder that you're a retard for thinking a podunk nowhere town in Alabama represents the US for one exceptional case
$C: I swear agent provocateurs like you are popping up everywhere. Maybe stop being a caricature and your hijinks would be more believable. 
$C: You're a joke. 
$C: Do they openly discriminate?  The BBC does.

Not that that would have anything to do with press freedom, just saying.
$C: That was a surprise to me as well but youd probably find its because its a federal law that you cant own more than two media licenses in one area in Australia. 

Not only that but you cant own television licenses that reach more than 75% of the population and foreign ownership can't reach more than 20%.

Though I heard a rumour they were going to remove that law :/.
$C: PBS is better than all the US national news media
$C: So the government holds the finances, but doesn't control the station?  C'mon.
$C: Not sure why you are so hostile. All of those are charges. Poloce can be dumb and arrest people for stupid shit but I would be surprised if a judge actually followed through with a conviction on any of those. The UK story I was referring to the guy was convicted for making his dog do Nazi salutes. Didn't need a source I thought because it was common knowledge. Sorry...
$C: You'll have to tell historians about it. It's a breakthrough finding such an unknown civilization.
$C: That's not how it works. 

Nestle puts its parent name on products for recognition and brand familiarity. It has other brands and products under the main parent brand. I'm not aware of any laws or regulations that _force_ them to place the Nestle name on product lines or brands that they opt not to.

For a parallel example, Clear Channel rebranded to iHeartMedia because CC was so widely hated. It was still CC, but they hoped the rebranding would wipe away the ire towards their practices. 

Go figure, the same things that people disliked about CC were also front and center under iHM. And now it's falling apart.

Sinclair is the same way. I'm not aware that want or need to be subversive. They don't have any business need or reason to hide their affiliation. To them, it's a badge of pride - so why wouldn't they make sure that the public knows that they're a Sinclair entity? 

Additionally, it's common practice in the industry for the website for a station to identify and state who their parent company is. It's also part of the copyright at the end of broadcasts as well as station IDs. 

I'm not aware of any Sinclair entities that are trying to hide it. 
$C: False equivalence when I've given an example of a video extremely similar to the posted video? They might not be listed as the same companies, but they definitely get direction from the same place. I don't understand why you would find the posted video outrageous but find the one I posted acceptable. And I dont find it acceptable either way, whether its sinclair or anyone else.
$C: Why would I be mad about a low effort commissioned hit piece from the left that only makes them seem even more retarded than usual?

Enjoy Trump 2020 btw
$C: You are blind to your own biases.
$C: Well, the manipulated media in question is the Sinclair group, a far right media organization, so yes, the problem shown above is instigated by conservative groups
$C: This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.

edit: by that I mean it sucks Narwhal doesn't show the source title at all. I had to open my app and confirm what you said.
$C: Because there's no reason why a company would designate a lighthearted Christmas present story as a "must run" piece.

Stations just picked the Christmas present story because consumer and holiday stories generally do well.
$C: How is it neo-nazi propaganda, 'specifically'?  I'd be more ok with the 'punching Nazis' schtick if you people were even half-decent at knowing what the fuck a Nazi actually is.  
$C:  < I'd argue the Democrats are much the same.

Wait, the Democrats (who made a dumb choice by pushing a non-charismatic candidate President), are "much the same" as Fox News and the Republicans (who have abandoned science, attacked the notion of objective fact, and used Putin's attempts to undermine our democracy for their own gain)? 

That simply makes no sense to me. It's like marrying a serial killer because your other option has bad breath. 
$C: Social security, medicare, minimum wage, the EPA, the Civil Rights Act. Are those the decades when you are saying the US was dysfunctional? We used to be capable of passing legislation that actually helped people. Now we are arguing about whether we should expect our President to tell the truth and not conspire with Russia against the American public. You're really telling me that things were worse back then?
$C: Exactly. The irony of his comment lol
$C: Look, you might be happy that Russia bolstered the Republicans this time around.

But the next time it could be China or the EU using the full power of their intelligence apparatus to boost the Democrats. You won't be so happy about it then. 
$C: They apologized for the no go zones story.

You HAVE to allow for redactions and apologies because every once in a while EVERY news source gets it wrong. I subscribe to 2 newspapers. WaPo and NYTs. They are the 2 best papers with the best reporting around. If I held them to a perfect standard, in a take it or leave it fashion, I'd have to leave it. They have also been wrong. Is Fox on the same level? Fuck no. Fox is propoganda. My point is that they aren't Infowars. They aren't Brietbart. They aren't the dailycaller. They generally try to hold themselves to a reasonable standard. Even crazy Sean Hannity had to let go of the Seth Rich nonsense and he  isn't news. He's an opinion show.

I know you hate Fox. We all do. But they aren't the fake news culprits that you're looking for. Shitty? Yes. Bias? Absolutely. Good awful? No doubt. Fake? No.
$C: It's an opinion piece from Hannity. Not a news segment and he agreed to stop talking about it.
$C: Except it's not, so it really doesn't matter what it "sounds like" to you. 

I know, it sucks that facts have a well known liberal bias. 

$C: Right, and while public policy opinions rarely have the factual backing that scientific certainties such as the spherical shape of the earth do, there are clearly some opinions that are respectable and some that are not.  To entertain every opinion just because it exists is asinine -- that type of mindset can be (and has been) taken advantage of on reddit, where those bringing forth opinions do so in bad faith as a means to distract and change the subject.  If you don't believe me, try it yourself -- it's easier than you think to derail an otherwise fruitful conversation and it happens all the time.
$C: Do you respect my opinion or do you respect my right to have an opinion.  Those are two completely separate things.
$C: lol, they say that exact line in the video
$C: I have no idea what you just wrote.
$C: Anybody who claims any journalism is unbiased is pushing a much worse kind of propaganda. 
$C: "Is Donald Trump a US citizen? He didn't even make his tax returns public like every other presidential candidate for the past 40 years! Was he born in Kenya? Is he a Muslim? More at 6"

Get the hell out of here. Fox news is definitely one of the worst news outlets in the US. 
$C: hahaha I agree that being liberal is being moderate or centrist.  I agree with progressives' policy so Im farther left.  If ya interested in independents on the right; only one I know is 'Hard Bastard' on YT
$C: I don't recommend democracynow to people
$C: > I understand how their practices arn't the same as FOX.
$C: Russia??? Russia is a conspiracy theory just like Seth Rich. Take your bias glasses off man.
$C: > Is it out of a need to have an equivalent on both sides to feel like you're being fair? 

Sort of, it’s a defensive strategy.  Right wing media has been programming us for a long time to believe in the whole “fair and balanced” line.  If there’s a thing on one side, there needs to be an equal and opposite thing on the other side.  Once this sweeps into the nation’s mental groundwater, you get really weird shit like people accusing Rachel Maddow of being the Alex Jones of the left.

Basically, if there are two things, and you like the one that’s worse than the other, it’s very much in your interest to try to convince yourself and everyone else that they’re basically the same thing.  Donny boy spent a bunch of taxpayer money on media analysis following the story where he cheated on his wife with a porn star?  But Obama spent money on research too!  Then you leave out the huge, huge differences in those two situations, and now you have a fair and balanced argument about why trump is no worse than anyone else.
$C: Daily show, it's spinoffs, Maher are left leaning. Plenty of material on both sides. But to say a comedy show pulling material more from fox is indicative of one side's over-abundance of ridiculous narrative and talking points is naive. 
$C: Care to provide proof about your second paragraph?
$C: Oh its not just tv media that is garbage. Its good to be skeptical about all political news. Not to mention all politicians are just propagandists too.
$C: Not quite sure how a few satirical remarks makes the proof of bias I posted irrelevant.
$C: Forgot what post you are commenting under? 


> This is what happens when one company owns dozens of local news stations

$C: It pretty much did. Look it up yourself the 1% is pretty much all Jews 
$C: Nazis? Yeah I heard of them 
$C: That's the nice thing, you can click on the tag and it will take you to their post which caused the script to tag them. Really easy to check for false positives.

The "Moderator Toolbox for Reddit" browser extension is really handy too, it puts a little "H" (history) button next to everyone's username that you can quickly click to see where they post and comment to. [Here's what that looks like for the guy you replied to](https://imgur.com/a/yqKwY)... You can also click on any of the subreddits and it will automatically search that sub for [posts by that user](https://www.reddit.com/r/milliondollarextreme/search?q=author%3AMrJohnBongo&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&feature=legacy_search)... yikes, you weren't kidding. This guy is an asshole.
$C: I hope you apply this same practice online.. Lurk outside the donald every once and a while and see what people are talking about. Social media bubbles are just as bad as MSM.
$C: I can say you are one of the rare ones if you are seeking both sides of the story.

I went to T_D and only saw

>	“This is Obama - Reddit just figured it out and blames trump, reeee”

Type comments. I wanted to ask questions but I’ve been perma banned from T_D for debating points in the comments (Also known as trolling there, or as stated by the mod, I was banned because my question belongs in ask T_D.

So my question to you, how is this not controlling what T_D see’s on a daily basis? Applied by the same mods who claim free speech is under attack? 


Edit: when I asked he mods why I was banned this is word for word the answer I got:

>	lol. You are not a trump supporter


And then he muted me. It’s okay to ask/answer question here btw you won’t get banned. We don’t have an r/Ask_Not_The_Donald


Edit 2: You seemed all genuine before I checked your comment history. Seems like a normal teenage kid until...


>	and its in the name of T_D that its a sub for Trump Supporters. We have a sub for people to question are beliefs politely. Theres no reason for a Bernie supporter to be on T_D other than trolling. The fact that y’all can’t deal with the fact that there are subs with opposing opinions than you guys is sad and adds to the term “snowflake” that y’all are often given


Oh so now it’s okay to censor your sub from opposing views? Are you just here to troll? I don’t think so, the same way you say the Bernie’s are.

Makes no sense in contrast with your above comment.

Seems to me you fit your own definition of snowflake: Can’t handle opposing views so you take shelter in your echo chamber


Edit 3: After reading some more I think this guy highlights the problem - Ironic given he claims the opposite in his post.

Idiots like this guy come out of their shithole subs where we are all banned and starts acting in a **completely** different way with a different attitude claiming : “I’m not one of those sheltered T_D’s , I am open to conversation and read both sides impartially **and still chose to support trump**. Then everyone is like : fuck i need to talk to this guy to get the truth, finally someone who makes sense but also supports trump who can help me make sense of this”. 


Makes him look like he’s not one of them really but it’s just an act...
$C: Nobody (would be a small fraction, poll r/askthedonald if you want) watches the fucking network news at the Donald. Tucker and hannity drop some zingers here and there but most of our talking points come from WikiLeaks or FOIA requests done by the likes of Judicial Watch. WikiLeaks has never been proven wrong about any of their info dumps. The truth is out there but it's sure as fuck not on your TV.
$C: That's really quite interesting. The only other German term I knew was schadenfreude. Thanks for elaborating. 
$C: god damn, dense af. can't be helped
$C: "I watch Fox News now." Clearly more than you! Haha! 
$C: I think they all suck in different ways. But just to steer away from the tit for tat, I mainly was pointing out that he makes it easier to pick apart because of the transparency (or perceived transparency) via his social media platform. I know it's part of the appeal for some. He could do himself favors by not getting into pissing matches on such a big stage. 
$C: Well said
$C: If one administration’s effects on the economy can’t carry over into the next administration then when the next downturn in the economy happens, which nearly all experts agree is coming, Trump will be solely to blame. 
$C: Glad those drone strikes have stopped and we are no longer dropping bombs in the ME.  
$C: Then you must really hate Trump! He’s had more drone strikes in his presidency than Obama.
$C: Wow way to detour the discussion. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Trump’s not a decent man. He cheated on three of his wives, decent people don’t do that. 
$C: that is because you are from the south
$C: Oh yeah? And Trump is a good guy? Tell me more about the guy who mocks the disabled, cheats on his wife, insults gold star parents, brags about sexual harassment. The guys a fucking douche.  Regardless of politics, Trump acts like a dirtbag, and Obama acts like a President. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: not a liberal

watch noam chomsky's manufacturing consent documentary and stop formulating your opinions from mass media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTBWfkE7BXU
$C: Lol. You speak like him. He has a good brain? He’s said a lot of things? 

Hahahaha
$C: I guess I don't get it, but whatever.

I've been repeating myself a lot in this thread because a lot of people are pushing the same (wrong) explanation.
$C: >Capitalism is a free market with no government intervention.  When there is government intervention, you no longer have true capitalism.

Nope, extreme Libertarian capitalism is not the only form of capitalism and other forms are not less "true"

Extensively regulated capitalism like a social democracy is still "true" capitalism, anarcho-capitalism is still "true" capitalism. I know you like the idea of a completely unrestrained free market but that doesn't mean such a form of capitalism is the only "true" form.
$C: It's still wrong of YouTube to shut down stuff like that. Just because they disagree with it. It's fucked up 
$C: [removed]
$C: Sure
$C: You should laugh more,
$C: > People hate this statement because they hate Sinclair not because the statement in and of itself is bad.

I hate the statement because I used to work in local news. A station/group owner that _FORCES_ it's stations to uniformly present a prepared, biased statement that injects itself into coverage while announcing a clear and specific bias is ALARMING and unacceptable.

I had colleagues at my station who ran the gamut from highly conservative to very vocally liberal - yet when it came to news coverage and reporting, all of that bias was shelved and the information gathered was what was reported. The conservatives put the screws to conservative politicians and officials, and the liberals gave the same treatment to their topics as well. 

Sinclair is declaring a bias and creating _literal_ propaganda with this statement, which essentially amounts to "don't trust anybody but us. Trust us alone." 

Sinclair is worthy of hate because they're the Clear Channel of TV. They're using their wealth and power to acquire and transform local media into a nationalised outlet with an stated intent that goes beyond "educate and inform" and into "influence and manipulate."  
$C: Such a high salt content is bad for blood pressure.
$C: The problem you have here is that you wanted to state a message about avoiding bias and the effects TV and infotainment has on the masses, but all you managed to grunt was not to look at screens to get your facts... While looking at a screen, and ignoring the fact that the same people who make the TV news write the print news also.
$C: U won't prove me wrong either.
$C: Quick question, are u truly as retarded as ur posting history suggests, or are u getting straight cash homie to spread the bs u spew?
$C: [deleted]
$C: yeah, now thats an opinion piece built off a bias based on sinclairs historical political leanings. the message has no conservative views. just branding
$C: goes off script .....'oh sorry we seem to have lost the connection'


$C: Hahaha, I only read your first few lines and was about to go off. Thanks for saving me time and energy, friend.
$C: [deleted]
$C: You aren’t clever enough to fool anyone 
$C: More like evolution vs creationism in this case. Just because there are two sides doesn't mean the truth is somewhere in between, that is dangerously irrational thinking.

Also you're a donald user lamenting about political tribalism.
$C: You are completely right, and I try to point this out when possible myself..

I'm so sick of being lumped into team A or team B, team red or team blue when we could and should be working alongside our brothers and sisters to make our lives better.. All public discourse in this day and age is SO inflammatory and tribal, seemingly designed to make regular people like you and I hate each other, it makes me sick..

I believe you and I aren't alone in this thought.
$C: I know, right? Propaganda at it's finest. It's being used to divide us, not unite us. Because if we're united then it's us against the "powers that be". And there are more of us than them.
$C: Do a little research, but it's not some huge secret. There are people pulling his strings from several different directions with several different agendas, but one set of the more well-funded string pullers are absolutely under the impression that the rapture is coming one way or another, so they can either help speed it along or sit back and wait for god knows how long for it to happen naturally... Some of these idiots fully believe that can help speed that process up and this is not some conspiracy there's plenty of right-wing interviews out there that have been done where they say exactly this if you just take a little time to look for it.

Recognizing Jerusalem was a very major first step of the prophecy in the Bible and there's absolutely no other reason for Trump to have come out and said that during the time he did other than that some of his "advisers" gave him bullshit reasons as to why he should do it and then praised him for how large his inauguration crowd was. Then he, of course, jumped at the opportunity to pay them back for such a fine complement of Truthiness... /s on that last part obviously, even though that's probably completely true and happens every single day in this administration.
$C: THERE IS A WAR ON CHRISTMAS
$C: >The problem is, 90% of what they report on isn't newsworthy.

I would not agree with that percentage whatsoever. 

> Anderson Coopers interview with Stormy Daniels is a great example, like freakin Jerry Springer. 

That isn't all they report on and you know it. I'm not saying they are packing some hard hitting shit every other day but they aren't nearly as bad as you are depicting.
$C: >The problem is, 90% of what they report on isn't newsworthy. 

Please tell us what is the definition of newsworthy and then show that we all agree upon it.  

>They create scandals out of thin air

Then someone can sue them...but...no one is suing CNN.   *But Fox News is currently being sued for creating a scandal out of thin air.*

>and don't actually report extensively on the things that could actually affect our day to day lives and our futures.


I recall numerous segments & documentaries on issues in Middle America on CNN.   There was an entire summer of programming during the Bush era, all centered around the plight & future of Main Street, USA.    Using the documentary "Walmart:  the High Cost of Low Prices" as a unifying idea,  CNN focused their attention on the state of Middle America ALL SUMMER LONG.  

 

They individual subjects were diverse & timely to working Americans, such as how the economy was changing, how dangerous consumer debt was, what jobs would pay best, how families coped with job loss...  

*They even covered how drug use was increasing in rural & small town America.* 

Fox News discovered that in... 2016....& only because it was useful as campaign propaganda.





 *Every reasonable issue I've heard from a trump supporter,  I've heard covered in the media.   long ago. . *I haven't heard them covered on Fox News, until it was too late.*   

 


*Journalism doesn't spell everything out for us simplistically,  promising that there is a solution.*

 There's plenty of media out there for you to be informed.


 
$C: People need to realize this, news is a money making media enterprise. The story that sells is the the story that airs, different networks have their niches, and because of this will not report on what may really matter. Especially when it conflicts with or criticizes any entities or people who may have a stake in said media companies, or anyone they may associate with. It’s the worst with the major TV network companies, but internet based news outlets aren’t immune either. CNN is entertainment first, as is Fox, MSNBC, etc...

Aaron Sorkin’s show the Newsroom is a pretty good, though overly dramatic and hokey, portrayal of how these companies run.
$C: It is definitely newsworthy that someone with access to our nation's secrets has so much blackmail fodder floating around them. They call this adverse information, and if he applied for a security clearance as an employee of a defense contractor, his application would be shitcanned immediately.

It is also newsworthy that the $130k probably broke the law on campaign contributions. 

It is also newsworthy that he paid a consultant $27k a day in taxpayer money to monitor the news for Stormy Daniels stories.

Should I keep going?
$C: >There is a difference between being biased, and biased reporting.  Biased reporting is dishonest, and untrustworthy. 

And I am telling you that while they are biased, not all of thier reporting and coverage is biased.

> News reporting should be unbiased, and free of opinion.

I agree. And it is sometimes.
$C: Again? [Where did that sink come from?](https://i.imgur.com/MDhbuT6.jpg)
$C: You could easily look that stupid thought up
$C: Just a natural tendency to believe that multiple voices are speaking
$C: >Who else has time and funds to collect a dozen random newscasts from all over the country and spend a week editing it into a 30 second hit piece?
 
It's not random newscasts, it's newscasts by local stations all owned by the same company and were likely all aired on the same day. It also does not take anything close to a week to edit together a 30 second video, especially one where they all say literally the exact same thing, word for word. No money and barely any time is needed to do this. 


$C: > Who else has time and funds to collect a dozen random newscasts from all over the country and spend a week editing it into a 30 second hit piece?
>

Actually, that sounds EXACTLY like a 20 something redditor. Funds = nothing, it's all on YouTube.


$C: I believe it's less about fake news (though that happens) and more about the fact that media is being condensed in such way that they are clearly in control of sending the same message across all channels.

If this is what they are doing now, imagine how they can slowly change the every day narrative of your personal reality.
$C: [removed]
$C: That’s not true and you know it. There’s are actual trained journalists at those news organizations, Fox isn’t now or has it ever had journalists or journalistic integrity; they were created to deliver propaganda because all the other news outlets at the time were telling the truth and those truths were inconvenient for conservatives. 
$C: Very subjective, because I think he's an old man with dementia who constantly sounds like a third grader giving a book report on a book he didn't read.  He has told so many objectively verifiable lies at this point that it baffles me how anyone could ever consider him remotely trustworthy.

But to each their own.
$C: I mean you could've just read anywhere in the thread instead of being proudly ignorant.

You should go to bed your parents will be hiding eggs for you in the morning.
$C: Yes, without the retarded comment, that would've been much nicer
$C: > ah so the msm came up with it to slander pro trump sites and now that it backfired we shouldn't use it anymore ?

“Fake news” is overwhelmingly associated with Trump’s repeated use of it to minimalize anything that might make him look bad. Do you think it’s cool to fly a swastika flag because it was originally a Hindu symbol or whatever?

You’ve already drank the kool aid if you’re that bothered by how the “msm” reports things. It’s the same as Trump crying foul for anything that makes him look bad... you’re so bothered by some subtle things you can’t even pinpoint, where are the lies? Are you not bothered by Trump shouting “birth certificate” for years when nobody doubted that Obama’s Mom was a white woman from Kansas (and therefore, it didn’t actually matter where he was born, just like it wouldn’t have mattered for Rafael “Ted” Cruz)? How are blatant lies only designed to rile up easily impressionable (and casually racist) people better than whatever bias you claim exists? 

Also I don’t know if you’re telling me to specifically diversify my news intake, but it already is, I listen to conservative radio almost daily and it has completely opened my eyes to how wrong many of them are in even the basic principles of their arguments. I like Michael Medved a lot, though I disagree with him on many things, but he’s about the only rational one out there. Prager and obviously Rush are pure propaganda, zero real discussion.

One last thing, you talk about the fake stories of Obama funding Isis, what about when Trump repeatedly said “Obama founded ISIS”? I heard him on Hugh Hewitt, and Hugh asked him something like “you don’t mean that literally do you” (he was trying to help him have plausible deniability of making that comment), and Trump just doubled down and said he meant it literally. It’s garbage, he’s blatantly preying on weak minded people for his own gain.
$C: it pushes many right wing narratives (FBI has a vendetta against trump, multiculturalism is bad, anti-muslim stories) that this video doesn't highlight. it is the furthest thing from neutral possible. they have "must run" stories meaning the stations have no choice to run whatever propaganda Sinclair wants.

>i'm tired of "news" telling me what to think

you're literally defending a propaganda organization who's goal is to tell you what to think
$C: That’s retarded. Reliable news sources do not tell you what to think. This isn’t news, this is propaganda. The goal of campaigns like the one in the video is to brainwash people. Fox has been doing it a national level for decades and now Sinclair is doing it at the local level too. 

People that actually think for themselves read newspapers. The NYT and Washington Post are as reliable as they come. Sinclair and Fox are trash and to believe for a second that anyone sincerely watching either is thinking for themselves is objectively wrong.  
$C: Well most of these retards like to be spoon fed.  Heaven forbid you think for yourself and form your own opinion using facts.
$C: Go google “objectively neutral”. In fact I’ll do it for you. First sentence that comes up:

>Objectivity is not neutrality. Neutrality means that a reporter has no position on the issue in question. It seeks to correct for the supposed and real prejudices and politics of authors. ... Objective reporters, if they do their job well, cannot remain neutral
$C: > Let's be clear: nowhere in that segment do the broadcasters disparage any specific media or news organization.

Not straight out no, but it's rather obvious what they are referring to. Sinclair expects their target audience (who they don't want to know that this is a message straight from them) to connect this with liberal media.
$C: >they dont lie

Is this where you hand-wave away every CNN lie and just say it was an accident?


[During live coverage of the 2016 elections, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo said that downloading the hacked and stolen Podesta emails from the Wikileaks website was a violation of law and that only the media could legally do so. The statement drew criticism to the network for being false.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/10/17/remember-its-illegal-to-possess-wikileaks-clinton-emails-but-its-different-for-the-media-says-cnns-chris-cuomo/?utm_term=.66ce52103107)

We can call Fox on being trash while also acknowledging that other news networks are flawed.  This isn't an us-vs-them kind of thing.
$C: It’s not “rightwinger slander”....both news sources are trash. 
$C: I'm not trying to have an argument.  Perhaps you are because of how you feel like you need to insult me while writing your response.

Fair enough though.  Surely you'll have no issue providing evidence that one conglomerate has a broadcasting area that covers 72 percent of homes with a television?

After all, you said this has been a thing for decades.
$C: You somehow managed to write out that whole paragraph while saying essentially nothing.

Broadcasting companies mandating that their stations must run politically biased segments has not been a thing before Sinclair.  If you have evidence that that's happened before, please provide it because I'm very interested.

That's a different issue than some vague, abstract platitudes about the news media being politically slanted or "warping reality" or whatever other edgy bullshit that you think you're woke for coming up with.
$C: >Cognitive dissonance

Yeah that's a pretty great, left wing atheist podcast. Everything after those words makes little to no sense but keep pushing! That turd has to come out some time. 
$C: You're*




I always love that argument, because it has no substance whatsoever, it's just a "I'm right so you are wrong and blind to my truth". I pity those that feel the need to call people sheep, it shows deep insecurity
$C: And project veritas hired a person to fake being an assault victim to discredit the actual victims of Roy Moore (I'm just guessing you're okay with this shit) but WAPO caught the plant, ON CAMERA, and you still wanna bitch about "fake news". I know digesting information is difficult but please… do yourself a favor before you go slinging that bullshit.

Honestly… you couldn't take a joke if it hit you like a truck so why bother. 
$C: I was just pointing out the apples/oranges of it all. You're talking about bias in news (or rather, what you see as overwhelming one-sidedness), whereas this is a script handed down by a parent organization. In my initial comment I was just pointing out the difference. Besides, I don't think the solution to news bias is scripts handed down from corporate owners.
$C: Yeah, you might've done what I did and assume based on the headline that this is a compilation of stations all running the same wire story (I've seen the exact same video you're referring to). This is a bit different though--[here's some context.](http://littlevillagemag.com/kgan-kxfa-sinclair-fake-news-promos/)

$C: Yeah those right wing globalists who control the media/hollywood/academia sure like pushing their agenda.

$C: What is the story on? 
$C: Yikes.  Take your meds.
$C: People talk like this?  If this is an honest reply, you might want to check your bearings.   Considering how defensive you just got based on a single comment that wasnt even over the top, I dont think much of reality would suite you.
$C: lol
$C: Very good point
$C: Let me make this clear. WE. DID. NOT. VOTE. THEM. IN. Donald Trump   lost the popular vote. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DO NOT GET A VOTE IN WHO TO DECLARE WAR ON. I or my neighbors did not drop bombs on Iraq, or invade Vietnam, or Panama, or anywhere else. 

And you have absolutely no right to judge us based on the actions of our government. Just like I have no right to judge a Russian citizen based off of Putin's actions. Or judge a Syrian based off of Assad's actions.

You're generalization of the American people is only causing more shit to be stirred up. You need to learn about how elections are conducted in this country before you accuse us of supporting these morons. 
$C: so tell me what makes the experience of someone with no education valuable? why should their opinion be valid? have they dedicated their lives to studying something other than how to hit cans on their fence with a bolt action? or is it just an opinion from a person that you know well? id take an educated persons opinion over your hillbilly family 100% of the time. and so would most people with any critical thinking skills.
$C: did i insult you at somepoint? i was talking about the video dumbass
$C: He says fake news is real and then goes on to be a Trump apologist. And I'm the one being ideological?
$C: I'm assuming you meant things like CNN and MSNBC, those are mainstream media Outlets, these are local Outlets. I bet you cannot find a single instance of that happening anywhere else other than this right-wing propaganda from Sinclair.
$C: No, they didn't. That is fake news.

One party supports coal, fracking, christian fundamentalism, and endless war. The other supports social programs, equal protection before the law, net neutrality and a whole other host of fantastic policies.

The parties are not equal and anyone telling you otherwise is shilling or mentally retarded.

$C: That’s a great video.
$C: They're being somewhat disingenuous. This video is specifically regarding the right leaning Sinclair Broadcast Group, which is trying to monopolize local broadcasting. None of the mainstream media they're ranting about have anything to do with this (not even Murdoch as far as we know).
$C: Are you one of those people who thinks that if a station is an ABC affiliate that automatically means that they're owned by ABC?

Oh, honey.
$C: Lmao Jesus Christ, perfect example of how ignorance and anger go hand in hand and feed each other. You’re unhinged. Comparing Dawn ads to the fucking news. As for the ignorance, Sinclair actually did force stations to air pro-Trump segments in addition to this statement. Stop being a soldier for your ideology and have some common decency 
$C: Lmao I said I didn’t want your manifesto and then you write three more. Seriously, get help. Having your political dogma challenged shouldn’t take you off the deep end like this, you sound like you’re about to blow up a hospital 
$C: They're not protesting.
$C: What? How do they reek of desperation? And name something you get info from that isn’t the news.
$C: Fine, but if we're going with fries too, I'll have to have you sign an NDA. If you break said agreement, the penalty is one double bacon cheeseburger from Whataburger for each infraction.
$C: They do own a few in major markets like New York, L.A. etc.  Same with NBC, ABC and CBS.  But most small market stations are owned by other media companies.
$C: Perhaps that's because "Hillary is a danger to our democracy" is not news, it's an opinion.
$C: Not sure if you're backing me up, or debating. But that was my entire point. It isn't any different. But sinclair is CURRENTLY in position to take a monopoly share of news networks. Like the final decision will be made in the next few months. If CNN gets to this same position in a few years, then I'm gonna be here making the same argument to pissed off liberals.

EDIT: in fact I'd link to this post to show how hypocritical it would be to support a liberal media monopoly, when so many were up in arms about a conservative one
$C: I do know that there is a difference between the right and the alt-right, but I have met a couple stable people who actually believe in Alex Jones and watch his stuff seriously. This just opens me to the possibility that this is really getting to people even if they won't admit it which is what I find scary. I appreciate conservatives who defy stereotypes though, and for that matter, liberals who defy stereotypes as well. The divide in this country is not as large as it seems I think. It has been blown out of proportion because the loudest voices are the most divided, and in order to fit into a political conversation, you kind of have to allign yourself with one of those voices. I have faith that we will soon see reasonable people who are willing to make compromises run for office. The U.S. clearly wasn't ready for anyone like that this election with someone like Ted Cruz, a traditional conservative, losing to Trump and Bernie Sanders gaining as much support as he did for being such a hard left socialist. I hope people see their own polarization and realize that there is no black and white answer, but rather a combonation of ideas that works best.

$C: To those outside of America it is hard to see the difference between Americans and their flags everywhere and singing the national anthem at events and schools and seeing North Korean propaganda, Chinese propaganda, so many examples of creepy nationalism really. 
$C: They're not the same. Ever since the words were first used people have made distinctions. It's really not hard to see how you can love what's unique about your country, without caring one bit about how much power your rulers have. That's a common mindset in a lot of European countries at least.

I am libertarian (between left and right), and some of my friends are alt right. Most of my family is alt left. That doesn't mean I shut them out of my life... (Although some of my left winged family doesn't talk to me because of that, but that's their choice)
$C: That's patriotism 
$C: Oh don't be so narrowminded - we're *always* changing our principles as we evolve on a societal scale, and we're not all the way up that scale yet, not by any means and the reason for that partly is because people actually believe what you've just said without a second thought as to just how young we are as empires and "civilised" people. We've had the last 100,000 years to reach where we are now, and it's only in the last 10,000 or so which we've had canonised moral ideals which have became the principles you believe are firmly cemented in time now. But they are not. Now on a cosmic scale, we are an extremely recent blip in history and the civilisations of tomorrow will look back on our time as the dark age of technology. 

Principles are forever shifting to accomodate the growing number of people we bear responsibility for in our ever-expanding population's and with the major decline in traditional religious belief's, our world for the first time is facing a wierd little phase of mistrust and lack of faith in one's own species. Not hard to see why let's be honest lol, but we were never better than we are now as a whole, and we're ever inching toward a greater platform - should our leaders decide not to annihilate us all on a global scale with nuclear fire, I could see us achieving rather a lot in the next few centuries.
$C: If that were true there wouldn't be any amendments to the constitution. 
$C: If I had that kind of wealth I'd do it as a joke because why not?
$C: In the articles of confederation the federal government didn't have the power to collect taxes.

The United States today taxes territories without representation.

The problem was excessive taxes, representation wasn't something people had a huge issue with until England started taxing the shit out of America to deal with debt.
$C: Are you talking about Shay's rebellion or the whiskey rebellion?

Shay's rebellion wasn't really a federal government thing. At the time there were not federal taxes, or a federal militia. The articles of confederation didn't really afford the federal government these powers. Shay's rebellion really concerned state taxes and state militias. Besides I don't think Governor Bowdoin is an exemplar of American values. He received very few votes in the subsequent election.

These articles lasted from 1781 to 1788. Only three years after the passage of the Constitution, Americans were already rebelling once again because of taxes.

I'm not sure "crushed" is applicable to the whiskey rebellion. The insurgents avoided conflict with the Washington lead militia. Only a handful of people were arrested, and all were aqcuitted or pardoned. Resistance efforts against the taxes continued for years. This made the tax so difficult to collect that the whisley tax was repealed under Jefferson.

We recognized as a country that we needed a federal government and that required funds. But we have bitterly opposed taxes since becoming a nation.
$C: They're not synonymous, but they do refer to different degrees of the same thing, more or less. Anything is fine in moderation, but when I'm talking about patriotism in america, I'm talking about those that take it too far, near the point of nationalism. Unhealthy obsession with patriotism is all too common in America, much of the older generation were raised with the rhetoric that America is the greatest country in the world and that our military should be worshiped.
$C: > because the concept of what is "noble" is an entirely subjective affair

$C: Not by amount of land mass, at least. Quality of land mass could be argued over.

$C: No shit Sherlock, but the argument was that Russia is bad because it has state run media. State run media can be good or bad depending on the state and the way that the media is organized

$C: They get paid more for lengthy comment wars like this one
$C: How many sheckles per PR comment?
$C: The content is not dictated, but the leader of the organization is, by politicians. The outcome is the same. There are no unbiased news, we need a literate and critical.public.
$C: Maybe the outcome in Poland is even worse, ever thought of that? What is needed is an education system that values and promotes critical thinking, that's the only way to combat this epidemic.
$C: >How about we don't nationalize it but we do **socialize** it?

People get irrationally angry and stop listening when they hear this word. 
$C: Capitalism?

My only question here, with no knowledge of how US TV works, are any of these stations the only station in their local area, or are more than one of these in the same area with no competitio, or are these individually owned stations, which are spread out and so only one of these would be seen in any given area?

If they're spread out and each serve a different area, I don't really see the issue if they want to give the same message. It would be no different to say 'local' radio stations in the UK, who are all basically owned by the same few companies, and who dub the name of the city you're in between the commercials.
$C: the US doesnt even have an excuse 

the US just sucks 
$C: They're using an older meaning where:

- The first world is America and its allies.

- The second world is the Soviet Union (now Russia) and its allies.

- The third world is everyone else.

That's why they say that: Poland used to belong to the Soviet Union. Regardless, though, their entry into the EU should place them solidly in the first world.
$C: That's not what first world means.

It is a second world country. 
$C: And you still think government is the best entity to regulate the industry most responsible for keeping the electorate informed? 
$C: Sinclair is not restricting anything, they're just putting more information out there than others. There's nothing Sinclair can do about anyone else wanting to write, film, illustrate or publish media in any other form. If they own something, they have the right to dictate its content. If Sinclair wants to purchase the rights to your content, you don't have to sell. If you don't like their programming, you don't have to watch it. All of their holdings, the stations they own, all of it is publicly available information. Its the responsibility of the viewer to be critical of any media they're consuming, nothing can take away that responsibility.

This entire thing is a sign that we still have a functioning press system in the western world. The acts of one organization are being ousted by others. When you have a restricted press, that becomes problematic over time.
$C: I respect your post, but the planned parenthood vs nra one doesn't mention that conservatives have a very different view of abortion than liberals. Pro-choice people are generally liberal, and believe that abortion isn't killing someone or something innocent. That's one reason why I feel that the line in the article that says "Who can forget all the hours the news networks dedicated to blaming Democrats for the loss of millions of innocent lives" is disingenuous. That line assumes that everyone sees a zygote as a living human but Dems/liberals are ok with murdering them. The second reason it's disingenuous is that [conservative] media is ALWAYS talking about planned parenthood. I don't even know if I'd know they exist and will provide abortions to those in need if the media wasn't constantly talking about them.


Anyway, the second part of that is that the inherent difference between PP and the NRA is that pro-choice people see PP as a public service that helps people in need with contraceptives (contributing to the good of society) and medical services, vs the NRA represents a product that is designed to harm. Personally, I think that the only positive things about guns in modern America is that 1. They're fun to play with. and 2. They can sometimes protect you from other people who have guns.


Last thing is that I see more liberals that are fine admitting that the Democratic Party or politician sucks than conservatives admitting that the Republican Party or an R politician sucks. 
$C: Represent Us is a non-profit that works to end political corruption - the fact that they use YT as a platform in the 21st century makes them more relevant, not less. 

America has a rigged political, economic, and social system. It's naive to assume otherwise simply because we have a Constitution.

Let me guess, you're a college libertarian?
$C: Sorry, but money will always be involved in politics.  I mean first of all, you are asking the same people who benefit from that money to create legislation that will take it away.  Secondly, there is no legislation that will effectively take it away.  As long as there is a government entity that has the power to benefit one group over the other, there will be back channels to filter money or favors in the direction of the power brokers.  I think the founders of this country had it right originally, there has to be a decentralization of power and checks and balances in place.  Unfortunately, many of those checks and balances have been eradicated over the last century and power has shifted dramatically into the hands of the politicians, bureaucrats, and deep state centered in Washington D.C.
$C: > getting money out of politics

Lol! Good luck with that..
$C: Running the best person for an area is one thing, but releasing oppo research to smear a member of *your own party* is another. 
$C: > Democrats, even moderate ones, support antitrust legislation.

Weird how they haven't done shit about it in the last decade then. AT&T was broken up by anti-trust laws and now they T-1000'd themselves back into an even bigger telecom company and not a single Democrat is proposing to do anything about it.

They're the ones who have better messaging, but when they're actually in power they also keep the status quo, like Republicans.
$C: > Democrats try to run the best person for the area in question

Buullllshit. My area is heavily Dem moderate and every election cycle they put up someone further and further to the left, so they lose every single election.

>Democrats, even moderate ones, support antitrust legislation

Democrats haven't cared about antitrust since Clinton was President. If they did Comcast, AT&T, and Google wouldn't be around.
$C: Must be tough to be this naive 
$C: Oh yeah, I'm the Republican who supports trust-busting, medicare for all, and BDS. Those classic pillars of Republican ideology. Idiot.

No, I'm saying that Democrats need to be held accountable by their base because running on "Republicans suck, aren't they crazy?" and eschewing big ideas in favor of incremental change and milquetoast compromise for 10 years leads to the kind of party-rot that had us miss the biggest political layup ever in 2016. Just look at Republicans: they're fucking terrified of their base, and they've achieved *all* of their policy goals for it. It's about time Democratic politicians feel a similar level of accountability.
$C: >And republicans have been in favor of antritrust law

Yeah, when it benefits them personally or politically. Nevermind that they (and Democrats) watched and did nothing (and some of them probably profitted) as cable and telecom providers have established regional monopolies or oligopolies and ruthlessly mistreat their consumers. Or how about Disney's slow march to engulfing the world of entertainment. Or the merger that created Anheuser-Busch InBev. 

>Trump's administration vetoed a merger of two huge tech companies just the other week

You mean the Qualcomm merger? It was between a Singaporean company and a Chinese company. Trump *hates* China, of course he's going to throw a wrench into the gears of one of their largest companies.

$C: I love ka-ra-tay.
$C: 36 now 
$C: You are misunderstanding I think, what the guy means is that the news dudes are talking about he supposed liberal fake news.
$C: Honestly, I think it's a bit naive to think the far left has their hands clean with this stuff. I mean, I'm guessing by your comment you watched the video and your reaction was that you saw a problem with alt-right media, where as I saw a problem with media overall, both sides. This is a huge glaring example but I think it's just that... one example. I'm more worried about the overall manipulation than alt left/right these days, imo it's a facade to make us hate each other instead of focusing on the real issues.
$C: Watching them realize it, comment about it on T_D, then get banned for commenting on it is a wonderous thing. 
$C: We get broadcast
$C: Hey, don't be racist.

$C: Well friend have I got a surprise for you from one heterosexual male to another.
$C: [A user's happiness is priceless, especially on a birthday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpq2Q7J2_2Y).
$C: Happy birthday! And your username u/parrot_in_hell definitely fits this story. You don't work for Sinclair do you? ;)
$C: Happy 12th!
$C: I'm sorry, what exactly about that did you want me to clarify?
$C: It should move to where the threshold is how much our children have to work to sustain homes and children of our own

We should not have to fork over over half the time we have on this beautiful planet. We should be free to do as we please. Especially when, believe it, **our** time together is woefully short. 

If we have to work for another man, *just so we can stay alive?* **Then we are not free**.

$C: Yea true unrest isn't happening unless people are actually starving. We can talk about organizing big Saturday marches on DC but until we are there every weekday for a month not much is happening 
$C: change happens when companies stop outperforming the previous quarter. if AI is really as impressive as predicted, the powerful will make changes so that they can remain powerful, and that may turn into something they can no longer control.
$C: You literally know nothing about the United States social programs history or any US history in general lol
$C: > You can still go door to door

Eh... not a great option, considering that's too daunting for most people and/or they simply don't have that kind of time.
$C: And those that run that aren't don't get anywhere. You need to have those traits, because those people have no qualms stabbing backs and lying to people's faces. 
$C: Local TV news is a primary source for stories of national interest as well as important local developments. It spreads through other broadcasts and through the internet.

You wouldn't notice 90% of it going away, but it's desperately needed when there's a big story like a school shooting or earthquake, or when corporate negligence destroys a town, or when local corruption is running rampant, or any other issue of importance. You don't want a central propaganda office covering up lead poisoning or chemical dumping across the US, or keeping their cameras far away from polling places while their political allies rig the vote.
$C: These parent companies will just buy new companies and restart the cycle
$C: The Telecommunications Act of 1996 that led to this problem was signed into law by Bill Clinton. Democrat politicians DO NOT care the way you have been told they do. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996
$C: The Democrats deregulated the media during the 90s to allow these massive mergers to take place leading to domination of the media by just a few corporations.

And even during Obama's eight years, he hardly commented on this if at all. Which has only increased the problem. Instead, he placed lobbyist-approved nominees onto the FCC without a fight.

Which Democrats have come forward with concrete plans to fix the domination of the media by just a few corporations, and what track record makes you think they'll actually fix the problem (and go against their previous two administrations)?
$C: I do vote, and I vote dem, but that doesn't mean that I seem them as all roses and sunshine. They're hacks. The lot of them. I'd love to see the CFPB get some of it's power back, but how much longterm good is that going to do? So we hold the line for 2 or even 4 years...maybe 10 if we're lucky. But then we lose the line and shit goes back down hill. This nation has done nothing but four steps back, two steps forward for the better part of 50 years now. Every time the line is lost, shit gets worse. I personally vote in every election I am able to, but we end up with the same shit every 8 to 10 years and it all goes south. Not to mention how much more efficient the GOP is at pushing through their stuff when they have a moment and the DFL isn't even willing to play ball on the same level. 

For real victory to happen there has to be a time where the people say enough is enough. But sadly it looks like the right is going to say that before the left grows a spine and does something about the status quo. The DFL keeps picking hills to die on rather than pushing up a hill, then shifting the attack to another hill. Keep the opposition off balance. Force them to change the rhetoric constantly.

Not saying voting doesn't matter, but without consistent participation of those affected, it may as well not exist. 
$C: Everybody in government, Republicans and Democrats both, all benefit from massive campaign donations from these massive conglomerates. Why would they end that? More importantly, why haven't they already? 

It's a win/win for both to work together. Legislation inflates the power of these businesses, and donations inflate the wallets of the politicians. More legislation is not the answer.
$C: "vote in november" guy is a shill? You sound like a shill.
$C: :/

Maybe someone else will see what I have to say then?


$C: If only there was a President who had overcome the intentional smears to get elected, eh?
$C: Ah, liberal projection. You checked who I'm subscribed to, good job! Seriously though, everyone else here realizes that the sinclair group aren't the only ones doing this. CNN and MSNBC reach millions daily, but because they are focused more on promoting liberal propaganda, I guess they're ok right?  

Disinformation he says, lmao, when's the last time you heard either of those news networks talk about a democrat scandal or Hillary's very apparent crimes, I'll wait.
$C: Very informative, thanks.
$C: Mate, I've got no idea. Ask everyone else from every generation though. They'd know.

$C: Hey guys, just a humble fox employee here to tell you all these news organizations are the same, fox doesn't produce hot garbage like the video above and badmouthing Fox is very dangerous to our democracy. 
$C: [Can confirm, as early as May 2017 KOMO-TV in Seattle \(owned by Sinclair\) has been required to air "must-run" news pieces which are slanted to the right.](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/sinclair-requires-tv-stations-including-komo-to-air-segments-that-tilt-to-the-right/)

[They have also been reciting the promo referred to in this video.](https://www.seattlepi.com/seattlenews/article/KOMO-fake-news-Sinclair-promos-12792032.php)
$C: And there's just as many ABC/CBS affiliates in the clip as there are Fox affiliates. 
$C: Plus "Fox News" is completely different than local news on a local Fox station.
$C: So I couldn't read what was in the circle either; but the headlines about Trump's talk on North Korea read differently.
$C: Its like... a conspiracy man! The same news publication with different stuff in the corner. Its crazy man!

Edit: FYI, Im making fun of this idiot... Here is the reason

https://www.wired.com/2013/09/the-secret-meanings-of-stars-in-newspapers/

>Rather, they refer to the edition printed over the course of the night.
$C: It's the date to show that they were released on the same day, and then the WSJ published them to different regions, giving readers a different impression based on where they live.  And this is some of the reason why Democrats and Republicans are so geographically based, they're getting lied to differently.
$C: This is like one of my Japanese animes O_O.

The uploader will have X amount of days (I wanna say 30?) to fight the takedown and if they are successful, the video will be put back online.
$C: Which is probably what people will do since this has gone viral in order to give the appearance of censorship. Sinclair is huge, but YouTube is too and it's a competitor.

$C: Hey, you don't have to tell me you've entered a dangerous new phase in media. My utter contempt for the direction and behaviour of the mainstream media has moved me and many others to support Trump.

You can tell a lot of conservatives are against exactly this stuff when it's currently the #1 post on /t_d/
$C: > Obama said in a speech, "You want freedom? You’re gonna have to kill some crackers! You gonna have to kill some of those babies."

It's hilarious to imagine him saying that. This infomercial sounds worth watching just for the laughs. But the PAC that made it should have been sued for libel.
$C: Ah, carry on.
$C: FUCKING CSPAN. THAT IS MY SOURCE.
$C: Yes, that's the first paragraph of the article.
$C: Name one instance. Come on, do it. I'll be waiting.
$C: Not real capitalism lol
$C: Presidents like Trump appoint chairmen like Ajit Pai, who in turn are more than happy to give large lobby-heavy companies huge legislative breaks.

Voting matters, in that sense.
$C: Democrats do try. Democrats pushed for the Dodd-Frank legislation after the 2008 recession, but as soon as the Republicans got into power they repealed it. The story of the last 30 years is about Republicans repealing any ameliorative measures that prevent monopolies. 
$C: thank you
$C: Not in those terms, no lol. But we do need more antimonopoly politicians. 
$C: You underestimate them, then. Democrats push for appropriate consumer-friendly legislation all the time, but Republicans have controlled the House for nearly 10 years so there's not much they can do. The Democrats created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. A Democrat-appointed FCC Chair, Tom Wheeler, is the one who enacted net neutrality rules in 2015. 

Just cause Republicans are in the pockets of the Mercers, Kochs, Sinclairs, doesn't mean all politicians are. 
$C: I'm sorry, how is that relevant to a discussion of ending monopolies? I don't care what side of the aisle they are on, I want all monopolies to be broken up. All of them - Google, Amazon, Comcast, AT&T, Nestle, Monsanto, etc. - all of them!!
$C: Except that's never what happens. Democrats strive to improve competition by enacting appropriate legislation so that small players have a chance. Conservatives prefer a wild west approach that allows this bullshit to happen. 
$C: What's an existing leftist megaphone? I listen to CNN and MSNBC and it's absolutely maddening how much they just parrot Whitehouse taking points. Every segment is either:

1. Interviewing a Whitehouse mouthpiece

2. Reporting some conservative propaganda verbatim (like the Nunes memo)

3. Interviewing a panel with one conservative and one liberal.

They rarely report on the Mueller investigation, and when they do it's always tied to "Russian interference". I've never heard them speculate and link it to investigating Trump.

Super interested in knowing where the liberal megaphones are.
$C: The dems have lots of money coming their way from these groups too... many of the companies themselves espouse left wing politics
$C: Their icons can literally be seen in this fucking video.

$C: Is he being paid by the scary ‘voting’ lobby, trying to spread democracy across the country? They *must* be stopped!
$C: >~~his~~ **her** comments

Also, yeah, it's not possible for people to have opinions unless they are paid to do so! Oh dear, I care deeply about this issue! How is that possible unless I'm paid?!
$C: Start making some points and provide sourced data to back up your points. 

You can’t just say “hurr durr dey da saym” without saying how or providing proof. Your vague and emotional talking points hold precisely zero water.
$C: You said this has been going on for years. That is verifiably false.

Since you know that now, having been corrected multiple times, continuing to push that narrative makes you a liar.
$C: Seriously, I mean he's even wrong about talk/sport radio not being dead. Podcasts killed talk radio a *long* time ago. I cant think of *anyone* on Fm or Am radio that I would want to listen to. I honestly dont even know if there *are* any talk radio stations where I live. 
$C: College stations generally have different types of music depending on who's DJ'ing. Sometimes indie rock, sometimes electronic music, sometimes folk, etc. It's normally less listened to genres. 
$C: Not quite the same. [Comcast](https://corporate.comcast.com) as an official company still exists, [Xfinity](https://www.xfinity.com) is a sub-brand within Comcast for their customer-facing services.

[iHeart Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHeartMedia) has completely replaced Clear Channel as a company. The people remain the same, but as far as official organization goes, Clear Channel is gone. Long live iHeart Media.

See how they don't put a spotlight on policy that helps the richest 1% of the country, like wall-street or the defense-contractors.

$C: By your comment history it seems like that it exactly what you want to give people, an education that reflects your values not critical thinking. People here don't want critical thinking, they people who follow beliefs, who follow their party, all while cloaking themselves in a self righteous veil of justice.
$C: I don't know that it's more effective.  It is out there, though.  As long as someone has an agenda, it's all propaganda 
$C: There's no need to truly join the conversation. Since this thread seems to think that only one party does this. They have no idea about the last administration's work with the Smith Mundt act.  They are also just supporting voting for the other team as a solution.  Why would I engage with such thinking.  Do you try to have arguments with uneducated 7 year olds,  or 90 year olds that are stuck in their ways? That would be a waste of time for everyone.  
$C: And March when the votes go unheard. Don't forget to follow up on seeing our votes through to the end.
$C: He's right. People need to wake up before change will happen. Vote with your dollar and with forceful retribution against infringement upon your rights
$C: As if the Democrats aren't owned by Soros, Google, Amazon and a lot of other big money and/or interest groups? 

Face it, both sides are corrupt with money.

That said, whoever fights for my 1st and 2nd amendment rights are the ones I'll be supporting. 

edit: Woooo boy! Seems I made some folks angry by suggesting there is corruption in both sides of the political spectrum. If you think your 'side' doesn't have big money pushing their narrative, than you are naive. If you think your side of any argument is so perfect and right that it's okay when your side uses big money influence, than you are arrogant. Either way, nothing positive can come from this petty pissing match so how about we put down our swords and pick up the peace pipe?
$C: and then Equifax just did whatever they wanted with impunity. Voting doesn't matter when it relies on having faith in people who are constantly scrambling for our approval.
$C: It's not just about voting. Vote blue, blue, blue. Vote these Republicans out. Every last one of them. They are poison. 
$C: Does your complete obliviousness to reality, creepy unwavering faith in oppressive institutions, and bootlicking make it easier for you to sleep at night?
$C: Um, what? It's not that bad yet. We can still make a difference by voting. Don't lose hope!
$C: Gun grabbers don't look at facts and base their opinion on that, they just see a problem and the first instinct they have is to call for a bigger government. There is no reasoning or logic behind any of it.
$C: Okay, so what's the solution then, all you gun owners do the same thing lol. I say what I think is a good move and you all just say "nope not gonna work." And that's it. So what's the solution then, let's just keep letting it happen?
$C: You dont find it odd that mass shootings have become more deadly since that Weapons Ban was overturned? 

 The United States government allows the purchase and keeping of arms until it conflicts with their goals, then they just do what they did to Fred Hampton. Also do you think that any gun you can purchase is gonna be effective against a drone 30,000 ft in the air?
$C: My point is, most people who defend the 2nd amendment use that excuse "it's so we can defend ourself from tyranny". I call bs on that, just be honest about it, it makes you feel safe and powerful. Nothing wrong with wanting to feel that way, but it's complete bs that any of you is willing to fight tyranny. If handing taxes to the top 1% while they already own the majority of the world's wealth while millions die isn't tyranny, man I don't fuckin know what is.
$C: Bullshit. Open your eyes, if you don't already see that happening, it's because you don't want to.
$C: Are you trying to make this easier?
$C: T_D power users are russia propaganda workers whether they believe it or not.
$C: I guess virtually every legal scholar until the 1950s was naive too.  It was to prevent tyranny, but not because they wanted an armed populace to be able to overthrow the government.  It was because they didn't want a federal standing army, which – gives what? – we have right now.
$C: Exactly. You don't know anything about politics then. Seriously, I don't mean that as an insult, just that you don't understand how it works. Politics had a huge effect on your everyday, in some ways directly and in other ways indirectly, but it most definitely does. You're the people republicans love the most, those willing to ignore all that's wrong because you rather just focus on your own inner circle and not rock the boat. Hey that's fine, we're never gonna have 100% participation in democracy, but you're definitely incorrect in saying it has no effect on that part of your life.

Also people aren't just bitching, they are protesting, voting, rebelling, etc, maybe just the people you know are bitching and complaining only.
$C: Justice Scallia, the author of the majority decision for Heller, disagrees with you.
$C: > We just had several weeks of popular sentiment for ~~sacrificing~~ limiting our rights back to the way they were a few decades ago.

FTFY
$C: Can form? Dude open your fuckin eyes lmao. It's been formed. That's my point, you pro 2nd amendment people are in denial cuz none of you actually believes in using it for a tyrannical govt or none of you have the balls. Either way that argument is bs.
$C: There what is? Do you know what the word enabler means? If you give a druggie a needle, you're enabling. If you refuse to limit the ability to get guns you're enabling children murderers, it's that simple.
$C: Ok, well I'm not sure what the adjective for Huxley's views would be, but they're closer to Huxleyian - if you want to get specific. 
$C: You disagree with him. So Trump. 

This is how Reddit works. Trump is the primary antagonist of literally every thread, no matter how unrelated a reasonable person would find it. You’re going against the circlejerk. Therefore, Trump. 

Branding you as such means I can dismiss your opinion while still maintaining a guise of intellectual superiority, despite not actually being smart enough to provide a rebuttal.

$C: Old people vote, and old people watch those stations.
$C: Didn't they social engineer the creation of the Tea Party?
$C: Koch brothers one of the biggest examples of willfull ignorance and projection by Trump supporters. They blame Soros for funding every political stance Democrats take and every protest Democrats take part in.

Yet in reality its really the Koch Brothers bribing Republican politicians, in the form of large donations, to push every agenda they have. 
$C: Somehow I feel like the Tea Party kind of got away from them.  Sure they are dismantling the federal government, but I'm sure they didn't foresee the alt-right coming up and Trump alienating most of America.
$C: Well lobbyists are technically the ones doing the asking.
$C: Some people are pro-deregulation because it is bound up in the political space with issues that they care about. For example, somebody who wants to limit the legality of abortion might be "in favor of" corporate deregulation because it's hard to vote for the former without voting for the latter. 

The way humans work when confronted with a system where you sort of have to support a bunch of issues even if you mostly care about one thing is that they tend to bend toward supporting those other things. For example, imagine that I really hate gay people and want their lives to be worse. This is an important priority to me. To get that, it helps if I am willing to vote for inaction on climate change. From here, I'm left with two options: I can choose to believe experts on climate change, but vote for inaction anyway, which makes me feel bad about myself; or, I can choose to believe that climate science is a hoax. The latter makes me feel better about myself, so that's the one I do. You get something similar with deregulation, where a lot of people who wouldn't reap much in the way of direct benefits from it fight for it, because the alternative is understanding that they voted for something harmful.
$C: And voting rights
$C: The safety portion, not the business side.  Look up airline deregulation.  
$C: It shouldn't be, but that's what you get for being born in the blossoming years of the information age.
$C: That's not an argument. You actually think regulation aka government intervention would make the news less biased. More government always decreases competition to the point where the only ones that survive it are the big corporations with the most money.
$C: Calling it the free press when they are told what to say by an overloading figure is an oxymoron. It needs to be reigned in and regulated immediately.
$C: I think I'm going to puke.
$C: To be honest Mr. Not_so_magic_8_ball, I just keep shaking you until I get the answer I want. 
$C: Maybe I'm being a pessimist, but I don't think it's going to be easy to teach people to do their own research. Now, more than ever, there are people who are offended by the mere thought that their ideas are incorrect, whatever they are. To research it would be to imply it's wrong.
$C: It does not take much and yet close to nobody does it?

$C: Identity politics. When people put their ego ahead of truth and rationalism

It doesn’t take a lot of common sense to know that offensive speech is just as important when it comes to the first amendment. So is the right to call out some people that are being offensive jackasses. 
$C: sure; i bet you're going to tell me X-Files is still on the air too! ^^^(/s)
$C: RIP Wade Boggs. 
$C: Fake news!
$C: No you're thinking about Wade Boggs, he is very much alive.
$C: But why male models?
$C: nope he ded thats a robut
$C: Fake news that's an impersonator from the deep state
$C: Yes, hence the part where I state “the movie was beyond bad”. Its a horrible horrible movie trying to cash in on the awesomeness of the first movie and you can tell. The “jokes” are forced and maybe only fun if you’re like 13-15 years old.
$C: Also, the stupider politics gets, the stupider mainstream media reporting of politics gets. Even well-respected brands like the New York Times report republican trolling as if it were honest politics, and they often refuse to provide necessary context when reporting obvious lies by known liars in the News section of the paper. Sure, you can find context and proper analysis for news stories from some of their opinion writers (like Paul Krugman), but they have also recently hired right wing trolls like Bret Stephens and Bari Weiss as opinion writers to "balance their political coverage". While they claim that they're trying to balance left-wing and right-wing views in the opinion section, all they've managed to do is balance thoughtful, reality-based views with simplistic, reality-denying views like "climate change isn't actually real" and "left-wing college students are fascists".
$C: Ahh got ya got ya. I think what you're saying here is a much better attitude to have than people just saying "well all news is bias" or "people can just look up their own news now". If we can expect a certain standard in our news and start to reject bias and agenda more and more we can make the changes happen and getting better news...eventually haha. 
$C: They're pretty stingy with their endorsements, except on one occasion where they randomly gave it to Doug Jones. I can tell you for sure everyone endorsed by Our Revolution and the Democratic Socialists of America are legit. Hit up /r/SandersForPresident too though Political Revolution is the more active Sanders subreddit.
$C: its a fair question, but at this scale i dont think the past is a good indicator of the present or future. We live in a *vastly* faster evolving society than any previous generation has ever *conceived possible*. The scale of empires has changed.
$C: If you're on Android, you can use an app called NewPipe. It's a YouTube app replacement that has a built-in download button. I try to stay away from most of Google's apps and NewPipe is a good replacement for the YT app.
$C: I see people like you complain about those news agencies and all I see is someone trying to work the refs.

Post history confirms. Your problem is that they report the news.
$C: > theres a difference between everyone reporting the same story, and having everyone under your umbrella rehearsing propaganda lines, you'd do well to learn the difference.

rinse and repeat until you can distinguish. 
$C: I could see the problems people have with wapo and nytimes, but disliking Npr is basically disliking the cure for ignorance 
$C: Wapo and New York Times, sure, but NPR is one of the least partisan, least corrupt, most factual sources of news in the country.

$C: If you think I'm reading any of that you piece of trash then you're more delusional than I thought.

One look at your post history shows how much of an ignorant shill you are
$C: Oh the Washington post?? Owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos who got his money from government subsidies. The man who hired 100 ex intelligence officials at the Washington post? Surely he's not like anyone at Sinclair.
$C: I feel a copypasta coming on
$C: All I know is my gut says maybe 
$C: Doesn't change the fact that you've got the admins working to push the Conde Nasty agenda, and people like /u/dredge_the_lake trying to insult people for pointing out that mods like those in r/videos are highly biased and pushing an agenda. 
$C: STILL LOOKING!!
$C: Yeah, the gender politics crowd are particularly notorious for this. Science is the best thing every but only when it agrees with the desired worldview.
$C: I can't wait to be waterboarded
$C: I’m sure they thought you that. 
$C: Honestly I never looked into that and it was just a big meme to me. Could you show me what he was actually right about though cause if the frogs are you bing gay then I would like to know lol
$C: Right, all those communists holding rallies with torches and...uh..

what are the communists doing atm again?
$C: And if I check your history will I find /r/politics or some other pro-DNC sub?
$C: The term fake news has made it so that people stay entrenched in their views and disregard everything they disagree with as fake. 

It's truly horrifying to witness this era of politics. Not because the politicians are necessarily scummier, but because the ignorance of the general public is on full display.
$C: It’s very much something that happens on both sides (doesn’t make it right)
$C: So isn't that like all news media?

WaPo has had the "democracy dies in darkness" slogan on their home page since Trump was elected.  
$C: Yeah okay 😂 how naive can you be
$C: [deleted]
$C: It’s a dog whistle for Jews, they are blaming this on the Jews. 
$C: Really?  They specifically state the "fake news" is online.  
$C: He has no point. Just a partisan opinion being paraded as some type of heroic effort to anecdotally point out that all search results from Google ARE ACTUALLY LIBERAL CUCKS HERE TO TAKE YER GUNS. 
$C: That’s very surprising, as I did it twice before posting.

Perhaps they point you to the sites you visit the most anyway.

I am rarely pointed to a conservative site when using Google news search.


My original searches was actually “multimillionaires multiple Mansions, trump tax”


I like to see what others get.

$C: Yep, half the people in this thread will use it as a sign that someone other than their own media, Sinclair and Fox news, are propgandizing.

This is Neo nazi propaganda media. The fragile whites who want to privatize everything have one last chances because Trump is such a collasal fuck up.
$C: [deleted]
$C: > I'm not on any "side".

said the leftist
$C: I said both sides are “doing the same thing” (engaging in propaganda), not both sides are “the same”.  Youre right that the shitty things the right side is doing are different shitty things from the shitty things the left side is doing.  Its a horse of a different color.  (You’ve got left-leaning and right-leaning channels reading from the same scripts in the below video.)  If you climb high enough the source on both sides is corporate greed who will fund whatever side stands to make them more money at the time.

$C: What?
$C: That's ok if you refuse to believe any of it. Have a good day :)
$C: Then state the exact quote, verbatim of Trump explicitly calling neo-nazis good people.  State it and I will retract my judgement - until then it stands.
$C: No they do everyone do and we comfy and decide not to do anything and its sad.

$C: tfw the left owns the majority of msm yet idiots refuse to believe it. just goes to show how the left ruined public education lol 
$C: The Democratic Party is heavily in bed with the automotive, military, and a massive chunk of the energy sector as well as entertainment, IT, and I would heavily argue medical. 

Hence OBamacare, hence automotive bailouts, hence 0 regulation on social media, hence huge contracts supporting fracking and solar. 

The MSM along with Fox are both very in support of Economics of the center right. 
$C: Which of them have been for Russian collusion?

NONE of them. They've all been for crimes people committed ages ago. IIRC, 10 years ago in one case.

Can you still only post "approved" sources (no right wing sources we're allowed at one point) there or did they finally do away with that?
$C: what?
$C: Maybe on the overall political spectrum it could be considered potentially moderate but in the sphere of American politics it is very much left wing/pro liberal. 
$C: Supporting Hillary Clinton is right wing? Explain that. I will give you my address and name, if you can rationalize that and I'll send you a grand USD. I swear on my nana. Do it up.

$C: Who do you think writes those cards at most small tv stations?
$C: Gotcha, reading your comment on its own, it seems like you're just criticising anchors. I agree with you, but your comment is confusing.
$C: When did I ever say the regulations cause Monopoly? I said they promote corporatism.
$C: A free market is a market that is free of government restriction. People make corporatism and free markets a false equivalency. I look at corporatism more as a form of fascism/oligarchy. A free market system would have led to some painful times in the late 2000s, especially in the financial, auto and homebuilding sectors. The economy would have eventually recovered naturally, but in a governmental system where politicians' re-election success is directly tied to economic performance, it is definitely in politicians' and business leaders' best interest to keep each other viable. A Michigan politician who has GM go bankrupt can't just go to auto workers and say that the auto industry is dead here, and things won't recover for a long time. I, personally, wouldn't mind businesses failing if they deserve to fail. Others prefer government interference to remove boom and bust cycles that come with a market-driven economy, but I don't think that is fair to the fiscally responsible ones.

I've never been one to say one person's economic philosophy is right or wrong, because it is all relative to what kind of society people would prefer living in. I would never say socialism is wrong, but I would prefer a different economic system.
$C: It would be harder for said profit-making entity to do that without all those government resources, though. I live in a city where I can only get Charter for internet, and it sucks. No reason that should be the case, but it's how municipalities work.
$C: I mean, it was when it came out first :P
$C: Because he's bought out. Sure you might be getting part of a "real" story but the show is set up so subtly in a way that influences your initial thoughts about subjects to the point in which the big media can manipulate how you think over time and repetition. Its so subtle and he might be very likable to some, but I see straight though it that they want me to think certain ways about things, and I think that it's terrible and unfortunate that so many people unknowingly subject themselves to it.

Edit: I don't plan on changing your mind, I just want to show you my point of view and maybe that could spur some thoughts of your own on this and how it might all be a facade. Hope all is well.
$C: This has nothing to do with trump. Only the corrupt media
$C: Bro im getting down voted too. It doesn't bother me as long as we can have a civil conversation. I don't watch him because he's just the same as Stephen colbert or John daily or or Maher or any of those guys, I'm sure you know the archetype I'm going for. Left wing talk show late night people.

I truly believe they're bought out by big media and are using subtle propaganda to influence those who do not have a strong grasp on politics (I. E. Majority of people who watch these shows - just a guess). Most all media is bought out and I personally do not trust 95% of all media given to us nowadays. I'd love to watch your segment you bring up would you happen to have a link?

Edit: I didn't down vote you. Don't be so quick to assume bro. I'm not out to get anyone or troll.

$C: Work for a local CBS affiliate NOT owned by Sinclair.  So nice to see someone in this whole thread who actually knows what the fuck they're talking about.
$C: Agreed.  


$C: Care to give even just a few examples please? 

Bc the harshest critics of his actual policies, to me, were from fellow liberals. His record on drone bombings, for example, is horrendous and unforgivable imho. 

I just never thought the media, other than clearly leaning left operations, really fawned over him. 
$C: [removed]
$C: > It's also pretty easy to be a great president when you save the economy



Considering that Obama spent his entire presidency blaming Bush, I don't think the economy was ever saved 




>stop a healthcare nightmare from occurring, 




You mean like the nightmare that's occurring right now as more and more people notice the sharp rising costs of their premiums as the ACA takes effect? 



>keep the country safe, 


Right, because North Korea just got their bomb last January, right after the inauguration, and ISIS really was just a B team after all, and the 80's called and asked for their foreign policy back so Russia was never actually a problem until they rigged the election for Trump 



>and do it all with the utmost professionalism and respect. 



Yea so by now it's just abundantly clear you aren't referring to Obama




>But that being said, I doubt you'll find anyone here who will actually say Obama was "perfect." The Dems don't have a /r/the_donald. 




I mean, why would they? They have CNN, MSNBC, Huffington Post, Vox, Comedy Central, HBO........



>Criticism of our leaders is allowed and fosters debate.


Such thrilling debates, consisting of such stunning points as "YOU'RE A RACIST!" and "YOU'RE A NAZI!"



Gtfo with this nonsense. 🖕🏾🖕🏾
$C: The left had plenty of problems with Obama, and the farther left, the more problems they had with him.  I mean, you even named a couple of them.
$C: I mean it's pretty easy to look back wistfully at Obama with some rose-colored glasses blocking the view to his many flaws when we're dealing with what we have right now.
$C: Is this a serious statement given what we’ve found out about Facebook, Cambridge Analytica, and Russian bots?
$C: >  in the face of evidence of countless news stations reading from the same script, people still consider things like a White House administration 'controlling' the news to be unfathomable.

No sequitur

This demonstration of countless news stations reading from the same script doesn’t originate from the White House, it originates from Sinclair broadcasting.

However, the Trump administration did pave the way for Sinclair to control the media like this....

.... but I dare anybody to prove Obama did something similar
$C: For fuck’s sake that’s what one side wants you to believe so that most people will just throw up their hands and stop paying attention to fucking facts.  Both sides are not the same.

For example, it was one side that pushed for more regulation against the owning of too many media outlets, the subject of this fucking thread.  The other side has rolled those regulations back.
$C: You would think that anyone with a stake in the military industrial complex would support trump as he is dumping tons of money into it. Obama regularly mocked Fox News and he was 100% correct when he would do so, holding trump to a higher standard for essentially a crude version of what obama was doing doesn’t seem intellectually honest. 
$C: They do the same thing that Tucker Carlson does, bring on the most absurd person they can find with opposing viewpoints and paint them as a representation of every person on the opposition. Anderson cooper is just awful now and he isn’t even the worst one. You can watch things that support your viewpoint and you can pretend that that is a accurate assessment of the proper  worldview but much like a lot of others on both sides of the aisle you are missing the bigger picture. 
$C: oh do you now? do you find it fair? I bet that's how you rationalize sitting and watching it all fucking day.

Go outside. The news isn't real, like at all.
$C: Every network (Fox included) has truth in their reporting. I’m talking about bias, it’s interesting to watch people deny the existence of bias or the propagation of an agenda because that agenda fits into their world view. People who watch Fox do it, people who watch the other nonsense do it. 
$C: I think crediting Trump with that is ridiculous. 

Surveys of trust in media has shown for years that, en masse, people don't trust the media (save for their preferred station/channel/paper). 
$C: I couldn’t agree more, I wasn’t thrilled when he was elected as he is cartoonish in his behavior and overconfident but this was a spot on call by him. It’s been hard to even watch any of that crap anymore because it’s all so over the top with cheerleading or doom and gloom depending on who is in charge. I used to go to cnn for my global news and I loved wolf blitzer for the longest time, it was really sad to watch him became a partisan hack.
$C: In a broader context 
$C: I'm loving my sandwich right now.
$C: “Everyone who disagrees with me is a paid agent reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.”

Deal with it or gtfo, before we make you.
$C: At least I’m not licking anyone’s boots, degenerate.
$C: Yep that was it. 
$C: > Why would I be mad about a low effort commissioned hit piece from the left that only makes them seem even more retarded than usual?

Yep, still mad
$C: I don't think that's necessarily the case. I understand that I have biases based on where I am from, my education, my experiences. Everyone does. In fact knowing that these biases exist is probably the only way to mitigate them.
$C: Done all and your profile

$C: You're right, it's just boring conservative propaganda that props up a racist, bigoted party that has a soft heart for Nazis.

$C: And you and your tribe will be.

$C: >My point is that they aren't Infowars.

youre moving goal posts again
just because they arent breibart and a constant stream of lies doesnt invalidate they dont belong among the respectable press and knowingly broadcast fake news regularly
$C: Except it is, so it really doesn't matter what it "sounds like" to you.

I know, it sucks that facts have a well known liberal bias.
$C: Lol just spectating but facts have a liberal bias? What about any gun control discussion where the cities with the highest murder rates all have the strictest gun laws. Doesn't that make it seem like the liberal argument is completely full of shit? Or do you somehow just brush that off


$C: [deleted]
$C: It was the first major network to report on the existence of the Trump/Russia dossier. 


That's where most of the "CNN = fake news" stuff came from: it was from the fallout of this article, and how unimpressed Trump was about it.
$C: I agree. Everyone has bias despite what they may claim. 
$C: Barack is a Muslim he admitted it himself and all his family are Muslim. Keep living in your dream world where Obama was so amazing. He's the one that started the identity politics race baiting marxism.
$C: Yeah everyone has seem to forget about that CNN producer caught on camera saying the Russia narrative they were pushing was, as he put it, “complete bullshit”....because ya know, it’s all Fox News pushing propaganda. 
$C: I think money influences politics far too much, but I believe one side of the aisle has been much worse about it than the other the past 10-15 years...
$C: It's not the satire, it's that the arguments are shoddy. 
$C: I did and its not. Maybe a 3rd tops literally by Hitlers definition. Seriously dude, can people get along. The thing about the idea of the 1% is that its simply bad for everyone for that much wealth to exist and not be in circulation. We as a country just print more money with the expectation that people accept it. Realistically its worthless if other countries stop using it. Tax coroprations and billion/multi millionairs more on the basis that this country and its laws was essential to them making money. Crap back in the day you had to pay someone to prorect your goods. Now you have the police, navy, airforce, etc to do the protecting. Building projects only hurt if you use the lowest bidder, and give them an effective tax rate of 0%. Im sure there are quality companies that we could choose instead of the lowest bidder.
$C: Ok that extension is awesome! Your a legend.


And yeah , first time giving gold and I pick a racists douchebag *feelsbadman*
$C: Read his comment history. He doesn’t.

He is for banning people who don’t worship Trump and who go seek T_Ds side of the story. We are all just snowflake trolls. 

>	and its in the name of T_D that its a sub for Trump Supporters. We have a sub for people to question are beliefs politely. Theres no reason for a Bernie supporter to be on T_D other than trolling. The fact that y’all can’t deal with the fact that there are subs with opposing opinions than you guys is sad and adds to the term “snowflake” that y’all are often given


Note how he says “question *our* beliefs politely”.

T_D don’t want to have to debate 1 on 1 in the comments. They brigade each post basically... he says he forms his own opinions yet throws himself in there with everyone’s opinion being his.

$C: Not sure what you're implying, but have an upvote,  friend. 
$C: Where did I begin you idiot? Read...learn to read.
$C: I agree. He brings on unwanted criticism. I won’t argue that. 

My issue is how the media deals with it. When you have a cnn anchor going on air, and says “I reached out to Twitter to see if he violated the terms and services” that’s when I’m like wow really. It’s just too emotional. You would’ve swore trump slapped everyone in the face after he tweeted. 

It’s not that serious. Let’s calm down now. 
$C: Sounds good.  Heard the same thing before.  It was Bush's fault not his.
$C: Where did you hear that?
$C: No it's right on par with my response to the guy giving Obama angel wings.  He's no saint either.
$C: He also destroyed Libya, Syria, Ukraine and Yemen, too.

Obama is a piece of shit, just like Trump.
$C: And hides the direct quotes from Obama as well as they can. Yes it is
$C: How many of those are alleged? Obama allegedly has 4 homosexual lovers that has come forth.... Same scrutiny? He also showed his erect cock to an airplane full of journalists and there wad crickets. You think Trump would be treated the same?

The difference between the two are the way media try to portray them. To this day they have the nerve to suggest Obama was a scandal free president. Lol. Fuck them all. Hypocrites. I guess you forgot how badly they treated Bush back in the day
$C: What makes you say that? Do people in the north prefer politicians to screw you as long as they sound intelligent and same nice things, rather than politicians who speak like jerks but are not responsible for nearly as much suffering?

It's like people on reddit would rather get fucked with a rusty knife by a friendly and personable guy, than only get yelled at and called names by a guy who is not charismatic. 
$C: > Oh yeah? And Trump is a good guy?

No
$C: Wait what? The other stations covered what fox said? Umm ok. You missed the point. Obama was getting critiqued by one station, Fox. Every other liberal, biased station didn’t. He could get away with anything. If you can’t see the difference, then I can’t help you. 
$C: I think you may have missed the obvious sarcasm.
$C: The video was about people saying the same thing, you're repeating yourself a lot, I'm copying exactly what you're saying with an added "This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.", and you don't get it? ;D

(again, not trying to make a point here)

Also thank you for doing that, I'm always tempted to do similar things when I see misinformation, but I'm too lazy
$C: You assume too much, and twisting terms into catch-alls because you feel you have a monster to slay doesn't actually help you.  Yes, there are capitalistic characteristics in a mercantile economy; however, all capitalism means is free competition, free entry into the marketplace, and private ownership of profits.  When you use a taxpayer-funded agency to REMOVE competition, that's certainly not capitalism, and that's what we have with the FCC.  
$C: I’m a nazi because I disagreed with you? YouTube is owned by Google and if you use their platform and they don’t like what you have to say they can shut you down. Having a YouTube channel is not the same thing as owning a news organization. 
$C: “I don’t have a rebuttal so I’m going to tap out” 

Classic. 
$C: Its not being salty really. It is just a sad realisation at what a bunch of idiots I share with this world; I know that anyway, but keep reminding myself every time I look at Reddit comments - my bad.
$C: Ok ok ok, I can’t help myself. What’s in YOUR post history...

$C: We really aren't. The majority of people in this country are rational and think for themselves. I don't assume that when I watch/read the news that what I'm hearing and seeing should be taken as the absolute truth and use it to validate myself or my beliefs. I use it as a tool to build my own opinions, to challenge what I already know and think. And if what I took in has a chance of changing my point of view, I research it intensely before committing to it. 
$C: I know he has puppet masters, every good politician does, just not that their trying to bring about the rapture. Which group in particular are you referring to? His allegiance is to Wall Street and corporatism, not to any religious ideology or its cronies. My uncle is convinced 70% of the country are practicing Luciferians and that Obama was having seances, child orgies in the White House, and was also trying to bring about Armageddon so Satan could come back and rule us all. He’d also tell me to ‘“just do your research, it’s out there!”

I’m of the philosophy that everyone in power is really like a chicken with its head cut off and they all have their own conflicting and self serving agendas, that everything is really a clusterfuck and not as nefarious and well organized as many believe. There’s just not enough people in high power who I’d believe are of such a hardline Christianity that they think they’re bringing about some biblical prophecy. Of course there’s a grain of truth in most conspiracies, but the truth is always less sensationalized.
$C: Ummm, okay? 
$C: Did you actually watch the interview and hear the questions she was asked? Pure smut. This was a consensual sexual encounter between two adults, way before he was president. It's not news, it's smut. The MSM, especially CNN, gave free promotion to a porn star for weeks. 
$C: I feel like nowadays the vast amount of airtime on MSM outlets, as well as web articles, is opinion pieces. They take one piece of information and speculate spectacularly to what it means, while at the same time, framing it in a way that makes it feel as it it already happened. And most are extremely biased, meant to pander to the most emotional and reactionary of us. 
$C: I mean, why would one person say so many things on a subject.

Lol the irony.
$C: The people who are against this are not against bias in the media. They are against conservative viewpoints being aired. 
$C: In this case, yes.  Sinclair owns these stations and Sinclair is the company forcing them to read this script.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/business/media/sinclair-broadcast-komo-conservative-media.html
$C: All of these stations are actually owned by a conservative broadcasting group. This is likely one of their famous must run segments. If you think only liberals try to control the narrative you're incredibly delusional.
$C: academia is left wing because educated people with critical thinking skills are never right wingers unless they are immoral  
$C: The one piece of data I see missing is a clear definition of what "Negative" is. For instance I have a read a few Fox news reports that "Criticize" Trump by basically saying that Democrats are out to get America and that Republicans are letting them ruin the country so Trump needs to wrangle in those Reublicans. Is that a negative Trump story?

I am also confused by the very small sampling numbers. If it's based on the first 100 days did they just do small samples because Fox news and CNN are a lot of local channels, blogs, and general internet news sources so those numbers seem pretty small.

I Def niteoy agree that CNN and the like try their very best to just crap on Trump whenever possible but I really don't see it as that skewed. Though I guess that Fox could just be the very vocal minority.
$C: This segment in particular?  It's railing on how the majority of media presents a biased outlook and they are the only ones who are objective.  

You are correct in the video's content, but not correct in its political lean.  Look up Sinclair Broadcasting if you care to learn.

All done. 

Downvote away. That’s all you can do. 
$C: Media Matters?
$C: Well, that's a pretty weird reply. Notice how you worded these...     
One is "coal, fracking, christian fundamentalism, and endless war"              
The other is "supports social programs, equal protection before the law, net neutrality and a whole other host of fantastic policies"           
               
OK lol, this is just silly. Just look at what you wrote, good words for people you like bad for another! come on, do better, you do realise Nazi folk called themselves The National Socialist German Workers' Party. Sounds Ok doesn't it? yeah, means nothing.          
Actions speak louder than words, and I do believe you are picking on me because I post on T_D? like that means anything to an argument at all.           
Pathetic.
$C: Nice debating skills.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Lol seriously? And you are on a thread about propoganda? Listen to yourself, it's like you are reddit Gestapo, checking post history like a nosy old nazi hag.

Here's how you sound: liberals want illegal immigrants here who can terrorize America and suck the tax payers tits while conservatives want to  Make America Great Again and keep our borders safe!

Yes, I have posted in t_D, I just saved you the time it takes to check. Now you can generalize #metoo you idiot. 
$C: yeah, but the political slant is one way or another. We all know Fox is right and CNN left. Both have their talking points and both do exactly as expected.        
Again, I'm not saying I think it's good, I'm just poiting out that this works all around the board. It's no conspiracy, this is just real life media. No pun intedended, but this is old news.
$C: I get your points. When I think fake news I also think about things that could be true, but used to make people think they are important. “OMG omg omg guess what?! The sky is blue” I would consider fake news. And yes. Again I get your point of how people could divide that as clickbait and the term fake news could make people think it was untrue. Even if the sky is not always blue ;) 

And yes, I fully agree that the video OP posted stands on its own merit. Even over on T_D we don’t care if sinclaire is pro trump or not, that shit should not stand. One person having that much control is a problem. Even if the guy thinks he’s doing the right thing, there’s ALWAYS bias. And humans pushing their ideas/morals on others has never been very fair, but usually only seen in deep retrospect. But then we get into concern trolling and it breaks down again. It all goes back to why people are saying they do or don’t  like something. I doubt we can ever possibly know, let alone care about what _everyone_ thinks. 

Now I’m ranting. I’m tired af 

Peace for now my man. I’ll end with the tl;dr that I agree with your last paragraph too. 
$C: I too hope for a statement about this. 

It’s funny though. The more I think about it, the more I feel like, the root of the message was good. But when shown in this context. It’s pretty damning. Or at least, shows hypocrisy. I’ll get some sleep and watch the source videos if I can find them. Though I doubt it will change my original feeling (which was disgust in sinclair etc)

Also, thanks for being cool to chat with. You seem like a cool dude/dudette for putting up with my tired banter. 
$C: I see your angle now. Not interested in further discussion.
$C: I donno What to believe anymore. 
$C: Lmfaooo you're right it isn't fair to compare the statements. Dawn manipulated people into buying soap by appealing to their sense of morality, telling them they can help save animals that those evil oil companies are killing by buying their soap. Sinclair basically said check your sources. You're the one who's angry because I'm not upset about this Sinclair guy and you're also too ignorant to understand why; the amount of irony in this thread is fucking hilarious. And read your last sentence to yourself please, because you still haven't explained what I'm supposed to be afraid of and what to do about it. You're talking about this guy forcing his views on us when anyone can change the channel at any time, and his message is watch out for false news on social media. Lmfaoo you may wanna get checked out for paranoia buddy. 
$C: Awww that's adorable lol someone challenged your views and you're trying act like a troll because you can't come up with anything other than "forced message!" Lmfao You're like an autistic dog trying to catch it's tail.
$C: How? That's an easy question. They scramble for anything they can call news because they are rapidly becoming irrelevant. I haven't had cable in my house for ~5 years. They are losing viewers and therefore losing the power to influence and control people, in a political manner or otherwise. I get info from a lot of places. I don't feel obligated to tell you any of them because you don't actually care, you just want criticize whoever it is.
$C: No corporate media is, they have an agenda, it was used during the election to support Hillary and attack trump. This is just obvious to anyone but the sheep.
$C: How can Sinclair be a monopoly if they’re the fifth local network?  Especially when everyone has cable, and everyone has the internet?

No one can corner the market on information.  If Sinclair is broadcasting crap, their viewers will flee, followed by their advertisers.  You can’t force a political agenda on people.  

You can, however, meet an unmet need, which Sinclair obviously is doing, given the growth in their business 
$C: I mean if some one genuinely believes our water is drugged with the intent of infertalizing our nation, if they genuinely believe that 666 = 33+33 = pi, and don't just think that's funny while listening to the rest of the show (which often has decent points, but sane and rational statements don't make for good headlines or memes so they're left out), then that's genuine delusion. You can't debate with delusion. Maybe we're surrounded by the mentally unstable and ill or more likely most people are more than capable of making that distinction between absurd, and just another viewpoint/opinion, for themselves. Colbert and John Oliver do the same thing on the opposite end of the argument. They also have great points, but they're also comedians, so to take every word they speak as gospel is also delusional. But most people I know are able to make that separation on the left, I'm willing to give the right the benefit of the doubt. Like the guy said, people on the right aren't stupid. Couldn't agree more with your polarization point though
$C: I thought we were talking about the media?  Now it's about me?  Make up your fucking mind here. 
$C: Oh I’m not, but I also don’t want to live life with a pitchfork in my pocket.

$C: What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

Business pays off government.

Business begins crafting legislation to further their interests and uses their bought politicians to pass it.

Natural monopolies are all around us but based on what you are saying I don't think you are using the term correctly.  What do you consider a natural monopoly?
$C: You literally said that.
$C: The way they get off on thanking anyone that wears a military uniform having no idea what they've done, creeps me out.

you never *had* a point. 

You said, objectively there is no nobility in sacrifice for country. 

Except you just agreed that it's entirely subjective.

So objectively, some people will subjectively find the act noble. Therefore, there objectively can be nobility in serving your country, as long as the person doing so is of that disposition 
$C: A response like that is a shortcut to thinking 
$C: Thank you for your shallow pedantry. 
$C: That's probably true. I'll trim it down next time.
$C: Oh man. That post history. So much /r/conspiracy. Sorry your mind is shot.
$C: Public broadcasters are structured to be independent from politics. That's not how it works at all. And no the outcome is literally completely different. This idea that public broadcasters and explicit privatized conservative propaganda are the same thing is hilarious. 
$C: I would say it's probably not *one thing*. It's gonna be a multi-faceted effort to deal with ignorance in our society. We have to get the media under control, we have to get our education system completely fixed up, we need our public mental health systems available to everyone so people don't slip through the cracks, and we need to guarantee children in poor families aren't suffering. I think if we do all these things, we'll be in a much better place than we are now. I think give us a hundred years, and we could probably accomplish this stuff so long as we don't kill each other in the mean time.

There's no single answer to this. The problem is much bigger than you and me, it's going to require all of our hard work to fix this nation. After all, what is a nation without it's people, and what are a people without their nation?
$C: Trying to think of a way to say "make social", as in "of the people" without meaning "make public/government run". Best way I could think of is to reappropriate by specifying that I don't mean nationalization.
$C: > are any of these stations the only station in their local area

Yes, all of these stations have a monopoly. A city has one news network, generally. Sometimes two in bigger cities, but sinclair doesn't own broadcasting rights in bigger cities anyways. Every one of these stations has a monopoly on dissemination of information via television in their area.

The issue with them giving the same message is that that message is determined by a select group of people, and those people have an agenda. Their goal is to convince Americans black people are out to get them, that police are there to protect them, that certain political policies are bad, that immigrants aren't people, and most of all, they're out to scare people. 

Scaring people generally gets them to turn against others more easily, and that's the end goal for sinclair. They want to divide the population. The people who watch their channels have *drastically* different opinions from everyone else. This is bad for our democracy because we're giving one very small group of people a disproportionately large voice.
$C: [yeah i figured as much but thats a really dumb way to look at it](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/88ll08/this_is_what_happens_when_one_company_owns_dozens/dwlr4k5/)
$C: second world only if youre talking about cold war political camps. which considering 30 years have passed since the collapse of communism in eastern europe, poland has the 7th largest military in NATO, and the vast majority of poles have no living memory of communism, that terminology is about as relevant as calling the UK part of the triple entente or germany and japan axis powers. if by "second world" you're trying to imply that poland is somehow not a "developed" country compared to the "first world", then pretty much any metric disproves that. poland is not the wealthiest country, within the EU its in the middle of the pack for gdp per capita, but i dont think there's a credible argument against it being an industrialized highly socially and economically developed country, aka, what most laypeople would refer to in short as a "first world" country 
$C: The meaning of words can shift, especially when those words are used to describe a position in the geopolitical order, which has changed drastically since the fall of the Iron Curtain.
$C: Yes, because I vote for people to represent me in government.
$C: > that is designed to harm.

Conservatives see it as a product designed to defend yourself. And yes, views about lobbying and political sacrifices are heavily influenced by political leanings. 

To me, I see abortion as killing a human, but I don't hold humans lives all at the same level. I'm not a hypocrite and will not tell myself a unborn child isn't a human being to not face the fact the act is reprehensible, but sometimes necessary. Same with taxes. It's immoral, but justified in some cases, just like killing someone else. Where this is justified is really where I draw the line differently.

Conservatives do hate RINOs and corrupt politicians. The difference is conservatives don't have the convenient "for the greater good", "for the little folks" cover the left always uses to cloak its actions and are far easier to criticize because of it. A current example is the democrats and anti-gunners using children to hide behind and throwing a fit about "they're just children", "you support killing children" every time someone pushes back against them with the same force they'd push back against anyone in the public forum.

Conservatives do accept that no one is without sin tho, especially religious ones, which is their great weakness. They'll believe someone like Ted Nugent somehow wants to be on the path to redemption when he's not. That a number of other conservatives care about marriage and are just good people struggling to better themselves, which is obviously not the case.

I see it this way. People on the left cloak themselves in well meaning rhetoric to try and hide their actions, and many on the left let them do it. So they'll believe the message is more important than the actions and their effects. Because how come socialism is evil and kills the little people when it's about giving power to the workers and common folks. How can communism always lead to totalitarian regimes when communism says it is a stateless society? That's what the left does well. Conservatives don't cloak themselves, but their voters disregard a lot of it because "blame the sin, not the sinner". So they'll have a guy 3 times divorced doing drugs and sleeping with prostitutes and tell themselves he's just "struggling" but that because he's "religious" or says he is and conservative he must seek redemption somehow. So they'll excuse the transgressions. The right excuses transgressions by claiming people seek redemption/salvation while the left hides them behind rhetoric. Both his a failure and shows weak character.

There are few things that are deadly sins to conservatives, pretty much everything can be excused if the person claims he wants to be better. It's a weakness politically, because that's a great way to get people who have no right to be in positions of authority in those positions. He's not an evil bastard, he's just "struggling to become a good person". He said he "wanted to do better, and he's sorry". Who's "without sin"? etc.

The left, on the other hand, will shield itself from criticism by defining themselves and using that definition as a cover and by using euphemisms and other tactics to push their ideas. They'll excuse their failures as "not being their ideology" by using their convenient definition of their ideology. It's not killing an unborn child, it's "terminating" a pregnancy. It's "pro-choice". It's "common sense" gun control. They "don't want to come for your guns". They're "children and mass shooting victims" and you shouldn't go after them because they're sacrosanct. It's not wealth redistribution and socialism it's "the rich paying their fair share". Unions are "for the good of the worker" and "everyone benefits from them". etc.

Both sides will excuse the failings of their own party in their own ways. One will just ignore glaring problems in their party, the other will excuse glaring misconduct without a real reason to.

One other thing that could explain how the liberals are more willing at pointing out those democrats is that there's a huge variety of liberals and a large pool of activist types to replace them. Today classical liberals are right of center and are big critics of the democratic party. There isn't the same variety in conservatism and there aren't that many conservative activists compared to the left, so many make do with what is available politically, which isn't always the best representatives. Great conservatives hate politics and prefer being business people, it lends itself a lot more to their temperament. So in addition to having a way smaller pool of activists and statists in general, they have that painful habit of forgiving misconduct.
$C: It’s actually not naive to assume otherwise, it’s naive to believe that the system of laws in this country and political participation of the general population has no impact on the actions the government takes. 

America has a significant problems with its political system, economic equality, and society in general. To chalk these problems up to things “being rigged” is the peak of crack pot conspiratorial thinking. America is far too chaotic and expansive for any small group to control it. 

I’m not a libertarian but yeah I go to college and try to get my ideas from academics and experts instead of YouTube and reddit. Besides that, why would my self identified political affiliation have anything to do with the validity of my arguments? 

I’m just going to stop. You can’t argue with an idiot. 
$C: Yeah I was mainly saying "get money out of politics" as a shorthand for enforcing the emoluments clause, providing transparency in donations, and limiting the range of probable quid pro quo situations. I think too many people are fatalistic regarding those sorts of things. There's a vast difference in the amount of nepotism, unprincipled use of government funds, and overall corruption to now than under the previous head of the executive branch.
$C: Y’know, except for that whole “Republicans existing” thing, your second point might be valid. It’s just a simple fact that it’s much harder to be proactive in our system than it is to obstruct, and even a *whiff* of antitrust reform and business regulation (i.e. “job-killing Communism”) triggers the Republicans like crazy.
$C: >Idiot.

What a level headed and mature way to discuss an issue.

I never called you a Republican, I just claimed that the tactic is one they love to use. They also resort to petty name calling. 

Democrats are constantly held accountable. And if you read their party platform you'd see what they run on. But nobody wants to talk about the issues so you won't see it at the top of your favorite subs or media sources any time soon.

$C: I’ve been door to door canvassing and talking to people for my political party of choice every single election since 2000. It is a little daunting at first but you quickly get over it. Some folks will talk, some won’t. It’s more effective than robo calls and many other forms of reaching out.

$C: Yes, Mr. Third Way himself signed this in alliance with a then Republican Congress. As much as I’m not a huge fan of Democrats, it seems unfair to judge them based on the actions of the guy who basically said “let’s be republican lite guys, that’s our new strategy”. 
$C: Oh you mean the FCC that enacted the Title II, i.e. net neutrality, regulations in 2015? That Democrat-appointed FCC?

During Obama's term the Republicans retook the House and Senate. The President doesn't create legislation. This is exactly why the midterms this November are so important. 
$C: See, you're wrong. The FFC stopped enforcing the fairness doctrine in 87....under republican rule. While you're correct in that the FFC removed it from the rules book under Obama, the 90's had nothing to do with it. 

Tom Wheeler was far from a lobbyist approved appointee. If he had been then he'd still be in control of the FCC, rather we have the shit-stain on the human race that goes by the name of Ajit Pai to lead it who might as well have Verizon tattooed on his forehead. 
$C: You don't know what you're talking about.

$C: I remembered learning about it in history class, but couldn't remember the intricacies of it. It kind of bothers me that these companies now have grown so big without interference because, with the steps the country took against monopolies back then, we obviously have precedent to stop it

$C: Google has a ton of products sure but 90% of its profit comes from advertising (and that is split half-half between Search and Display ads). And whether collecting data is harmful to consumers, that’s up to each individual consumer to decide, not you or me. If they don’t like it they can just delete their account and stop using google.

Personally, I’m 100% comfortable with Google knowing every detail about my life. Same with Facebook. The only thing they fucked up is recklessly letting 3rd party dev access it without sufficient control process.

He is a single person with biased opinions.  Just like you and I are.  

Accepting his opinion just because he says it, is no less dangerous than accepting the opinion of a group of people who are all saying the same thing. 

You can deny that logic, but then you are just being as close-minded as anyone you would criticize.

Then please, verify it. Because it's been going on since before the printing press. Hearst ran a media empire and used it to push anti-weed propaganda. Or do you not know who that is?

$C: Relevant username. Dumb as a fucking rock. 
$C: shove your false equivalency up your browneye
$C: No, don’t vote for people based simply on their party, vote for them on their morals and past character. Voting simply on a party is like throwing the dice and hoping you come out with something good. Do some research on the candidates, it’s worth it.
$C: lol, hope is all your votes are. You're not actually accomplishing anything by voting; you're just *hoping* the person you vote for does what they promised..
$C: It's really bad. I'm with you, and all for voting to see a change. But what's surfacing seems to be the tip of the iceberg for the kind of nasty shit that's going on behind the scenes. The 2nd amendment may become a lot more relevant in the not so distant future. 
$C: It’s true, they don’t look at what really works and instead endeavor to just take power away from the people. The government are not our friends.
$C: Armed security like the shooting in Maryland that was stopped within 60 seconds by an armed school resource officer, with no one but the shooter fatally wounded.
$C: for real - by this logic we should legalize heroin because outlawing it “doesn’t work”
$C: >My point is, most people who defend the 2nd amendment use that excuse "it's so we can defend ourself from tyranny". 

It's not an excuse. It is literally the entire reason the second amendment exists.

>I call bs on that, just be honest about it, it makes you feel safe and powerful. 

Because it makes you safe and powerful..

>Nothing wrong with wanting to feel that way, but it's complete bs that any of you is willing to fight tyranny. If handing taxes to the top 1% while they already own the majority of the world's wealth while millions die isn't tyranny, man I don't fuckin know what is.

First of all, the second amendment already prevents tyranny because it is a good deterrent for government overreach. 

Second of all, letting the people that pay the most taxes keep more of their money with a tax cut is not tyranny and the fact that you say that shows how spoiled to the bone you are. 

Real tyranny is being arrested for saying something your government disagrees with, your family being used as leverage to silence you, your government being in total control of who gets to eat and who doesn't, your government breaking down the door of your neighbours  and putting them on a truck to only god knows where never to be seen again, your government lining random civilians against the wall and shooting them in the back of the head as retaliation for an attack of the resistance, being send to a work camp for owning a radio or reading the wrong newspapers, I can go on and in.

It is revolting that you believe other people not being forced to hand over more of their own money to pay for the things you want and benefit from is anywhere close to tyranny.
$C: Because we’ve allowed the line to get pushed further and further and it shouldn’t have been allowed. They’re going to keep pushing until we’re powerless, and we need to stop it. Now.

$C: [deleted]
$C: Are you literally retarded?
$C: Yup, that was a collaboration between big tobacco and the Koch brothers 
$C: Not quite. The tea party was originally basically a genuine grassroots, Ron Paul loving party, opposed to the wars, the drug war, and Authoritarianism, as well as taxes, welfare, and other things that libertarians see as big government. The Koch Brothers saw something worth hijacking, and within months, it was something completely different, totally co-opted by big corporations and the religious right. Basically, the extremist wing of the republican party, instead of the genuinely libertarian wing as it originally was. 
$C: No no no, it's not  called bribing,  that's illegal.  You can't bribe politicians, jeez.

 Lobbying,  on the other hand,  that's completely fine, encouraged even.  

Bribing a politician is saying "hey,  we'll give you  $10,000 to vote this way" and that's totally illegal,  really frowned upon :(

Lobbying,  however,  is way different.  See,  lobbying is a corporation saying "I'll donate $10,000 to your political party if you'll vote my way and by the way,  if you keep playing ball by voting my way in the future when you retire from public service in a few years when you're 45 we'll have a nice cushy consultants job paying 6 figures a year waiting for you when you can start accepting bribes a.k.a when you are not a voted in official"

See?  Huge difference between bribery and lobbying. 
$C: Got away from them? They just got a tax cut worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 

They don’t give a fuck about anything beyond that. 
$C: It’d be fascinating if you could listen in on all their plans, know the entire, unfiltered thought process behind their strategy, and what they expected to happen vs reality.

Unfortunately, we can’t put a microwave in their head
$C: Because they're somehow gaining from it even if indirectly. Their comment is common sense; someone that has more to lose due to deregulation isn't going to ask why we need regulation. The people that stand to gain from deregulation in some way are going to be the ones asking why we need it. Their comment isn't exactly a profound realization.
$C: This is why we should vote on issues/policy rather than politicians/personalities.
$C: And the age of consent
$C: and guns 
$C: You didn't specify. But would you be ok with safety deregulation? I'm not claiming all regulation is good, but lots of times when regulation is repealed because "it's not needed anymore" it's because the regulation is doing its job, so repealing it just ends up causing problems. If it can be demonstrated that a regulation is actively harming things, then yes, it should be repealed.
$C: It's a true libertarian utopia, like the good old days of the late 19th century/early 20th century.  Ya know, "the children working in mines" golden age.
$C: > when they are told what to say by an overloading figure is an oxymoron

$C: To be fair there have been many wars throughout history simply because one group thought another group was wrong. I'm not so sure it has to do with the coming generations or if it's just our nature.

$C: Fox News isn't even close to the worst anymore with Brietbart around.

Hell Brietbart actually makes Fox's tag line of "Fair And Balanced" seem almost true; they should add a 'comparatively' to the start of that, and then I'd agree with it.

$C: Maybe I missed it but where is he saying that fox is the only 1
$C: Reading not your strong point, eh?

$C: U  R  robat.
$C: Your review is about as close as you can get to being objectively wrong. Most people really enjoyed that movie.
$C: If two people commit a crime, and one person's crime is more severe than the other's, that doesn't absolve the other one. Yes, there's a difference between these clowns all reading the same script and those other clowns all reporting the same story and agreeing to put the same deliberate spin on it, but to say "there's nothing wrong" with that is asinine.

Both groups can be trash for different reasons. If you think there's nothing wrong with nytimes just because there's something bigger wrong with these fucks, you're clearly not interested in what's good for the people, you're just interested in what's good for the people when it benefits your ideology or politics or whatever motivates you.
$C: I grew up listening to NPR for a good, solid look at both sides, and it's definitely not how it used to be. Once you see them consistently lie about things you know, the facade falls away. It's an echo chamber now and getting worse every day.

$C: Mmm, "leftist", what a totally rational and non-biased person says.

Do they make even stupider conservatives or are you the top model?
$C: Ok, there's some history here, but generally speaking there was a media hangout group where they discussed how the media at large was going to respond to events, to present a unified front. No dissent was allowed. Basically, it was 'how do we best present this worldview most of us have.' 

No consultation was made with the readership, as it is a niche hobby, and there (at the time) were no real, true, alternative markets. 

Well, how often do we see headlines in the modern media spin cycle that basically are clones of one another, similar to this by Sinclair? "Dark" times for Trump's presidency was covered by social anthropologists, noting the parroted language throughout the media; in the same way Trump would label his opponents, the media was now attempting to label his presidency before it had even begun, and this would continue. 

There are articles that share phrasing, keywords, and more, and it's indicative of the same level of pushing an agenda across multiple platforms and papers, and one could theoretically piece together a similar piece like we just saw in the original vid, but using online news articles.

[And here's another one from a leftish media outlet this time](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-lashes-alt-left-charlottesville-fine-people-sides/story?id=49235032)  
I think pretty much everyone, regardless of political affiliations, was appealed by that comment. It was still fake news according to Trump.  
Verbatim :  
"You had some very bad people in that group. You also had some very fine people on both sides" (That group referring to a gathering of white supremacist carrying torches and chanting anti-semitic songs)
$C: So he, or a company owned by him, owns all these companies?
$C: Woop, there it is!
$C: So, that's a no on a left leaning conglomerate buying up local news stations, then? Yeah, we get that between Fox, MSNBC, and CNN, two of those lean left, the other to the right, but we're talking local news here, the stuff you don't typically associate with partisan propaganda.
$C: Fine. Name all of these leftist media owners, their share(s) of control over total broadcast media market, and what makes them explicitly leftist. Go ahead, I'll wait.

$C: r/politics is hardly radical left wing. Its by most political standards quite conservative.
$C: The sphere of American politics is so far to the right that you end up having this argument over and over where what people call left wing is just less right wing.

There is no Labour party in America, hence no left wing, hence people calling progressive conservatives lefties and calling "Liberal" half a shade from socialism. Its goofy as fuck.

For fucks sake this tool had the audacity to say Obama "saved the economy." Yes, handing the banking gods 3 trillion dollars($3,000,000,000,000 for perspective) and jailing absolutely no one but one unimportant scapegoat, even though it was crystal clear that illegal activities were knowingly occurring, sure did save our economy! Lucky us!
$C: >Considering that Obama spent his entire presidency blaming Bush, I don't think the economy was ever saved 

There's no logic in your claim, but proof?

>You mean like the nightmare that's occurring right now as more and more people notice the sharp rising costs of their premiums as the ACA takes effect? 

Sure, costs have continued to rise, but generally they've done so at a slower pace than beforehand. It also doesn't help that many states haven't been allowing the ACA to fully go into effect.

>Right, because North Korea just got their bomb last January, right after the inauguration, and ISIS really was just a B team after all, and the 80's called and asked for their foreign policy back so Russia was never actually a problem until they rigged the election for Trump 

This is just one long non-sequitur, none of what you said is a counterpoint to the alleged safety of the US throughout the previous presidency. Was NK launching strikes at the US that I wasn't aware of? Does a comment about ISIS elevate the threat of ISIS?

>I mean, why would they? They have CNN, MSNBC, Huffington Post, Vox, Comedy Central, HBO........

Also, I don't recall Obama blaming Bush. His supports certainly did, but I don't remember him ever saying anything along those lines, while Trump blames Obama and Hillary for his shortcomings on a daily basis. Both sides do it.

In terms of healthcare, though, Obamacare actually did help a lot of people. Sinclair and other right-wing media spun it as a failure, but many, many people benefitted from it. You know what does suck? Trump's changes to the way pre-existing conditions work in health care. I no longer receive coverage for the pills I have to take every day to make sure my heart stops. That's a fucking problem.

And is it really that surprising for liberals to call conservatives racists when common insults for Obama were "monkey," "ape," and "n****r?" That's... Kinda racist. Sure, there's lots of unwarranted finger pointing at the right, but when the current Republican president has the active, outspoken support of the neo-Nazi party, the KKK, and other white supremacist organizations, it's hard not to call his supporters "racists" and "Nazis." Some of them are.

Obama was by no means a great president. His administration had many, many issues. The person you responded to clearly has a warped perception of the man. But he also wasn't a bad president, and the things you're parroting ironically suggest you've fallen for the propaganda spewed by the stations above. Sinclair is winning, and you're proof.
$C: I guess we will need two or three arc-welders helmets his supports got on right now.
$C: I’m amazed at all the right wingers i this thread that think this video is about liberal media control when in reality it’s Sinclair a known super hard right wing company that loves coordinated propaganda. This is the GOPs propaganda wing
$C: you really do like reading things and putting your own spin on them, dont you.

Its about the greater good, at no time at all did i say that one side was not less terrible than the other, i said they were both terrible. You should be fighting against both.

Sanders should be your president, its the democrats fault he isnt, not trumps. Fight both sides.

$C: Bush was a warmonger. Obama was a warmonger. Trump is a warmonger. They don't need to take political sides when it comes to war because both parties are on the same side. 

I'm not holding trump to a higher standard, Obama just wasn't nearly at much at war with Fox as Trump is with every news organization but Fox. In either case, Obama was not transparent at all, so I am in no way defending his relation with the media
$C: Disagree somewhat. 

Tucker Carlson brings on a kid in a college class who is upset and says "This is what liberals believe." 

Anderson Cooper has Trump supporters (Jason Miller, Jeffrey Lord before he went too far into the Nazi-talk) who *actually worked on the Trump campaign*. 

Then he has David Axelrod or Van Jones, both of whom worked for Obama. Or Jennifer Palmieri who worked for Clinton.

$C: And I’m talking about the level of bias.  Go watch Fox News for a week, and then watch any other news channel for the following week.  You’ll see a marked difference in not only the information presented, but HOW it’s presented.  Fox will have on a commentator that no one has ever heard of to defend someone else’s words.  Other channels will attempt to have the actual speaker of those words on to defend them.

One is a cargo cult, the other is the real thing, warts and all.
$C: Just stop, dude. 

You’re clearly too lazy or too incompetent to make any sort of argument. 
$C: Who is we and what am I getting out of?
$C: I'm not licking boots either. I just happen to be able to recognize that the world isn't just black and white. There are bad cops, good cops, cops who are good people and do bad things, cops who are bad people who do good things, and cops who are just trying to earn a paycheck.

Just because you can't be bothered to think about anything objectively doesn't make your worldview the correct one. It's pathetic. 
$C: You do you, zir
$C: Not an argument
$C: It's not a guess.  A Christmas present segment isn't a "must run" because there's no reason for it to be a must-run.  There's no reason why their parent company gives a flying fuck whether or not they air a story about Christmas presents.  That makes absolutely no sense.

OP's segment is must-run because the parent company Sinclair has a lengthy history of forcing stations to air must-run segments exactly like this one.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FibjgontIo

"National correspondent" in the above case means a Sinclair reporter.

Your comment, meanwhile, is a guess, and a very bad one at that because there's absolutely no rational thought behind it.  You're reaching beyond belief to figure out a way to stay in denial about this.
$C: Apparently McCarthy was right after all: guilt by association is totally legit now, you guys.  Seriously though, you don't seem to understand what a Nazi actually is.  It is a specific political identity.  It's not whatever you, like, totally think, man.  Trump is a moron, he may even be bigoted, but he's not a Nazi.  That this even has to be said is just pathetic.  

I don't think the Democrats have a soft heart for Nazis, even though they associate with Louis Farrakhan, whose anti-semitism would make Richard Spencer blush.  Lets play a fun game.  You try to guess which of the following were said by Hitler, and which by Farrakhan.  

> “The Jews have control over those agencies of government.  When you want something in this world, the Jew holds the door.”

>“Powerful Jews are my enemy.”

>"Of course, they [the Jews] have a very small number of people but they are the most powerful in the world, they have the power to do good and they have the power to do evil...Now what do the Jews do best? Well, they have been the best in finance that the world has ever known...They finance a lot of stuff in the world, and there's nothing wrong with that, but they are not good politicians, they are the worst politicians because they don't recognize really their friends and as well their enemies..."

>“White people running Mexico are Mexican-Jews.”

If you guessed Farrakhan for all of them, you would be correct!  This does *not* mean that Obama is a Nazi, even though he glad-handed the guy repeatedly during his election run.  


$C: What? You haven't been following very closely then. There wasn't concrete evidence a year ago, but that has changed. 

Trump certainly has behaved like he is scared of Putin. And if you had followed the slow trickle of information during the last six months you would know that the connections are quite concrete at this point. His campaign had numerous ties to Putin and frequently communicated with Russia both during and after the election. And it's been confirmed that it was Putin's intelligence agency that hacked and leaked the DNC emails.
$C: I won't. But I agree my "tribe" probably would be happy for anything that seemed to help accomplish political goals. In the long term, it would just be another major factor that undermines democracy (like corruption and apathy).

That's why we need to push back before it becomes the norm.
$C: You still haven't shown where they post fake news stories. If you think that it counts as fake news, even if they post an apology and a retraction, then every news organization is fake news.

$C: In general, facts agree with liberals. Gays are born that way. Evolution belongs in school, not creationism. Climate change is real. Fracking is bad for the environment. There is no clean coal. Corporations take advantage when there are no regulations (see video in this post for an example). Teaching sex Ed over abstinence prevents pregnancy.
$C: Respect is earned and as far as I'm concerned you deserve less than zero, but that's just my opinion man.
$C: You're a Russian bot.  Glad to know that my opinion of you is respected ;).
$C: I fail to see how that makes them bad? Are you saying the dossier is fake? Because it's very much real. And being the first network to report on it should be commendable, no?
$C: not to mention the stuff they resort to like the doxing of someone for posting a meme they didn't like and harassing random people that supported trump. plus the attempt to direct people away from the leaks, and the lack of sources in their articles. they don't even hide their bias anymore.
$C: For the sake of your dignity, I really hope someone is paying you to act this stupid
$C: Great. Tell me something I don't know. Now why didn't the great US, MAGA Trump release his tax returns?
$C: Exactly. It's only a conspiracy theory when I don't believe it! - the left
$C: Glad I could spread the love ;) It's definitely improved my reddit experience massively.

BTW if you have trouble getting the "H" to show up it's because you have to actually moderate at least one subreddit. Just create one if you need to, doesn't matter if it's an empty sub.
$C: what man? I was making the point that people that don't like T_D and want to ban it should just stay away from the sub

Edit: you are correct though, as when i was typing my comment i didn't consider that liberals would read T_D to get the other POV. But T_D isn't meant to be a sub for liberals and conservatives to debate, we have another sub for that, or sometimes i head to the depths of r/politics for that
$C: I agree and would happily say goodbye to fox with the rest of them.
$C: Goddamn, you right. Wait, what is zeitgeist?
$C: We're implying that you are too stupid to understand that a Sinclair news station on Fox's airwaves is fundamentally different from Fox News, even after it was explained to you.

Fox News owns zero local news stations.  Fox Media Group leases their airwaves to Sinclair, who owns many local news stations.

So, your local news station on Fox has absolutely nothing to do with Fox News, even if the channel owners have the same parent company.
$C: Hahaha! Whatever you say halfwit. 
$C: Agreed. It gets hard to focus on the important issues when news is being tweaked to also fulfill your daily dose of drama. Let people tune into soap operas for petty and frivolous bickering. There are narratives in place for most media sources and it's annoying to watch them all reaching to get there. 
$C: It was the fault of the guy that started all the wars in the Middle East. 
$C: Google it. More civilian casualties already. Actually, more in his first 10 months, but he’s a fucking hero. 
$C: It's not true he doesn't have a source
$C: It’s [well known and documented ](http://www.newsweek.com/how-many-times-trump-cheated-wives-780550)  that Donald Trump cheats on his wives. He admits to it. It was part of the reason why he paid Ivana more than she was entitled to in her prenup, the other reason it was more was to get her to drop her rape charges against him. 

Find me a source that is even remotely reputable that proves Obama cheated on Michelle with gay lovers. 
$C: Lol what in God’s name are you even talking about. Proof about the Obama stuff or gtfo. 
$C: Doh
$C: >You assume too much, and twisting terms into catch-alls because you feel you have a monster to slay doesn't actually help you.

I wonder if you see the irony in this statement 🤔

>Yes, there are capitalistic characteristics in a mercantile economy; however, all capitalism means is free competition, free entry into the marketplace, and private ownership of profits.

Capitalism is the when the means of production are privately owned and operated for profit. Regulation does not factor into whether or not a country is capitalist.


 >When you use a taxpayer-funded agency to REMOVE competition, that's certainly not capitalism, and that's what we have with the FCC.  

Regulated capitalism is still capitalism, it doesn't turn into mercantilism if you regulate it.
$C: no, you're a anti-anti who thinks that owning the right to broadcast memes is equivelent of a broken system, when the internet in a hundred ways would allow you to propagate your message, but since your message  like a million others, is just as shitty as nazis, it's going to go no where.

This type of false equivelence is propaganding because there's obviousness in truth: things that benefit society will propagate further and longer than those that don't. But a wild fire will also burn brighter and hotter and destroy everything in it's path. 

NAzism is a failure, and so are the ideas that we should find each and every institution because some how the government is to blame for everything even when any idiot can put up their own internet station. Yet what actually propagates is shutter shit like info wars.

do you see info wars going anywhere, despite it's absolute shit devoid of reality?

No? then what the fuck equivocation are you discussing
$C: "My name is jihad, so clearly i aim to be taken with a grain of salt"

Conspiracy theorist. How? Or do you wanna define what that means, you can't find anything that is actually wrong with anything I said 
I post about Alex Jones? Where is that? I think Jones is the same as the rest of the media, so yeah your wrong bout that

$C: See also climate science and abstinence only education.  The right doesn’t like evidence based approaches 
$C: Pence... is that close enough for you? It doesn't get much more hard-line Evangelical than Pence. Now I'm definitely not saying that I have a source that says he is specifically trying to bring about the rapture, but if you know any hard-line evangelicals, it's kind of just a given already. I'm surrounded by them in the South and that is their excuse for a lot of things, that it really doesn't matter because according to the prophecies were already getting very close to the Rapture, so any little thing they can do to help it along is not something they consider a bad thing. We haven't had someone who is as deeply radicalized overrtly Evangelical Christian as Pence this close to the president ever, that I'm aware of. That should absolutely terrify everyone who isn't a fan of Pence. There's a good reason why plenty of people are equally as scared, or even more scared, of a possible Pence presidency than a Trump presidency, because Donald either gets killed, goes to jail, resigns, or is impeached. 


This is no conspiracy, it's a fact and you would know that for sure if you were surrounded by as many of these idiots as I am on a daily basis.


And he is just simply the second in charge. There is an absolute plethora of these idiots funding this entire thing from behind the scenes, like Mercer and countless others, who absolutely think they have a very good reason, and cause, to let this country and the world go to complete shit. Like I said, there are tons of different orchestrators in this orchestra, but there's a decent chunk of those that make up that pie that are hard-line evangelicals and wish for nothing more than to see this world burn because they think that literally means their time has come to be praised upon by Jesus for what great believers they have been.


And it should tell you a lot if my number one example is literally the second most powerful man in the world, considering he is the first in line of succession if something happens to the president of United States. It also seems, based off of your comment, that you've never really been to one of the churches and heard how they talk to each other and how their sermons go. In these radicalized churches, of which there are an incredible amount all over the country but especially the South, the talk of the Rapture is quite common as is the discussions about how they may help it along, as true believers. I promised you would have a different perspective if you spent some time with these people and then turn around to realize that it not only is the second most powerful man in this country one of these people head to toe, but so are tons of the people behind them with the money. I suppose my comment would sound kind of crazy if you've never spent much time around these types of people and see that the type of talk that just threw you off that much is absolutely commonplace amongst this group. Also they're not as much of a minority as you think, this is an absolutely huge part of the Evangelical Christian religion in the south and speckled over the entire country.


Unfortunately for us, every group in this equation was so willing to sell themselves out to get ahold of all the power that they each took absolutely any help that was available, regardless of whether or not they shared any of the same views or goals... So now these hardline christians, who would love nothing more than to see the end of the world come early, are just one piece of a very large puzzle with so many agendas and goals intertwined with each other that we should all be extremely worried right now if we cant turn things around soon.
$C: If you're talking about creating scandals out of thin air, Fox News creating a "War on Christmas" scare to get people riled up should be at the top, not something that involves seemingly visual proof of Donald Trump fucking a porn star. Or that Stormy Daniels' story is corroborated.  
$C: Trump is pure smut. Not news? Is the $130k is hush money not an illegal campaign contribution? Any other president and this alone would result in a resignation. Daily embarrassments from the White House and people like you just make excuses for him. What will it take for you to admit this guy is a joke?
$C: >Did you actually watch the interview and hear the questions she was asked? Pure smut. 

I wasn't even remarking about the interview but okay. You apparently really want to talk about this and not address their other contents as I mentioned.

And no it was not "pure smut" which makes it obvious that you did not actually watch it and likely only snitbits. 

>This was a consensual sexual encounter between two adults, way before he was president. 

No one is debating that. 

>It's not news, it's smut. The MSM, especially CNN, gave free promotion to a porn star for weeks. 

It actually is news. I wouldn't say it's a bombshell or anything unexpected. Possible campaign finance laws issues is the main thing. But it's also more proof of his disgusting behavior as a human and his inability to tell the truth when confronted with anything what so ever. Along with the new accusation that she was threatened. 

He is still denying it the affair happened. How pathetic is that. 

Consider this. If he would have just admited it front the get go it would not have **nearly** of been the story and controversy it became.

$C: god don't tell me you clowns believe this garbage. this is so sad.
$C: This is a 4chan post and the conclusions this person reaches are really far fetched. Though I agree that John Oliver is pretty ass.
$C: He's lied infinitely more than any other politician, and you're delusional if you think otherwise.  

That's not an insult, by the way.  He has lied a few thousand times since taking office and he lied countless times during his campaign.  The man is a lifelong pathological liar, and anyone who thinks he's trustworthy is a fool.
$C: And your age but you didn't correct me on that so i assume you're like 8.

Either way I shouldn't have been an ass, you're right.
$C: Find me a single example of a news article in the Washington Post that is twisting facts. 

Hint: I have a strong feeling you won’t know the difference between news and editorials. 
$C: Nah, it’s not a vital skill I need. I’m a farmer who busts my ass to feed people like you. Insult my reading comprehension all you like but I simply googled your term that you used to discredit this video and it was stated to be categorically false. But again, what does my redneck college degree ass know?
$C: CNN, like Fox and NBC and the BBC and everyone else, has intentionally lied.

Yes, Fox does it more.
$C: Ehhhh it’s trash. Faux is trash. Communist News Network is trash. But obviously everyone on Reddit loves CNN...I wonder why though? Is it because it’s a “world renown award winning respectable news agency” or cause its “news” with a leftist agenda? 
$C: [deleted]
$C: > As I said, conglomerates owning dozens of stations has existed for decades.

That's ignoring the point though.  No media company has had the same ownership reach that Sinclair currently does, so "this" specifically has most assuredly not been a thing for decades.

> You're a fucking idiot.

Sheesh, calm down pal.  No need to get riled up about all this.
$C: Dude what? ''if that dam breaks your left with nothing'' is what you said, that's incorrect. I didn't use ''your'' nor ''you're'' in my message, what are you trying to correct?



Besides, my point is that you give no argument, just the classic ''my opponent can't handle the truth!!!1!'' stuff. I could say the same about you, about anyone, it's a shallow and useless comment. Calling people who argue against you 'sheep' is even worse, only those that have no actual point or argumentation resort to it.
$C: They're against 180~ news stations being required to read scrips from corporate ownership that has nothing to do with the editorial side of the business. Since when did this become controversial?
$C: Perhaps it's just a nice jumping off point to be taken with a grain of salt. It's worth considering, though, that the 50/50 estimate may not be a reliable portrait of the media's spin.
$C: That last response didn't strike me as particularly "educated," but you do you pal.
$C: In my opinion we are an oligarchy. But that's a different discussion. 

Also it's much more complicated then just "voting them out". Congress needs a 2/3 majority to do that. It's not the peoples choice. And also voting candidates in is also much more complicated then you think. It mostly comes down to choosing between the lesser of two evils. 

Congress pretty much controls everything in this country and we don't get to vote all of them into office. Only one for our district. You should research gerrymandering because the way they draw these districts is biased and unfair.

Again, you don't realize how screwed up things are in this country. In case you forgot that the post were arguing on right now is already one of the most popular of all time. People do not want this.    But it's more complicated then you think, and blaming the people is the wrong thing to do, because we don't want this, trust me.

And I only use Trump as an example because he is the noncombatant, and in case you haven't noticed is a racist and a liar. I hate Democrats and Republicans and in my opinion they are both to blame for the shit storm right now.

I've lived here my whole life and I personally have not met one person, democrat or republican, who thinks any of the wars we have fought in in the past several decades have been just.

I urge you not to let your anger for our government cloud your judgement on the actual educated populous. 

And you have no idea what anger is by the way. This is MY government that is getting away with this and and watching this video and seeing this happen to this country is a frustration you cannot understand. Since I'm assuming you do not live here.
$C: if you were compassionate you wouldn't be right wing. if you were respectful you wouldn't like trump at all. if you believed in unity, you wouldn't alienate immigrants. Your father failed you. but I'm not surprised. He is from Mississippi.
$C: to read? yikes.. sorry to your family. you must be a real burden to them
$C: Wonderful argument. You've really convinced me.
$C: Ok comrade, enjoy being a low value/low education white male from the shitty part of the US.
$C: But that is not what is happening at all? Campellarino made up shit and got destroyed by facts. Posting a low effort meme with an alt account just continues this story. Try to argue with facts, this isn't t_d, your feelings are not relevant, only facts matter, and nobody will be banned because it hurts trump-supporters feelings. I realize you are outside of your safe space but don't expect anybody else to care.

$C: Also all of America was in support of either one. That should be your first sign that this is entertainment and business. Every company that relies on views will try to get as many as possible. News stations can report boring old news and become bankrupt, or make their stories interesting. They can lean toward republican or democrat on political stories if the majority of their viewers are either of the two, or more likely, they'll create two branches and report from each perspective so people can pick a station they feel represented by and the owner can make money from both sides. It's fucking business. They'll exaggerate storms to make people pay attention to weather, they'll tell the story before they get all the facts to be the first ones to report it. It's all for views and money. Go make your own news station reporting nothing but the truth if you're so damn passionate about it. Good luck while you're at it, because all those indie sites that wanted to be "real news", eventually became conspiracy news because all their of their viewers were conspiracy theorists and they'd either have to shut down or change their focus to make enough money to stay afloat. It's easy to talk about ideal companies and societies when you're not the one responsible for creating them and making sure they meet both moral and financial expectations.
$C: Jesus you’re dumb as shit.  0/10 debate skills 
$C: Sorry, I was being sarcastic. Republicans are not diverse.
$C: Maybe not. But if the Finns had a little time to prepare, I think they could put up a fight. The Soviet Union should have steamrolled Finland. It *should* have been over on Stalin's birthday, as Soviet leadership hoped. 

Honestly, it's all speculation and our assumptions determine the outcome. 

edit: a protracted, full scale conflict would obviously be another notch in the Russian belt. But it's possible that there are other scenarios where the outcome is not so decisive. 
$C: Depends how you measure it, some organizations claim its at 3,5% considering the cost of the indentured military servants. But yeah, Finland wouldn't stand a chance.

If you're not comfortable with the term oligarchy, call it plutocracy - I'm not calling it a conspiracy. It's natural that people vote their own interests - however, the people with the money making the rules is bad for 99% of Americans. Whether it's oligarchy or plutocracy, it's antithetical to a true democracy (and later in civics you'll learn we're a representative republic, which is another reason the notion of democracy is bullshit).
$C: Bruh Democrats do the same shit. Appeal to the highest bidder. They'll say what they have to say to get reelected, but they're just as crooked as Republicans behind the scenes

My bad. It's just that bad faith, concern-trolling shitheads really rile me up.

Kind of like exactly what you're doing.

>Democrats are constantly held accountable.

Bull-fucking-shit they are. The only people holding them accountable right now are Republicans- AND THEY ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THEM. It was Chuck Schumer that said, “For every working class Democrat we lose, we'll pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs.” That's our legislative leader saying, in public, "Yeah, we're campaigning for the Republican vote." This kind of bullshit leads to the kind of shitty centrist-dominated party and unwavering fear of big ideas we have now.

$C: [President Clinton signs the Telecommunications Act of 1996. It is generally regarded as the most important legislation regulating media ownership in over a decade. The radio industry experiences unprecedented consolidation after the 40-station ownership cap is lifted. Clear Channel Communications owns 1200 stations, in all 50 states, reaching, according to their Web site, more than 110 million listeners every week. Viacom's Infinity radio network holds more than 180 radio stations in 41 markets. Its holdings are concentrated in the 50 largest radio markets in the United States. In 1999 Infinity owned and operated six of the nation’s Top 10 radio stations.](http://www.pbs.org/now/politics/mediatimeline.html)
$C: So, because a Democrat politician does something bad, you want to claim he's not a "true" democrat. OR, both sides do shady ass shit and don't actually have your best interests at heart. 
$C: Yes, [that same 2014 FCC that introduced the end of net neutrality and started the topic in the first place by attempting to enact "fast lanes" for the internet.](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/technology/fcc-new-net-neutrality-rules.html)

The President doesn't create legislation, but the President appoints non-elected members to Executive Branch agencies like the FCC, and those unelected civil servants can't be ejected in the midterms.  They do what they want, have no voters to serve, and the last two Presidents have appointed media shills to chair the FCC.

It's a really bad idea to go partisan on this issue, Democrats created the problem, Republicans picked up the playbook and kept it going, and pretending either hoping they won't keep doing more of the same is not a formula for change.
$C: So, where does the Communication Act of 1996 fit within this narrative?
$C: It was the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that removed the monopoly protections of the media and allowed for the significant reduction of media outlet ownership. 

1996 was Clinton, just to make sure you recognize the role a Democrat politician played in this. 
$C: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Wheeler

Tom Wheeler literally was a lobbyist. Literally read the first two paragraphs.

He was also president of the NCTA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCTA_(association)

which openly lobbies against net neutrality and municipal broadband.

Also note that Ajit Pai was confirmed unanimously by the Senate under Barack Obama.
$C: You sound s-m-r-t
$C: It's not, but reality has to be faced. If all of those opposed to the current status quo don't go out and do something, be it voting or otherwise. Then we all might as well stay at home. 2016 was a perfect example of that, as were the 2010 midterms. 

History repeats, and if no one blows up the track that history is going around on, then nothing is going to change.
$C: You first. Why is that guy a shill for telling people to vote?
$C: I understand that, but note that I didn't change any of my comments once I was told that. I'll reply to shills or not all day; because shill or not, others may read them.
$C: Oh. Well someotherone else then
$C: > Personally, I’m 100% comfortable with Google knowing every detail about my life.

WHY???!!! How do you find comfort in that?
$C: lol, that's quite the assumption, I bet you don't ;)
$C: Pretty sure he does, im not certain, but im pretty damn sure he makes sure that the expensive shit that he buys is worth its money
$C: Also none of those factors ever happened. So it appears that the bar itself is a bigger failure point when its worn down.

$C: There's nothing racist in my post history. You just made that up.

In your words: "are you actually just a fucking fake piece of shit liar?"

Also, why do liberals suddenly lose all diction and self-control and start swearing when speaking to conservatives? I mean, I was *agreeing* with you, and this is still how you react? How would you react if I *disagreed* with you?

Before you post, it says "remember, be respectful to others." Did you forget?
$C: DO YOU FUCKING SEE THE LINKS I PUT UP YOU FUCK?

Not wasting time with people shoving words in my mouth. This conversation is over. "stop waving flags" asshole.
$C: It was not a repeal of Dodd-Frank
$C: Doesn't mean you shouldn't vote straight Dem though. First past the post really only allows for two parties of any significance.
$C: How so?
$C: I don't understand the point of your comment, are you implying net neutrality was only a thing because some companies could profit from it?  
$C: In the interest of full disclosure, I tend to agree with the comment you're replying to. 

It seems, from the outside, that very small groups of conservatives have bought up substantial influence in Washington and in the media. This contrasts with the massive "liberal media" that aren't organized or making concerted efforts to accomplish any specific goals, and only share similar opinions on the issues. 

Now, have I been led to believe this because the wealthy liberal families have  hidden their influence more effectively? Or can you at least give examples where one or two liberal's opinions have been forced out through many sources pretending to share those views, as is painfully illustrated by the OP's video? (Note the contrast between this video and the concept of hundreds of people who have similar, but still their own, opinions)

It's my opinion that a smaller subsection of extremely-wealthy Americans using their influence to maintain an "equal" standing to a larger, more diverse group of people has resulted in some highly irregular outcomes in the American electorate.

$C: Reagan removed the fairness doctrine. It's a valid argument. 
$C: Seriously dude go away. Facts don’t support your opinion. What about Reagan and the fairness doctrine 
$C: Look, you types are so far gone for reality and so brainwashed, you think statements of fact are political and you cant tell you are brainwashed. 
$C: The top half of what you said is true. The bottom half isn’t. You should give a shit that the president used information bought from a Russian programmer to target Americans with meme and bs news propaganda. These are two different discussions and issues. 
$C: The onus is on you to provide proof to your “leftist megaphones” statement.  You received a level headed response to your statement refuting it. 

Pull up your britches and come back with a real response or gtfo. 
$C: They are 100% corporate. The fact that you believe that this could in any way be considered "leftist" shows how little you know about state, national or world politics. 
$C: I've also watched Fox News for two decades. Fox is far right (propaganda-tier), CNN is right, and MSNBC is center-right with a few liberal editorialists.
$C: So you don’t have anything to back up your claims then? 

“Basic Logic” isn’t a source and even if it was, its very vague and subjective 
$C: The FCC only last year decided to make an exception for Sinclair. That's a little bit later than the invention of the printing press.

Way to shill. 10/10.

Please show me where a national company before now forced local media outlets to repeat their propaganda. I'm all ears.
$C: Now imagine all the people it didn’t stop working on.
$C: Go fuck yourself San Diego.
$C: I’ve got a jar of dirt!
$C: Sinclair broadcasting was a bad choice!
$C: If only OP added that at the end
$C: My allegiance is to the Republic, to democracy!

You're extremely dangerous to our democracy
$C: How come nobody says wizard anymore?
$C: I love democracy.

$C: Yippee

$C: Nuh uh
$C: >Civil Rights in the 1960s

Malcolm X was just as important as MLK but MLK's approach was nonviolent so he gets the praise for civil right movement and he taught in schools.
$C: They told you lies 
$C: Both were the non-violent faces of movements that used armed wings to great effect. Remember the Black Panthers and the later Nation of Islam?
$C: You're making a lot of assumptions. You assume rioting and revolting is torching a neighbor's business or wrecking someone's car, you're wrong. I can't even fathom how you came up with that bullshit sentiment.
$C: But is this extremely dangerous to our democracy?
$C: This is *extremely* dangerous to our democracy.
$C: Someone needs to read 1984. 
$C: Your post history has shown you have advocated for violent actions against people and if you consider yourself a voice of moral authority then standards are sorely low. 
$C: We can do that later. It’s more important that we upset the current status quo now. The current GOP is a threat to our democracy, and the best chance we have of fixing that is going solid blue for now.

By all means, vote in the Primaries and educate yourself, I know there are plenty of shitty Democrats as well, but on the whole any Democrat who sides with his party is better than any Republican who does the same.

 The point I’m trying to make is if the choices are Red, Green or Blue, don’t waste your vote on Green because it only helps Red, and we end up in this situation again.

I voted for Bernie in the Primaries, and while I wasn’t particularly excited with Hillary I still voted for her as a vote against Trump in the General, and I will continue to vote straight blue every chance I get until we can shift things back far enough that I can afford to be picky.
$C: Representative democracy can be a scary thing when the people you elect don’t actually represent you.
$C: It's pretty clear-cut who *not* to vote for. Sorting through the remaining candidates is a headache, but not difficult.
$C: Um...there was an armed guard at parkland, clearly not a definitive solution. The problem isn't solved by adding more guns, but that doesn't mean it's solved by taking away all weapons (which I'd never advocate for).
$C: We should legalize all drugs and provide help instead of incarceration but that besides the point. Not every issue is solved the same way
$C: Just because that's a FORM of tyranny doesn't mean what's happening now isn't. Also no, it's not about keeping most of their money, they have been doing that. It's about politicians being paid off by the wealthy who dictate our laws, we aren't in a democracy anymore, it's not exactly an oligarchy but it's not what democracy is supposed to be. 

Our votes don't mean as much as someone worth millions and that's a fact. Most politicians left and right are bought and paid for by organizations like the NRA. It's close to tyranny because none of what is happening now is the will of we the people, it's the will of we the 1% and that is a cold hard fact.
$C: Lol you republicans are funny, facts are bought and paid for now? Okay. Also there wasn't more votes for trump than Clinton, she got 3m more votes. I guess #s are partisan too now. You're allowed to spend millions for campaigns as other politicians have done in the past, you're not allowed to use illegal means to do so. Also for the record I'm not even a Clinton supporter so nice assumption there. I'm not saying I'm smarter, you being ignorant to politics doesn't make me smarter or you dumber, just means you don't understand it well enough to know how it affects you. I'm sure I don't understand a thing about your job, doesn't mean you're smarter, just means you understand it more than someone who has no experience with it. Also republicans only win because of an uneducated electorate which they created as well as other shady tactics like voter suppression and gerrymandering but clearly not something you'd know about as you don't follow politics. Again that's fine, but don't pretend you know enough about it to make an educated decision, as by your own admission you don't care for it.
$C: P.s. I don't JUST browse r/politics
$C: Damn, do you ever have trouble driving with that black-and-white worldview of yours?

Jokes aside, if you can't tell the difference between "We should examine how we look at this specific 'right' in order to ensure public safety" vs "We have to immediately sacrifice our rights completely" I don't know what to say.
$C: Lol you guys all do the same, insult instead of actually discussing. You've said absolutely nothing of substance instead of insults, do you people actually know how to discuss things or just strong arm people all the time cuz you're all tough boys?
$C: And yet, in common parlance, people know what you are referring to when you say  Orwellian. It has come to mean more than the author intended. Language evolves!
$C: [removed]

$C: Do you really think they are motivated by money? They have all the money they could ever spend. They're motivated by trying to make the world better (their own definition of better).
$C: Can we put their head in a microwave at least?
$C: Or rather, that is why the whole political system in the US needs to be reformed in a way that more than 2 parties are allowed.
$C: Yeah! And the...the...wait, what?
$C: Huh?
$C: Honestly Safety regulation slows down safety advances.  Why do cars all ship with 3 point harnesses, 5 point or 4 points are safer, govt regulations say all cars have to have 3 points, not 2, or 4 or 5 but 3.  
$C: I just don't get how so many people seem to be OK with fucking each other over.

Take my dog for example: if I leave a juicy piece of chicken out and turn my back, she's going to take advantage of me and eat that chicken - thing is, she's a dog, it's to be expected.

Unfortunately, many dogs seem to be masquerading as humans, eager to fuck you over the moment you turn your back. Even worse, many of these dogs in human clothing are actually proud of themselves for fucking others over...

I'm proud of being a human, not a dirty exploitative dog masquerading as a human. 
$C: Using duckduckgo is a nice start

$C: Don’t know if you read my whole post but I’m agreeing with the quote. I heard him speak on JRE a while back. Maybe you misunderstood,  I may have phrased it poorly. 

I firmly believe that all speech is free speech and absolutely nothing should be shut down in a public forum. 

Or maybe you just dislike that I used a conservative example instead of a liberal one. This is the internet in 2018, where everyone thinks their club is the best and anyone else can go rot in hell. Sorry, I have a lot more personal experience with right wing nut jobs than elitist libtards. 
$C: Reporting the truth is only a "crime" in an authoritarian state - the kind Trump routinely praises and 'jokes' about wanting to implement in the US.

I hope you actually bother to read about Sinclair and compare for yourself these mass-broadcasted, scripted opinion pieces VS real reporting. Real reporting still exists and is more valuable than ever.
$C: Examples?
$C: The fact that you automatically frame issues as having 2 sides is part of the reason I do not place much confidence in your opinion.  Some issues have way more than 2 sides, and some only have 1.

$C: Right they write those cards. But who writes the story about city council raising your property taxes? Or the house fire that displaced a family in your neighborhood?
$C: I think you’ve misunderstood me. I’m not disputing the fact that Sinclair is making its anchors read the same script to promote an agenda. I’m disputing the comment I responded to, which claims all tv news anchors aren’t real journalists and they just read what’s in the prompter. Most anchors write the local news stories they read in the prompter. And all are held to a higher standard than reporters, as they were most likely once themselves, reporters.
$C: Yes I read a great article the other day, which I can't find, that detailed exactly how your perceptions are manipulated by subtle cues that influence your thoughts on a given topic. The article was on Stephen colbert. John Oliver is basically the same sort of show and uses the same techniques. Techniques such as giving biased banter right after a political topic is brought up before the person can use their own judgements to form their own opinion, following with a laugh track to cue your mind into agreeing with the group which so obviously agrees with the man on stage. Repeat this over the whole show and subconsciously you might begin to agree with the crowd (who are strategically told when to agree with something). I hope Imy point is clear. :)

George Bush and the Republicans deregulate the banking industry causing an economic collapse in the first months of the Obama administration, and then bail those "too big to fail" banks out but some how that's Obama's fault? LOL. Obama did plenty of his own stupid shit but to pin the blame on him shows how ignorant you are of facts. Do the world a favor and sterilize yourself
$C: Not to mention the $400million to terrorists to release those prisoners 
$C: The video shows local channels owned by the Sinclair Broadcasting Group.  That's a company that is owned by a very conservative family who are avid Trump supporters.

It's your side that is doing this shit.
$C: >Obama was by no means a great president. His administration had many, many issues.

Sure, he was no Lincoln.  But how far back do you have to go to find a president that was better?
$C: Better than blindfolds I guess
$C: >. . . I said they were both terrible.  You should be fighting against both.

Funny, Putin thinks the same thing.  Forgive me if I don’t think we should be fighting against the party that WANTS to put regulations in place to stop one company from monopolizing the media in a locality, or nationally.  I’d rather improve it, not tear it down.  Bernie Sanders agrees with me.

For a guy that’s offended that I interpreted his statement that “both sides are fucking terrible” with saying both sides are the same you sure have a difficult time stating which is which.  So tell me, which side is less terrible than the other?
$C: American media has a tendency to fall into lock-step whenever it comes to the subject of foreign policy. The sheer lack of diversity in views is astonishing, and almost scary. The coverage of events is almost identical across the spectrum, regardless of political affiliation. There may be cries for different actions or policies in small contexts, but they generally advocate for the same brand of foreign policy. They only differ on subjects when its useful to slander opposing politicians at home, or appeal to a frustrated group of voters, not when they actually have a different perspective regarding American foreign policy. Because they don't, and haven't had one for decades. We don't have democratic control over our foreign policy, and its come at the cost of this nation engaging in wars without the American public having basic knowledge or awareness of where our troops are deploying and what direction our foreign policy is taking. General [Wesley Clark explained this back in 2007.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY2DKzastu8)

The most appalling part of American reporting on foreign policy is that they try to maintain the false veneer of politicians having divergent views on foreign policies. They try to paint the Republican Party as the warmongering party, or the patriotic one, depending on the source, and the Democratic Party as either the weak or peaceful party. But both parties are nearly identical in ideology and in their actions, and only disagree on extremely myopic subjects that aren't really relevant to the well-being of the American people. 
$C: What has Trump done to suggest he is a warmonger ? 
As far as I can see thus far, he has minimized involvement in Syria and not escalated engagements elsewhere. 

I never have loved his domestic politics, but one thing I have mostly agreed with is Trump’s belief that we don’t need to be sticking our nose into everyone’s business abroad.

Obama promised to get us out of the Middle East, which was a primary reason I voted for him (twice), and he never did it.
$C: Anderson cooper is about the best over at cnn, I wasn’t saying cooper uses Tucker Carlson’s tactics per say, just that the bias that exudes from him is worst than ever before. Other hosts of cnn certainly do use the tactic I was talking about, hence why I said Anderson cooper wasn’t the worst one. I may have overstepped some. Fox used to be the only ones who engaged in nonsense like that, now all the cable networks do and in spades.
$C: Lol NPR. Yeah sooo unbiased.
$C: Once agian, that is a matter of viewpoint. The left wing media will trot out children to promote an agenda that involves curtailing if endowed rights and they won’t question a single incorrect talking point while vilifying anyone who takes issue with the subject of curtailing rights. Fox, msnbc and msm are literally propaganda outlets, that is all they are. 
$C: Youre right, there are specifics and that’s it. Trump is wrong about the media all together, there is no fake news, nobody pushes any agenda, like ever, bro 
$C: I’m just saying, if my husband murdered someone and I helped cover it up I’d be going to jail too. Cops shoot someone and other cops either help cover it up or they don’t protest loudly enough. That makes them complicit. They’re criminals. That means they can’t be good cops.
$C: That’s loser talk.

It's a statement.

$C: Eh. Guilt by supporting irrational policies. But white wash what you want.
$C: Supposedly it was Russia because the timezones and exploits were used by Russia in the past, where is the concrete evidence that it was state funded, or that Trump himself knew that his campaign had ties to Russia?

I think the second we have a concrete tie it will be more than just speculation and conspiracy.  People reaching out to Trump campaign saying they have negative information on Hillary is not enough to say they were complicit.
$C: It is the norm. It's been the norm since before you and I were born.

$C: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeist) is your friend:

>The **Zeitgeist** (/ˈzaɪtɡaɪst/) is a concept from 18th to 19th-century German philosophy, translated as *"spirit of the age"* or *"spirit of the times"*. It refers to an invisible agent or force dominating the characteristics of a given epoch in world history.

...its pretty vague and I have trouble coming up with specific examples but I figure one could say you had a very nationalistic zeitgeist in many european nations in the first half of the 20th century, often the term is used in a more limited way though, to describe attitutes in certain industries at a specific time for example.

$C: Would you agree that a characteristic of ownership is control?  If you're in an economy where you don't have ultimate control of how your property is used (i.e. where/how you spend your money, what businesses you can start), you're not in a purely capitalistic economy.  There may be competition in a regulated environment, but by definition when you involve government intervention into the marketplace especially at the level of the U.S., it's no longer capitalism.  It's mercantilism.  

If all you had to do to create a TV station was to buy the equipment and hire personnel, that would be capitalism.  Because you have to go through so many hoops for approval and these hoops are designed to keep out competition,  that's East India Company level mercantilism.

I lived outside DC for 13yrs and gave Pence’s son guitar lessons back when I was in high school, 2005 while Mike Pence was just a congressman. My mom was acquaintances with Karen at the time. My parents still go to the same church that the Pence’s were a part of back then and know many of the family’s really good friends.

Now, I’m not apologizing for any of his whacky and concerning positions concerning homosexuality and all the other, am no longer a Christian myself, but I can say from firsthand experience, neither my parents nor anyone I ever met at that church while I attended were that delusional or nutty.

I used a specific example of how they behaved on that interview and other coverage and asked you if you had even seen it, specifically the interview. I'm specifically and only referencing their reporting on Stormy and how much of a shameless ratings grab it is, so that's all I could assume you were referring to. Did I say that's all they report on? No, I'm saying since that "story" broke, the majority of their breaking news and discussion with numerous anchors/pundits was this Stormy bullshit. Funnily enough they were duped by her lawyer into thinking there was a recording of some big thing and it turned out there wasn't shit. It's been that over and over since the election, a big build up saying Trump will be impeached any day now, and every time, it's a dud, they have nothing, it's all manufactured hope for your side. They are so enveloped in taking Trump down with some big story that it's consumed them and they don't even realize it. The people that watch it and believe it are the same way, deluded and consumed with Trump derangement syndrome. And you all just keep feeding off each other, going further and further into this downward spiral of rejecting the reality around you. And those of us that don't buy into the propaganda bs the MSM feeds us daily, are living happy lives because we see the reality of our country growing stronger. For ALL Americans.

$C: Theyre simple words. If 2 + 2 = 4 is on 4chan are you gonna say its not true? Didn't think so. So maybe use your brain and read the information, and decide for yourself if you can admit that it makes perfect sense
$C: Ive got a degree in psychology (not saying it means shit other than ive studied it for years) and its not at all stupid if you know anything about conditioning. Viewers are being trained to associate the opposing belief with laughable absurdity. And a feeling of moral and intellectual superiority sprinkled on top. Feels great in the brain. Do it enough times and through enough cultural mediums and it gets ingrained. You're smarter than these idiots and you're a better person. Any why question it? It's really not that hard to see if you take a step back and look
$C: I think it explains a lot tbh. Its basically conditioning to associate opposing views with laughable absurdity. And its very effective. Gives you that feeling of superiority, "you're smarter than THESE idiots". I remember watching as an impressionable teenager and Daily show/colbert report gave that vibe.

$C: Just to be clear, if you think using anonymous sources is proof of propaganda and fake news, or is even remotely comparable to what's happening in the original video OP shared, you have a poor understanding of journalism. I don't think you're being sincere, I think you're pushing an agenda.
$C: Fox is worthless. So they might lean more right. What about CNN and MSNBC and ABC and CBS and PBS and NBC?  One network out of the rest that leans right means the media as a whole is right wing?  Damn dude. 
$C: Examples of monopolies in general?

lol, no you didn't. You asked for examples of monopolies that didn't use the government in some way.  My point was that all monopolies, eventually, lean on government but they don't all start through government.

I'm asking you to define a natural monopoly because based on everything you've said so far you aren't talking about what economists call a natural monopoly.  Considering utilities are natural monopolies and heavily regulated by local governments you are not using the term properly.
$C: Are you Dwight Schrute?

So to answer your question more specifically: Refer to how courts work. 
$C: Obviously there are national news outlets. We in the US value our local news outlets because they used to give a local perspective and were not beholden to national political interests. Now you have one company quietly buying up all the local stations and controlling the content in order to use people's trust in local news to astroturf their worldview.

$C: I’m well aware of what a representative democracy is, and it’s a far superior system to direct democracy. If we had direct democracy idiots like you would have direct say in public policy, and that’s frankly horrifying.

Good use of rhetoric by the way referring to your preferred democratic system as “true” democracy to make any opposing viewpoint “false” in comparison. That’s the problem with idiots, some of them are good at arguing. 

But here I am breaking my promise. You are an incredibly immature person no mater how old you are, and you have an astoundingly simplistic world view. 

Keep railing against a group of imagined bad guys because it makes you more comfortable than the chaos of reality, that sometimes bad things happen because people don’t know what to do and not because some big evil cadre is running the country into oblivion even when that would obviously hurt their own interests.

The FBI didn’t follow up on the tips, the Sheriff’s Department didn’t do anything about being dispatched to the shooter’s house 39 times and still allowed him to buy a gun, then the sickest part was that the school resource officer didn’t perform in his time of real need. This isn’t a gun problem, it’s a law enforcement and people problem. It’s been conveniently diverted to be about guns but the truth is that the FBI and the Broward County Sheriff’s Department needs to answer as to why they did nothing to stop this. The school resource officer in Maryland did what the one in Florida was too weak and scared to do, defend the school, and they need to answer for that.

I've had the opposite experience, but point well taken. It's a shame we are so quick to knee jerk against opposing views. Would be nice to get to a point where we can respectfully disagree with each other and still come away with a little bit more understanding of views we don't hold.

Have a great day /u/TheMostUnclean :)
$C: Real reporting almost certainly exists somewhere, and is definitely more valuable than ever. Wapo, nytimes, and npr are *not* examples of this, however. 
$C: They lie through omission, failing to cover the other side, or simply bring on "experts" who lie and are unopposed, and sometimes simply completely lying, if you're familiar with "GamerGate" they've noticed not even the ombudsman could hold them to account. You see this with most government media, from the bbc to the cbc, its all the same because they are all staffed by the same monoculture at this point, they talk a good game about "diversity" when they have none at all. 

These methods of selective concern for the facts is also how these "fact check" sites work. We should have long learned that the only way to keep the media even slightly honest is to record everything, yet even that doesn't completely work because they know the bigger platform can spread lies further. We are at the point where the recommendation is that one should only speak to a journalist through a live stream, so there is an uninterrupted, unedited record of what actually was said at the time, and most journalists will refuse such a condition because of this. [One example for this, whether you love him or hate him, Milo Yiannopoulos did an interview with NPR in which they later refuses to broadcast it, because it didn't fit their narrative.](https://youtu.be/kmQe1tWVBk8)

NPR is responsible for a lot of damage, simply look at the 1 in 5 campus rape myth and the ensuing hysteria, resulting in Obama's policies which led to kangaroo courts leading to walking disasters like the Columbia Mattress Girl. Also, did you know NPR was responsible for pushing that original bogus study to prominence, even when it became clear that the originating case for the study was itself a false accusation? https://archive.is/VOU71

https://youtu.be/qMR5GyuZF0o

The case of Laura Dunn, false accuser, its turtles all the way down, yet NPR never corrected the record, and now we are at "yes means yes" laws.

Edit: let me know if you want more examples.
$C: It's hard for people to get over the yes/no black /white, us us vs them mentality. Especially when this idea that providing both sides of an argument is the only way to be non partial &  "fair and balanced".

 This only pushes the narrative and frames every discussion as an argument of wills. When an opposing and equally credible point does not exist, then news companies must find one..... thus leading to false equivalence. 
$C: Those on the left love to believe in their sophistication, but NPR is just straight propaganda.

https://www.wnyc.org/story/129437-pulling-back-the-curtain/?tab=transcript

These techniques are tried and true, NPR delivers its lies in a calm measured manner, the pauses and incongruities of speech are edited out to create an air of authority. [It becomes rather more blatant when they selectively stop applying this method to make a conservative sound stupid in comparison.](https://imgur.com/a/bsWfg) Perhaps this is one of the reasons why half of the country is so triggered over Trump, they have been trained to associate truth with manner of delivery when its very far from how things really are.

First of all : where did I say that Trump _literally_ said that neo-nazy were good people? I was talking about this comment from the beginning as anyone with two brain cell will understand that nobody that does not share white supremacist views will join a literal white supremacist rally. I personally believe that every body in that rally is a neo-nazy sympathizer for the simple fact that they willingly associated themselves to that group.    
Second of all : Asking for a verbatim quote stating the obvious is, again, a really lazy rebuttal. Would you also need a verbatim quote stating "I am racist" to believe that Trump holds racist views?

$C: And I’m on iPhone 6s Plus so i guess that’s even more impressive?
$C: r/politics is hardly radical left wing. Its by most political standards quite conservative.
$C: Segment producers.

Sometimes they send reporters out to get some interviews and some footage, but all the research, writing, editing and such is done by the producers.

News anchors and reporters are not the ones doing the writing.  They're just the faces on the screen.

Edit--
I should add the caveat that there are probably segments produced by reporters or news anchors.
$C: They have to write some local puff pieces to gain your trust
$C: You make a fair point. I can only hope they rise above all this noise and can return integrity to the industry.
$C:  Your rebuttal is essentially "nuh uh!" Lol.

Let's do this in crayon, might that help?

Fact: Sinclair is a right wing media conglomerate.

Fact: Sinclair has been buying local TV news stations across the country.

Fact: They provide these stations "must run" segments, like the one in the video.

Which one of these is inaccurate?
$C: Damn, I’m sorry man....embarrassingly enough I forget. Been hardcore redditing for a couple hours here, so I’m a bit twisted.
$C: Typical keyboard warrior loser. Did Mommy not get you your favorite snacks today so you had to  get tuff on the interwebs?

If you actually passed high school and had the reading comprehension of a freshman you would have realized I never blamed anything on Obama you fucking idiot. 

After looking at your post history it's abundantly clear urine entitled little spoiled bitch.
$C: Hey, I liked him. But when you get this far down a thread, people from /r/The_Donald start coming out of the woodworks and do some amazing mental gymnastics to make it seem like liberals are the ones controlling the media or some shit. Like, did they not watch the video about a single company, Sinclair broadcasting, that set out to create a "conservative megaphone" and succeeded? It's fucking terrifying how well it's working!
$C: Funny I'm an American and I think both sides. Because of my experience showing both sides are utter shit at keeping their word
$C: The democrats are less terrible because they will allow decent things to happen, but they're obviously infiltrated as well. Hillary is a fucking terrible human being, and the bullshit that went on at the primaries was all that should be required for people to boycott that party entirely. They dont want to win for the people - if they did they wouldnt have sabotaged Sanders like they did. 

Your democracy is fucked. Its happening in every western country, the people are being slowly screwed - the republicans are just doing it faster than the democrats.
$C: I'm not disagreeing with your main points at all but I think there is a serious issue with the general public's understanding of foreign policy. Most people are idealistic in their foreign policy views rather than realistic. It isn't easy for the average person to understand why strategic partners are important for relative global stability, or even why global stability is something they should care about. People have a tendency to see the world through their own moral lens, which is not exactly going to be an accurate worldview. The world is incredibly interconnected, and it's really hard to see that for the average person in the US. This leads to people having really short-sighted views on foreign affairs that boil down to black and white talking points. 
$C: >What has Trump done to suggest he is a warmonger ? 

[Trump has asked for and got a huge increase in military spending](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-signs-700-billion-military-budget-into-law)

[Trump increased the number of troops in Afghanistan](http://www.newsweek.com/trumps-afghanistan-troop-surge-complete-raising-total-number-us-servicemen-714588)

[Trump has resumed bombing the Taliban in Afghanistan](http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/03/26/the-drones-are-back/)

[Trump has escalated bombing campaigns in Somalia](https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/8xmmkv/trump-is-poised-to-bomb-somalia-more-in-his-first-year-than-obama-did-in-eight)

[Trump has been dropping more bombs on the middle east than his predecessor](http://www.newsweek.com/trump-era-record-number-bombs-dropped-middle-east-667505)

So if you call Obama a warmonger - then Trump is much more of one.
$C: I thnk /u/Rottimer 's response sums it up nicely, but yea even though his campaign rhetoric was isolationist, he has not followed up with that at ALL. 

In every aspect of the middle east beyond Syria, where the U.S backed rebels have irrecoverably lost, trump has ratcheted up tensions and increased bombing and troop levels. The main reason is that he doesn't actually have any of his own ideas on what to do, so has been allowing the pentagon to make the strategic decisions while hamstringing diplomatic alternatives through Tillerson's garbage state dpt. 

Tillerson is out now, but the guy who is replacing him, Bolton, is one of the few people who still thinks the Iraq war was a good idea, and is generally considered a reckless hawk
$C: Trump has been threatening attacks on North Korea.
$C: No news is unbiased. Just choosing what to report inserts an inherent bias into news. You need to have critical thinking skills to discern the truth. I could make a newspaper where i report 100% facts but if it was 90% stories about cops killing people, it would be biased. This is the game far right media tends to play but cherry picking small stories from around the world where muslims, feminists, and other groups they don't like do something extreme. This makes people think it is more common than it really is. Take antifa for example. They have been proven to be a very small percentage of protestors in literally every protest they've been to. And the number of assaults they commit in most protests is smaller than the number of assaults at your average football game or music festival. But if you watch fox news you would think that 50% of left-wing protestors are black-clad thugs planning on enacting a communist coup. 
$C: Journalistic integrity isn’t a matter of viewpoint.  Reporting on mass protests due to a violent school shooting isn’t “trotting our children to promote an agenda.”  Ignoring/suppressing that news or attacking those children for expressing their opinion (also an endowed right) would be the definition of promoting an agenda.
$C: try not to blow all your money on tin foil hats 
$C: Again. The world isn't black and white. Not every cop is involved in a "murder cover up". 

And tell your husband I'm sorry. 
$C: Need that last word, huh?
$C: Refute the claim tho
$C: This comment chain made me dumber.  I don't think your question is worthy of downvotes, and it has yet to actually be answered.  
$C: "I have no rebuttal so I'm going to tap out, rather than seriously engage with ideas that don't align with my extremely narrow worldview."  

Stay comfy in that bubble, my dude.  


$C: [deleted]
$C: You're way out of the loop. It turns out Danish intelligence had already hacked into the Russian intelligence operatives and literally watched them on webcams while the Russians hacked the DNC. Mueller has filed indictments specifically naming the individual Russian hackers because the FBI knows exactly who did it. 

That's just one piece of evidence. People on /r/politics often post timelines with 20 sources or more going into the Putin/Trump connection. I know that subreddit can be obnoxious, but there are some super knowledgeable people there too. 
$C: That is patently false. When you make statements like this, you might as well be a Putin troll. The effect is the same. 
$C: [Bias, huh?](https://www.yahoo.com/news/blogs/ticket/conservative-activist-green-name-gets-irs-stamp-approval-193457897.html)

The problem with your cited source is that they compare it to violent crime **in total** if you read closely. Not even gun crime. 
$C: Glad to know I have your support.  Thanks for legitimizing my position, cheers.
$C: What do you mean by respect? What about that do you deeply admire?  That someone could adhere to a belief when mountains of solid evidence prove the contrary?  It's not even a matter of faith, like believing in God.  Its demonstrably false.  Assuming it's an adult holding the belief the world is flat, it is intellectually dishonest to respect that view or that person as a rational being.  Don't be contrarian for the sake of being contrarian.
$C: I see what you mean. I agree.
$C: That explains the war in Afghanistan not in Iraq. The recession began in 2008, before Obama had taken office, it was Bush’s handling of the wars that led to it. 
$C: Maybe...just maybe their bitching has merit?
$C: Since you just Google searched and didn't even put up a link.  Those are for Obama's last 10 months compared to trump.  That proves nothing.  So no not a source. Lazy.
$C: Yes, that’s what a reputable news source says until the story is proven to be true. And keep reading you moron, it covers multiple cases of his infidelity. His divorce from Ivana was because of his philandering. 
$C: Your sources are absolute garbage. The second one is from The Globe, a supermarket tabloid. You’re a fool if those are where you get your news. 
$C: Lmao 

“You’re quite aggressive...” 

*says the guy who leads off with “fucking retard” completely unironically*

Again...

Lmaooooooo

$C: no thanks. I'm not a bot
$C: Yet u still won't prove anything I've said was wrong. So really, u think u win this argument by being a snob?
$C: seems like ive "triggered" you, you sure shut the fuck up quickly
$C: "Hush money" is standard operating procedure in business and politics. It's a legal agreement between two people. Politicians on both sides constantly have little sex scandals that they use tax payer money to keep quiet. Sorry for the haters but Trump is sparkling clean. You can't be in the public eye making so many enemies and drawing the attention of very powerful people and be significantly dirty. And with this Mueller investigation? They don't have shit, and if they had even a misdemeanor they would have leaked it by now. He might be the cleanest person in all of Washington. 
$C: Yeah, and remember what a big deal that was?  Republicans had a field day with that. It was all people talked about. Resignation was a big possibility. Twenty years later some of those same republicans voted for the pussy grabber. Keep laughing chuckle head. And keep bringing up Clinton. Very topical. 
$C: >"That isn't all they report on and you know it. I'm not saying they are packing some hard hitting shit every other day but **they aren't nearly as bad as you are depicting.**"


>I used a specific example of how they behaved on that interview and other coverage and asked you if you had even seen it, specifically the interview.

Yes. While ignoring thier other reports and acting as if this story is the epitome of what they do.

 >I'm specifically and only referencing their reporting on Stormy and how much of a shameless ratings grab it is, so that's all I could assume you were referring to. Did I say that's all they report on? No, I'm saying since that "story" broke, the majority of their breaking news and discussion with numerous anchors/pundits was this Stormy bullshit. Funnily enough they were duped by her lawyer into thinking there was a recording of some big thing and it turned out there wasn't shit.

Wait. Did he release what was on that DVD yet? It doesn't make sense that you would assume all I was referring to is this story because I very clearly stated otherwise.



> It's been that over and over since the election, a big build up saying Trump will be impeached any day now, and every time, it's a dud, they have nothing, it's all manufactured hope for your side. 

You are making this up. They do not imply that, much less imply it constantly. You are the exact thing you claim to hate. Spewing bullshit that isn't true.


>They are so enveloped in taking Trump down with some big story that it's consumed them and they don't even realize it. 

Except for the few times that they have actually praised him for things. Again, you are making this all up.

>The people that watch it and believe it are the same way, deluded and consumed with Trump derangement syndrome. 


I watch it pretty much 24/7 as I hate to not have background noise because it screws with my ADD. This is how I know that you're making all of this up. Not to mention your assumption about me is entirely Incorrect and I am currently proving you wrong about your assumption on who views them.

>And you all just keep feeding off each other, going further and further into this downward spiral of rejecting the reality around you. And those of us that don't buy into the propaganda bs the MSM feeds us daily, are living happy lives because we see the reality of our country growing stronger.

This is an immense amount of projection you are making.


> For ALL Americans. 

I'm sorry, was there somebody that was being excluded? What the hell are you talking about?

$C: Pretty much every local news channel in the US has their own YouTube channels where they upload newscasts like this. An easy way to get multiple versions from the different stations would be to go to Sinclair's  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stations_owned_or_operated_by_Sinclair_Broadcast_Group#current_television_stations) page and look up specific stations' YouTube accounts. 
$C: >Can you get every local news cast on YouTube or something

All Sinclair stations webcast.  Would be fairly trivial to record those streams somewhere and search the closed captioning to find these segments.
$C: I stay away from cancer. 
$C: The world would fall into ruin by everyone being pathological liars and objective truth no longer being valued.

His White House is already a dumpster fire with the highest turnover rate in history, so it's not hard to see how that would have a detrimental impact on the world at large.
$C: Roblox I think is big now
$C: Here is a link the article you pulled that quote from. I would like to point your attention to two things: to the very first goddamn sentence and the fact that THIS IS NOT THE WASHINGTON POST.

https://www.google.com/amp/www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/us-politics/sd-me-trump-daca-20180401-story,amp.html

“President Trump said Sunday that there would be no deal to legalize the status of millions of “dreamers,” undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, stating that the U.S. border with Mexico was “getting more dangerous” and directing congressional Republicans to pass tough new anti-immigration legislation.”

Literally the first sentence they define what a dreamer is, and they do not make any attempt to hide the word “undocumented.” 

Honestly not even a good attempt. You can do better than that hopefully. 
$C: I appreciate you not being an asshat and insulting my profession. Happens way too often on here. Cheers
$C: Your statement that CNN has never intentionally lied in their almost **40-year run** is pretty bold.. especially after being presented with a lie for which they drew mainstream criticism.

but ok
$C: Hmm, cutting quotes to fit a headline...sounds very CNN like.  Also just going to throw in the coincidence (we’ll call it a coincidence for shits and giggles) that CNN was owned by Ted Turner...an admirer of Fidel Castro saying Fidel was “one hell of a guy” and a self-proclaimed “socialist at heart”.  So yeah I doubt CNN has any agenda to push. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: No, no it doesn't
$C: Right, "who gives a shit" about a monopoly on communications.  

You're right, there's nothing wrong with that and I'm sure you would hold exactly the same position if it were a company preaching about 73 genders and wanting to abolish the Second Amendment.
$C: Please tell me what I did wrong in your eyes. Or do you simply not understand the difference between ''your'' and ''you're''?



You're being very vague about what is wrong in your opinion.
$C: Oh a classic, pretending someone edited their comment. Great dude, real mature.

>''Standing on a pedastal of wisdom when you yourself bring nothing to the table but misguided attacks on my character.''


Does *anyone* actually talk like that? Really the best you could come up with, huh? 



Please seriously explain to me what makes you believe others to be 'sheep' and why you think your worldview is correct, but don't humiliate yourself with cheap tricks.
$C: Ah, you've edited your comment to be readable, I understand now. Read your first comment carefully, you said  ''if that dam breaks your left with nothing'' that's terrible grammar, it should be ''you're'' or ''you are''


>my arguement is that you hold onto your ideological beleifs so tight, that it has basically become your identity, and any evidence that goes against your new found identity you dismiss it, without good reason

First of it is: ''argument'' and ''beliefs'', but errors aside, that is no argument at all. That can be said of anyone if you don't back it up by *at least* an example.


>Look at what your doing right now,


Dude, are you kidding me? *you're



>Standing on a pedastal of wisdom


*Pedestal.


>Is calling me insecure any different from me calling you a sheep.


Yes, as you assume an air of absolute arrogance whilst being unable to differentiate between you're and your. I call you insecure *because* you call people sheep, I have a tangible reason to assume you are. Calling everyone who disagrees with you a sheep is no comparable.


>I sure do pitty the sheep.


*pity. The second time you spell it wrong. 



I agree with you that some people are stuck in a certain viewpoint, yet you assume *anyone* who disagrees with you must be because you *must be* right, so they are wrong. Being unable to comprehend different viewpoints speaks of great ignorance.
$C: One minute for each victim, in support of an event titled 'National Day of Action Against Gun Violence in Schools.'

Edit: I agree that a handful of companies owning most mainstream media is a problem, though. It's the result of Republican deregulation policies via the FCC, FWIW.
$C: you know what man youre aight in my books
$C: Yes, this is generally how t_d posters operate. Hence why we can see you constantly repeat the same disproven talking point in this thread and whenever you get called out you just ignore it and repeat it elsewhere conviently forgetting that you got called out for being wrong previously.

Must be confusing to you why mods are not deleting opposing voices.
$C: Oh wow you got me, nazi.
$C: > I’m aware most of the media has a left wing bias.

>You only read what you wanna read huh?

Yeah, you’re fucking retarded bud. 
$C: >they don't all start through government

Name some that started not through government and stayed monopolies without government. If you think this doesn't happen, then you've validated my claims, that monopolies persist because of government. 
$C: Or maybe because “anyone I don’t agree with is a nazi”, you dumbass.
$C: woa
$C: Cheap advertising. A cheap whore for cheap advertising. Gotta keep that information sphere under control.
$C: Finland, the country with the highest press freedom has a public news organization called Yle. Its director is elected by a governing body made up of 21 members of parliament. It's a poltician run organization.
$C: That's your best move, guy who "learns from academics"? To jump to calling people who disagree with you idiots? 

Enjoy the status quo and your parents' money.
$C: Why does the gap between the rich and poor in America grow steadily for 30+ years? That's not chaos - it's very predictable.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Sounds like a really big rug, if anything.
$C: Make your time.
$C: Sounds like a baby, and I hate babies...
$C: More than anything big bruh
$C: Freedom is the power or right to act, speak, or think as one wants without hindrance or restraint. People in North Korea aren't free, if they question their leader, they could die, or have their tongues cut off. 

Do you understand how the world works? Things don't pop into existence made specially for you, someone has to build your house, someone has to grow your food. How exactly do you expect the world to work if nobody works?
$C: The point is we work **way** more than what our fair share would be.
$C: Automated farm equipment exists, you know.  You don't even need a human in the tractor/plow/thresher/whatever anymore.  GPS and automated machinery can do it all.  One dude with an internet connection could control hundreds of them with ease to feed millions of people.

Automated farm, automated trucking, automated sorting/cleaning/packaging facilities, automated trucking from there to the store, self checkout, or even automated vehicles delivering your grocery order from a local warehouse that uses automated picking to get your order made up and out the door.

We have the technology, we just need to implement it on a wider scale.
$C: It was aimed at the staement that if you work for someone you are not free. Everyone jumped on me, I really wasn't trying to be rude. I just know that is an sentiment that dies with age and i was curious of the posters age. I didn't mean to cause a stir.
$C: Reported policy moves on the NYT vs. White House talking points...

I guess we need to trust the White House! The NYT is fake news! Wait, are you not a Trump supporter?
$C: And quite obviously, Obama fought with and bargained with the Republican leadership to get picks who supported net neutrality...

And he called upon the American people to ask the Republicans to pick pro-net-neutrality individuals

He also went to full effort to get the Democrats in the Senate to fight against Pai

Actually, he did absolutely none of those things and laid down his sword just like the Republicans did for him with the SC Justice. He didn't even fucking try.
$C: So someone is a shill if they're a democrat that doesn't like russia.

>CTR

Ah. A trump conspiritard. Now it makes sense.
$C: CTR does not even exist anymore. Jesus H Christ..
$C: Their comment has just as much proof one way or another as yours does. 
$C: Fuck.
$C: Dis bad
$C: The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed.
$C: Omg this made me laugh way too much. I would give gold but I’m a cheap MOFO.
$C: Jesse Pinkman, is that you?
$C: I bless the rains down in Africa
$C: This danger is exceeding our democracy.
$C: The only idiotic responses I see are yours. The democratic party has been more about the american people than corporations in this current administration.  While it is stupid to assume that one party will save this whiplash crazy ride, it's not idiotic to hope, that while on party is submerged in corruption and party before country the other can grow a backbone and do something about it. 

By accusing people of being snowflakes that got "triggered", marxists and"quiet the adults are talking" you're either a painfully idiotic trump supporter, or you're just an idiot. 

I mean, how dumb do you have to be to troll your fellow americans, who have different opinions vs the rich fuckers who blame everyone else for the problems we are facing, and instead of fixing them, hold the solution as hostages so they can get something in return for helping the american people. How fucking pathetic are you?
$C: You’re calling people snowflakes and claiming triggered non ironically. Just about all I need to know to not talk to you. If you wanna claim to be one of the adults talking, maybe try and act like one.
$C: What a pussy. Thanks for the baseless opinion backed up by nothing. You "don't feel the need"? Basically you think you're better than proving your bullshit or you can't prove your bullshit. Pathetic. 

"I'm just gonna talk out my ass and then be stern about it. Yeah, that'll work..."

Wait, just realized I didn't sprinkle in enough buzzwords. Cuck. Cleetus. Redneck. Sister fucker. Cultist. Trumptard. Nazi. 
$C: “You don’t feel the need”. Is that the new I’m to stupid to back my statements. Go ahead run along now. The grownups are speaking.  Lol 😂 
$C: It's kinda insane that you think neutral sources are left leaning and insane propaganda fake news sources are fair and balanced
$C: Oh look who when confronted, tucks tail and runs. 😂 
$C: Says the loyal parrot of the guy entangled with Russian connections and seemingly subservient to Putin. “FAKE NEWS! POLLY WANTS A CRACKER! LEFTISTS EVERYWHERE! SQUAWK”
$C: That's what I thought. 
$C: So no source then? 

Your talking points amount to nothing, “common sense” or “just knowing” aren’t sources, especially coming from someone as biased as you.

Do I have some problems with the formatting of his show? Sure, but those are more or less issues stemming from HBO and not Oliver himself. 

Also, I don’t want to hear a word about the left and their echo chambers when the right is essentially a cult of trump at the moment 
$C: Oh. Absolutely, fuck you. Pretty fucking rich calling me out for reading comprehension in the same sentence you said, according to your own definition:

'from after before x'

You said this had been going on for years. "This" in this case being a national company buying up an illegal amount of local news stations and forcing them to say what they want them to.

But that's been happening since before television was invented according to you. Fuck off. You're worthless to talk to.
$C: And I’m Eric!
$C: THIS...IS...SPARTAAAA!!!
$C: I've got a bag of Milky Ways.
$C: Yep
$C: I don't like democracy. It's coarse and irritating and it gets everywhere.
$C: Now this is extremely dangerous to our democracy 


$C: REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
$C: Get rekt Gul du Cunt
$C: I found what I came here for. 
$C: And then started killing cops and fleeing to Cuba...

Not to mention that as a marxist-leninist organization they were fundamentally in favor of violence whether or not you're comfortable with admitting that.
$C: You're talking about the Rodney king riots, and in this case the targets of anger were the police, who's job it is to protect people property. 

Do you understand how revolting against a government and being angry about police brutality are different? You can't equate all riots as the same.

Don't be so close minded against people taking  actual action.
$C: That reference was not obscure at all. Anyone who has ever read 1984 and truly processed it would get that reference immediately. 
$C: No but you think you'll end the violence, it'll get worse and you will help to fuel it and claim yourself the victim, all while proving yourself a sociopath. 
$C: I’m 50/50 on that. I do agree and believe that a lot of people voted for him because he was something different as kind of a “fuck you” to the federal government, but I further believe that the Fox News/GOP propaganda wing pushed this right wing rhetoric for so long that the only possible candidate to win anymore was someone like Trump.
$C: That's a fair point, but you can't not offer every citizen adequate health care in a developed nation and at the same time have a 1:1 ratio of guns to citizens. If the problem is mental health then maybe the right should start focusing on helping the American citizens instead of letting them be murdered by psychos. Look something's gotta give, we need to try something and stop using the excuse that "I need the 2nd amendment to defend against tyranny". It's foolish because we literally are being taxed without representation (at least the majority of Americans are).
$C: Why is it always left and right when it comes to American politics? Why are we forced to meld into one of the two stereotypes? The real world is not black and white and real people are not left or right.
$C: Because we're talking the 2nd amendment, genius. Doesn't matter if it's too 10 or 100, doesn't change my point. Lol. I like how you pick out the thing that triggers you and ignore the rest of the context.
$C: Lol but you're just straight up wrong, republicans are the smallest party in the country, independents are the largest and I only brought up the election because you said there was more of you than us and that's factually false. I'm not MORE entitled to my opinion but that's how knowledge works, the more you know about something, the more educated your opinion will be on said topic. Also some things are just facts and you can't deny it when there's countless evidence to back it up. What bias sources am I following, how would you know? Everyone is ignorant, of course and republicans won't maintain power lmao, 36+ house members are retiring and or not running in 2018 because they know they are done. 

You're ignorance shows much more than mine though if you think after 2018 it's gonna be majority red lol. You ain't paying attention in the slightest. Great picks though, you guys got child molestors, Evangelical hypocrites, a rapist, so on and so on. Some great people!
$C: Who says I do? Lol you research bills and legislation being passed and written? Please enlighten me to the bills that have improved your life from your precious "conservatives".
$C: No I'm not lol, I've formed my own opinion based on facts, science and #s, but triablism because I love trump. I don't give a fuck if someone is republican, Democrat, independent, makes no difference. What matters is the truth and the fact you think Russia still had nothing to do with 2016 truly shows how willing you are to turn a blind eye. You would've wanted Obama impeached day one if he said "grab em by the pussy" but trump gets a pass because? You would've wanted Obama impeached if he brought the national debt to 20 trillion, but trump? No problem! I'm no where close to be a typical liberal sheep because I don't agree with all liberal values, but it seems like you're a blanket republican, as long as your side wins it's fine, even if they rape children, so classy, #maga.
$C: Not generalizing, you're doing exactly as I said you are lmao. My mind has been changed, I've admitted fault too many times to count, I'd love to see a right winger do that though. Ironic how you just said generalizing is a sign of a simple mind and then you generalize lmao. Nice one! Also it's hilarious how hard you're trying to insult me by constantly saying "simple mind" over and over yet you completely miss the irony of how simple it makes you seem lmao.
$C: [deleted]
$C: You're ascribing motivations to them which you have no evidence for. Also I somehow doubt they're lobbying to the tune of billions of dollars.
$C: lol at you getting your panties in a wad when I provide proof. This is the era of the i don't need a retort you are just a whataboutist


I could literally defend my point by saying that this is not the fist time x thing has happened and somehow it's whataboutism. You people man.
$C: > Would be nice to get to a point where we can respectfully disagree with each other...

I was a little young but before the internet, when most philosophical conversations were face to face, I think it was less of a problem. Humans will always butt heads but I don’t remember things being as polarized as they are now.   

But it does feel nice to come to an understanding with someone online. Probably because it’s so rare.

You have a great day as well. 


$C: lol what, thats fucking asinine, what is your shining example of "real reporting"? 
$C: What are some of those examples you would suggest then? Those are the sites I follow and generally trust, with a bit of salt
$C: Oh man, dude.. Go and read some pieces, just the quality of the language should tell you who has the broader journalistic ambitions. 
$C: You're absolutely delusional.
$C: Are you seriously using Milo to prove your point? Even if you happened to agree with all of his ridiculous opinions, he's an enormous asshole. Watch him on Bill Maher. All he does is call the other guests idiots. I'm not surprised his interview wasn't posted.
$C: This guy gets it. Thank you.
$C: Oh man I was all ready to pull back the curtain on Oz and see how NPR has been betraying the trust of it's listeners but this is it? They edit out "um"s and stutters? You have to have something 1000x better than that to call it straight propaganda.
$C: Ya know what? I actually listened to those and, can you believe it, they removed the 'um's from a conservative Christian too. Looks like you've got the narrative issue, not NPR.
$C: I think half of your country is triggered by Trump because he's a tax evading, cheating, bigotted piece of trash and also president. 
$C: Yeah what are you talking about? They edit their content to maintain a level of of professionalism. They probably don't edit other people's speech because its academically dishonest to alter the content. I don't listen to NPR because they are sooooo smart and suave and I wanted to bathe in their superiority. 

There was one millisecond "um" in that whole speach. The other girl's "likes" were heavily embedded in her phrasing and it would have sounded awkward if said directly without the likes. 


$C: Half of the country is so triggered over Trump because he's a racist, tax-evading piece of trash who's bragged about sexual assault and cares more about what people say about his hands than about the state of the country. The reason I respect NPR is because, whenever they talk about a partisan issue, they get both sides of the story. They interview Democrats, Republicans, and everyone in between. During the 2016 election, they talked to Hillary supporters and Trump supporters alike. At no point did they mock a single one or present one side more than the other. They got everyone's opinion. When they interview a politician, they ask tough questions. I've heard conservative politicians sound like idiots on their show. I've also heard liberal politicians sound like idiots. They dig deep regardless of the story and regardless of how it relates to one political side over the other.

To be clear, your reasoning for why NPR is secretly propaganda is probably the most bullshit conspiracy theory I've ever read. At no point did you provide evidence that they put a biased spin on anything. "They didn't edit out a brief pause in this conservative's speech." Take off your tinfoil hat, my dude.


It's alarming to think that you actually think NPR listeners are in a bubble. Are you genuinely comparing an independent, bipartisan radio show to the coordinated efforts of a company to indoctrinate conservative viewers through dozens upon dozens of local news shows? NPR doesn't put a spin on anything. They lay out the facts and let the viewers decide. If you listen to their coverage on a politician or policy and think they're trying to convince you that said politician or policy is flawed, than maybe that's a sign that it is, because all they give you is the information.

They have their leaders like anyone else. Just because they recruit like Muslim extremes to attack the litterati of the west, doesnt mean we should buy into their propaganda about brown soy boys who can't exist.
$C: [deleted]
$C: 1. This was likely a change of opinion by the author. Since it is only a headline, it is nearly impossible to tell from what you have presented.
2. The one on the right is labeled "Opinion" right at the top.
3. That's a random YouTuber posting her opinion on Twitter (stupid though, yes). Not really 'news'
4. This is clearly them making a joke in the email....
5. The Independent isn't a great source, I agree with that. However, it literally is saying "people are saying" not that "100% proof the election was rigged against Hillary."
6. Again, simply posting a headline comparison doesn't prove your point. One is likely talking about directly attacking voting machines vs. voter rolls and other things like that. One was also reported when it was thought that thing couldn't happen, and the other after it potentially did... so you know, like... a news development...
7. Same as 6
8. What's the 'fake news' here? One is reporting on a story with the information available, the other is an update on the story...
9. These are written almost a decade apart...
10. This isn't fake news? Clinton hadn't lost a billion dollars when she said (and you aren't attacking the reporting - you are trying to equate a quote by Clinton to a fact which is ironic with what she said)
11. So because there are 5 reasons to keep the electoral college means there can't be reasons to abolish it as well (and these are also 4 years apart)? This is AGAIN not an example of fake news but differing viewpoints.
12. An assessment of fashion is what you are going to use to prove fake news? LOL
13. These two tweets don't show anything about fake news.
14. Trump had asked Preet to stay before replacing him, so "ousting" is a correct term to use here. 
15. From the title, yes, this is silly. But I'm guessing this is an opinion piece, and likely makes more sense with context.
16. Random idiots on Twitter posting a quote about socialism is fake news? The biggest fake news in this screenshot is that this is NOT a Hitler quote: https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Gregor_Strasser
17. Yup, this is a bit silly. Though she is likely referring to 'going nuclear' in two different contexts here. No party had gone 'nuclear' over a Supreme Court seat before.
18. Bernie Sanders' opinion on the state of attacking the Assad regime is not fake news (but a change of his opinion even if it is hypocritical).
19. Trump attacking NK constantly on Twitter is different than sending an aircraft carrier to SK. Again, hard to comment on this when you are only supplying headlines.
20. Again, this is hard to verify is 'fake news' from the headline. It is entirely possible the travel policy (which could have been because of the second headline...) kept him out and then more information was found out about him. You need to be citing more than a headline in a screenshot.
21. The first is talking about Obama wiretapping the Oval Office on Trump and the second is the FBI getting a warrant for the Russia investigation... Not fake news on CNN's part (though it is on Trump's part for the Obama wiretapping comment) (and these are talking about different things)
22. "Opinion" and "opinion"
23. The second article is discussing a poll conducted which found Trump supporters are more judgmental about how people prefer their steak: https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-well-done-steak_us_56ec54bbe4b084c672203a4b. Not fake news.
24. WikiLeaks published that leak on October 7th, so this email was not public knowledge when the Tweet was posted on the 4th.


Okay, I think 24 was enough to prove my point that a bunch of random screenshots of headlines is a bad way to prove 'fake news' by news outlets.
$C: I didn't get a lot of 'lets work together' from your euphoric 'I'm better than all of you' post.

But just for the sake of argument, how do you work together with someone trying to cut your throat?
$C: Lol you comment in r/politics you communist cunt
$C: and there it is, the left imagining it's the middle once again. ignoring historical context just to condescend and pretend that when *we're* in charge it'll go so much better. after all, we're on the side of progress, diversity, tolerance, inclusivity, free shit, floof doggos, etc.

you want my obedience? come and fucking get it. meanwhile i'm in the world where there are more slaves alive today than there ever have been, i'm treated like a second class citizen by my institutions for polite disagreement, and i can think gay marriage is pointless while also being bisexual myself.
$C: Good god have you no shame you fucking spastic
$C: And here comes the back peddling - I could set a Swiss clock to you dumb fucks.

And if you didn’t feel the need to justify yourself - I wouldn’t be getting long walls of text - which by the way do not contain what I originally asked for.

I’m done with you. Peace
$C: Chicago is 53% by the Obama whitehouse: https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2012/05/23/turning-page-illiteracy
$C: I think it's a waste of money that will end up finding nothing you people claimed it would.

I'm betting it'll last 8 years and still find no proof.
$C: Producers write the majority of stories, but anchors write almost as much. It’s primarily reporters and photogs who go out doing the news gathering. And reporters write their own stories. Source: I’m an executive producer. 

Edit: also there are no “segment” producers in local tv markets. Newsrooms are too small nowadays so it’s most commonly one or two producers and both anchors writing the whole show (besides reporter stories, which reporters write). A tv newsroom isn’t like it was decades ago. 
$C: "Someone's house burned down, but it's not all bad, someone donated a car for them to sleep in. See, we don't need social security.  Let's see what the poors are up to.  Stealing benefits again of course. This new Trump tax cut is going to be amazing and everyone's going to get a unicorn. Back to you, Tom."
$C: As a tv news journalist, agreed. Fuck Sinclair. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: No worries. Mods out here deleting comments got me suspicious though 😳
$C: The fact you went through my post history shows how pathetic you are. You have nothing to say because I'm right and you know you're just spouting off bullshit. LOL. You're a real winner! I literally OWN people like you. Trailer trash. Go back to your janitor job and stop fucking your sister. It's making you super prickly 
$C: This is in part deliberate and manufactured. The average person in the United States see's the world through a certain lens, calibrated by the machinery of the state. Press conferences help steer the narrative the media is taking, along with Washington think-tanks, creating a general atmosphere of consensus on foreign policy within the American media. This misinforms and misleads the public, as they only digest one perspective on foreign policy. 

It's important to know that American think-tanks are heavily influenced by their donors, and are seen as leaders in regards to what direction American foreign policy should take. Journalists, who know no better (or possibly do), reference these organizations to craft their opinion-pieces. Newspaper and broadcasting organizations are also subject to the scruples of their shareholders, which plays an important factor in what stance their editors take. It's important to remember that the New York Times was one of the most prominent advocates for a war with Iraq in the lead up to the 2003 war, and it's a consequence of how information is disseminated and portrayed in the United States. You can see the same sort of dynamic with nations like Iran today. Whenever an event is reported in regards to Iran, there is no consideration of the Iranian perspective on how it may be important to their own interests to take the actions they have undertaken. Instead, they are cast as irrational and aggressive actors. It's beneficial for American interests to be supported by the public, by delivering them information that promotes a boiled-down and easy-to-understand perspective of international events with an American slant. 
$C: Bolton isn’t replacing Tillerson, Pompeo (former head of the CIA) is.  Bolton is replacing McMaster as the National Security Advisor.
$C: No shit. And yet everyone buys every single thing the media reports about Trump over and over... Hmmm? Critical thinking you say? oh but only those with a conservative initiative slant need to have critical thinking, right?

If you've ever talked about something stupid Trump did or said, you're a brainwashed fucking hypocrite. 
$C: Expressing an opinion is one thing, explicitly agreeing with a view with zero critical thought and without correcting incorrect information is also propagating an agenda. Clutching pearls over someone who criticizes someone who is speaking on a matter of national importance is also pushing an agenda. “Yes, you are 100% correct Mr Hogg, you are only trying to save lives and that is the only thing that matters and everyone who disagrees with you wants children to die ” that’s not journalism, that’s propaganda. 
$C: I won’t, that’s sound financial advise. 
$C: Yep. Were you hoping I’d stop calling you a low energy loser? Pretty par for the course for Trump and his supporters these days. He’s really getting his shit pushed in over Russia. Why doesn’t he fight back? Why do you want to run away?

$C: If "newspaper alleges" = "well known and documented" its no wonder leftists got surprised by the election of Donald Trump.

In another comment I reminded people that sources said that Obama was sucked off by a gay man in a limo while smoking crack cocaine. And I will by your own standard that this is how reputable news sources tell stories until they are proven true.


Get a grip
$C: The video originally posted by CNN then? 

Could you give me an example of a trustworthy source? 

We are in a comment section talking about media propaganda and following a script btw.

Why did media try to hide the shady stuff about Obama and then post anything what so ever about Trump that has no sources what so ever?

You dont get away from it. Media protects one side and try to crucify the other.
$C: I responded with that after reading the incoherent rant and being called a nazi for no reason. I lead my response with it but not the conversation. I doubt that person is actually mentally retarded but their inability to communicate properly certainly doesn’t help my impression. 
$C: Adults who own successful businesses sleep at night - they don't spend their evening hanging on the every word of a conspiracy loving anti-semite.

Wish there was a way to get through to you, but I fear you're too far down the rabbit hole. Keep on working against your own self-interests.
$C: Well, that’s pretty deluded.
$C: It's relevant though.  Is it not?  Feels similar to something that happened before except he actually got impeached.  I wouldn't expect most of you kids to remember that because you were babies or weren't even born yet.  
$C: LOL what are you doing on reddit?
$C: > The world would fall into ruin by everyone being pathological liars and objective truth no longer being valued.

I'm old enough to remember when republicans were the fear mongers.

> His White House is already a dumpster fire with the highest turnover rate in history, so it's not hard to see how that would have a detrimental impact on the world at large.

My man is result driven.  Either get it done or get the fuck out.  I've been in the corporate game for long enough to know that if you don't get it done, you're on your way out.

$C: Being mistaking and intetionally broadcasting lies like fox does are different things.

I can show you evidence of fox doing this, you cannot for these other orgs we are talking about.
$C: you mean the ones astroturfing for trump? cute
$C: Yes...it actually does.
$C: You take whatever is given to you that already fits with your ideological opinions. You dont even relize that those opinions aren't even your opinions just the opinions of another man who has an ideological way of thinking for people like you. A way of thinking you gladly digest  because it gives you an identity, something you couldnt create on your own. So when you see another opinion that doesnt fit with your ideological reality you dismiss it and call it yellow journalism yet you havent done any research on these subjects yet you stand their and honestly believe your opinion is worth something. Jesus christ dude.
$C: Ya i quess your right. I do have trouble seeing other peoples viewpoints. Its just hard to when people literally just say everything the tv or fb tells them to say. Alot of people dont think for themselves. In other words their sheep but their more lost thsn anyrhing. Not saying im found, but i realize arguing over dumb politics shit is useless unless we have the truth about the subject, testable data. People hold onto their ideological beliefs as if it was their religion.
$C: Well, propaganda-spewing ventriloquist redditor, you didn't make it very hard. 
$C: Such great debate skills numbnuts. Care to elaborate on saying the media is right wing when only one out of the rest is?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Bueller?

You can't just resort to name calling in a debate.  That's not how a debate works. 
$C: I can't tell if you are trolling or just obtuse.  I don't think you've understood a single thing I've said or have any grasp on basic economics.  You dodge every clarifying question I've asked.  There really isn't any reason to continue this conversation.
$C: NATIONALISM IS FASCISM, YOU FUCKING DOLT.
$C: Dude the sphere has been co-opted by CIA undercover Russian 9/11 planners to infuse our minds with secret Szechuan mind control sauce based on propaganda Nobel prizes. How did you not know that?! Did you misplace the tin foil hat again?
$C: Yeah again refer to how the courts work. 
$C: I’m not calling you an idiot because you disagree with me, I’m calling you an idiot because you’re horrible at making a case and you rely on emotion to convince people. Why should I spare your feelings from the truth? 

You’re the one who’s been using ad hominem attacks. I think you’ll find I actually attacked the substance of your points before I attacked you, all you did was attack me. Your best move was literally to make use of the most well known style of fallacious argument. This is why I call you an idiot. 
$C: Yeah, thinking we should have expert craft public policy instead of the average joe is totally me hating democracy. Direct democracy is such an incredibly flawed system, voters become extremely fatigued by having to constantly vote on laws, there’s no check on the tyranny of the majority, the average person doesn’t actually pay enough attention to economics/science/sociology to have any idea what policies would actually work, let alone the logistical impossibility of having such a system in a country as large and diverse as America, etc.
$C: Or maybe Democrats don’t do nearly as much shady shit as Republicans, for whatever reason. Just a thought. Occam’s Razor and all that.
$C: I see great financial freedom in your future
$C: Fucking babies and their future in front of them and how they will steal our jabs.
$C: If "Freedom is the power or right to act, speak, or think as one wants without hindrance or restraint", then I hate to break this to you, but we aren't free. And saying we are a thousand times won't make it true. 

Humanity will eventually have to stop worshiping currency and the Economy God, as it has gotten us to where we are now: a system of debt and wage enslavement, not to mention unimaginable ecocide that could have been easily prevented had we not insisted on propping up industry. 

I don't recall saying that nobody is going to work, or that things magically pop into existence. We are a resilient species that could easily create something much better and much more beneficial than our current systems, as our current ones do *not* serve the interests of the general public or the planet. Our society has an addiction to currency, and that problem can't be solved if we keep acting like we don't have a problem. 
$C: ...Have you ever stepped foot on a farm?
$C: We need to implement it? Who is *we* exactly?

Because the people that own these farms are the ones maintaining it, not us. They are the ones responsible for its upkeep and harvest. Are you going to require them to spend their hard-earned money to integrate automated equipment? That's just as unjust. 
$C: Takes people to design and produce those machines too. And people to design and make the factory that makes the machines. And people to design and make the tools to make that factory. And people to oversee that everything in that process is done safely.

And that's just food. We need electricity, water, household goods, and homes to survive. Plus not all food is grown in a field. And then we're still not factoring in the new technology and entertainment that people love. It's not as simple as you make it out to be. 
$C: We need to implement it? Who is *we* exactly?

Because the people that own these farms are the ones maintaining it, not us. They are the ones responsible for its upkeep and harvest. Are you going to require them to spend their hard-earned money to integrate automated equipment? That's equally unjust. 
$C: don't you mean it's accepted with age?
$C: Jumped on you?  lol I was the only reply bud!

But yea, looks like you couldnt take what you served.

This can still be a 'Teachable Moment' for you in where you learn that now that you are too old to make a difference, dont rod on the people who, weather foolishly or idealistically, try to make things better.
$C: I wouldn't expect someone whose #1 active reddit is /r/ShitLiberalsSay to have a functioning brain, but even this is amazing to see.

You weren't born early enough to remember the net neutrality debate or what happened? You really ought to read what people post instead of rushing to be the first to leave a snide uninformed reply.

You know what? I'm going to wait for someone less euphoric to reply to.
$C: Someones likely a shill if they repeat the same talking points in every thread they can and blame Russia for NRA donations.

> Ah. A trump conspiritard. Now it makes sense.

Despite me not making a single pro trump comment, ever. 

Odd how vigorously you're defending a shill...
$C: Does not mean shilling does not exist
$C: ... holy shit. So all it takes is someone calling anyone else a shill and you believe it. That's your standard.
$C: ...Dur....
$C: Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated.
$C: It was a joke, snowflake. Try not to get too TRIGGEREDED by it.
$C: Haha wow you got me lol have a nice day. Reddit, ladies and gentlemen. 
$C: Lol "neutral" you sound like my fox news watching grand parents. Fair and balanced, right?
$C: If you're dumb enough to think  neutral sources exist, you're too dumb to have this conversation.
$C: I support Trump now? When did that happen? I'm really devastated by this news. I hate it when I'm a loyal parrot! CURSE THOSE RUSSIAN BOTS!!! *shakes fist
$C: Ok.  
$C: It's not an illegal amount. It is legal because the FCC made it legal. 

And yeah it has been happening for a long time. Media companies have owned many outlets. Hearst owned many newspapers. Having worked at an ABC affiliate I can tell you ABC made us run stories on our local newscast. I've heard many stories of stations having to retract or do a follow up story in an effort to please sponsors who were upset that a story showed them in a bad light. Forcing propaganda, and the agendas of parent companies is nothing new. The scale on the otherhand IS something new. None of it is illegal, but that doesn't mean it isn't unethical. It has been happening before television in one way or another. To deny that is kind of silly and risks setting us back on doing something about it. 

But I can see you're not the understanding type. Just looking for confrontation even if it means arguing from pretty much the same position as mine. Have a good one. 
$C: I love lamp!
$C: It’s treason then...
$C: Show me a riot in American history that did not turn into wanton destruction of private property, or involve violence against bystanders by the rioters.

A riot, by very definition of what it is, is an undirected mob losing their fucking minds. It is *violent.*

Hell, for that matter, show me a single recorded riot *anywhere* that did not result in destruction of private property and violence against bystanders.
$C: Hmm, is that what happened after the revolutionary war? So I guess that war was bad for America. 

Continue the insults, just proves that you aren't willing to provide any sort of evidence to your claim. Just more assumptions.
$C: Those two ideas aren't logically connected... gun ownership and access to adequate health care aren't dependent on each other, so what's your point of juxtapositioning them? It's not like our government pays for people to have guns so there isn't enough money to spend on healthcare. 

No one is letting people get murdered by psychos. The sad truth is that if someone is really motivated to kill people then they are going to. Guns can certainly make it easier, and I would advocate for licensing akin to driver's license, adequate mental health screening etc but I'm not sure what that would do to stop someone getting a gun illegally. Truth is someone could go to school with a batch of poisoned brownies and kill just as many people. 


$C: [deleted]
$C: And I disagree with a lot of what Trump has done, but I can't stand the liberal hive mindset in America right now.
$C: What exactly does this have to do with incels? Are you projecting your own problems or something? There's literally nothing to tie to incels here.
$C: [Almost $1 Billion in 2016 _alone_](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/koch-brothers-network-will-spend-almost-1-billion-on-2016-election/), so yes, Billions. 
$C: *You people*.

Oh the fucking irony is strong.  Back to your Russian cave, begone!
$C: I wish I could give you one. These are certainly far from it, though.
$C: I don't have any. I wish I did.
$C: I hate moral relativists. The two sides of this coin are no where near equal. One side is clearly evil. And anyone who says it’s NPR/NYT/WaPo is a moron. I’ll grant that both sides have their faults, but c’mon, man, to say they’re equally bad is like saying an industrial accident that takes some dude’s pinky clean off is the same as an accident that rips the arm off from the elbow down. In this case, Sinclair wants to decapitate the dude when NPR/NYT/WaPo want to just trim his hair. And so fucking what if it’s a shitty ass haircut. 

Ain’t. The. Same.

$C: they're fuckin allowed to be here my dude. you have to let them play their game. you don't get rid of nazis by fighting nazis, you get rid of them by removing the anxieties that create nazis, and you can't do that with smugshit muh education coastal elitism. if you're not gonna know the enemy, you'll lose as much as you win every time.
$C: Speak of the devil.
$C: Rightfully so, I have made so many unsuccessful attempts at trying to bridge the divide between people that I'm a bit resentful of both sides and the shitty view each side has of the other.  
  
Both sides (On the citizen level) have the topics which they get emotional and unreasonable about, but if you can actually get people to stop and think about the issues, there are actually ways in which we might be able to have a single platform that is acceptable to people who identify with both sides. However, it seems the media and our politicians love to keep us divided and work towards that end. 
$C: Not particularly often, whereas you seem fairly committed to that cult.

There are also lots of Trump fans who post in /r/politics.  Something about them not banning anyone with a dissenting opinion.

Sweet meme though.  Anyone who isn't violently right-wing is a communist.  That's the spirit!
$C: When will you get it?  I don't give a shit if I'm left, center, or right.  I don't care what party you want to pigeonhole me into.  All I care about is *ideas*.  Ideas on how to move this country forward.  The GOP hasn't had one of those in decades.

I don't want your obedience.  You would be of little use to productive, compassionate people.  Just stay in your little red bubble and quit dragging everyone else down with you.
$C: Alright, we'll have to wait and see I suppose. Better to look and not find anything than not look and have there be something, right?
$C: Interesting.  I'll admit my knowledge of how local news works is dated and only second hand.

I wasn't aware anchors had so much discretion in what they cover.  I was always under the impression they just read a teleprompter.
$C: >Sinclair's stations have been known for featuring news content and programming that promote conservative political positions, and have been involved in various controversies surrounding politically-motivated programming decisions,[149][3] such as news coverage and specials during the lead-ups to elections that were in support of the Republican Party.[150][151][149]

$C: I hear ya man
$C: Lmao. More childish talk.

Once again. You misread my comment. It's simple. Deal with it. Learn to comprehend what you're reading better. It will make you smarter. Promise.
$C: I’m sure you can provide me with the media outlet that said “everyone who disagrees with you wants children to die.”

You’re argument was that all sides are propaganda.  Please find me the equivalent of Laura Ingraham in The NY Times, NBC, CBS, ABC, MSNBC, CNN, The Washington Post, NPR, PBS, etc., etc.
$C: You should read the news more:

$C: >Outdated editorial garbage from last November

Keep clinging
$C: > if i lash out while missing the point i'll feel superior
$C: See, you just contradicted yourself.  You can respect their right to be an idiot, but you cant respect the opinion itself.  That is where your intellectual dishonesty comes into play.
$C: How was that a deflection? Yes I am a dong chaser, I sit in the outfield at games with the intention of catching homerun balls. 
$C: The inherited economy is strong, but I’m not going to use that to turn a blind eye. Obama had his issues and even his most fervent supporters found them. 

Maybe grow a thicker skin about people criticizing. The right is always bitching too, everyone does. You are. Accept that people aren’t all going to love Trump the way you do and get the fuck over it. Enjoy life.
$C: [removed]
$C: You’re seeing what you want to see in that video. I’ve seen the video and it’s not at all how they describe it in the article. CNN didn’t hide anything with that video because there wasn’t anything to hide. There are no absolutely 100% unbiased sources but there are completely untrustworthy sources that only make stuff up. You seem to be good at finding those ones and gullible enough to believe them. 
$C: Bro idgaf tbh.

Really, anyone that uses the word retard as an insult, in 2018, is 1 of 2 things - 1) a big ole dummy or 2) a purposeful big ole dummy.

You should try and be more considerate of others’ feelings, regardless of what the guy up there (no clue who you’re talking about. I saw your comment randomly...hence why idgaf abt what happened b4) said to you.

None of that matters. Stop using the word retard. There’s just no need for it when there are a thousand other words out there. 

Shithead. That’s a good one. It’s fun to say and it’s a classic.

Go with shithead. Drop retard, faggot, etc. they’re stupid af over the age of 15 and serve no function than to further marginalize minority groups. 
$C: So your other reply to me has disappeared. I’m in mobile so maybe it’s the app.

Regardless, you don’t seem to get it. Context doesn’t matter. What some other person says to you doesn’t matter. 

*None of that matters* if you don’t have the intelligence and, frankly, class to NOT USE THE WORD RETARD.

This is very simple bro. It really is. That’s a word that I used when I was a fucking 13-year old who didn’t know shit about shit. It’s an archaic, stupid, hurtful word that serves no other purpose than to compare someone else who was born to a condition they literally have no control over. 

So, again, frankly, I don’t give a shit what your context is. You can choose from a thousand other words. Retard, faggot, pussy, etc....all of these words that have their origin in LITERALLY denigrating a minority class have no use in modern language.

It’s the fucking 21st century. Wake the fuck up. 

Jfc 
$C: Again, where's this antisemite bullshit come from that u keep saying?
$C: Well congress is choosing to ignore our historical norms, so apparently it is not relevant. I'm old enough to remember how good it was during the Clinton administration.  That really bugs you yeah?  Despite getting a bj most people liked Bill the Democrat. 
$C: It's the correct cancer......
$C: Calling Trump a pathological liar isn't fearmongering.  That's what he is.  That's what he's been his entire life.  This is extraordinarily well-documented.
$C: Regardless, still not biased writing. At all. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: And you assume these things based on what? Your own air of superiority? 



What make you *think* any of your opinions haven't been imprinted on you by your surroundings? People are always convinced they see things clearly, no matter how blind they are. I find that this is worse for those that are utterly convinced they know the truth, going so far as to call the others sheep; they are blindest of them all
$C: But you give no impression of any deeper thought than those you despise so much. Getting your information on different sources than those most used doesn't make said information correct automatically.


There are a lot of people that repeat what they hear without questioning it, and many of them believe themselves to be clearhead and well-informed, sometimes going so far as to call others sheep without realising how caught up in misinformation they might be themselves.



On top of that, work on your grammar if you want anyone to take you seriously. Your messages were riddled with errors, bad ones too, and you didn't even realise it. Your and you're are different.
$C: Hopefully it will make your trailer a little more cheerful during the holy week.

$C: Dude you’re arguing points I never fucking made. You don’t read, you just want to be right. I told you 4 comments ago most media is left leaning. What argument are you even trying to make? You sound dumb as shit. 
$C: >I don't think you've understood a single thing I've said or have any grasp on basic economics.

Pot calling the kettle black.

>You dodge every clarifying question I've asked.

Pot calling the kettle black.

Here is my original comment:

>The FCC granted the licenses. Monopolies only seem to happen and stick around when there's some gov't granted protection/licensure.

I don't give a flying fucking shit if they stay alive by buying the government. That only proves my point.
$C: Lmao, no. Fascism has nationalism, but you can have nationalism without fascism. Ask Napoleon, the USSR to an extent, the Germans in WW1. You sound like a bot. What will you say next?!
$C: April fools day jokes are great. Bless your heart 
$C: fascism is a 20th century political movement which sought to throw out old government, on the heels of ennui after 19th century materialism, and national depression (in both the personal and economic sense) after wwi. It was meant to recapture the glory of the "old" days, and was propagated by very bitter wwi veterans. It was anti conservative and anti liberal. It uses violence as a key motivator for political gains, bypassing democracy. Plenty of countries exhibited nationalist tendencies without being fascist. 

You know nothing about history. Nothing. At. All. Dunning Kruger up the wazoo  
$C: Nah we know about 9/11 -- it was mostly Israel. You wanna do this right here?
$C: Refer to how countries with restricted press freedom work.
$C: Check the tape, CUNT. you called me an idiot first, after all i did was ask if you were a libertarian in COLLEGE (half right), and that was after you said my source was invalid because it was a 10 year old video website (the most popular in the world).

you're an extremely privileged little twat and some day soon the poor are going to rise up and eat you and your cunty parents too :*
$C: I work less than 30 hours on average as a cashier and have saved up $3k this year.
$C: And they smell.  And they're loud.  And they're selfish and obnoxious.
$C: Currency has been used for thousands of years, because it's the easiest way of representing value. Do you suggest we abolish currency and go back to bartering? What exactly is your solution for this?
$C: Well I live in a rural part of the midwest, so I'm literally surrounded by them.
$C: *We* as as society.  The money is there, the technology is there, the need for a reformation of society from this late stage of capitalism to something more altruistic is there, but people don't like change and cling to any shitty system as long as its familiar.  In this case, still using human labor to work farms, transport, and warehousing/distribution as opposed to the automated version that could be implemented if our billionaire overlords and corporate slave drivers weren't eternally greedy.
$C: Dude spends his time on r/T_D, nuance isn't his forte
$C: Yes... you posted archived material from Obama "celebrating" net neutrality after his administration threatened to destroy it, forcing 4 million Americans to write in just to maintain the status quo.

BTW do you even know what ShitLiberalsSay is?
$C: > and blame Russia for NRA donations.

So people are shills because they believe things that actually happened? Way to combat the 'trump conspiritard' accusation by crying 'fake news' and calling anyone who disagrees with you a CTR shill.

At least pick a conspiracy theory that hasn't been debunked. CTR workers never pretended to be regular people. Hindsight proves your conspiritard fantasy was projection. That's what happened for trump. Been in the news.


$C: Thats...that's not at all what I said. Regardless, what does my opinion of the person I replied to have anything to do with anything? Did I comment and call them out as a shill? Did I disregard their points out of hand and call them "fake news"? The answer to both is no. So why does my thinking or not thinking of them as a shill mean anything?

As an aside, I've been meaning to ask what is this pump it paul ryan thing?
$C: Dur dook er derbs!

$C: Ya sure? Sure are committed to this joke 
$C: NPR, bbc, etc. 

Also, what are you, like 5? "Agree with me or you are dumb!" How about you support your points?
$C: > It's not an illegal amount. It is legal because the FCC made it legal. 

It was illegal until they had the law changed to satisfy them. It was illegal when they did it.

>And yeah it has been happening for a long time. 

Repeating yourself is not an argument. You said this has been happening since basically forever.  I described the situation. Show when it happened before or fuck the fuck off.

>But I can see you're not the understanding type.

I understand goalposts and dishonesty. I understand trying to play the ref by acting like the person you're talking to is unreasonable.

Argue the point or fuck off. I was out of patience for your bullshit two replies ago.
$C: Again, you harp on the word riot and ignore the word revolution. 

Let me ask this: did those riots have an impact? Did they cause change? Because I think history shows they did.
$C: Yeah, there's lots of ways to kill people, but guns are made to kill, nothing else and the ideas are connected, everything is. 

The same people calling for absolute and complete gun rights are the same people saying we don't want to provide adequate mental health care to American citizens. Okay so if you want to keep your murder machines then you gotta do something about the mental health issue, otherwise we're never gonna fix this.
$C: She really wasn't, ever heard the term soft power? Well we've lost a lot of it under trump, Hillary would've kept Obama's policies which lead us out of the recession while Trump's policies are leading towards that. Care to explain why the debt is 20trillion under trump when he promised to reduce it? You say she's a worse choice because she is a Democrat and possibly a woman, you don't have any actual data to back that up, but this isn't about Hillary, it's about the current party in power so stop pointing the finger. Also yeah almost all are corrupt, trump is no fuckin exception lol, if you think he is then god damn you got a serious case of blind trust.
$C: Also as a libertarian what are your ideologies then? Explain to me how anything has been improved since Trump won. Can you point out actual examples?
$C: I agree, I can't stand the hive mind set on either side, stop acting like it's just the left. 50% of alabamians voted for a pedophile, if that's not hive mindset idk wtf is. People support trump out of tribalism, that's obvious at this point, all they do is repeat what he says lol talk about forming your own opinion huh?
$C: [removed]
$C: Because the example given is cherry-picked and actually bullshit if you look into it. Ever wonder why t_d always uses screenshots, rather than linking to the actual story? Because if you zoom out, or look into it, you realize they're full of shit.

you can't win if you don't play, and being apathetic is the name of thame.
$C: > I'm a bit resentful of both sides and the shitty view each side has of the other. 

See, it's easy to pull 'both sides' when you talk entirely in abstract.

It's not both sides. Both sides didn't attack our democracy.
$C: > The GOP hasn't had one of those in decades.

"build a giant fuckoff wall" is a great idea and lots of people have done it to wonderful success.

>You would be of little use to productive, compassionate people. 

so compassionate you wanna tell other people what to do and call them morons when they don't scrape and bow. you do not know your enemy, you do not know yourself. you can go read sun tzu to see what happens when you do that. and if you wanna dispute that, remember you literally told me you don't know where you are on the spectrum. you're about as good as your word, you poor soul.
$C: Depends, how much damage do you want to cause the democrats?
$C: They often don’t get the credit they deserve because of people’s general perception that they’re just talking heads. I’m not vouching for every on-air journalist—some can be downright divas. But they do have a big hand in covering local stories, especially because they’re the ones viewers reach out to when they want something covered.

Seriously this false equivalence of these two news corps has got to stop. CNN corrects. CNN corroborates stories with other stations to ensure they are true. They fire bad journalists.

Fox on the other hand quite clearly shills for the Republican party, more specifically - Trump.

Watch Tucker Carlson for 5 minutes... Then listen to Jake Tapper - it's night and day in intelligence. It's night and day in honesty and integrity.

Come on dude you dont see the irony in this statement. 


$C: Half of those mistakes are me typing to fast on my phone, and i dont  re read my shit at certain times, and for some fucked up reason my autocorrect sometimes corrects my words with words that are still wrong. And i only come on here because i love to argue. I dont have the emergy to write every comment as if it was an essay because honestly i dont give a fuck, i just love the back and forth, it can be amussing to see how seriously people take this. 
$C: And presumptive too? Lol You sound more and more ignorant every comment. Keep it up, I want to see how far out you can go :)
$C: If government doesn't kill a monopoly it is because the monopoly bribes politicians.  Look at the history of AT&T (monopoly shattered and nearly rebuilt now with looser regulation) or more recently how Microsoft hasn't faced another government monopoly challenge since they started annually donating equally to both parties after the last challenge.  Government ruetinly prevents monopolies, especially in Europe, by denying mergers.

You seem to think government is required to prop up a monopoly, which isn't the case.  Government is the only thing that can kill a monopoly (other than the end of a products life cycle, such as whale oil.)

You think government is the problem, it isn't.  Consolidated wealth and bought politicians are the problem.
$C: No no no. It was obviously the Nazi zombies with help from secret pizza sex dungeon workers to convince us to nuke the moon. It's like you haven't even been paying attention.
$C: Those countries have bigger problems than restricted press freedom. 

The US doesn't score very highly, by the way. Probably because of a lack of a public broadcaster. 

And again. I repeat again. Refer to the courts. If you think courts are 100% biased and pointless then make that claim yourself. Because that's what you're trying to do here. Just be clear about what you're saying.

$C: dont bother w him, dude's a piece of shit, i've seen him attack ppl on a different subreddit multiple times
$C: Bartering will never go away, for as long as there are humans. Currency only serves as a 'middle-man' for bartering, and is absolutely necessary for corruption to exist as efficiently as possible. Currency is extremely convenient, yes, but it is incredibly easy to manipulate by very small groups of people via governments / institutions / banks.  This results in a massively disproportionate amount being funneled away from the vast majority of human beings, and this is an inevitable symptom of currency that we are seeing now (especially fiat currencies). The result is wage slavery for the rest of humanity, as well as the other problems I've mentioned. It is not at all necessary, especially with our current technology, as there is no actual shortage of resources, ever. We are duped into propping up useless industries that in-turn reward us with artificial monopolies. 

Naturally, the first solution is to have some self-respect as a species. Where we are now is obviously not even close to our own potential as a race. If we hope to avoid total and absolute ecocide, or a worldwide authoritarian plutocracy, then we will have to decide to re-structure our entire lives, and we will have to decide what that is together. We will all have to unlearn a lot of really terrible societal habits, and actively steer our own cultures instead of leaving it to institutions and corporations to steer them for us. 

The following is only my opinion as to potential ideas for the solution, and we should all talk more openly and share ideas about this if we hope to get anywhere at all. Personally, I imagine we will have to finally try to combine native aboriginal human concepts with our current and future technologies, a type of ultra-modern contributionism: everyone offers their skills to the group, and absolutely everyone receives the benefits. No one is excluded. The planet will have to be shared, collectively, and we will have to return to community-based living. A huge perk to this would be that any type of crisis or collapse would naturally become local, instead of a multi-national domino effect. In short, humanity will have to grow up. Life wouldn't be perfect, or Utopian, but it would be many light-years ahead of where we are now. 

If we do not change our current trajectory, we are in for a world of total and absolute shit. Not to mention a dead planet. 
$C: But have you actually spent one day on one? If you have, you'll agree that automation has made farming easier but in no way are we anywhere near complete farm automation. The harvesting, trucking, packaging, storing, selling, etc. I get precision planting and gps controlled combines, but even then some human influence is needed to properly control and maintain these systems. And that's just crops, we're even farther away from automating animal production. How are these farmers supposed purchase, acquire, install, and maintain systems like this? It makes no financial sense at this point, I'm not sure it ever will.
$C: > deliberately spreading disinformation

Thieves think everybody steals.  This guy accuses the new york times of "deliberately spreading disinformation" and used white house propaganda to cover for it.  I wonder why he sees people "deliberately spreading disinformation" everywhere he looks?
$C: It's a troll subreddit filled with genuinely insane people. I encourage anyone who is on the fence to visit and see for themselves.

As an example, this person I'm talking to is actively trying to rewrite history such that Obama didn't solidify net neutrality protections.

Read the link. See the executive orders. Look at the timeline.

Don't just believe internet trolls like this guy who get euphoric over articles written before any of this even happened. You'll end up brainwashed like them.

>Thats...that's not at all what I said.

You said the positive has as much proof as the negative. That's just shit epistemology. Like the mere claim that someone is a shill (and you should really check out the guy who made that accusation btw) means the probability he's a shill becomes 50/50.

Why is it important that you not get sucked into accusations like that? For real?
$C: Derburous dur ur demercresur?
$C: To the balance of our democracy extremely damgerous that is.
$C: The best jokes are the ones you run into the ground.
$C: So again. What were you saying was debunked? Didn't you say that this stuff having been going on for a long time had been debunked? And that I'm pushing agenda? Which is what? 
$C: I harp on about the word riot because you keep trying to argue \#NOTALLRIOTS when it is, in fact, all riots.

As far as riots sparking change? No. They spark a lot of innocent people getting hurt.

Do they spur *discussion*? Sure. But that's not a good enough reason to destroy peoples' lives when non-violent marches do that just as well.

As far as revolution? Good luck convincing most of us to embroil ourselves in a war we don't believe is necessary, and is guaranteed to destroy many of our own lives, when we have seen our entire lives that voting *does* work and shit does change for the better. It just doesn't change in an *instant.*

There's reasons you never see revolutions rise in developed first-world nations.
$C: Truth be told we need to revamp our education system along with our mental health. 

I'm not calling for absolute gun rights and I know the constitution doesn't either. A well regulated militia to me calls for a certain amount of regulation to ensure proper use and training, I would include mental stability in that as well. I think private sales should not be allowed and any loopholes that get around licensing, background checks, and mental health checks should be closed; this is considering any loopholes with gunshows. 

I would ideally like to see mandatory mental health screening, once a year. 

As far as what weapons should be allowed to own, I think we should treat that similarly to how we treat commercial driver's licenses. 

Another point is that media coverage seems to focus a lot on the killer, which breeds copycat incidents. That should change, although I'm not sure that can be legislated. 

We not only have inadequate mental health care in the USA but we have inadequate mental health education. While we're at it we have a woefully lacking health education system that should be part of everyone's education. Our education system should teach students how to cope and communicate their emotions as well as what healthy foods are. It's clear that parents as a whole are not hitting the mark on this. Licensing to have children would be an interesting idea but I can't begin to imagine the scorn that would be gather. 

Guns are a tool of force. Like all weapons they are equalizers, calling them murder machines doesn't properly respect the gravity of their purpose in today's world. The 2nd amendment is the teeth behind the bill of rights and people can't scoff at that all they want but that is plainly agreed upon by constitutional scholars across the aisle. Not sure if you are paying attention to China and their social credit score but it wouldn't take long for freedoms to erode here, not to say they aren't already.

$C: if you think your favorite notions are beyond question, you're gonna be in for a rough surprise in the next few years. everything post-1965 is up for grabs, my dude. the issue is not that the right is propagandizing and so is the left. the issue is that the right is going further right, and the left thinks it's the center. stop thinking your beliefs are the fucking default, and we might be able to talk our shit out for once.
$C: Sorry, somehow I didnt read the second half of  your last comment.  
  
I tend to fall more on the liberal side of things, so I at least have some experience talking to conservatives (online and in person) about issues. There are some that are completely unwilling to have a conversation and are very hostile/derogatory/demeaning, there are others that seem very much like a conservative version of me, willing to have a respectful conversation about our differences, and there are others (most people I feel) that are initially hostile but can calm down a bit and discuss the issues when they realize you arent simply immediately dismissing them as the enemy.  
  
On the internet we do a lot of this polarizing talk, circle-jerking and... whatever the opposite is, demonizing the other side.  
  
If we could show more people respect in regards to discussing political issues, then we'd likely develop a more positive cycle of communication.
$C: I'm saying the spectrum doesn't matter you dumb cunt.  You're so wrapped up in what box to put everybody into you can't even produce a single constructive thought other than BUILD DA WALL.

That's your grand plan for fixing a failing middle class, a ballooning plutocracy, an encroaching automation state, rampant gun violence, and dwindling education and science funding?  BUILD DA WALL.

Well folks, wrap it up.  The leftists can't *possibly* compete with the genius political ideology of putting bricks on top of one another.
$C: Go ahead, play dumb... only makes you look dumb.

This was at the top of the article in bold, you should try reading what you link too
$C: Next time don't try to pass off trash as recent news and I might give you a fair shake. It's unequivocally true that the dossier was funded by Hillary and that it has the factual integrity of a wet napkin. Cry about it more.
$C: Well, then you're an idiot.
$C: It’s finally baseball season again, so I will. The housing bubble was definitely the major factor in it but it was compounded by 2 ridiculously expensive wars. 
$C: I didn’t copy paste anything and I’m not losing sleep. I think it’s funny how averse you are to any kind of dissent actually. 

If you really look at it objectively, I’d say it’s ironic that you like Trump and hate cry babies. He’s kind of the whiniest cry baby in the country. 
$C: No, there’s not. You don’t know the definition of evidence. There is no evidence of that at all. 
$C: They did a terrible job deleting it then because I literally just watched it with audio and it doesn’t change anything. https://youtu.be/04RhsO_fyZQ
$C: It isn’t a loaded word, and they defined what they meant by “dreamer” in the first line of the article. If the best example you can find of the Washington Post having a bias is a different newspaper using the word dreamer, that tells me the Washington Post is pretty fucking reliable.

$C: >You seem to think government is required to prop up a monopoly, which isn't the case.

Then provide examples of monopolies that didn't/don't need government to maintain monopoly status. Do they not take advantage of limited liability and other protections under corporate personhood, and of regulations that created barriers to entry for potential competition?

>Government is the only thing that can kill a monopoly

Ignoring the fact that you already thought of an exception to this, how can you possibly know this? Support your claim.

>You think government is the problem, it isn't. Consolidated wealth and bought politicians are the problem.

"Bought politicians" is *exactly why government is the problem*. The two sentences quoted are in direct contradiction.

>AT&T

Same issue with the big ISPs nowadays. Granted monopoly access to infrastructure by local/state gov'ts in exchange for providing access to underpopulated places where it would otherwise be unprofitable. Take advantage of the current regulatory environment which keeps out startups. Even Google is giving up after its foray into the ISP industry because it's had such a hard time dealing with regulations. If you think AT&T then, and Comcast now, were/are not being propped up and subsidized by gov't, I've got a bridge to sell you.

>Microsoft

The idea that including IE in Windows was monopolistic is absurd. Is Apple anti-competitive for including Safari in MacOS? Is Google anti-competitive for including Chrome in Android? 
$C: 9/11 was a nuclear event. /r/nuclear911
$C: I don't think that at all about courts.

I just know for a fact that throughout all of history, the first thing authoritarian governments come for is the freedom of the press. Its essentially the same thing as restricting the freedom of speech. Its a disgrace to read anyone supporting that idea.

If something matters, I'll take the time to look into it. But in this case it didn't, and I didn't feel like getting into it with someone who just slung an accusation like that. It would end up going nowhere. I responded to you because you asked a legitimate question at the start, and now we're here. You make good points, and many people should look at them and think about how they deal with stuff. 
In this case, I didn't just disregard him, and in some cases agreed with what he said, in that people should vote, just that if the people don't vote every election, then they may as well not bother because then we continue this 4 steps back 2 steps forward bullshit rather than continuing to move forward.

It's opposition research, not some grand conspiracy.  Nice job omitting who it was originally funded by.  Can't have anyone share the blame with the evil witch doctor $hillary, right?

Media propaganda.

$C: >opposition research

>nothing in the dossier is proven and a sizable portion is outright lies

That's not opposition research, that's a hit piece and blatant propaganda, propaganda that you've willingly sucked down because of your biases.

I'm done with your projections, don't reply again.
$C: I never said I didnt.  Enjoy basking in your idiocy, just don't be disingenuous.  Revel in it, embrace it, just don't be a phony.
$C: I’m not saying the msm isn’t biased. Every person is biased and therefore so is every news source. However, just because something is reported on by the mainstream media doesn’t mean it’s fake or a lie. The reputable sources are bias by omission, they may not report on everything but they don’t make up stories otherwise they would lose all credibility. That’s why it’s important to read from a diverse group of reputable sources. You, however, seem to believe that a story is accurate only if it’s reported on by a few shady tabloid  “news” sources. 
$C: eh. the fact that you know echo chambers exist, and you know what are in the echo chambers is enough to defeat whatever derision you have about reddit.

It takes  5 seconds to realize that you can access the content in these places and make plenty of informed opinions and decisions. The fact that people compare places likr /r/politics and /r/the_donald and equivocate on them, the same way people think Sinclair broadcasting is doing god's work by repeating the neo nazi propaganda.

Shit's real dawg, and you're out here trying to say there's equal weight.

No dawg, the reason most things are main stream is because they benefit the most amount of people, particularly in a democracy. We can argue about the dark corners where certain fuzzy edges occur, but that's just memory dog. There's no hard line, except when it comes to bullshit Sinclair media and neo nazi propaganda.


$C: Lmao projections?  I just gave you another article written two months ago and you didn't read that either.  Here you are just bitching about propaganda instead because you're too much of a bitch to read something that might make you consider a new perspective.

You don't want me to reply because you have no response.

> a sizable portion is outright lies

Again, which part is lies?  Please be specific.
$C: > You, however, seem to believe that a story is accurate only if it’s reported on by a few shady tabloid “news” sources. 

Now you are lying about what I am saying. I am saying that media is posting everything bullshit about Trump without any evidence what so ever. And opposite about Obama they are keeping quiet about everything that would make headlines about Trump.


I asked to get a good news source but was not given one so I assume fox is just as reputable as anyone else.


Again we are in a thread talking about media propaganda and scripted news.

Now because of the dishonest people on r/videos I was just given a block so I cannot answer posts very often. even after not responding for a long time I got asked to wait for 5 minutes to post this response. Thank U Spez and other cunts running this cancerous website 
$C: > No dawg, the reason most things are main stream is because they benefit the most amount of people, particularly in a democracy.

i think even your side would dispute that claim immensely. arguing from majority is just going to fuck up any chance at improvement.

r/politics and r/the_donald aren't equivalent, because one admits to being a circlejerk and the other projects objectivity. the right and the left aren't equivalent because one believes it's partisan and the other believes it's the default. this is the crux of the issue.
$C: 
>  I am saying that media is posting everything bullshit about Trump without any evidence what so ever. 

But they’re not. The alleged Stormy Daniels affair is being reported on because there is evidence of it. He paid  her $130K to keep her mouth shut and is now suing her for $20 million because she didn’t. He’s doing this to keep her quietabout nothing?

> I asked to get a good news source but was not given one so I assume fox is just as reputable as anyone else.

Fox is far more reputable than The Globe or pjmedia that you sourced earlier. 

> Now because of the dishonest people on r/videos I was just given a block so I cannot answer posts very often. even after not responding for a long time I got asked to wait for 5 minutes to post this response. Thank U Spez and other cunts running this cancerous website 

Don’t blame them, you’re being made to wait because your comments are controversial and that’s because I’m down voting every one you make and nobody is up voting them. 
$C: dawg, i ain't got a side. If I could shoot a police officer because he's holding a phone, I'd withold judgement until he turned around.

There's no side here. News and media exist, and people have access to it as much or as little as they want, and they can decide whatever side they want. 

There's however a distinct possibility that nothing on the internet exists, and there's a hurge amount of dick waving going on.
$C: > He paid her $130K to keep her mouth shut and is now suing her for $20 million because she didn’t

Your own sources tells the opposite story.

A leftist whore that is irrelevant wants money as one of 20 women(?) 
is having a fight with a lawyer.

Obama would have had her killed long time ago.


What are we even talking about?


Leftist blueshare employees are losers and you are the perfect example.



REEEEEEEEEEE


BYEBYE
$C: Wow, you are the dumbest person on earth. How does my source tell the opposite? 
$C: The lawyer for adult film star Stormy Daniels told ABC News on Wednesday that Donald Trump **must have known** about the deal negotiated just days before the 2016 election to pay the actress $130,000 to keep quiet about her alleged 2006 affair with Trump.


“Any suggestion that he didn't know about it is, quite honestly, absurd,” said Michael Avenatti, Daniels’ attorney. “**We believe that** he absolutely knew about it.”


****

This story is just as believable as the other 19
$C: Why else would he have paid her $130k and why he’s suing her now?
$C: hes a lawyer and that is what he makes his living of
$C: So you’re saying lawyers just regularly pay random people 130k to keep their mouth shut about nothing and then sue them for 20 million when they don’t? That makes absolutely no sense.  What makes the allegations that Obama smoked crack with gay lovers more believable than stormy Daniel’s allegations against trump? I think it’s just that you want the allegations against Obama to be true and you want the allegations against trump to be false. 
$C: Glad to here you finally admit they are allegations. But you are loosing focus. We are talking about the media portrayal of tem and the difference.
$C: I don’t think you know what the word allegation means. We’re still on topic. Don’t ignore the question. Why are the allegations against Obama more believable to you than the allegations against trump?
