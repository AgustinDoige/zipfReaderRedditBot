Spectator at PyeongChang

$C: *"Honey, please do not embarrass me in front of millions of people tonight."*

*"Babe, it's billions.  I only do billions now.  Deal with it."*
$C: Pretty sure this is one of the athletes. It looks like he's wearing the team jacket, and is sitting in the team kiss-and-cry area for Korea. Nonetheless- sick move.
$C: When you're cool, the sun shines on you 24 hours a day.
$C: God damn that was smooth
$C: Oh snap, a rare double deal-with-it. 10/10.
$C: That's /u/kambam95. He is an Olympic figure skater for South Korea. The dude is awesome and deserves some recognition for his skill at figure skating and his dedication to the memes.

Edit: Don't know if it is him, but I caught this Korean guy dabbing at the opening ceremony and I'm hoping it is him.

Edit 2: [Confirmed!](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/7wwmpv/spectator_at_pyeongchang/du3xefi/) We are in for a meme filled Olympics this year bois. Papa bless /u/kambam95 and may his memes stand the test of time!
$C: The Olympics have barely started and this guy has already won everything
$C: The double glasses are cool, but hot damn what a great effort at not pissing himself with laughter at the reveal. He almost breaks, but he kept his shit together and now he has this moment forever.
$C: Why do I get the feeling his whole life lead up to that moment
$C: That's Alex Kang Chang Bam! His insta is pretty funny too. [link](https://www.instagram.com/alex_kambam/?hl=en)
$C: Ok watching the Olympics I‚Äôm convinced that all South Koreans just love goofing off. I love it. 
$C: I love how he was just wearing the double glasses anyway, even before he saw the camera
$C: [deleted]
$C: Spoiler Alert: He is completely blind.

$C: Was anybody else desperately hoping he had a third pair on under that one?
$C: That hint of smile says it all...he can barely contain his own glee.

This was planned.

He knows what he did.

$C: I think that girl has a permanent 'I'm about to cry' face
$C: It's weird as fuck how little funny things in some events that are filmed and made as gifs and posted in here always get over 100k upvotes.
$C: How the fuck could he see well enough to know when his cue came!

(Context that I think it‚Äôs showing a skater after she‚Äôs done her routine and that skater is his sister)

$C: Actually, you would be warm with that much sunshine 
$C: Wouldn't the  sun shining on you 24 hours a day increase your body temperature slowly sapping you of said coolness?
$C: holly shit, that's a reference I never expected to hear. 
$C: Am gonna use that!
$C: For some reason that made me feel great. Imma start being cool now to be happy I guess 
$C: When the upvotes on your comments have more upvotes.
$C: THE SUN NEVER SETS ON A BAD ASS
$C: I'm mean, with two sun glasses, *was he* spectating? 
$C: "the sun's always shinin' when you're cool" is the phrase
$C: I think I'm pregnant now just from watching that

I'll excuse myself.

$C: I just told this girl that was the smoothest guy at the Olympics, smooth as shit. Then open the comments. Fucking confirmed.

Edit: I found it so funny that she now thinks I'm an idiot.
$C: Hold up ya‚Äôll, I need to take my shades off. Here hold this. *takes his shades off and looks at the camera.*

$C: He is like a real life version of Space Dandy. 
$C: Need to add the thuglife text drop down

$C: THAT WAS ME DABBING TOO AHAHAHHA!!! I wanna make this olympics a very MEMEorable one!!!! 
$C: This guy is becoming reddit famous after [that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/7waigz/korea_reping_the_nash/) on /r/h3h3productions

[Rep](https://youtu.be/qtiOdWwLMQw?t=8m2s) the [Naysh!](https://i.redd.it/87l9xsn6s3f01.png)

Proof it's him: https://i.imgur.com/nexyBbH.jpg
$C: It'll only be a matter of time till the meme exposure to North Korean athletes unifies both countries under one vape naysh.
$C: I find it very amusing how kambam was a somewhat frecuent poster of r/me_irl and he is also an olympic athlete. r/Absolutelynotmeirl     
    What a cool dude!
$C: I like that this thread has been going on for several hours now and he has been identified, but no one has mentioned his real name instead opting to exclusively refer to him by his Reddit username. 
$C: "Dedication to the memes"

You have found Reddit's Batman.
$C: You‚Äôre about to make it rain karma. 
$C: /u/h3h3productions get this guy on the podcast!
$C: I can‚Äôt wait until a week later when they talk about this on the mainstream news
$C: What‚Äôs his name so I can look him up 
$C: I wonder if anyone got the glorious snot bubble from (I think) the first male figure skater in the first event. 
$C: Cool
$C: good luck another fellow alex ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èI'll be watching. throw down some memes and your kyueun 
$C: Me irl
$C: Dance around the Meme Tree! Come sing some meme Carol's!
$C: Oh man oh man. I would love to see a meme filled Olympics. During skating routines and just random
moments of fun. 
$C: Mmmmm where's the proof? Don't want to be a jackass but you and kambam could easily be two friends trying to troll reddit or just farming karma and reddit gold :/

Edit: Nevermind!
$C: Are you sure he's not di lung from courage the cowardly dog?
$C: Is he the same guy who did the magic finger ring trick in the background on an old reddit post?
$C: YOU HEARD THE MAN, GET THE MEME STRETCHER!
$C: This is the greatest thread I've seen all day!
$C: I now have a big treasonous crush on the enemy. I guess I‚Äôm rooting for South Korea instead of the us this year
$C: This is already my favorite moment from the Winter Olympics.

This and that one speed skating race where the guy in last jumps to first in the last lap because everyone ahead of him gets wiped out.
$C: And what did he win? 

Another pair of hater-blockers.
$C: Dudes eyebrows are on point.  Glasses off and on
transition smoothly. A+
$C: Well, someone give him gold already!!!
$C: Smooth as a 30-year-old oak barrel scotch.
$C: That's it. Game over, everyone go home.
$C: Shut up and take all my medals!!!!
$C: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5103F3DHQ0L.jpg
$C: Locked up all medals and murdered thousands of innocent ladies...... That is a serious dude.
$C: Idk, that Korean Olympian who held up the vape nation sign is pretty up there too
$C: Take all those condoms at the olympic village and give em to this dude.
$C: No. 
$C: >now he has this moment forever.

Pending the results of the drug tests, he stands to win the Gold.
$C: Cheeky smirk. He knows it.  

$C: What I like is how the camera was really wanting to point to the girl then when he did his reveal the camera forgot the girl and began zooming hard to him lol.
$C: It helps because it gives him that all-knowing smirk. 
$C: When you put shades on you immediately become 10x cooler so he probably just felt cool as fuck rather than laughing.
$C: Wasn't even close to breaking and I never doubted him. This dude's a pro
$C: Is it just me or is this guy definitely a redditor? Lurker at least. 
$C: Colder and cooler than the Winter Olympics.
$C: Did he break? Is this a case of gifs that end too soon?
$C: We sure it wasn't set up?
$C: Was looking for this. That slight grin is there but he holds it together in the end. 
$C: I know the complete gif is somewhere, but he breaks right after this gif ends and he begins to cheer and bring out a flag right after
$C: Well technically it did...
$C: He is an Olympic athlete, so it technically did.
$C: Every injury, every time he missed a night out with friends because of practice, every gruelling competition leading up to finally make it to the greatest competition of them all...it all became worth it the moment the camera zoomed in and turned him into a meme.  
$C: I would have fucked it up so bad. 
$C: Such a fucking a player /u/kambam95 . 
$C: This guy memes
$C: It‚Äôs so fun to take a glance into SK when they‚Äôre not in a serious competition, like Starcraft.
$C: It looks like he's sitting in the Korean team box they have set up for the figure skating team event, in which case he could reasonably expect a camera on him there.
$C: [An even earlier version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCl5CoFdY3Q&feature=youtu.be&t=16s) starring a guy that kind of looks like young nick cage, and later another guy that kind of looks like shia labeouf.
$C: I wish there were more comedies like this today.
$C: Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit smoking. 
$C: Surely you can‚Äôt be serious
$C: I was thinking bucket head guy.
$C: I was half hoping nobody had posted this so I could be the bearer of awesomeness.  Kudos, good sir!

Edit: Don't call me shirley.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I was looking for this.  Thank you.
$C: Completely blind going to spectate the olympics...

$C: That would have been horrible, if he took off the shades and instead of another shades, it was those creepy eyes. 
$C: [Are we doing this?](https://media.giphy.com/media/fyKJK96KQTnR6/giphy.gif)
$C: That actor would make a good Johnny Cage.

$C: this guy is my best friend and irl brother. Despite being very proud of Alex's Olympic journey, this is right here is both our proudest moment. Papa bless you all.
$C: OMEGALUL look who it is 
$C: This is the proudest moment of the olympics. Papa bless. 
$C: This is like watching a family reunion.
$C: Is zoop still a thing?
$C: Heeeyy yeeahh, I wanna SHOOP
$C: He's already got one.
$C: Holy shit, I just noticed the girl after 10 loops
$C: She also has a fake nose. Fire her plastic surgeon
$C: Underrated comment.
$C: Indeed.
$C: I think it is just the bright lighting in the stadium, combined with the colour contrast of this shot (perhaps affected by the fact the person was filming a TV or computer screen). The lighter colours in the shot are ‚Äúpeaking‚Äù out and it is washing out the features of her face, probably obscuring the shape/bridge of her nose. Same with the dude on the far right. Also, one has to account for the ‚Äúwaves‚Äù effect we are seeing from the screen being filmed.
$C: Her nose looks like a pig snout
$C: South Korea is huge on plastic surgery. 
$C: All their noses look like that. I don't know why it looks weird. But it does. 
$C: What the hell is up with their noses?  Especially the woman that stays in frame.  That can't be natural, but if it's not... why on earth would you want your nose to be like that?

$C: Yeah I agree with you on that Blue. If you take a look closely at the replay, you can see his hand gets just a *little* squirrely on the connect transition‚Äîjudges will likely deduct 3 tenths from his technical score on that. But overall, he nailed his pose solidly, with a perfect charisma closer, so he still has a great chance to make the podium‚Äîprobably even taking gold.  
  
I think it's just great to see someone who has given so much for the sport have the chance to show their stuff on the international stage and tonight, he has surely done so while making his country proud. Back to you, Blue.
$C: I am , and don't call me surely!
$C: Yup.

$C: NK would have to build their infrastructure for five more years to support his dank moves, so until then he‚Äôs banned.
$C: They usually have good faces but have flat asses and the vagina looks like roast beef.  Dark on the outside and pink in the center.  Usually a bit dry
$C: Lol huh? Be a little open minded old man. 
$C: Go out more. Living in a bubble your size sucks. 
$C: Why do white Americans have to comment ignorant things 
$C: That we all could be so dank on the first go. 
$C: ...explain how you came to the conclusion that olympic-level athletes live in their parents basements. 
$C: Who says these facilities will remain unused after the party is over? This is South Korea we are talking about.
$C: I work at the Olympics and at sports events in general. While what you say might be true for places like Athens or Rio, this is South Korea. The olympic park and all facilities from the summer games 1988 in Seoul are in top condition are still very much used. 

Also yes it cost billions but it's already scaled back alot compared to the ridiculous 50 billion Sotchi cost. Here the province that hosts the games has to pay itself and doesn't get funding from the central government. 
$C: You mean Rich Brian?

Is this like a Valli brothers parody band in the 80's? It almost seems too self-aware to be an actual 60's band. I love the chick in black in the front so hopped up on coke that she can't stop dancing (she literally wipes some coke off her nose at one point). Ohhh the 80's.

Edit: I recognize some of the band's other songs now. I never realized this was a band from the 80's that plays this 50s/60s style of music. Also sad to see that apparently the lead singer got multiple sclerosis and stopped performing shortly after this.
$C: Is that Adam Driver?/s

$C: No, they're memes now
$C: Now I can‚Äôt even tell myself that Reddit is the reason I‚Äôm not in the Olympics
$C: LMFAO i still stand by my words. 
$C: Those are wise words. And I shall follow them also.

It's pretty cool so far though
$C: It's 2069 baby
$C: Where nothing matters do whatever the hell you want while having a good time.
$C: Thank you man, now I can hype with the rest of reddit, bless you!
$C: Yes, but the US is competing against South Korea in the olympics. South Korea‚Äôs medals don‚Äôt count for the us medal total even though we are politically aligned. But he‚Äôs so cool I‚Äôll have to root against my own nation
$C: Thank you, Internet angel
$C: Our first ever winter Olympics gold i might add
$C: The multiple slo mo shots are my favorite part
$C: Slow and steady wins the race...
$C: He won our admiration, Uneven. He won our hearts

$C: You need to obviously get yours on point.  /s
$C: Yeah, everyone knows eyebrows are either on fleek or nothin. 
$C: Reported as spammer
$C: Ray banned for being too dope
$C: Sorry, kinda unrelated but you reminded me of something that just happened at work the other day. 

I'm an entry level BMW mechanic, like fresh out the oil and lube rack. I got assigned a new job, a valve cover gasket. It paid 8 hours so I'm like 'ah shit'. I hate calling my team leader for help because it wastes his time but I'm gonna have to ask him like a hundred times in this one. So about three hours later I finish torquing the last bolt to the specs (got a program that has specs and whatnot) without having bothered him once. I'm just shocked, like what the hell did I miss. Went on a super long test drive just wondering what would fuck up.  

So yeah, I literally was shocked and ended up laughing at the concept of me doing a job correctly. 
$C: Well 10x0 is still 0.

Luckily I'm normally a -1
$C: Highly unfulfilled and disappointed
$C: The Roman Empire died and later ww2 happened and nukes were created and everything including those moments lead to you reading this comment, history is simply a understanding of the past ; hard work is the root to all our problems and the solution to them
$C: The crowd is fantastic. 
$C: I like the guy on the right when the performer forst walks down the stairs. He looks like Ken Bones brother
$C: you‚Äôre an asshole
$C: Tommy Lee Jones?
$C: Jon Hamm?
$C: Nick Offerman?
$C: Yeah they got Audio Description on certain screenings, Subtitled ones and Autism Friendly ones too which have someone describing certain scenes on screen that may be a bit harder to understand. My wife‚Äôs family is deaf so we go to the subtitled screenings on occasion.

$C: Pooz yeah!
$C: Maybe people think you meant "all of them" in a racist way against everyone there, not just the people in the post. That's all I can imagine for the downvotes
$C: Cool. I just looked. There‚Äôs an r/funny post at 283k and 2 pics posts at 230k
$C: That's a dumb thing to say. That would imply every smoker ever cares what others think of them. It has nothing to do with looking cool, that is what a 5th grade child might come up with.
$C: .......and I feel like an idiot. So used to the other subreddit.

$C: I accidentally met Dylan and Coke Sprouse once. Was visiting my great aunt in LA, and she asked if I‚Äôd go with her to her friends house for tea. My sis said no, but I said to my self ‚Äúwhy the hell not?‚Äù .  We are there for nearly 45 min when Dylan and Cole come out of a bedroom. I look at my G Aunt like ‚Äúwhat the fuck!?‚Äùshe then tells me that her friend was their grandmother. I shook their hands and they left.  And that‚Äôs how I met Zach and Cody lol. Damn did they live a sweat life 
$C: Do sports. They show up at competitions every now and then. Or go outside. I don't know if the last one works though.

quick question if you dont mind sharing. after you shared your name, I looked u up. looks like you were born in New Zealand. What made you go back to Korea, bceome an olympic athlete, and even represent korea instead of New zealand?

Plus, its the damn Olympics, people, spectator and Olympian alike go to to these games to represent their country. That means the express implication that other countries are judging the performance and behavior of everyone at all times is a basically a standard.

like it or not people judge you on your actions. Youre just butt hurt because you dont like it.

Both of my parents are Korean but I was born in New zealand so I have dual citizenship. When Pyeongchang was chosen as the host for the 2018 Olympics it became my dream to compete in Korea for Korea! 
$C: Not Kambam, so I can't speak for him, but an athlete doesn't have to live in the country they represent for the Olympics, they just require proof of heritage or citizenship.

For example, a lot of US athletes from immigrant parents decide to represent their parents' or grandparents' countries instead of their own, even if they've never really been there, partly as a 'get in touch with their roots' thing, or to give their underdog heritage nation a shot at a medal.

$C: You're now representing redditors. Do us proud. :,)
$C: Kia ora bro. Fellow Kiwi here! Do you still reside in NZ at all? I imagine it wouldn't be easy training in New Zealand if you were still there early in your career. I was always annoyed that the Queenstown Ice Arena was closed during the summer when I wanted to go the most.

$C: It can also sometimes be because either A. that home country has a stronger program in your sport that allows you to grow and strengthen more than you would otherwise; or B. that home country has a weaker program in your sport, that allows you to more easily stand out and earn a spot at the games that you otherwise wouldn't have been able to get.
$C: I hate that about the olympics. Half the people are clearly living and training in the US and have been for years based on speaking English with zero accent.

$C: At this time of the year?
$C: I actually trained with the North Korean figure skating pair team when they visited Montreal for 2 months. They are really hard working and friendly people so it wasn't hard at all to get close to them. They're weren't too open about sharing their personal lives but we talked a lot about our skating lives and our training. 
Personally, I was quite surprised when the combined women's hockey team was announced a month before the olympics because that meant that some South Korean players might not get any play time. It seemed a little unfair to the athletes who worked hard to make the olympic team, only to get benched because of politics. However, in the big picture, I think it shows a little bit of hope and promise for the future. 
That's just my two cents thanks for reading ladies and gentlemen. 
$C: He‚Äôs taken a picture with one of the North Korean athletes on his ig. So I‚Äôm curious as well.
$C: Scenario B,  I see that sometimes in European soccer where players won't make the stronger European squads but are good enough to make it back 'home'

$C: Yeah I grew up in an immigrant community and knew someone who was training for a summer Olympics sport, and she said she was aiming for our home country's team because she knew it would be less competitive.

Going to the Olympics is just awesome, so I don't blame these kids at all for being strategic about how they try to get there.
$C: Do it!

$C: There's a Korean skater name An Hyun Soo (now Viktor An) he's the opposite. Was the best skater in Korea, had a falling out with the Korean skating association, so couldn't compete for Korea, left to become a Russian citizen, competed and won a few medals as a Russian citizen and this year because of the doping scandal he cannot compete again! talk about getting shafted
