The FCC’s vote was predictably frustrating, but we’re not done fighting for net neutrality.
Following today’s disappointing vote from the FCC, Alexis and I wanted to take the time to thank redditors for your incredible activism on this issue, and reassure you that we’re going to continue fighting for the free and open internet. 

Over the past few months, we have been floored by the energy and creativity redditors have displayed in the effort to save net neutrality. It was inspiring to witness [organic takeovers](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7j8fkt/an_analysis_of_net_neutrality_activism_on_reddit/) of the front page \(twice\), read touching [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) about how net neutrality matters in users’ everyday lives, see bills about net neutrality [discussed on the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7j6kn4/congress_has_set_out_a_bill_to_stop_the_fcc/) \(with over 100,000 upvotes and cross-posts to over 100 communities\), and watch redditors exercise their voices as citizens in the [hundreds of thousands of calls](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2017/11/22/reddit-net-neutrality-fcc-protest/) they drove to Congress.

It is disappointing that the FCC Chairman plowed ahead with his planned repeal despite all of this [public concern](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/12/this-poll-gave-americans-a-detailed-case-for-and-against-the-fccs-net-neutrality-plan-the-reaction-among-republicans-was-striking/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-card-technology%3Ahomepage%2Fcard&utm_term=.d11780a12cc2), not to mention the [objections expressed by his fellow commissioners](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/12/16766324/fcc-commissioners-clyburn-rosenworcel-net-neutrality), [the FCC’s own CTO](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/13/net-neutrality-repeal-warning-eric-burger-fcc-259968), [more than a hundred members of Congress](https://doyle.house.gov/sites/doyle.house.gov/files/documents/20171213DoyleNDelayLtrAll.pdf), [dozens of senators, and the very builders of the modern internet](https://www.salon.com/2017/12/12/senators-internet-pioneers-pen-letters-to-fcc-asking-to-cancel-thursdays-net-neutrality-vote/). 

Nevertheless, today’s vote is the beginning, not the end. While the fight to preserve net neutrality is going to be longer than we had hoped, this is far from over.

Many of you have asked what comes next. We don’t exactly know yet, but it seems likely that the FCC’s decision will be challenged in court soon, and we would be supportive of that challenge. It’s also possible that Congress can decide to take up the cause and create strong, enforceable net neutrality rules that aren’t subject to the political winds at the FCC. Nevertheless, this will be a complex process that takes time.

What is certain is that Reddit will continue to be involved in this issue in the way that we know best: seeking out every opportunity to amplify your voices and share them with those who have the power to make a difference. 

This isn’t the outcome we wanted, but you should all be proud of the awareness you’ve created. Those who thought that they’d be able to quietly repeal net neutrality without anyone noticing or caring learned a thing or two, and we still may come out on top of this yet. We’ll keep you informed as things develop.

update: Please note the FCC is not united in this decision and find the dissenting statements from commissioners [Clyburn and Rosenworcel](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16776712/fcc-commissioners-democrat-statements-net-neutrality).

update2 (9:55AM pst): While the vote has not technically happened, we decided to post after the two dissenting commissioners released their statements. However, the actual vote appears to be delayed for security reasons. We hope everyone is safe.

update3 (10:13AM pst): The FCC votes to repeal 3–2.
$C: Does democracy and public outcry mean nothing anymore?

95% of unique comments made to the FCC were in support of Net neutrality and 25 million total comments were sent!

**We the people spoke and we the people were ignored**. 

Not once did the FCC even offer to have a public hearing to discuss Net Neutrality but rather they shut their doors and laughed at our comments. They outright mocked us in an attempt to make our opinions less important and to make our outcry seem like the work of trolls. 

There is still more we can do. We **need** Congress to step up and to create their own laws protecting Net Neutrality so make your voiced heard Reddit and fuck the FCC.
$C: The fact that Ajit Pai made a video mocking us shows how little they care. We haven't made enough of an impact so we need to keep going!
$C: Just because the FCC has gone against the wishes of the country it is supposed to be serving, **this does not mean we should stop fighting for net neutrality!**

Don't let this be a defeat; *let this be further motivation to make your voice heard even more and to keep going in your efforts until we get net neutrality established as a law!*
$C: This dude talking just said "hopefully Congress makes a set of rules preventing payed priority for businesses" THEN WHATS THE FUCKING POINT OF REPEALING IT DIPSHIT 
$C: Mignon Clyburn is my hero today. Her speech was so powerful. She listened to us; it's too bad no one is listening to her.

ETA: I'm so proud that *this* is my most upvoted comment. Thanks, everyone. ☺
$C: The fact that the FCC is choosing to do this really saddens me. Thank you for fighting so hard for net neutrality Reddit.
$C: Make sure you guys remember that while some congressmen sent a letter of support for net neutrality, more than 100 members of the House sent a letter supporting Ajit Pai. Do not under any circumstances let them forget that they ignored the will of the people, and support their opponents in the 2018 elections - even if that means you have to vote for someone from a party you hate because your district has no one from the party you prefer.

Here's the letter supporting Ajit Pai. See if your rep signed it.

Link with 84 of the 107 names in print, the rest are still being translated from whatever demonic language they were written in:
https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/7xwknx/republican-members-of-congress-fcc-letter
$C: The organizations behind [Battle For The Net](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) are launching a new campaign to demand that Congress step in and restore net neutrality via [Congressional Review Act](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R43992.html) (CRA). 

The CRA let’s our elected officials in Congress overrule actions taken by Federal agencies like the FCC. And it’s different from a normal bill because it only requires a simple majority in the Senate and House to pass. Given the level of public backlash and polls showing that 83% of voters from across the political spectrum oppose the FCC’s plan, and given that several Republicans have already started to publicly criticize the FCC vote, we have a real chance to making this happen. **But it won’t be easy, and it can only happen within 60 legislative days of the order going into effect.**

**We can’t stop now. [Contact your reps today and demand that they preserve net neutrality through Congressional Review Act](https://www.battleforthenet.com/)**

You’ll see a script on your screen, or you can say something like this:
>I support Title II net neutrality, and I urge you to use the Congressional Review Act to pass a “resolution of disapproval” reversing the FCC’s December vote to repeal the Open Internet Order.”

**You can also text "BATTLE" to 384-387 to use a simple chat-bot to send a message to your lawmakers**

We can still win this. Even if you’ve already contacted your reps, now is the time to call them again. We need all hands on deck. Please, take a moment and make the call, then spread the word, sticky this post, or help drive traffic to https://www.battleforthenet.com 

$C: I posted this elsewhere, but I feel like copying it here.

The death of Net Neutrality will not affect you overnight like most places are reporting. You won't pay $10 for Facebook, $5 for streaming sites, etc... or things like that. You won't have access to certain sites blocked.

Rather, it will happen slowly and secretly over the next few years, which is arguably worse. You'll notice Netflix and Twitch will start buffering more and more while your ISP sends you a mailer to buy their cable/movie package. Your VoIP will drop calls while your ISP promotes a competitor at a "special" price. Independent online games will struggle to have reliable pings while AAA games seem to have no problem.

How do we know this will happen? Because ISPs have already tried this in the past when the legality was unclear. Now that it's fully legal, what will stop them?

In the meantime, you'll forget. When they don't charge $3 for access to Netflix, you'll think to yourself that the whole #NetNeutrality cause was overblown. You won't notice the gradual decline of your ISP, and you'll forget what you once expected of them. The ISPs will win unless we continue to fight, but I find it hard to believe that we can maintain this anger for so much longer.

ISPs have done this before. And repealing Net Neutrality only enables them more.
$C: The vote is going to be disappointing but we know this isn’t the end.

-This will immediately get into a court battle and I think it looks favorable to us. Pai has been so flagerant on ignoring the people that’ll be a factor. That and, more importantly, he has outright ignored several Attorney Generals on the matter of the fake comments on his own site. I have to imagine that is going to play a MAJOR rule in court. Also, one of the dissenters in Michael O’Reilly bluntly stated they were never going to consider those comments anyways whether they were “bots or not”. Might be a big factor in the courts as well.

-We gotta keep pestering our reps. We’ve seen that a few GOP members have flip flopped in favor of NN. The more we keep expressing our disgust in this the more likely they could pass something in Congress. We’ve done it before with the healthcare repeal and we can do it here.

I just don’t want people to give up or have a defeatist attitude on this. Yes, it does suck the vote will go the way we don’t want it. But the fact of the matter is that it isn’t over. Not by a long shot.
$C: Seeing the video Ajit Pai made, basically mocking Internet users, made me incredibly mad.

It's clear he thinks that those of us who were fighting against him are basically mindless idiots who only use the most basic things the Internet offers. People like him are what's wrong with this world. So much greed,  and ego.  Looking down on the "Little guys".

He fails to mention that we'll still be able to do all these things relatively free of charge. We all know that the things that were so simple to do at one point, are suddenly going to become more difficult as companies put things behind pay walls.  

I hope this doesn't last very long,  that somehow, some way, it gets overturned. I just know the second companies see that extra $$$ rolling in from us, a lot more are going to follow and it will become the new norm.


$C: KEEP PUSHING THIS ISSUE!  Courts can help.  Actual laws enacted by congress can help.  The FCC isn't all powerful.  Keep fighting!!!
$C: There is an immediate plan to overturn the FCC vote. The organizations behind [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com) are calling on Congress to use a Resolution of Disapproval under the Congressional Review act to nullify their decision. It only takes a simple majority in the House and Senate. We can do it. **[Call your reps now!](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**
$C: I love how the one guy said they didn't care about the comments, but then said if you wanted to express your opinion to write a comment.  
$C: Don't get discouraged.

The flood of protests received by the FCC and our representatives act as a record of where we, as a people stand.

People that, in spite of his eggregious actions, Pai claims to represent. Even though they are blatantly false, his justifications for this action are worded as though it is on our behalf.

Now we have an overwhelming record that this is not what we want, and it is not in our best interest. And he's going to do it anyway.

This is important. It may be the key to undoing this, and holding Pai responsible.

In the realm of law, and government it is near impossible to objectively prove a policy good or bad. It's far easier to show a failure to follow proper procedure, or contradiction of one's duty, and own stated intentions. These latter faults are where we've irrefutably shown Pai has crossed the line.

There's already signs that this may be the area of focus in fighting back, in conjuction with the FCC not addressing its previous flood of fraudulent comments. 

Note the language, in the official objections below about the legitimacy of the process, the scope of the FCC's reach, and the dubious motives of those involved.

Take heart in these public servants that stand with us, along with 18 US AGs, and many more.

They are fighting the good fight to win the war, not the battle.

It can feel like we're screaming into the void. But we have given those that can fight this a great tool: a public record demonstrating that Pai and the FCC are acting against our interests, against their oaths, and against their own words.

EDIT: fixed broken link to Senator Warren's post + speech. Thanks u/preppypoof for pointing it out.
$C: u/spez, u/arabscarab, u/kn0thing:

If a Comcast or Verizon or whoever approaches reddit and says they're basically putting together a "Social Media Elite Pro MegaAccess" package that gives you a different level of access (non-throttled or maybe even priority traffic) to your website, are you willing to sign that deal?

The users are going to get the short end of this stick but the long end still reaches out to the sites that are cordoned off by un-neutral net.
$C: The three FCC votes to repeal are disgusting.
Just no shame to their bribe taking.
The current guy talking and trying to justify the repeal is just filled with contradictions and lies.  
Damn it's sickening to know this level of corruption can happen openly in 2017.


Edit : The major argument for repealing seems to be "let's go back to bipartisan and how the Internet flourished before 2015. Things were fiiiiine then and I'm sure the telecoms won't try to screw people in the future if we go back to the way it was!"
It's complete crock. The law was a reaction to recognizing a vulnerability in the system which could screw the consumers. It was the government protecting the rights of the people against corporations.  Difficult to imagine, I know.

Edit 2 :  Listening to Pai now.  Infuriating.  The second big argument is roughly similar to trickle down economics.  "Companies can't be competitive if we regulate them!  They won't be able to make any money and invest!  If we just let them be I'm sure they will pay workers well and create lots of jobs! They won't abuse their power to throttle like they have in the past! "  Yeah.  Sure.

Edit 3 : The 3 aye's take it.  Pai congratulates everyone for their eeeexcellent work.

Edit 4 : Mignon Clyburn was super.  She had some really great points and it seems like the issue won't end today.  Nice to see all the links in this thread on ways for people to voice their opinions.  

Lol the potato guy pretty much just said thnx get the camera away hehe don't zoom in on my fat wallet please.
$C: This is absolutely mind-boggling to me. The malicious lies, the no shame bullshitting on how the repeal is not going to matter or even, it is going to make it even better and freer - this is just insane to me. 

It's like the government would just one day decide "hey you know how we put people who kill others in prison? yeah that's because of old laws and it's not needed anyway, in fact, people are going to murder less when we take away this archaic and needless restriction"

And the way they spin it. The way they say it - that they are for internet freedom. Fucking sickens me. Disgusting, corrupted, spineless people.
$C: Well, they did it, despite the fact a majority of voters in either party oppose it. Something akin to 80+% of the population opposes it on the whole.

They didn't care. They won't start caring.

Petitions were faked, identities stolen to do so. New York found over 2 million identities to have been stolen to fake anti-Net Neutrality comments... but they didn't halt the vote. The FCC refused to cooperate in New York's investigation.

No amount of petitions, phone calls, emails, letters, etc... got through to the GOP. It's not going to start working now. The only things you can do, now, are vote the people who let this happen out of office and take the ISPs to the courts when applicable.

[It is worth noting: This has been a partisan issue with the GOP siding against net neutrality.](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7jsbgm/the_fcc_meeting_for_net_neutrality_has_begun/dr8tpfc/)

Mark this and vote accordingly. 

The GOP is in the majority in the FCC and the FCC Commissioners' votes were down party lines. Remember their disregard of the public trust in 2018, remember it in 2020.

It can be undone -- the Telecom companies will try their best to profiteer in the interim knowing full well that their time is limited. Take them to task legally whenever they overstep their bounds and hold free speech hostage for more money.

Remember this breach of Democracy, this betrayal of the over 80% of Americans who did not want this.

VOTE... THEM... OUT.
$C: Commissioner Clyburn gave an amazing heartfelt eulogy in favor of Net Neutrality ... at which Ajit replied "So, that's a no" and everyone laughed.

What a heartless corporate shill.

Ajit said "Let consumers decide who prevails," but most consumers only have 1 option. Of course they are going to choose the only internet they can get. And the consumers did decide. They sent millions of comments online telling the FCC "No", but Adjit and his cronies just ignored all of us.
$C: When was the last time 83% of the American people agreed on anything?  I don’t even think 83% of population would agree that oxygen is important. So, as a giant middle finger to those 83% they plowed through any sort of protest or phone call or letter or email just to shove this up our collective butts. 

Politicians and bureaucrats are the worst people in the world and if we let them fuck everything up then by god they will fuck everything up. 
$C: If you can and are willing, consider visiting your House Rep.'s office: An in-person visit and conversation will leave a deeper impression on the legislator's staff. The offices are open to the general public and anybody can come in during their work hours, no appointment needed. You're not likely to get to speak to the legislator themself, but their staffers, especially if you ask for and get their legislative director, help shape a legislator's world view and actions, and our goal is to let them know their constituents care deeply about net neutrality. You'll find that the people at the office will be very nice to you and not at all antagonistic, after all, they want your support! You may also find that your Rep. has an office conveniently near you or your commute!

Some additional tips:

When talking to a congressional office, there are 3 key pieces of info you want to make sure you get across (the ones with decent staff will ask you for the info, but some of them slack): Your name+your address (so they know you're an individual in their district), the issue you care about and which side of it you're on.

In addition to talking to the staffers, every congressional office I've been to (and I've been to lots) will have a form you can fill out where you can write down your concerns. Be sure to ask for the form and write down your support for net neutrality!

Congressional offices are almost always open 9-5, weekdays.

The truism "the squeaky wheel gets the grease" applies. Our goal here is to squeak loudly for net neutrality, and if possible, squeak in person!
$C: 83% of Americans vote for no. Decision is yes. DEMOCRACY!!!! FREEDOM!!!!1!
$C: "On the advice of security, we're going to take a brief recess".

https://www.fcc.gov/general/live

Ok that sounds like someone either broke into the building, bomb threat, etc. Right in the middle of Pai's remarks. MAN this is getting THRILLING!

Knowing how shady the FCC has been recently, I wouldn't be surprised if this was Ajit's idea to "delay the vote" while trying to save face and still blame NN protesters as being at fault/being violent/"they're evil since they tried to stop the vote, so that means we're doing a good thing. We can't let terror win!"
$C: Ajit Pai’s face is too perfect to not be featured in Southpark 
$C: listening to their speeches was horrifying - seeing regulatory capture in action is an affront to every american, regardless of political affiliation. In the back of my mind, I wish that we could throttle and fuck over all websites or things associated with supporters of this repeal.

$C: Ya know, maybe i'm just being emotional since i'm VERY frustrated by all of this, but letters, calls, and voting simply aren't working. These people don't give a single fuck about any of us. They literally do not care if you are even alive or dead. We are a product to them, to be bought and sold, and it's disgusting. I'm sick of it. This isn't a call to violence, but the only way things will change, is if these people in government are afraid. Making them uncomfortable and fearful is, at this point, the only thing that will reverse the course this country is on. These fucks need to be reminded that their job is to represent us. It's not an opportunity to add more zeros to their bank account, it's an opportunity to help the community that elected them. This needs to be dramatically pointed out to them, and if the current course continues, there needs to be consequences. We're rapidly approaching the point of no return, if we're not past it already. 
$C: > It is disappointing that the FCC Chairman plowed ahead with his planned repeal despite all of this public concern, not to mention the objections expressed by his fellow commissioners, the FCC’s own CTO, more than a hundred members of Congress, dozens of senators, and the very builders of the modern internet.


This is what astounds me. At this point, I'm literally yet to hear from anyone who won't profit from a lack of net neutrality, that is in support of it.


This is so clearly a decision influenced by money and backhanders that I fail to see how a "modern" society can allow something like this to happen. I hope and genuinely believe that this will not be allowed to happen when it finally comes down to it, but I still wish and pray for the best.

$C: You can't claim you didn't ignore the comments when you insulted the people who made them and then, in the same sentence, say the comments had no affect on your decision.

Fucking hell
$C: It is time for Google,Apple,Netflix, and any other Internet company worried about NetNeutrality to work with local towns to develop and build a network that will be open, free(from regulations), and accessible to all. There is enough technical talent in most areas that if these companies partnered with town and municipalities they could put Comcast and Verizon out of business in under 10 years. It is time... it would be a boon to small infrastructure businesses and put the big boys on notice..

Time to take those billions and make a difference....

$C: Maybe I'm pessimistic. But how is writing to my government representatives gonna change things?

I'm pretty sure they know 80-90 percent of the US wants net neutrality. 

Sorry if this comes off as negative. I just don't get it
$C: Those two women were todays hero's
$C: As time goes on, it becomes more and more apparent that the public have next to no say in what happens in the world.
$C: Oh great, the internet is going to be a convoluted clusterfuck like trying to get cable channels on my TV. Ignorant corporate shills. Fuck all of 'em.
$C: How can they talk about how Net Neutrality damaged our internet services since it was enacted and restrict future growth? I am living in the same house since I was born and always have had a 300kb/s connection with no improvement or new lines put in or anything. My only two options are ATT's DSL or Uverse or Verizon's ~~FIOS~~ DSL service. All of which are complete and utter shit and have problems daily with. Even the fucking ATT technician said not to get Uverse because we would have more troubles with that than the land line. Your own fucking technician said that. So please Commissioners, tell me how this is going to "improve" my life? The fucking balls you all have to say Net Neutrality is bad. I literally have a second or third world internet connection with no long term improvement in sight. This is why I have considered moving to other countries or states. 

Edit: I reread this post after calming down from watching the FFC's vote and looking at the comments; And I see how this can be confusing to read. For me Net Neutrality really didn't solve anything regarding my internet or speed of service, but I still want the protection(s) it has to offer, among hoping it helps all of you other redditors out with your service. We shouldn't have to fight for what Net Neutrality stands for in this day and country. 
$C: 2 nays 2 yays. Ajit Pai is left and we all know what he's going to say. This is it.

$C: So this is how democracy dies. They heard us - they heard *everyone*. They heard that the majority of us didn't want this, but they simply didn't give a single fuck. I am beyond fed up with this corrupt, tainted country.

***Edit*** addressing some concerns below

Hello, this is the owner of MailMyGov. First of all thanks to u/spez ... the bot is positively beaming :) I think it deserves the weekend off.


Also wanted to address a couple of the comments. Yes places like battleforthenet.com are awesome and amazing and you should use them. So are all the other links in the bot post.
But afaik, they don't let you send a real letter. Our letters are printed out and mailed in house (a deliberate decision for security and privacy) in NYC. Every letter is double-checked to be sure everything is printed, enveloped, stamped and sealed properly. A real human does all of this, and a real human goes to the post office every morning and drops them off. All of this does mean that it's a bit more expensive to get this all done, not to mention payment processing fees, api usage costs, server costs and the overhead. 


Hope this helps, and regardless, the everyone should try their best to organize, inform, advocate and VOTE and we hope MailMyGov can help in some of that.


Cheers! (any feedback is always welcome)

	 
	 

$C: I hope I won't have to look back on today as the day the Internet died.
$C: Millions of texts, calls and emails from citizens can't do shit against millions of dollars from a few companies. This is not democracy. It's fucking disgusting.
$C: Proof right here that we are not a democracy.  We are the Corporate States of America.
$C: I honestly just 100% dislike Ajit Pai. Something about his facial expressions and his attitude just drives me absolutely mad. This dude can rot.
$C: "The internet worked just fine with the old rules."

2 minutes later

"The internet isn't like other utilities. It changes very quickly."

OH, YOU DON'T FUCKING SAY?!
$C: "On the advice of security, we need to take a brief recess"???

The fuck just happened?

E: According to [TheAnonJournal](https://twitter.com/TheAnonJournal?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), someone made a bomb threat.

E2: And it's official: by a vote of 3-2, Net Neutrality dies.
$C: Why is this decision made by only 5 people? Can someone please explain why these 5 people are so qualified to make decisions on major internet regulations? Also do the house and senate not get a vote on this?
$C: The organizations behind Battle For The Net are launching a new campaign to demand that Congress step in and restore net neutrality via Congressional Review Act (CRA).

The CRA let’s our elected officials in Congress overrule actions taken by Federal agencies like the FCC. And it’s different from a normal bill because it only requires a simple majority in the Senate and House to pass. Given the level of public backlash and polls showing that 83% of voters from across the political spectrum oppose the FCC’s plan, and given that several Republicans have already started to publicly criticize the FCC vote, we have a real chance to making this happen. But it won’t be easy, and it can only happen within 60 legislative days of the order going into effect.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

We can’t stop now. Contact your reps today and demand that they preserve net neutrality through Congressional Review Act

You’ll see a script on your screen, or you can say something like this:

***I support Title II net neutrality, and I urge you to use the Congressional Review Act to pass a “resolution of disapproval” reversing the FCC’s December vote to repeal the Open Internet Order.”***

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also text ***BATTLE*** to 384-387 to use a simple chat-bot to send a message to your lawmakers

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
**We can still win this. Even if you’ve already contacted your reps, now is the time to call them again. We need all hands on deck. Please, take a moment and make the call, then spread the word, sticky this post, or help drive traffic to**

$C: He's saying it's unfair for Youtube and Twitter to allow or disallow specific content to appear on their platform, but he's repealing the rules that prevent ISPs from doing the same thing. What the fuck is he talking about?
$C: Seriously, fuck you Ajit Pai

You're a piece of shit
$C: This is unbelievably disgusting. Mentions of "baseless fear-mongering", "false arguments", and "baseless imagination". What a fucking joke.
$C: Uh oh, security threat....
$C: One of the many symptoms of the death of democracy and birth of olgigarcy. 

The will of the people is waved aside as “populist” and “alarmists”. This is a pattern that can seen in the lead up to oligarchy and autocracies through modern history. 
$C: I feel the only way we are going to be heard is to make a severe dent in Verizon, ATT, Comcast, et al's bottom line. They might not hear our voices, but they will hear our dollars or lack thereof.
$C: This is fucking ridiculous. In the wake of average people and congress calling for a delay of vote due to some frankly horrible accusations (fraud and identity theft) they push ahead anyways.

They are obviously bought and paid for corporate shills, they sold us out America. congress needs to take net neutrality and pass laws that only congress can get rid of immediately.
$C: Pai keeps talking about virtual reality bandwidth as though VR uses the internet to send its signals. Just putting it out here how clueless he is about how the internet works/how desperate he is for supporting arguments.

Edit
>Bandwidth for Dual 8K VR

LMFAO he's is definitely both. He's manipulative and an idiot.

Edit 2: Yes, I know he's actually not an idiot and that he's manipulating people. It's just funnier to pretend he's part idiot.
$C: Under a flag of net neutrality I made a point to always pay for the services and content I used to support a free and open internet that was geared towards the consumer. And now?

Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me.

Edit: To the people saying pirating won't work now, the effects won't be immediate and there are ways around it. Local sharing is also a thing.
$C: Shoutout to commissioners Clyburn and Rosenworcel, the only commissioners on the board with balls (and the only women on it lol).
$C: "On advice of security, we need to take a brief recess."
$C: I will never in my life understand these people who are in favor of this repeal. Like, they want government out of their lives, but are perfectly  okay with telecom companies and corporations playing them like a marionette. Serious cognitive dissonance that these people are too stupid to even realize.
$C: British here, but will say this: Repealing free and open net would make companies be greedy, and package. This will be a MAJOR fall for lots of websites that rely on ads and people. 

It can make games die out. If ISPs decide to "service package" games like steam, battle.net etc. Then gaming industry is going to be affected.


tl;dr: Ajit Pai is a cunt.
$C: I can't wait for the 3 letter agencies to not investigate the millions of cases of identity theft.
$C: [America is an oligarchy](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746) and nothing about this is news for those who pay attention. However, this should be a sign clear as day that this beyond all doubt is completely true. 

Let the record show that three Republicans are voting for it, and two Democrats are voting against it. [This is not new either](https://np.reddit.com/r/reactiongifs/comments/7emzll/mrw_when_the_front_page_of_reddit_is_all_pro_net/dq6kitr/).

No party is completely blameless for where we are at this point in our history, but please for the love of god, let this forever dispel the bullshit argument that 'both parties are the same'.  
$C: Why the fuck do five people get to make a decision this big that affects millions of people?
$C: The live stream just showed the vote getting shut down and everyone evacuated for a security threat. 

$C: It's very disappointing that our government chooses to ignore millions of citizens and make a decision against them, but I have hope for the future. I hope that in ISPs becoming shittier, it will create the market need for some disrupter. Be it Elon Musk launching satelites or [some redditer launching their own ISP](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7etu6x/iama_guy_who_setup_a_lowlatency_rural_wireless/) I think people are fed up with Comcast, AT&T, and the rest of the shitshow, and it's only a matter of time before some visionary creates an internet company that actually doesn't screw over their customers. It may take a decade, but my hope is that maybe there will be a non-shitty ISP in the future.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Ajit Pai seems like a massive cunt.

Edit: Thanks for the gold, kind person!
$C: This sucks, it really does.

However this isn't the end of net neutrality. Comcast and other internet providers think that this'll slip under the radar, that after a few months of peace and quiet we will become complacent.

We need to prove them wrong.

Keep contacting our senators, not to stop the FCC, but to approve of a national Net Neutrality LAW. Contact local senators to get state laws. I know Comcast wanted stipulations that there could not be local laws supporting title two net number, but I don't think that got in the final bill.

If there's a court case (which there probably will be) support that.

I know it's hard with no end goal in sight. But never let this become normal. Don't go quietly into that goodnight. Fight all the way. Don't forget net neutrality.
$C: They want to censor the internet next month in my country. Luckily it's democratic here and if 100 000 people sign a petition then we'll have a country wide vote if we want to keep our freedom. I already signed it last month.


Seeing how people in the USA can push through a law that is against the will of the people by paying some senators money just screams capitalism.



Your government is not functioning well. 
$C: Anytime the right brings up "both sides, many sides" show them the voting record. 

The GOP has betrayed us too many times this year alone and no longer deserve to be in office.

$C: Fuck the FCC
$C: "On the advice of security we need to take a brief recess?" What's going on?

Edit: Bomb threat apparently

Edit 2: Police are now searching the FCC building due to a bomb threat

Edit 3: they seem unconcerned, probably about to call the "all clear". I just heard one officer say "we're all good"

Edit 4: all clear, they're coming back in now
$C: >frustrating
>
>disappointing

How about "outrageous" or "unforgivable"? Or "selling out the American people"?
$C: Someone called a bomb threat on the FCC vote.
$C: [removed]
$C: One Nation, under corporate interests, with liberty and justice for those who can afford it.
$C: Thanks for being supportive of the fight, first of all. It is disappointing, but we can still try and make it better instead of complaining. 

It’s troubling that the chairman plowed forward without caring about public concern, it shows the state of people’s priorities when in power. 
$C: I hadn't listened to Ajit speak until now against Net Neutrality. His points are disingenuous and flat out lies.

I hate him.
$C: FCC just now chose to roll back Net Neutrality.

Congratulations Canada, you're now land of the free. 
$C: Stop voting for Republicans.

They don't care about you. They care about money.
$C: Yeah, lets keep pretending emails and calls will work. CLEARLY they don't give 2 shits what people say. Money and only money, talks. Democracy in America is a complete sham. 
$C: Several billionaires are having a collective wank right now.
$C: We need a net neutrality amendment to the constitution! 
$C: I'm sick of living in this world, genuinely. I used to have so many plans, things I wanted to achieve, and every day it feels like this administration is taking another stair off the ladder that would have let me get there. I lost my health care after Trump took office, our taxes are going to go up when we could already barely afford them, and now the internet is going to get a corporate chokehold and my business runs on the internet, so now I don't even know if I'll be able to get my customers to visit my shop without paying extra for the privilege. So I just want to say, Thank you Grandpa Jim for voting to ruin my and all of your other grandchildren's lives, we'll never forget or forgive. 
$C: Welp, we all know how to fix this.

Elect Progressives, get rid of conservatives and those funded by Comcast, Verizon, or other lobbyists.

Elections have consequences. Let's not repeat this in 2018 and 2020.
$C: Serious question: Is it possible to create a new internet?
$C: Is there a list of every congressperson who voted against Net Neutrality so I know who to not vote for next round?
$C: https://www.facebook.com/pg/TheHill/videos/?ref=page_internal

one feed still up. bomb sniffing dogs around it now.
$C: See it would be one thing if there was a significant portion of the population that was (for whatever reason) fighting for the repeal of NN. It would be insane but you'd have to accept "okay, well I guess people wanted this."

But there was ABSOLUTELY NOBODY that wanted this unless they had connections to ISPs. Nobody. Say what you want about Trump, Hillary, whatever. THIS is pure corruption.
$C: It's seems to me that all of the writing to congressmen and posting comments on the FCC's site and other protests are useless. There's only one way to fix this -- with our votes. Vote in every election and vote for candidates who vow to support net neutrality. You're never going to change the minds of any congressman with letters. Forget changing their minds -- we have to change them out for someone else. Don't bother appealing to them. Instead focus on educating and appealing to the voting public. If we want a free and open internet then as a nation we have vote out those that oppose that. Fire the fuckers.
$C: Shift from focusing on Net Neutrality to the removal and humiliation of Ajit Pai. We'll keep having corrupt autocrats trying to pass it every few years if we don't make an example out of him.
$C: Wtf is going on?? Security ordered everyone out of the room? 
$C: We need a lawsuit. I will happily contribute to a fund for said lawsuit. I wrote email, letters (okay, technically postcards), and faxes as well as commenting on the FCC website and what did I accomplish along with millions of other Americans? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. We're beyond the point where letters and calls are effective. They don't care. This is no longer a functioning democracy. It has fallen to corruption and corporate interest. 
$C: The video Pai made is the most cringey thing I’ve seen in my entire life! Let’s hope we can keep net neutrality!
$C: “In the interest of security we need to take a break.”

He knows he’s about to become the most hated man in America. A tough feat. 
$C: This is what happens when you just stomp on the little guy.  We all preach compliance and non-violence...but people feel backed into a corner after a while.

I'm sure someone just phoned in a bomb threat or something 
$C: The shit eating grin on Pai's face after the 3/2 vote... r/punchablefaces
$C: Son of a bitch, rat bastards. Internet access is a utility. Plain and simple. We're completely fucked when federal regulatory agencies are in favor of private sector operations

$C: It is complete BUNK how 5 people can decide the fate of something as huge as this. Measures this large shouldn't be at the will of 5 people...at least bring it to the house or senate where elected officials of the people sit...not some back door committee appointed by whomever is in power.

And how it isn't a conflict of interest to have Pai who is Verizon patsy at the head of this always amazes me.
$C: Yes but have you considered....

$C: Ajit Pai, Michael O'Rielly, and Brendan Carr....This is the legacy you leave you children and your children's children?  It will last longer in history than any sum of money you were paid for this unjust violation of a basic civil right. You allowed this bribery and corruption to change the people of America from human beings to simple products that corporations can simply by and sell.   This generation and the generations after will never let you or your legacy be forgotten. 
$C: Wake-up fellow humans of this counrty. Your vote, has and never will ever matter to the likes of these people. They live in a world where they are above us and look down on us as unintelligent sheep. I along with every single person I could reach out to emailed, called, and everything else for nothing. If this and everything else that is happening without our consent does not open your eyes to how things are now, you are blind. I am from a military family and served with honor and I am beside myself. The blatant we do not care what you say is not only troubling, it is down right scary. So sad were we are headed,
$C: Thanks.  I think us netizens did a great job and everything we could to spread awareness.  And, we can still do more.  This policy certainly isn't set in stone.

I would have liked to see more support from the likes of Google and Netflix.  I see they have some presence, such as [Google's page here](https://www.google.com/takeaction/action/freeandopen/index.html), but it's really quite different from the SOPA and PIPA days.

Do you have any insight into why they haven't been active on this issue?

Long term, creating "fast lanes" is going to hurt the tech startup scene.  I didn't believe Google/Netflix had turned completely greedy until I saw their lack of presence on this issue as compared to SOPA/PIPA.
$C: the hell happened? they took a recess under advice from security?
$C: Wait did the FCC just adjourn for security reasons?
$C: Thank you reddit for everything you did.  That gif of the loading icon really helped!
$C: All title II says is you cannot discriminate. Why would you want to repeal unless you plan on discriminating. I have not seen a good argument as to why it needs to be repealed. It incentivizes investment is the only one that begins to make sense, but they have no data and its like the 3rd argument behind the internet is free so there should be no regulation. I don't see how regulation has hurt the internet.
$C: Woah. I was just watching [the live feed](https://www.cnn.com/specials/live-video-2?adkey=bn) and Ajit Pai was giving his prepared speech, and someone handed him a note and he instructed the room evacuate immediately, saying “Bringing only your bodies” and police walked in the room. Then the feed cut.

Edit: Feed's back on; from other sources, looks like they're sweeping the room with scanners and dogs. 

Moar Edit: They're back in the room with shit-eating grins, of course. Also, it looks like other streams didn't drop out. Didn't mean to be sensationalist.
$C: Holy shit. Did the FCC just clear out due to a threat? Which one of you people placed a call? 
$C: **HOW DO WE AS A PEOPLE INTERRUPT THE LIVES OF OUR CORRUPT PURVEYORS IN THE SAME MANNER THAT THEY PURPOSEFULLY AND VORACIOUSLY INTERRUPT THE LIVES OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY?**

$C: This is why I hate these politician cocksuckers so much. Despite everyone telling him "vro, you are WRONG, don't repeal Net Neutrality" he does it anyway. Anyone who follows blind conviction and doesn't have the guts to admit being wrong is not fit to make any decisions in their own life, let alone the entire fucking country.
$C: I love how out of touch they are. Being condescending as fuck saying the internets for memes and geeks. And not to mention the straight up lying and contradiction. One of them was talking about how we didnt need a public hearing on this case since we had the forum. Right after saying that he didnt care about the forum, dismissing complaints as "simple messages having the same meaning" and then complaining about how they called him mean names. All of this while just ignoring the points the ladies made about how this could very easily get out of hand without regulation. 
$C: Don't forget that it may be possible to [repeal this on the state level](http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/dec/13/washington-will-keep-net-neutrality-in-state-if-fc/) at least.

Definitely not a great solution, especially since states like Alabama that especially need free information probably won't pass it.  But it's a start.
$C: They just stopped the vote because of a security issue
$C: "On advice of security we're going to take a recess"

What's going on? 
$C: Clyburn rocked that shit! A huge thank you to the chairwomen and their statements. <3
$C: There’s a bomb threat now apparently 
$C: A bomb threat has occurred in the FCC hall. The meeting may have been postponed.
$C: It is time for dossiers on every Board member of an ISP to find dirt on them and expose that dirt so that they get replaced until they are pro net neutrality.  Same with politicians as they need to be replaced as well.  We need new leaders in these places that actually know how to create good products as ISPs only know how to price gouge in a sleazy and unfriendly way. 
$C: To quote The Big Short, “This level of corruption is unprecedented even for the government.”
$C: Michael O'Reilly obliviously states "Everybody please take a deep breath - we do not and will not block, throttle or discriminate against lawful content."

Moron - the problem is that you CAN do that now. NOBODY should have that right.
$C: I just called both my senators, I would like to remind people to spent 5 minutes and make these calls.  They said they had other people call regarding this issue, but they are not being flooded by tons of calls regarding this. 

You have to call.  You can't post something on Facebook or upvote stuff on Reddit, the government isn't seeing a wave of outrage at whats happening because not enough of you are calling.

Do it right now.  

The phone systems should be down due to the traffic if we are doing what we need to do.
$C: >It’s also possible that Congress can decide to take up the cause and create strong, enforceable net neutrality rules

good fucking joke
$C: SECURITY BREACH AT FCC MEETING

Watching live. Security interrupted the meeting and rushed everyone out of the room. ~~The mics have been cut.~~ Mics still live with some news outlets (Fox, Politico, CBS [with commentary]). More sources appreciated. No 

Update: People coming back into the room. No word yet on the cause of the security breach.

Update 2: Piece Ashit picks up where he left off.
$C: Whoa, what is happening with the room clearing? 

edit: There is a dog in there... bomb threat maybe?
$C: Security has ordered everybody to evacuate before Ajit Pai could finalize his vote
$C: Around 10 minutes ago they cut the feed and left the room under the urging of security. Does anyone know whats going on yet?
$C: [removed]
$C: Power corrupts.
Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
Your government, my dear Americans, is absolutely corrupt.

Good luck.
$C: My personal belief is that all our work and dedication just pushed them to further their agenda even more. Seeing how much people care gave them fuel to shove it down our throat because they now know how much everyone cares about the Net-Neutrality. 

They have no shame, no personal beliefs, no humanity, no sense of self regulation. All they care about money and power. And now, they know how much power they have and much more money they can sap out of our hard worked pockets. 

The battle is lost but the population can rise togheter and battle the bunch of puppets over there. Go out and vote for the people that care about you instead of voting for "your party". Left and right don't matter anymore, vote for humans, not sock puppets. 
$C: [removed]
$C: Very frustrating. You know what else is frustrating? That probably most people on here have not voted. That's how you get Trump and Pai with 77k votes and they're here to stay. Obama was right - elections have consequences. My frustration is that the people who try to do the right thing and those who don't give a damn suffer those consequences together. We can send this Pai dick letters until all the trees in the world are depleted, it won't matter. What matters is voting so people like this never come to power. 
$C: Riot in the streets. Don't stop until they listen.
$C: Ugh and our shitty Republican congressman that support anything with an R next to it. Elected officials should have to take an exam to check if they qualify for the position, to make SURE they're not retarded but they probably would rig that too.
$C: Says we can't make decisions based on hypotheticals.

2 minutes later

"I think this would have happened."

Go fuck yourself.
$C: Whoa, what's going on?
$C: Something that has been troubling me for a while is the governance of the internet in general. It does not solely belong, nor is it solely used, by the USA in any way, shape or form - in fact it is universally used around the globe. Why, then, is the USA determined to wield such power over it?

My point is that the US should not be the only party with arbitrative power in this scenario. The entire world needs a form of alliance that bears no bias towards a single country or corporation, and a democratic process that allows all countries to vote on issues concerning how the internet works. 

Perhaps, then, it's up to us to spearhead a change that will set this idea in motion. 
$C: NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

THEY. WILL. NOT. GET. AWAY. WITH. THIS!

Screw the 3 votes and the ignorant a-holes who cast them. They need to be voted straight to HELL.
$C: What the fuck is the point of democracy?
$C: Goodbye a free America. All the lower class pay taxes while the rich don't and we have our rights and freedom of speech stripped away by the same rich who don't care and proven they don't care.
$C: This makes me just irate. Vote these GOP scum the hell out of office. This isn't a partisan issue. Only the GOP wants this to happen. Kick these bastards to the curb as soon as possible!
$C: [removed]
$C: I'm sorry, America. It's sad it's come this far.
$C: Remember Net Neutrality the next time someone says Republicans and Democrats are the same.
$C: A shit pai has one of the most punchable faces I've ever seen. A disgrace to America when literally nobody supports the repeal of net neutrality except greedy cunts out to restrict information and make more money.
$C: I WILL MISS YOU MY DEAR AMERICANS. 

Jk, let's not lose hope just yet you sexy people. Ya got this!!
$C: [deleted]
$C: I was gonna say...how can this not be challenged in court? Is an immediate injunction possible in this case? This seems so blatantly counter to protections of free speech. 
$C: Blue Midterm 2018. 
$C: This is really going to fuck up the tech economy of the U.S., particularly for startups. I expect more companies to relocate to here in Canada. Hell, Amazon might even move it's new HQ to a Canadian city next year. 

It's a real damn shame, the U.S. has contributed so much to tech and the internet as a whole, (heck, it's an American invention). Elections have consequences, people. 
$C: Just had the entire hall evacuated
$C: Security just emptied the room and the CNN live feed got cut. O_O
$C: As someone who isn't a US citizen, this is disheartening to see. As bad as it already is for the States, it also gives a huge cop-out to other lawmakers who would like to see this happen in their own countries.

I really hope that the American people don't give up, both for themselves and for the rest of the world.
$C: We now live in a country not of Freedom. We are ignored and tossed aside. The voice of the people fell on deaf ears. The time of protest has passed. Now is the time of revolt. We will not be ignored no more and those who done these transgressions, will be punished by the hammer of consequence.
$C: I do appreciate the two dissenting votes. Wish we could keep an eye on the bank accounts from those three votes that voted aye.
$C: Tell your government representative that because Net Neutrality is dead, come election time, if an ISP backs their competitor they're fucked.  

The ISP can, and will, introduce small stutters to their videos and small load times to their websites.  Who returns to a site after a couple of these experiences?
$C: The only possible reason those 3 could have voted to repeal is because they were paid off.  Absolutely fucking sick.  I feel like the last bit of ethics that our government had went out the window when Trump got elected.  It's like a free for all to screw the American people now with no consequences.  They don't even try to hide it anymore!  edit:fixed a word
$C: This comment may be lost, but;

I propose a universal day of internet darkness. Let's go analog for one day. 

What does this mean?

* Stay off the net for 12 hours
* No games, Netflix, cable, etc.
* use your smartphone as a phone only

Other actions to be considered - cancelling your service.for 12 hours. Mass cancellations would do more to repeal net neutrality than letters, protests, etc.

This is not an easy thing I'm proposing. I am a stone cold Twitter addict with three handles, I touch Reddit at least twice a day. I have two active blogs. All of my stuff is in the cloud. I know it's even tougher for gamers. And then there's porn.

It's going to be hard. But if we go analog for just *one* day, it's a message providers will be helpless to ignore, as they are sure to do with even the most massive ground protest.

New Years Day could work. If you think this is a viable idea, please share it.
$C: Seriously...fuck all these assholes that voted to repeal.  I wish them nothing but the worst in life.
$C: Ajit Pai better go to jail for this.  There has to be a dereliction of duty law somewhere to punish those who capture regulators.
$C: Writing a letter is not going to do a single thing. Letters go to the "Don't give a shit" pile. Those with power and influence know exactly what the people want, but they do the opposite regardless. The majority of the country wants Net Neutrality. What people need to start doing is being aware of who is running for office locally, statewide, and nationally, and vote. And not just vote, but run for office themselves. What people need to start doing is hitting the pockets of corporations. What people need to start doing is marching in the streets and being civilly disobedient. If you're going to write a letter, you say that you aren't taking this shit, and that you are going to show that you aren't taking this shit.
$C: Fuck you Pai.
$C: I am a conservative leaning moderate and I will never vote for a Republican again. Done. This Government is a disgrace and an embarrassment, clearly not conceded what is best for the citizens but corps. They are criminals in the highest order. 
$C: As someone who works for comcast, I can confidently say **most employees disagree with this decision**. The reason you’re not hearing from us is because we are legally not allowed to talk about it or post about it. I’m on LinkedIn looking for a new job as we speak and so are some of my coworkers. 
$C: The vote is TECHNICALLY still happening
$C: Every single person who voted on that, should be removed from office.  Do NOT let those few corporate slaves control our destiny.

Remove their power and remove the corporations from their power by NOT making a single fucking purchase.  Make them wither and suffer and go bankrupt.  

Make every single executive pay for this.  The people who want this, just want to profit from what should be free for all. 

Pool our money together.  Buy our OWN satellites and build our OWN internet.  Let those who want to do us harm, wither and suffer.
$C: NY state attorney General is planning on sueing the fcc

https://twitter.com/AGSchneiderman/status/941370862976012288
$C: So now Comcast, Verizon and AT&T will be making announcements about their upcoming plans to improve upon their infrastructure and technology??? I mean, they stated that Net Neutrality kept them from doing so, but now Net Neutrality is no more. So, surely, they'll have plans in place to invest in these new projects. We've known this was going to happen for at least a month. Where are the plans dickheads?
$C: This is no longer a fight against net neutrality. This has turned into a war against corruption in our "Democracy". Which is sad because we truly don't live in a Democracy. We live in a republic 

A democracy is the people's vote on everything. 

A republic is representatives vote on everything. 

How we built this country was on the foundation of businessmen. Not the common man 


$C: Welp, looks like the FCC just doomed Trump 2020.
$C: The chairman plowed through because he gave no shits about anything other than doing exactly what groups like verizon wanted him to do.  If ever you wanted a prime example of a corporate puppet, there you go.

Maybe we get lucky and he doesn't look before crossing the street.
$C: This was a massive mistake from the GOP.

Verizon just signed their death warrant.
$C: Listening to him open his dumb ass mouth and spew out this bullshit is infuriating. 
$C: Delayed due to security? Afraid people may storm the building?

Personally, I think there should be a full investigation into the bot/disappearing comments, Pai's obvious conflict of interest, and into the history of these telecommunication companies that keep fleecing the American pubic because they have monopolized the most crucial utilities of the modern age.
$C: It still has to go to court, right?
$C: Vote democrat

Get your health care back

Get net neutrality returned
$C: [removed]
$C: 3 people just decided that 323 million of us as Americans don't need to decide what we have full access to on the Internet. Pretty much the entire American population is against this but once again we have gone completely ignored. Seems to be the theme of 2017 as a whole....

And no it's not just about images, social media, and fun. It's about applying for jobs online, access to news and accurate sources of information, disenfranchised groups connecting with others like them, researching & access to medical assistance, an even field for startups & new content creators, and so much more. In short, this is about our modern way of living and keeping it free and accessible to everyone and the FCC have just voted to kill that freedom. 

This ain’t over though. Not by a long shot. Contact Congress and your representatives, everyone. Support and keep an eye on the upcoming lawsuits and court cases coming ESPECIALLY with the the fact that tons of falsified comments were made to the FCC and NOT INVESTIGATED. None of this stands legally and believe me, it's gonna be a messy fight. But it's one we have to win. 
$C: I can’t wait to watch republicans get massacred at the polls next year.

Then I remember Alabama whites overwhelmingly tried to elect the pedophile.

Jesus fucking Christ this nation is a fucking joke.
$C: This is ridiculously bullshitty. Are they gonna make me pay more to play video games??? It's all I have left :(
$C: The vote passed for repeal and as soon as it did, he pulls out his Reeses mug. 
$C: So this is how liberty dies, to thunderous applause.

Thanks for fighting for us, Reddit, and everyone else who has.  
$C: Mark today as the day where we start the real fight for the internet.  Ajit was never going to change his mind from the beginning which is really disappointing.  Our last hope lies with Congress trying to find a middle ground at a minimum since the voter backlash will not bode well.  
$C: While I acknowledge this may be a bit over dramatic, but I can't help but feel like this is a declaration of war against...people. The interests of the people do not matter. I've known it, but I am personally offended not only by their actions on this, but on the fact they've got to the point they could do it with their chests out. Arrogant, obnoxious and wildly disheartening.
$C: When Russia has more internet freedom then the freedom lovin mericans....
$C: I'm looking at the silver lining: The hacker uprising will be expidated by the frustration of the proletariat. 
$C: Here’s a question: Lobbyists are hired by companies to try to make sure the bills they like go into effect and the bills they don’t like die. Why don’t/can’t we build something like that here on Reddit? Sure, it takes a lot of money to do, but there’s a lot of us. I’m not even suggesting taking Reddit’s revenue to do it, because Reddit is not just for Americans. But we could set up a fund that people can donate to, then we could use that money to make sure the important issues are heard from our points of view. 
$C: Security alert????  Oh man...is it a shame I'm kinda happy??
$C:  The FCC just made me a Democrat-leaning independent for life. 
$C: [removed]
$C: Vote just went down, 3-2 in favor.
$C: It's time for a revolution. 
$C: Sad, scary day for Americans. This proves how fucked up our "democracy" is when companies can pay off representatives to hold an opinion. Meanwhile, the 90% of us (the consumers and THE PEOPLE, in which Ajit Pai barely ever even addressed) lose. What other freedoms will we lose since lobbyists literally run this country now while no one in government offices seem to bat an eye about it, not to mention the fraudulent data gathered?
$C: Stop putting republicans in office. 
$C: How about you ban the_dipshit

They are openly against NN and the rules of this site
$C: Advised by security taking a recess?!! 
$C: What just happened?

$C: What’s with them taking a recess for security?

$C: The  FCC meeting on this just got evacuated mid speech by security 
$C: wtf just happened?
$C: They took a recess due to security measures. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Is anyone watching the live feed?  The dogs are out with the police.  Something is happening.
$C: WTF just happened with the FCC live video? Terrorist threat?
$C: Holy shit they evacuated.
$C: So the FCC won't let us be.
$C: Ajit Pai = a shit pie
$C: It was a pleasure working with you all. 
$C: I know the names of my state's congressmen who supported Pai, and I know when the next election is. Don't get too comfortable, gentlemen. 
$C: [removed]
$C: Press F to pay respects 
$C: Ajit Pai is a traitor to the American people.
$C: Fuck you fcc.

Ajit Pai too, that fucking cunt.
$C: Fuck you, Ajit Pai. Choke on a cow dick.
$C: Get of your fat ignorant asses and get that revolution started.
Letters emails and voting Don't work.

$C: The saddest part is if Bernie were President he would shut this shit down asap. Trump I guess doesn't give a fuck. The United States is the best country to live in if you enjoy having your politicians fuck you over daily for their own benefits. Fuck our government fuck Pai.
$C: The Conservatives destroy net neutrality but Reddit blames Ajit Pai. Is Reddit too scared to call out Republicans? 

This is why Reddit let's r/the_donald get away with half the shit they do. They are too afraid to take sides and lose profit.
$C: Screw the FCC and screw Congress. We need a constitutional convention on this matter. Make net neutrality a fucking unrepealable amendment.
$C: Well I'm not saying it's time to grab the torches and pitchforks but I'm on my way to the hardware store... seriously it's time us normal citizens take our country back even if that means by a forceful take over. Elections are failing us, politicians gerrymander to make sure they get the vote they need. We need to make a stand. 
$C: This just proves that sitting around gets nothing done and complaining on the internet gets nothing done if you wanted to stop net neutrality from being repealed there should have been a bunch of people at the FCC headquarters ready to drag pie out of there. It's time we start taking more actions against these people instead of just letting things happen
$C: This is what you get for voting republican. 

On behalf of everyone that uses the internet, fuck you. 
$C: O'Rielly is a sub human piece of garbage. 
$C: I’m honestly surprised Ajit Hasn’t been assassinated yet 
$C: The Information Age is over. The Internet will become pay-to-access and over 99% of all websites will be blocked or throttled. [This](https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4252153/what-is-net-neutrality-isp-package-diagram.0.jpg) is our future. Make no mistake, this *will* happen. Prepare now. Here’s a brief list of things you need to do ASAP. This list should not be considered exhaustive:

1. Get at least [two external hard drives](https://www.lifewire.com/best-external-hard-drives-4050413), but you may need even more depending on how much you need to download. You are going to download EVERYTHING on the Internet that’s even remotely important to you and back it up. You will likely spend at least $150-$200 on this, but it will pay enormously to have the peace of mind.

2. [Get every single bit of personal information off NOW!](https://www.lifewire.com/remove-personal-information-from-internet-3482691) Anything you store on “the cloud” like Flickr or Google Drive, you need to get off immediately. You will likely not be able to access it later. A brief list of sites to scrub would include: family photo albums, banking/financial information, social media accounts, any shopping sites or anything that has your credit card information such as Amazon, etc. Download anything you can think of to your external hard drives, back it up, and delete it from the Internet as best as you’re able.

3. Upload NOTHING to the Internet from here on out that you might want to take down later. You can lose access to any website at any time. This is how you must use the new post-Information Age Internet from now on.

4. Start downloading any websites or things of interest that you use. Especially small personal sites or obscure webpages. Remember, you can’t assume that search engines will turn up any sites you want. In fact, you can’t assume search engines will even be around anymore. What is there to search for when 99% of the Internet is blocked? You’ll have a small list of sites that your ISP offers and that’s it. A good first start is [Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download) It’s not perfect, but it’s one of the best sources for general knowledge available. The file size isn’t as big as you might expect (though still big at around 20 GBs) because it’s mostly text. Update this every month or so, especially if your ISP makes noises about throttling or blocking it. Download an offline version of a mapping service like Google Earth or Maps and update it frequently as well.

5. Download any porn you like to watch. Yes, your porn is definitely in danger. No ISP wants to be seen “supporting” porn so they will likely block this before anything else.

6. Start pirating any music, movies, tv shows, games, etc, that you enjoy. Whatever your prior feelings were about piracy, fuck them. Your Internet is about to die and your access to everything you enjoy as well. Internet piracy is about to be a thing of the past anyway, so indulge yourself now while you can. Alternatively, you could buy everything to download, but that just seems ridiculous in light of the fact that your Internet prices are going to go up to access the exact same shit you did before. Think of it as debt that you’ll make up by paying at least 50-250 extra dollars a month for the rest of your life. A little “piracy” seems justified to me.

7. If you have an online business, I honestly don’t know what the fuck to tell you, except to offer my condolences that your livelihood is about to be stripped away. You should be in survival mode right now. Keep in mind that different ISPs will support and block different sites. You could be blocked on one, throttled on another, and have the fast lane on another. Either way, you will very likely lose business unless you bribe most of the ISPs. We’ll find out details in the coming months and years on exactly how they’ll fuck over small businesses. For now, just breathe. This likely won’t happen all at once, so you have some time to get your affairs in order. Brick and mortar stores that the Internet replaced will likely start to make a comeback, so if you can, start thinking about making a transition.

8. [Get a VPN](https://www.lifewire.com/reasons-to-use-a-vpn-for-private-web-browsing-2483583) and learn how to use it. This will likely be made illegal in the near future, but for now, this is your last line of defense against the ISPs. Even here, don’t upload anything you want to take down later. There are free ones, but a good one will run you some dollars per month, but it’s still cheaper than the prices you’ll soon start paying for Internet, and you’ll have access to everything you did before, albeit much slower. You don’t have to use this for everything (yet), but you at least need to be familiar with it.

9. Stay informed. Here’s a brief list of sites that support Net Neutrality: https://www.battleforthenet.com/. https://www.savetheinternet.com/. https://www.publicknowledge.org/. https://dearfcc.org/. http://www.theopeninter.net/. Don’t expect these to stay up forever. You may consider downloading any relevant information from them. Keep in mind that throttling and blocking will likely happen slowly at first. The ISPs will be very tricky and in many cases, it may even start out imperceptibly. If a frog is put into cool water that slowly heats up, it will die before it knows what happened, whereas it will jump out if the water immediately switches to boiling. I suspect this is the strategy the majority of the ISPs will take. It will happen gradually over many months and years until we slowly accept the new restricted Internet. This is the main reason to remain very aware of exactly what the ISPs are doing and to call bullshit on every single thing, even if it initially seems minor.

10. Stay vigilant. Even now, this isn’t over. The majority of America is with us, and public outrage will bring those numbers even higher. This is a fight that at least we have strong public support for. Start campaigning, keep calling your representatives, keep the discussion alive everywhere on the Internet before they block it. Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.
$C: well riots are gonna happen soon. good job ~~restricting~~ restoring internet freedom. Hope verizons cock tasted good. 
$C: This is a fucking joke. Imagine being a public servant, and then calling the publics concerns "outlandish and absurd".

$C: It has been a week and so far I have seen no comment from reddit on reddit regarding your strategic partnership with a company called Sprinklr.com.

I find it thoroughly amusing that reddit would [announce their partnership with sprinklr on twitter](https://mashable.com/2017/12/07/reddit-sprinklr-sold-its-soul-to-brand-engagement-customer-care/) but not on reddit itself. Nothing on /r/blog or /r/announcements yet.

#In conclusion,

#I find reddit hypocritical to be beating the net neutrality drum, while behind our backs you guys are selling our meta-data to third parties and encouraging brands to astroturf reddit.

$C: Congrats to everyone fucking one of you who had voted for the orange turd that put us in this mess.
NN is on it's last legs and possibly dead....
We live in a age where facts are false and opinions are real.
I don't even fucking know while typing this....such a unbelievable fuck up.
You guys say fight but be fucking honest,you think this will change in our lifetimes?
The power to manipulate information and the ability to charge the poor out of the market is a horrifying aspect.
At the very least climate change will assure than this corporate dystopia will not last long.
$C: Fucking lmao, American Democracy is so fucking flawed. Shit like this starts revolutions. Fuck this administration. Fuck the corporations. Fuck my life.

I’m sick and tired of holding my un-lubed asshole open for the telecom companies to just shove their corporate cocks in whenever they want, no one in America wants this. Fuck this country.

I can’t believe that these corrupt fucking cunts just went and did this despite the will of the majority of the American people.

How the fuck can a democracy ignore the people? If this happens, are we even a democracy? Like seriously, someone fucking explain what the hell just happened and why is it allowed to happen!

In the wise words of Frank from IASIP, “SOMEBODY’S GOTTA GET STABBED!!!”

Edit: IM JUST SO FUCKING PISSED RIGHT NOW. CHAIRMAN “I SHIT PIE” SHOULD BE TRIED FOR TREASON! THERE IS NO OTHER WAY!

Edit 2: I want to fucking die! 
$C: Ajit pai is a asshole 
$C: SECURITY HAS ADVISED ME TO LEAVE

holy shit
$C: It's simple.

If you want Net Neutrality, vote Democratic. 

Never vote Republican. As you see with Pai, they don't care no matter how much you yell.
$C: [removed]
$C: [removed]
$C: Keep fighting.
$C: Well, Internet. It was fun while it lasted. Interested to see the new you at least. 
$C: Wait so does that mean we lost? :(
$C: Ohhh shit!
$C: Hopefully it'll be a permanent recess
$C: The cameras are still rolling and they just brought in bomb sniffing dogs it looks like .

$C: Did they just get swatted???
$C: They put a bomb threat on the meeting, thanks 4chan
$C: The guys who were laughing and trying to make this seem like a dumb situation to worry about are frightening. Laughing at taking away rights..
$C: did anyone watch "the hill" live stream? 
it kept rolling through the evacuation and bomb squad sweep.

$C: Wait did the vote pass?
$C: ..Did someone just swat the FCC?
$C: [Butthead](https://imgur.com/LOBuXv8)
$C: RIP
$C: Welp, time to become Amish.
$C: Such bullshit. They don't give a fuck about our voices.
$C: [Meanwhile in the UK...](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/latest/media/media-releases/2017/automatic-compensation)
$C: Another example of officials choosing corporate greed over the people. I’d be more angry if I wasn’t so used to it. 
$C: More horrors from trump
$C: Honestly, I think the best way to hurt them is their wallets. Move business away from Verizon. 

Keep voting, sure. That's very important. But if the money stops the panic sets in. 
$C: Idiots voting for Republicans. Muh regulations
$C: Fuck ajit pai 
$C: This what voting Republican gets you... 
$C: [removed]
$C: So literally nothing everyone did mattered. Public opinion < money 
$C: Someone already doxed him lol
$C: Fuck these assholes
$C: I can’t believe how these people are allowed to hold office even thought they have clearly gone against the will of the population. Time for a change. 
$C: FCC is the new EA
$C: I paid $3.99 to write this comment
$C: We're never going to get away from this issue as a whole if we keep deflecting it. Now that it's here, we can start reacting to it and working towards an actual solution such as how Washington state wants to put laws in place to prevent ISP bullshit. We're going to eventually infrastructure around current ISP's, and they are going to end up being worse off than they think they are right now. Their greed will be the end of them.
$C: #Conservative #republicans killed #NetNeutrality.
No one else did. 
You're doing a disservice to the American people by not pointing this out.
$C: We need violence in the streets, thats the only time they will listen to us. Hold our country hostage. Fuck this bs, stand up like a real american and assassinate Pai. These are legitament answers to very serious problems but no one is willing to band together to actually fight. Instead, we watch the government fail us, and then expect them to fix it. It's  absurd. 
Im not talking about punching old ladies, more burning down these buisnesses and specific peoples homes and holding a public execution for Pai to show warning to future leaders who seek monitary gain from the common citizen., and manipulate our laws for money, who allow murdering/rapist cops go, ect. 
I know its a far cry, and extreme but i feel its time for extreme. 78%of the nation was against this and yet they ignored us. When will it be too much? What do they habe to take for it to be riot-worthy? When will the people stand up for themselves? 
$C: I've also been trying to spread the news about this in my country. You never know when other governemnts will do the same...
$C: I'm angry. Very. Fucking. Angry.
$C: America you need to fucking do this. There are only so many emails i can write from outside of the country. Its up to you guys to make sure this gets stopped. Figure it out.
$C: Ajit Pai compares ISPs with content providers. I don't think he understands the difference between the network layer and the application layer.
$C: Fuck you Republicans. 
$C: Ajit Pai is a terrorist straight up. 
$C: wait, you yanks are fucked then?
$C: How the fuck can 3 people have this much power? Our system is so messed up.
$C: Any regular US citizen that considers themselves part of the REpublic party going into 2018 doesn't have a brain in their head. 

They need to reevaluate what it is exactly they think they are conserving. BBQs, guns, and jesus doesn't count. 
$C: Writing to reps won't change anything. Democracy has failed. We need major political upheaval. 
$C: [deleted]
$C:  This is how democracy dies
$C: This means war.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I hope everyone over in T_D is happy and celebrating right now. This shit is squarely on them and the candidate they support, but it is going to come back and bite everyone of them squarely in the ass
$C: On one hand I'm worried about the people in the United States losing net neutrality and thus becoming the playground of these greedy corporations. On the other hand I'm glad my country is part of the European Union, and for the existence of European regulations that basically makes the loss of Net Neutrality nowadays simply not possible in my continent. I really hope that USA can get out of this dark period as soon as possible. Hopefully once Mister Trump is out of the Oval office. To those who have fought so much for net neutrality I say, do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed. Bad times may come. But the bad times have not come to stay, they have come to pass. Don't lose your hope, nor your will to fight for what is rightfully yours. You deserve better than to simply let it all end like this. 

Thank you so much, everyone.

$C: Hopefully this is a motivator, not a paralytic, for Americans.
$C: No, its over. The GOP controls all three branches of the government. The 1/3 of the country that votes straight R get more representation that the rest.
$C: We didn't do it, Reddit...
$C: Can someone just explain to me if I will have to start paying for this shit or not? We lost? How long will this shit take to go into effect 
$C: If this does quickly go to court, can these new rules be enforced in the meantime, or will it all be put on hold until the court case is finished?
$C: Best of luck in your fight.

~The rest of the World 
$C: Fuck those corporate sell-outs.
$C: Even tho i'm european and none of this will hit me. I wish all of you guys on the other side of the ocean good luck with defeating those darn bastards! 
$C: This can't be normal ?
$C: ....They are being evacuated.
$C: Wow someone called security measurements something happened
..
$C: *slacktivism
$C: **They Live**
$C: I wish i believed there was a special place in hell for sellouts like Mr. fucktard Pie.
$C: We need Net Neutrality! Please show your support in this ongoing issue!
$C: wait so did it get repealed or not?
$C: I wish somebody would give him some of Granny's peach tea. 
$C: RIP the internet..
$C: “And this how democracy dies...with thunderous applause...”
$C: The supporters of the repeal like harking about how these telecom companies wouldn't do the things we're all claiming they would (even though theres proof they've done it in the past) because they would face a mass exodus of customers. **It is not about what the telecom companies will or won't do, but making sure they're aware of what they CAN'T do.**
$C: [deleted]
$C: This whole situation is depressing
$C: This is sickening. I hope there will be a change in the way this country is run in the next decade or so. Wishful thinking but I'm sadly, still hopeful. 
$C: how likely is that this is going to get overturned?
$C: America truly is great again. /s
$C: Looked up pai's wife to see if I had more of a reason to dislike the guy but thank fuck she isn't hot. 
$C: Indeed I thought this was a government made for the people by the people. 
$C: America the land of the not so free anymore
$C: I thought this was a democracy? I saw 83% of people do not support this. How the fuck can they just do this?
$C: A government for the people, by the people. Apparently not.
$C: fuck ajit pai
$C: Fuck Ajit Pai
$C: FCC should proceed to light their headquarters on fire so we dont have to do it for them
$C: Lol aren’t you the guy censoring us?
$C: God, our government is such shit. 
$C: START DOWNLOADING ALL THE PORN
$C: :(

$C: How long will Appeals Courts process take?
$C: Solution: Cancel your ISP/Cable. Just fucking do it. If enough of us do it the companies may hear us.

Also someone start work now on networking technology based on quantum entanglement. 
$C: How long until ISP’s can take advantage of the new rules? 
$C: Just a question about the issue. Will ISP’s actually be able to charge for the use of certain sites? Also, are there any instances where this happened before 2015? Don’t mean to take a side here, I’m just honestly wondering. 
$C: Ajit Pai, you have failed this City.
$C: Goodbye republican party, after this shit they are going to be losing elections left and right.
$C: Trump supporters handed the internet over to Corporations. 
$C: Press F to pay respects
$C: When do the riots start, and where do I sign up?
$C: As someone living in the UK, I'm concerned about the same thing happening over here. Is there anything I can do to help support you guys across the pond? I can always cheer here! :)

$C: Is there any chance of the shitbag Ajit Pai potentially facing any jail/prison time for this assuming it does go to court?
$C: I hope the republican government destroys the internet.  It's the only thing that will get certain people to wake up to what they really want to do to this country.
$C: Can we collectively sue the FCC and ajit pai for obstruction of Justice by not releasing the records of who sent in comments even after the court ordered them to?  Could that be used to repeal the law? if not repeal, can we sue Ajit Pai till he's dead broke and begging in the streets? I'm not a rich man, but I'd donate $1,000+ to that cause.
$C: Awwwwwwwww, poor spez.  Don't edit my post spez!
$C: Is there a way to filter out anything that says net neutrality on my Reddit front page?
$C: If you cared about an open internet you'd removed Mods ability to lock threads. That shit is abused regularly to keep any dissenting views. If a thread starts getting comments outside of the mods views it's locked.

Please spare me your open internet bullshit when you clearly don't give a fuck.
$C: Let's just all move to the dark web. Fuck FCC.
$C: Fuck Ajit Pai and fuck the Republicans that supported this.
$C: Extremely  disappointing that our government chooses to ignore millions of citizens and make a decision against them. Over 25 Million comments to the FCC, Internet Uproar  and 4 People have the ability to decided this?
"These people don't give a single fuck about any of us"
$C: The man deserves the worst this world has to offer. Taking away the freedom and rights of millions. Being a Canadian from Saskatchewan our shit is far from perfect, but I’m so sorry you guys down south have to go through this shit because of the greedy fucks in power in the states. They can fuck right off and eat some melted dick cheese. 
$C: My God... they will sell your soul and skin if they have the chance. I lost every grain of trust that a US government entity can work FOR the people. It's just not happening. Money is more important than people, the planet, anything really, it seems.
$C: Is there a big protest? Can we do something in reaction? I've never protested in my life, but I'm down to yell at people
$C: "WE SHOULD HAVE A LEVEL PLAYING 
FIELD AND LET CONSUMERS DECIDE 
TO PREVAIL." - Ajit Pai. I have never heard such contradictory words. 
$C: The battle is expected to now move to courts, with various activist groups filing lawsuits. What are the chances of this changing anything?
$C: How could the whole board not acknowledge the massive internet uproar? No one wants this except the cooperate cucks that don't want neutrality, WE DONT WANT TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT WE DONT HAVE TO PAY FOR. Wasn't America built on the opportunity and heartfelt love for freedom? So then why are they trying to repeal this? I honestly feel like this is unconstitutional.. I am appalled.
$C: Dec. 14, 2017... the day the internet died. 
$C: I'm at a loss for words. Let's hope they all get royally fucked in court.
$C: Remember when the Donald said Hillary would kill net neutrality, I remember
$C: Thanks Trump supporters.  You goddamn fucking piece of shit idiots.  For the hundredth time this year:  you all can get fucked!

Maybe you’ll get that trickle down internet from the corporations though!   

Fucking dumbass morons.
$C: How the shit does one asshole have so much power that everyone can be against him, and he can just go ahead and do it anyway? I don’t get it.
$C: Turns out "emails and calls" are the new "thoughts and prayers".  Neither really do a damn thing.

Sad day.
$C: Can we get rid of The Donald now? They are selling a completely OPPOSITE story about this than everyone else in the world right now. 
$C: Also send Mr. Pai friendly letters of disappointment. At his home.
$C: You **bastards.** Oh this is going to fuck with my SWTOR subscription for sure. 
$C: One step closer to Big Brother it seems.
$C: i'm moving to switzerland and buying some prairie dogs 
$C: There it is. RIP NN.
$C: Well they just voted....predictably...I'll be over in /r/drunk 
$C: >we're not done fighting

Give it a week.
$C: One person shouldn’t be able to fuck 300 million like this. This is disgusting. 
$C: They'll pay for this.
$C: As an American, I am regularly ashamed of my country and its leaders :/
$C: Don't worry guys, Pai will probably be dead within a week anyways. 
$C: So I have an actual question.

Why can't the people vote on this? Why is it up to only 5 people to vote for the future of the internet?
$C: Sometimes nothing is the answer. Give them nothing. Suck it up and go wthout internet for a while. Take millions of customers from them. Make them lose billions. "The customer is always right"
$C: Two Democrats voted to keep it. Three Republicans voted to overturn it. 

All you fuckers that stayed home last year. All you idiots who say there's no difference between the parties... hope you're happy. 
$C: /u/spez do you know something we don't? I can't find announcement of the decision anywhere...
$C: Pls no Pai
$C: Dont give up guys! Not over yet! 
$C: The name Ajit Pai will go down in infamy.
$C: Just called my
Reps office to tell them to support bill h.r 4585 to save net neutrality
$C: So.. realistically, what is the next thing we can do? feeling bummed out :/
$C: While I can still say this without being censored or paying a $20 fee, Ajit Pai is a major cunt
$C: what can people out of the USA do to help? I live in Canada and I feel helpless. :(
$C: I want to fall off of a cliff now.
$C: They keep referring to how the internet will just be like it was before 2015 (the year in which Net Neutrality rules were put into effect).  Can anyone explain (or provide a link with a good resource) exactly how was the internet back then?  They keep saying how the internet was fine and dandy and these rules were never needed.   I know enough to know that they’re full of shit and that we definitely want to keep Net Neutrality rules and I’ve been trying to do my part, but I would like to know how ISPs “behaved” prior to 2015’s legislation.  Thanks. 

$C: Can you alter the thumbnail so that the fist is hitting Pai in his stupid fucking face?
$C: 2018 Americans, do it. And make Pai pay for it.
$C: Anonymous, we need you!
$C: woah what? they are taking a break because security told them they have to?
$C: What just happened??  "On the advice of security, we need to take a brief recess"???
$C: [deleted]
$C: This sucks. I hate this so much. People are going to get affected, someone is probably doing to die from it (one way or another), and it's gonna be terrible. There is one glimmer in my opinion, and that's one ISP that isn't stupid and keeps their internet the same. I hope to that it's comcast or something, but that's very unlikely. We just gotta hope.

$C: the live feed is shut down..people are being escorted to a safe area
$C: They just shut down the stream due to a “security risk” or something.
$C: Did they officially vote? Security just made them pause. 12:50PM EST.
$C: Shut down reddit for a week, see what happens. And twitter. And facebook. And amazon.

If any of you cared this would be fixed.
$C: The FCC is voting right now as I post. Go watch it live here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMNuNxpxnSI


It saddens me that politicians put companies and money over consumers.
$C: was there a bomb threat?
$C: Was watching live when pai was interrupted due to security concerns 
$C: Wait wait wait, so is it official? Did they really vote to repeal it? I’m not 100% up to date, I was in class. 
$C: This stream is still rolling guys! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d_202l55LU 
$C: When the First is gone , remember to use the Second. 
$C: The vote already happened? I thought its currently 2-2 according to the live feed?

https://www.reddit.com/live/103wk34e8cnvd
$C: Sad to see American democracy working in this fashion. They do what they want to their corporate overlords. We see this all over the world and seemingly few governments stand up for the people.
$C: Live stream here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d_202l55LU they are using a dog to sniff around. I heard one officer say that they got a call that a bomb will explode in 15 minutes, but I am not sure. 
$C: So much for a democracy! 
$C: It's the camera that's still streaming! That's the threat!! Get it!!!
$C: F
$C: Yeah the Washington Post feed is still up. 
$C: Does anyone know/ have a link to what the argument is against net neutrality? I feel like the people pushing to defeat it must have some argument, however flawed it may be, other than "Big ISPs are lining our pockets to do this".
$C: I believe they just had some sort of threat called in, Pai was handed a note and said they needed to take a "brief recess on advice of security"......


https://youtu.be/Rw_udfbMp8Y?t=2h17m15s
$C: The FCC hearing was just evacuated on the live stream.
$C: Im just so sad
$C: How do these people live with themselves!

Edit - I think were live again. 
$C: Wait can someone please tell me what happened.
$C: Wtf is going on?? Security ordered everyone out of the room?


$C: We need street protests so they can’t claim all the protests online were fake..assholes
$C: So I am assuming that someone called in a bomb threat to have the room cleared out. 
$C: Oh shit they had to clear the room due to a bomb threat
$C: The USA is well and truly fucked.  What are you doing to yourselves?  
$C: There isn't a vote when conservatives are in office, it's all about money and who pads their wallet with bribes and backstabbing everyone they can to make more money than they need.
$C: photoshop a dick on ajit pai's face.
$C: They are actively hindering the progress of our very own species for their own gain.

This is high treason against humanity in my eyes.
$C: In the mean time, time to call for Ajit Pai's resignation?


$C: So, overthrowing the government happening when?
$C: Ah fuck, they're back.
$C: > update2 (9:55AM pst): While the vote has not technically happened,

do you mean legally?
$C: Why was chat disabled on the stream?
$C: What are these immoral motherfuckers going to vote to take away next?  Transportation? Food?  Water?  
$C: So when do the riots start? 
$C: It's amazing how people can somehow still believe that they can beat the rich by playing by their rules.
$C: It happened, 2 no, 3 yes, the repeal has passed. I’d recommend filtering into top comments and q&a to get some better insight on what happens from here. 
$C: I feel like the system of a government that represents the population failed today...
$C: Confirmation that you can buy anything you want in this world. Even the US government. 
$C: And so liberty falls, to the sound of checks being cashed. 
$C: Can someone explain to me when all this will take place? How long until we have to pay for things like reddit and twitter?
$C: So did it actually get voted on? I’m seeing the news saying it was called off for security reasons or it’s a done deal.

Good luck USA 
$C: This is the way the internet ends. Not with a bang but a whimper.
$C: I used to feel bad he got doxxed...used to
$C: It could not be any plainer that phone calls and emails don't work
$C: Burn the motherfucker down.
$C: What was that quote about democracy dying in the dark? I can’t look it up on the internet. 
$C: What will happen is nothing will change for a while, so the FCC and big companies (verizon) can say "see its the same stop worrying." Then slowly but surely they will creep in extra costs with the hope no one will notice.
$C: [Read this post for only $4.99](http://verizon.com/broadband/packages/reddit/)
$C: Why hasn’t someone hacked the republican fcc commissioner’s personal info and put them on blast yet!!!!
$C: This is nowhere to be seen on foxnews.com

$C: If you are a Verizon customer today, you should not be one tomorrow.
$C: Their stupid little jokes trying to diminish the impact of the decision. Fuck you, Pai.
$C: So what can we do now...?
$C: r/Queen_Rosenworcel/
$C: Has anyone tried getting your lovely president to take to Twitter about it? 
$C: What comes next is getting a law passed that supercedes the regulators so this isn't at the whim of a bureaucrat.
$C: I think they should bring back public executions and chop pai's head off for treason
$C: Why doesn't Congress, you know, pass a law taking the power away from the FCC? If the internet is a utility, then the FCC has no jurisdiction over it anyway.
$C: F
$C: How many times does this sort of thing have to happen before we realize that petitioning doesn't work. The system won't be reformed, so revolt.
$C: The lesson this year is not to vote Republican, ever.  Even if they are a great person, they will toe the party line and vote with republicans. 
$C: Fuck those assholes, what's the point of a democracy if all they do is cater to the corporations. I'm fed up with this bullshit and I hope that everyone that is affected by this (meaning everyone) votes democrat next term.
$C: i feel sick.

$C: This is a tragic loss. But this is also an opportunity to stand together. We need to cooperate and unite.

Restore net neutrality!
$C: lets move to eu
$C: Done fighting for this. It doesn't matter how many people oppose it to their representatives or call or text, the government won't listen to us. Such a waste of time. 
$C: We need Mr.Robot
$C: Im abit confused. Does this mean you guys will have to start paying extra for internet or not?
$C: So they were paid by isp super pacs? Why couldn't the tech giants, google Apple Microsoft make their own and buy their votes for net neutrality?
$C: This is what elections are for. Voters and non-voters really dropped the ball here, on their own feet in 2016. 


$C: We don't have money so we don't get to make policy. They have money enough to make policy and laugh at us.

$C: #FUCK ~~PAO~~ PAI!
$C: Everyone should email <a.shit.pie@fcc.gov> saying "Thank you for your well considered vote.
$C: Why write to Pai? Or anyone inside the FCC? They CLEARLY don't care what the American people say. They in fact steal identities to post comments to support this repeal. 

I have written to local and federal government trying to do my part. Write them. Maybe they will start to listen. Fuck the FCC as a whole. Writing them is a waste of time until the FCC is gutted and the people who run it currently are sacked or what have you. Writing them is like asking ISIS to listen and stop their acts.

$C: I saw the vote, is it official now? Has net neutrality been erased just like that or will there be another meeting? If it has been repealed then what can I, what can WE do now?
$C: Hi-Ho, Hi-Ho, it's off to court we go!
$C: That. Rat. Bastard.
$C: Dear lord they're leaking Ajit Pai's address all over Twitter. It's on.
$C: Dear Trump voters, 

Your man who was supposed to drain the swamp installed a man, Pai, who literally surpressed the opinions of the voters and then repealled net neutrality because he got money from the telecom complanies. 

How do you defend this?
$C: This is a step backwards for us, and the majority are getting screwed.. Can we get a post about what the Repeal of Net Neutrality fully entails? 
$C: I’ll never understand why I was taught that the United States government  is “For the people, by the people”... it’s clear this was a lie 
$C: Rip
$C: That's it, corporations fully own us now.
$C: What the fuck
$C: [deleted]
$C: im dont know much about net neutrality but who decided that 5 people can choose to abolish net neutrality or keep it? 
$C: Not even from the U.S. but I’m absolutely sickened by this decision, and the derision which Pai and his cronies have treated the views of the public they are supposed to serve.

A cowardly act. A dark, dark day.
$C: DDOS of FCC Next on the agenda 
$C: My heart is broken.
$C: *laughing in european*
$C: 80% of Americans were against this. And yest a 3-2 vote can take away everything you hold dear. Try to remember that in the coming revolution.
$C: Remember this the next time someone tells you both parties are the same. There's one party that voted to end net neutrality and one party that opposes net neutrality and it's the Republicans. So if you really care about it vote them out of office and vote for a person that cares about net neutrality. Doesn't matter if they're Republican or Democrat, although at this point it's fairly obvious which party actually wants net neutrality. 
$C: I am losing faith in humanity. I actually believed this would never happen... Corrupt assholes. 
$C: I have witnessed the birth and the death of the internet. 
$C: Pai should be charged with treason. This is more damaging to the country and its people than anything that's happened in my life. 
$C: Welp if the internet starts sucking dick, I'm going to vote with my wallet, and stop paying for the shit, and I suggest you do the same, because the only fucking vote that matters in America is the money, now. 
$C: Lets Protest this decision by flooding Ajit's twitter with gay porn. He has to pay for the straight package!
$C: I hope Republicans know that they’re fucked next election...
$C: Ajit Pai I sincerely hope you are harassed wherever you go. I hope you don't get a moment's peace and are boo'd out of any place you go in public. You are literal human excrement.
$C: Oh look the rich capitalist fucks getting what they want in a capitalist society.  HOW SURPRISING.

$C: Very excited about this result. I can't wait. 
$C: Why are people giving Spez gold? That's like mailing your paycheck back to the federal reserve
$C: fuck spez
$C: I'm sick of living in this world, genuinely. I used to have so many plans, things I wanted to achieve, and every day it feels like this administration is taking another stair off the ladder that would have let me get there. I lost my health care after Trump took office, our taxes are going to go up when we could already barely afford them, and now the internet is going to get a corporate chokehold and my business runs on the internet, so now I don't even know if I'll be able to get my customers to visit my shop without paying extra for the privilege. So I just want to say, Thank you Grandpa Jimothy for voting to ruin my and all of your other grandchildren's lives, we'll never forget or forgive.

$C: Delete The_Donald you fucking coward
$C: Why do five rich folks on a bench get to decide what we do with our internet? 
$C: Go on americans! Fight back! Full support from Italy!
$C: Seems like most governors on the east coast do not want this bill to pass, and are fighting against it.Im glad that some part of the legislative branch will actually fight for our internet freedom!
$C: And apparently there was a bomb/death threat.  Pai just had a note handed to him and they immediately began clearing the room for "security purposes".

Nobody should be hurt or killed over things like this.  That being said, I hope he IS investigated and if found guilty of crimes, is locked up for a long time.  
$C: [removed]
$C: Good luck US! I really hope y’all will win this fight!
$C: I got to ask...how soon can companies implement the concerns we had? I would assume they would have had this stuff ready to go with the flick of a switch as soon as the vote happened.
$C: The only person with any sense on the board are the women, more proof that we need more capable women in positions of power
$C: Donald Trump ~~put Ajit Pai in the FCC~~ made Ajit Pai the chairman of the FCC. Frankly, if you really want to save net neutrality, you cannot vote for Trump in 2020. If Trump is replaced by someone who cares about the internet, then even if the legal challenges against the FCC's decisions are ineffective, the next FCC chairman will reinstate net neutrality before too much damage is done. But I truly fear that if Trump is reelected, then the internet as we know it is done for.
$C: Step 1) don't elect Republicans. 
$C: Ajit Pai, Republican appointed to FCC chairman, originally appointed as an FCC commissioner by the Democrats (In 2011, Pai was then nominated for a Republican Party position on the Federal Communications Commission by President Barack Obama at the recommendation of Minority leader Mitch McConnell of all people, bad move imo).	
Brendan Carr, Republican and republican appointed.
Michael O'Rielly, Republican and Democrat appointed.

What do these 3 FCC commissioners also have in common? They all voted to repeal Net Neutrality today. The two Democrat commissioners, Jessica Rosenworcel and Mignon Clyburn, voted to uphold.  You have the be dumb as sin or rich and amoral to vote for Republicans at this point. Stop pretending both sides are the same and do a modicum of research.

4. Either service is fine to sell phone service.

I've seen far too many people saying their goodbyes assuming the FCC vote on #NetNeutrality is the end-all - be-all.  It's not.  If they vote to repeal, they still have to go to court to defend their choice. Spread this! NN has been discussed in court before.  We won.  Twice.
$C: Someone bomb-threat-ed the FCC. Stay classy, internet.

$C: Is his speech contradicting his stand? So these companies already partake in similar practices we fear to happen? Take away the regulation and it'll get better?? What?
$C: Everyone download TOR browser now if you haven't already lol.
$C: shocker of a vote...congress isn't gonna do shit other than keep taking some corporations money....what a clown show our govt. is turning into
$C: But isn't this better than having crooked Hillary? /s
$C: Way to go, Trump voters! You did it!
$C: Bottom line - does this mean less porn or more porn?
$C: the lack of media coverage outside of reddit was nowhere to be seen and that was beyond disappointing.  Americans are just so fucking dense nowadays
$C: what would it take to permanently protect NN so the FCC can't keep trying to get rid of it. Would adding NN to the charter of human rights work?
$C: can we get Pai address and fill his yard with burning bags of shit?
$C: Hey Trump supports, remember this day. The people's champion fails again to do anything that helps average citizens.
$C: For fucks sake America, vote those slimey cunts OUT! The rest of the world is begging you. Don't let the governments of other countries follow your lead.
$C: this country is a cesspool. i’m ashamed to live here 
$C: [deleted]
$C: I'm 💯 for net neutrality, but reading this thread, and the general toxicity and almost hatred level biases is really disheartening, people trying to twist it back and forth to their other political stances.  To those of you putting out valuable links and information, my hats off to you, to the rest of you that don't seem to realize that compromise and progress are found in the middle, not on the left, or on the right, and that neither side is better or even remotely interested in serving your desires, I just hope you start paying attention to the whole picture sooner, rather than later.
$C: Can we begin by revolting now. All this peaceful protest is bullshit, we will always lose if we choose to sit down Indian style and sing hey Jude. We're fucking American cocksuckers grab your monkey and go out there and get real change 
$C: Until the FCC is disbanded and Title II removed - you're going to have this.

Competition needs to be in place for regulations to hold - otherwise it's 'oops, guess we'll just pay that fine! Not like you can hurt us financially since you need us or you can't use the internet!' They have to lose more than they gain from their misconduct, and the only way you can do it is competition. Up the fine, they up the cost of service, because *there's no alternative*.

Remember: **Comcast and Verizon rose to power on the backs of the FCC under Title II. Not in spite of it. They have not been 'left alone', they literally have been making the laws and stacking the FCC with their lobbyists for decades. They are doing precisely what the law says for them to do, because they wrote the regulations - there's no congress. Just executive authority that can be lobbied.**


Rewrite the law. Remove utility regulation from the executive branch and place it solely within a congressional piece of law that is difficult to change (remember how SOPA/PIPA etc failed? Yeah, you can bet cable companies lobbied Obama hard to switch title II on so they could get around the telecommunications act entirely, knowing they had allies in the wings regarding the enforcement of title II rules).

Everyone has made this partisan, but it's not. It's about the cable lobby strategically donating HUGE sums of money to alternating candidates to create a perform storm scenario. This is called regulatory capture.

This is where, no matter how progressive you are, deregulation comes into play along with trust busting. 

Edit: I've gotten a bunch of downvotes and comments from folks going "BUT REPUBLICANS": https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000022131

Your candidate, Hillary Clinton, was to nominate Pai as the chairman and was the #1 donated to from telecoms in 2016 as a single candidate. The only other person to get paid more by the telecom lobby was Barack Obama. They did not donate to Trump.

They donated to every republican congressman, packing the republican senate and house committees with as much cash as they threw at Clinton. It's called playing both sides against the middle. That's you. The emotional, tribal voter who can be easily swayed by *billion dollar corporations with 20 year plans and trillions at stake*. This isn't some knee jerk party for them like you are all treating it - they have TEAMS of people dedicated to manipulating you, the voter, to giving the corporation what it wants.

Edit2: in response to the 'blue' copypasta about "see ebil republicans!" that show votes, I present this:

http://time.com/money/4237383/hillary-clinton-big-cable-lobby-money/

https://www.mediaite.com/online/telecom-giants-have-overwhelmingly-donated-to-hillary-clinton/

https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?ind=B09

It's called buying a split party congress/white house to push your agenda through. It's the most risk-adverse way to get what you want over a long-term. This could easily be Trump and the democrats, the telecoms just found republican congressmen and Obama/Hillary were the most willing. Otherwise they would have given money to Trump and the democrats.


Also, telling republicans "I'll never vote for you" makes them not care about whatever you care about. It also makes democrat candidates care less about what you want because it's not like you're going to vote republican. So knock that stupid shit off, it only plays into Comcast's hands.
$C: Ajit Pai's original opening line," The intent is to provide our internet users with a sense of pride and accomplishment..."
$C: And the internet is dead
$C: We live in a sad world where people are willing to throw away freedom and net neutrality just to gloat at reddit mods. 

Disgusting, inhumane, childish and sad.
$C: I hope Pai, O'Rielly, and Carr get dick cancer.
$C: **THEY FAKED THE MOTHERFUCKIN' COMMENTS**. NOT ONLY SHOULD NN BE PROTECTED. BUT ALL THESE CUCKS SHOULD BE PROSECUTED.
$C: **VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT.

VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT. VOTE DEMOCRAT.**

$C: And even if it didn't pass, we'd be back here again, in three or six months, fighting for this AGAIN.  

Pai is so deep in the pocket of his owners, he's halfway to Narnia.
$C: The irony for Spez to say he is fighting for a free and open internet, when he locks dissenting voices away on Reddit and bans certain subs for committing thought crimes is not lost on me.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I keep saying that he needs to be brought up on treason for putting Americans in a dangerous place.
$C: [deleted]
$C: This is infuriating. Gee, I wonder what's going to happen when the people no longer have the power to say what happens in their government.  

I wonder when CEOs and politicians are all going to invest in private security, they're going to need it with the path this country is heading.
$C: Dear Ajit Pai,

This fight is not over. You will be challenged by congress, the states, and the courts, and you will lose. I know that 78% of the internet agrees with me when I say this.

Fuck you Ajit Pai
$C: $10 the bomb threat cancels the vote and will have to be redone a few months from now. Hate to say it but I’m happy for the delay of the bomb threat...
$C: Ironic? More like moronic. This guy is so backwards I think he may actually have his head further up his shitter than a dump.
$C: Damn, I cannot believe this is happening to you guys, my sympathy for you guys. I really hope this doesnt infect Europe, I would be very angry.
$C: The vote has just passed officially. We all knew it was coming, but still disappointed.
$C: I don't understand how this vote work. Why are only the 4 person on the FCC seats voting? Where's the rest of the congressman?
$C: Talk to your friends, family, and acquaintances. Explain the issue in terms that are important to them. You are most uniquely suited for doing that. Be kind, don't be argumentative. Create a ground swell of support OUTSIDE of reddit.  

Then we try again, but with real numbers, not just reddit. Shared outrage is easily catalyzed into action (how bout that senate vote in alabama?). The problem is the outrage is NOT shared as far as reddit thinks.
$C: They just raped us we said no and they forced it on us. goodbye freedom of speech on the internet. If you complain about the FCC or ISP's on a website you created your going to get shut down.
$C: Fuck Ajit Pai
$C: If we don't take to the streets in this very moment we will lose our momentum and never take back the rights that were stripped away in this moment.
$C: Serious question: So if I was a gazillionaire, could I start up my own cable/internet company, not throttle down or charge extra, and totally screw all the other cable/internet companies? 
$C: All your words and letters get sent to an overworked underpaid person just like yourself and they get sent into the garbage. If words mattered they would have stopped this. THEY DONT MATTER TAKE TO THE STREETS OR GET READY TO GET ALL OF OUR RIGHTS STRIPPED.
$C: Non American here, ye're democracy is fucked 
$C: Ajit pai is a cuck
$C: Just a reminder that **Trump voters brought us to this point**. This is on all those who support Trump.
$C: Fuck Republicans and their apologist supporters. Every time there's a criticism pointed at the GOP regarding the NN issue, some right wing cock slobber starts screeching about how the GOP is pro NN and the Dems are just as bad. The voting record says it all, you morons.
$C: Quick tip to whoever is running for the next election, if you actively work to bring the free and open internet back you have my vote
$C: THESE MOTHERFUCKERS WILL NOT WIN.

WE CAN'T LET THEM WIN.
$C: Where are the Anonymous when we need them? 
$C: Hope you're happy republicans.

This is on you. 
$C: Am I the only person who feels like the whole "Social Network Package, +$10/mo" type messaging we've been seeing is kind of dishonest?

Net Neutrality regulations weren't adopted until 2015, and if I recall correctly, ISPs weren't doing anything like that from 1991-2015, at least not that I ever noticed. I realize that the repeal of certain government regulations concerning the internet would make it *legal* for that sort of thing to happen, but plenty of  practices that businesses could employ are *legal*. That doesn't mean that they do it.

My company *could* jack up our prices 15% overnight and start adding weird fees for random stuff, but we don't do that because it would be stupid and we'd lose customers. We don't need government regulation telling us we can't. I understand that ISPs have less competition than most businesses, but this still seems kind of misleading.

The Simpsons' [Bear Patrol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm2W0sq9ddU) bit comes to mind.
$C: I bet a lot of the people saying "violence is the answer" are a bunch of Russian trolls. Last thing we need is more violence. 

We should be able to make their lives miserable some other way. Violence is not the answer. 
$C: Good job Trumpies and /r/the_donald for helping these guys get their way finally.  Now America can start helping small business thrive... uh in the rest of the world I guess I mean you Americans are boned.

/downvotes will cost $1
$C: you could have saved yourself the trouble and voted for Hillary
$C: America is not a democracy its an oligarchy, this is not what the people want its what the rich want.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Can we ban t_d now since they are sooo against nn and reddit supporting it in general?
$C: Heres Ajit's Home address so we can mail him letters right to his door Arlington, VA old dominion dr. 4868
$C: Dear Redditors:

Can we **finally** cut the bullshit that Democrats and Republicans are the same and equally corrupt? Both Dem-appointed FCC members voted against erasing Net Neutrality.

Almost every issue you care about, Republicans are against your position. They fight tooth and nail to eliminate any good policy that benefits “We the People” instead of “corporations are people, my friend”

Get off your asses and vote **for the Democratic Party** and you will start to see us climb back from this dark time. National Republicans funded child molester Roy Moore’s campaign. I’m sick and tired of milquetoast idiots saying “oh, it’s not all Republicans”.

Actually **yes the fuck it is!** Vote for Democrats every single fucking election, or else all the whining in the world won’t do a damn thing.
$C: Rest in peace, net neutrality.
$C: RIP torrents
$C: I COULD be wrong...but so far, Mike, Brendan, and now this lady (idk her name) are all PRO Net Neutrality.....isn't this a REALLY good thing? What am I missing here?
$C: Can someone just protest outside there blasting Eminem's "Without Me" (with the line "So the FCC won't let me beOr let me be me, so let me seeThey try to shut me down on MTV") 


$C: This is all just attrition warfare to the FCC... Disgusting...
$C: I hope you guys from the US get this right and get the chance to have a free and open Internet.  

~~ with love from Europe.
$C: I dont know what else we can do. It feels like all our work as a people is for nothing. Feels hopeless!
$C: Text 384-387 "BATTLE" and the bot will help you message your local congressional representative! tell them "I support net neutrality and demand you support a congressional review act resolution to nullify today's fcc vote, and save net neutrality"!!!!!!
$C: Shouldn't all net neutrality be a almost unchangeable amendment?
$C: deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.5640  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/41942)
$C: We won't use internet anymore in the future. We will use meshnet of $skycoin developers. It is like vpn internet 2.0. Educate yourself. Escape the system.
$C: Just keep writing your representatives, it'll work this time! Oh, and don't look up the definition of insanity...
$C: I hope your country riots in protest 
$C: so what does this mean now exactly?  When would the ISPs be able to implement their new regulations that they are going to kill us with?
$C: How could those two jackasses sit there and vote aye after Clyburn gave her speech? How could all that outreach and senator calling and effort do nothing to change just /one/ of those commissioner's minds? I am fucking boggled.
$C: Well ain't that some shit
$C: I saw much of this "but the internet was just fine before 2015, blah blah blah" it almost looked like it was a script people were posting

$C: Guys I understand it may have a slight affect, but really what will writing to congressmen even do? Realistically what affect can a bunch of people have in this situation
$C: i live in australia, is there anything i can do? 

i went on exchange for 5 months to indiana, and i still know the address of the house i lived in. could i write as an american and use that address?

$C: So much for Democracy...
$C: So how would I go about challenging this in court?
$C: I'm scared

$C: Trump is gonna be piss when he learns he can't watch free porn without buying the gentleman package from comcast.
$C: I've been following the live stream. They haven't even made the vote yet

EDIT: https://www.fcc.gov/general/live

EDIT 2: NOW we're fucked
$C: :( rip net neutrality 
$C: Anyone hoping this also affects Isis so Isis can blow that Fuckface up?
$C: Where were you the day the internet died? 
$C: What happened? 
$C: 11:49 AM, not sure how the lag for the stream is, apparently recess on advice from security. 

Any ideas on what that is?
$C: im not from US, but i want to thank all of you for fighting!
$C: Ajit Pai-ce of shit can go royally fuck himself
$C: Did they just have a security breach?!
$C: They just had to evacuate the conference due to security concerns.
$C: As disappointing and disgusting as this  year has been, this is the nail in coffin. I feel so upset and yet we as individuals have zero power over this. The hope I had is fading. What the fuck are you doing USA? 
$C: Fuck i wanna see whats happening. I hope the stream doesnt cut off
$C: These guys were basically mocking the wishes of the American people. It was disgusting.
$C: Does this recess mean that we won? jk
$C: So. FYI Reddit, as someone out of your country of origin, I am not buying a Reddit package, etc. Bye bye. 
$C: So now that’s we don’t have those protections anymore, what happens next? Can our state (thank god I live in NY) pass protections for people in NY? 
$C: The blatant lies are the worst things.
It pisses me off to no end that everyone is getting lied to about one of out aspects that dominates our lives! 
Do they think we're fucking stupid?
$C: Quick question: What will happen if your website gets blacklisted? As in: We'll have to pay to get to reddit?
$C: WTF is it over? I’ve been watching the livestream and no vote hasn’t been called yet
$C: Those doggos just wanted to play with each other
$C: A list of members if Congress who supported the repeal (and estimated donations from Telecoms corps).

Tell each one what you think, maybe ask them how they spent all that cash!

$C: What a $urpri$e
$C: IT'S TREASON THEN! EXECUTE ORDER 66
$C: So what happens now, is that it? Is this the end or does it now have to go through congress? Or does congress get to make an amendment to block this? What can we do?
$C: Lol American government not listening to it's people. 
$C: Would it be possible to crowdfund a non-profit ISP to have community-first priorities? 
$C: The commisioners got security to retrieve their cell phones while everyone else had to abandon everything.
$C: Can someone compile all of the jokes from the hearing so we can all chuckle along with these monsters as our protections go the way of the turd.

Also: I'm watching WP feed still. Do they always security sweep with dogs for recess? 
$C: Break out the pitchforks and torches. Looks like that's the only language they'll understand.
$C: When do we take the streets? 
$C: Way to go, America.
$C: Bomb sniffing dogs?

Someone literally trying to "drain the swamp" again?
$C: The bad guys won a long time ago
$C: "delayed for security reasons"  IE I can believe that many death and or bomb threats have come in recent days.     
$C: Does that mean we are screwed? Does this affect Canada?
$C: Man fuck him and his stupid ass mug. 
$C: Thought these American lot liked freedom? Obviously not when it comes to the internet. Sorry 'murica. 
$C: Vote is delayed. Security advised that people evacuate.
$C: Fuck 
$C: Did he just say that the internet is NOT a series of tubes??
$C: I am European and I live in France. What can I do about this? 

The CEO of orange, one of the 4 big telecom company in France, already said he strongly agreed about net neutrality abortion. What can I do? Medias here don't seem very concerned about it. I want to change things, but I am not American.
$C: "We were acting on the advice of security, now back to your regularly scheduled ass fucking."
$C: HE WILL NOT DIVIDE US!
$C: I think everyone here has a certain responsibility to be active and try their absolute best.
however the outcome, it will not only concern your country but it surely will also influence the rest of the world, viewed as a precedential case.
good luck though
$C: https://www.fcc.gov/general/live
$C: i’m kind of lost. Was the FCC passed? Delayed? 
$C: So honest question... We know there's a lot of money from companies trying to buy these votes. What keeps someone on the "good" side, who has lots of moneys, (let's say Bill Gates), from "buying" his own congressmen or whomever, to vote no?
$C: Looks like there's a security situation right now. Ghost town!
[https://i.imgur.com/VyWpOUo.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/VyWpOUo.jpg)
$C: so the silver lining is this doesn't take effect for awhile, and meanwhile there'll be challenges, and the possibility of these people being voted out, whike this sucks massive donkey balls, its no time to become complacent and move on, keep up the good fight, and we'll get through this 
$C: Why haven't Google, Facebook, Netflix, Hulu, and practically every media conglomerate vying for a media presence via the Internet been as vocal as the grass-roots communities? Do they stand to profit from NN ending too?
$C: I thought this time it would end like the other times they threaten net neutrality.
$C: We need to know more about the three that voted for this and work hard to have them removed and make them accountable in any way we can. 
$C: can someone tell me what’s happening and if it’s looking good? thansk
$C: Its not even my country but i got unbelievable pissed seeing the stream. I hope people will go on the streets for this i know i would.
$C: Is there anything that can be done on a state level?  For example, California has regulations on how much living space chickens must have if you want to sell their eggs in California... but because California is such a big market, many farms follow the regulations despite not being in CA.
$C: [deleted]
$C: fuck fuck fuck fuck
$C: So... Did we lose? 
$C: If you think the FCC cares about public opinion on this matter, I've got a bridge for sale you might like. 

This thing has been decided behind closed doors with hands and wallets wide open. 
$C: There it goes. 3-2. Game Over.
$C: It just goes to show that though we contact our reps and we collectively ask them to support us, they tell us to stick it. I find the process useless, which is precisely what they want us to think. 
$C: Well fuck, I guess this is my last reddit post before I have to pay! sick
$C: I wanted to hit him in the face so badly when Pai had that smirk about voting yes.
$C: Dumb question, but what does writing anyone on the board or in gov’t do at this point? They all know what Net Neutrality is and their stance on it by now.
$C: RIP Lit Fam
$C: its kind of ironic seeing billion dollars corporations begging for public support to protect their bottom line while fucking their users in every possible way they can. 
$C: We truly live in the darkest of times.
$C: Hopefully we can take things back. 
$C: Whelp, looks like I need to get out my AOL keywords again.
$C: Buy $SUB! Change the world! Decentralize the internet!   [](http://substratum.net)
$C: This is such a shame, I can't believe this.
$C: What happens now? 
$C: Ya still think people have the willingness to take what they want? I want to be optimistic but some Americans are just gonna accept their demise
$C: RIP
$C: So it was confirmed to be repealed?
$C: This is fucking bullshit. 
$C: Fuck
$C: This is corporate authoritarianism. Nothing else.
$C: Honest question. If this was not contested in court, when would these laws go into effect? 
$C: I am sad. I hope things turn out for the better because if it doesn't you're going to have a lot of people who used to sit at their computer all day get up and take a stand for what they believe in.
$C: [deleted]
$C: We're fucked.
$C: So now that Net Neutrality has been repealed does the internet die immediately or will it take a couple of hours or days even?
$C: [deleted]
$C: It was a good run guys.
$C: this is stressing me out more than my finals 
$C: Damnit shit pie! Ruining our country hundreds of bribes at a time
$C: Great, the internet was nice while it lasted.  I guess we're going to get throttled to high hell, pay even more, and have an even worse internet experience thanks to our corrupt government taking it up the ass from big corporations.  

Fucking bullshit, fuck you you Reeses cup drinking mother fucker.
$C: rip
$C: Ajit pai can suck a dick!
$C: Well, stock up on single player games. Was fun going on Reddit while it lasted. Hope the ones who were against net neutrality don't get re elected. Was a good fight internet
$C: Well, it's time to crash Canada's immigration servers again...
$C: Fuck
$C: We the people must stand up against such blatant, corrupt, and the complete disregard of the people by corporate owned politicians.  Enough is enough!  Hit them where it hurts the most citizens of the World!  They don't own us, will not own us!
$C: I am not standing for this. We need to eliminate this threat, Reddit, let us wage a metaphorical war on internet tyranny! Let's get these FUCKS OUT OF HERE!
$C: How do I register for the midterms?  Who do we vote out?
$C: What happens now then? Very curious watching this unfold as a European. Is that the end of it?
$C: What do you think will happen when this goes to court?
$C: Just try to stay calm and be optimistic, folks.
$C: Gentleman, it's been an honor.
$C: This message has been blocked. Please contact your ISP to upgrade your internet package to view this message.

Yeah, this is real life now.
$C: Remember America, you *asked* for this.
$C: The internet remembers 
Avenge net neutrality by hating ATT and Verizon 

What are my options to change services?
$C: This is what we get with protest votes.
$C: That's it? You guys aren't going to get off your asses and protest? From real men to keyboard warriors, oh how the mighty have fallen.

$C: How could these people that are representing US be allowed to do this? It's shameful to represent false truths and lead us in this way. These "reps" need to be dealt with accordingly and removed from office.

I firmly believe that the future rests on the internet and this will only set our current progress backwards. How are people supposed to progress when we're limited on what we can do? If anything the limits should be removed like the movements for people's rights are doing. I see the internet as being similar in issue to gay marriage. It restricts our rights without any particularly good reason.

I'm honestly fearful of the future with our current representatives in the world. It feels like there are two powers, one that is pushing forward, and the other maliciously backpedaling the rest of us. 
$C: Unless we make a scene like the ladies who got raped by the rich. We will not be able to win. The FCC is raping us and the only way to show our emotions is by taking to the streets and not sitting behind keyboard like fake justice warriors 
$C: 2017 ending in 2017 fashion. Complete shit.
$C: Disappointed but not surprised, I hope that Pai and the FCC gets fucked and the fight for net neutrality is still not over. 
$C: So THAT is what it feels like to get fucked in the ass sideways with a pine cone...
$C: Fuck Ajit Pai
$C: The vote was a result of corrupted cock suckers. You want freedom? Do to them what was done to the british!
$C: I love you Reddit, but I can barely afford internet now. I'll miss you guys when its all over. 
$C: Nothing will change unless the FCC and congressional representatives fear for their physical safety.
$C: Can we please get Jessica Rosenworcel as the head of the commission? She really knew the will of the people and knew the corruption that was behind this. She said what we all have been saying for months. 
$C: Let the riots begin !
$C: Too bad it wasn't a big deal enough of an issue to actually protest. It was only reddit complaining worthy to most people apparently
$C: He just has those dick sucking lips. It's so... Frustrating to see his punchable face.
$C: Why the fuck is the FCC able to make such an impactful decision all on its own? That alone is a massive issue that needs to be adressed.  The internet isn't a toy. 
$C: Time to buy and invest in some VPNs
$C: We need to make this a Trump issue. It's not gaining proper traction otherwise. And thus happened under his admin and his appointment to chair. 

Need a bug name to focus on. 
$C: We need to take action. Writing letters and phone calls didn't do shit for us.
$C: Is it now a good idea to get into programming?
$C: How the fuck do 5 fucking people get to decide how millions of internet users are able to use it? This is so fucked.
$C: We the people, In order to form a more perfect union, Establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, Provide for the common defense, Promote the general welfare and Secure the blessings of liberty To ourselves and our posterity Do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. 
$C: This sucks. Thanks to everyone who fought and protested. 
$C: So this is how democracy dies, with thunderous protest! 
We will not yield! We’ll get them in the courts! 
$C: What's the point, our government doesn't care about us anymore and never did or will again. 
$C: Oh well, my interest to work and live in the US has plummeted in the recent years. This is just another nail in the coffin.
$C: They fought so hard against Bernie because he had socialist ideas...but when they have socialist ideas everything is fine...my god, wtf is wrong with this country?
$C: We gotta keep spreading the word and stay angry about their decision. This can’t die here. Talk about this shit at every dinner, every Uber ride, grocery store, fender bender, stranger in an alley, doesn’t matter where more people need to know about this! Outside of reddit the general population doesn’t feel like they can do anything. The government of the people, for the people, and by the people at some point has to listen to their people (aka the over 80% of Americans who support net neutrality)
$C: fuck any of you assholes that make less than 100K a year and voted red across the board
$C: can someone tell me if i should be worried about this in UK pls
$C: Fuck these people. Theres nothing we can do to stop them. We can call, email, fax, and write to them and at the  end of the day they will do whatever the fuck they want.
$C: I wonder when ya'll are gonna learn your emails, letters, calls don't do anything.

This isn't a democracy. Stop acting like it is.
$C: I’m sad about the outcome but like you said, we still have time to fight. I don’t plan on giving up and I’m so proud to be apart of such a great community. 
$C: gg
$C: Remember, there’s a chance Congress will eat this shit up
$C: Does " We the people" mean nothing anymore? Majority has spoken and been ignored. Writing letters and emails that are ignored are not cutting it anymore for me.  I will make sure to be in the streets to make my voice heard and count. I am fired up and will make it my goal to hold those responsible for this insanity accountable and voted out as the self serving fucks they are. 
$C: Who all can file suit against the fcc regarding net neutrality?
$C: What are the benefits of no net neutrality if you don't mind me asking? 
$C: Question: How soon will policies of ISPs change if the situation does not change? What major changes will we be seeing in the near future?
$C: But what about the porn?!
$C: Man the FCC won’t let me be
$C: You don't need a weatherman, to know which way the wind blows.
$C: Man this is fucking wack 
$C: Wankers.

Wankers wankers wankers wankers wankers wankers **WANKERS!!!**
$C: Just search repeatedly for, "Ajit Pai pedophile," so google suggests it to anyone who simply types, "A."
$C: My questions is why can they still got away with the repeal.

They represent the voice of people, and if people aren't happy then they have no right to force it down our throat. Or think that their 'opinion' is valid because they hold the power. 

It's like they **BREACHED** the very principle of democracy...This is not democracy anymore.
$C: While I don't agree with Michael O'Rielly voting decision, I do agree on one thing. Name call or cussing them out does not help at all. It's a waste of their time as they're not going to take that letter / email / comment seriously and it's a waste of the writer's time. 
$C: GIVE ME BACK MY NET NEUTRALITY
 
$C: Shouldn’t have voted for Trump and given the republicans the three branches of gouvernement.
$C: It just goes to show how little normal people matter to politicians and how little we can actually do. Sure this can be fixed later, but the point was that we didn't want this happening at all. Net Neutrality will likely come back, but it will happen because senators and house reps want to stay in power, not because they care about the people.
$C: I am fucking heartbroken. This country needs to be over. 
$C: This reminds me of the whole "this is how Bernie can still win" hope
$C: This is frustrating as hell. Why won't they listen!
$C: And this is exactly why there are so many disenchanted voters who simply don’t vote on anything anymore. Our voice doesn’t matter in the slightest.
$C: The Trump-controlled FCC and the entire Trump administration is of big business, by big business and for big business. Everybody else gets screwed and to pretend otherwise is a sad, sick joke.
$C: So which one of you called in the bomb threat?
$C: People need to know THIS THOT WAS APPOINTED BY TRUMP. Ain’t no 2nd term for him, never was, but even his supports don’t support this shit.......TRASH
$C: So, when will the Vigilantes bring us all justice?
$C: Lol usa

NSFW MEME
$C: I would like to leave this here, as a relic to my grandkids. That, I was here for this day fighting until the end.
$C: Don't stop fighting. 
$C: Pisses me off this dude was hand picked by our President. Not saying this is Trump's fault but i want them both out. When you combine business and politics there is always going to be an issue. Ajit Pai is a damn pawn who doesn't care about the people
$C: I don't mean to be morbid and i intend no violence against anyone, but does anyone else feel as if by next week Pai is going to get 2016'd?
$C: Good luck guys.
$C: Well, I hope Mr. Pai and his associates are proud of themselves and the no-doubt massive stacks of money behind all of this, because if they are very lucky, the worst thing that will happen to them is that history will remember them as villains and sellouts who tried to kill the internet. I somehow doubt this will stick, but it's still massively disappointing.
$C: [how I feel right now being a voting citizen in this country](https://i.imgur.com/UjZ3ZCb.gif)
$C: Time to download the internet. 
$C: Who are the people who got to vote? I've looked for that with no success but we need those people confronted directly.
$C: Remember a day, when the internet was *free*? 
$C: Something I often say: information is not power, control of information is power.

I hope you Ladies and Gents over in the States get this fixed, and that it doesn't cause issues for those of us in other countries too
$C: The entire Conservative party voted against net neutrality but we are supposed to pretend that this is about the world vs Ajit Pai and not a partisan issue.
$C: Today is sad and everything seems hopeless.
$C: I get downvotes because I state the fact that voting matters? That shows the issue - Entitlement. 

We vote for this purpose. You don’t always get a voice. Your representatives are your voice. And just because the powers in charge are not doing exactly what you want doesn’t mean you are being “raped.” It means they were voted in and they are doing there job. Vote them out next time.
$C: Could someone fill me in on what happened during the vote? Don’t feel like sitting through a 3 hour log video.
$C: Fucking bullshit
$C: Wait, so the internet is over!?
$C: With all this taking place, I think that it is important to say this.

While this is something that we all need to be fighting for, Please remember that at the end of the day threatening someone is not acceptable. Do not threaten to end someones life, LET ALONE THEIR FAMILIES, over this matter. 

If you want to be taken seriously, be a grown adult, speak your piece and move on. Do not threaten someones kin, you just look pathetic then.

I cant say this enough, you are no worst than them when you make threats. 
$C: #ThanksTrump 
$C: Can anyone explain to me how the ISP's and the FCC believe repealing net neutrality will foster innovation and investment? Are they expecting an increase in revenue which they could reinvest? Or do they claim the repeal will foster competition which may spur innovation/investment? Or something else?

I'm trying to understand their point of view and give them the benefit of the doubt it's not all just to screw us over.
$C: ELI5 what this means as of now, do we  now have to pay to watch YouTube?
$C: Here's the thing, as long as the fate of NN is in the hands of the FCC, what good is calling reps, etc?  It plainly appears that I've been calling and emailing, like I'm the pissing in the wind.
$C: This truly breaks my heart.  
$C: If this isn't the thing that gets this whole country in an uproar about political issues then I don't know what will. I'm so sick and tired of feeling like protesting doesn't do a damn thing.
$C: > organic takeovers
$C: Bossman do mad ting you get me
$C: welp. time to end it. net neutrality is dead and im going the same way
$C: Fully expecting a "please add Reddit.com to your bundle" popup in 3... 2... 1...
$C: I fond it oddly suspicious that Ajit got donations from the companies that would benefit from the repeal -__- 
$C: Ajit, do you want a revolt? Because this is how you get a revolt.
$C: USA banana republic.
$C: Fuck an Ajit Pai
$C: Upvoting posts on Reddit doesn’t accomplish anything, that’s really the only thing 90% of the people even did that speak out against this on Reddit.

There wasn’t a doubt in my mind this was going to happen, nobody really did anything other than press those upvote buttons thinking that they were doing something. 
$C: What's left to do, OP? We're fucked, right?
$C: Ken Calvert and Mimi Walters of of California. I just checked these two scum bags out. Time to get them out. 
$C: does anyone else remember paying extra to access certain websites and content before 2015?

I don't. 
$C: question from european.


Have there been any proper ( and calm! ) protests in USA in 
 defense of NN? Because I certainly can't find any, all I can find is just couple of people standing on the street.


And if no, why?


When that ACTA shit was going on here in europe we had protests across whole europe with thousands and thousands people attending.


All "what to do" advices I see regarding NN is just "write to your representatives" all over the internet but from my point of view that looks just about as useful as doing nothing.
$C: Tony Stark: “How do we cope with something like that?”


Steve Rogers: “Together.” 


Tony Stark: “We’ll lose.” 


Steve Rogers: “Then we’ll do that together too.”
$C: Let's vote to repeal the FCC.
$C: Hey guys lets go to Somalia and become pirates!

With a yo ho ho! And a trickyladydoo! Somalian pirates we!
$C: Man, this nation just can't stop fucking up. USAUASAUSA
$C: Is there going to be a major protest organized in DC?
$C: Just donated to the EFF. Fuck this asshole Ajit Pai. I rarley get involved in politics but this WILL affect my livelyhood!
$C: Inception was a such a good movie.

Please tell me I'm still dreaming.  Where's my totem..
$C: Please pay $5 to view this post.
$C: who are the 3?  What are their names?
$C: Remember folks, the current people in charge of the FCC can be removed by the next president who could then reinstate net neutrality.  We may have lost the battle, but they screwed themselves in the war.
$C: When can we expects ISPs to make changes now?
$C: How the hell can 5 people control something that hundreds of millions of people use every single day? Something about that seems completely broken and backwards. 
$C: This is probably one of the biggest "Fuck You" to middle class America moves ever. There was an incredible amount of opposition to this, both internally at the FCC and externally from the customers that the FCC is supposed to protect.

The idea that this one corporate shill can make such sweeping deregulation happen with a simple majority vote (of a board of 5 people, no less) is disgusting.
$C: Stupid Indian cunt 
$C: According to the Eastern Europeans on /r/the_donald, this is a good thing.
$C: Thanks Obama!

This opens the door to ISP to do what they always wanted - charge for levels of service. No protest is going to help.
$C: F
$C: For all of you in the comments saying that this is the end, we still have to wait for Congress's vote, and they're for Net Neutrality...

However, if it comes to the end of the internet (crossing my fingers, and spreading the word about contacting Congress as we speak)...

We need to let them know that the North remembers.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Stop saying the FCC repealed net neutrality.   The Republican Party repealed net neutrality. 
$C: I wish the FCC would just make sure true ISP competition could take place instead of regional monopolies then none of this would matter.
$C: What a laughing stock this country has become.
$C: What else can I do? I’ve called, sent letters, emailed, signed petitions, tried to inform my friends and family to do the same. What else?
$C: It is time to spam the hell out of all 435 House members and 50 Senate members!
$C: I hope history remembers Ajit Pai as one of the worst villains in American politics.
$C: We won't stop fighting. Obligatory fuck Pai
$C: Yeah this is definitely not making American great again. 
$C: "Land of the Free"
$C: I'm OK with whatever happens to him. Those in office should care what the public wants, one way or the other.
$C: We didn't do it Reddit
$C: I want this fucker jailed. I want him jailed for life for threatening our freedom. 
$C: Few years from now people will realize what we truly lost today . The impact of this will be enormous and I hope people remember the ones that were responsible for this . We officially became 3rd world in the age of information .
$C: If this doesn't wake you people up that the identity politics of the 21st century are complete lies to divide the people... What will?

It is so incredibly obvious a small group/s who has exponential power (wealth) accomplish (lobby) for anything they want. And usually that is moves that will gain them billions in ROI. 

Big business and greed is quite literally destroying the earth and humanity as we know it...

And all people talk about is skin color, age, sex, religion, political affiliations... Or some other ego identifier that clouds the mind of the low level consciousness.

"Huur duur trump. Huur duur republican huur duur taxes huur duurrr I can't see past this tiny blip in time I currently reside in. Hurr durr I am voting for the other guy next time..." Fools wake up. Please!!!!!!


$C: WHEN ARE WE PROTESTING!?!
$C: Net Neutrality, Let's keep it a reality!
$C: This can't not become a major legislative issue regardless of the actions of the puny FCC.  It doesn't matter how much money Verizon and Comcast pour through their lobbyists when we essentially tolerate their atrocious shitty mid-management between us and our real partners in life, amazon, google, and if youre cool enough, apple.  As soon as the major tech players get together to rethink our basic infrastructure, the sooner Comcast goes ala AOE and Yahoo.  
$C: So just waiting for the deep net to send the assassins now
$C: can someone make a tool that will crawl the internet for education content (wikipedia, youtube videos) and download it so people can view the content offline?
$C: Internet is about to be destroyed forever in US and this will have a ripple effect all across the world.
$C: Will somebody tell them to look at the people once a while ? God , this government is blind. Well anyways, we will still not back down. Keep fighting.
$C: Anyone knows what will happen to bitcoin? 
$C: this is precisely why we need tech like blockchain. 3 people made a decision for the entire country totally against the public’s will. unbelievable.
$C: So when do we riot?
$C: This is unfortunate, but I'm proud to know that we did indeed raise a great deal of awareness this time... This is not the end. 
$C: Good job Americans
$C: Wait are you saying me posting a picture of a politician with caption that he sold out my state didnt work? But it got 70k upvotes on redit!
$C: Can anyone tell me what will really happen next? Where does this go from here and how can it be over turned?
$C: > "Ajit Pai, the F.C.C. chairman, said the rollback of the net neutrality rules would eventually help consumers because broadband providers like AT&T and Comcast could offer people a wider variety of service options."

can someone explain to me what "Service options" we don't already have?
$C: Bay Area resident here! Just waiting now for Comcast to make some changes on my account so I can opt out and switch to Sonic (An ISP which supports NN).
$C: Five people is way too little a judgement board to decide over something thisculturally massive. I may not be American, but as my daily entertainment depends on american web users for about 75%, it worries me that a person who lies so blatantly and clearly has a more deluded view on reality than my psychotic  grandma when she's at her worst is allowed to make such an important decusion. F a sh*t pie man. Bloody moron.
$C: Fuck Republicans
$C: It's over until we vote out those that hold a corrupted seat as our representatives. We have to take away the power of the GOP if we want things to be for americans and not someone's wallet.
$C: This is downright unconstitutional at this point.
$C: Can someone help me understand why this is such a huge issue? I get that it gives ISPs the power to control our internet, but 2-3 years ago, before net neutrality, I don't seem to recall any issues I faced with the internet. And if it gives ISPs all the power, can't people just switch to an ISP that is more fair and unbiased? Seems like any ISP who is fair and unbiased would get all the business. Am I wrong for thinking this? 
$C: Legitimate question: How the hell can we get Shit Pie out of a leadership position in the FCC? Is there a way to vote him out?
$C: Why couldn't we have gone to the polls and had the people vote for Net Neutrality or not? Isn't that how democracy is supposed to work, esp with an issue like this which affects so many people.

IMO, the actual impact of repealing net neutrality is not as bad as the media and propaganda makes it out to be but i still prefer to have it in place. But what's most disturbing is how the vast majority of the country (including Trump supporters) wants net neutrality and yet it gets repealed. This is a very bad precident. 
$C: The Internet will not change over night. The companies are not stupid. The companies will inact slow and unnoticeable change. But be assured it will change for the worst.
$C: I just emailed my state's senators.  We're not going down PERIOD.  We're fighting this, for years if we have to, because this issue is too important to lose.  I can't imagine a future more dystopian than an internet that is not free and open, where a handful of ISPs have legal ability to censor and throttle competition.  If we don't stop this, we can kiss any hope of achieving or defending a functioning Democracy again goodbye.  So we're gonna fight, and even after today's loss and any loss hereafter, we will fight, we will be loud, and we will win back our fair internet.
$C: How will I stream rick n morty now 
$C: Raising a good question here. Isn't there some way under Article 2 of the Constitution we can impeach this ass? I mean, it's become blatantly clear that he is getting paid off and I am pretty sure that some of these payoffs are in violation of lobbying laws considering 83% wanted what he voted against
$C: You’re not being the voice for who voted you in Republicans... You’re just being asswipes with a position that’s slowly ticking away as you keep doing shit like this.
$C: Well.  Surfing the internet at work for news, etc is going to change. Maybe public libraries will become popular again.    This impacts online school work, businesses...  evolution went backwards today
$C: Texan here, long story short my rep told me to essentially go fuck myself. ‘‘Twas predictably frustrating.
$C: You will be done with the fight when your funding ends.
$C: We will never give up. Never.
$C: The US screwed...

Hell, Pai even got death threats against him!!
$C: How long until we can expect our service providers to start blocking and throttled our connections?
$C: I've been on twitter, instagram, etc and I am SO confused, somebody is saying and another is saying something different. So did they win to repeal net neutrality??? and doesn't it have to go through congress before it can be like completely set in stone?
$C: I really do hate to be that guy, but could someone explain net neutrality to me like I was 8?  And tell me how it will affect me?
$C: I cant believe the_donald right now. Every. Single. Issue. Wrong. Side.
$C: Good luck in the future to everyone in the United States. I sincerely hope it gets taken to court for all of your sakes.
$C: I'm so sick of seeing this smug douche's face... this shit feels hopeless
$C: Calling your Reps does not really make a difference FYI. Just harasses the staffers who hardly ever see the Member. 

Email is the way to go. Especially the general one. It goes directly into their database.
$C: "Predictably disappointing" is about the best way to put this. But the key word there is 'disappointing'. People are acting like the government just voted to allow nerve gas testing on Chicago or that this is the most impending crisis we've ever faced. Realistically, your internet experience is going to be somewhat degraded and they can nickel-and-dime you more. Have some perspective guys.

$C: The government's that be seem to be testing the waters to see what they can take away from us. I for one, will not stand for this. This is a clear violation of the very governing institutions that are meant to protect our public interests. Obviously, our protests are meaningless. The very democracy of this great nation is nothing but a sham. After this vote, my trust has been trampled on and so when I trample on you, don't let it come as a surprise. To hell with all of you.

EDIT: A word.
$C: I'm already paying too much a month for Internet. I can't afford crazy fucking packages or whatever else they're gonna put in place. Spectrum is for sure gonna fuck my wallet, no lube or protection. I hope nys puts measures in place to keep prices from going insane. If I'm understanding this right.
$C: Maybe stop giving the propagandists an open platform. I won't believe you care at all until t_d stops breaking all your rules with no repercussions. 
$C: I assume this is not a joke then. Well it is now,way to go America,lets go backwards while others go forward. This is sooo stupid its beyond comprehension.
$C: >organic takeovers

telling you'd have to specify that, spez...  implying that takeovers of the front page are not typically organic.
$C: Why all the angst? If they're right about this making the Internet better, we have time between now and 2020 to determine this. And if they're wrong, then Democrats have another issue. Speaking for myself, I have voted Republican since 1980, and if I feel like I am being screwed because of the FCC's overturning of Net Neutrality, I am willing to vote straight Democrat in 2020. Anyway, this isn't the end of the world and a lot can happen in two years.

Oh, and for what it's worth, I only have one Republican representative in Congress, Senator Marco Rubio and I wrote him about a month back expressing my displeasure with this. He, however, isn't up for reelection until 2022 so he probably doesn't care but anybody too lazy to write a letter deserves what the Republican-controlled House and Senate do about this (thus far, nothing).
$C: Probably a stupid question, but can minors call their representatives and participate in the fight? 
$C: so i have been following this movement and written to state reps. i use Comcast because my apartment offers no other choice for ISP's and they have been calling me to setup an appointment free of charge for a technician to come and examine "Service Issues" for my internet, i have not experienced any problems with my service recently sense they started calling a week ago so naturally i didn't set anything up. they called me last night and left the same message but included at the end that they "reserve the right to discontinue my service if i don't schedule an appointment". naturally i set up the appointment next time they called me because i need internet in my home. i couldn't help feel like this is some sort of ploy to install hardware that will ultimately lead to them putting fast and slow lanes into effect and that them discontinuing my service would be a response to me not complying to their soon to be established system. i will be watching closely on Monday when they visit (if they even visit knowing Comcast poor excuse for customer service) and making note of any new installations.
$C: Let's have a constitutional convention and mandate the impartial and uninhibited flow of information. 
$C: I'm waiting to see the notices ISPs will be sending business to join the fast lanes they promised not to make.
$C: So far I can still access Reddit, when do the additional fees start?
$C: "Looks like New York and Washington State have announced lawsuits against the FCC as a result of this. California Senator Scott Wiener says he will introduce a bill that'll require Net Neutrality in his state."

Can anyone fact check this? I saw it from a semi-reputable source but would like to know if it's actually true. 


$C: Thank you for this message. It gives me a thread of hope for the future. Keep up the fight everyone. 
$C: When does the fight for Reddit Neutrality begin?
$C: We need to march
$C: As a minor, what can I do to help stop the repeal of NN?
$C: I mostly find myself wondering how much money Pai has already been given and what other things he’s been promised. Future “jobs”, more money, power? There was nothing above board about this. 

$C: Merry fucking Christmas from Pai the anti-Santa.
$C: VOTE in any and all elections. Become informed!
$C: So now the FCC has reclassified Internet Service Providers into Internet Service Deciders.  And if you, as a customer, don't like their decision on which sites to throttle or which Apps to block, you are supposed to go to a different ISD.  My problem is that  I have very few choices for ISD. 
$C: Honestly, I cannot think of anybody who benefits from the repeal of Net Neutrality except for millionaires. Today was just an indication that the government doesn't care about its ordinary constituents; they are just there to appease the rich. 
$C: This administration sure has done some very unpopular shit for being so Populist. 
$C: The amount of backlash about to come is going to be amazing.
$C: As usual, fuck American Conservatives. They're just the worst people on Earth, and they won't stop until they've shit in everyone's backyard.
$C: if you don't vote, or you do vote for any GOP Representative, don't be surprised when they ignore what the public actually wants in favor of corporate interests.

PS: be smart enough to ignore slogans such as, "drain the swamp" and watch what they do.


$C: Lmao, you pissed off so many T_D type people. Controversial is fucking hilarious! Like seriously, how can someone be so full of them self that they think this is a good thing. It’s like they don’t even actually understand what net neutrality is. 
$C: Ajitator Pai has thrown the first stone
$C: I always try not to use bad words. But this time, seriously, FUCK YOU A SHIT PIE. 
$C: FUCK AJIT PAI AND HIS UGLY FACE
$C: Again, the best way to contact Representatives is via email. It automatically gets sorted in a database that tallies numbers up. Don't call Reps if you don't live in their district. Calling over and over is just harassing staffers who probably even agree with you. 
$C: u/tippr 10 usd

Thanks for sharing! This needs to be discussed and all of the implications need to be seriously considered.
$C: Damn this is so disturbing!! I really hope this will be turned around

$C: i think we all saw this coming, The Rich people want more money.
$C: Ajit Pai is a beast
$C: How much do you think an upvote should cost? 
$C: Have we considered crying about it? We can also try to scare and shame people that disagree with us by playing a thinly veiled racism card!
$C: You guys already throttle subreddits that have the wrong political views, so nobody cares about your hypocritical opinions.
$C: Does this mean people will start buying magazines and physical music albums again?
$C: So whens the protests start?
$C: Finally there'll be less americans in the internet
$C: Absolutely deplorable.  We need everything that we can muster to fix this dumpster fire that is the FCC as it fails, blatantly, at the one and only thing that they exist for: protecting the consumer.
$C: Ajit Pai is pronounced "A Shit Pie"
$C: I hope congress fights this shit. At least there's a better chance to protect NN then there is for Republicans to take out Obama Care.
$C: So does anyone think it's weird that the Disney deal was announced today? Or am I being a conspiracy nut?
$C: Now we vote out any Congress members that took a dollar from the ISP companies. This whole mess started because Verizon created Ajit Pai so they need to know how we feel about them.
$C: yeas
$C: USA, the country that screws the rest of the world and itself day by day. 
$C: I’ll just leave these here...

$C: Sorrow isn’t something one considers when balancing the internet 

But this....

This does put a frown on my face...
$C: I am from Europe, and I surely will go out to protest this act of terrorism. It is unacceptable that human beings on the other side of this ocean are losing their human rights! I will surely be tomorrow out there trying to voice my concerns!
$C: Is it okay to use violence? Since democracy apparently isn't working. 
$C: The 2018 and 2020 elections are ever more important.
$C: What can I do as an individual to help?
$C: The over-parasites continue their quest to destroy the future of the psychotic human ape.
$C: Organic takeovers my ass. You're so full of shit /u/spez. 
$C: Lol
$C: I can't read any of this. Send help.
$C: Fucking scumbag politicians dont represent anybody  in this country unless they give them money
$C: Its sad how the people voting over this issue probably do not use the internet nearly as much as all those who were pro net neutrality. In Canada, we have it still in place, but some old 70 year old bloke is trying to get rid of it. Newsflash, this is a problem for those 10-40 years old, who frequently rely on the internet, not 70 year old government officials trying to promote businesses. This is sad, if the people had a vote America would still have Net Neutrality.
Fuck Ajit Pai
$C: Why won't people go out on the streets and protest? Online protests can be said to be faked and exaggerated, and are easily countered. Hundreds of thousands of people on the streets can't.
$C: I knew free porn was too good to be true. Well it was fun while it lasted . 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Keep fighting, the net must be neutral 
$C: 'Organic takeovers' Fucking lol.


Yes, let's believe the guy who changes users posts has anything relevant to say.
$C: Could start with some transparency and fair play here on your own site.
$C: The vote [was 3-2 *for* net neutrality in 2015](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-releases-open-internet-order), too, but the two dissenters were Republicans, so Reddit's admins didn't feel the need to emphasize that ("Please note the FCC is not united in this decision and find the dissenting statements from commissioners [Pai](https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-15-24A5.pdf) and [O'Reilly](https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-15-71A6.pdf).")

It wasn't united then, either, but *muh government can do no wrong*.
$C: Since you're so adamant about wanting a free and open Internet, why do you treat subreddits different depending on if you agree with their political agenda or not?
$C: https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/net-neutrality-repeal-case-for-public-broadband

More people are getting on this train. Nationalize the Net. Net Neutrality is a half-measure sham and democrat transfer of power from evil ISPs to equally vile silicon valley
$C: As a citizen of the US this is disgraceful. Give our internet rights back. Net neutrality must be returned for our freedom.
$C: And so starts authoritarianism in America
$C: Thanks for fighting for Net Neutrality, Reddit; hopefully we keep the fire lit under Congress's feet and/or see the FCC in court.  Disgusting how Pai just ignored the millions of citizens, companies, and the **creators of the Internet themselves** who came out against this...
$C: I can't imagine it getting past the supreme court, it's unconstitutional
$C: *I am done.* Who cares?
$C: Please keep in mind - censoring, blocking, or throttling a website for any anti-competitive reason is still illegal under title I without Net Neutrality.
$C: Today evil won.
$C: Phones are busy everywhere I call. Keep it up. Don't stop after today people.
$C: This comment will likely be buried, but [this article](https://www.alternet.org/story/151850/8_reasons_young_americans_don%27t_fight_back%3A_how_the_us_crushed_youth_resistance) is something everyone should read. Unfortunately, I have given up on the hope of any radical change in America, since we the young people are too neutered to fight back.
$C: It is truly frightening to see how many people trust The State to look after any interests but those of The State.
$C: Holy shit at The Donald they're celebrating.
$C: This post is so hopeful, but I’m genuinely afraid for the future. Not just here, but in all aspects of government and the US as a whole. 

It feels like corruption and constant selfishness always win the day. I hate that we rely on companies to have any say, when in reality it’s the people’s voice that’s supposed to matter. What happens when these companies’ interests don’t align with the people? What then? Why aren’t our voices enough? People have poured a tremendous amount of energy into so many important causes, with seemingly no results except for all of us feeling a little better.

I know this isn’t the place for this kind of talk; honestly I’m just pouring my feelings into the world. But fuck, man. This sucks. It’s scary and it sucks.
$C: Honest question: how can the people do something about this? Clearly, this is not in the best interest of the citizens, but in that of the corporations lining the politicians’ pockets. I know that we can call our congressmen, but I don’t know how effective that really is. Why is this a thing? If this bill passes, what can US citizens actually do to make their voices heard? The government is supposed to work for the people and it’s becoming clearer and clearer that that is no longer the case. 
$C: This wasn't democratic at all. Is this the end to democracy? Wtf is going on? How can we fight if they don't care and hold all the power?
$C: Yeah, "organic" takeovers.
$C: Today's vote solidifies corp control over our government.  We've always known this, but this time they threw it in our face.  Treated us as if we are irrelevant. 
$C: With the repeal of #NetNeutrality ISPs will have legal authority to block anything they want. If you thought #FakeNews was a problem, just wait until there's #NoNews.
$C: Idk why anyone thinks the average opinion matters. Money=getting to have an opinion. Time and time again the American government proves the average person has no say in the matter and they prove they aren't looking out for our best interest, just their pockets. Why does anyone think that is going to change now?

I'm so done trying to care about any of this. Based on the upcoming state of the government anything republicans want to pass will get passed. I bet Ajit Pai is laughing his ass off at the thought of "reddit activism" actually doing anything...  
$C: Reddit doesn't want to have to pay the ISP's to carry their heavy advertisments to your house.  They are using you all like pawns to do their bidding for them.

The reduction in government regulations will likely have no effect on your life.  And if the dystopian future the fear mongerers have all led you to worry about takes place, then it won't be difficult to reinstate regulations.
$C: Will it matter? Because these rules didn't exist until 2015 and the internet was ok then.
$C: My youtube, google, and vudu accounts have been blocked, my ISP doubled my charges for facebook, and no word on my instagram account, but I will check it for content-based censorship a little later today....  Oh wait... 
$C: BUT HER EMAILS
$C: Typical republican bullshit. “We are all for the people, we love the people. Let’s pass bills and laws that benefit the people!”
*proceeds to screw over the ‘people’ in favor of companies*
$C: Can't we just hire some deep web assasins to scare his ass lol
$C: Welcome to the United Corporations of Greed. RIP the United States of America.
$C: People think the fight is over they got a big surprise comin 
Call your government officials and elected officials, it's not over yet!!!
$C: /u/spez leading the fight! 
$C: Time to call up the militia 
$C: Let me know what I can do rn👍🏻
$C: so when were you planning to start fighting for it exactly
$C: daafsdafa
$C: Fuck you spez, you say all this but add in targeted advertising on the down low.
$C: Of course he pushed for a repeal. He's doing the bidding of his highest donors
$C: /u/spez, are you being paid by the US government to keep up r/t_d and obvious paid poster subreddits such as https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNetNeutrality/?
$C: How can you be for net neutrality when you're not for front page neutrality?
$C: The internet is back to pre-2015 chaos. Oh, the humanity.
$C: So are you going to use this to distract from the fact that you defaulted everybody's Reddit settings to Reddit collecting their history and selling it to advertisers?
$C: Isn’t it ironic that spez is against the censorship of the internet yet he perpetrated acts of censorship himself
$C: http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/12/04/trumps-fcc-chair-shuts-down-celebrities-pushing-net-neutrality-conspiracy-theory 
Please read this article!!!!! 
$C: What a fucking circle jerk this site is.
$C: Fuck you, Spez. You’re garbage.
$C: Thank God it passed 
$C: /u/spez why don't you just edit Net Neutrality into existence like you edit people's comments?
$C: To be fair. Reddit isn't really neutral either, with all it's political bias, all the bans, and the astroturfing, and //u/spaz getting caught editing other people's post. 
$C: /u/spez if your for net neutrality why do you heavily censor Reddit? 


$C: Here's me thinking that checks and balances still exists. Fuck the FCC fuck Ajit Shitface and fuck Trump. We're driving into territory we've never been in before... and oh is it dangerous. Clearly these people don't understand what we're capable of as actions of retaliation.
$C: will call my representative and tell him I am 100% for the repeal.

keep government out of the private sector.. no more regulations

$C: Dear /u/Spez,

You are a retard
$C: Dear /u/Spez,

You are a retard
$C: The removal of net neutrality signals the end of one form of American freedom. A freedom which was forged by blood, and sweat. A fight which has been fought since the birth of the nation. The freedom of speech. By adding prices onto certain apps which we used for speech for example, Snapchat. This restrict the ability of some to be able to speak(due to economic differences of being unable to afford it) thus a clear violation of the first amendment "abridging the freedom of speech". While the federal communications commission is not the congress, it still falls congress to maintain such rights are not violated.  If we continue go down this path more and more right will be bought away soon we may has well follow china's atrocious internet path or worse. 
$C: My question is how did the internet survive prior to 2015?  I mean from its inception until 2015 it worked very well. Why does it now need government regulation?  Do you really trust the government to run net neutrality?  “Net Neutrality “ is but two years old; the internet was great before it and it will continue to be great after these ridiculous regulations are relegated to the “dustbin of history”.  Everyone have a beer or a smoke and calm down. 
$C: so will reddit pick up the slack and make sure they treat there users neutrally?
$C: You can't fight because the Republicans don't care about you or what you sign? The Repubs are the enemy. Not friends. They don't give a care. The only way to fight is to stop voting for Republicans.
$C: The majority was ignored completely and there will be no consequence. Fear needs to be struck into these people. They need to think "I did the wrong thing and mis-represent these people, I and I may be killed for it." They are actively taking freedoms away from people and setting a precedent that it is ok to do so. That is evil and must be rooted out in the only way evil can be, violence.
  
$C: What about porn?
$C: Whatever spez is for we should all be against  #resist 
$C: Net Neutrality has been overturned and reddit is practically unusable tonight. But it has nothing to do with Net Neutrality.

Perhaps consider [fixing your site](https://i.imgur.com/ttB4Ew5.png) before rallying up slacktivism to fight for your business' interests. I don't know how it is acceptable for a top 10 _globally_ ranked site to be brought to its knees as often as reddit.
$C: Reddit bans any sub that triggers them and then goes on to complain about how censorship MIGHT happen from your ISP. Fuck off. You are the monopoly censoring people. 
$C: Check out Substratum project. It can solve this issue.
$C: Hey Reddit, maybe get off your ass and actually DO SOMETHING. Nobody gives a shit about what happens on this website. All these thousands of posts and upvotes but I don't see a single actual in person protest happening anywhere. 
$C: Agreed, The Government Always makes things BETTER. Let Them Control our Internet. (sigh)
$C: I think it is awesome how hundreds of thousands of American Redditors come together to fight one common cause from the depths of reddit to the surface. The battle for the net is going to be long, but we have hope, groups all across America are coming together to file lawsuits against the FCC. Stay strong America.
$C: how am i supposed to do my homework now
$C: Let's start a change.org petition asking for the resignation of Ajit Pai, chair of the FCC. ✊
$C: Shit! No wonder my internet speed was only 1MBPS this morning and I got a phone call from Comcast with a recording saying "I see your Internet seems a bit slow today. If you want faster internet you can upgrade right now for only 99.99 per month!"

Oh wait, nothing happened and nothing will happen. Yet all of the fear mongers will continue on as if something did happen. Strange how that works.
$C: Remember those women who protested peacefully for the right to vote called the 'suffragists'. They keep on protesting but still the goverment took no notice of it. Now, how about the 'suffragettes', they were militant and the goverment took notice of it and some years later they got the vote. The point is that we need to do something different so that FCC will notice how bad it it.
$C: From my European point of view what worries me most is this atack on the net neutrality extending outside the USA, I really hope this nonsense will stop
$C: Everyone keeps saying there's nothing I can do as a Canadian to help, but I want to make an impact. Any advice?
$C: Lol reddit used to be better before 2015 anyways. Hopefully repealing net neutrality will bring this site back to its glory days. Right now this website is like one big advertisement 
$C: I'm sick of living in this world, genuinely. I used to have so many plans, things I wanted to achieve, and every day it feels like this administration is taking another stair off the ladder that would have let me get there. I lost my health care after Trump took office, our taxes are going to go up when we could already barely afford them, and now the internet is going to get a corporate chokehold and my business runs on the internet, so now I don't even know if I'll be able to get my customers to visit my shop without paying extra for the privilege. So I just want to say, Thank you Grandpa Jim for voting to ruin my and all of your other grandchildren's lives, we'll never forget or forgive.
$C: Thank you all. 
$C: You're done, u/Spez.

Thanks for showing us your current bot and spam game tho.

I understand you gotta show Soros and the ShareBlue team progress after you lost control of this site in the '16 race.

Keep the shilling up!
$C: Internet providers who throttle customers internet connection will see their finances drop as customers leave them. Its bad business practice as eve sudden link found out when they tried something similar with their data allowance plan. Nobody who left sudden link went back after they rolled back their attempts on data allowance b.s. 

If they think newer generations are stupid they're dead wrong. Blame will not be on internet traffic sites it will be on the providers. Those who are net savvy will make them pay by taking their business elsewhere.
$C: Lol, salty tears. 
$C: Please forgive. I don’t know much about net neutrality. But net neutrality has only been in effect for 2 years. Was it a crisis before we had it? I don’t think it was. All I’m saying is, this has not effected me before, I don’t think it will effect me now.
$C: Since I'm not a US citizen I'll cheer from the side lines and just help make an uproar on the interwebz. Who knows, could be my country that trys to pull this shit next.
$C: Lol these admins. Run a company that routinely picks favorites and removes things they don't agree with. Get pissed because Comcast will be allowed to do the same 🤣
$C: Guys, think real for a second. How realistic is it that your ISP is /actually/ going to implement a "Super Mega Holy Shit" package that denies you access to Reddit or YouTube or Netflix, etc. unless you pay extra. If anything at all, we'd be paying slightly more per month in general, for the same unrestricted access we've enjoyed since the internet came around. NN didn't really do anything, except state what was already happening. Also, the main thing people like to ignore: this isn't just a repeal. The big bad FCC isn't trying to fuck over consumers, they're replacing the title II regulation with a title I.
$C: I'm done fighting for net neutrality. I never even fought for it in the first place. Glad it got repealed. 
$C: The hypocrite speaks.
$C: I wrote to Rep. John Moolenaar (MI) and got the standard Republican response saying he understands my concerns blah blah blah, but he will do what he wants (basically). I pleaded that most of his constituents live in rural areas without access to affordable quality internet. Many of us have to pay out the rear for satellite internet and those plans don't come with "unlimited" access. He is all for the farmers, but this time he gives zero shits.
$C: While the Ajit hate is justifiable, Trump isn't catching enough shit for this. He's a corporate whore, worse than Clinton (hell, even she is pro-neutrality). A proper free market with proper competition is a great thing, but many of these providers are running a monopoly across large parts of the US.

Even the hardcore at the_donald can't universally think this is a good thing. I get that the establishment and mainstream media is alienating, you don't feel enfranchised and that your voice is getting quieter. But this is huge, and is all the evidence needed that Trump's administration is more of the same, maybe worse. 

This is a blatant grab, please consider not voting for his ilk until the Republicans sort themselves out and become a respectable conservative party, following a mandate for the best interests of the people again. 
$C: This doesn’t apply to 🇨🇦 correct? 
$C: So the first person to release a convenient app for windows, android and apple variations to easily browse and connect to a list of mesh networks are going to be unlimited money-aires?
$C: I'm not paying for Twitter, YouTube or Reddit. I think I'll get back to my life instead 
Edit: And never Facebook. Ditch it years ago and have never once regretted that Time parasite 
$C: I'm not American so what I want to know is, what the heck is Trump doing about this?
$C: So maybe I could get some help here. At about 5pm today I got an auto reply from each of my representatives in DC thanking me for contacting them about something and that they would respond to me shortly. Due to the timing I can't help but think it's probably NN related but the problem is that I haven't sent any of my representatives anything in a few weeks now. These replies we're all addressed to my by name at my primary email account. I'm all for supporting NN but if someone is speaking for me without my express permission at the time they are doing so then I am 100% not ok with that. Additionally I have no idea what was said on my behalf, for all I know it could have been supporting the FCC's actions. 

So basically how can I go about finding out who is contacting my representatives in my name and what they told them on my behalf so that I can put an end to it (wether I agree with what they are saying or not).

*Edit: checked the emails again and they only have my email, didn't mention me by name as I initially thought.  But this is my personal email that I only use for important stuff and with people I trust, not given to businesses or organizations ever.  Not to say though that my name for sure wasn't used because these are just cookie cutter auto replies so far so aren't customized at all. 
$C: Karmas a bitch Pai. 
$C: I did what I cld by petitioning & sharing the link to the FCC comment site w/ anyone I know, but maybe it was just a matter of these greedy bastards simply waiting for the vote as a final hurdle. I’ve watched as many big cable co.’s have dug up the same earth, laying underground cable, no less than 10x around my neighborhood in the last year ... even though there’s NO new development in this area. Maybe they’ve known all along and have been implementing the cable networks all year in prep for whatever crap is to come? anyone else seen the same over the last yr? 
$C: How can those living in the UK help?
$C: Shut up u/spez, you cuck
$C: You're doing it all wrong.  You need to REBRAND this whole thing.  The average person is not going to understand what "net neutrality" means.  It doesn't sound threatening.  It sounds peaceful and harmless.  You need to rebrand this whole thing or you're never going to get anywhere.  Names like Black Widow Spider, toxic... virus... etc.
$C: Go fuck yourself reddit.
$C: I'm vary interested I'm seeing how companies, who support net neutrality, is going to handle this. I imagine that providers such as Google, Facebook, etc can get some knowledge of which "Lane" the user is on. Why don't they do the opposite, and provide content for fast lanes as slowly as possible?

Ah, I know I'm killing the neutrality myself, but this is to go against the companies who want to offer paid prioritisation (read: you are slower if you don't pay) to say that "If you try to use our service to get people to pay more money for what they already had, then you have to answer to us".

If Google was able to force people into the slower plans, then ISPs would have no incentive to creating fast lanes, and a net neutral ISP would be able to offer a service that most Americans want - even if the FCC chairman does not. 
$C: Surely, as a service provider, YouTube, Netflix, Reddit, Facebook, Hulu and other providers could simply throttle the three people who didn't vote "NO" and see how they enjoy the lack of access to anything useful. Could even extend it to family members and friends. See how they carry that pressure. 
$C: Did any of you guys actually use the internet pre-2015?  This isn’t an issue.  This isn’t the end of the world.  
$C: Time for Substratum to step up a level and start delivering the solution.
$C: It actually makes me sick that this mother fucker just cares about money. His face is just smiling at us, he couldn't care less. 
$C: You know, when I first heard of net neutrality a few years back, it made sense. It was perfect. IT WORKED. It kept companies from crushing the consumers with charges, and transactions, etc. This vote, this idea, disgusts me. To think that our government is basically covering it's ears and screaming "LALALALA!" is terrible.

Side note: If this happens in America, who knows where else this could set precedent? On the internet, we are not seperate, we are one. This affects everyone. Don't say "It's in America", because it is on our one net. The INTERnet.
$C: Having watched the meeting I was truly disgusted at how they all laughed at Commissioner Mignon Clyburn at the end of her dignified speech - it showed a massive lack of respect, not just for her, but for the the people, and their principles, that she was representing. " I'll take that as a no" Pai laughed - followed by huge laughter including someone imitating a hyena and definitely gaining financially from this - Time to clean your house, USA - your whole country has been taken over by a deeply unpleasant mafia cartel ....
$C: u/Manzalawy8

$C: SPEZ IS A CUCK
$C: Circumcise him with a thousand degree knife
$C: Your resistance is futile.
$C: You fell victim to one of the most classic blunders! The most famous of which is "Never enter a room alone with Harvey Weinstein." But only slightly less famous "Never trust a politician to do the right thing when donations are on the line."
HAHAHA hahaha
-this page has failed to load would you like to purchase access to this content-
$C: So AT&T Comcast and Verizon have already extorted the government now they get to extort everyone else. Some retard in the FCC allowed this. So that would make him an accomplice to extortion correct?
$C: Dear /u/spez:

How can you claim to be for an "open internet" when you sell /r/politics to ShareBlue and censor the Judicial Watch AMA?

On an unrelated note:  Merry Christmas, and give my best to the missus and her boyfriends's kids.
$C: Yes keep on fighting guys!
$C: god DAMNIT AJIT
$C: Can somebody explain to me why exactly it is so difficult to just make a law to make it illegal to throttle or control the internet in any way? Wouldn't it literally be as simple as passing any other law? It's just in this case the people responsible for making the law have been paid off?
$C: I thought Trump's tax cuts killed me, but then I remembered the FCC already did that.

True story
$C: So you’re pro- net neutrality but ban r/gundeals because, I don’t know,  because “you can”? Talking about double standards. 
$C: It has been nearly 4 months. Literally nothing has changed at all. Good job literally everyone on Reddit, just as I predicted you guys made yourselves look like idiots.
$C: The greatest pleasure in life is doing what other people say you cannot do.  If you have no critics you’ll likely have no success. The best way to predict your future is to create it. 
$C: Can I get some karma so I can post 
$C: The fcc wont let me be so let me be me and ill let you see
$C: Wow what a shocker, clicking the upvote button on Reddit doesn't actually do anything.  

Maybe you dipshits will actually go fucking vote in 2018. 
$C: # WE DIDN'T DO IT REDDIT!
$C: Frustrating is that Reddit still haven't banned r/t_d despite them breaking the rules and promoting brigading *again*.
$C: ???

They didn't vote yet. O'Rielly is still talking.
$C: You’re a hypocrite, Spez.
$C: In a small way I take pleasure in the fact that people like my redneck piece of shit brother who can't hold a job because of his own shortcomings who blames immigrants won't be able to afford doing what he does now on the internet, this time next year. He can barely afford the cheapest service plan available, currently, and struggles to pay his monthly bill. I know it will hurt me too but I can't wait for the day I get to rub this, and other policies Trump is destroying, in his face.
$C: Security has asked everyone to clear the room while Chairman Pai was speaking.
Wow, people can be idiots.
$C: Hope all the Gamergate dolts on this site who spread Clinton conspiracy theories while raging about how important Net Neutrality is are happy.
$C: We may have lost the battle, but we will not lose this war. 
$C: Ok -rubs hands together- Where can I get on the lawsuit bandwagon?
$C: very sad day for the internet. 
$C: Hillary Rodham Clinton was the only thing in November standing in the way of a Republican FCC but you fuckers wrote in Bernie, voted Stein, or straight up didn't bother to get to the fucking voting booth, even though a lot of you live in a swing state.
$C: >  It was inspiring to witness organic takeovers of the front page   

Perhaps you'll remember that the next time you ban someone and call them a spammer for using Reddit to promote their own project they've been working on for years.   

You constantly sound the alarm about an Internet built around favoritism and greed, yet one need look no further than Reddit's own policies to see it's already here.   Google, Facebook, Netflix, Reddit, Amazon and YouTube own the Internet like a pimp owns pussy.  

And you make #(%*&@#%(* sure we never forget it.  

Perhaps during the next home page "takeover" we can discuss the concept of hypocrisy.   

$C: [deleted]
$C: u/spez your interview on CNBC was incredibly cringeworthy.  The one host, Jon Fortt,  felt Reddit was whipped into a hysteria and completely blew off what you were saying.  
Here's most of the interview: https://streamable.com/uhdjx
$C: > Organic takeover 

Ahahahahahahahahahahahaha.

Inhales.

AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
$C: BUT HER E-MAILS!
$C: whoever bomb threated the FCC, you just killed any chance of the people wanting the law to stay in place being seen in a good light
$C: 1. The FCC isn't repealing the ideas behind Net Neutrality.  The ideas of a Free and Open Internet have long been enshrined by the FCC and the Market.  ISPs have been committed to various forms of Net Neutrality since 1990s and there have only been 4 examples in history in which ISPs employed non-neutral policies.  In which all 4 examples have been handled without the current Net Neutrality regulations.
https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/12/ftc-fcc-outline-agreement-coordinate-online-consumer-protection

2.  Arguments for Net Neutrality "Title 2" have little to no facts backing up their assumptions and accusations and rely entirely on fear mongering. 

3.  What I think most people that really want, but don't know how to say:  Last Mile Open Access Network.  Or Local-loop Unbundling.  Something that the FCC stated it would not enforce under the current "Title 2" regulations.

>Wheeler rejected that type of heavy-handed utility regulation, instead announcing that there would be "no rate regulation, no filing of tariffs, and no network unbundling." By promising only "light-touch" common carrier rules. 
https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/why-tom-wheeler-rejected-broadband-price-caps-and-last-mile-unbundling/

4.  What everyone should work towards is getting Congress to update the Communications Act of 1934 to be updated for a new type of Utility - the Internet Service Provider. You can't ask the FCC to enforce something in which there are no updated laws on the books for.  The current Net Neutrality regulations loop-holes are so wide that they are unenforceable and relies only good-faith.

$C: can we shitpost this in 6 months when the internet still works?
$C: Fuck Ajit Pai with a rusty saw.
$C: I honestly saw this coming. 

No matter how many calls or emails we sent, 100 of our voices are only worth one congress voice. 

We were fucked from the beginning.

Good night, and good fucking luck.
$C: I'm Republican, but Net Neutrality NEEDS to stay. This is America, this is our freedom.
$C: In the middle of Ajit Pai's spiel, a woman came up and informed him that they needed to take a break on the advice of security. I think something might be going on outside of their building...
$C: We need to start an uprising or something this is fucking ridiculous.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I kinda wish the dark ages mentality was still enforced to some degree in situations like this. Where if a higher power was being really shitty, all of us citizens could rise up and murder him and then everyone just gets on their lives.
$C: It's over guys.
$C: Ajit Pai is perhaps the least charismatic person on the face of the Earth. I don't understand why this vote is going through; it's so clear that it only benefits those who will do wrong with it. Hopefully this is going to shut down. Soon.
$C: Get all these foxes out of the hen house! Start by voting every single Republicans out of their office 
$C: I am Spanish, but I still care for my USA pals.
For me, the most frustrating thing is this video that Ajit Pai just posted: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFhT6H6pRWg
$C: I feel far from good
$C: I am sorry for your loss American friends. Hope you guys still get to reddit.
$C: Im so lost, did they repeal it?
$C: So, again... **why** do you allow a subreddit for the dense motherfuckers that got the President elected who appointed the asshole who did this?
$C: Hard to believe they’re almost getting away with this. 
$C: This was bought and paid for. There was no doubt about this outcome.

Unfortunately most congressmen and congresswomen could care less about what their constituents want or need. All that matters is that the corporate donations keep pouring in.
$C: Anybody with a face that punchable has to be a douche bag.  Ted Cruz.  Martin Shkreli.  Ajit Pai.
$C: Is it possible to bring a class action lawsuit against one of the ISPs if they try any funny business? Like arguing on first amendment or equal protection grounds that that shit is unconstitutional? Any legal experts willing to weigh in?
$C: Question: why are we mad at Spez?
$C: Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with Republicans? Why are they always focusing on the wrong fucking issues?

It just seems like everything they've done since Trump won is fuck the country upside down and do every single thing in their power to erase Obama's legacy.
$C: I will never understand why the future of information access in the United States was left up to 5 individuals that are not even elected officials. That is how you know we are living in a broken system. 
$C: Spez,

On one hand, you write these updates and claim to stand behind NN, and yet on the other, you give a huge amount of support to the most ardent anti-NN crusaders on the internet: The_Donald.  Here's their thread for today's "victory": https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7jtesf/the_battle_for_net_neutrality_is_over_the/

You claim to stand behind the concept of free speech, but behind your back you are letting it be destroyed perniciously and without much notice.

You should not be the CEO of Reddit.
$C: Man, fuck this shit country. I'm so fucking sick of it. My biggest regret in life is serving in the military. I'm fucking done, time to start applying for citizenship and take my degree elsewhere.
$C: shouldn't of voted for trump, spez

shouldnt of kept t_d around, spez

shouldev banned more nazis and not let them use your website to spread hate and misinformation, spez

you fucking dingus
$C: Americans getting what they deserve; just like in the Presidential election.
$C: Hey U/spez, why pretend to care about a free and open internet while allowing massive Astroturfing campaigns to take place on your site? 
$C: I hope Ajit Pai gets cancer-AIDS
$C: Tick Tock Republicans, you’re time is almost up...
$C: Fuck Ajit Pai
$C: People crying about this literally have no clue what it means. All it means is that the FTC will regulate the internet instead of the FCC. Nothing will change on the users end. It's all one big misunderstanding or outright lying by people. 

>the internet can throttle what sites you can visit and block you from visiting certain sites

They violate three FTC laws by doing so. It's illegal to do that. So the entire internet is getting their panties in a bunch based on lies or retards not understanding what this shift means. The internet will go back to exactly how it was pre-2015. Did you notice any change when it happened? No? Stop panicking. Fucking pussies.
$C: >*organic* takeovers of the front page

Still not convinced this was the case.


$C: [ Removed by reddit on account of violating the [content policy](/help/contentpolicy). ]
$C: OMG..... This is fascism!!!! The government NOT taking control of the Internet is exactly something Hitler would do!!!


$C: u/spez gets caught suppressing free speech and now vows to continue the fight for a free and open internet.

This is why I’m against Net Neutrality.

Social media outlets actively suppress free speech, but joined the fight for Net Neutrality.

This is why I’m against Net Neutrality.

Keyboard warriors all over the internet lecture me about how the Government is in the pockets of lobbyists paid for by big corporations, but then want the Government to control the internet.

This is why I’m against Net Neutrality.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Fuck the FCC. Fuck Ajit Pai. This is a betrayal of the American people and the interest of everyone. This is not a republican vs democrat issue, it's a greedy scum sucking pigs vs the American people issue. How is this not a direction violation of the freedom of speech?!
$C: Elections have consequences.  Clinton may not have been perfect, but if more people sucked it up and voted for her anyways, we wouldn't be in this position today. 
$C: Why has no one murdered those responsible for this yet?
$C: The day the internet...died,
So
Bye bye Mr Ajit Pai, 
Drove my modem to edge of the cable, but the cable was dry,
Them good ole boys were drinking bandwidth and rye.  
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This will be the day that internet dies...

What I got so far..
$C: Ban T_D already. The alt-right helped bring us to this point.
$C: >The FCC’s vote was predictably frustrating

I thought they haven't voted yet
$C: Bahahahahaha "organic"
$C: You know you could always cheer us up by finally growing a spine and banning the_donald already
$C: > It was inspiring to witness organic takeovers

Yea I don't think it was really that organic, and to me at least, was pretty dumb and kind irked me. My state sub, which is VERY inactive, relieving on average one post a day, average of 15 comments, and on a high day received 70 up votes,  got these posts calling out senators and representatives. In the time they were up they overtook our top posts of all time by 4 times last I checked. Now one could say " People just care about this so much it brought all the lurkers out!" But from the people who commented, they were not lurkers, they were people with an agenda who came looking specifically for these posts. 
$C: We just lost....
$C: > organic takeovers

😂
$C: One thing I’d like to see is an informative non-biased breakdown of what exactly NN laws cover, how the internet operated before/after NN laws, difference between before NN laws and post NN repeal, existing measures that will prevent concerns from pro NN people from happening, underlying issues that NN is designed to address and a breakdown in why they are issues, are there other smaller things the FCC can do that they aren’t currently to prevent issues raised by pro NN people?  
Basically just a fair breakdown of the situation. All I see on reddit is “OMG, repealing NN is going to be the end of the Internet as we know it!!”, but I’m not seeing any actual reason for it that seems legitimate or that can’t be addressed in a different way
$C: It’s sad to think that we have lived in the golden age already. 
$C: I'm not american but this will fuck up everyone besides the europeans perhaps. This Ajit fuckface is now not only an american traitor, but a whole humanity enemy.
$C: > It was inspiring to witness organic takeovers of the front page (twice), 

Riiiiight.  “Organic”. 

Nothing like little unknown subs with a small subscriber count suddenly being thrust onto the front page of /r/all with tens of thousands of upvotes. 
$C: We lost the battle, but not the war. 
$C: This is what you all get for being ignorant during last year's election. 

This is too funny. Dont take the anger on the GOP they are there because you wanted them to be 
$C: Don't like this? Quit voting Republican. It's truly that simple.
$C: BU BU BU BUT her emails!

Sorry, I hate to be that guy, but this shit, along with EVERY OTHER BAD THING the Trump administration has done needs to be a fucking wake up call to people who waffled when it came to voting in this election, or who did protest votes. Just like Obama said, don't boo, vote. Elections have consequences and younger people especially are letting their future be eaten away by old ass white people who reliably come out each and every time to vote for shit that effects everybody else. 

Even if you didn't like Hilary, she was better than Trump. Fuck, Trump can't even complete a sentence. He's barely literate, but somehow he was better than the alternative? The perfect candidate doesn't exist, but we would have been so much better off with anyone but Trump. Now America is paying the consequences. Trump is installing people to every agency in government that is the antithesis of what those agencies stand for. We could have stopped this but people were too apathetic and acted like the stakes weren't that high. Thanks, fence sitters! 
$C: Throttle conservative subreddits.   That'll get the message across.
$C: Odd how spez claims to care about neutrality. Does that neutrality also include editing others inputs when they are at odds with his own? 
$C: "We will keep on fighting here on Reddit....."

Oh good...... I would miss the constant propaganda being shoved down my throat every day on the front page.
$C: Write to my representatives?  Why?  I live in Ultra-liberal New York state.  You know how much Net Neutrality I heard from the likes of Chuck Schumer or Louise Slaughter?  

NOT.  A.  GOD.  DAMN.  WORD.

They ARE the elite.  This was an issue that would affect only the little people... and as much as Democrats try to label themselves as "for the people", here's a prime example of them staying completely silent as quality of life gets better for them but potentially worse for us.

Face it, folks.  This issue is dead... because it was never an issue in American politics to begin with.
$C: Nice crocodile tears, u/spez. If only you could have done something about the subreddit that repeatedly broke the site rules, instead of modifying how the site itself works due to their manipulative presence. You reap what you sow.
$C: Vote democrat people. Thia is what happens whenyou let the south in the whitehouse
$C: If you listen closely you can almost hear the collective grunts of anger from the hundreds of obese land whales spamming Reddits front page for the last month.
$C: But they haven’t voted yet...
$C: Republicans are traitors to this nation.
$C: Fuck the FCC
$C: We could have easily black out reddit the day before the vote and we would have made national headlines, pushing the issue to the forefront of attention.

But no, money is more important and you can't even sacafrice one day to support a cause you want to claim to fight.
$C: /u/spez claims to be for a "free and open" internet but has, himself, censored posts on this forum and allows for the censorship of parties that his hive mind service disagrees with. But yeah, you're all "for it". 
$C: Look.

If you and Shit Pai get what you want, I have some news for you. 

I personally don't NEED the internet. 
I don't NEED a phone.
And I certainly don't NEED tv.
I don't NEED you.
Give me a reason to walk away. 
I'm tired of spending my time and money on you anyway.

I'm just one person. There are more out there that think just like I do. 

You WILL be hurting your bottom line by your own doing. 

I buy your product because it's a luxury that I do enjoy. However, I have absolutely NO problem cutting you out. 

You bastards won't see a dime from me anymore.


To anyone else reading this.

People of Reddit, Facebook,...the world really...

Here's your Life Pro Tip:
The BIGGEST "fuck you" is stop buying their product.
If you want to "make a change" it starts with your wallet.

Try it. Realistically, What are you out? 

You have the power. Money IS power. YOU.. have the power. 

You gain, they lose. Simple. 

A Shit Pie seems think you're stupid. 

Well....
Is he right? 


$C: Stop going to work. Stop spending money.   

Nothing will change until the poor actually do something. 
$C: They haven't voted yet but the FCC was just evacuated during AP speech 
$C: If FCC eliminates Net Neutrality then what would be the reddit package price?
$C: Wait what? I'm watching it live and the FCC hasn't finished the vote yet have they?
$C: the FCC IS A VIOLATION TO THE CONSTITUTION 
$C: Our next step is to start in the federal courts to block this horrific act by a corrupt administration. With the right legal work, we can perhaps block this long enough to allow the administration to go down in flames, something which will happen eventually. 
$C: I dont think calls, letters, comments, etc will do shit. they havent so far, they wont going forward. Ajit Pai and the republicans supporting him have made it abundantly clear they dont give a shit about your thoughts or opinions and will do what they want regardless. 

the only way to change this is by voting in people who will actually do something about this and undo what Pai has done. 
$C: And there it is...
$C: It was nice knowing all of you! 
$C: Guys, we now riot.
$C: It's absolutely astounding to me that so many politicians can get up and lie to the population.  Taxes, healthcare, and this.  Bold faced, flat out lying.

I'm done with these money grubbing self centered old assholes who don't care how many people they fuck over.  Public and private.  The system has become a sham, by the rich, for the rich.
$C: Goddamn it. 

$C: https://www.fcc.gov/general/live

$C: Sayonara boys, it's been fun. 
$C: Senators: we are the leaders of a democracy, this is what the people want.

Redditters everywhere: for fuck sake.


$C: Where is the funding for the lawsuit? I need to make a donation. 
$C: How is everyone commenting so decisively on a vote that didn't take place until after their comments? 

$C: ANNNNND ITS GONE!!
$C: (serious) Can this be changed with a new administration? 
$C: We are 100% done fighting.  There is and has never been anything a regular person can do
$C: I won't allow this stupidity to affect me. I will continue to encrypt all of my traffic with VPN, and if my ISP decides to block VPN then I will give them the middle finger and find an ISP who allows me to use VPN. Remember, our almighty dollar is how we control the ISPs. The government can't hold our hands. 
$C: the united states is a sinking ship, man. it's going the way of rome at this rate. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: They just raped us we said no and they forced it on us. goodbye freedom of speech on the internet. If you complain about the FCC or ISP's on a website you created your going to get shut down.
$C: It's ok.  There's a big blue tidal wave sweeping across America.  It's gonna wash the boomers and their shit out of our country once and for all.  We will right this ship.  I believe in us.
$C: Do not give up. We need to fight this.
$C: I wish for ajit pai to get a taste of poverty and no rights. Just so he can see his reckless ways and hopefully attempt to reverse the tragedy he has created
$C: [deleted]
$C: Hey Spez, what do you feel about silencing opposing views on Reddit? 
$C: this thread is being brigaded to shit
$C: Today would be a good day to cancel internet subscriptions. The companies you pay for the services you enjoy didn’t do fuck-all to help the cause here. If anything, they were all on the side of killing net neutrality because it will eventually help to increase their revenues. 

The best way to protest is with money. Cancelling your HBO, Netflix, Google Fiber, Verizon FIOS, Comcast, Spotify, iTunes Music, etc accounts sends a message. Once they start seeing their bottom line falling off, they will beg the FCC to go back to net neutrality. 

Show these companies you don’t need their services. Make them see and feel it in the pocketbook. When you cancel, let them know it’s because your internet no longer remains neutral, and you won’t be taken advantage of. 
$C: You mean all of Reddits astroturfing didn't work??!
$C: Hm. I guess I'll just be dropping Internet usage.  I make minimum wage and am already spending  $40 a month on Internet access. I'll be damned if i pay any more for access to certain website. 

This is precisely why tge cable industry is going under.  Because no one wants to pay outrageous prices for a bunch of crap they don't even want.   That's exactly what they'll turn the Internet into.

Screw that. 
$C: I'm floored that anyone actually thought that a bunch of petitions were going to stack up against piles of money changing hands to get what they want. Vote them out..Go ahead. I'm sure that the next bunch of thieves that get in will be different. Jesus, This is exactly the sort of thing they bank on us wasting our time with so that they can fuck us yet again.
$C: Remember not only what Republicans have done, because this is largely their fault, remember what these ISPs have done.  Remember how they took billions of dollars and failed to expand infrastructure.  Remember how they still take money from fees in your monthly bill, supposed to be used for expanding and upgrading infrastructure.  Remember how they used that money to buy off our politicians and use them against us, to preserve their monopolies so that they could exploit as much money as they could from the citizens of the United States.

And, when it is time, when it is possible get rid of these ISPs.  Start now, even, finding any way in which you can to give them less money.  But, don't forget, and when another option comes along, which it may very well, drop them.  These ISPs are arrogant, much like Blockbuster was, treating their customers horribly, taking advantage of them in anyway they possibly could.  One day, there will be an alternative, there will be a Netflix for ISPs to contend with, some technology or option that is good enough or far better than them, and never give them another penny.  Let them rot to the "LOL Netflix" that is coming their way.

As for right now, remember the politicians that sold you out at the voting booth, that cared far more for those ISPs than their own constituents.  Remember how little they sold you out for, literally pennies for every million the ISPs stand to make from these changes.
$C: !remindme 1 month
$C: Can someone tell me what the internet was like before this “net neutrality”?  I keep hearing how bad it will be, but yet to see proof. I really want to know....not trolling. 
$C: This is infuriating. I always thought democrats were the issue and maybe this proves me wrong. I understand they both have issues and depending on who you are hanging around can sway your political thought process, but this... this is bullshit! Almost all people voting for this are republicans and so many people are against this and no one listened. This is important enough to me to start writing letters and trying to clean these fuckers out of office.
$C: QQ. 
$C: Crooks.

Pai is cut from the same scumbag cloth as guys like Martin Shkreli. He is clearly in bed with telecom companies, as are the 3 clowns who voted in favor. 


I'm sick of sitting by while big business rapes Americans. The GOP is so obviously disgusting. At least, the Democrats occasionally attempt to hide their corruption.
$C: Coming from you that's hypocritical. Rules for them not for me.  Nice signalling. We know about the 'donation' /u/spez
$C: What a shitty country. I'd be ashamed to be an American.
$C: Can we all just agree that Republicans fucking suck?  I don't want to hear "we're the party of Lincoln",  the GOP has been the party of corporate greed and the NRA for decades now.  I'm ashamed of America.
$C: Silicon Valley is the biggest threat to the open and free internet, not Ajit Pai or even the ISPs. Every single day Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and YouTube are censoring opinions they dislike -- they're far more dangerous to the free Internet than this NN repeal. 

And yet it is considered a non-issue. I guess censorship is acceptable when it affects the people you disagree with?
$C: Save pornhub! 
$C: Ajit Pei is a piece of shit... And that’s an insult to shit.
$C: How about making reddit neutral inatead of punishing subs or removing them just because you dont like it.   
$C: It's amusing to see threads locked over mean words, but threads where violence is encouraged are ok.
$C: We should be rioting, and lynching politicians. 
$C: So, if somebody were to dox pai, and a bunch of disgruntled nerds went to his house and made him regret his decision, would that be a horrible thing? Would it? because he has done a lot of little harms to a lot of people. Would it be justice to have all those little harms added up and served right back in his face? Would it be a lesson to the people in power that you can't do shit like this without having personal repercussions? 

Because I think that it wouldn't be horrible at all. I think that if you disobey the will of the people like this, you should have a legit fear for your life. And I think that admins who would protect ajit pai, by saying stuff like no doxxing or shit like that are in the wrong, and that life in general will get worse in america unless we have the conversation about taking back power for the people from special interests and corporations. By force if necessary. Because the corporations have bought influence over the legal methods to take power back, and we no longer have the legal option. We have no voice. And if we don't fight to take power back, we might not have the ability to do so before long. 2nd amendment exists for a reason. 
$C: AJIT PAI is the biggest whitewashed Indian DORK, I’ve ever heard speak, did you see this idiot on Vice News Tonight? He’s got some kind of a learning disability, I think he walks on his tippy toes
$C: What an absolute disgrace. I thank God I live in Europe.
$C: Fuck you /u/spez 

You want net neutrality but don't demonstrate subreddit neutrality. Go back to editing user comments & stop virtue signalling unless you're willing to put your money where your mouth is.
$C: Get fucked cucks
$C: Stay strong American Internet user.
$C: On the bright side, we only have to live with this horse shit for a couple years. 
$C: Is anyone actually surprised at the outcome? They don't care how many letters you send or how many phone calls you make. It all means nothing if it doesn't serve their best interest. 
$C: Put The_Donald back on the front page.

You would've have 500k more people helping you. Seeing as you censor US, it was decided we would not help your cause to prevent the net neutrality overruling. 

You claim to want a free internet and free speech. 

Yet you censor us.

Enjoy your bundled internet packages. 
$C: Fuck that guy
$C: "Organic takeovers"

Lol. Multiple sub 1000 member subreddits making the top 100 hot posts for days. 
$C: But /u/spez you don't even treat all subreddits equally, if that's ok for you, why is it wrong for ISPs?

#DO AS I SAY ^^^not ^^^^as ^^^^^I ^^^^^^do ^^^^^^^....
$C: Send him an email, you wanna use mine, go for it. Here it is. 


Dear Ajit Pai,
Congratulations!
You are an asshole!

You did the exact opposite of what the 3.3 billion internet users wanted to do. The exact opposite of what America wanted you to do. Very common republican habit nowadays. Anways asshole, fuck you. Fuck your stupid policy. I didn’t need my internet to be any slower than it already was, it already takes me 40 goddam minutes to watch an episode of the Simpson’s. Also fuck you for not letting me see lots of stuff that’s on the Internet. Because fuck everybody anyways and fuck free speech and creativity. Nobody ever used that useless shit anyways. Fuck you for allowing the rich assholes to block anything they want. When you give rich people more power, it just makes everything better for everyone right? Thanks for fucking letting rich dickwads make more money off of payments from other rich dickwads so that you only get to see said Rich dickwads content. Fuck you in general. Even if you dismiss all this shit, WHAT THE FUCK IS THE POINT OF GETTING RID OF IT! You talk about how the internet isn’t goong to change. Okay, sure, but what’s the upside of removing these rules in the first place? Oh yeah. giving MORE MONEY TO THE RICH DICKWADS! What is your angle? Did Satan tell you to? Are you a deluded mental patient? Are you just a fucking asshole?

Fuck you. Really, fuck you. This comes from 3.3 billion people and this year’s 1.2 trillion google searches. FUCK YOU. FUCK YOU AND YOUR 3-2 INCH COCK!

Sincerely, FUCKING EVERYBODY
$C: Reddit: “WE NEED NET NEUTRALITY SO THAT ALL VOICES GET AN EQUAL SHARE!!!"

Also Reddit; “WE NEED TO BAN THE DONALD!!!”
$C: Why the fuck would you want net neutrality??? Give me liberty... from a bi male in the north east.
$C: You say you support a open internet, while you actively censor conservatives. LOL okay.
$C: >organic takeovers 

#HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH. Sure. 

Fuck you u/spez. You piece of shit.
$C: Wait, so what was the result of the vote so far?

I'm "in" the EU and on mobile so I have very few news sources talking about it and what I can find is mobile cancer
$C: I'm sorry, but calling and sending letters doesn't mean shit. They can vote however they like.

Just like the presidential election. The people's vote doesn't mean shit when the electoral college can vote however they want.
$C: The amount of lies and bile being spun and spewed by Ajit Patel sickens me. 
$C: You guys were disappointing this year. Barely any fight like sopa. 
$C: This is what happens when all you tards keep voting for Republicans, like most of you in about 30 states.  Maybe you'll stop now.
$C: I can't believe nobody assassinated Ajit, and I'm actually really disappointed. 
$C: The battle today may have been lost, but the war is just beginning. Do not lose heart, do your part, and do not give up until the end. We can win this fight, but we must be united and strong against the opposition.
$C: Next elections, we make these bastards pay.

Drown the red in a blue wave. Use the GOP's own tricks.

May all who voted against Net Neutrality never find happiness, true love, or future success. Also may they step on Lego bricks.
$C: Funny. I used the Internet for a quarter century without Net Neutrality and things were just fine, but, I guess after two years with it the internet is now dying. Lulz.
$C: The truth is, you're all letting this happen. Most of you are not willing to actually go do something about it. If nobody is willing to put their foot down there will be a point in time where everything is stripped away from you and the people have let themselves get devided to a point nobody can look past each others dfferences and are all left powerless to do anything at all.

Happy Holidays! 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Republicans, do the right thing for once and kill yourselves. It’s the only honorable thing left for you.
$C: Oh, great, can't wait to see post about net neutrality every fucking day 🙄
$C: We won you lost.  NN is a trojan horse . dont be sheep redditors
$C: Lol, Spez complaining about nutrality when his platform is anything but. Hypocrisy. 
$C: The next step is voting democrat in 2018.
The next step is voting democrat in 2018.
The next step is voting democrat in 2018.

Why do I have to keep repeating myself. The solution is obvious as this is a blatantly partisan issue. The democrats support net neutrality while the republicans are the ones that just gutted the regulation and yet it’s never mentioned directly in these god damned posts whining about it. ***The next step is voting democrats into the executive and legislative branches of government at the state and federal level***. If you didn’t vote in the last election or voted republican, this is your fault. If you want this problem solved…

***VOOOOOOOOOOTE DEMOCRAT***

EDIT: How cute. This comment is getting brigaded by republican trolls who cruise subreddits looking to make fun of "libruls". Don't believe the lies. Vote republican = no net neutrality. Vote democrat = net neutrality. It really is that simple.
$C: [deleted]
$C: You are full of shit /u/spez and you know it. I told you the other day this isn't going to change anything and what do you do? Open a new thread about it. Fuck off.
$C: >What is certain is that Reddit will continue to be involved in this issue in the way that we know best: seeking out every opportunity to amplify your voices and share them with those who have the power to make a difference.

Unless you post in subs we don't like, then /u/spez will edit your posts, but trust us we want authentic conversation, we totally promise.
$C: /u/spez, are you really for NN? Considering you can't even stop yourself from editing comments and censoring subreddits you don't agree with politically on reddit, how do you reconcile believing NN needs to exist?
$C: If this is true then why aren't you fighting FSB operations on your site? It comes across as selfish and not as activism when you selectively protect the internet only when it is in your financial best interest. 
$C: rip americans 

Edit sorry
$C: Lol. Reddit thought their sum was greater than their barista class parts. 

I’m against this vote. But it’s Hilarious how Reddit thinks being angry on the internet over something makes a difference in the real world. 

I guess u/spez and co are about to take a monetary haircut and pay a little more for bandwidth. Such is life.  Reddit is not special. Just another website and it costs money to make money. 
$C: DO NOT PAY. DO NOT PAY. 

When these new regulations go into effect, STOP BUYING INTERNET. STOP. 

It's the only way to hurt them.

$C: Spez eats babies

$C: if people just opened their eyes they would realize ajit pai is iron man's puppet. ugh.
$C: Reddit silver for whichever admin geoip blocks DC for the rest of the week.
$C: Live voting now
$C: Wait so, abit confused here but is it a done deal? Is Net Neutrality over? 
$C: So we lost.
$C: Let's be real, short of physically not allowing these people to pass this legislation nothing was going to work.

And no, I don't mean violence, I'm just articulating that they were going to pass this no matter what....now we get to see what the ISP's do with this.

I mean ffs, the ISP's are like any other corporation now...how fucking scary is that?  They connect us to the internet man....they can literally do whatever the fuck they want...it's insanity.
$C: Looks like it's time for a good old fashioned protest. 
$C: I’m going off the grid
$C: Land of the Free
$C: Questions that I'm unclear on:

* How much of the internet is owned/subsidized by the government?
* What is the ratio of usage to capacity at peak times (I'm picturing streaming at 6:00 PT/9:00 ET)...is the backbone capacity undersized or is it large enough to handle the inevitable growth in bitrate?
* Let's say these regulations stay, will there be metrics to show when unethical (as it won't be illegal anymore) throttling?
$C: join substratum now to save netneutrality
substratum.net
$C: Why won't the FCC just let me be

$C: Given the past 6-8 years, I have no faith that Congress will do anything for net neutrality. I just hope the courts can provide clarity on the role the Internet plays in everyone's life. This issue will make the 2018 congressional elections even more important. 
$C: Live FCC discussion https://www.c-span.org/video/?438447-1/fcc-vote-repealing-net-neutrality-rules
$C: We cannot trust Congress!  This cuts a cross ALL party lines.
$C: Shut up ~~Meg~~ Pai
$C: Jokes on them, I already downloaded my entire steam library.
$C: So do we have to pay to access websites now or what? I can't watch the live stream. 
$C: I suspect the court documents were filed within the hour.

TO WATCH THE DEBATE LIVE NOW ^^^
$C: Thanks spez
$C: Like Citizens United and other gross abuses of our rights by plutocracy: we are keeping a list, and we will reverse their crony corruption.




$C: FCC= Federal Careless Commission
$C: So net neutrality is gone?
$C: Can someone clarify what Title 2 really does, because it seems like the main reasons people are using to keep it in place are ISP's blocking and throttling sites at will, and controlling what there customers can access. But they stated that Title 2 does not even prevent that at all, and if ISP's wanted to they could do that, but they don't because they know their customers wouldn't tolerate it. Is the pro repeal side just blatantly lying here? Or is there misinfo on both sides?
$C: [deleted]
$C: Can we get a comprehensive explanation of results? Discussing with some friends and itd be nice to have a clear explanation from someone who understands all of it. Tyty 
$C: No Star Wars spoilers in this one!
$C: Someone wanna be a martyr and literally take a shit on Pai
$C: We the Corporations of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union,..
$C: > Congress can decide to take up the cause and create strong, enforceable net neutrality rules that aren’t subject to the political winds at the FCC.

Hate to be a pessimist but... Congress is majority Republican, and many of whom already expressed support to rolling the regulations back... Most of those opposed were Democrats or Independents, and won't be able to do much more than push propositions that likely won't get voted on, even.
$C: Was the internet that much different in 2012 or 2013?
$C: Why do you need "incredible activism" if you have legalized corruption
$C: I'm surprised neither parties didn't "accidentally" die in a car crash yet.

$C: We are so screwed 
$C: we're so fucked
$C: writing letters and calling doesnt seem to work. 

we have to stop being defensive about this and start an active movement to open the internet globally. 
$C: So you admit you're biased? 
$C: Honesty, I do not believe there are valid grounds to challenge net neutrality in court. What we need is a law to enshrine it if we want it to stay.
$C: In 2020 if the WH comes back with a pro NN pres and appoints a new lead to FCC, can't they just put the rules back in to place?
$C: a
$C: Treason most foul.
$C: So when nothing happens that the fearmongers said would, do you congratulate yourselves because you think you did something, or apologize for being dishonest? 

LOLOL

Like that would happen. 

Enjoy the internet like it was before 2015. 
$C: You are literally just spreading misinformation but I can't filter you
$C: Honest question, now that ISPs think they're in the clear can we turn it around on them and pressure the FTC to do it's job and break up the local monopolies they have? Can we get the FTC the break the few major players so we have real competition? I feel that if we want to rely on "market forces" there needs to be competition. 
$C: We need to riot in the streets. Enough of this calling our representatives, they obviously don’t give a shit.  
$C: Can you post announcements after the event occurs next time? I mean, although ***very*** unlikely, one or more of the commissioners could have swung during the actual voting stage.
$C: Americans, you guys need to pickup your fucking bullshit and reap chaos before other countries follow suit.
$C: We fight for each other. Linking arms and putting our foot down after we get destroyed by evil spirits. 
$C: [Here's your internet after this, folks.](https://youtu.be/FzulhVjliU4)
$C: Let's keep fighting, this repealing of Net neutrality was so unconstitutional, they just stepped on everyone's rights and didn't listen to the American people
$C: Security told them to stop speaking and leave, wonder what's going on. Hope everyone's okay
$C: bring back irc if it gets repealed
$C: How about we discuss why we let a non-elected group of people interpret half-assed laws passed in congress?  
FCC should not be making any laws.  That’s the job of House and Senate.  We elect them.  They write laws while directly representing the people.  FCC, EPA, and their kin somehow create regulation (a fucking LAW) without it being vetted in House and Senate.
$C: You actually have to play fair and not take unlimited bandwidth? Poor, poor milionare. 
$C: this is sad, frustrating and overall very disappointing. 
$C: DID THEY HAVE A SECURITY BREACH?>
$C: I'm cancelling my Comcast subscription for as long as I can hold out.
$C: Serious question, how  can a law be made and implemented to keepnet neutrality once and for all?
$C: "Democracy"
$C: With a new chair in a few years can they repeal the repeal? 
$C: Don't ever stop fighting America, net neutrality in the USA affects the whole world. We're counting on you. 
$C: [deleted]
$C:  >  today’s vote is the beginning

Not even close.  This fight has been going on forever and it won't end; we all need to face up to that fact.

There is evidence of fraud and other criminal activities in support of this FCC travesty.  The Justice Department should at least investigate the process and publish any and all findings.
$C: I hate to say this but I knew this was coming.  The money is all they care about and I have read up on their stances and I knew this.  Sorry everyone.
$C: Well once twitter's gone I'll just put the stories of what a evil piece of filth Ajit Pai is in cave paintings for my children to read one day.
$C: If they keep this up they do realize that they're setting horrible things in motionn. I don't know much politically but I can assume that with all these extra payments and heightened prices, that they will end up having to raise minimum wages again. And won't that kind of throw the USA into more debt. Even if it doesn't that would screw a lot of small businesses.
$C: >Organic Takeovers

uh... Ok.
$C: Why can't you guys just boycott Verizon or something? 
$C: Sad to see even though I’m not from the USA especially since other countries could follow suit soon. 
$C: Such bullshit. I'm fucking ashamed to be an American. So much for "Draining the swamp." Our government is lousy with corrupt pieces of filth like Pai.
$C: Meanwhile, reddit is now defaulting accounts to give up their data so that they can sell it to Microsoft and Co. 
$C: The FCC is having a meeting on net neutrality. Watch via their website: https://www.fcc.gov/general/live  Or Twitch:
$C: Congress is the only way this gets solved for good. The problem with relying on executive fiat to accomplish your policy goals is that the next administration can just as easily undo all your policy goals. This has happened to the Obama administration again and again - this is only the latest example.


Write your Congress representatives! Make this an issue in the midterms! Get laws on the books protecting Net Neutrality instead of agency rules! 
$C: Of course he did. He's a cholo trying to get a job for when he's inevitably fired by Joe Biden.
$C: did they just fucking finish voting
$C: Remember everyone we need to keep it up don't stop
$C: It’s time for a serious Revolt against Internet service providers! 
$C: Can someone please explain to me what is net neutrality in a simple way
$C: This sucks.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Keep the fight going

$C: Update cause I just got here, is the vote officially some? Results?
$C: man it takes a lot of theater to get short term unrealistic shareholder gains these days 
$C: Shit, I already clicked agree to Charter's new "agreement" thingy
Hmm, I wonder what happens in the coming weeks for my wonderful internet experience now?!
$C: i'm crying
$C: File complaints with the FCC against Ajit Pai? He's obstructing our services. So I don't see how it isn't a valid complaint.

fcc.gov/consumers/guides/filing-informal-complaint
$C: Our rights just got sold out from under us. To the telecom companies. Our words wont do anything as they have proven to us. Once they take away our guns the only thing we will be able to do is bend over for the corrupt cops that will point guns at us and our children.
$C: Next step: Boycott Verizon. Ajit Pai makes Verizon the obvious, easy target.

To elaborate: The whole point of this is that Verizon invests over $10 million/year in lobbying the U.S. Government. They expect a big return to justify this hefty investment. If the result of the getting rid of net neutrality is that customers flock to other companies, then Verizon will rethink their strategy, either reducing their lobbying efforts, or ironically lobbying to put net neutrality back in place to shore up their sagging bottom line.

The political process didn't work. So now we have to use economics to make it work.

So spread the word. I understand that many people have no choice but to use Verizon FIOS. But if you know anyone who has a choice, you can try to convince them to switch their cell service to T-mobile for example, which is friendlier towards net neutrality than Verizon. In CA - switch to Sonic which is much more friendlier towards net neutrality than AT&T. Etc.

We can also do negative PR campaigns on Verizon. I will post an image of the sign I carried outside a Verizon store in a few minutes . . .
$C: Quick look inside the Room that has been evacuated

$C: I literally don’t fucking get it. We have no say. I’m just at a lost 
$C: Did Ashit Pie hire someone to laugh at all his jokes. That guy seemed too happy.
$C: What can a furious European do to help you guys? 
$C: How can ppl from other countries help? I can see this coming to europe! It has to be stopped right there right now, otherwise this may spread.
$C: u/arabscrarab,

How long do you expect the Appeals Courts process to take? Months? Years?
$C: Did...Did we lose?
$C: BOMB  THREATS
$C: Thank you so much for sharing this information. People need to know.

$C: As a Canadian, is there anything I can do?
$C: I don't know why limit people's access to the internet. Even thought internet is the nasty place but it doesn't mean people have to pay for it. If this happen, people will be less advantage. Although it is not explicitly but I think they are violated our first amendment- Freedom of press. I strongly disagree.
$C: Fuck that snek Pai.  Fuck our current government.  
$C: Thank 4chan for the bomb threat.
$C: Our voices mean nothing, Our petitions mean nothing. Anyone who thinks things can be done through our corrupt government are being cucked.
$C: i was trying to follow this while at work.. let me see if i have this right... His argument is that major ISP's are being hurt buy the decline of high speed internet package purchases and cannot get the financing to build newer better networks. I pay 240 a month for cable and internet, that's more then my car payment! So roughly translated = " We need more $ to continue to build our monopolies and control everything because you cheap asses wont pay our already absurd prices, so we want to take control and FORCE you to pay even higher prices under the guise of making a better internet!" Is this about right?
$C: I'm feel so sorry for you guys. I'm from the Netherlands and I'm just a month back from my 2 month trip to the USA. It was amazing, the people I've met were great. I felt really welcome and had so much fun.

I cannot imagine anyone doing the things Pai & Co did. Not only did he possibly destroy the internet as we know it, he created so much negativity and chaos for everyone connected to America. He betrayed the voice of the people, used his influence simply to gain money. 

I can imagine the corporate identity of America has taken a lot of damage by this decision. This is basically an attack on democracy and free speech. 

I wish I could have a bigger impact to help you guys out, but for now you gotta do it. Know we've got your back! 

**Keep fighting this!**
$C: If only throttling our games was their end-game. Fucking greedy corporate fuck permitting to stab free speech in the gut.
$C: Could we do any damage to anyone important pocket book if we organized a national day to cancel your cell phone/cable/internet services. Everyone all at once would have to get our voices heard.
$C: Anyone in Louisiana who was against it? I wish there would be a post in the future as a reminder who you should vote against in your state or whatever. 
$C: So is net neutrality gone now? Or is it just expected to be gone?
$C: Just waiting for my new internet bill and inevitable cancelation of services
$C: I only have one question: since Net Neutrality is only repealed in the US, is there the possibility that this might also happen in Europe?
$C: I’m of the opinion that we should all call our local providers at a set gmt time every day to complain to the customer Service reps about their part in this.  If you’re using any of the providers who paid lobby against net neutrality, we should all them every day for a month and complain to them about how this is wrong.  

Over load their call centers with this for a month.  Let the voices be heard directly to the companies tell them they are doing wrong.
$C: Its so obvious that this is pro big companies and against everyone else, how is there nothing we can actually do, if ever I considered the govt corrupt its now
$C: So I guess we need to take note of the FTC and be prepared to take action through them if need be?  Is that how I am reading all this right?
$C: Guys these are the companies that don't pay taxes! These are the companies that take away rights don't follow the law! The politicians that get in power get that way because they are bought out. The only thing we can do is protest or else our voices and words will not be cared about
$C: Would it be possible to agitate for a law forbidding Ajit Pai and other FFC board members from profiting from their votes?
$C: That's it, It's done. INTERNET RIP.
$C: Well that was expected. No amount of groundwork by common folk could have swayed this vote. 

For the dollar, by the dollar....
$C: I know you say we aren't done fighting but I think people are.  I was on the streets on the 7th.  Maybe 100 showed up in Philly.  The most activism I am seeing is spending a few seconds typing comments and hitting an upvote.  Yeah, there are a few of us who are passionate and loud but that is not going to be enough anymore.  I am starting to doubt whether the general public has the stomach or even cares anymore.
$C: Okay that one is gone. Now we need a new one.
$C: Can the FCC be sued?
$C: So they won to get rid of it?
$C: ETHEREUM BABY YOUR TIME TO SHINE.
$C: Whelp, there goes that engine for economic drive. 

Maybe this is a chance for the [Minitel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minitel) resurgence?
$C: So what happens now?
$C: So what next?
$C: Can someone notify if and when the vote passes
$C: To View this comment you‘ll have to pay your gov, your ISP, germany and my ISP.

Is that the actual state (which hopefully is beeing challenged)?
$C: So what does this mean right now? I’m worried, I don’t want to have to pay extra money to just use the Internet, is there anything we can do? 
$C: [deleted]
$C: So, repealing NN theoretically should allow ISPs to compete is one of their arguing points? Does this mean Google Fiber will be able to finally compete outside of major cities now? I wish things were this simple.
$C: Write to your Government Representatives about Net neutrality

-We have been doing this there is no way to stop it, unless we start a go fund and pad their pockets
$C: THATS IT BOYS ABANDON INTERNET! WE GOTTA MAKE A NEW ONE AJIT PAI HAS DONE GONE AND ADDED THOSE ZEROS TO HIS BANK ACCOUNT! AMERICA IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE BASTION OF DEMOCRACY AS IT LABELED ITSELF THROUGH THE COLD WAR AGAINST COMMUNISM, BUT ALL I SEE IS REPULSIVE CORRUPTION OF FASCIST LIKE CONTROL!, WE MUST STAND UP TO THIS! MAKE IT KNOWN THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE THIS TAKE A STAND! MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD THE DEMOCRACY OF AMERICA IS FAILING AND WE CANNOT STAND IDLE AND LET THIS HAPPEN! THE MEN AND WOMEN YOU HAVE VOTED IN HAVE FAILED TO REPRESENT YOU! THE ONE WHO VOTED THEM IN AND THEY ARE TO REPRESENT THIS IS THE PRIME EXAMPLE OF HOW WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN! 
$C: Farewell 
$C: I say we should of had a vote by the people and not of one from a former Verizon employee who was biased from the beginning. This would of let an actual vote take place and not a bunch of corrupt politicians work for their money's worth after company's paid them.
$C: [removed]
$C: [deleted]
$C: Can anyone explain, in detail, what course of action can be taken to correct misconduct in the future if these ISPs decide to censor the internet and how Title II actually stopped small ISPs from expanding their networks? As far as I know those are literally just lies that these people are spouting. 
$C: Yes we are done. We were done since the beginning. You actually think it'd make a difference and the people would be heard? If we believe we could make a difference we probably should believe in Santa too. This the season after all. 
$C: Why not fight to break up the ISP monopolies and bandwidth caps? 
$C: Gentlemen, it has been an honor...

(Plays "Nearer My Heart to Thee" on a MIDI)
$C: Why oh why 
$C: Really odd this was posted when it was.
$C: Isn't there a petition to the white house that got all and more of the votes needed? Not taken in consideration I'm sure. Nothing gets taken in consideration no matter what it's said because we can't pay them enough to buy their votes. Sadly said. But there's hope. Don't give up 
$C: Lets just make a new internet
$C: FUUUUUUUUCK!!!
$C: PEOPLE PROTEST THIS they are pushing you down 
$C: Remember [Netflix PAYS Verizon and Comcast](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/186576-verizon-caught-throttling-netflix-traffic-even-after-its-pays-for-more-bandwidth) for bandwidth.

They may pay the other ISPs too.  Remember, if they try to charge extra for a package that includes Netflix, let them know you think it's bullshit that they get paid twice, by you and by Netflix so it can reach your house.
$C: As mod of /r/familyman I saw we are officially against this recent fcc decision
$C: ELI5? I’m confused 
$C: So did that Ajit guy win or lose?
$C: I think the thing that's _most_ frustrating about this is not actually the NN repeal, but how easily Republican politicians can say "hey fuck you buddy" to the entire country and get away with it. It's the very specific, very overt nature of how corrupt this entire fiasco has been with Ajit Pai and all the pro-repeal congresspeople having received hefty paychecks from big telecom companies (this is demonstrable, there is empirical evidence). 

It's like, Republicans can just flaunt how corrupt they are and nobody in their electorate gives a shit. They continue to vote them in! The smear campaign against the idea that all liberal ideas are bad ideas has worked so well. These people have insulated themselves so much that child molesters are only considered marginally worse than liberals. It disgusts me.
$C: So how long until they put the net neutrality repeal into place? How long until we see the internet being throttled?
$C: anarchy?
$C: Good thing I learned how to run circumventors in High School to look at restricted sites. I'll just tell them that I'm in India.

$C: A noob question,  what was internet like before net neutrality in USA. P.S. I moved to usa in 2016

People must also make sure that when this is done, it is done right! No last minute amendments to fuck everything up
$C: How can I, as someone in CA whose representatives are all democrats, for net neutrality, do something about this? I feel more helpless.
$C: Other than complaining to representatives that clearly couldn't care less about us, what else can we honestly do to fight this?
$C: America is dead.

If you've got the money then free access to internet?

$C: I say we refuse to pay are taxes they can get it from the 400 billion WE PAID IPS for fiber cable.

$C: Anonymous, just hack these ppl for the rest of their lives.
$C: Yes you are. 

And while you were all bitching about this fox turned Peter griffin into a Disney princess. 
$C: We lost the vote
$C: Is there any way we can join together as citizens to sue the FCC and any cable company that accepted government money in return for building cable infrastructure that was never implemented?

It's 2017, social media and crowd-sourcing are on fire -- can we use these tools to make our voices heard, given they seem to fall on deaf ears within our own government?

We need to build an electronic crowd-sourcing platform, partnered with lawyers, to aggregate citizens in lawsuits against government agencies and/or companies who promote legal action against the best interests and desires of the majority of the voting/tax-paying population.

Thank you for reading.
$C: If USA repeals NetNeutrality, every internet provider in their mother's womb will try to repeal it in their countries. USA isn't just trying to save their asses, they are working for all of us. 

Please save the internet! We are getting fucked as it is! 
$C: "...The number one complaint is not that ISPs are throttling content..." Maybe because of the net neutrality rules that prevent this from happening?
$C: Won’t the house have to vote on it??
$C: Save it for 2020, we don't have enough people that give a shit in DC right now, and until we do this is all futile. Alabama is the first domino, voting is all we can do. 
$C: As a Canadian is there anything I can do besides raise awareness? 
$C: imagine thinking your officials are gonna be swayed by a bunch of emails over lobby money.

its over
$C: Its always easier to pass laws on the local level. Can municipal governments pass consumer protection laws like no throttling, no price differentation, no different speeds for different websites? Or would such laws get thrown out in court?
$C: It's getting really irritating seeing those who are suppose to vote for the people's wants/needs only worrying about what makes them money. You're a F*@king public servant of the people not leading authority.   
$C: Well, it was fun while it lasted boys. See you... Outside?

$C: It seems like Net Neutrality prevailed the last time around because we had the support of large internet companies like Netflix. Has anyone considered pressuring them to join the fight? If enough people canceled or suspended their Netflix account and sent a note saying that they are doing it because of Netflix's absence from the net neutrality fight, I bet we could get their attention. 
$C: Well fuck 
$C: I'm curious and genuinely asking the question because I don't understand. How many damned times has a version of this come up and been voted down/against until today? It seems strangely repetitive that we keep having to say no and rally support for something in such a short amount of time. 
$C: ....aaaand they're FUCKED.
$C: Well we’re fucked.
$C: They may take our internet neutrality! But they may never take away..OUR FREEDOM!
$C: I am LITERALLY SHAKING right now!
$C: how is everyone so shocked that this happened? “but... we sent emails! we called! why didn’t they listen?!” what did you think was going to happen...? the government hardly listens to us. how is that a shocker? you’re very naive if you genuinely thought calling, texting, emailing, ect would do ANYTHING.

$C: Ok so now let's just kill the internet and make something better
$C: Elections have consequences 
$C: Well, pretty disappointing. I’m disappointed that large companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Google were not active or aggressive enough to stop this from happening. 

So well, I hope we see all of their profits fall. We needed these companies to be consumer advocates, and they let us down.
$C: I wonder how trumptards feel now voting for trump 
$C: How about we get the ISP monopolies dismantled? End data caps! Unlimited Bandwidth! 100 Mbps+! instead of fighting for the ISP keeping their bs stranglehold over the internet.
$C: Actually, when you think about it, were gonna need them to infringe on our rights a bit more before the public finally takes it all back. We will only tolerate so much and it feels like we're dangerously close to the moment where we snap back. 
$C: Alright, as an worried outsider, when do we have the result of the whole voting? 

Like, the verdict.
$C: Is there any central organization or website one could submit information to in order to build evidence for a potential court battle?
$C: Christ....... Eliminate ALL personal information that you can from the internet NOW. 
$C: Ahhhhhh!!!! Pai was bribed in my mind... By isps
$C: '''organic''' takeovers 


riiiight
$C: Gawd. It's the end of the world as we now it.
$C: Just another thing our Normal President Obama did to help Americans, this administration is going to destroy it to help the wealthy make more money and have control on us. Thanks for voting for a reality show douche bag. 
$C: Will there be a legal challenge soon? IANAL but if the FCC really didn't investigate fake comments on NN, that may be grounds for halting the decision. Legally they are required to seek public input and have a commenting period before making new regulations. I'd take them to court and argue they didn't do this in good faith.
$C: As a German, how will this affect me? Can I expect Germany to follow suit?
$C: did they really just force the media out when they were voting? what a bunch of cunts
$C: i'm confused, if so many people didn't want it to happen then why did it this ajit pai fucker needs to ajit dai
$C: Let’s keep fucking fighting. 
$C: Pretty clear there's one path towards NN, and that is the mid-term elections... 
$C: sell all your sd-wan gear
$C: The net neutrality repeal is a perfect example of politicians being bought and sold by corporations
$C: Then we will just keep on fighting FCC. Come on guys we can do it.
$C: rebbit BTFO
$C: **Once it goes to court**

File ALL THE AMICUS BRIEFS!!!!

(Fun Fact: The spelling suggestion for "amicus" is "islamic")
$C: Keep us updated on the apocalypse that will occur. It's amazing how the internet even existed before 2014 without net neutrality! 
$C: Surprising.
$C: At this point, how are we ever going to win? The government couldn't give a rat's ass about what we want. This is just one step closer to keeping us in line. 
$C: washington doesn't want it https://twitter.com/GovInslee/status/941075518924865536
$C: Canadian here. I am very sad to hear this but not overly surprised. It's sad how much power is given to companies these days. We will all feel the effects of this I'm sure somehow. I am definitely siding with the public on this without question. Good luck and hopefully someone comes to their senses that is in power... Sooner than later preferably. 
$C: I never thought Ajit Pai would be able to trick citizens into also wanting to get rid of net neutrality. Then I went to the donald subreddit.
$C: Gentlemen, it has been a pleasure memeing with you tonight. 

Edit: As a Canadian, that was more of a « see you around », than anything tbh. But I thought I’d come back and link [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/7jt3ji/as_the_us_retreats_canada_doubles_down_on_net/?st=JB6U8NTZ&sh=8257efac) , Canada’s Just re-affirmed stance on Net Neutrality, in the hopes that the article may have some use for those of you constructing arguments. 

Our PM had taken a lot of shit for some his decisions, but one thing I really appreciate is how quickly he’s jumped on the Net Neutrality preservation. In general, he’s been fantastic at not letting USA current issues seep into us up here. 

Right now America seems like some parody of freedom. I hope you guys can seize that image we think of when we think « free America » again. 
$C: Spin up the lawsuits, time to pray the courts are not blinded by bullshit and money.
$C: It was and will continue to be a valiant effort but it’s an unwinnable battle. 
$C: https://ipfs.io/
$C: Told you it was fucking delusional to think the public had any say. here in the EU we have specific laws preventing this from happening so it wont affect us.
$C: Credit to Reddit for posting this.
$C: Seriously votes matter... if you want to know the rep you have and their stance and who their opponent is either reply here or pm me and I’ll let you know on where to volunteer and how to help 
$C: /r/NoNetNeutrality
$C: Will VPNs be made illegal/inaccessible now that net neutrality is dead?
$C: Would it be possible to protest by making the internet go Dark? I mean, everyone stop using it personally for as long as possible? It seems different and hard to do such a thing, but would it be possible?
$C: My history teacher just yelled at me and said this isnt Pais fault, rather ours by bit exercising our right to vote...
$C: Well the fact that I have to move, which costs even more of my time and money to change providers is a major issue. Free trade market can’t be well run by “land” monopolies that saturate large areas.
$C: Wow. I just finally read through this and understand what this means now. How can they possibly do this? Wouldn't this be considered unconstitutional on account of freedom of speech and access to information?
$C: It is also up to the States to protect your rights to the internet. States have more power than people think. Esp. States with large amount of resources like the coastal states. Get your message to your state and local reps. 
$C: I’m kinda confused when will it go into place
$C: The argument I've been hearing has been "It'll force people to talk to one another again" which just doesn't wash with me at all.  The biggest take away is that we got sold out by a corporate shill who did it to get a few more zero's in his bank account.  
$C: They did it. The absolute madmen.
$C: It's over.
$C: Been fun guys.
$C: I have a question... Where was Anonymous or any other entity like that during all of this? Am I outdated in my information and they got caught or something? 
$C: I wouldn't mind net neutrality if the companies that owned the internet fiber were not the same companies that provided internet. If one company rented out their fiber (at regulated rental rates) to dozens of internet companies then I would be ok with the free market doing it's thing. But in s monopoly situation this just doesn't make sense. 
$C: So we won or lost?
$C: So I am pretty ignorant on the effects this will actually have in practice, but couldn't a company (like Google for example) just say fuck that and keep giving us internet the same way they have been? If this is the case, wouldn't Google just keep giving us great internet and EVERYBODY would switch to them resulting in a huge loss for the cable companies?
$C: what is particularly unsettling is that, in the face of clear overwhelming opposition from the american people who are the very consumers his agency exists to protect, there was complete disregard for the agencies purpose in favor of corporations that verifiably paid for this "vote". With the tax bill being rammed through our legislative process facing the same opposition from the american people and many in congress, symbolizing a gigantic middle finger to everyone, one had to wonder. when this goes to the next stages and congress and the courts decide what will happen to net neutrality...will the american people get the middle finger from the republicans again? 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Yeah we're not done.  It's just, you know, you can't fight a dictatorship.  See you on the other side of 2020.
$C: Momma I’m scared 
$C: remember folks, no matter what way you fall on this you are pawns in a corporate game. have fun!
$C: Is modifying their TOS to allow throttling considered a materially adverse change? I’m under contract with AT&T currently.
$C: Guess all that brigading for nothing.
$C: I think it's time to reevaluate my party stance
$C: there is no democracy in a republic capitalistic system..... only a image of such. Money talks bullshit walks.
$C: The government is bought by the highest bidder these days. You have no control unless you are very rich. 
$C: Is there a way i can help From Canada?
$C: People need to vote.  Simple as that.  Vote for the candidates who will implement policies that you want.  You can't just complain and write letters to get your way in politics.  If people were as passionate about voting as they are about Net Neutrality, then we wouldn't be in this situation to begin with.    
$C: I don't want to place blame on anyone for this. It isn't what our community did or didn't do; it was never in our hands. Ajit Pai and company had no intentions to ever listen to us, they were going through with this vote regardless. There was so much voiced against repealing NN, though, it was still repealed. We the people need to find a better way to be heard, we need to form an alliance, #TakeToTheStreets
$C: In the likelihood that net neutrality does indeed die, and perhaps even if it does not, what if we put some more effort into educating the massing on how to encrypt all their traffics. Though I understand that encryption is not a silver bullet if ISPs decide to block encrypted traffic.
$C: The fight isnt over.
$C: I agree with her but Clyburn does NOT know how to use a comma.  I got frustrated reading her statement. 
$C: **REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESIST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**
$C: Everyone in the comments of the YouTube livestream from the Washington post were spamming “rush B” when the building was evacuated.
$C: Resist. Fight. Get violent if you have to. That's all they understand. 
$C: For the nth time... I just emailed my state senators and local congresswoman! Fight goes on...
$C: Please. Tell me what reason I have to live now. The internet was my one security. Please help me!
$C: This is a sad day 😔 
$C: Going against the American people like this should be a crime and should be investigated.  If they hid information, lied about information, or anything they should go to jail. I’m tired of these Republicans digging in my pockets. 
$C: Fucking corporate shills at the fcc
$C: Everyone you are going about this wrong. Don't tell you representative that you will not vote for them if they let this get repealed. Tell them you will donate to thier relecetion fund if they don't let it get repealed.  Very few governement representatives care about you they just want to hold onto thier seats, so use thier greed against them.

$C: I really hope Ajit pai gets whats coming to him someday for being so horrible to the people.
$C: My favorite part was being ushered out of the room due to a security concern. Fun times.
$C: Yawn.  Let’s build systems around the corrupt dinosaurs until they are 100% irrelevant.   
$C: If one, or even a few half decent ISPs decided to be net Neutral, surely everyone would subscribe to them and all the cunty ISPs pushing this bullshit would lose millions or change their approach to neutrality?  Or is that wrong? 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Be a shame if maybe people in the DC area realized his wife is a physician. Be a shame if maybe they protest outside her office and disrupt her daily business. Be a real shame if her anger made it home and she took it out on her dip shit husband. He literally doesn't care about anything that's happened yet.
$C: Are you done providing a breeding ground for Neo-Nazis? 
$C: Mignon Clyburn is a true mvp 
$C: Let the lawsuits begin.
$C: :(
$C: We should treat Ajit Pai and those associated on this ruling the same way some people have treated Martin Shkreli after gouged drug prices. 
$C: So when can I expect to notice changes, my city recently upgraded to cable internet now I'm worried im going to lose everything again 
$C: I think they were going to repeal it no matter what. They don’t care about what the American people wants. They only care about lining their own pockets. 
$C: Lol that kinda stuff only works in a government run by the people, for the people.
Y'all don't have that.

Edit: mobile autocorrect is awful
$C: Quit spreading propaganda people.  
$C: When all else fails, it's time to get violent.
$C: This whole thing could have been avoided if the courts had allowed FCC to enforce open internet on Title I corps.
It's a sham.
$C: We will never be done fighting
$C: Send checks not letters. 
$C: I agree we shouldn't be discouraged but if there was anyone left with a shred of doubt that our government has abandoned the will of it's people for the cooperations here's your proof. 
$C: /r/NoNetNeutrality has like, 600 people in it now.

You can't make this shit up, it's like saying Twinkies are organic.
$C: So tired...
$C: Trump, maybe if you cleaned the swamp like you said l, this wouldn’t happen 
$C: Where I come from, Pai can be called as The Chutiya. 
$C:  Next step is helping ISP startups in rural areas compete. Getting rid of net neutrality is a great first step.
$C: Has anyone figured out how much Ajit Pai stands to make from this decision monetarily? Promises of jobs, kickbacks, etc?
$C: I'm trying not to get discouraged but this is so disappointing. It is nice to see the absolute majority of us working together and trying to prevent this fucking disaster. 
$C: PREDICTIONS When you guys think they will start actual datacaps or packages. Two years?
$C: Dont write down why you want net neutrality on here write it down on paper and send it to congress! Talking and complaining on here is completely useless in the fight against net neutrality repeal!

Take action!
$C: The fight isn't over.  

Forward people!  Lets take the next hill!
$C: furiously downloading porn. god forbid, if they take it away/block it i will single handly deliver it to my fellow man! and lady! taking request! (not really)
$C: I'm really surprised no one traded 1 for 1 with Ajit. 
$C: How could the government allow such an injustice to befall its citizens? We're supposed to be moving forward and getting better not going back and getting worse. This decision is incredibly unsettling. This does not foreshadow an easy future.
$C: What ever happened to armed revolution against an unjust government or corporate organization. That’s what got things done in the past. That or an actual massive in person face to face protest. Like the civil rights movement. 
$C: Time to start a new Underground Railroad in Canada? We can run our Fibre secretly into the States. You’ll have to pay ridiculous prices to Bell and Rogers but at least it will be neutral!

I’ll just need $400bn to start my underground information superhighway please.
$C: This is an actual fucking nightmare. 
$C: This is frustrating, what are others ways to take action? Someone organize a rally/protest!?
$C: Rational, respectful discourse is nearly dead in America, and every last one of us is to blame. It's unfortunate how mean spirited we all feel we have to be about one another's politics. 
$C: The internet is now gonna be like how I take shits. Really depends on the amount of cheese I eat, the laxatives I take, and the effort I take to not have explosive diarrhea  or constipation. Smooth sliding turds. or blocked passage and pain.
$C: Man, won't the FCC feel stupid when we all need to start watching our internet porn at public libraries, granted that they will be able to keep their free internet as well, which they may not.
$C: Fuck the GOP and the FCC. It's sickening how corrupt our government is, all these people could die and I would not care because the world will be a better place without them. Disgusting human beings.
$C: So true

$C: Sold my stocks.  Getting out before the crash.
$C: Honestly do you think any of them care? They didn't care BEFORE and they still voted. $$ talks to these people. Not calls, emails, letters, etc. Our Government needs to change now! 
$C: As I’ve said before this will soon enough follow in the UK and the rest of the world because they have gotten away with it in NZ and now the US. I just hope our lot put up a good fight like you guys have, 
Corruption at its finest and sorry you guys are being governed by a bunch of money hungry sharks not that we’re any different 
$C: I think maybe I'll start shooting down phone lines and destroying cable boxes around town. Maybe that'll let the telecommunication companies and government know how I feel instead of writing my limp-dicked representative for the 12 trillionth time.
$C: Hold up though. According to those against net neutrality, without it, the internet becomes untouchable by the government! If that's true, that's a good thing! Take that government! You have no power here! /s
$C: Let's all unify and fix this, let's not separate and throw blame. It's over, but as Americans we have a say in how things go. So let's do something, not complain.
$C: *invests in comcast* :[
$C: How long will it be before we see major changes from ISPs?
$C: So, has America broken the internet for everyone in the world, or just themselves? 
$C: Ok, can someone do a Tl;Dr for me? I've heard arguments for both sides and I'm still confused.

People for the repeal say that the current state of internet ruins and ibterupts a free market economy.

But... This would mean access to websites would be completely dictated by corporations like Verizon, Comcast, etc. and required paid "packages" to "unlock" them?

I understand the backlash, but I'm still very confused by this whole situation, and understanding this wrong could be the exact opposite what it really is.


$C: Literally the whole fucking reddit and all other subreddit's were about Net Neutrality. Apparently that clearly wasn't a sign to them because they don't give a fuck.  
$C: So are we fucked? Everything i read i dont understand.
$C: So, when is it appropriate to turn to violence against these politicians?

When it becomes apparent that we can't get them out of their positions of power with just voting, or stop them from completing their evil plan?
$C: Yes we are. There never was a fight, lol. didn't do shit about anything else, why would this be any different? Go back to posting memes
$C: I knew I should’ve stayed on my alt login today. This is absolutely ridiculous.
$C: We have to have legislation passed to protect it, and that sadly won't happen until we can vote away the Republican's currently seated.  This is evident in the form letters everyone gets back from Republican officials. At this point they don't even think about it critically; support of a repeal is just second nature to them.  In the long run if we don't have legislation to protect it every time someone is in office who supports big buisness will work to repeal it.


$C: I partly understand this issue and have heard arguments from both sides that sound legitimate but I don't know whether to be mad or curious about this. Can someone help me out?
$C: Tell me again how this is the greatest country
$C: Dear free Internet.  Today you were stolen from those who loved you by those who will use you to further their greed driven agenda. If not for you, I would not have had the success that I have in IT, those newsgroup folks were so helpful and taught me so much about servers and IT in general.  I will miss you Internet.
$C: Just curious, is there anything stopping us from taking back NN come 2020 if we ask our next president to get rid of Pai?
$C: So I just called my local congressional representative, Joseph Crowley, but unfortunately he wasn't at the "office," and his secretary (i presume) answered the phone. I left a message with them telling them I will not vote for him if he does not do something about the net neutrality repealing, but i got hammered down by the secretary with them telling me that I was "threatening" him apparently. I dont know what else to do at this point.
$C: Get out there and ensure that your representatives understand that they either kill this or not one of them will survive the next election when the net users (all of us) remember and vote.
$C: dont get discouraged? pfff please. this fight was over before we fought it. the issue is not the fcc.  its not NN.  its our corrupted government.  we have lost so much more than NN today...
$C: Call your members of Congress and demand a Congressional Review Act to get this codified in law and protected from regulatory capture.
$C: Have some inspiring quotes:

“Fight’s not over yet! All we have to do is win this round!”

“Adversity is an opportunity for change...”

“Keep your head up, we can do this!”

And remember, *they only win if you admit defeat*.
$C: Get the names of everyone who voted against net neutrality out there, spread their names around and you cover their names wth as much shit and dirt as you can, get out there and vote against them in the next election, this is not a partisan issue


The only way to wipe the smugness of their corporate interest lined pockets us to get them out of office and disgrace them, and they deserve worse for undermining the wishes of 90% of America
$C: Can we class-actionly sue the FCC?
$C: Just went to T_D and they seem to like the result? They even like to flourish capitalism even more. I JUST WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS 20 years from now lol. 
$C: That's right u/spez, we have not yet even begun to fight.
$C: This just goes to show that no matter how hard you fight against the machine, the house always wins.
$C: Can’t believe that no matter what this country wants we can’t achieve it. 
$C: When you say you'd be supportive of a lawsuit, will that come in the form of lipservice or actual money?

This would actually be a great way to spend the $10M set aside for redditnotes that you never gave back to the community like you said you would
$C: Switch the fight to breaking up the monopolies.  Net neutrality is ripe for abuse by the fed and being ignored by the telecoms.
$C: I'm so saddened by this. I work from home for a video game company and use a lot of bandwidth. My ability to internet is a big reason that I have job security. I fear for all of us remote employees. Whatever needs to be done to get this turned around, count me in. 
$C: Unless you guys start taking control of your country you might as well go to fishing. Democracy does not apply here. Your country has become a corporation and you are the employees. 
$C: And if this is the time to an end and the internet dies, we need to let them know that the North remembers and that Winter is Coming for them.
$C: It wouldn't  be so frustrating  and disappointing  if people knew that protesting does absolutely  nothing and a waste of time.  If you knew the inevitable  outcome it wouldn't  hurt so bad.  Sit back and take solace in knowing that none of what we laymen do works and the big guy will always win.  Complete waste of time trying to fight the inevitable. We may think our voice matters but it falls on deaf ears. Feel free to write your representative but don't feel bad when they do absolutely  nothing.. 
$C: This is only the climax of the war, giving in is not an option.
We WILL win the internet and we will overpower Fajita Pie!!
This is our Battle of Odzak!!
$C: This would be the perfect time for our president to step in, if he even is our president.
$C: I contacted my state senator and he gave me a spiel about how getting rid of this was a good thing.  In other words, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin is completely hopelessly lost.

please spez, lying doesn't look good on you.
$C: Dude we've been doing that shit for like a century and all it's lead to is this.  They ALWAYS ignore the people.  Even f you're my age did you just forget the Bush years?
$C: I called the office of Roy Blunt (one of my reps) and someone answered. I was told this:

What we need is less policy and more laws on the books when it comes to Net Neutrality. Roy Blunt is in favor of a congressional bill that takes the policy of Net Neutrality, and makes it into a binding law with actual binding consequences for companies who violate that law.

Under the policy of NN, the FCC had no legal 'teeth' to combat against those who didn't adhere to it. The only reason it exists is because companies CHOOSE to abide. A law doesn't afford them that choice. They have to comply, not abide.

I said I can understand that argument, but for my support, I'd want to see some drafts of this bill BEFORE the policy went away.

The response: the FCC has a lot more independent autonomy than congress does, and that's part of the problem right now. There are too many 'commissions' that are not subject to the people. They have monumental power and nobody to control them.

Essentially, this wasn't about the internet as much as taking away unchecked power from the FCC.

I was encouraged to keep speaking out and to keep supporting Net Neutrality, and ensure that congress takes up the fight to establish actual binding law to address it.
$C: Ill tell you a huge problem here and I honestly don't know how to differentiate. The FCC continues to tell people that by doing this they will AVOID having big cable companies control the internet by blocking and/or slowing down websites who they perceive as competition, but everyone else is saying the exact opposite. I have to be honest I'm not exactly sure myself at this point. If the FCC and cable companies plan was to mask this as an exact opposite of what's really happening, they did a fantastic job. I have polled several friends about this and probably 90% of them said they were for it because they didn't want to see Cox control content and speed. 
$C: Well shit, now I'm gonna be worried about how this will affect the UK for ages...someone help me please
Edit: professional reply only please... I don't want naysayers making my panic worse 
$C: Fuckin Word Whomp Gopher!
$C: Too little, too late, I know, but I just wrote that fucker Dave Brat a nice message about his actions.  It's surprisingly cathartic.  I am now one of those "single-issue" voters that the media and talking heads like to paint as irrational.  
$C: *The end times are near.*
$C: One day we will all feel nostalgic about how we were able to download games without hitting data cap 
$C: This is like taxation without representation, the very thing that fueled a revolution and angered the 13 colonies so much that they became their own nation. Most people of the United States said we want net neutrality, and then we have no say over what actually happens. I can’t think of any regular person against net neutrality, only people in power. The U.S. formed on the principle that everyone has a say and that majority rules, that no one person has less say than anyone else, yet, look at the ruling and outcry and petitions. I see this as an opportunity to remove political parties from the equation and to rally behind a single banner. Despite our voice, we weren’t listened to at all.
$C: Thanks for fighting! I’ve been calling my Representative and getting everyone I know to contact the FCC. Fuck the GOP
$C: Can we vote next on repealing the FCC? 

...actually I meant that sarcastically but now that I mention it can we dismantle the FCC? they are a government office. Can we not just either remove all responsible parties that voted against the citizens wishes or just tear the whole thing down and make a new office to do a better job?
$C: Hmm. This is scary but sounds exciting! I wonder how different life will be? 
$C: We need to fight the corruption at it's core. r/WolfPAChq

Why should we have to fight this fight again and again?
$C: I'm not giving up until the very end of this fight. As long as there's a war for Net Neutrality we still have a chance remember that.
$C: What does this mean for me, the consumer? Do I have to pay even more money now? 
$C: I'm so tired y'all.
$C: I've been watching [Reddit's Status](https://reddit.statuspage.io/) for a little while.  There's up spikes in errors and a down-spike in request rate starting right at the time of the vote.  It'll be interesting to see if that continues.
$C: I've lost a piece of freedom today. Maybe tomorrow I can also lose my life, for watching Anime.
$C: Does someone have the link to the comment that always shows up of previous telecom abuses before they reclassified? Trying to give proof to a friend that doesn't think this is a big deal.
$C: Can we get like a ESPN type Channel for local government election standings and updates?
$C: No Republicans keeping their seats in 2018

$C: can't believe the vote. OMG. We have to keep fighting. Call our senators and reps. Get them used to us-where they know us by our first name...and keep up the pressure.
$C: Do not browse controversial. I regret it.
$C: Thank you, American population, for dragging the rest of the world into your pile of shit. We're all really grateful that you allowed this to happen. 
$C: Can people outside the US do anything to help?
$C: We need a government agency that exists solely to dismantle government agencies that no longer work for the people. But how long would it even last before it needs to dismantle itself? Probably immediately with the political climate these days. Big money is the only thing people care about, RIP humanity.
$C: When your phone line is more of a utility then your data plan smh
$C: Fucking a guys let’s march
$C: Just shows that no matter what, we don't get a say
$C: Call out businesses and shit. Netflix's twitter posted lamenting about the vote, despite the fact that they did NOTHING this time around to inform their users about what net neutrality is and why it would be a bad thing for them to lose. Don't let businesses reel you in with politics only when it suits them.
$C: Sooooo it did not matter what the American populace wanted because the shills in DC were going to approve it anyway? 
$C: I want to make them feel more pain than we made EA feel. I'm just not sure how we can make them feel it. Having a loud voice in union is extremely important but I feel like making them pee there pants a little is also important. Even if it is just for the lols
$C: NNBros think it's fair that Google and Reddit pay the same price for bandwidth as you and me despite commanding 90% of the ad market, and yet funny how that same lot are in favour of a progressive tax, but not on a progressive pay scale for people who consume massive amounts to bandwidth compared to others (because with NN, Google pays the same rate for bandwidth as your grandma does for playing farmville)
$C: What do these old farts know about the internet?

$C: Will the pop-up that some of us use from battleforthenet change in any way?
$C: For the fuck sake, us citizen, take your democracy back ! Do you really want to wait 3 years ?
$C: How does Disney fit in here? Surely their Fox acquisition isn't just a coincidence? With Net Neutrality gone, could Disney (through their company relations) convince large ISP's to throttle traffic from Netflix and prioritise Hulu?
$C: I hope your efforts are more than just a tiny .gif on the front page, spez.
$C: Why would the FCC be allowed to appoint commissioners with obvious ties to big corporations that have a vested interest in this outcome? Why are obvious conflicts of interest allowed to happen? FCC is so corrupt.
$C: Does anyone have a good summary of the actual rules that are being overturned here for a technical person semi-familiar with the issues involved?
$C: Maybe things are looking up for our local libraries. 
$C: As a Dominican, how can I help?
$C: Isn't Facebook all about bringing the world together through the internet? Don't you think with that thought process they'd be totally against this? Have they ever said anything on their view about it?
$C: Vote Dem. 
 
That's the simplest way to prevent 95% of the bullshit that we're dealing with.

$C: Goodbye Internet ;(  I've had some of my best memories on you <3
$C: You need to pay attention to which Congressmen and senators support net neutrality. Republicans won't do anything about it. This battle was lost November 2016 and can't be fought again until 2018, or perhaps even 2020. Help us find and support candidates that will save net neutrality,  red or blue. 
$C: If I were Ajit Pai I would be so afraid for my self after today. I'm not making any threats personally, I'm just saying he painted the largest target on himself with this event.
$C: So what does this mean for us consumers?
$C: Good thing you shitheels let the Russians and /t/the_donald run free on here for your precious clicks.
$C: If you want NN back, vote D in 2018.

Simple fix.

Both parties are not the same.
$C: Thank you for this. I am using some of this language, and many of these directions, in my own circles to try and spread awareness. Thank you to everyone on here for fighting the good fight. Let's keep at it! 

Also, here is a [link](https://secure.betofortexas.com/page/s/protect-net-neutrality?source=ema171214-nn) to become a citizen co-sponsor of the "Save Net Neutrality Act" (HR 4585).

$C: Net Neutrality

FTFY
$C: Lynch Pai.
$C: Don't ever wonder if the government gives a shit about the people.
$C: told you so
$C: Can I call my internet provider to discuss my feelings on this? What kind of things should I ask?
$C: I can't believe anyone thought it was gonna go any other way. Elect a Democrat or young 30ish Republican or your never getting it back
$C: Real talk. How is this going to effect my PUBG gaming? 
$C: ITT: People who honestly believe it's all one president's fault rather than a tyranny that has been encroaching since the inception of the nation. If you didn't see it coming then you really are just stupid. Government is communistic by it's very nature. It can't not be. You can't be surprised that it's turning out this way given what you started with. 
$C: why are people sounding so nonchalant about this? this is worrisome. the government is pushing for more regulation. apparently people want to be charged more for using something that's supposed to be free. that doesn't sound like a big deal now. but it's a domino effect. it starts with the internet. then it will go on to other things..
$C: Everyone should print pictures of this guy and plaster them everywhere but it's one of those pictures that consists of tiny assholes.
$C: Honest question: before 2015, was this an issue? I mean issue as an actual problem that was disrupting our internet experience.

'Cause I can't recall anything like that.
$C: Is there anything people from Europe can do to help? I can't help but feel the internet is beyond borders and that this would easily affect the rest of the world..

$C: Thanks for the positive message spez, always appreciate your take. This helped me take a second to really think about what's really going to happen. Aka court out the wazoo for months to come.
$C: :(
$C: WE THE PEOPLE ARE FREE TO DO AS WE PLEASE IN THIS CAGE.

Politicians stacking those pockets for the People

$C: That's great, but why does spez still have a job?
$C: If you use a VPN will this still affect you?
$C: I can't believe anyone would support "taking this to court". It would be a completely frivolous suit. There's nothing illegal, unconsitutional, or even immoral about the government freeing the internet from Title II regulations.
$C: How long until Trump tweets this as a victory for the american people?
$C: Nobody is going to stop this as long as your representatives are bought. 
$C: RIP Net Neutrality
$C: I motion for an investigation into the bank accounts of FCC members who voted for the repeal of net neutrality.


I believe these votes were bought and paid for by the beneficiaries of the death of NN.  These companies DO NOT have the peoples' best interests in mind, only the size of their wallets.
$C: I have said it before and I’ll say it again... I love this pic.

$C: For the millionth fucking time, those ruining our society will not stop their machinations until they fear for their own safety.

Until they believe that what they're doing will put them in physical danger, then they have absolutely no reason to stop, nor will they.
$C: Have you considered moving your HQ to Europe?
$C: Big corporation wants government to go after other corporations. Film at 11. 
$C: Sad day, it makes the picture clear. Plutocrat secretly buy the government behind citizens united. They skirt the edges of democracy with gerrymandering. Money that used to pay taxes four government services is now stored tax free offshore. Sex drugs and tax crimes are committed and facilitate to leverage officials. Those officials now work for the Plutocrat who will bring them the end of net neutrality, tax cuts, and steel from the people who they were supposed to serve and represents. I guess it's only merry Christmas for the rich. They turned democracy into its money making slave.
$C: >update2 (9:55AM pst): While the vote has not technically happened, we decided to post after the two dissenting commissioners released their statements. However, the actual vote appears to be delayed for security reasons. We hope everyone is safe.

No you don't. Your favorite defacto subs called for harm to anyone that opposed NN. You know it and we know it. You censor subs you dislike that have different opinions than yours. You edit comments you don't like. Just stop virtue signaling already. 
$C: This is so upsetting and frustrating. Net Neutrality is so important! How can the FCC not see that?! Are they old and out of touch? Or corrupt? Honestly, I can't think of another explanation.
$C: Ya know, you would think TD would be against this repeal?


If AT&T or Verizon or Comcast can block or throttle sites, whose to say they would try to make TD impossible to access?


$C: We should plan to ALL personally go to our local government offices and talk to our representatives. Almost 80% of the U.S. population does NOT support a Net Neutrality Repeal. They need to remember that they work for US. Not a circle jerk ISP monopoly. 

If they want to ignore our calls, emails, and letters. Fine, now they get direct confrontation.
$C: Hey Ajit Pai. Fuck you. 🖕🏼
$C: Ugh. Wished there was a real Frank Castle or Dexter to deal with these fucking people. Seriously disgusted about all these back door deals and shit, its not fair to the people.  
$C: u/Spez wants Net Neutrality because websites like Reddit, that use up a ton of data, could end up paying more. 

Net Neutrality didn't exist until 2015, and all the Apocalyptic things they try to scare people with, weren't happening. Consumers were well-protected then by three powerful federal laws: the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, plus other laws too. They will be well-protected again after today.

$C: Senate and fcc denies the will of the people, everybody gets frustrated. Next step, more frustration! 
$C: Gr Ajit
$C: Hello Democratic Party, I’m one of you now. 
:D
$C: If I sign up for a long term agreement with my ISP, do you think they will find a way to change it before my 3 year contract expires?
$C: People actually thought this wasn't going to happen?
$C: I have an honest question. The whole crux of the argument that Title II is bad seems to be because it puts too much burden on ISPs so they won't invest in infrastructure. What burdens come from Title II? Really, if someone has a point by point breakdown on the rhetoric Pai spews I would really appreciate it. I assume most everything he says is a lie or a distorted truth, but I want the facts that contradict what he says. 
$C: Gauranga

$C: We can't stop fighting now, first time I've ever taken part of this and I'm proud to have done it standing by all of your sides, but we must hold strong, and keep fighting!
$C: I hope Ajit Pai gets ALS.
$C: He still thinks his 'representatives' care XD!!
$C: Can someone explain to me how this benefits the FCC??
$C: wow i'm spechless

$C: Carr said that title 2 does not have any rules against throttling or blocking.  Where can I double this this information?
$C: THE FCC IS EA TREAT THIS AS YOU WOULD EA
$C: This is what you bitcoin billionaires should be using your newfound wealth to fight against.
$C: Maybe change the Constitution so this will never become an issue again.
$C: Substratum is coming guys!
$C: Can anyone help me explain to friends why the internet was not fine in 2015 and why net neutrality was needed? 
$C: Here is something interesting, not sure if anyone mentioned it yet.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/techcrunch.com/2017/12/14/new-york-attorney-general-announces-a-multi-state-lawsuit-challenging-the-net-neutrality-vote/amp/

$C: What would happen to the next Martin Luther King? Would he be online? Would his words get throttled out of existence by mega corporations?
$C: Why is Spez still around?  
$C: Ironically, the best business decision a telecom company could make right now, would be to publicly come out in support of NN and publicly declare that they will not be changing rates even with the repeal. The number of customers they would gain would completely eclipse the amount of money they would make off of charging each of us more to get where we want to go on the internet.
$C: Protesting isn't enough. No matter how much we scream into the skies, we are time after time ignored as a population. We no longer have a voice. But hey, at least we can write letters, right?


Except writing letters isn't enough. Some copy pasted reply from some politician speak toting the party line is all you'll ever get, either to attempt to get complacency or to basically give you a middle finger. So why don't we vote on it?


Except voting isn't enough. Corruption on both ends is an issue, and despite the fact that in this one regard, both sides are willing to "fight" for Net Neutrality, people will still vote along the party lines. Hell, we ALMOST HAD A FUCKING PEDOPHILE who was removed from office TWICE elected to Senate. Yeah, nice voting, America.


Protesting isn't enough, writing letters isn't enough, petitions are ignored, the political spectrum is broken when it comes to voting, and that's without the help of voter suppression, vote fraud, gerrymandering, and all other forms of the reeking corruption that infests our lovely little democracy here.


In the end, it's much more financially beneficial to the offending parties to wait it out until we either have to go back to work or something else drags our attention away. There are no meaningful consequences.


We're not done fighting? We haven't accomplished jack shit. I'd like to see Americans actually start fighting.
$C: Fuck that injun piece of shit
$C: Make the subreddits of anti-NN groups require gold until NN is back.  Fight fire with fire.
$C: That would be good, but don't many Americans basically have access to only one provider? That would then seem kinda unfair
$C: from what i was told, the court of appeal has the final judgement on todays rulling. they turned down the repeal 2 times and this will be the third
$C: Hey man, first off I just want to say thank you for being so active on this issue. I was just wondering a few things that are probably common knowledge, but I live under a rock so we all know how that goes. 

First I'm just wondering, once this whole process goes through and net neutrality is repealed, what kind of time frame do we have before the effects start to take place? And second is more directed at you spez, but what does it mean for Reddit if you guys decide to decline becoming a part of some premium internet package? 

Thank you again for being a saint among men when it comes to this issue.
$C: Why don't you guys just start a revolution already? like damn it's scary what this government is doing to it's people, real glad to not be american rn, and have been for a couple of years now
$C: Where's the word boycott and home it's not coming up more. This is easily winnable

$C: OK I am going to say this

[OH COME ON!!!](https://media.giphy.com/media/MwOuiiTfWfWgM/giphy.gif)
$C: Honestly? I just don't see the point anymore. I don't see how corporations control of the government will ever go away. If it was as simple as a government by the people for the people, then they'd have seen what we overwhelmingly want. 

It's not right. None of this is right. I'm tired of the "us vs them" I'm tired of the racism, and the hate. I'm just tired. And I don't see the point anymore. 
$C: I heard on the BBC news that most of the comments got disregarded due to the fact they seems like they originated from bots. Thousands of identical comments under the same name such as "The Internet", "Net Neutrality", "John Smith" and even the name of famous people who showed any kind of support for Net Neutrality. (Samuel L. Jackson submitted 1.5k times or Mark Rufalo 2k times...etc). Allegedly in the end the "individual non-bot" comments that were against Net Neutrality we on par with those for it.

If we believe in Net Neutrality and intend to fight this, then we shouldn't hide behind fake names.
$C: Mmmmmhhhhh if there would have been something that could have been done before to prevent all this....... MMMMHHHH i can't point my finger on
$C: can someone just list the benefit of the repealing?
$C: It was kind of inevitable. Ajit Pai came from Verizon with the intent on going back in a few years, there was literally no way he was not going to do all he could to repeal Net Neutrality.
$C: Keep fighting America! This isn’t over by a long shot! We don’t go down as easy as Ajit does. 
$C: [Ajit Pai was totally paid off. Why else vote for ending NN away?](https://imgur.com/gallery/bomn7)
$C: I srsly can't believe someone as Pai exists. Sure we all know about corrupt politicians & such, but him? It's like he's not even trying to hide it or act like a good human, he just doesn't give a single fuck about the people. 

I really don't know how you can be so less interested in the interest of the population.
$C: If you have no idea what Title II designation is, you shouldn't have an opinion on Net Neutrality.

$C: Nothing makes me sadder than my rights and civil liberties being stripped away while someone else gets a pay day; nothing makes me angrier than the privilege of apathy that comes from those who said that the repeal of net neutrality would never come to fruition. 

$C: Except for when it comes to your own website.
$C: Fuck u/spez
$C: You don't get to talk about free and open internet you beta male soy boy. With the way you treat the donald.
$C: This is going to be one of those times in history when a single drop leads to a cataclysmic wave of changes. Whether those changes are to the benefit of the people, or to the corporations...that is to be determined. Though, I do hope that my children get to one day read how it was this gross action of greed that began a movement that stripped the corporation's control over our nation's politics. 
$C: What does this mean for countries outside of the US, I live in the UK and I'm not sure whether I should worry or not.
$C: I haven't read all comments, but hasn't it occurred to anyone that the Internet has become a public utility and should be treated (regulated) as such?
$C: Unfortunately telcos have had a great year in power consolidation in spite of everyone's opinions or demands. Representatives in government have represented the ISPs/telcos over individual demands, voting in favor of their bribes over what nearly everyone wants.

Jeff Flake started this destruction in the senate where he pushed through the ISP privacy bill that allows them monopoly power and first rights to users info that they have no choice in excluding. Google/Facebook/Amazon earned your data by giving you a service you wanted, ISPs just default get it first now and you have NO CHOICE in the matter.

Ajit Pai has now handed the keys to the ISPs further in removing title II protections and common carrier status. Net neutrality is now gone.

Underneath all the madness of 2016/2017, telcos/ISPs have been slashing and burning the internet and privacy.  They better hope competition is held back for some time because people will not forget this.

ISPs are not a service friendly to consumers who want fair internet or small/medium business that want fair representation in the markets.
$C: FUCK.
$C: Blatently subverting the people's will to line the pockets of Comcast Nazis. What a time to be alive!
$C: Don't even know what words to use to describe this.
Surely the FCC chairman is looking at some hefty profit in the way of bribes. With all of that opposition, who is their right mind would vote for unless there is an external motive also involved. $_$
People will never stop fighting against this, eventually other people will come in and just strip this out if it ever somehow go into place.


$C: hahahahahahahahahahahahaha *gasp* HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
$C: Vote Trump out to get back net neutrality.
$C: People of Reddit. Can we not protest? 

$C: So I see right and Republicans on Facebook asking, "what's actually different? Isps could throttle you before and they didn't."

Im guess they're being disengenuous. But what's the answer here and the best way to combat misinformation? 
$C: Well for one I don’t even have Comcast. And another thing, if you didn’t know, it’s very common for places in the U.S. to have one or two options in they’re area. Hardly a competitive market if you ask me. I’m pretty fortunate to have a smaller company who offers excellent services right now. Not everyone has that option however. Support the repeal all you want, but don’t speak for the whole country because you live in an area that has as many ISPs as phone manufacturers.
$C: I don't know if it's a good thing or not that this might become the most upvoted post ever...
$C: I'm so sick and tired of hearing uninformed people crying about her neutrality 
$C: Should we cancel our internet services as retribution?
$C: "Incredible activism?" 

See, this is why our country is going to hell. People sit at their computer, fire off an email, make a phone call, upvote some posts, and pat themselves on the back for doing such a great job.

Where the fuck is the actual march on Washington shouting our demands?


Shut the fuck up, Reddit, you did jack shit to actually fight for net neutrality.
$C: thank goodness it got repealed. 
$C: Writing to your government officials will do absolutely no good. I have done so. Pointless. The only solution is to **STOP FUCKING VOTING THESE INCUMBENT ASSHOLES IN TO OFFICE.**
$C: How can you fight for a free and open Internet when the repeal of these rules prevent you,  reddit, from censoring opinions you don't like?? 

What's different now than pre 2015 NN rules. 

These past 2 years have been terrible for the Internet with reddit, fb,  twitter showing their true colors when it comes to protecting our privacy and giving us platforms to talk freely. 
$C: Maybe if voting, calling, writing letters, and posting comments are not expressing the opinion of the general public we should start considering violence as an option. If a certain FCC leaders body was found hanging from the gate of the white house maybe our other "leaders" will start leading as the people ask.
 
Disclaimer: I am in no way recommending any violence against anyone.
$C: “All hail our corporate overlords!” - me 20 years from now, probably.

$C: these goys ✡️ ✡️ ✡️ we need to connect the whole globe in a New World Order, why can’t these crazy populists undrrstand?? i mean regulation is always good for business, right?
$C: I think reddit has not yet learned how to be multipolitical and I think we're going to be part of the throes of that transformation which must take place. Reddit is now going into a diverse multipolitical mode

$C: Maybe it's a good time to explain to your trump supporting uncle, how this will affect him. And if he has any kids, explain it to them as well. They might be more willing to understand than your uncle. 
$C: Adjit just signed his own death warrant. Rip Mr. pi 
$C: Lol. Salt mine. 
$C: don't you have some comments to edit, spez?
$C: What is the reason behind a roll-back? We know the negative impact that it can have. But are there any logical negative effect from NN that would justify it? 
$C: Vote these fuckers out. That's what you can do. Make them tremble before the next election cycle, and actually get out and vote their asses out.

Make them regret this decision.
$C: So, the idea here is to hand control over to ISPs and take some power away from 'silicon valley' giants like Google and Facebook.

Is there anything stopping Google and/or Facebook becoming ISPs? 
$C: We already lost.  It's called data caps! 
$C: [My message to Ajit Pai ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=th4Czv1j3F8) 
$C: Despite most people on both sides of the aisle voting to keep net neutrality. We need anonymous to help out or something. 
$C: While the repeal of net neutrality rules is certainly discouraging, and a disappointing decision from our elected and appointed leadership, the silver lining is that it may speed the development and adoption of a new and more free web.

$C: This is how I feel about net neutrality: https://youtu.be/bnVH-BE9CUo

It's burning 
$C: How can this administration ignore this issue completely. Fucking frustrating.
$C: there's no point anymore. the people don't matter this country is dead.
$C: I seriously think this issue could unite everyone , Conservative Christians, LGBT, every race, every religion, nearly every economic strata... I'd march arm-in-arm with anyone for this.  
$C: Whats the point of all this activism when the FCC just votes to their party? There's nothing that can be done, the FCC should be politically neutral like the CRTC in Canada. 
$C: Yeah, let's give control of the internet to the government.  Great idea spez!  No way that could ever backfire!
$C: Yeah, you are done.
$C: I'm going to download as much internet as possible and save it for later. 
$C: 3 people just decided that 323 million of us as Americans don't need to decide what we have full access to on the Internet. Pretty much the entire American population is against this but once again we have gone completely ignored. Seems to be the theme of 2017 as a whole....

And no it's not just about images, social media, and fun. It's about applying for jobs online, access to news and accurate sources of information, disenfranchised groups connecting with others like them, researching & access to medical assistance, an even field for startups & new content creators, and so much more. In short, this is about our modern way of living and keeping it free and accessible to everyone and the FCC have just voted to kill that freedom. 

This ain’t over though. Not by a long shot. Contact Congress and your representatives, everyone. Support and keep an eye on the upcoming lawsuits and court cases coming ESPECIALLY with the the fact that tons of falsified comments were made to the FCC and NOT INVESTIGATED. None of this stands legally and believe me, it's gonna be a messy fight. But it's one we have to win. 

Are you mad? Believe me, you should be. #NetNeutrality
$C: This happens only in pure capitalism.. so sad and depressing to see where the world is
Heading. It's going to be destroyed one day and hell, that day might come sooner than we all would like..
That we reached the point where there will be a two class system for the internet.. man.. never thought I'd be living in such a world one day..
$C: I need another cup!
$C: Just did a google search for the two repulicans besides Pai that voted for this garbage, lol.

“Brendan Carr” aka spineless greedy sack of flesh is one of the criminals responsible for ending net neutrality. He must be punished Brendan Carr is an American lawyer who currently serves as a member of the Federal Communications Commission. Wikipedia


$C: this must be stopped before it spreads to EU... Can i do anything to help stop this madness? (im from EU but want to help)
$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjo3hj_fmaE&t=6s
THIS is my link that help you fully
$C: My main concern is that many people seem to think that the repeal of net neutrality will have an instant, devastating effect. ISPs aren't dumb: suddenly charging for particular websites is too obvious. They will most likely try to ease people into the eventually super scummy practices.

If net neutrality is entirely repealed, almost nothing will happen at first. The nightmare "Get the social media package for $xx.xx" almost certainly won't happen for quite some time. And all the people who claim that net neutrality is worthless will point at the supporters and say "I told you we had nothing to worry about; it was just needless regulation all along."

Given that net neutrality does appear to be a largely partisan issue, I would predict that ISPs will stay silent on net neutrality after this, not doing anything significant at least until after the 2020 presidential elections, so as to avoid getting democrats making it part of their campaign or to improve the odds of a Trump victory.
$C: u/spez hear me out. You can get other countries to put pressure on America. Scraping net neutrality will  create a commodity out of American internet traffic. If American companies are offered faster services to American traffic plus net neutrality in almost every country with monetizable traffic, American companies get a competitive edge over other countries tech companies. This means that net neutrality is now subjected to be included into trade agreements. 

Since Canada and America are renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, it's not too late to create an awareness campaign to tell Canadians to call their government officials and demand equal competition for our tech companies in NAFTA. 

Other countries could possibly follow suit. 

I've tried very hard to spam the internet with this idea and call lobbying groups and it is picking up steam. Please help.

$C: I'm Canadian. What can I do to help?
$C: The thing that connects us is at stake. The thing on which this site is built upon on. Internet freedom. I live in Europe and i fear that ban on  net neutrality will slowly spread if we don't take action. Maybe not in a few years but what will happen in 10 years ? It is a dark time, we must be strong, we must be united, we shall not let anyone take the thing that connects us from every corner of the world. For a free internet!
$C: Thanks Obama!
$C: Reddit protect, we attack but most importantly we want net neutrality!
$C: Spez, you are just as corrupt as Ajit Pai.
$C: I am legitimately scared now because Britain takes up a lot of American habits so if Net Neutrality being disbanded happens, it will happen over here. And Britain, my own country, is already a pathetic wreck of a place, IMO, so what happens if i, and millions of citizens, lose our safe haven, our chance to escape reality, our way of cooling off from a hard day of work, our entertainment? God knows, but I am praying that the court decision eviscerates the FCC ruling. 

Ajit Pai thinks he can openly ridicule internet users with a video in order to get what he wants, and expects us to bow down if he succeeds knowing he mocked us to get why he wants? Hell NO! Reddit, do what you do best and do what you can to stop that ruling! 
$C: So hand over control to ISPs again, what could possibly go wrong (be repeated)?

It's funny that TD was against the repeal.... Now they are for it. I wonder what they will say if in the end, TD gets banned from reddit due to ISPs blocking reddit because of TD and it causes Reddit to ban TD.



$C: Is there anything as someone not in the United States, that we can do to support you guys?
$C: WE MUST RESIST!
$C: Violence against anyone is **not** the answer, in response to this or any other government action. It’s wrong and additionally plays into the hands of those who already stereotype and smear  the left,
$C: Trump can do a monstrous thing to raise his approval

sign EO to overturn this decision
$C: ELI5: could someone like, say, google refuse to provide access to it for ISPs that dont write net neutrality into their user contracts?
$C: Well, when the pen fails, then next best thing is the sword. Time to start killing politicians.
$C: Happy to do my [part](https://gyazo.com/1deac3aaaf2c685f5efcf5082845c59f)
$C: Seems like the only thing we can do is collectively stop using the internet all together. Maybe then we could send a message, but there is no way in fuck we could get any significant amount of people to get on board with that. 
$C: Can they limit speed or ask you to upgrade in the middle of online gaming? that might be a great rallying call for that section of the USA. Imagine in a ranked match and being told you have to pay more etc
$C: I’m sick and tired of people trying to make this partisan. 
$C: Oprah: Gold going around for everyone!
$C: Fuck the Trump Administration. Honestly.
$C: Thank you reddit
$C: The FCC wont let me be so let me see if they will support the show GLEE!
$C: The people tried to put up a fight and yet it was for nothing. If these big companies that control the internet and what not can make even more money off of us then by golly they're gonna be for it. 
$C: I said who ever repealed net neutrality your mums a hoe.
$C: Did you google deep dream Ajit Pai?
$C: Just a friendly reminder to all the Trump supporters: when you get mad at your internet going much slower, remember that Trump appointed this man (Ajit Pai), who had this goal from the get go.﻿
$C: I have said multiple times sitting around and writing letters and peacefully protesting wouldnt work. People do not understand sometimes violence and bloodshed is actually necessary. There is still time. Pick your tools, train your mind and body, form an army.
$C: I think it's time for the american people to do what they're great at. Which is sueing people. Sue the shit out of this man
$C: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7Anyw3m_RI)
that will help you enough in this case???
federal (White house, House of Representatives, Supreme Court, FCC & more)
state (U.S. Senate, Governors, Treasurers, Attorney General, Controllers & more)
county (Sheriffs, Assessors, District Attorney & more)
and city representatives (Mayors, City Council & more)
$C: Seriously fuck that guy
$C: How can someone who censors subreddits and edits posts at said subreddits speak so much about “neutrality”?
$C: > THE HILL.
THE QUESTION I HAD WAS I WAS 
HOPING COULD YOU WALK US THROUGH 
HOW THE NET NEUTRALITY ORDERS 
WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR SMALLER 
COMPANIES TO ENTER COMPETITION 
AND ABSTRACT ARGUMENT OF THAT 
MAKE SENSE, BUT EXTENSIVELY WE 
WOULD HAVE HAD BETTER 
COMPETITION PRIOR TO 2015, BUT 
THE BROADBAND LANDSCAPE WAS 
DOMINATED BY THE PLAYERS.

>CHAIRMAN PAI:  PRIOR TO 2015 
WHAT WE WERE SEEING IS -- LET ME 
ANSWER THE QUESTION THIS WAY, SO 
GOING FORWARD, THE LIGHT TOUCH 
APPROACH WE THINK IS THE ONE 
BEST CALIBRATED TO PRESERVE THE 
FREEDOM OF THE INTERNET AND GIVE 
SMALLER COMPANIES MUCH STRONGER 
INCENTIVE TO INVEST IN 
INFRASTRUCTURE.
WHY IS THAT?
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN I WILL 
DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO THE 
STATEMENT LAST THURSDAY WHEN I 
SPOKE TO SMALL PROVIDERS.
ONE PROVIDER IS CALLED SCHONBERG 
IN MINNESOTA AND EXPRESSLY SAID 
HE HAD A BANK INCREASE HIS 
INTEREST RATE, THE RATE AT WHICH 
YOU CAN GET CAPITAL SPECIFICALLY 
BECAUSE OF THE REGULATORY 
UNCERTAINTY CREATED BY THESE 
RULES.
ANOTHER PROVIDER SAID THESE 
RULES REQUIRED HIM TO HIRE A 
LAWYER AND FIGURE OUT HOW THESE 
REGULATIONS WOULD APPLY TO HIS 
BUSINESS.
A NUMBER OF OTHER COMPANIES WITH 
SIMILAR STORIES.
THESE COMPANIES ARE LEAST ABLE 
TO WITHSTAND REGULATORY 
COMPLIANCE BURDENS WE PLACED ON 
THEM.
SO IF YOU WANT MORE COMPETITION, 
WHICH ALL OF US DO, IF YOU WANT 
SMALLER PROVIDERS TO BE AN 
ALTERNATIVE WHICH ALL OF US DO, 
IT BECOMES INCUMBENT UPON THE 
AGENCY TO HAVE A LIGHT TOUCH 
FRAMEWORK THAT GIVES HIM A 
BUSINESS CASE FOR DEPLOYMENT.
SOME SMALLER COMPANIES ARE 
DEPLOYING AND RURAL AREAS, LOW 
INCOME URBAN AREAS WHERE 
BUSINESS CASE IS ALREADY 
DIFFICULT AND THE MORE HEAVILY 
YOU REGULATE SOMETHING IN THAT 
ENVIRONMENT THE LESS LIKELY YOU 
ARE GOING TO GET AND THAT'S 
EXACTLY THE APPROACH WE TAKE 
WITH RESPECT TO BROADBAND.


He literally doesn't answer the question as to why a lot of people getting from major providers had shitty services prior to these restrictions. But you know "muh small bisnis".

$C: "Security reasons" 

Yeah, when people want to literally kill you for making the questionable decisions no one with any sense wants, thats a pretty good indicator its a bad idea. Personally, i wish whatever would be assassin good luck. They all deserve death 
$C: People from India taking our jobs and internet 
$C: Well, I just switched to T-Mobile from Verizon..
$C: Americans vote system is so bloody fucked up no wonder they can do that
$C: So, I think there are folks on all sides of the issue.  As a consumer, however, I think we all can appreciate Net Neutrality, at least in what it promotes.  Whether we would just like ISPs to play by these rules or we prefer regulation, it looks like things are set to change.

Why not have some Consumer Net Neutrality Council that assigns objective grades for ISPs?  This would encourage the ISPs to abide by the principles.  The council could also raise funds to establish alternative competitors in markets that are dominated by a misbehaving ISP.

Thoughts?
$C: Don't like the repeal? Here's the next [step](https://substratum.net)
$C: Net neutrality, is dead. We have lost this battle.

But the war is only beginning...
$C: A bit of an outsider here as I come from the UK but I can see this as a sad day for Americans. Was keeping my fingers crossed that something might stop them :( 

As many have said the fight isn't over so I wish you all luck.

As for Pai? You are a complete bellend and that's all I have to say on that matter.
$C: We're the posts suppressed yesterday??

I thought we'd see more on protests, has u/Reddit looked into this??

Add: u/spez
$C: This headline sounds just like "Here's how Bernie can still win" and is just as false. 
$C: I'm from Europe, but if my boys from USA are getting fucked by corrupt government, then hold my beer and fetch me my coat, as I'm not going to just stare at it

The whole world stands by your side Americans. That piece of shit Pai doesn't have any right to have your internet freedom
$C: government regulation that cannot compellingly justify itself should not exist.
$C: Go fuck yourself ajit pai
$C: Net Neutrality has not even existed for 3 years in the US. Also the plans regarding what they do now have also been mockingly ambiguous. So to say this is good or bad is uncertain. And if you have strong disdain for Trump I can easily see why you'd first see bad things. Personally I'll probably be more shocked if something good happens but I won't just deny that nothing bad will happen either. Just saying if you want things fixed properly vote with your money. It speaks thousands more than a vote at your local ballot box especially when concerning companies not our govt. Ironic I bet everyone here will be seeing Star Wars which is owned by Disney which also owns half the TV channels which also are the reason TV subscriptions are insanely high. But you know this is clearly the end all be all.
$C: Well the best case scenario is ISPs let it all normal like Net Neutrality but you can pay extra for faster speeds on different sites but your ISPs won't throttle or slow down any sites. 
But let's be real ISPs are money hungry idiots. So they'll probably throttle and block sites and make you pay monthly packages to access sites. 
$C: Thanks for your help. Just can't believe it still went through. What a dark time for our government agencies. Keep up the good fight my friends. 
$C:  I'm not a violent person, but since last November.., at least.., I've never wanted to punch someone in the face, as much as Ajit Prick.., sorry,  Pai.
$C: Is it possible for future administrations to overturn this again?
$C: The internet has more power than they realize. Don't give up now!
$C: Maybe it's time to create a new internet.. with blackjack and hookers... 

$C: We will rise. 
$C: These are some weird times we are experiencing. 
$C: rioting starts now.
$C: What good is it for an ISP to not be able to block access to content when sites like Reddit, Google, Twitter etc are able to block content? We never had Net Neutrality. 
$C: My internet is literally crashing what do I do? 2015 laws removed, how will we cope??
$C: I can Imagine some dude crazy enough to go in and start shooting these people for their decision. 1 step closer to communism 
$C: How can I convince my parents that repealing net neutrality is a bad thing? Sounds petty, but it's getting REALLY exhausting hearing how this is going to be for the better of our world.
$C: Go kill yourselves. 
$C: I'm in Canada. I wish there was more I could do to help you guys! This affects us over here too - however indirectly. 
$C: Grandpa Munster Al Lewis was way ahead of his time regarding the FCC... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjTy8cKrwRQ
$C: What can non-Americans do to help the cause? I'm very passionate about Net Neutrality and want to do as much as I can.
$C: Vote Democrat, across the board.
$C: Goodness...I'm trying to tell my mom about this and she thinks it's a fake hoax. 
$C: This is it I hope we can save net neutrality 
$C: You didn't seem so concerned about equality when you censored the_donald.  Better for you to burn with us.
$C: Reddit already censors and takes money to spam certain ideas or content to the front.

The hypocrisy is mind numbing.
$C: Screw this, I'm going to Mars!
$C: The Reddit spam was so fucking annoying about net neutrality I was basically siding with Comcast at this point.... think about that, you drove someone to side with that piece of shit company over you, well done. 
$C: Honestly this is Reddit’s fault as well as 4chan and everything that helped trump become president. You think this would have happened if Hillary had won? 
$C: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
$C: Avenge Net Neutrality like the Avengers
$C: I said they would vote this way.
$C: politicians are such traitors. they made this decision because they were given money for it. 
$C: [people right now](https://youtu.be/zia-cfRq8MQ) 
$C: [This comment has been removed by Verizon]
$C: June, 2018.

*van door opens*

"Psst. Hey kid. Want some 4Chan? How about some Reddit?"

*kid walks faster*

"Come on, kiddo. We have Infowars and Jezebel. Whaddya say?"

*price of black market memes continue to rise*

$C: Everyone is pretty convinced that Republicans are anti-NN because they're either misinformed, bribed, or are driven by their agenda, so i have a question.

How many of you honestly believe that the Democrats are pro-NN because of some good kinded heart the posses? Do you honestly believe that they arent as misinformed as the Republicans and trying to push their own agenda? How many Republicans believe that NN means government internet censorship and are anti-NN, now how many Democrats believe the same thing and thats why they're pro-NN?

edit: Everyone on Reddit was obviously upset with the fradulant anti-NN comments yet perfectly fine with the obvious vote manipulation of the pro-NN promotion posts in almost every single subreddit, gaining un-natural amounts of vote counts but i guess thats okay when its for something Reddit likes.


$C: So it went through? Or can somebody explain it shortly to me what exactly happened? Are there any consequences got Europeans? 
$C: Because of monopolies and our need for internet we can't totally boycott these companies.  But we sure as hell can boycott Verizon for sneaking in a sleeper cell.  Ill be canceling their service today. 
$C: Next step: Replace people in power and reinstate.
$C: Maybe if you had not censored T_D things might be different, but you and your ilk's censoring of political ideas must stop now.  Enjoy the next 7 years.
$C: Good luck Mericans
$C: I'll be in DC tomorrow at 12:00 to protest outside the FCC.
$C: First my country loses so much freedom in carying guns, yesterday a petition against it gets denied and now you lose (the first part of battle about) net neutrality... I'm starting to worry about our freedom and what might come next... My hopes and prayers are with you guys! We all must stay strong and fught for our freedom

Best of luck to all of you fighting for net neutrality!
$C: I have a question. Wasn't net neutrality dead before 2015 as well? Or did they do something different with this repeal? 
$C: I'm not surprised that a group of politicians who back someone that likes to fuck kids wants to fuck the entire world.
$C: Net Neutrality March. Bigger then the Womans march. Lets get millions on the street!! 
$C: What fight? There was no fight. In America only a handful of old rich people get to decide the future of this country

$C: Should I stop building my online business now? I need to know ASAP.
$C: Ajit Pai doesn't deserve to feel safe another day in his life. Where does he live? 
$C: I hope they will ban Reddit.
$C: He has justed started a war, a war where he will lose.
$C: Spez, I fucking hate you. 
$C: Tell the Senators to FIRE AJIT PAI at  http://chn.ge/2kshx46   via @Change #FirePai #FireAjit #FCC #NetNeutrality #SaveTheInternet
$C: I cancelled my cable from comcast, I have to keep my internet because they are the only provider in the area basically but I cancelled what I could in protest.  I reduced my bill by over $100 which was a bonus.  I encourage others to do the same. 
$C: How many actual people on Reddit are US citizens over 18.
$C: So from the information I’ve gathered net neutrality is internet providers like AT&T and Verizon charge you extra For what you search correct? 
$C: I got a temp ban on Twitter for calling those 3 assholes just that lol. 
$C: What happens next? 
$C: fuck the fcc
$C: What ramifications if any does Reddit expect to see as a result of this change?
$C: > What comes next? We don't know.

What comes next is they continue slowfucking us, regardless of whether we want it or not.

Write any letter you want, call your representatives, start a petition, continue the public outcry. That's all beautiful and noble, but as you can plainly see it means nothing. Your voice means nothing. You have no power in this world. Your "vote" is a mechanism to maintain the illusion of choice and keep you pumping out those tax dollars.

The last bastion of freedom for humanity existed on the Internet. Now it has finally been taken away, and they will milk your wallet dry for Internet privileges. They will block content that goes against their agenda, and continue slowfucking you like they have for years and years. 

And it will only get worse.
$C: Trump voters the blame for this rests squarely on you
$C: I have a hard time following this Net Neutrality thing, I don't know why. It's confusing. But, for me, it comes down to this: if governments are not serving the people they represent, they need to be blown the fuck up.

So, if that bomb threat was in favor of freedom for the people, THANK YOU to whomever did it. 


$C: There's only one thing you can do. Completely block reddit in red states. They voted against net neutrality, they get what they asked for. All other measures (like the lame reddit logo) are pointless.
$C: Any millionaire redditors out there that feel like buying the politicians just like the corporations do? 
$C: I say we should have a major boycott and protest over the internet and in our cities
$C: As a Canadian what can I do?
$C: Is there anything us Europeans can do to help battle for NN in the USA? I don't mind sending Ajit a pack of used dirty condoms via drones.
$C: I heard that there is some assassination plots on Ajit Pie. Any idea if it’s true?

Edit: friend of mine claimed that 4chan is planning the assassination plots
$C: Yeah it sucks, but there will be a decentralized internet within the next 3 years via [Blockstack](https://blockstack.org/). 
$C: But this is going to spur innovation on the Internet because nothing ever happens there.....give me a break, it’s like legalizing prostitution to to spur on fucking in whorehouses. 
$C: I bet my left nut that Ajit will pay the Congressmen
$C: This makes me want to riot.  I'm just furious inside.  I feel bad for everyone involved and I hope and pray that this gets dealt with properly.   This is one the worst things to happen since I've been alive personally.    It has a more direct effect on me than 911 did.  Years from now people will compare this to the Kennedy assassination and say "where were you when our government sold us out?"
$C: Its just going to be slower. Like 3g 4g and not lte. Were fine. Anyway it has to go through congress and 81% of congress supports net neutrality so we have a chance of keeping it 
$C: I'm not fighting for freedom of the internet with someone that doesn't even allow that. I'm looking at the hypocritical Reddit admins
$C: Well, keep voting Republican and this will keep happening.

Their own policies prove that Republicans hate Americans.
$C: The FCC are bought and paid for so what could we expect. Still very sad though.
$C: We should go to comcast stores and protest about net neutrality
$C: We need to keep these posts on the front page till the end! We must keep fighting, we can do this Reddit!
$C: Whomest the fuck eat ass
$C: Fuck the fucking fuckers! Slimy cunts! 
$C: I'm Canadian. How can I help?
$C: They are not taking away my life. I'll keep fighting until this is over.
$C: fuck trump. This is his fault. Fuck him and anyone and any thing that stands with him.
$C: Yes, you are. 

Writing angry screeds on the internet and being a keyboard jockey is easy. Actually *doing* something about it is hard, and if people had done *more*, then you wouldn't be in this predicament. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: I hope this puts reddit out of business.
$C: If Comcast makes reddit pay money, and you don’t, please do Reddit a favor and make T_D be throttled before any other page.

Thank you.

$C: /u/arabscarab (cc /u/spez /u/kn0thing) - How do Reddit's parent and affiliated companies view net neutrality? Has Conde Nast or Advance Publications lobbied, released statements, etc on the issue? 
$C: Hahahahahaha ameritards lmaooooo
$C: Being Canadian I don't have to worry about the net neutrality (yet) but I do hope you all can pass through and keep the net neutrality cuz that is just bullshit
$C: It’s over give it up
$C: And 10 years from now everything will be about the same. 
$C: Block every visitor from .gov domains asking they pay you $5/mo to use reddit.

Problem solved.
$C: Does anyone know where pai lives? 
$C: May Ajit Pai die an embarrassing death. Not a painful one, nor a lonely one, but one so ridiculous that it keeps anyone who hears about it from taking his life story seriously.
$C: People said Trump wasn't a sure thing either, we're fucked, plain and simple. There's no reason at all to abolish neutrality except they want more money. It's over.
$C: So they got rid of Title II for wireline networks. New goal: restore Title II for wireline networks *and add it for mobile networks*.
$C: I see this as a great opportunity for republicans to lose seats in the midterm elections. Almost everyone, regardless of party, wanted net neutrality to stay. Yet republicans voted it out. They might as well have handed in their resignations while they were at it. *Nobody* is going to forget what you did today. 

See you in 2018. 
$C: !RemindMe 1 year
$C: If I learned anything from this ordeal is not to care and give up because emailing did nothing calling did nothing. So whats the god damn point? 
$C: What is certain is that we are.going to have to start paying the isp to use reddit if we get to loud...sad face 
$C: The fight is over. Nothing short of destroying  the corporations  that run the US will stop any of what is coming. Net Neutrality was only the first step for big business to oppress the people. 
$C: The picture was well worth clicking on this post all by itself...
$C: Spead the word guys! I don't want to pay for my porn! 
$C: Well said spetz, very good everyone thinks you're a hero again. Keep up the good work with selling our data and editing user comments.

P.s. please get rid of horrible roddit app banner
$C: Are we not being punished enough having Trump as President
$C: Community fiber. These two words send chills down the spine of your ISP because it challenges their infrastructure enabled monopoly. Start one in your community today in protest, get faster internet as a side effect. https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/hate-your-isp-maybe-you-need-community-fiber
$C: Can someone hack this mother fucking shitbag ( I know it would just fuel their position, but I would love to see this mother fucker homeless, dirty begging for lose change.)? Yes we need to vote, hell yes we need to stand up and rise up against individuals that abuse positions of power, and profit from it!  

Some say we can scream, write, call our state reps letting them know how we feel on this subject.  But will that matter much? Money is the real handshake some of our Reps. While we suffer as individuals, watching what it is like, feeling what it is like, to lose something most of us have had the freedom of using for decades now.

We cannot lose all hope, we have to come together as a whole, and fight.  Fight for NN, fight for freedom, fight for the future.  This is just a beginning of a chapter that we will watch unfold.  

What matters is, what will you do to help fight this ignorance and injustice?  

-The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil, is for good men to do nothing     -Edmund Burke
$C: Is this affecting only America? I keep seeing comments to contact your house Senate or is this a world wide issue in that if it gets passed in the usa it will go worldwide 
$C: So? You're not going to do anything about it? Just give us a little pat on the back and a fucking news update, that's fucking all?! At least do some shit, like a complete blackout of the site. You say you are going to keep fighting, but you haven't even thrown a single fucking punch. Go to hell!

$C: The fights been over since they announced theyd repeal it lol wtf are you talking about
$C: Fight the power!
$C: Oh nooo the internet is going back to how it was before 2014, Damnit! now I have to order my Reddit and Gay Porn packages just like before!!
$C: maybe you should just edit the vote spez :)
$C: Its over
$C: lol
$C: It's time for you Americans to really riot. I mean, check out how we do in Europe.
$C: Omg im in Philippines but i still care about america because Philippines is such a copier and might copy what america did and now im soooo scared
$C: I would like to read more comments on the impacts that will be both beneficial and consequential to this decision. I have a couple in mind.

It occurs to me that in one way, this may result in the continued use of lobbyists. We definitely still require representation in this form because 90% of Americans are still farmers and cannot afford not to tend their crops because they have to travel to Washington for their voices to be heard.

Another benefit is that we can rest assured that the money ~~earned~~ ~~stolen~~ ~~borrowed~~ ***surrendered*** to these companies, will be ~~***pocketed***~~ ^^^used to ~~create~~ ***Suggest*** the idea of "New and Improved ^^^tm" infrastructure that provides better internet surfing pleasure.

Jokes aside, is there some benefits to this that can help consumers? Because I have never seen anything to support this idea. and that bothers me.
$C: From the UK, good luck my American friends you’re not just fighting for the US you’re fighting for the UK as well. Don’t give up!
$C: To be honest, all this "promotion of competition" was argued during the deregulation of the financial market in the 80s, which had ultimately lead to financial crisis after financial crisis. These were also made by Republicans that tried to "promote competition" with loans and mortgages and futures, eventually enabling the financial institutions to actually play and gamble with money.

$C: We have to get this more upvotes than EA got downvotes!
$C: Wasn't there a law passed where you can buy someone's internet history? If so could we set up a go fund me for Pia's internet history, and use the system against him?
$C: How am I reading this if there's no net neutrality? Don't you think all the ISP's would be prepared with plans to get all our money the second it was revoked?
$C: So was this just blatant corruption?
$C: Hahahahahaha, good riddance.
$C: A couple of good quotes from the 2 that voted against repealing:

>"I dissent from this fiercely spun, legally lightweight, consumer-harming, corporate-enabling Destroying Internet Freedom Order,” said Commissioner Clyburn. “There is a basic fallacy underlying the majority’s actions and rhetoric today: the assumption of what is best for broadband providers is best for America. What saddens me is that the agency that is supposed to protect you is abandoning you. But what I am pleased to be able to say is the fight to save net neutrality does not end today. This agency does not have the final word. Thank goodness."

`

>“I dissent from this rash decision to roll back net neutrality rules,” said Commissioner Rosenworcel. “I dissent from the corrupt process that has brought us to this point. And I dissent from the contempt this agency has shown our citizens in pursuing this path today. This decision puts the Federal Communications Commission on the wrong side of history, the wrong side of the law, and the wrong side of the American public.”
$C: Too bad it wasn't a big enough deal to black out reddit for.
$C: So why isn’t there a business appeal? If you’ve decided your government is not to be trusted, is anyone taking it to the board room? Someone out there with the competency to make a NetNeutrality  mutual fund to serve on the AT&T board? Is there a fourth provider that needs to come into business? Maybe it’s time to let the government have the old ARPAnet and a new Co-op private net is built out without the need for the FCC as the klinkernet is still there though heavily throttled back. It may take more time and effort than 5 seconds to fill in an electronic petition. Or is all the energy I observe here actually a sad admission the RL workers are few?
$C: Hyped up overreactions. The chances of this “repeal” actually impacting you are less than you dying in a car accident before years end. 

The problem isn’t NN, the problem is the lack of competition and providers taking claim of areas in cities. Where one carrier makes their claim, another will not encroach. 
$C: So I don't understand why the FCC wants to kill net neutrality. What is their argument why they want to do it? 

(I live in Sweden and have not been involved in the whole debate) 
$C: Hire a shooter 
$C: Is there an actionable call to action we can do. Or is the only option for us to spread awareness?
$C: Hope this isn't it...
$C: Rip Net Neutrality❤
$C: Does this affect only the American states or will it cross over to other countries as well?
$C: Bruh, they don’t give a flying fuck.
$C: This doesn't mean you give up. If we stop, they win. You live under control of a republican who thinks he can control what you pay. This nation is a fucking free nation, so lets MAKE THAT HAPPEN!
$C: eat shit
$C: Haha I came to Reddit for the salt and I wasn't disappointed! They made an announcement crying! Haha
$C: Are we really surprised? These fucks are criminals they just want more power. Fuck the corporations that do this and people like Pai. Total disgrace. It's nice to see how many people are behind this though. It shows the corruption if there's this much support and it still got repealed. 
$C: I need to know what I can do to support the fight for Net Neutrality if I'm not in the US. Any tips?
$C: I would take this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude to the *volk* at r/The_Donald for putting the American internet in this position. 

Everybody give them a round of applause.  Their loyalty to their Glorious Leader will surely be rewarded with priority internet traffic in the TrumpNet to come.
$C: Democracy means nothing now. We can speak all we want; no one's going to fucking listen. This is the most subtle form of censorship I've ever witnessed; when the people in charge just don't fucking hear what we're saying. The power no longer belongs to the citizens; in fact anything we DO, matters jack SHIT to the spying, rich, corrupted, smug, biased, xenophobic, tone-fucking-deaf higher-ups sitting high as a kite in their high spot and drinking shit out of a huge fucking Reese's cup.

The only hope lies in Congress, which is not some stupid horsefucking deaf bitchcorp, unlike the FCC, led by a man filled with more lies than a fucking bed, and who has no fucking idea what he's talking about.

I'm not putting my hopes in that Congress will prevent, hell, even CHALLENGE the damn repeal. Net neutrality dies, no more, and no less. This is the END of the Internet we stood for, as citizens of a democracy that ~~listens to its people~~ doesn't give sixteen flying fucks about anything we say.

Goodbye, democracy. Goodbye, a pure government. Goodbye, the USA that ONCE stood for freedom, prosperity, and the pursuit of happiness. All of this can go to diarrhea SHIT if this is the current pattern and trend of what is to come. Fuck everyone who chose this, fuck everyone who voted for this, fuck YOU, Ashit Pie, and fuck everyone who thinks Republicans can have any say in the government without them saying any lies and possessing no corruption in their words. America representing freedom? BULL. SHIT. Say goodbye to everything you've stood for, you gullible, naive, dumb-as-fuck citizens of a "democracy". Rant OVER.

#BREAKING: My office has now identified 2 million fake comments on #netneutrality  that were submitted to the @FCC using the stolen identities of Americans across the country. 

The FCC must delay its vote until we get to the bottom of this massive fraud: on.ny.gov/2AU2esU
$C: In 2017 i am just baffled how the supposedly biggest democracy on earth handles their business.
It’s not the first time this happened, but again a presidential candidate that did not win the popular vote (which would be democratic in its definition)  became president.

After that US proceeds to struggle against some corpus who wants to plunder everyone’s freedom and pockets. And it seems no one is able to stop them...
All in all i think one should distance themselves from the notion that the USA (not the people but the structure) might a the role model.

It is sad to see a country crumble under its weight of corruption and wrongly projected conservatism (i am not saying that conservatism is bad at all, but the blocking of progress right now is due to it)...
$C: Remember everyone... Citizen's United is STILL at the core of what's really wrong with our government.

Get big corporate lobbying out of politics and we can have Democracy back. Until then we are a capitalist oligarchy no matter which side is in power.
$C: I'm going to go outside and scream at the sky. Who's with me?????
$C: Is there way we can organize a boycott of one single app for just a day to prove that they don't know what they're about to do? And we are a force to be reckoned with?
 #savetheinternet 
$C: We did it reddit!!!
$C: The worlds going to look back in 100 years and wonder why 99% of the population stood back while 1% took advantage of them. 

Greed will win until 99% of the people get greedy too.  
$C: /u/spez, mad?
$C: Every post you do in reddit will now cost .50.
$C: I don’t understand how activism speaks louder than the money of those in power :(

$C: If he was a verizon lawyer, then isn't this conflict of interest?
Furthermore, conflict of interest in lawyers can result in being debarred, which means he can never work as a lawyer ever again.
$C: Honestly, and I say this with as much strength as I can to hold back, but this was never a discussion. They were giving us the information about what was going to happen. But it wasn't a "Is this ok?" The damn 2 million fake comments supporting it, being reveled, and still not postponing it is more than enough to prove that. Hell, with how it worked it was probably them making the fake comments. 

Let the constituents vote on their congressmans' salary and watch how much they change to care about us. Because they honestly don't. Why would they? They don't deal with the issues we do... they make nearly 180k a year not counting their bribes...

But alas, if it's not rejected again they will be in trouble. Don't stop fighting, if we make their lives hell they might start to care. 

Or you know, a stress package for congressman with a nice bonus at the end of each year xd.
$C: Today's "vote" on repealing NN is more proof that it is lobbyists' money that make our laws, and not concern over our citizens. 

This should be definitive proof that Americans have next to no input in the running of our country. 

Good luck people. We are all gonna need it.
$C: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!
$C: Ajit Pai and the two others that voted against #NetNeutrality are enemies of the American people.

I don't know who's worse these "people" or natural disasters. You don't see hurricanes fucking people over for a God damn percentage.
$C: ^^something ^^something ^^right ^^to ^^abolish ^^government


^^^^^^LowQualityBait.jpg
$C: Sorry
(From a canadian)
$C: I've heard something is apparently happening in Canada as well. A big corporate group backed by numerous companies like Bell Alliant? This doesn't feel like the end of Net Neutrality. This feels like the end of the internet world.
$C: F@*k you Ajit Pai. Disgrace to humanity. I won't have learned so many thing if I had to pay extra for it.
$C: We're paying close attention to this in Canada and I personally am making sure my social networks are aware of this fight. Because in the end it affects us all and it will have repercussions around the world. Hang in there citizens of America, keep fighting! 
$C: This is no longer a fight that can be won behind keyboards. You need to organise protest marches in every city. Let them know just how many people support it and what they will lose I they go against it.
$C: Let's make our own internet, and the ISP's and government aren't invited.

$C: Theres no way they will get rid of net neutrality, its ridicoulus to have to even have to argue it, none the less i will give you my ki to create an anti ajit pai spirit bomb
$C: how about also stop giving assholes that help allow this sort of thing a fucking platform? ya know, shitholes like t_d?
$C: Now that it's repealed, everyone is going to start bitching about their internet service for being shit without realizing it was shit before NN, during NN and still after. I had data caps before and I had data caps after. I had shit customer service before and after. I had ridiculous prices before and after.

Maybe now that more fire has been lit, people will spend some time to figure out the problem. No one talks about it, Tom Wheeler doesn't talk about it even though he knows he should. Ajit and those fuckers know but won't talk about it. ISPs certainly wouldn't talk about it.

The problem is government sanctioned monopolies. This is done via "right-of-ways" over the "public" poles and underground conduits. These government sanctioned right-of-ways are so strong FUCKING GOOGLE CAN'T AFFORD TO ENTER THE MARKET. Get your heads out of your asses and light the internet on fire over this.
$C: Reddit is the front page of the internet. And at the very least im not going to be one to give up this front. Hope all of the American Public realises just how important net neutrality is nowadays 
$C: The idiots who modified user posts, ban subs they don't agree with, etc are talking about a free and open internet. What a joke u/spez
$C: I like to think that all those senators that got bribed will suddenly vote against getting rid of Net Neutrality and keep the money at the same time.
$C: well, we had a good run
$C: Having access to the internet already costs me a large portion of my monthly income. Home internet itself for me is $95 a month just to access things that I have to pay for; Netflix, Hulu, XBOX Live etc. Then there’s my family’s mobile devices which costs around $270 a month. Both services are consistently up and down in terms of speed and reliability. Not only that but everything is littered with ads. You can’t even make it through a video on YouTube without ads popping up half way unless of course you pay even more money. I understand that this is a first world problem and these things are nothing but leisure so I don’t feel affected either way. There are a lot of people who could greatly benefit from a break away of social media. 
$C: https://ajitpaisucks.net/
$C: We need to have a united voice! Sing so loud that not even Washington can ignore our voices. 
$C: Exactly we are not losing  the free and open internet must be preserved.
$C: The real fight begins now

Because yes, internet neutrality is the Dark Souls of politics.
$C: Fuck the FCC
$C: dat me
$C: I think that too many people will be affected and instantly it will get reinstated. Too many americans use the internet all the time.
$C: I just wanna know who gave spez gold lol
$C: “Organic takeovers”

You lying little cunt.
$C: Haha sheeple LOSERS!!!! Net Neutrality will never stay! 
$C: I woke up to the Disney/Fox deal and now the FCC repeal. This is a really depressing day. 
$C: Quick heres how bernie can still win!
$C: Is there a way to create your own off the grid ISP? Like creating a dish that piggybacks off of another ISPs satellite or something? I would gladly do that and give unthrottled internet to community as much as I could. 
$C: Not frustrating because we knew it was going to happen. If you are just now frustrated you were ignoring everything for the past few months.
$C: Any way I can help over here in Canada?
$C: Definitely a disappointing outcome, although I completely agree the fight is not over & there is still hope. I live in PA & emailed my concerns about the demise of net neutrality to both of our senators. Senator Bob Casey was in favor of keeping net neutrality while Senator Pat Toomey was in favor of repealing it.

So the way I'm looking at it is to keep beating the ear drums of anybody in govt. who will listen & support net neutrality. There are still those in power that support it & are not happy with the FCC's ruling, meaning there is still a shot it could be kept from being repealed. That is as long we the people continue to make our dissatisfaction of the repeal of net neutrality loud & clear. 

If we want to keep enjoying the internet as we know it everybody needs to act now before it's too late. Even something as simple as a few emails to your local, state, or federal representatives helps the cause in the long run. Basically if we become a bigger thorn in the government's side than the FCC is right now about this issue I believe we can keep this planned repeal from happening.
$C: I’m so drunk right now 
$C: It taking you so long to respond in your first post seems like you knew nothing about what net neutrality was and why it's only been around since 2015.
$C: I don't get why everyone is suddenly in favor of the Trump administration being in control of the internet. Loosening the FCCs control means loosening the control any administration on either side  has on it. This is a GOOD thing.
$C: /u/spez /u/kn0thing /u/arabscarab
how much to pay for reddit to sue
$C: why are people so pissed off about net neutrality, when we should be focusing on the real problem

ezreals q bug still isnt fixed
$C: I think it's important to tell people the history of this issue, in 2007 Comcast decided to block torrents.  The FCC was powerless to make them change.  Until 2015.  Now, they wil be free to block whatever services they feel like.

When people say things like "now you'll have to pay more to access facebook" it sounds like fear-mongering and turns people away (myself included).  I feel like it's important to educate people that Net Neutrality was in response to these providers actually limiting access to a large portion of the internet for many subscribers.
$C: Big brother always wins
$C: Just be wary of 'heroes' in congress.  We want the bills to restore Net Neutrality, not to be a further gift to ISPs.
$C: Im not gonna pay for extra stuff, might as well not even pay for Internet at home. Might as well cancel the service then...smh
$C: the fist kinda looks commie lol
$C: Can us Europeans do something to help you guys?
$C: In my high school alone there were dozens of students voicing there opinions and explaining the situation to everyone.  The FCC has not heard the last of the American people and especially not reddit as a whole. We will continue to fight for net neutrality and not go down without a fight!!!!
$C: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
$C: Heading out to protest tomorrow.

Luke dies. Leia doesn't die. Yoda returns. Snoke dies.
$C: Completely off topic here, but why are people giving his post and comments gold? He's the CEO of reddit lol
$C: Obsidian (odn) and stratum  project for the win! Huge gainers short term with this news. 
$C: Reddit is an echo chamber that does not tolerate dissenting opinions. Net neutrality should be done away with.
$C: If we hate Pai so much, why are we fighting so hard to keep him and his ilk in charge?
$C: We have to stop them from turning the internet into an EA game
$C: The internet is dead
$C: Can I help? I'm not from America. 
$C: WE GOT THIS!
$C: I hope Ajit Pai gets raped by a feral pack of niggers.
$C: Hello , i do  not understand one thing , why would the FCC want such things ? Don't they use the internet aswell? Don't they need the internet like us who arent political?  Wouldn't they want free and open internet , some of the FCC chairmen might fap to porn on pornhub and thats completely ok , but they still need free internet to not get embarraresed (just a warning if i said something wrong im from europe and havent been entirely interested in the situation just curious)
$C:      Repealing Net Neutrality will only further damage our economy; the average price for a computer, router, and modem (the essentials for accessing the Internet) is currently $878.78 dollars total, and that's not even counting future expenses. Besides, at the rate Internet-providers obtain money from advertisers and such, taking money from the users is unnecessary.
     Another point I'd like to make is that the Internet is, at its core, a utility for information purposes, *not a business center*. Therefore, adding on to the current expenses of utilizing the World Wide Web by repealing Net Neutrality will only force middle and lower-class citizens to use encyclopedias for information instead and reverting to paper mail--thus losing Internet users and destroying the point of repealing Net Neutrality in the first place, which was to make the rich richer.
$C: While I'm all for Net neutrality.. Title II isn't the answer.. If a real evil person at the FCC decided to actually enforce Title II, this would force broadband to legally transform unregulated information services traffic into regulated telecommunications traffic with cost based metered pricing by law (sections 251(b)(5) & 252(d)(2)(A)). (Kids, ask you parents about cost per minute long distance, and then imagine the same thing for you're internet.)

Remember the last time the FCC imagined that it had the facility and competence to replace the invisible hand of the market with the visible hand of the FCC, it was a disaster, creating mass CLEC bankruptcies (WorldCom, Global Crossing, PSINet etc.), and the destruction of over trillion dollars in wealth. 

What we need isn't some law from 1936, we need a new law one that fits today's world.
$C: Yeah, as long as someone is paying you, you'll dance like a monkey.
$C: How did this happen in land of freedom ? Remove citizens freedom for something thats free and open to all
$C: While a part of me feels scared, depressed and even angry that things turned out as they have, I haven't entirely given up hope yet. I'm still voicing my two cents to my Rep and Senator, I'm still trying to speak out. 

I want to hope that things can be done...but we'll see. ...maybe after 'they' take everything from us, that something can be done about all of this...or not...
$C: R E M O V E C U R R Y
$C: Well, it sucks to suck.
$C: Google.com
$C: As a Canadian is there anything I can do? 
-For Canada's future, but also the States
$C: Aren't 17 states suing the FCC?
$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ-Rhuc7PyU
$C: With net neutrality repealed...we should push the govt to break-up the giant ISPs or at least break between the Lines and the service.   

Generally with more ISPs to choose from ......the prices should go down.  With that said...hopefully this creates enough competition and drive prices down, so we as the comsumers have more choices and purchasing power.  
$C: Wow he really looks like the devil in that picture, really does fit him
$C: Unfucking believable

$C: Fuck you, spez. Such a hypocrite. Wants net neutrality, yet you actively fight against subreddit neutrality. 
$C: And this is why elections matter.

Everyone who voted for Trump and/or for Republicans, the blood is on your hands. Conservatives have shown time and time again they will consistently adapt anti-internet policy. You get what you vote for.
$C: We need to keep fighting. This is such a great community
$C: Yeah echo chamber!!
$C: https://uniteyouthdublin.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/anarchist-cookbook-william-powell.pdf 

Y’all take out and help yourselves, ya hear?
$C: You mean frustratingly predictable. 
$C: Well done Trump voters. Hope you're enjoying America becoming great again!
$C: So none of you find it suspicious that the front page is littered with nn repeal crying?  Step up and think a little bit.  I loved Obama, but to say he was very cozy with big tech is an understatement.  Just maybe letting the mechanisms of capitalism, you know the same ones that provides a working energy grid, or produces the device you shitpost on, maybe those forces aren't evil.  Maybe in 5 years the internet is a better place then it is today.  If it is will you admit all this arm flailing was for nothing and you were wrong?
$C: The problem is we're rallying people who are already on our side. Pretty much everyone on Reddit is for net neutrality.

If we want more support we need to convince those on other social media platforms to get on board. Facebook, instagram, Snapchat, television, radio, etc.
$C: Test "Resist" to 50409 to let your government know how you feel about this. 
$C: I feel like the most crushing feeling is that our Government isn't listening to us. We take action and complain, and even have surveys that show an overwhelming majority of people don't want this to go through, yet it goes through anyway. 

What's the point of even voice our opinions or wants if it's just going to be overruled with ISPs with lobbying power?
$C: How does one make a Internet I’m thinking that we should create are own and have it be run of donations, You know that way it’s free and no one can shut us down then bam good to go no more killing of net neutrality.
$C: FUCK YOU AJIT! 
$C: #You failed!
$C: [drink broth](https://youtu.be/XTuCoU2J4ug) consume all the internet you can
$C: The removal of net neutrality signals the end of one form of American freedom. A freedom which was forged by blood, and sweat. A fight which has been fought since the birth of the nation. The freedom of speech. By adding prices onto certain apps which we used for speech for example, Snapchat. This restrict the ability of some to be able to speak(due to economic differences of being unable to afford it) thus a clear violation of the first amendment "abridging the freedom of speech". While the federal communications commission is not the congress, it still falls congress to maintain such rights are not violated.  If we continue go down this path more and more right will be bought away soon we may has well follow china's atrocious internet path or worse. 
$C: How about you focus on making your website less totally fucking astroturfed? Or better yet, actually make a useful mobile site rather than shoving your nonsensical, ignorant political opinions into what used to be a bastion of free thought on the internet.
$C: So, what's stopping anyone from moving servers and the likes over to somewhere such as Europe?
$C: If everyone just went and invested in substratum we could tell the FCC to fuck off and make our own net neutrality.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Fuuuuck d's Indian bio

$C: Yall should just leave that dump and come to Canada. We have real freedom here
$C: Text "resist" to 50409! You dont even have to talk to anyone to battle for the net, its stupid easy!
$C: This isnt a government of the people. More than 80% of Americans were against this. A lot of people reached out to their senators and congressmen yet this happens
$C: Whatever congress does, it should fucking end with all ISPs being fucking nationalized. You fuck with us we fuck with you.
$C: "Organic Takeover"

🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
$C: Regarding the title: yes, you are done fighting. At least until the end of the Trump administration. That’s going to be either 2020 or 2024. By then, the “internet freedom act” (how Orwellian) will be super entrenched. The fight is over. We lost. The ISPs won. We should vote every incumbent in congress out, regardless of party. I cannot believe this day actually came. This is the one issue that conservatives and liberals actually agree on and big business won anyway. 

Insane. 
$C: Im ready to do whatever is needed to stop this.
$C: fuck off already
$C: Why bother voting? Seriously. Why even bother? Powerful people pull the strings no matter what we do. It's fucking sickening anymore.
$C: Actually “we” are. If “we” couldn’t stop it the first time what makes you think “we” will do any better the second time around?
$C: Lets make a petition, everyone search for petition and if none is made then we will make one and let all of those who are for the net neutrality sign so that we get back our free internet, everyone I don't care where you live just if you are against the idea the say no, if you say it doesn't apply to me and do nothing then I am disappointed. People unite
$C: Reddit might be one of the safest spots on the web because of its safety concerns. Also due to the anonymous nature I believe it is the least narcissistic spot as well. I don't notice too many of those types of celebs on here. Not sure if this was the correct spot to post this comment but I just wanted to thank Reddit for being set up the way that it is. 
$C: So is this good or bad?
$C: Everybody should start tripping about 5G. 
$C: Man, I almost wonder if we should start mass e-mailing churches. Most of these chucklefucks are Republican, and certainly listen to churches and religious organizations more than "regular" voters. Maybe if we convinced the churches to pitch a tantrum over how much this is going to raise their Internet costs, some winds would start to shift.
$C: What does this actually mean; what is going to happen?
$C: Democracy no longer serves justice to the people who are influenced most by it.
$C: I'm wondering will this decision affect the internet service in other countries like Philippines? 
$C: I think it's pretty safe to say that these posts don't mean shit.  We'll cast our meaningless votes next election cycle and the corporate shills will win regardless due to previously instated gerrymandering of districts.
$C: Conservatives want America to be a backwater banana republic where ISPs slow down traffic and block websites as they please, just like the countries in South America that have no net neutrality.
$C: Ok. Here's the thing: Your government representatives literally don't care how many emails, phone calls, or letters they get. The Republicans were voted in by Republicans, who represent a majority of their constituents. They want to be reelected. And so just because they receive a few thousand messages from liberals doesn't mean they'll change their mind, because they represent the people who vote for them.
$C: [NET NEUTRALITY!!!](http://i.magaimg.net/img/23t5.png)
$C: I want to write this here because it won't matter here or anywhere else I write it.

I am from the UK, and see the Usa along with the UK as extremely flawed systems of "democracy". I have voted in two referendums in the UK, one for. Independence for Scotland and Brexit. Both times the tabloid papers have used utter gross and lies to scare people into voting for one side. I have seen my government lie after making promises ever since I began to understand how it all works.

I look at America and its terrible system aswell. The people voted for another but Trump won due to your senators having more power in their vote than yours. Truly baffled by this.

I've seen the online protesting to help stop Net Neutrality, every second post on Twitter, Instagram and Reddit (my main social medias) saying to stop it.

I don't know what democracy is anymore. Is our countries any better than a dictators? A communist lead country? I have no idea. 
$C: I'm generally not a violent person, but DAMN, this is one of the reasons why right to bear arms exists! Elected officials literally ignored the people they are supposed to serve, and then they make fun of those people. Fuck them.
$C: It’s far too likely that with Net Neutrality repealed, we won’t get it back until Ajit or Trump is gone and if the US can get away with it, what’s to stop other countries from doing the same thing? 
$C: It seems this is the one issue that all sides can agree on, its even gotten the attention of Anonymous. The problem is Ajit and how he acts oblivious to all of the people. A complete disregard to the  American people, we aren't worth nearly as much as his check apparently 
$C: I live in Australia. Will I be affected by this? 
$C: "Our Internet rights matter" now print your signs, block your local highways especially if you live near or around the fcc. Make FCC employees lives hell.
Make the FCC fold up and close for good, they don't care about us but to spy on us. It's a useless paid for by tax payer branch of government anyway. 
$C: Congress right now in a nutshell -_-
Slight Profanity Watch it

$C: > *We hope everyone is safe.*

In this regard, you and I disagree.
$C: So what exactly can the ISPs get away with now before the FCC will intervene?
$C: Lol like our voices ever matter. Face it people they don't. Democracy was robbed from us the moment Russia hacked our election and got away with it 
$C: Waaaaahhh
$C: https://dzone.com/articles/why-i-am-against-net
$C: Ajit Pai talked alot about net nuetrality holding back investors, innovation, infastructure, and bandwidth capabilities. I indirectly work for verizon, that is, I work for a HVAC company that installs alot of cooling systems in verizon "data centers" (for lack of a better word because im not very fermiliar with data managment and broadcasting) and if anything i've found in the past year or so we've been doing MORE of these, which makes me want to call bullshit. Is there a place I can find actual numbers/data on bandwith/broadcasting/infastructure growth? Because I would LOVE LOVE LOVE to call bullshit with actual figures
$C: Lol Reddit’s angry 
$C: ... says the company that just added half a dozen advertising and site analytics tracking bugs to their service.

Is Google really going to tell you something you don't already know about your readers?

Well I guess it is nice to know approximately where people live and an estimate of their household income.
$C: Everyone invest in substratum and we are all golden ponyboys!!!!
$C: What else can they do other than slow down speeds on certain websites?
$C: #substratum solves the issue...thank me later
$C: Is anyone happy it's gone? I feel like a .00001 percent minority for once.
$C: Can we use the deep internet and re-develop internet culture there? 
$C: I vote we take away the offical Reddit pages of the companies taking part in all of this, and allow them to pay extra amounts for a Reddit page of their own.
$C: This is only the start to a downward spiral of corruption and less freedom until the point where it's either revolution or nothing will work.

We will see things get worse, slowly, but surely, until, over the coming decades, the government/corporations get too corrupt and we have to revolt. But the good side is after that revolt, peace and prosperity will likely be at an all time high once everything has settled. 

Just a theory, and this may not happen, we can do this without a revolution.

I am just so fucking pissed. Pissed to the point where I am just spouting random shit that may or not be relevant to the situation. That's how bad it is. That's how stressful and worrisome this shit has become.

And this is coming from a conservative for Net Neutrality.
$C: Fuck you Ajit Pai.
$C: Spez is afraid that now that the internet is back under the authority of the FTC, reddit, google, and numerous other monopolies will be broken up.
$C: /u/spez

is there any chance you could work with other big websites to go dark, or at least make it so that users have to click through a bunch of pages before they access the site to protest the decision?
$C: I hate to be the negative Nancy, but this shit is a wrap at least for the next 7-8 years.  
  
we just need to start building our own network like they have done/they do in Cuba.  
  
The Government has shown it's bare ass this entire year under President Trump, writing our government reps is pointless and a waste of bandwidth which will cost now.  
  
I'd rather just create our own private networks, and say fuck all ISP's because if you think ISP's aren't paying Lobbyist assloads of money to prevent a reversal, you're more naive than I was waiting for Santa to show up in the hood on Christmas.  
  
SMH, these crooks on Capitol Hill is just raping the shit out of this country. 
$C: You know, I wonder if this repeal, combined with everything else that has been going on these last few months, will actually cause a massive backfire via backlash. I mean, they just messed with the Internet, even the more lazy among us are likely to get angry.

I am very interested to see what will happen during the coming voting seasons.

@ /u/spez

You and Reddit have had your ups and downs. Support us all now and I doubt many will forget it.
$C: Yes I'll continue to support the repeal of Net Neutrality!!! The only true way to have freedom on the internet is to limit government control!! Stop Net Neutrality!!!!!
$C: I don't care what A-Shit Pie thinks, we will win this, and we will not back down.
$C: Goddamn you Shit Pai

I made this to try and keep people educated and so they’d awaken to what Net Neutrality really is. 
$C: Greetings and blessings from a frustrated Chinese.
$C: [we must have hope](https://youtu.be/Hywyc89uYWw) 
$C: America freedom does not exist and the fcc net neutrality thing proves the point.
$C: So where do we go from here? : (
$C: So i live in the backwoods north east and im broke so donating is not an option but id still very much like to do whatever i can to stop this. If anyone can give me ideas other then writing to my govt official, since im already doing that, id love to hear them.
$C: What can I do if I live in an area where my governor, senators,  and representative support net neutrality?
$C: F
$C: Yup, saw this coming. $$ rules, and Congress bows to it. It really is the end. 
$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8SFbt2t7hc This video makes a great point.
$C: Protect me, your citizen, from both Domestic and foreign enemies!
$C: Look at that FCC guy's eyes. Always wide and bulging. I swear the man is an android. I'm in Canada, but I'm really sorry that went through. There's absolutely no good reason it should have. 
$C: Everyone buy gotennas, we'll create a free and open peer based internet. The ISPs can all burn to the ground.

$C: WE WILL FIGHT AS LONG AS WE CAN
$C: So u/spez, how many board members made political donations to the GOP in the past few years?
$C: Does anybody remember Free TV? It was Free because of Commercials and homeowners had a Antenna on the Roof which received a signal from Huge TV antennas in all cities and blah blah blah.Watch Buzzr TV and the old game shows, they did live commercials.That Money payed for the TV's operation cost and Employees.When cable first came out and My 82 year old Mother can attest to this and She still has the Receipts.A Comcast door to door Salesmen knocked and She let Him in and listened to His speech and the main selling point was there are No Commercials that's why you pay a small fee for the commercial free service.Eventually there were Commercials but very little and Comcast slowly introduced more and more and at same time raised prices little by little.These Company's get plenty of Money from commercials it's a  staggering amount.So now all these Company's follow Comcast way of Business which is greedy.The Money You spend on cable, satellite and now the Internet is Free money for these companies.All those ads you see goes to these companies.You know that extra fee to get HD guess what it's free.I Cut the Cord when everything went digital and now I use the antenna on My roof that's been there since the 80's and everything is in HD while dummies pay for it.These companies slowly try to get away of charging erroneous Fees and charges.If nobody says anything they will continue to Screw the consumer.

$C: Thank you Canada. Please open VPN like Bobs
$C: One thing that I have noticed observing the media coverage of this event is that Ajit Pai's connection to Verizon has been largely unreported to the masses. I think that what needs to happen is that he is exposed for all of his associations and motives. It is obvious to anyone who know his history that his actions are meant to undermine and disenfranchise consumers. 
$C: I posted some similar shit in other subreddits I'm subbed to:

This is representative of a greater, two-fold problem that increased over the past hundred or so years. The Feds were meant to be a limited-purpose, limited-purview branch of government, and even within that, the executive branch did not have the broad rulemaking authority it does today. The Feds have been systematically consolidating authority previously thought to be reserved to the states, and, within the Feds, Congress has been systematically delegating massive swaths of rulemaking authority to the executive branch. What this has produced is a system in which we have to basically cross our fingers and hope that whoever the one guy or gal is that happens to be president just happens to be somebody who's not a complete and total psychopath/idiot, which unfortunately didn't pan out.

How about instead of contacting your reps and senators in Congress about Net Neutrality, you start contacting your reps and senators to give the authority back to you and the other people that live in your state to decide how you all want to live?

How about instead of only getting fired up about this once every 4 years, when the FCC starts threatening Net Neutrality again, you get equally fired up about who your city/town/county officials are? (Who, by the way have been selling you out to cable companies just as hard as Congress has, if not even harder.)

I continue to be dumbfounded at how the current situation is precisely the product of over-regulating, what is in most cases hyper-local, infrastructure, but people continue to believe that the solution is to double down and regulate the regulators. (I am sad that I am missing out on a great opportunity for a Warren G reference but am drawing a blank.)

The reason, though, that people want to go this route is because it is only one law that gets made, which is essentially a duct-tape fix to a giant gaping hole in the wall. Changing one law is easy, but doing things right is rarely ever easy.

The long-term solution is to tell Congress and the executive branch to fuck right off and let you and the people in your state live the way they want to live, within very minimal, but still very important, U.S. Constitutional boundaries. (I'm not advocating for secession or anything. Maybe I am. Fuck.) The long term solution is also to tell your city council or county government to fuck right off and not play favorites with cable companies. None of that is easy, because it involves changing a metric fuckload of laws, and holding a metric fuckload of people responsible, but it's the right way and the long-term way to fix the problem. It also means keeping tabs on all of those people constantly, instead of once every few years when the shit is about to hit the fan.

Seriously, if people on this website are this scared now at the people in Congress, and the only thing the next crop of Congresspeople have to do to undo all of Net Neutrality is repeal one law, how long-term of a solution is that? Do you know how close Congress is to repealing the ACA? Just a couple of elections.

I implore everybody to stop thinking short-term, because that's sort of what's gotten us into this whole mess. Start thinking long-term, and start focusing on the areas in which you wield the most direct power: in your local community, your city, your state. Then when a crazy cheeto becomes president and starts installing a bunch of hoes into positions of authority, you won't have to stress about it too much because they won't really be able to do shit to you anyway.

$C: When things get real... STOP PAYING. ALL OF YOU. Lay off the net for 3 months or longer and lay siege to these mother fuckers. Starve their silly asses right out of a job until competent management steps in and makes correct decisions. If they cannot, the people must rise and make their own connections... I know learning is hard. Download everything you could possibly need (medical dictionaries, automotive, etc.) Buy a hard drive and prepare for the siege. 

We all work together and they will crumble. Be the one that doesn't care and you will affect us all and you will not be forgiven. The time to rise is now. Quit pretending to be powerless. What you buy is power. The time for diplomacy is over. This is now war. Remember, your netflix, video game, social media addiction is what brought this on and this is your one chance to reverse the carelessness of your youth. 

FIGHT! Quit giving these fucking lobbyists money so they can undermine democracy with trickery. I say we start hanging people. If it's ok to go backwards with freedom and liberty it's certain ok to do with civility. If you can't imagine the thought of it coming to this then you need to do something now before you have blood on YOUR hands. The internet is the great equalizer. The guild buster, the union breaker... the source of knowledge for our future. Don't let a few people capitalize on it.
$C: QQ cry babies. 
$C: Nice hypocrisy, but then you've had lots of practice.
$C: Things on the internet was just fine before 2015 and it will be just fine after. 

also fuck you. 
$C: Is this only going to affect the USA?
$C: You and the rest of the tech industry enabled Putinista trollprop.  Is... Is this not what you wanted...?
$C: I thought about getting excited about all of this. Then I realized that I don't really need to worry about it. I don't support greedy corporations and politicians, but it doesn't concern me because I expect a lot of people to start working on projects to work around issues that will arise. In that case, I'll continue reading to see if I can help out, but I don't really care to get involved at this time.

Time to oil the tools again.
$C: The post very nice

$C: Fuck court, hit them in the wallet. It's a business decision. They want money and are paid by businesses that want to extort you. Fuck them. Make a new Internet that doesn't require ISPs. Deny access to wbe sites to ISPs that do not support net neutrality. Make it impossible for any ISP to profit while not supporting net neutrality and they will have no choice but to reverse course.
$C: Wow, this announcement channel sure does get a lot of traction
$C: The internet was just fine before 2015, will be fine again

u/spez, why is r/fuckthealtright allowed and not subs like fat people hate? On a weekly basis I see posts of t_D users posting PMs from other users making threats or otherwise violent, vitriolic comments--sometimes even about their children/family. 

While, it's not clear that these people are coming directly from the sub mentioned, but regardless, your decision to ban r/fatpeoplehate for the specific reason of harassment and yet allow subs which particularly call out a group of people simply for their ideas (supporting Trump, conservativism, libertarianism, etc) seems hypocrital and also counter productive to the primary goal of Reddit which is to spark authentic dialogue and conversation. No one wants to hear what I have to say on the rest of Reddit (by and large), but am I the problem or is it Reddit's policies?

While no one may care, t_D is the **third most active sub** and **the most active non-default sub**. Ultimately though, with an upcoming IPO, your bottom line will become much more important, as no one is going to invest in a POS that can't continue to draw a return and innovate to stay competitive. 

I'm sure you're probably aware of this but, but by sheltering Reddit with double standards it only stands to hurt Reddit; you're cutting yourself off from a broader user base and discouraging more activity (obviously hurting revenue potential). I would post and participate in other subs and enjoy accommodating to their sub culture and probably wouldn't mind targeted ads but I experience such vitriol elsewhere on Reddit, I only participate in t_D and just avoid voyaging elsewhere on Reddit.

Any plans to change?

Thanks.


$C: Chairman Pai!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
$C: Fuck you spez 
$C: I did write to my local representative and well this was the reply...


Dear Mr. Nanan00:

Thank you for sharing your support for net neutrality. I appreciate your input on this timely issue, and it is an honor to represent you in Congress.

In 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted net neutrality to reclassify the internet as a utility and require internet service providers to treat all internet traffic in the same manner. While this sounds fair on the surface, not all internet traffic is equal, nor do consumers value all internet traffic the same. 

By treating all data the same, net neutrality regulations prohibit internet service providers from determining the best network configurations for their consumers' unique needs. Additionally, studies have shown that net neutrality has discouraged investment in broadband networks and infrastructure projects and inadvertently pushed many broadband markets toward monopolistic control with its "one-size fits all" approach. These are troublesome outcomes.

We may disagree on this issue, but be assured that I will keep your concerns in mind, should any legislation affecting net neutrality come up for a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives. Again, thank you for letting me know your opinion. Let's keep in touch, and if I can be of help in the future, don't hesitate to let me know.

Sincerely,
(signed)
Kevin Brady
U.S. Representative
Eighth District of Texas 

P.S. If you want to stay updated on this issue or any of the other important issues facing Congress, please sign up for my newsletter on my home page or follow me on Facebook.
$C: See all we have to do is make a second internet and start using that and making businesses off of that because if people dont want to use the EA internet they can use the nice internet instead and we can basically rebuild all that we have made but with the sole purpose of keeping net neutrality and we can have the creator of it make net neutrality a policy and pass  that along to the next owner when he passes and make it non-removable
$C: Look up the companies that all these providers support and own, then boycott them... Let their movies bomb and ratings drop. I am not going to support the service providers that will continue to cause the issue until they can strong arm it to fruition.

I have Comcast now, I am cutting cable and sharing someones login for programming that I watch because it is difficult to avoid their entire umbrella of things, but I can cut out paying them more than the essentials.

$C: 给顶替嗨go
$C: it technitions and web developers bilingual lol when it comes to code built and made the internet we use..think a few old senators who clearly cant use email even properly as weve seen multiple times can stop the internet ..hahahaha .theyll try,theyll fail and if need be a new age of internet will emerge.

$C: Fun fact: Nothing will change. 
$C: [Contrarian comment that would likely be deleted if I put any more substance into it]

$C: Hahahahahahah

$C: Does this mean that people overseas now won't be able to access US based sites / endpoints without paying? 
$C: Wait it was predictably!?!? Wtf so I lied to me? Made post and upvote all those memes for nothing! I'm outraged!
$C: Hey um, just asking but since the repeal went through, are the effects instant, or will there be a set time before it dies?
$C: Fuck this shit
$C: Welcome to the circlejerk. You just escaped one form of big buisness to become slaves to another. People of reddit you are being played.
$C: Keep fighting! 
$C: Que sera sera.
$C: I don't think people understand the severity of this. For me this isn't just losing YouTube or Reddit. I have family in Kazakhstan that I can only keep in contact with through snail mail or Facebook. I can't afford to be nickel and dimed by companies just to ask them if they're  sick or have electricity. This could tear a part of my family away from me. 
$C: Isn't NN just a way to grant government control over internet content via third parties like Reddit?
$C: keep fighting reddit!!!! call your reps and spread the word
$C: Lol uh oh
$C: Sigh
$C: Hey I'm Canadian but like a violent revolt would sound pretty good right about now. 
$C: This is a perfect example of why executive agency made law  is sooo bad. Congressional made regulations are much more difficult to change unlike this where the FCC can change on a whim
$C: https://dbr.ee/kIBA
$C: Darn
$C: Thanks for the update and sum up.
$C: Why is the Net Neutrality problem ever a thing? Why does a company in their right mindset want to willingly charge people for the internet? Does it not affect them?
$C: Gentrification of the fucking internet why is anyone surprised. Fuck Trump. Fuck Ajit Pai. Most of all fuck America for letting our country come to this fucking shit. How can people do this.
$C: Gold!
$C: I know many of you are advocating to vote in the next election, and while I agree with that, I think we've got to do more than rely on politicians to make changes. Didn't Google come out with the Google Loon which provides internet via a balloon technology? 

In this day and age, surely we can come up with new innovative technology for internet connection beyond what the current ISPs provide, or at least some software to get around this repeal. Isn't the "free market" and "competition" what these corrupt people are touting after all?

Yes, we should continue to vote for people who actually have our best interests at heart, but I wouldn't solely rely on them. Politicians may start out with good intentions, but the system and the promise of $$$ can corrupt them - they're human after all. 

In response to the repeal, can we en masse beg Google or Elon Musk to save us? If millions are demanding a solution that they'd be more than willing to pay for, wouldn't they want to supply? Perhaps we can pander to the greatest engineers and technologists to craft a solution. NOW is the time for our Robin Hood.

I don't know if any of this actually even makes sense or is feasible, I'm sorry if it doesn't. I'm just really desperate to do more than rely on politicians. I've already been contacting my reps as often as possible and spreading the word. If there's more I can do, I want to.
$C: If by some grace of whatever superpower watching us, that they manage to pull off the impossible and retract the repeal, someone seriously needs to make a parody of Pai having a pot of molten gold dumped on his ugly fat head like Bitchboy had in Game of Thrones
$C: The fight is far from over. 
$C: This is the Braveheart freedom speech of the internet
$C: \>organic takeovers

I'm sure those 2 and 300k upvoted posts in subs with 5k subscribers were completely organic.


$C: Whats the difference with the FCC doing this and SPEZ censoring particular subreddits?
$C: How does this affect VPN services?
$C: Is there a way to anonymously support net neutrality?  Something that doesn't require giving out my email address, phone number, or physical address and potentially getting spammed?
$C: Question,  does net neutrality affect porn?
$C: Does anyone else find it annoying that he wrote update instead of edit?
$C: Let's just all call their offices at once
$C: Everyone  start sharing #SaveNetNeutrality to bring back the free internet.
$C: FUCK
$C: Shouldn't you guys go on strike? Organize a protest in front of the FCC building, in front of the white house, and in front of wherever that Indian bastard works at. Set-up camp, be loud, show them that behind every e-mail there's a person.


DO NOT break cars and random property though. That seems to be a problem with strikes these days.
$C: 1. Come on Anonymous do your thing!

2. Although it doesnt directly effect Australia or the UK (yet!), there has been no coverage on the front page/webpages of the bigger news outlets.... Bit strange to me, maybe these companies are benefiting?
$C: This is a fictional nightmare right?
$C: Maybe if you had followed had followed Andrew's vision instead of selling out, I would have given a fuck, but FUCK YOU, SPEZ... you sold us out years ago, cunt. 
$C: Too bad we can't really fight them. FCC literally needs and deserves a foot in the ass.
$C: does this net thing mean i should overload my phone with porn ?
$C: “Let’s prevent a monopoly by trusting the largest monopoly in the country to overlook and enforce a monopoly with more expensive regulations and restrictions and limit smaller companies from expanding with expensive hoops to jump through”
We were just fine before 2015, we’ll be just fine without it. 
$C: No, because you want to burn the internet in this country to the ground.
$C: It's not the FCC or ajit pee, it's simply the level of corruption, it is so blatant, we the people are so disregarded, and rightfully so, we have voted these two parties to the top of the food chain D & R, democrats and republicans, conservatives blame liberals, liberals blame conservatives, the bottom line is nobody looks at other parties, small that they are but it is up to the millennials now, people my age and older can't seem to break the addiction to the D&R.

The democrats and republicans, my generation, we have robbed the future for the now, yes, it has been good times but at some point the party is over and my generation can't seem to break the cycle that we are in, if you the millennials follow our footsteps then this is only the tip of the iceberg as control and corruption grow ever more because of the system these parties have in place, we can still have it good but it's up to the millennials and younger one's, my generation is powerless over the 2 headed snake.

$C: This vote is not only important for the USA, but for the rest of the world. 

If it comes through, ISPs in Europe are very likely trying to increase their power here too.

Non-Neutrality and censorship IS the death to the internet, and brings a very few companies incredible power
$C: ##FUCK SPEZ
$C: From what I can tell although the FCC went through with their expected assholery, they won't be able to get this past the courts unless legal system is completely broken. 
$C: I'm not from US. How can I help?
$C: Nice 
$C: Why don’t you shut down the site for a day with a message about Net Neutrality and send the world a *real message*?

Talk is cheap, and we know changing the logo isn’t working.
$C: oh no, going to have to pay 2$ more for netflix which I dont use anyways!
$C: [Please subscribe to (TimeWarner™ Package) in order to view this content.]
$C: War is just begun...
$C: Can't websites and social media such a reddit, Facebook 4chan etc simply embed information about the FCC and NN notifying everyone of what to do while all this is going on? I'm seeing posts about it with a Max of 200k upvotes why can't this stuff hit 700k+ when it's something so important.
$C: As far as I can see, no one is actually doing shit about this besides hitting up their local politicians. So please explain what you mean by "done fighting"? I think it's about time we start actually fighting this. We need to take to the streets to be heard if necessary. 
$C: just 5 people get to decide this?
$C: mhm.  Don't you think you're making the situation worse by allowing alt right mods to corrupt subreddits?  By being complacent with t_d?  I like reddit, but right now you're turning a blind eye to a terrorist factory.
$C: Nothing is going to change. The Internet will be the same as it was before.
$C: Bullshit...about time obama shit is being dismantled.

$C: Glad to live in europe but jesus christ this is fucked up
$C: Spez, how about you actually have neutrality here on reddit. But no, you edit users comments and shadowban users.

Hypocrit. 
$C: Well, the United States Rich Kids just said to the Poor one in the room "now you gotta pay to access all of this culture, good or bad". Hopefully you'll end up waking up from Racketland. 
$C: Is it even possible to turn this around by voting or is it just gonna be voted among these 5 people?
$C: Honestly if this crap goes through and it’s a failure. I’m honestly not afraid to stop using my phone and online services. One thing that would hurt his if people would stop using such services that it hurts their profits. 

Not saying to go back to old fashion ways. But the less people that use the online services and such, the less profits they make and will hurt them.
$C: We should start our own internet. With blackjack. And hookers.
$C: I think this problem goes beyond the US and we should all fight this as a community regardless of the country we live in. I live in France and talk about the vote around me. It was scary that most people don't even know what net neutrality is, even less about what they are planning to do. But every one I talked to felt this was wrong. I hope net neutrality was discussed properly in  the medias, in school etc. This matter is very frightening to me and I feel like I can't do much about it... 
$C: In the meantime, American redditors need to monitor for any bad activity by the ISPs, raise awareness of it and put pressure on the FTC in these cases.

NN is likely gone until at least 2021 bar a succesful legal challenge. You now have ro adjust to that reality. It stinks, but life often does.
$C: Nothing makes sense in this world

$C: What a fucking travesty of justice. This Ajit Pai clown is making a mockery of a supposedly democratic country.

This is very bad news for the entire world.

There should be a referendum for something so important. And it should be conducted on an open source blockchain.

Please support projects like Substratum which can help keep the Internet from those that wish to control it.
$C: When Reddit, multiple international companies and the ISPs themselves are for something... you should pause and question the real motives considering that latter group should, theoretically, stand to gain more with the Net Neutrality bill gone.
$C: This makes me just irate. Vote these GOP scum the hell out of office. This isn't a partisan issue. Only the GOP wants this to happen. Kick these bastards to the curb as soon as possible!


$C: Substratum. If you can't work with them- go around them.
$C: As a non-American who never had residence in the United States I feel that this decision would greatly affect me as well since many of the services we use over here are American and many of the content that I browse is in English. It feels terrible having such a big thing happening and not being able to do anything about it really. :-/
$C: propagandists are always so wordy
$C: /u/spez You talk about net neutrality but moderators abuse their power and ban people who disagree.

$C: Ajit how does it feel to have not only destroy your life....but your children's as well
$C: Help us building a list of opinions on Net Neutrality on Agreelist: http://www.agreelist.org/a/net-neutrality
$C: One-Example-Of-Many :: Netflix could never have started up without net neutrality. Company-x could start a streaming service to compete with Netflix then begin throttling Netflix to drive business elsewhere. No one would watch Netflix if there were signal delays resulting in screen pixelation or buffer loads. Yep, China's internet is regulated by the government and ours is regulated by uber capitalism.
$C: Two organic takeovers of the front page of Reddit? Wow, world changing activism.

Oh and phonecalls too, wow, no wonder this passed. 

If you want to affect policy you have to be organised and you have to be willing to confront, demonstrate, picket and occupy in the living flesh.

You spend too much time here if you think you can affect policy by staying in your comfort zone and glued to your phone.
$C: Probably should scratch out the word "Democracy" and replace it with "Corporate Capatalism" and "voters" to "bribed politicians" in text books now.
$C: Thank you for all you are doing.
While I am in Australia and across the world, I know that without strong opposition this will pass and start a tide that will become impossible to stop.

Not America's voice, but the world's.
The internet's.

$C: And they say rich people don’t run the world lol. We never get what they want and they just put through whatever makes them money.
$C: Yep, going to start setting up my mesh network system.  
 
 
$C: *ITS THE LAST STAND OF THE SAMURAI*
$C: EXCUSE ME!!  HOW do 5 people get to decide what effects millions and millions of people. It seems to me that "We the people" should get to vote on this issue. Anyone?  Anyone?  Buehler?  
$C: Let's set fire to the fucking rain.
$C: You say you're fighting for neutrality, but your censoring pro America opinions on your own site lmao 
$C: Let the free market reign. 
$C: Look at Substratum they solve this problem!

$C: But... Can't we just vote to get this guy removed from office?
$C: It’s quite alarming how many society-shaping decisions are being made by a vote in closed committee 3-2. There was no way we were going to Shape the fcc. But we can shape congress. 

Let them know that 2018 is an election year and we will replace them if they don’t take a stand. Make them declare their stance on this issue and get them the hell out of there if they don’t align with your views. 
$C: Never give up. Never surrender. 
$C: I'm annoyed and I don't even live in the US. I sincerely hope this doesn't pass through congress.
$C: This is a bunch of bull****. Some people in areas such as mine only have access to one ISP meaning that there’s no other options so we’re stuck with whatever this company decides to do. We can only hope that congress shuts it down but it is unlikely. The last thing I want to do is pay 50 dollars a month for a gaming package or another 50 for Netflix or other video media that I previously got for much less.
$C: Even the mods think he's a shit pie
$C: Thanks for giving a voice to the human garbage that support this decision and the president who sold your entire government.
$C: The fight for NN was lost *last* November.  The people of this country spoke and said they clearly don't give a shit about it. 

 Good job 'Murica! 

 :rolleyes:
$C: Yeah reddit usually buzzes for stuff you shove in their faces as fact not bothering to read what Net Neutrality actually is. Or if you did you're fine with free speech suppression and monopolies. But hey. Whatever. You do you.
$C: first ea then this cuck tough break for reddit
$C: Maybe company's who support #NetNeutrality should slow the speeds of those who appose it. 
$C: Looks like you need some freedom over there murica. Make us a cuppa and ask nicely.
$C: I really hope this shot never happens again
Because this battle was stressful as fuck
$C: You guys are looki by at this way too one sided. Remember no result is for sure and we will have to see how this truly plays out. Net neutrality has only existed for two years and America did fine in the decades before. Remember internet is not a necessity, it is not a utility. Also with our internet power now in the hands if private iragn8zations and can go one of two ways. We will either get insanely taxed by our internet providers, and decent internet will become an expensive to pay luxury, or, and I'm hoping for the best here so this is how ik hoping it'll play out, not only will the capabilities if out internet connection improve tremendously, the price for consumers may stay stable due to the fact that advertisers will have to pay out much more money so their videos will load quickly on sights. This will hopefully bring in more money to businesses, supplementing for the cease to net neutrality. 
$C: Spez you are not a good person. 
$C: The timing could not be better for the GOP... the FCC has everyone up in arms and distracted by net neutrality, meanwhile congress is hashing out a massive tax cut for the wealthy paid for by massive debt, cancellation of myriad social programs, tax increases on the working and middle class, and a total destruction of our economy. 
$C: i’ll just jailbreak my internet and bypass their bs restrictions 
$C: With 3 votes, they:
-Screwed over most teachers and students, who use the internet to educate and learn respectively.
-Screwed over millions of people.
-Proved they don't care about public opinions. Just sweet, sweet cash.
$C: That's right. Fight big business by being the useful idiots for even bigger business.
$C:  Think someone doxxed Ajit Pai
$C: So, u/spez, want to remove T_D now, or still feel like feeding them more wins and compromising the merits of your own website on the grounds that the free speech rights of intolerance must be tolerated and facilitated? Y'know, doing the sort of thing that a professional business does and for which the moderators of your site claim liberties to do so all the time?

Ah, sensationalism, the quick buck!

Then setting 1 particular subreddit to not appear at the top because of 'vote manipulation.'

I mean, I get disagreeing with people, even thinking that they are terrible human beings... but claiming neutrality while doing the opposite from a position of power just doesn't sit well with me. 
$C: Listen, does the loss of net neutrality contradict the first amendment, free speech? I know this is going to the court soon probably but this is definitely an issue we the people can push.
$C: So now voter fraud is a problem?
$C: Oh, so takeovers of the front page are inspiring now, are they?
$C: I don't see the bad side to this
$C: Im starting to think this is good thing. The more they push us the more we will innovate to get around their systems. Keep pushing your state for privatized ISP's and purchase service through them.
$C: The fight is only done when we all give up in my eyes.  
$C: This might get lost in the sea of comments. But how can other countries outside the US actually lens a hand in this fight? 
$C: If i'm from another country, is there anything i could help? 
Because somehow it will backlash to us
$C: People want to yell about BIG Government and free market, but it is the government’s responsibility to protect the people from corporate greed. This repeal is only for the sake of large corporations and the people who are in their pocket. No matter how they want to spin it. 
$C: Vote with your wallet.  We should all be sending a few bucks to each(or maybe like 3) of the candidates who tried to protect us.  Also cancel your cable or cell phone for a month if you can.
$C: Somehow the earth is still spinning and the poles have not reversed.
$C: I would like to ask a simple question. When has the government every “effectively” stepped in and made things better. You are giving the government power to enforce rules on the internet with net neutrality. How long will it be before the government is bought out and creates an artificial crises to give big corporations what they want?

I mean, just because they CAN start charging us for using the internet, that doesn't necessarily mean they WILL do it. Especially considering the amount of backlash this has gotten.

$C: Can someone explain to me what the big deal is? Reddit seems to be the only platform where the opinion is so one sidedly directed towards supporting net neutrality. Major news networks didn't even put this repeal of net neutrality in their headlines. Why? I don't know much about net neutrality and I'm not gonna take a position on supporting it, but people here are for sure exaggerating the magnitude of removing net neutrality. Can some level headed person explain?
$C: I just thought about this: 

Trump promised a wall when he was getting elected. But by no means did i think both physcial wall and a pay wall would be put up.. Dear God what's next

$C: For the amount of outrage in favour of net neutrality, there's a pathetic amount of clear good in-depth honest analysis of pros and cons that acknowledge and don't misrepresent the least-bad arguments/excuses of the other side and why they are wrong.
$C: Soooo.... Can we just state that if any internet company begins to pull this, the kid gloves are off? Sorry but I REALLY would like to be there for the modern day Salem witch trials. 
$C: You're political hacks. 
$C: FCC won the battle, but not the war.
Don't forget that, fellow redditors.
$C: I personally think we should take this out on the streets. Protest, march and do something. The internet is so big and is represented only in a number on the screen, on the street, when we walk out and represent ourselves we might get somewhere. 
$C: Waaaaahhh
$C: If bigger corporations are working against consumer freedoms for the internet, why haven't we worked harder to change the way the internet is accessed in the first place? Why are we forced to choose between very limited unsatisfactory service providers that reach a rural area, instead of setting up systems to easily establish our own connections outside of the control of an isp, for instance? 
$C: Wow he really looks like the devil in that picture, really does fit him

Because yes, internet neutrality is the Dark Souls of politics.
$C: Fuck u/spez

Fuck NN
$C: !RemindMe 12 Months "Fuck u/spez, he was wrong. He also called telecoms terrorists.'
$C: NN was implemented in 2015, the same time Google went aggressive on suppressing conservative/anti-'progressive' angenda views on searches. Soros funding the misinformation push for pro net neutrality--the same man who helped Nazis find Jewish properties during ww2, funds Antifa, and is widely known for destablizing economies. Soros admits on the 60min interview he cares not for social consequences of this. You're all being fooled with these articles on NN; they're funded propaganda to make you all believe NN is a good thing, when in fact it empowers government regulations on what we see on the web. The very essence of these pushes are contradictory to what NN has actually been doing after it was implemented in 2015. Don't be fooled peeps.  
$C: We need to maintain a free and open internet, we cant be overlooked by the government, everyone must do everything they can to help. Without net neutrality all of the american redditors will not be free to speak up on important topics and questions raised on this site. #freetheinternet

$C: I finally get it now! We need to make sure that the Trump White house has as much regulating power over the internet as possible. We can't trust the ISPs to decide what is or is not able to be seen because another one would just pop up and decide that people should be allowed to see that content. We need President Donald Trump himself telling ALL ISPs what is or is not legal content that way whatever he decides is illegal will never be able to be seen by anyone whether the ISPs or the people agree or not. Not only that, Donald Trump needs to be able to set the prices for the ISPs, since he is arguably the most successful businessman in the world he shouldn't have any problem knowing how much it costs to run an ISP.

I had thought that almost all of reddit hated Donald Trump but thanks to this post and the other NN subs I'm glad to find some like minded people. We need Net Neutrality! Dont let Ajit Pai allow Trump to think we don't want them to have control over the internet. Send Trump a message proving his supporters are in favor of Net Neutrality! The only way we know the internet will remain free is if President Donald Trump can control it!!!
$C: Here's Roy Blunt's reply to me.  What a hack.

"Thank you for contacting me regarding the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and its recent vote to overturn the 2015 Open Internet Order. 

In February 2015, the FCC voted to impose unnecessary, monopoly-era regulations on today’s competitive broadband marketplace. I commend the FCC’s decision to return to the light-touch regulatory approach that, for decades, enabled the internet to promote job growth and generate nearly $1 trillion in economic investment.  

The Open Internet Order created a barrier to the investment and innovation our country needs to grow the economy and close the digital divide between rural towns and bigger cities. According to the FCC, broadband investment has decreased for two years in a row, marking the first time this has occurred, outside of a recession, in the internet era.  This investment matters to thousands of Missourians that still struggle to obtain access to broadband services.

The internet must remain free and open to legal content.  This principle does not require additional government regulation, and under current law and regulations, safeguards and consumer protections remain in place.  As a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, I will keep your thoughts in mind should issues related to this come before the committee for consideration.

Again, thank you for contacting me.  I look forward to continuing our conversation on Facebook (www.facebook.com/SenatorBlunt) and Twitter (www.twitter.com/RoyBlunt) about the important issues facing Missouri and the country.  I also encourage you to visit my website (blunt.senate.gov) to learn more about where I stand on the issues and sign-up for my e-newsletter.

Sincere regards,

Roy Blunt
United States Senator"
$C: You can still go fuck yourself spez.
$C: TRUMP2020 fucking snowflakes
$C: top kek
$C: fuck off deep state, you lost
$C: !RedditSilver
$C: You're going to lose, in no small part because of the divisions the left-wing social media companies have put into our society over the last year.

If you San Francisco types hadn't gone all-out on the censorship, you'd be getting a lot more support right now. But if you're already going to censor people, why should conservatives care? And without us backing you up, Donald Trump just doesn't care what you have to say. He cares what people who vote for him think, but like most politicians, if you don't vote for them, you can pound sand.

And the entire liberal social media complex made extremely sure that conservatives and Republicans were not, on average, going to be calling congress over this.
$C: Do ISPs have monopolies over states in America? Without competition this could be very bad.
$C: Guys, I’m all for NN, but don’t freak out so much ab this. No buisiness in their right mind would ever start restricting websites, let along restrict them immediately after the bill passes. Seriously think about this. IK this is going to get downvoted to hell because it’s an unpopular opinion, but every card has two sides, and it’s unjust to blindly follow one side without completely understanding the other. Nothing will change. If your company decides to fuck up your internet, switch companies. That’s how the free market works. One thing that I haven’t heard them reporting about is the increased transparency with the removal of net net neutrality. If an ISP is throttling bandwidth, they are required to be public about this. There is no internet-pocalypse. I’m not some govt. cronie, I’m just someone who takes time to research and fully explore every side of every arguement. If reading this made you upset, than that means you probably aren’t capable of reading an anti-NN article with an open mind, and thats not good. There has been so much misinformation spread about net neutrality that it’s disgusting.

$C: At what point can ajit pie can be sued for fraud? 
$C: Anyone else think that www.reddit.com (and/or other popular websites that benefit from net neutrality) should temporarily redirect to a "404. Net neutrality not found" webpage of some sort? maybe just make sure those of us anticipating it can work around it? It would be a pain in the arse for anyone already aware of the net neutrality BS the federal government is pulling, but it would be a lot more effective than simply making an announcement like this. In any case, it's not like it would be much worse than what would happen to the site if team cable gets its way

$C: How do you get your hair so white? Cum?
$C: This irritated me to no end. There was no organization unlike the sopa/pipa battle years back. The best the tech giants did was put up a shitty banner saying 'we care about net neutrality'. This is the equivalent of protesting by liking a Facebook post. It means nothing. When sopa/pipa was under fire, Google and reddit and Amazon actually interfered with their services so that they would no longer work at a high speed. This was a real protest. Two weeks ago we memed. What a fucking joke.

$C: Net neutrality is a joke. 
$C: Is it possible to create a separate network that bypasses what the ISPs provide? Maybe have everyone VPN so that all traffic looks identical? Creative solutions that give them the finger?
$C: Seems everyone forgot about this lol. Guess we all learned is that net neutrality is just a fucking meme.
$C: Let me get this straight. You are against the government NOT regulating the internet.  So you go to the FCC to protest? This is almost too funny to be true. So for a few years we had government regulation. And now we don't.  And strangely my internet cost has basically doubled for the same speed and I haven't even seen are major improvements in the infrastructure for the future.  If any. It's at a snails pace.  No thanks to government intervention. 

So the big concern here is the power hungry big business corporations that created jobs and was part of the DOT.com BOOM that had ZERO regulations is the bad guy. And you want the crooked evil poorly run government to get their hands in it and waste more of your hard earned tax money?  

Are we complaining just to complain because it's different and it's what your political party wants? Or is it what you "think" can or will happen? Or is it what you where told by the mainstream media and your constituents.  

Seems to me this is no more than a political move to make a point about having more government control and more control over the people.  And if the big concern here is dollars being taken from your pocket from a corporation/business is your problem.  Why are you okay with it going into the governments pockets via tax? 

We could develop this into a tax argument.  And the answer would be corporations pay taxes. And you would come back and say they don't pay enough.  And then I would say that these job creators not only create tax payers but they also pay into most of the taxes collected as a whole. 

In the end. This whole argument is nothing more than a power grab and fear is the weapon of choice to take control of a free market. 

I say let the best man win. I love competition. It's what made America great! Most of you won't get that last remark because you don't want to see that happen. You have a different vision. Big government power grab and control. Pulling wool over your eyes.

$C: Why fight for net neutrality while imposing content limits here?
$C: The FCC clearly are not interested in listening what can we do to remove the FCC from power?
$C: I feel like we have made our feelings clear so many times over the past 10 to 15 years and they really don't care about what we think. This is why young people lose faith in democracy, we shout and shout, we speak to our congress peeps who have already sold their soul and it results in nothing but a pause. FCC is just a front to blame for removing net neutrality while everyone in Government is blameless. Wish we could do more than what we have been doing. 

How do we change the FCC mission statement to protect net neutrality? Can we create a new organisation that has as much power for this purpose? what are the options as this cycle means we lose an inch again and again. It's just painful to watch. This is not democracy... Who are the citizens who want this? What reasons do they have to support this loss of net neutrality? It seems to me that the only people who would support this are the corporations. How about boycotting these companies who are bribing everyone? We have the power we just need some intelligent ideas?
$C: Who do I need to kill?
$C: Reddit today: fuck we missed it
$C: new initiative if internet neutrality gone for web sites owners.

hello, as net neutrality may be impacted in USA and would impact all web sites owners who have customers in USA. I am trying to make an initiative to get small web sites owners together who are small or can not afford make a deal with USA ISP by themselves, or outside USA. I will gather them and once i reach a good number of web sites and incase the appeal rejected, i will proceed to communicate with USA ISPs to reach a fair deal to avoid any impact on small web sites and small online business owners.

most probably, Telecom operators will not waste time to make deals with small guys. so i am trying to make it easy for both sides by making the mediator system and handling agreements.i am building a backend server to be ready for integration with ISP networks when needed, supporting different protocols and interfaces to provide participating web sites names to the operators.

Introduction about me: i am a professional web developer and entrepreneur, i own a couple of sites with customers in USA, I am a telecom engineer worked for Telecom operators for 11 years around the world specially in the part of traffic control and was involved in the contract management and network planning for telecom operators for along time before.

i made a small page to collect web sites for those who want to participate: www.ISPquality.com > you must be the web site owner or the main responsible for it.
$C: wow a lot of gold in this thread

Allowing businesses to freely compete will lower prices for the consumer having large companies like Netflix Amazon Google having to pay more for their bandwidth instead of us paying more for our bandwidth would be better for the consumer net neutrality is designed to keep corporations paying a smaller amount even though they use way more bandwidth those cost get pushed onto the consumer.

The cost always has to go somewhere and if someone's getting a better deal cuz there a big company who do you think it's shuffled with the cost?

Don't blame me why are such large companies backing net neutrality and they're getting the brain dead mob to go along with?


$C: Isn't the whole point of ending net neutrality to flag ISPs who are abusing it? If anything ending "net neutrality" will make it more fair for everyone IMO. Right now techies have a massive advantage in the world. Some are hooking up like 50 smartphones to a computer and bitcoin mining all day using more energy than a third world country.   
The fact thay everyone is always whining about inequality yet is against ending net neutrality is incredibly ironic to me.   
I don't think your average Joe will notice a difference if nn is ended, I figure they limit everyone to 2tb a month or something which is way more than enough right now. But human greed will likely make this all end with Comcast rubbing their nipples :/

$C: #I FUCKING LOVE THIS LEVEL OF BUTTHURT 
$C: Remember, not all Reddit users support Net Neutrality.
$C: Just came to laugh at all the melting snowflakes who love freedom of speech all of a sudden. 
$C: If you guys don't like no governmental regulations, why don't you stop complaining and do something about it by moving to China. They have government regulated internet!
$C: Net neutrality is dead. This is a good thing.

Even if there were no other compelling arguments in favor of killing net neutrality (though there are), the end of net neutrality would be welcome because it will frustrate the hopes of the largest group temper tantrum thrown by non-toddlers in recent American history.

Has this country ever seen a more simperingly childish mob than the one responsible for the outcry over this boring prudential question concerning the allocation of hertz? Has so much canned emotion ever been spilled over so bland and technocratic and uniquely prudential an issue? Having strong feelings about net neutrality — which essentially mandates that your internet service provider treats all internet traffic and data equally — is like getting upset over a public-access TV debate on the generic ballot or the proceedings of the House of Representatives Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans, and Insular Affairs.

If nothing else, ludicrous statements like the one from the heads of the New York, Brooklyn, and Queens Public Library systems calling the proposed change "appalling" and the gravest threat to education this country faces do the helpful work of reminding us that, like public schools, libraries in this country are now little more than transmission centers for digital entertainment.

Meanwhile, Ajit Pai, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, has received death threats against his children. A man in Syracuse is facing federal charges after leaving a voicemail at the office of Rep. John Katko (R-N.Y.). "Listen Mr. Katko, if you support net neutrality, I will support you. But if you don't support net neutrality, I will find you and your family and I will kill you all. Do you understand? I will literally find all of you and your progeny and just wipe you from the face of the Earth." The FCC hearing itself had to be briefly evacuated Thursday after someone apparently called in a bomb threat. The only difference between the hordes of fideistic pro-net neutrality campaigners and the #GamerGate movement is that the former have been officially sanctioned by right-thinking liberals, who never miss an opportunity to shill on behalf of capital.

Indeed, from Teen Vogue to TheWashington Post to GameInformer.com, liberal opinion is united in its opposition to net neutrality. But on its face, net neutrality is absurd. The idea that internet service providers should be forced to provide unlimited access to content transmitted indiscriminately whether it is old episodes of Sesame Street, pornographic videos of simulated rape, or a column at The Week, makes as much sense as saying that a brewing company should be able to suck up all the water in a river so long as people like drinking it. We do not force bookstores to stock certain volumes or restaurants to prepare every conceivable dish. The prospect of a segregated internet in which much of the crap now gumming up the works remains legal but available only to those willing to pay a premium to access it is a welcome one.

But there is another aspect of this debate that is rarely mentioned, one that deserves a certain amount of consideration. In the last decade the internet has changed every aspect of our lives in ways that we have largely accepted without a moment's hesitation.

As but one example: Was it a good thing — for people, commerce, or art — that Netflix destroyed the video store industry? As Matt Novak observed recently, the replacement of Blockbuster by online streaming has not meant that we are all allowed to watch whatever movies we like all the time. Say what you want about the musty old Family Video where the only thing more remarkable than the number of cigarettes the middle-aged woman behind the counter smoked was her apparently endless ability to enjoy Ben-Hur on VHS; at least it had Citizen Kane and Seven Samurai on the shelves in addition to the latest Hollywood garbage. Meanwhile, what about all the people who used to make $35,000 a year managing their local corporate video franchise, to say nothing of all the teenagers and 20-somethings who used to stand behind the counter? Was it worth it so that a much smaller number of programmers and executives could a good deal more money and you can enjoy Wolfcop without putting on clothes? What was wrong with going to the store and picking out a CD (and songwriters making money from the sale) instead of letting a YouTube algorithm decide what song you stream next?

I rather like that "throttle," a good old-fashioned strong verb that meant "strangle or kill" before it was an engineering term, has become the word we use to refer to the practice of internet service providers hindering the transmission of pornographic videos, online shoot-em-up games, and HBO reruns. These are all things that deserve to be throttled. Throttle away.
$C: Shit, I hope nobody was dumb and threatened violence. That's no way to go about this.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I like how all the neckbeards on this site immediately resort to violence when their precious internet is threatened but bringing up violence as a solution to things they agree with is inhumane. 

What a cesspit of pseudo intellectual nobodies. 
$C: Love how people are so uninformed about Net Neutrality. Unhinged and completely uninformed enough to call in bomb threats. Repeal keeps the government out of your internet and enables it a truly creative free and uncensored medium. But when uninformed and unhinged the left wing will terrorize or call in Jessica Chobot to whine. 
$C: You caused this, u/spez . By allowing The_Donald to fester and promote that disgusting lunatic, you helped put Pai in as the commissioner of the FCC and helped destroy the internet. The same internet that made you and your cronies so fucking rich. You should be ashamed of yourselves, and I mean throwing up, crying, staying in bed all day ashamed. Rot in hell with the fascist monsters you helped put in power, asshole.

EDIT: HA! look at all the brigading triggered nazi supporting Trumpmonsters! A message for you: We will not forget this time in history. You will, each and every one of you, be hunted down and brought to justice eventually. You cannot hide.
$C: Please everyone keep fighting. We will likely not see any changes until the dust settles and people forget. They are playing dirty. Remember none of them are fighting for your interests.

If you are able, hurt the ISPs with your wallet and cancel service, state this as a reason. Do not vote for anybody in favor of this outcome and make it known why you are voting as such. Support small businesses often.
$C: u/spez: "WILL SUCK DICKS FOR SHAREBLUEBUX."
$C: We won the first the battle. Now we need to fight to get the government further out of business. The government needs to stop propping up bad businesses. Give competitors a chance otherwise the end of net neutrality will hurt us instead of helping us.

The repeal of Net Neutrality is just a small positive step in a difficult path to restore individual freedom and free market rights.The fight is gonna be pretty hard going forward. Government control and overreach is everywhere and isnt going to let go easily.

Please if you use a service that takes advantage of its freedom and abuses you as its customer, dont stand for it. Cancel that service. Spend your money on the better businesses that will stand against them and offer good services and packages. And when you vote in politics vote decrease the federal government power over voluntary interactions.

We can have liberty from false authority and we can have liberty to do business outside of that false authority.


$C: Let's make those last minute phone calls,  I don't think it's set yet! 
$C: But the vote isn't even starting yet? reverse /r/prematurecelebration
$C: Hmm I wonder if certain members of this tiny community were bribed 🤔 
$C: Chairman Pai, Commissioner O'Rielly and Commissioner Car all mentioned that this vote will return the internet to a "light touch" regulatory style. I recall that there were several developments, including certain court decisions, that led the Obama Administration to implement Title II regulations. Does anyone have a convenient list of these developments, and a summary of why a "light touch" regulatory style will no longer effectively protect consumers as a direct result of these developments?
$C: It's been said before but why not set up a legitimate crypto fund with donation wallets that can be used to lobby for net neutrality. Money talks.
$C: There's nothing we can do now except fight in court and then hopefully put in a new head of FCC who supports us.

At the moment though, this is a complete wash and there's absolutely nothing I, as a citizen, can do that I already haven't been doing already.

I'm just tired of this fight, I'm tired of every year having to call up and have the representative on the other side of the phone give me a generic non-answer, or better yet, a form letter when I send emails.


$C: TIME TO BLOW UP THE FUCKING PHONES

$C: u/arabscarab are you an actual Arab? And what's your favorite Arab food? And how will it affect the FCC?
$C: #notmyinternet
$C: Remember when we fought for our independence from GB by posting memes on the community message boards? 

Or when we won the fight for the 40 hour work week solely based on phone calls and letters to congressmen? 

Hey it worked those times, it’ll work again right? Everyone make reddit threads and comment saying how much you don’t want it to happen. Historically that’s how Americans have made great changes.


$C: Who cares..... absolute snoozefest
$C: Communists fail at just about everything except for starving contests.
$C: fuck /u/spez 
$C: Fuck you r/Spez. How about some net Netrality laws for Reddit?
$C: Rip the Internet, late 2015-2017      
$C: The salt mines are rich today
$C: Fuck people who voted Trump and destroyed one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century. 
$C: Christ, maybe American run subreddits will stop polluting Reddit with their regional politics. Keep your stupid net neutrality ads to yourself
$C: Does this include getting rid of the admins who openly show hatred for /r/The_Donald and were shown to have preferred to remove it for not fitting with their line of thinking? Does this include removal of the CEO who edited comments that hurt his feelings when his administration was conspiring to diminish the presence of dissenting views?

Just wondering when the "free and open" Internet you supposedly support stops trying to chase off people you don't like because it's wrongthink. Crying about open Internet while censoring people you disagree with is the epitome of hypocrisy, and you're literally the CEO of that hypocrisy.
$C: Fuck off, you lost, get over it. The American internet will NEVER be censored by the government!!!
$C: Stop spreading propaganda. Keep the internet free from Government. I'm glad this happened!
$C: Fuck Obama!
$C: Omg guys! My internet is still the same as it ever was!!! 
$C: Actually the Internet was just fine *before* so-called "net neutrality" -- which is NOT neutral.  Just like the so-called "Affordable Care Act" was NOT affordable. And "Antifa" does NOT mean Anti-Fascist. And "Planned Parenthood" does NOT help you plan for parenthood.

$C: >update2 (9:55AM pst): While the vote has not technically happened, we decided to post after the two dissenting commissioners released their statements. However, the actual vote appears to be delayed for security reasons. We hope everyone is safe.

$C: Well, fuck.
$C: I think the adjective should be predictable
$C: Could you fight the Nazis, too?
$C: Why aren't we all organizing to cut our internet off?  Do we care that little?

$C: I feel so bad for you spez after selling out reddit for 2.8mil
$C: Ajit Pai can eat a rectal skin tag
$C: Hey.. well, there was nothing in the existing net neutrality rules that stopped providers from throttling speeds, blocking content, or creating fast lanes?

https://techliberation.com/2017/07/12/heres-why-the-obama-fcc-internet-regulations-dont-protect-net-neutrality/

    The 2016 court decision upholding the rules was a Pyrrhic victory for the net neutrality movement. In short, the decision revealed that the 2015 Open Internet Order provides no meaningful net neutrality protections–it allows ISPs to block and throttle content. As the judges who upheld the Order said, “The Order…specifies that an ISP remains ‘free to offer ‘edited’ services’ without becoming subject to the rule’s requirements.”

https://www.forbes.com/sites/washingtonbytes/2017/05/15/can-isps-simply-opt-out-of-net-neutrality/

    But the DC Circuit suggests that a walled garden is fine as long as the provider “mak[es it] sufficiently clear to potential customers that if provides a filtered services involving the ISP’s exercise of ‘editorial intervention.’”

Court document here,

https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/06F8BFD079A89E13852581130053C3F8/$file/15-1063-1673357.pdf

So what happens now? I mean, what actually happens, not sky is falling nonsense.  

If you're worried about content being censored or otherwise shaped that you want to see, I have news for you about a "user-driven" community shaping what you see right now. 
$C: We? Speak for yourself. And go away with this propaganda.
$C: And today, on Episode 294 of "Elections Have Consequences..."

*bUt HEr emAIlS*
$C: Spez is worried about ISP's being able to censor content ? LOL
$C: How this must be fixed:

1) In the short term- legislation to enshrine an open internet as enforceable law, appoint an independent oversight body with teeth to keep the internet open

2) Recognize the internet was built with public taxpayer money and return it to the taxpayers. 

The internet must be nationalized. We built it, we own it. Allow providers to administer it at cost with a respectable, yet minimal profit margin.
$C: To u/arabscarab -

Net neutrality is obviously worth fighting for, but some people needlessly experienced death threats over the issue. How do we prevent such incidents from happening in the future fight for net neutrality? Also, how can we prevent hysteria in some people?

I’m asking this as someone who suffers from chronic anxiety, and the issue has not been kind to my mental health. I didn’t threaten anyone, nor am I planning on threatening anyone, but I don’t want to go hysterical over this issue.
$C: is there any way to pirate the internet?  just stop paying all our isp?
$C: We just lost.

Fuck me.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Trump's mission to turn the internet into his very own Nazi/White Supremacist propaganda page is complete
$C: All these posts with links to websites that are fighting for net neutrality...

These will be useful when ISPs decide which websites to block from all their plans.
$C: Love u/spez
$C: Which one of you put in the bomb threat?
$C: Even though it's being fought for in court, how long until I have to start paying for social media and Netflix? What's the buffer time?
$C: I thought it was kind of weird how the admins were so quiet leading up to the protests last week...
$C: Just shut up and get to the vote please
$C: we fucked

$C: TIME TO FUCK SHIT UUUP!!!
$C: Get out your wallets boys
$C: Do you want to reverse this decision? It is very simple - vote in 2018, and in every opportunity in between.
$C: This is absolutely infuriating. This *needs* to be struck down immediately. They can't get away with this.
$C: R.I.P.
$C: The vote today is over. It is repealed. Everyone, OUR fight is not over. Vote. Write to them. We can still win this in the long run. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Hopefully this will lead to the ISPs throttling the shit out of alt-right media spaces (brietbart, etc) so they can't make any money off ads and videos. Give them a taste of their own shitty "free market" medicine.
$C: What are you going to do, make a second graphic on reddit load slow?

$C: The most jarring thing for me was the rhetoric on both sides - on the "keep" side we had such typical liberal gems as "wrong side of history" and other pandering nonsense weakening the rhetoric for NN, and on the "repeal" side we had Mr. Fuck-Me-In-The-Ass-Please-Free-Market patronize the fears (both legitimate and those founded by propaganda) right to our livestreamed faces. 

It's not the absolute end of the internet, so let's remember to not overreact either, because that's what makes (((us))) look bad; what this is is just another step to screw us that we had no practical control over. That's the most upsetting part to me.
$C: This shit isn't over!!!
$C: So when are we going to have Reddit Neutrality?
$C: Thanks for taking a firm stance in this matter. Content providers stand to lose as much as the regular Internet consumer and user.

The time for being wiped under the taint of the ISPs ends today.
$C: > organic takeovers

Sure, bud.
$C: Everybody. Let’s get the pitchforks ready. 
$C: I paid for unlimited Data since before this 2015 regulation.

How is this effecting me?
$C: I am starting a petition to get Danny Masterson reinstated on The Ranch. if you sign it, net neutrality will be saved.
$C: Shit Pie’s house needs to be surrounded by protesters 24/7, chanting and playing loud music in the middle of the night. 

The steaming pile of shit and his family should never be allowed to live a normal life after this.
$C: reddit users 2016: both sides are the same write in Bernie

spez 2016: we must preserve the valuable conversations on /r/the_donald. 

spez and reddit users 2017: why are bad things happening in politics 
$C: Gotta love that bullshit "security theater" - someone handing Pai a note, then announcing he has to "take a break" and the room is searched by police dogs https://www.politico.com/livestream-watch-live-politico-streaming_1_1.  

They've framed the scene it to make it look as if they're being threatened by liberal-commie-terrorists, as if somehow there was a reasonable expectation that a credible threat existed.  Expect this to be all over the Hannity and Levin broadcasts.

Guys, if there is a credible threat warranting evacuation and bomb sniffing dogs, **you would have just cut the feed and searched the room.**

Edit:  See the link - someone handed Pai a note, then the room was calmly emptied, then a search.  Politico's feed remained up.  Nobody looked anxious or rushed.  Security theater.
$C: I wish there was a way to block this NN spam.
$C: The battle may have been lost put the war shall continue!
$C: Like honestly when are people going to wake up and realize that the system is broken and can not be fixed except for the violent overthrow of the oligarchy of business and lobbyists who control what happens in America despite millions in opposition 
$C: I remember back in the dark days before net neutrality. Back pre 2015 the internet was a wasteland. Decent memes were hard to come by and dank memes almost non existent.... Millions will die because of this decision.
$C: F
$C: F
$C: MAGA!!! one bad obama regulation at a time!!!! amirite guyzzz???
$C: If you are tired of the kind of corruption that we are seeing in Ajit Pai and his two buddies, then start voting for representatives in Congress who are strongly committed to effective corruption reform... As in a central piece of their platform, not just token lip service.

*Corruption has become the primary threat to the long term health of our democracy.*

We need to fix our constitution to blunt the outsized power of money in our government.  But to do that, we need to have a majority of representatives in office who are committed to resisting and fixing the influence of money.  

Ultimately, we as a society need to become committed to corruption reform as a central political value of our nation.  **Intolerance of corruption needs to be part of our very identity as Americans.**  This must become one of our prime values as citizens, right alongside liberty, opportunity, and the fundamental rights that we hold dear.  While the need to put down corruption is especially vital today, it is a struggle that we will always face.

It's time for We The People to get fed up and "drain the swamp" ourselves.  Get out there and vote.  **Vote first against corruption.**  Forget party lines if you have to.  Once we get ammendments that blunt the impact of big money built into the Constitution, and Congress begins listening to the people again, then we can go back to worrying about our party-line concerns and get all the practical problems fixed too.  Then we will be able to leave to our children and grandchildren a nation that we are proud of -- a nation that will look after them properly.

You are only truly powerless if you refuse to vote.
 Take up your voting powers and vote out the corruption.  
$C: Organic takeovers?

It's proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that all those posts made to state subreddits were by shills, and all the upvotes were artificial as well.

Just look at the post in Maine or any others. A dead account comes back to life, makes one post and comment, gets 50k upvotes in a very short amount of time in a very low traffic subreddit, then disappeared.

About as organic as a shiny metal ass.
$C: The quality of r/all has taken a dive since that red picture paid to take over the site.

How many unique users did that stunt end up costing?
$C: Ajit Pai: I'm gonna make everyone pay for the internet..
me: whatchu gonna gain from it?

Still wondering how he thinks that he has the rights to do shit like this? 
Cause people already are paying electricity, for water, for WIFI/internet, rent..

What could be next? Paying for breathing fresh air?
$C: Press F To Pay Respects
$C: Yeah can someone give me an unbiased description as to why The_Donald believes repealing NN is a good thing?

I seriously would like to know, thanks!
$C: I'm just throwing this hypothetical out there.......

But at what point does physical removal from a position become warranted? I feel like at this point, we've done enough talking, there's been enough dissent and talk, and the only thing that will actually accomplish anything would be to physically remove these ass hats from their positions and bar them from coming back..... So few, should not have so much power over so many.... And they have shown time and time again that they give 0 fucks about the masses opinions.
$C: Hahahaha I hope they throttle this alt-right shit hole right out of existence

never forget spez, your platform is the #1 recruitment tool of white supremacists today

$C: 2020, elect democrats to make the internet a Utility. 
$C: Well can anyone tell me what effect this now has (I live outside US but I also hate pai or whatever his name is)
$C: Ya'll motherfuckers should've voted for Hillary.
$C: Ok.

u/spez How much monetarily has reddit dedicated to electing congressional candidates who will provide NN legislation?

Otherwise this kind of post is just superficial pandering to user experience on your site. No amount of letter writing or calling will get a law passed if Republicans and Anti-NN democrats control congress.
$C: Was this the most astroturfed / shilled campaign you guys ever pulled off?
$C: u/spez I applaud the efforts made by the community to make sure all voices are heard. Having said that, we all know that Reddit it self censors a certain community that follow the President, speaking frankly here, how can we be for freedom of the internet if you censor subs?? really, shouldnt you allow all voice to be equal?? its kind of a hypocritical statement to ask us to call our congressman while you censor voices. while i dont agree with their views, i would fight for their right to express them.


$C: Fuck you, spez.
$C: Uhuh. Good luck with that, when Reddit is a close second to Ajit Pai's throttling. r/worldnews treats it as a U.S. internal issue and r/news removed links to the live *news*feeds, and what was essentially a Reddit Live shoved into the people's mouth from a pro-Catalunya secession brigade was nowhere to be found when the chance came to provide publicity to the FCC Reddit Live thread. Meanwhile, I keep seeing more and more automatic removal of comments critical of what Ajit Pai has done.

You know what? You defend it, bud. All on you.
$C: I watched the Matrix late last night.  Wasn't even thinking about this.

Is this reality?

$C: Man, fuck this Drumpfler nation. This vote is terrible - it's almost as bad as when Luke dies and Kylo Ren kills Snoke. 
$C: Lol
$C: [oops](https://pastebin.com/vJ9a3hT2)
$C: What worries me is that net neutrality will be used for ideological ends. For example, loading Fox News takes 1 second, loading Washington Post takes 2 minutes. How many people will just choose to read Fox News because it's fast, because they can't wait 2 minutes to read the Post? What if the Post is forced to remove ad space to make their site load quicker, which costs them revenue and undercuts their mission?

What we can do, whether or not we can change the law, is make a personal promise to ourselves that we will not let them use our own impatience and short attention spans to control our access to the media. We have to promise to support good journalism and free media, even if it involves slower loading speeds and frustration.  Most of us don't have much self control when it comes to the internet. We see a link we like, we click it. We can make the easy choice because there's no downside. Well, there could be a downside, now, so we have to be grown-ups who stick by our principles.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Do none of you people question why giant corporations want you to defend net neutrality by saying giant corporations don't want it?
$C: I'm sorry but this is a gross manipulation of public opinion on this matter. It is highly unlikely that how someone uses the internet is going to change for the average user, the incredible repudiation of the Title 2 designation of Net Neutrality is driven by nothing but fear mongers who suggest that the worst case scenario is the inevitable outcome.

ISPs are businesses and like any business, their number one concern is keeping their customers happy, i don't expect a company like Comcast or Verizon to slow down or block anyone, such an action would be gross violation of trust and would inevitably cost those companies business. I used to believe that Net Neutrality was of the utmost importantance just like everyone else, but then i realized that it is simply yet another unnecessary regulation which hinders ISPs from being innovative with their technology. Net Neutrality has always existed, it was only called into question when a market giant such as Netflix started to eat up all of the bandwidth by themselves.

Regulations are the government's way to inject themselves into a free market industry and take control of it to some degree, like them or hate them, ISPs have a gun to their head and it stifles their ability to conduct business. As a user, put out any notion in your mind that this will effect you negatively in any way, the argument against this repeal is being planted in your mind to rile you up about the consequences of Repealing Net Neutrality on title 2. This repeal isn't being done to make you pay more or to limit your service, this repealing is taking place primarily to allow ISPs to handle traffic differently for services which utilize an inordinate amount of data as part of their business model.
$C: I hope you stick to your guns like youve been doing Reddit because "needless" shit like this site is the first internet package Im dropping to save my ever dwindling money once my internet gets chopped up into cable TV packages.
$C: I will laugh my ass off when a provider comes around to offer what Net Neutrality provides and run the bigger corporations out of business, because free market. You must give the consumer what it wants, or lose the consumer to someone else who will.
$C: I for one am glad the government has gotten their grubby fingers out of one more business. 
$C: rekt
$C: Time to bomb the fuck out of some fcc offices you cheap dumb pricks 
$C: Haha, get fucked retards ~
$C: You are supporting net neutrality because it will save you money, not because it will save us money and you know it.
$C: Needs more frying
$C: If you really want net neutrality you will get govt out of the internet game completely.
$C: Yes because the communist revolution must go forward
$C: Poon tang Pai.
$C: We didn't do it reddit!!! xD
$C: Rather than focusing (so ignorantly) on internet-as-a-utility, we could make like intelligent people and find solutions that accomplish the same benefits without settling for hamfisted ones. Just a radical thought for consideration.
$C: SPEZ WITH THE CLUTCH RED POST BABY
$C: Hate to bring the left vs right argument into this, but vote Democrat in the next election and hopefully we won’t have to deal with this shit anymore. 
$C: So /u/spez and /u/kn0thing - I should care about net neutrality so Reddit can continue to operate with an extremely biased agenda of its own?

Why do you keep pretending to be some savior of free speech when there's objective fucking proof in how you operate Reddit that reveals an extremely political angle you push when you can? I'm not even talking about T_D or anything. How about you explain why subs like /r/guns are blacklisted from /r/popular even though it meets zero of the qualifications for blacklisting?

We know why. I just want to hear you say it.
$C: But:
The 2016 court decision upholding the rules was a Pyrrhic victory for the net neutrality movement. In short, the decision revealed that the 2015 Open Internet Order provides no meaningful net neutrality protections–it allows ISPs to block and throttle content. As the judges who upheld the Order said, “The Order…specifies that an ISP remains ‘free to offer ‘edited’ services’ without becoming subject to the rule’s requirements.”

TL;DR: Nothing in previous rules prevented ISPs from throttling or blocking content. Just like before 2015.
$C: Fuck u/spez
$C: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
$C: Ajit Pai must die
$C: Have content providers (reddit, Netflix, etc) ever considered blocking ISP's that don't support Net Neutrality?  I realize what that means...less traffic on your sites and less customers.  But if there was a unified front on that, if these ISP's customers have no accessible content on their service they provide....maybe subscribers will either move to a friendlier ISP or call to cancel?  I just feel like Google, Netflix, Reddit...they all have the true leverage but don't use it because of the risk involved (cutting off your users).


But imagine the impact if Amazon, Google, Netflix, Facebook, Instagram...all of them blocked Comcast users? Can you imagine the outcry? 
$C: Here's how Bernie can still win.
$C: Guys before the FCC take away the internet **please** help me decide on a reddit username!

u/solozilyana

or 

u/AncientWyvernShield

Idk which to choose! 

edit: sorry to plug this here but everywhere else I try i get no feedback. Thankfully my representatives stand with us on this issue and will be fighting for us!
$C: The support for Net Neutrality is coming from big businesses and big websites, like Reddit, that want to keep the playing field stacked in their favor. Repeal of Net Neutrality may result in traffic providers charging websites that use a large amount of traffic, like Reddit, to pay more. 

Those who use more traffic should pay more. This is a classic example of the rich not wanting to pay their fair share. Don't fight a battle for large and wealthy internet companies. Let's repeal Net Neutrality. 

Net Neutrality didn't exist until 2015, and all the Apocalyptic things they try to scare people with, weren't happening. Consumers were well-protected then by three powerful federal laws: the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, plus other laws too. We will be well-protected again after today. 
$C: Literally fell into a depression now.  I'm tired of this SHIT
$C: Hey Spez, if you're against throttling, then why do you throttle subreddits you don't like?


$C: This anti-net neutrality crap is bullshit. Why can’t Ajit Pai keep the money he has and not be a greedy asshole?
$C: Reddit's free ride on the NN train are coming to an end! Sweet Jesus Hallelujah! Its time large corporations like Reddit pay ISPs for bringing them millions of customers instead of charging customers for the privilege to kiss /u/spez rear end.
$C: RIP freedom of speech.
$C: Its over, deal with it
$C: Wonder if Pai's phone number is publicly available
$C: Fuck you spez
$C: Giant. Waste. Of. Time.


$C: Eat shit Spez you censoring cuck. Now **you** could be the one censored if you don't play nice. LMAO nice propaganda
$C: Lol, I'm so happy it got repealed. Reddit BTFO
$C: [Cry Some More] (https://media.tenor.com/images/0c5be5ee3a3947c85b744a72efce48c0/tenor.gif)
$C: We need to throw the bums out in the next election
$C: #If Spez doesn't like it, it must be good.

GAS
$C: > I wanted to take the time to thank redditors for your incredible activism on this issue

Your activism wasn't enough! You let slacktivism get in the way! You let the media  DISTRACT you! You guys were supposed to physically go to his location and REMOVE him, hold him hostage, I don't care.  Now you guys are going to bend over backwards and let the government RAPE you as much as they want!  

Enjoy your new internet, because the government knows you won't be able to do a damn fucking thing about it.  Good job dip shits! 
$C: Top comments are all bots and shills.

This is what Reddit has become.
$C: Best news all year, and just in time for Christmas. Wonderful!
$C: From Pai's statement: "But they don’t have to. If our rules deter the massive infrastructure investment that we need, eventually we’ll pay the price in terms of less innovation."

Im confused, how does net neutrality and Title II restrict smaller companies from making investments in their networks/products?
He also says that companies hold back because they "...cannot afford to deal with a potential complaint and enforcement action.” How does the government enforce anything to delay their production under Title II?
$C: I find it ironic that spez, who loves censoring and closing subreddits for wrong think, now wants the community's help to find NN. 
$C: What was the internet like before 2015?

I don't remember any if these fees being in place then. 

I do remember protesting ISPs on internet slowdown day in 2014 and blackout day in 2012 that made the internet better however 
$C: Looks like the internet is still working to me.
$C: Government did something right. Time for reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeedit to activate autism.
$C: At the end of the day, the thing I want to know most is just how fucking much did they pay Ajit to give the finger to pretty much the entire United States.
$C: A few hours ago i felt bad for this Ajit Pai guy because he was memefied and bullied online, but rn... fuck this piece of human garbage. 

All i have to say is thank god i live in norway
$C: It's a damn, damn shame Pai couldn't have settled for driving a cab or selling Slurpees. 
$C: Hah, stop censoring the_donald you hypocrites.
$C: The only two with brains were the women. Hand the FCC to those two women instead of that joke of a man. Either that or disband the FCC.
$C: Okay Reddit, what about my voice? I agree with their decision. 
$C: Unpopular opinion: EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE
$C: Internet shouldn't be free
$C: Thank you for fighting for the future of the free internet. It's so great that you're on the good side. 
$C: I can't believe this is happening. Freedom is ebbing away every day.
$C: Actually, no, I support the vote. So bug off
$C: fuck u/spez
$C: Is everyone here taking crazy pills?  What was reversed was Obama's "net neutrality" which introduced censorship all over the place.  If that's what you want, then go the fuck to California.  They're fucked up backwards there.
$C: How do I remove this from my damn feed? Didn't want it last time, definitely don't want it this time.
$C: Oh the horror! Now we have to resort back to exactly how the Internet was before Net Neutrality......TWO years ago! 😩😩🤦‍♂️
$C: The fact that any UNELECTED Bureaucrat can make any decision of that magnitude, that affects that many people, is ridiculous. The fact that the Houses of Representatives and the Executive branch allow and permit this kind of governance from people never elected to anything by the people themselves, only magnifies the total disconnect between the governed and the Political class. Letting favored corporate interests have their way, against the people, time and time again, is the sign of a Banana Republic.
$C: For those wanting to share a big red pill to your liberal friends.

What if I told you there was nothing in the existing net neutrality rules that stopped providers from throttling speeds, blocking content, or creating fast lanes?

$C: I hope we vote the orange idiot out of office next election of he doesn't get impeached and imprisoned first.
$C: But what about online censorship? Specifically conservative voices on platform such as YouTube, Facebook, and Reddit.
$C: Fuck you, Spez. Go censor more right winged content. I hope the whole internet goes down the shitter.
$C: [deleted]
$C: No shills in this thread. Nope.
$C: Stop arguing for internet socialism
$C: Bunch of babies here threatening violence and revolt over net neutrality. There was so much hype about this that people actually the world is coming to an end.

You do realize that the folks at the FCC are not there forever, right? 

The next group can reinstate net neutrality.

It’s called politics. You win some and you lose some.

Bush got his way, then Obama got his way, now Trump is getting his way. 

Voting changes things. Voting, not violence.
$C: You didn’t believe in a free and open internet when you edited user comments. What made you change your mind?
$C: FUCK THE FCC
$C: I'm surprised anon hasn't posted this guy's address asking someone to go tune him up a little.  Big teeth bastard
$C: So what about Reddit neutrality? Are we going to see you guys stop artificially hiding certain wrong-think subreddits from the front page because it hurts the sensibilities of your preferred political classes, or is that out of the question? You're hypocrites, lads.
$C: The government has no business regulating the internet.  I'm happy to see net neutrality go away.
$C: How could the fcc be so stupid 
$C: it's just the fucking internet you spergs
$C: Boo hoo 
$C: Even after you guys pushed all those fake "my senator" posts to the front page? Wow, you must feel so stupid.
$C: Fuck /u/spez  
$C: Bye bye net neutrality  🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻
$C: Net neutrality has been there only for 2 years, I don't remember any stories from before 2015 about ISP blocking users or any of the horrors portrayed here.

Can anyone explain what are you so afraid of? Porn sites and Netflix having to pay for bandwidth?
$C: Who put my name in the comments for NN? Because I sure the fuck didn’t.     Liberals are a bunch of assfucking scammers and lazy niggers.  
$C: Yeah we got to fight for the little guys ....like Netflix and Google..... you know the real underdogs.... so much ignorance...
$C: top kek
$C: Fuck you, /u/Spez. You're doing it all wrong.
$C: you're full of shit spez. what the fuck have you done about anything, ever? you suck the dicks of the mods over in the_donald and don't do shit else. fuck off. we'll do this without you.
$C: We should ban t_D since they hate net neutrality so much.
$C: Funny that how the very same companies that threaten to murder the internet in its sleep (Twitter, Facebook, Reddit) through censorship and fuckery are now all about *"saving it"* while footing you the bill for the bandwidth they'll pay at the same rate you do, despite consuming trillions times more than you ever will in a single lifetime
$C: This is arguably the biggest civil rights victory since 1964. 
$C: Was supporting net neutrality included in the $2.8 million you got for selling /r/politics?
$C: [deleted]
$C: This is so unfair. Next it's going to be the power company. We're going to have to pay monthly to keep our lights on but if you want to charge your phone that's extra. 
$C: Wouldn't be surprised if some people end up being murdered.
$C: Wait, how can we still access Reddit?

I was told by a gigantic animalistic horde that "THE INTERNET IS BEING STOLEN FROM US"

Yet here we are, on the internet. 
$C: Guys these are the companies that don't pay taxes! These are the companies that take away rights don't follow the law! The politicians that get in power get that way because they are bought out. They charge us for water and find legal loopholes to make us a slave class who pay taxes that they use for themselves. 
$C: You can write and whine all you want. It has shown the people have no power. Only thing to save us is the court system. Stop with these damn posts
$C: Time to leave folks.  Trump's people are setting the stage for a coup.  Trump himself is too stupid, but that seems to be the goal.  So unless you are willing to fight, and I mean pick up a gun and fight, it's time to think about fleeing.  Good luck.
$C: Americans are fucking useless aren't they. 
$C: net neutrality is the one thing I agree with idiot liberals on... 
$C: Didn't you vote for Donald /u/spez? Serves you right
$C: Bahahahahahahahahahahaha FUCK YES. MUH GUBMENT REGULATION IS GONE, derrppppppppp durrr
$C: Calling R/conspiracy... the vote hasn’t happened yet
$C: [deleted]
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves. Violence was part of equal rights for Race and Gender. Violence stopped the Nazis and saved millions of lives. Violence created our Country and maintained it. It is a tool and in some situations it is the best tool for the job. This is one of those situations because all other avenues have been exhausted and the powers of the government themselves are being abused So there it is. There is the solution.     

I know you all won't listen and I know we will lose the internet because of it. I hope your ego and pretentious morality was worth us losing one the greatest wonders of the human world. My resentment is no longer just for the corrupt human garbage that pushed against Net Neutrality, but also now for all of you who allowed it to happen just because you didn't want to get dirty to clean up the filth.    

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: You guys, I just posted a comment on reddit without being charged $.25

$C: Reddit never truly supported net neutrality take a look at r/lounge fuck you spez
$C: u/arabscarab -- why do Reddit, in the light of their commitments to Net Neutrality, not enforce neutrality policies within their own platform? There is documented evidence of Reddit using algorithmic restrictions on certain major subreddits to suppress their community from reaching the front page.

$C: How is America considered a first world country?
$C: Am I the only one that doesn't want the government to have total control over the ISP's, and instead move towards a freer market by letting the the ISP's decide what to do?
$C: Woo! I'm glad it lost. Reddit is imploding as expected and it's hilarious!
$C: [deleted]
$C: What if I told you everything's going to be just fuckin fine?
$C: This is the only thing I disagree with that trump has done
$C: So I'm going to suggest that maybe... just maybe, you stop hosting one of the largest online groups against net neutrality who constantly skirts your rules, undermines your infrastructure, and actively seeks to harm your company.  T_hey don't value the first amendment, nor the principles that reddit was initially founded on and by allowing them their nest all you are doing is hurting yourselves.  Just saying. 
$C: Spez wrote this? Damn, guess I'm with the FCC now
$C: Won't work.

America spoke when they voted for Trump and stated that Net Neutrality is not important.

If you voted for Trump or didn't vote for Clinton, no matter how you felt about her, you are to blame.

Don't give me this "Blame the 2 party system" shit either.

Either fix the system, or work within it to do what you can.

You did this to yourself America, and I hope you enjoy it.

***Edit***

Keep the downvotes coming.

I am quite done giving a fuck what you do-nothing assholes think about anything.

You sit on your keyboards and piss & moan while people you do not like take over the world and purchase your data and your rights to increase their power and wealth.

You refuse to do what it takes to make a stand.

Think about it, Net neutrality is dead, period.

And here you are, sending data across the wires they now own and will make billions off of, because you *think* you cannot disconnect, you are convinved you cannot live life without the Internet and you are unwilling to deal with a little inconvenience or even a major one to win your battles.

This is why terrorists win, they are *all* willing to die for their cause, while we are not even willing to give up our fucking web browsing.
$C: Net Neutrality was repealed and I can still view Reddit?  But I was told I would have to pay money to my ISP now to view Reddit.  You mean I was being lied to? 
$C: We can still fight, we are reddit, we can do anything.

$C: The sad part is his view of open internet is saying companies choose to censor stuff. Which I believe might stick to 1st amendment rights and the rights of business owner to refuse service to anyone. Also signing up for these accounts come with terms and conditions that let everything he said happen because if you don't accept you don't join the social media site.

This repeal doesn't change that just makes it so ISPs can basically go I don't like Twitter rip your bandwidth.
$C: Muh Freedom! Muh Democracy!
$C: still fuck spez
$C: What comes next.  Everyone will
Have a little slower service.   You then
Will have to pay for faster speeds 
 So your bill now $130.  It should
Bump up to $145 
$C: We are going to being paying for individual websites just like we were in 2015. Oh, wait...
$C: Update: if you're for NN, chances are you have no idea what the fuck you're protesting against. 

By all means, feel free to educate me ;)
$C: Fuck you, /u/spez
$C: Lol you noobs there is nothing we can do to stop this. Your letters.. your calls they will do nothing 
$C: Not in america, not my problem
$C: fuck you /u/spez

Why don't you practice what you preach?

You are a proven hypocrite.
$C: Get fucked you communists
$C: With all the censoring you (spez) do, it’s hilarious watching you try to white knight this situation.  How will we carry on without the “protections,” of NN that have been in existence for all of 3 years?  Oh, the horror.
$C: Hahah fuck liberals and net neutrality 
$C: THANK YOU FCC!!! YOU'VE RETURNED POWER TO THE PEOPLE!!!!
$C: What's unfortunate is that I don't see anyone talking about the other side of this discussion. The goal of this administration is to remove regulations and bureaucratic red tape, period. And it's killing policies from both sides of the aisle, not merely constricted to traditional partisan boundaries. So why am I saying this? Well...

The point of removing burdensome and unnecessary policies in the first place is simple. Just follow the money. Take a look at the savings net from abolishing just one policy, and you might just change your mind. Remember that these are YOUR tax dollars being saved, and killing the overwhelmingly expensive laws actually makes for a more efficient overhaul to our taxation system.

So no, I will not try to convince anyone that Net Neutrality is good or bad. I simply want to share a lesser known point-of-view when examining this issue objectively, rather than through the bias of the left and right. I surely hope this post doesn't upset anyone, and I would be more than happy to discuss this with any of you further, so long as it remains civil and mutually respectful.

$C: the_donald says NN is bad and that nothing will change. i dont know what to believe anymore

$C: I would be on your side in the past but after the amount of BS that Reddit and the rest of Silicon valley pulled in the last election, I kind of just want to see their salt flow.
$C: With all your talk about net neutrality, how do you feel that you aided and abetted the election of the people who are doing it? How do you fit that square peg into a round hole?
$C: Land of the free guys! Land of the free.
$C: Mr. Spez are you worried, sir?
$C: Remember in 2016 when the TPP was atop reddit all the time? Trump killed it and while he's a shitty guy, he shut that shit down fast. 



$C: Ya lets all just lament and let some piece of shit earn millions of dollars.

God forbid we take action not just write a letter.
$C: Just according to keikaku.
$C: Where is the rest of the home page? Why do you keep manipulating home page results? 
$C: Serious question that I'm hoping to get an answer to. How are these political "organic takeovers" any different than what the people at the_donald were doing last year?
$C: I'm not that disappointed now. I was disappointed when it actually happened, which was when Pai got the job. It was a done deal at that point. A Republican majority in the commission? The end.
$C: The US is no better than any other nation with a tyrannical government.

Enough of this "democracy" farce. We don't have one. There is no rule by people or a republic that has representatives that answer to the people.

At no time has that been more obvious than Net Neutrality. They've always passed the buck pretending people don't care and don't get involved and we don't make our voice heard.

Well we did all that, and it's obvious we did, and we were still ignored and shut down.

Also never believe politicians when they just blame the other party and insist they can't do anything. Look it's been true for a long time, when they want to do something they just do it. When they don't want to do something, because it might actually be a benefit to the general public, they make excuse after excuse and drag their feet and play politics, hoping you'll either forget or just blame someone else.

This is the real reason most people don't vote and just give up. It's something you figure out as you get older. It's what Thomas Jefferson said himself and what all the Founding Fathers write about. It was obvious this would happen and has been that way for a long time.

$C: So does this mean net neutrality was killed today?

$C: lol what vote?
$C: Well, I was going to quote /u/spez a few times, showing how they're really not for neutrality, but their profile isn't accessible

Weird
$C: Who the fuck is Alexis?
$C: What do businesses rationalize their decisions around?


If companies such as Comcast (Reddit hates them) supports Net Neutrality, is there something we aren't asking ourselves? 


Hint: Companies don't make decisions based on goodwill.
$C: wait they didnt vote yet right?
$C: I will be honest. I am not very informed on this, although with what I do know I don't see how repealing it would do anyone any good..?
$C: [deleted]
$C: They were just called to recess per security advisement.
$C: If the vote passes and neutrality is abolished, is there anything reddit can do to stop companies from making people pay to get on reddit or stop it from being slowed? Some kind of legal policy to tell companies to bug off? Or will even reddit be at the mercy of this?
$C: >t. brainlet
$C: Maybe it would be better to have a global organisation that regulates this stuff. So that one country can't just opt out.
$C: So if we gotta pay now

$C: lol it's over
$C: It's over...we lost
$C: Pass a law you dumbasses. 
$C: If only we voted and called our congressmen, this wouldn't have happened! /s 
$C: Trump voters are the gift that keeps on giving. Thanks guys.
$C: Well done right wing Americans, you keep fucking up your country. To be honest though I do enjoy watching it. When Trump won something changed in my head, I went from being worried for America and Americans to “this is going to be hilarious”. I have a pitch black sense of humour and enjoy watching people suffer from their own mistakes, I like seeing people hung from rope they were given and told to set up. 
$C: I can't understand, is this repeal everywhere or just in the US?
$C: update2 (9:55AM pst): While the vote has not technically happened, we decided to post after the two dissenting commissioners released their statements. However, the actual vote appears to be delayed for security reasons. We hope everyone is safe.

You hope everyone is safe? Is everyone standing in front of a tank or something? 
$C: I guess I'm confused.  Screw the FCC.  Shouldn't "we" collectively just start a "new internet"?
$C: Funny when a piece of shit like spez talks about fighting censorship. What a hypocrite. 
$C: A potential positive....this could be the end of the Trump administrations power. 
If telecom companies go to the extreme and set up tiered plans for certain sites it will destroy any Republican attempts to take power going forward...for at least a while.

Trump will lose in a landslide in 2020. 

People are dumb enough to think their $200 cookie (tax cut) is worth getting screwed over....but you fuck with their porn???? You're done.
$C: Congrats on the payday Mr. Pai
$C: han solo dies
$C: transparency means i wont b band @ reddit :DDD

-some reddit idiots
$C: I mean: The good news is that the FCC even stripped their ability to make legislation about the internet. So thats good I guess.
$C: Why has reddit not gone dark like you did with the far less dangerous bill of CISPA? 

/u/sez 

$C: Down with net neutrality.  Obligatory spez is a youknowwhat.
$C: Americans rights stripped away by a horse mouthed Indian

$C: It makes me sick to my stomach that stuffy old  men in overpriced suits think they know what's best for the majority of people. And what makes me feel even sicker is that only a small percentage of those people seem to care that this is the case. Planet full of brain dead idiots. 
$C: u/powerbottomharry
$C: When you *were* a Trump Supporter and thought it was good that the republicans held all three key pieces of government, but you’re a supporter of Net Neutrality.

Fuck 
$C: I mean, Reddit went crazy over this matter and still nothing has changed. In the end one person wins against a bunch. What a nice thing /s.
$C: Is there anything non-US people can do? It's insane that this is happening and yet the international community seems at a loss to help. All the links and appeals that I see daily and wish to help with *daily* are solely aimed at US citizens. While I understand that this is US based and yadda yadda yadda... it's a disgrace. If there is a way that I and the others can help *US* not be so helpless, I think we gladly would

$C: Put a bounty on his head.
$C: YAY woooot weeeeeeee GO FCC
$C: spez is just mad that with this regulation removal. his site is now prone to criminal investigations. fuckin lolz, have fun spez with your anti-1a lawsuits. 
$C: When calling everyone that isn't far left a homophobe, racist or sexist for 10 years finally backfires and America elects a narcissist into office and no one cares about the internet anymore except for people who use it as a platform to talk about how victimized they are.

Yeah I'm ready to go back outside... Nice work. 
$C: Okay, I'll start by saying that I support this repeal. That may be enough to downvote me for some of you but hopefully others will hear me out. Besides the ISPs themselves, everyone wants lower prices and more choices for internet service. We all want access to the whole internet with no throttling or censorship. That's the goal. And while I think the repeal is a good first step, I'm not happy with the status quo. We need to start talking about right-of-way reform. Right now, big ISPs buy influence in municipalities to gain exclusive rights to certain areas and push out potential new competition. Public right-of-ways were intended to preserve land for use by various companies to keep certain ones from monopolizing it. Instead, corporations (especially utilities like AT&T) just got in bed with local regulators to procure influence. They used and are using public space to limit your choice and the free market. So even if you'd prefer still having NN (and I totally understand that many people do), supporting right-of-way reform is key to fixing this mess. Whether NN exists as a regulation or not, we MUST take away these unfair advantages.

$C: Well, this sucks
$C: It is so sad that even a bomb threat cannot make people hear the voice of the people. I'm waiting for some riots or something.

$C: Nothing will change. 
$C: Oh well.. Where do I sign up for the meme war? 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Look what making phone calls or emails to senators did.  Nothing. 

We knew this would be done. We need to send an aggressive message to the FCC and the congressman who sold our people off to telecom companies. The telecom companies that bribed our politicians. 

We need to take action instead of sitting on our thumbs hoping for the best. Voting is too far off for many states. 

We are going no where with this. We need to take the streets and do some serious damage. Take action. Sending emails to politicians who we don't know is on our side is not taking action. 

The FCC has declared war on the American people. They have declared war on our rights and we the people have to defend it. 

THIS IS OUR COUNTRY. THIS COUNTRY IS FOR THE PEOPLE. NOT THE FATASSES IN THE 1%
$C: HAHAHAHAHAHHAH GET FUCKED 
$C: Net neutrality is a sham! Under the current law people are defending it is perfectly legal for ISP's to throttle your internet. Ever heard of comcast business? I hear ads on the radio for it everyday offering higher speeds for 'business' at a higher rate for higher speed! Not to mention Netflix now offers three different packages that dictate whether or not you can stream in HD! The standard package doesn't include HD streaming! If these two examples aren't proof that net neutrality is a sham Idk what is. Net neutrality is not really net neutrality, it was a giant power grab by the Obama administration in 2015. Deregulation of ISP's is good for everyone! Especially for people like me in rural areas that are stuck with shitty Internet. Net neutrality has killed investment in Internet infrastructure, removing it will result in faster internet for everyone!
$C: Uhhh, guys? I already feel my internet slowin' down. Can someone call the internet police? 
$C: Gonna start downloading all the good porn I can 
$C: I think we all need to calm down a little bit. Is this how the greatest country in the world is supposed to act? Throwing death threats and asking for murder hardly seems appropriate. 
$C: Every single top post is a paid shill. This website is a fucking disgrace.

Fuck /u/spez. You cannibal cunt.
$C: Unacceptable!(It really is acceptable, I just want to fit in here) To arms!(With my finest emojis and memes)Let's riot!(Let's project outrage in cyberspace because I'm bored)
$C: FTC Privacy Regulation, sec.177
Restoring FTC [Federal Trade Commission] jurisdiction over ISPs will enable the FTC to apply its extensive privacy and data security expertise to provide the uniform online privacy protections that consumers expect and deserve.651

 FCC release, p.83

1.	Many of the largest ISPs (Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, Cox, Frontier, etc.) have committed in this proceeding not to block or throttle legal content.507 These commitments can be enforced by the FTC under Section 5, protecting consumers without imposing public-utility regulation on ISPs.508


The FTC’s unfair-and-deceptive-practices authority “prohibits companies from selling consumers one product or service but providing them something different,” which makes voluntary commitments enforceable.502 The FTC also requires the “disclos[ur]e [of] material information if not disclosing it would mislead the consumer,” so if an ISP “failed to disclose blocking, throttling, or other practices that would matter to a reasonable consumer, the FTC’s deception authority would apply.”503

ISPs cannot conspire. (FCC invokes Sherman Act Antitrust Laws, Section 144, p.85, FCC release)
1.	Section 1 of the Sherman Act bars contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade, making anticompetitive arrangements illegal. If ISPs reached agreements to unfairly block, throttle, or discriminate against Internet conduct or applications, these agreements would be per seillegal under the antitrust laws.518


If an ISP that also sells video services degrades the speed or quality of competing “Over the Top” video services (such as Netflix),526 that conduct could be challenged as anticompetitive foreclosure.

176.We also reject AT&T’s assertion that the Commission should conditionally forbear from all Title II regulations as a preventive measure to address the contingency that a future Commission might seek to reinstate the Title II Order.647 Although AT&T explains that “conditional forbearance would provide an extra level of insurance against the contingency that a future, politically motivated Commission might try to reinstate a ‘common carrier’ classification [2015 Net Neutrality Regulations],”648 we see no need to address the complicated question of prophylactic forbearance and find such extraordinary measures [are] unnecessary.

Should the hypothetical harms that proponents of Title II imagine eventually come to pass, application of the antitrust laws would address those harms.

If customers have no alternative ISP and are forced to obey their one ISP's abusive policies, then the FTC can declare them a monopoly. 

-America has some of the shittiest internet in the world because our infrastructure is antiquated and fiber-optic trenching projects keep getting killed. Title-II strangles investments, but this repeal attracts it. Better infrastructure means faster speeds and cheaper service
-If ISPs collectively conspire to paywall a content-provider, they are subject to FTC anti-trust penetration.
-Regulatory oversight of the ISP now includes the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) as it was in the 1990's. Unlike the FCC, they can fuck Comcast for being a monopoly (which they are allowed to be if they're a utility).
-FCC is enforcing against throttling, censorship, restriction, etc. by invoking consumer protection and anti-trust laws (via FTC).
-Remember all the Congressmen who wanted to sell out our personal information earlier this year? This FCC repeal will block that, because of FTC consumer privacy protection regulations don't allow it.

The FCC couldn't have done any more for Open-Internet, thanks to Bill Clinton's judges in the D.C. Circuit strangling the shit out of the FCC's jurisdiction. They said "make the internet a utility or end Open-Internet". Instead of caving in to either of those demands, the FCC did a brilliant end-run around the judges by bringing the FTC in to do what the FCC no longer can. This will prevent blocking and throttling, and it'll be the first time they've attacked ISP monopolization (Comcast)! Unfortunately, the possibility still exists that paid-prioritization (bundling internet packages by speed) will emerge in the future, especially if the FTC fails to crack down on monopolies like Comcast, and/or if the markets fail to produce enough competitors to the existing ISPs.

$C: HELP
$C: While this is a very dark step in the world's history, since this will impact multiple other nations, there is a silver lining to this fuckshit.

It puts congress into a position to do something extraordinarily positive. They can work to make neutral internet a basic human right. Prior to this it seemed the winds could shift either way for the FCC to constantly attack net neutrality. Now we can solidify net neutrality into something that money and shills can't chip away at.

This also means the power is far more in the hands of the people than before.

It also means that companies should be doing exactly what Mr. Fellowkid (Assjizz Pai) would happen without a neutral internet. Working to expand their networks and offering more packages, and all the other bullshit that was touted as a smoke screen for the reality. We should expect that of ISPs now. We should demand they all do what he said they could do.

It should also serve as a warning to all citizens that our government agencies are fucking shady and should be held to the highest expectations. 
$C: will everyone now get cancer of the nads cause net neutrality reverted back to 2015?!?!?!?!
$C: LOL. The whole point of repealing net neutrality is to make it harder for the opposition to organize.

I wonder if that would make all the game companies make enough noise to help turn this around. 

We should still vote all of the paid off people out of office in 2018 and 2020, but there are also economic ways to fight this in addition to political. 
$C: As a European, is there any way to filter out all of this American net neutrality bullshit? I don't care.

Go out to buy your groceries. Pay cash. Buy dvd's, cd's again. Never revisit Amazon, eBay. Any part of the 'Site pays ISP, ISP makes site quicker' is off your radar. Don't use any site that loads quicker than others. Never click an advert online. (Nobody ever has) Install ad blockers.

It's not about blaming people/companies, it's about ensuring that those who pay to make your online experience worse see a drop in their revenues until they pressure the system to make your experience better again. 

Online games from small developers are screwed anyway, you want PvP you have to play a mega-release, and play within a soon to be regulated fast-zone if you want any success. So play offline. Set up the LAN's in the garage and get the friends over.

Switch banks, switch insurance, anything you can do to avoid online only services.

$C: Hey anyone here use the Internet before 2014? Well there was no executive order granting the FCC powers to regulate the internet then. Was the 20 years before net nutrality so awful. And did we pay so much more to use certain services because of the greedy corporation. Net Neutrality sounds good, Patriot Act sounds good too but it's as if it does the opposite of what it's called.
$C: How about you work on "reddit neutrality" jackass. What's the point of net neutrality when reddit is censored so heavily by a couple of retarded mods and admins.

That place is nothing but a cancer on reddit and partially responsible for this FCC mess.

Thank you.
$C: Waa waa :( which one of you liberal looney tunes called in a bomb threat? 
$C: Here's what I don't get. I thought we lived in America, but I guess I was wrong. Because in America we all supposedly have the capacity to exercise our freedoms by ourselves. Today, Net Neutrality was overturned by the FCC and I'm seeing people say, "oh well we should still wait and see what happens in Congress, in the courts, whatever."

My question is, when did this stop being America? When did it stop being that if you wanted something done right, you do it yourself and become I hope these people do what I want them to do? The American government hasn't served its people in decades and all of a sudden people think that it will?

For me, no thank you. None of us have any personal obligations to pay for this "service" and quite frankly, in the America that I grew up in, if I pay you to do something you do it how I want, where I want, and when I want or you don't get paid. So I've already started the process to terminate my internet service. I'm an American, I don't rely on other people to fight my battles for me, even if they are an elected representative, when I can perfectly well fight them on my own.

So why do I bother posting it here? Simple, to put the same thoughts to you. Are you in control of your money or are you going to give it to someone else. The ISPs have no legal obligation to provide you the service that you want anymore. If you really want change, then change things with what really drives this country, your money. Pick any major internet group (gamers, youtubers, etc) and if they all ended their accounts tomorrow, the ISPs would experience signficant losses and their stocks would drop. So if you really want change then that's how you do it.

But then again the price of freedom is vigilance and tolerance, and its consequence is complacency.

Peace out, internet.

Even then, the ISP is still in control of whats seen. The whole concept of Reddit is about to become broken." >>>?

I'm completely smooth. including the ball seam. just as promised.
$C: Let's start a petition for FCC Chairman Ajit Pai demanding his resignation for going against the wishes of 84% of Americans. He doesn't represent us but I suspect their may yet be hope of this being repealed. Through AG offices and with the majority of Senate seats up next year their may yet be a congressional repeal. Back to my first point though I feel that there must be balance between what's good for business and what the people want. Chairman Pai chose business over what the people want and since he will fully ignored that almost 2 million comments in support of these changes where faked. For now nothing will change but I hope this is reversed somehow and I'd love to see Pai admit he was wrong and resign for not representing the people he's supposed too as a public servant.
$C: ok spezzy bwoi

$C: This is great news, net neutrality was just another form of cronyism that benefited facebook and google. 
$C: Good riddance, it was rebranded SOPA PIPA anyway
$C: Net neutrality relies on the notion that you can in fact make monopolies work if you have enough regulation.
Even the people for it don't pretend that it will enhance competition so I'm not sure wtf people are doing supporting it.
$C: Good fight comrads, I wish everyone best of luck in this new now hell-hole internet
$C: You guys need to fucking revolt, get out in the streets and drag Mr Pai out of his home. Remind them of physicality, in the sense that laws are not just in the ether.

$C: I'm glad Net Neutrality is gone.  You freaks called in a bomb threat to the FCC today, wtf?
$C: Part of me thinks that this kinda shit is just a lie. The CEO of reddit is most certainly 'friends' with the people who control reality. Leaving a post like this at the top of reddit eases our minds and makes us think spez is actually on the side of the people. This is a very effective form of damage control, in terms of preventing the people from lashing out. But I could be wrong.

$C: oh no t_d are commin
$C: I love my country and all but FUCK THE SYSTEM. 
$C: Best way, is prob not to fabricate issues with your website and put up click walls.  What a joke.  You just want net neutrality because you don't want to start having to pay for the bandwidth you are using.
$C: Family Guy was right about the FCC
$C: Doesn't net neutrality bring more government control? 
$C: yeah act like you give a fuck spez, you sold out r/politics during the election and took thousands of dollars. we know you're a piece of shit, go fuck yourself.
$C: This is what Trump meant by #MAGA.  
$C: Net Neutrality was introduced in 2015 right? So what was the internet like in the US before that?
$C: Let us know when reddit stops suppressing a certain domreddit. Until then, STFU spez, you hypocrite!
$C: How ever might we live without a law that has changed nothing and is only 2 years old? Save me government, save me from you!
$C: I may be a Trump supporter, but as a Canadian, I enjoy my net neutrality, and I would never want it gone. Although I support Trump, I just can't get behind the repeal of net neutrality. I support net neutrality!
$C: hahahah fuck /u/spez 
$C: Lol Reddit bans subs with opinions they don't agree with. Fucking hypocrites, can't wait til this appeal rams you guys up the ass. 
$C: So glad to see Reddit using it's "open platform" to push only one side of misunderstood issue that directly benefits it. That's pretty much the opposite of "open".
$C: The stock markets all have gone down since the FCC decision. 
$C: But her emails...
$C: I heard /u/spez is a pedophile. Is there any truth to that statement?
$C: fuck u
$C: Thanks TRUMP!
$C: Serious question: The FCC ruling that was overturned as only adopted in 2015. Obviously there was internet before 2015...so why is this such a big deal now?
$C: Remove Ajit from the FCC, and I don't care how. 
$C: Pai has been bought and sold.  This is what happens when you vote for someone like trump.  They don't give one shit about normal people.


$C: If it help it looks like the FCC committed fraud. Tons of comments from people on their site in “support” of ending NN, some of them are dead people.. 

Edit: what idiot would down vote this? 
$C: Writing your government representatives doesnt do shit, called mine, wrote mine generic response was the party message. Fucking garbage peaces of shit. 
$C: Fight my pickle rickers. Fight for meme.
$C: If the government doesn't care about the internet, we should just do all of our business with them in paper.
$C: We hold accountable the companies that take advantage of and supported this this. And god, he has the world’s most punchable face. He’s practically asking for it. 
$C: Isn't it obvious that these people are not listening to anything the American public is saying to them? They started spamming their own server with comments at the same time many people started using a bot service to vent their outrage. I put my phone # into a Anti-Repeal website knowing that they would send a message on my behalf to my representative opposing net neutrality. FCC response? Spam themselves with positive comments from a paid astroturfing group. I guess any comments submitted in a similar format are SPAM?? That argument only holds water since YOU SPAMMED YOURSELVES WITH REPEAL SUPPORTING COMMENTS ON YOUR OWN PAGE. Ignoring the obvious conflicts of interest by members on the board of the FCC, this right here is corruption @ the max and needs to be addressed first.

ISPs are now information collection agencies and you are now a product being sold. There is so much wrong with our government and I prefer the lightly corrupted old Swamp to these money grubbing frat boys.
$C: I strongly disapprove with the actions of the current chairman of the FCC, Ajit Varadaraj Pai, to abolish the collections of rules that helped to establish restrictions on what major Internet Service Providers (ISPs) could and could not do. These rules, which helped to set up Net Neutrality, were implemented under the obama administration in late 2015. These rules prevented ISPs from slowing down the upload and download speeds of certain websites, colloquially known as “throttling”. However, due to bribes from major ISPs such as Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast, Ajit Pai (who himself was a former Verizon lawyer) and his cohorts have decided to dismantle these rules that are fundamental to the growth of the internet. It is not only because of these actions, but also because of Ajit Varadaraj Pai’s overall smug demeanor and obnoxious smile that I have come to the conclusion that Ajit Varadaraj Pai is in fact a homosexual who has performed oral sex on the Corporate Executive Officers of all major ISPs, and is now being blackmailed by said CEOs into restructuring the internet into how it was back in 1998, when The Undertaker thew Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16ft through an announcer’s table.
$C: January 1st! Give me 5!(0101) THE DAY OF NO DATA!
Turn off your phone. Unplug your router. (Because your neighbor is using it to watch / stream videos) 
USE NO DATA! If your car is connected DON'T DRIVE!
This is like a General Strike. Obviously is you are a 911 operator or work in a position where this is detrimental to you, your profession or someones health ignore this. BUT If you can, DO IT! Many of you are off or hungover, so do something worthwhile with your time.  Let's show them who and how many people they are FUCKING WITH. Go for a walk. Go for a drive. If it is cold, read a book. Clean your living space. Just use NO DATA!
My first idea was to ask you to cancel cable and internet for a month but I didn't think most people would do that plus some companies have cancellation fees. So January 1st THE DAY OF NO DATA! Give me 5!(0101) Spread the word.
Net Neutrality. 

Yes, as someone on reddit pointed out, this would be like renting a car and not driving it. BUT!
Hundreds of BILLIONS of internet ad dollars are generated every year! THIS WILL HURT!

$C: I'm glad it is gone. If even just to spite the assholes with the spam posts about it. 
$C: good news
$C: Can we just hack the system like a 90s movie? Let's just build a team of teenage hackers and send them to the subway with their laptops to take down the Gibson. 

But really is there something a band of hackers could do to fuck Comcast Verizon ?
$C: Why are all the big companys that are known for censoring.  Like reddit, facebook, and twitter all of the sudden leaders of the free speeh free internet movement?
$C: Wouldn't it be nice if reddit acted like a role model with this site being neutral? It does seem a little weird to scream about neutrality when your own site is so obviously not neutral.
$C: Scumbag Spez.  Wants Net Neutrality.  Censors dissenting thought.
$C: You know with how hard you fight for Internet freedom BUT you prevent the Donald from showing up in the Popular section KINDA makes you a Hypocrite Spez... just saying

$C: Vote Libertarian.
$C: (Serious question) Why is it that no one cared about this until net neutrality was put in place and now being removed? Why wasnt this a problem before net neutrality was a created? And why is it all the sudden a problem now that its gone again?
$C: #Based Ajit Senpai 
$C: Sorry u/spez, but until you quit censoring your own site, fuck off.

To everyone else, your internet is going to be just fine.  
$C: SAD!
$C: /u/spez: Please stop censoring conservatives, or else go fuck yourself and net neutrality.
$C: FUCK u/SPEZ. Just wanted to say that. Carry on rest of you.
$C: ITT: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.
$C: I love the fact that a brown man from an ethnic minority became a hate figure for all those SJWs, Lefties and so called Liberals who reeeee about bigotry, racism and oppression till one messes with their broadband. Beyond woke hilarious.
$C: CEO of Reddit criticizing someone over Net Neutrality. Top fucking kek 
$C: The shroud of the dark side has fallen, begun the internet wars have.
$C: Seems like words aren't solving this issue,  I'm starting to think revolutionary tactics might be needed to send a clear message.
$C: The internet is going to be as horrible as it was in 2015 now!!! 
$C: Net neutrality has been presented completely backwards, so thanks to anyone who has posted and rallied everyone against the repeal. Let's get a quick reality check. #1 the internet was much better and was thriving before NN originally came into play (before 2015). #2 NN actually allows your local government to not only stall, but to make it illegal to expand broadband to communities that don't have it already(fact). #3 all of this was presented backwards to the public ALL OVER THE INTERNET. (Also fact)

First things first: look at WHY NC AND TN are suing the FCC over the decision. It's not about the decision itself, it's about it's implications to their monopoly on broadband. NC and TN are BOTH SUING FOR THE STATES RIGHT TO LIMIT BROADBAND. This means that if there is a neighborhood just outside of city limits, no one can build internet to them. NC and TN are suing to keep citizens OFF the internet, they are also suing to retain their monopolies, they are afraid of real competition in the private sector. Look at reality folks, the death of NN means that we citizens of NC get faster and cheaper internet, and we are not the only ones. This decision actually allows real competition to move in, and I can't wait. 

If you want to debate, please bring sources and date, no fear mongering. I have been following this issue for years and despite what they try to tell you, the FCC has always been on the right side of this battle to me. The only reason to support NN is if you DO NOT believe everyone deserves a chance to be on the net. Read into it, stop listening to Facebook and YouTube for Christ sakes. 

Today's issue is no different than in 2014 when we tried to STOP NN. It amazes me how things get so backwards when people accept what is spoon fed to them. 

https://youtu.be/HNSze_yW34g

Also from 2015: Tom Wheeler gives a great opener about NN. "If you support broadband, then you can't support limits on who can provide it"

https://youtu.be/1g5l6WyJAgQ
$C: Guys, we seriously don't need the fucking government in our internet. 

There is other ways to hold the companies accountable for their bullshit, and the government doesn't need to be a part of that. 

Just because NN has been rescinded doesn't mean the worlds going to end. 

Everyone in here is crying like if the sky is falling. It's not, and it won't, stop being doomsayers over this shit. 

You really think companies like NetFlix, Hulu, and the like won't fight to change anything that MIGHT(KEYWORD HERE) happen? 

The government does NOT need to be a part of our internet. 

And for those of you with those "Auto-Dialer" email scripts and websites, stop, just fucking stop. Those are considered as spam, and they've shown us that. 

Sending the same fucking letter 10 million times doesn't exactly show people give a shit, it just looks like a spam bot.

$C: The Internet is free again!
$C: All you folks fighting for net neutrality with law are ignorant serfs fighting a losing battle because you are insistent on playing by rules designed to work against you.

You hire representatives to represent your interests when forcing your ideas and opinions onto everyone. They instead represent the corporations and special interests and work to squeeze every available resource from the serfs that they can get away with. This will happen over and over and over again until you stop it. Get it?

If you want your net neutrality, you are going to have to play hardball irrespective of any government bullshit.

Boycott all ISP's not offering neutral internet service, and regardless of consequences. DO NOT WAIVER. Either they provide internet service that the people demand or they go bankrupt.

That is your only hope.

Hi guys, my name is Pickle-Do.

Subscribe to help my channel grow!
$C: If Reddit had been this pro-Hillary in 2016, it wouldn't need to be so pro-net neutrality in 2017. You say "we're not done fighting", but the real fight for net neutrality was over a year ago. What good are you doing now? Does it really outweigh the harm that this website has done through its non-action and the normalization of TD? I doubt it.
$C: Glad to see it finally repealed - opens the Internet once again instead of it being run by the government and monopolies. 

Bring on the downvotes, ignorant people :)
$C: Good call. Fuck government regulation.
$C: Fuck yourself. 
$C: To be honest I understand the concern with net neutrality but there are a lot of benefits it poses. Less regulation is actually better, but the thing is, these companies are still a problem like att Comcast and other providers because of their powerful influence over the industry. We need to contact them spam them do whatever we can to make sure they keep the best experience for their customers. Fighting our politicians on this is not going to get us anywhere. Look what Happened to EA. They pulled a greedy move, and we gave em hell for it, so why not hold service providers to the same standard? Like I said if we keep fighting politicians, we won't get anywhere, as a community we need to focus on the root of the problem, not net neutrality, which the lack of actually will help smaller service providers get more business. Please don't be a sheep and educate yourself on the matter and not simply doing what John Oliver or Steven Colbert tells you to. Thank you if you reading all this if you did and please be respectful if you disagree.
$C: #WHY HAVE NETWORK NEUTRALITY IF THE SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE JUST GOING TO LOCK THREADS.

#REDDIT ISN'T NEUTRAL, NOW THEIR PROVIDER WON'T BE EITHER
$C: [removed]
$C: Why does reddit fight so hard for net neutrality when it can't even keep its own site subreddit neutral? With that said, I'm obviously for neutrality in both cases.
$C: This is so weird. My Internet still works. I was promised an apocalypse and death of the web.
$C: This may be my last comment.
$C: I'm just commenting here to be a part of history, folks! I'm thinking this comment can be used to briefly take your mind off how shitty this whole situation is.

Have a great day, everyone! :)
$C: FUCK OFF U/SPEZ
$C: Am I the only one who thinks Ajit Pai should have been pulled out? He looks like a rapist
$C:  I AINT FINISH SCHOOL TF U GOT ME READIN PARAGRAPHS CAN SOMEONE DUMV THIZ DOWN TO MY LEBEL WILL THEY BE TRYNA CHARGE ME A EXTRA 4.99 FOR PORNHUB OR NOT?
$C: lol, all these people saying "Contact your <whatever> politician, tell them yaddayadda."

That didn't work so far so why would you tell them to do the same thing again and again? The government has shown that it will not listen to people making their voice heard. The biggest scam ever foisted on the voter is the idea that you can complain to a politician who is hell-bent on doing what he wants. 
$C: I made this account ( cus #1 i don't remember my original account, # my original account probably is filled with a dark past of shitty meme failed memes, #3 felt the need to speak even if its online). I have been getting anxiety over this vote the past few days and watched the live hearing with fear but with hope that the American people would be heard. But no, seems like u cant win in this world anymore. Its sad too because people used too say I'm very optimistic and positive but with the current political climate and these current events. I have become fully convinced that you can beat the 1% even if we try.  For a moment I thought it was gonna be OK but after some of the comments that the some of the chairmen said today, it became  too apparent to me that many government officials are motivated by what best suites them rather than the public. I would like to say I'm so proud of the people who called and put their time in to try to save our freedoms. This isn't a rant against you. I simply feel defeated by a government that outright ignores the public. I hope I am proven wrong ( i really do) but I have little hope for the future of the internet.

$C: Sucks that the elite companies didn't get their way :(
$C: ahahaha
$C: Sucks to suck, losers!
$C: to all of you who are saying   mm salty lib tears  or ha ha you lose you do realize if course that you’re using the internet  this will affect you and the donald brigadiers you may the the first to go
$C: We did it, Reddit!
$C: Why should we support you and your efforts if you insist on censoring people you disagree with? 
$C: Need net neutral enviroment to spam fuck spez in
$C: I just really hope all those "but I just can't vote for Hillary because she only agrees with 98% of what I want, and I want 140%" voters are happy with this. 

You deserve it!
$C: [deleted]
$C: Reddit fights filtering internet content... Shortly after implementing filtering internet content on their site. Love the irony.
$C: I 100% guaranty that the bomb threats called into the FCC today is from a Redditor that Spez' campaign encouraged. 
$C: A victory for liberty, fuck you /u/spez and your corporate shilling masquerading as grassroots
$C: I find it interesting that you fight for net neutrality, and yet your site is anything but neutral this very hypocritical.
$C: Now that this is over, what are we going to be outraged about next week. Am looking to get a head start.
$C: Hey spez, does reddit censor it's users and have you been known to edit peoples' posts?

Hey, cool *bots* with the top comments! Reddit is grassroots!

Whining about Net Neutrality is gay and no one cares. Just more governmental overreach to be exploited if we happen to come into contact with some shitty socialist government.
$C: Ironic how much you push for Net Neutrality yet reddit is far from neutral. When are you going to stop limiting T_D, or allowing blatant vote manipulation, like the other days “I’m senator x and I took $y from the telecom companies” 

I remember the days of reddit refusing to censor subreddits because they disagreed with them. Now, subreddits about fatpeople are deleted because they’re offensive. 
$C: Fuck you spez
$C: Net neutrality = government regulation of internet. Why would anyone want that?
$C: When are you done fighting? When will you shut up and accept that it's right and proper for the people who own the internet to control it?
$C: Fuck /u/spez
$C: Fuck outta here. Reddit is not neutral. Far from it. Same for Twitter and Facebook.

Because of censorship and uneven application of rules, these places lean heavily left. The last thing they want is for the discussions taking place here to *actually* be neutral.

They want to control these platforms and use them to push the leftist agenda. Any regulations will be used disproportionately against one side just like we see them doing now.
$C: Fuck /u/spez
$C: Hey /u/spez, you are a fear mongering douchebag.
$C: Although I absolutely hate the idea of republicans winning anything, I have to side with them on this.

I live in a rural area where we have only 1 provider for cable internet. They have a monopoly on the entire area and they have raised prices twice in the past 5 years. 

I hate every second of it. Yes I can "move" to a more urban area where I can get Verizon FiOs or whatever. But uprooting my family, finding a new job, just for better priced internet is intolerable.

I'm giving Pai the benefit of the doubt. The aim he wants is to make it easier for these service providers to get more consumers, particularly the rural and low income american.

"yes" under these laws they can throttle a website or online service. But why? From a business perspective and a "I want to make lots of money" view, it makes zero sense. Why would spectrum or verizon, or whoever just systematically charge you more money to access reddit or youtube? the moment they do that, their competitor is gonna do the opposite and steal away customers. Its bad business practice, they wouldn't do that.

Ideally, we will see companies offering free subscription services to consumers if they jump from their competitors and join them. Companies will provide more infrastructure to areas that have none now that they can actively compete. 

Last thing I want to put. The most powerful voting tool isn't a letter to congress, or a voters ballot. Its the almighty dollar. Companies are now being watched by millions americans, waiting to see what new offers will be made. What new innovations will be created.

"Okay [Insert Service Provider here], offer me something that will make me choose you over everyone else." 

Competition is going to be fierce, I want this. I want to choose my service provider, not have to be forced to go with one because there are no other providers.
$C: One step closer to the end of Reddit and Facebook.  I couldn't be more proud of the Republican party today.
$C: Don’t use the internet if you don’t want to pay?
Biggest complainers are the largest freeloaders.  
$C: #SPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ YOUUUU LOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSSSSSTTTTTTTT SPPPPPPPPPPPEEEEEEEEEZZZZZZZZZZZZZ YOU PEDO CUNT
$C: As the most censored man on reddit -- your site having publicly banned a few of my subreddits -- I have to laugh at your sanctimony. Free speech is dead on the internet, and you killed it, you, facebook, twitter, youtube/google. Your admins have also deleted posts bringing up examples of violent behavior on reddit in the very thread announcing rules against it, because they conflicted with your political beliefs.

You have banned subreddits because they "conflicted with your personal values," have edited comments that you felt were insulting, have played favorite with certain political ideas while hiding others from the front page. Verizon and comcast haven't done this. Fearmongering about scenarios that never played out prior to NN is simply that, fearmongering, but when someone looks at history it is simply you guys wanting to be the monopoly. It's a lie, Steve, you're lying as usual.

I applaud Ajit Pai and the FCC for making the correct decision. 
$C: Reddit: Waaaa Trump and the government are the enemies! Boooo!

Also Reddit: No please Trump and government, don't give up some power, please no! Boooo!
$C: Don't blame me, I voted for Hillary.

Did you?
$C: Wait, ARE YOU SAYING THAT THEY REPEALED NET NEUTRALITY!?!?

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!!
$C: The only way we don't lose right now is if someone kills pai. That's it. Otherwise good bye internet. The isp have full on plans on how and what to throttle. Come new years the internet will be gutted.

We lost. Time to take to the streets. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: you mean flooding the front page with NN spam didnt help??? :((((

$C: We are coming after all of you in Silicon Valley.

You thought you could roll out private censorship, but now we're going to burn your little shitshow to the ground and rebuild it in our image.

$C: You want net neutrality, but you actively fight against subreddit neutrality?

Don't be a hypocrite. 
$C: My refrigerator just broke. I didn't even realize Net Neutrality was going to affect home appliances!!!
$C: Wonderful news.  Get the Government out of things.  Great day,

$C: You had your chance and you blew it. why are redditors so incompetent? couldn't identify the boston bomber and couldn't stop NN being repealed.


$C: We deserve this. If we really cared about NN we would have voted for Democrats last year. NOT write in for Bernie and NOT for Jill Stein. But actual candidates that had a chance, who understand the issue. Fuck us we deserve this. 
$C: Translation: We don't care about your freedom, we only care about them shekels!

$C: Reddit: let's make the internet neutral and fair!

Also Reddit: let's create an algorithm that suppresses and censors the third* most active sub on the entire site!

*http://redditlist.com then click recent activity.

Reddit also made an unannounced partnership with a company that will monitor all your activity for thought crime.

https://www.sprinklr.com/pr/sprinklr-announces-strategic-partnership-drive-customer-engagement-care-reddit/

$C: Hahaha all that effort wasted! Personally find it hilarious! There's your positive.

Edit: on a more serious note. Net neutrality is a false flag for you idiots. The real problems are the environmental regulations under attack. That will affect health and our natural resources. But here you are worried, for no reason I might add, that your ability to watch porn or Netflix might be affected. Get off the fucking couch,  you nitwits. There are real issues out there.
$C: u/spez are you aware that your username is incredibly similar to the epithet spaz? just wondering
$C: Hahahahaha. The greatest country on earth indeed.
$C: The amount of fear mongering behind this topic is insane. As is the astrotufing campaign associated with it. One of the biggest campaigns I've ever seen. To call it organic is just dishonest. 

The internet will be fine. Everyone should just calm down. 
$C: Hard to take Reddit seriously when they censor their own subs. But I’m sure their billionaire investors must be devastated 
$C: if you neckbearded fucks worried as much about global warming / cancer / all the murders in your country you would accomplish a lot more. sad to see all this energy go to waste for internet. pathetic
$C: Fact:  80% of Americans are borderline retarded.

Also a fact:  80% of people on reddit support net neutrality legislation.  Coincidence?  I think not.

Have any of you ever considered that you are completely fucking wrong on this subject and have been brainwashed by the most effective propaganda campaign in the 21st century?
$C: lol good riddance. 
$C: Good. It's about time net neutrality was repealed. The government has no right to regulate the internet. Ajit Pai is doing good work, those of you who can't see that need to do your research instead of basing your opinions on NN memes.
$C: So when nothing bad happens such as "The internet will be taken away" or "We'll have to pay $200 bucks per month to use reddit, youtube, Netflix, twitter etc" will all of you guys admit you were wrong?

Will you guys admit this? Doubtful

You guys were brainwashed by powerful companies like reddit, twitter, Netflix, Soros, etc into believing this was doomsday 
$C: Hey, can you not force this bullshit onto my feed?
$C: Nobody voted. Reddit is idiot.
$C: Lmao get wrecked
$C: Have they finally got rid of the solution to something that was not a problem to begin with? Have they voted Net Neutrality down? I can't wait anymore, end government control internet.
$C: Ahahahahahahahahahaha!!!

This censored shithole didn't get what they wanted! 
$C: How ironic that you /u/spez post this, considering you were found modifying Reddit users' posts for political propagandistic purposes. And you want neutrality?
$C: Net neutrality needed gutted for the sake of the free market and disallowing government control. I've never seen so much false information spewed around before this net neutrality nonsense, ISP's were already allowed by law currently to throttle your internet, so long as they didn't claim neutral.

The internet isn't going to instantly turn into an EA microtransaction hellhole, it's the same internet we've had for the past 30 years.

Now get to work suing Comcast and ISP monopolies! They are finally vulnerable and out under the thumb of government protection.
$C: [deleted]
$C: So when are we going to get subreddit neutrality instead of the current system where you remove and sabotage subreddits that you disagree with politically?
$C: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA


$C: Ironic, isn't it? American.
This website always joke about how America is controlled by a bunch of old white males and you decide to tag politician's affiliation based on their race.
And now the person that ended your internet freedom is in fact an Indian descent.

Take notes, American. Your country has always has a greater problem in social class instead of race. You should've focus on the former instead of the later. Hope this listening gives you a proper wake up call.

If you believe a country is sufficient to run when it has laws to guarantee freedom and people can become as rich as possible so long as freedom of the lower class is guaranteed. Think again.
History continues to teach us when a small group of people obtain large amount of money, whether through just or unjust means, they will use it to further expand their power, to the point of disrupting other classes' freedom. Only through more delicate laws that supervise not only the distribution of rights but also the distribution of income can a country thrive. 
$C: Can I tell you who would have stopped the repeal of Net Neutrality? Hillary Clinton.
$C: U/spez will you specifically advocate for nonviolence in protesting this repeal? Because someone just called in a bomb threat to the hearing. 
$C: Lol. Loving this thread.
$C: yanks don't deserve the internet.
$C: How about you start fighing censorship and bot farms on your site, spez?
$C: MAGA
$C: Hahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!
$C: [deleted]
$C: Fuck net neutrality, this is a victory for the internet and the world at large. Everyone knows this to be true.
$C: Hahahahh😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😃😃🤣
$C: Not supporting it, but I think there will be a violent response. 
$C: I honestly hope someone assassinates Ajit Pai
$C: shut up loser
$C: Hahahahahaahhaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahaahhaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahgahahahahahaha
$C: Hilarious!  You reddit clowns have no clue what "net nuetrality" really is.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Poor reddit has to find out how to make money going forward instead of depending on the socialized nature of the internet to get by. You poor, poor babies. Whatever will you do?
$C: Glad it was repealed.  You'll see soon enough that you're better off.
$C: But they haven't voted yet at time of posting. I'm watching live- only two of the five board members have voted.

 Currently one in favor of repeal, one against.

Watch at https://www.fcc.gov/general/live
$C: Apparently they canceled the vote
$C: Sounds more like the FCC is forcing congress to actually do something. 
$C: Can anyone eli5 to me why it will affect us non US countries? 
$C: Reddit (the company) getting involved politics like this is disgusting
$C: Hey pal, preemptive mass government regulation to "fix" a non existent market failure is NEVER a good thing. Your scare-mongering and hysteria are not snowing most of this generation. 
$C: How about you start paying the sites you steal your content from? And the users who generate it for you?

Why would we support your ridiculous money grab until you start compensating content creators fairly?

Run Reddit as a non-profit like Wikipedia and we'll support net neutrality for you. Until then you're just one set of rich people arguing against another set.
$C: Fuck my life 
$C: Lol spez shut the fuck up. You are the cunt asshole who changes comments from people that disagree with you. 
$C: He trolled you guys so hard in his video. Oml it was great
$C: You didn't do jack shit, reddit admins, so stop talking about fight and activism while the only thing you did was put a stupid banner on top of your logo
$C: The more things change, the more they stay the same. The net of yesterday is not the net we use today, and it won't be the same tomorrow no matter what passes or doesn't. Personally I miss the days when it was all like the wild west, a barren waste with scattered populations we called websites. Todays net feels like a giant department store, aisles and aisles of nothing. My net nuetrality was killed off years ago, and while I applaud everyone for fighting the good fight, we lost a long time ago. 
$C: Lead us like the sheep we are master <3
$C: Time to put Pai on a stake. 
$C: So essentially what you are saying is the last time I'll be able to afford reddit...
$C: Lol, i guy who edits people's comments on a website that tracks and sells your personal information telling us why we should support internet service run by private business. Even though net neutrality is clearly better than the alternative, the irony is insane.
$C: haha who golded this?
$C: How much is it going to cost to get on the Reddit now? Please help.
$C: Swamp drained.
$C: So, any plans to change the deceptive “monthly bandwidth” banner?

Any regrets that basically none of the big sites actually did much to oppose the vote aside from a quiet statement or two?

Any regrets about how anti-Trump people smeared the internet and claimed interference, weakening support for the current system?

Will there be a Trump decision that you all won’t act like is approaching Armageddon?
$C: >It was inspiring to witness organic takeovers of the front page

As opposed to your daily inorganic manipulation, and censorship sitewide.

You failed to seize the means of ~~production~~ information. You are just another in a long line of socialist failures broken upon the rocks of capitalism, and freedom. Socialism always fails because both the ideology and practitioners are flawed and delusional.

You have done bad things, and should feel bad, but are too arrogant and self righteous to do so. To twist your own idiotic words: You just need to remember that ISPs have always been free market, conservative, right leaning platforms.

When you don't practice what you preach, you become disliked like a certain failed, and crooked Presidential candidate. You lose the support of the people, and no one believes a word you say anymore. People are not as stupid, ignorant and completely manipulable as you believe them to be. Sure, you can fool some of them all the time, and all of them some of the time, but not all of them all the time. Every time you fail to fool you lose credibility, and erode a little more.  
$C: [deleted]
$C: So why wasn't the internet as bad as people before 2015, when the protections were introduced? I love net neutrality, but I'm a little confused. People are talking about packages and ISPs splitting up the internet and making pay people pay extra, but that wasn't the case before 2015, right? 
$C: What the fuck is the head of a private business commanding people to do his bidding. You can love or hate NN but this repeal hurts reddit in the wallet so of course spez is against it, why the fuck is he using redditors.
$C: Fools.
$C: WE DID IT 4CHAN
WE DEFEATED THE EVIL NET  NEUTRALITY 
WE BEAT MK ULTRA

$C: Fuck off spez.  You are a piece of shit.  All you care about is your bottom line. 
$C: But what if I like the decision? 
$C: Did you just.... gold your own post? HAHAHAHA
$C: FUCK YOU DUMBASS BACKWARDS ASS REDNECK FUCKING USLESS PIECES OF HUMAN FUCKING SHIT REPUBLICANS. 
I hope your children burn to death in car fires while you watch. 

$C: Down with Net Neutrality!! 
$C: Am I only one hoping to get faster internet out here in the sticks
$C: Good job fucking up the internet to own the libs
$C: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mSllqze5ca8/TFUlMFLQRcI/AAAAAAAAACI/pFCi-5kZLsA/s1600/Butthurt-ad-de.jpg
$C: I'd write a scathing response to this citing several times you've censored the opinions of redditors you did not agree with.  How you had to manipulate the front page algorithm so certain sub-reddits never made it to the front page.  How you personally edited redditor's comments without their permission or knowledge.  I won't bother since you'll probably delete or edit it to hell.  You don't believe in a free and open internet.  Hypocrite.
$C: Donald: Why do I have to pay another $20 for the MLB Sports Internet package?

Melania: The FCC killed net neutrality under your administration.

Donald: Who did that?

Melania: Ajit Pai, the man you appointed to destroy Title II

Donald: No, that was Hillary.

Melania: ...

Donald: Okay tell the warden of this prison I authorize the increase.
$C: The whole concept of net neutrality is to distract dumb commoners.

&nbsp;

What _I'd_ rather accuse them of doing is letting 4-ish ISPs control internet access for the entirety of the continent. Yes, that loophole. A group of companies acting as a cartel regardless of affiliation **IS** still a monopoly.

If you would just think a little harder, you'd realize that net neutrality is a distraction that only applies to your very specific, situational infrastructure that guarantees competition cannot start.
$C: So... the circle jerk's not over?  I was hoping we could go back to pictures of cats... :-(
$C: I’ll be sure to write them commending their commitment to a free and open internet by supporting the repeal of “net neutrality.”
$C: KEEP VOTING FOR REPUBLICANS YOU FUCKING RED TWATS!!!!
$C: In the long run, this will have been a good thing

Edit: I'm interested to hear why you disagree
$C: [deleted]
$C: Lol i did nothing to stop this
$C: soon we wont be able to access Reddit, just like pre 'Net Neutrality'
$C: am i ignored
$C: Woah Reddit doesn't control the world. I'm shocked. 
$C: Thank God! Now we won’t have the same technology for the next 50 years just like the telecom industry did from the 40’s to the 90’s 
$C: Remember, this isn’t Ajit Pai’s fault, this is all Donald Trump’s doing. It’s just weird how aggressively the focus is being shifted onto someone APPOINTED AND FULLY SUPPORTED by Trump.

Edit: I should clarify. Mitch McConnell recommended, then nominated Ajit Pai to his position as a commissioner of the FCC (when net neutrality wasn’t a public debate), Obama had to appoint him because of the republican-majority senate. Trump then made Ajit Pai chairman of the FCC in January.
$C: All the beep bop booops are mad net neutrality got flushed figures
$C: /u/HandofBane what does this mean for our vadeo gmeaes
$C: Love wins!
$C: Good grief the drama queen hysterics are ridiculous. 

The world is not ending, nor is the internet. It was fine for 15 years. The reality is the Obama administration exceeded the authority given to the FCC by illegally declaring the internet a utility in order to regulate it.

Regulations must be considered carefully to avoid stifling innovation. 

This issue shows the utter power of misinformation to pretty much sucker everybody who goes online into a fear-mongering panic. People are sheep.

I DO believe it is wrong for ISPs to charge more for Netflix etc. or block websites from competitors. But, ISPs know the backlash they would receive for doing so these days. 

Net neutrality is a good principle that I do support, but the FCC is not the proper venue to do so when it does not have the statutory authority over the internet. The proper venue? Congress! They can change things. 

But, the Obama administration, like it did pretty regularly and was slapped down by the courts at times for doing so, basically did whatever it wanted regardless of law via executive action.
$C: Boring.....
$C: Hey /u/spez why don't you say what the security reasons for the delay were?

Could it be another terrorist lefty?
$C: #Don't get mad, get organized.

Every Single Congressperson is up for re-election in 2018. 

https://www.270towin.com/2018-house-election/

34 Senate Seats are being decided in 2018:

https://www.270towin.com/2018-senate-election/

The Republican majority is against Net Neutrality so the only way to reverse this is to throw out as many Republicans as we can. 

Even that won't be enough because were we to get Net Neutrality legislation passed in both the house and the senate, it requires a signature from President Trump.

President Trump is the person who put Pai in charge of the FCC specifically to kill Net Neutrality. 

So if you're serious, Trump needs to go as well. Impeachment will not be enough because Mike Pence shows no inclination to support Net Neutrality either. So there are a few ways to do this:

The REALLY hard way:  
1) Throw both the House and the Senate to Democratic Control.  
2) Elect a new House Speaker who is a Democrat.  
3) Remove both the President and the Vice President from office.  
That would result in the Democratic Speaker of the House becoming President and it would be absolutely unprecedented to remove both the President and Vice President at the same time. There's like a 0.0001% chance this would happen. 

The Hard Way:  
Get a Constitutional Amendment guaranteeing Net Neutrality.

We've already established that the Republican House and Senate won't do it, but if we can get 38 states to sign off on it (3/4 Majority) we can force a new Constitutional Amendment enforcing Net Neutrality.

It can be done, it has been done, but getting it done before damage is done would be incredibly hard.

The "Easy" Way:  
1) Throw both the House and the Senate to Democratic Control.  
2) Remove Trump and Pence in the 2020 election.  
3) Pass legislation guaranteeing Net Neutrality.  

Pretty long odds on this one too. Unless the House and the Senate both convert to Democratic control there's no way to move Net Neutrality legislation forward, even if it did go forward, Trump wouldn't sign it.
$C: Nuke the middle east
$C: Get fucked libtards :)
$C: Yes, he should go to jail/die/be lynched for doing his job. Right. Fucking communist hivemind hardly speaks for the whole of America. A slacktivist group of keyboard warriors who do nothing more than throw sick threats at those they don’t approve of. 
$C: NN repealed and trannys allowed in muh military

Win some/lose some I suppose.
$C: You fucking scrubbed Seth Rich's account. We watched it happen as it was happening. Don't fucking preach to me Spez, you ignorant, totalitarian propagandist.

I know people are going to get butt hurt because this is reddit but reading this, there are some good things that came of repealing net neutrality. We have to wait and see if the cons emerge.
$C: Predictably frustrating for you and all other shills on Soros' payload

All the nu males start screaming in unison, scream harder than you did during the 2016 election, let's hear if you can scream louder than the sound of us winning! 

AHAHAHAHAH I'M GONNA RUB IT IN YOUR FACE FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR AHAHAHA REDDIT MELTDOWN 

GO AHEAD AND SHOWER ME WITH YOUR IMPOTENT NERD RAGE DOWNVOTES THAT'S ALL YOU CAN DO AHAHAHA 
$C: I agree strongly with Ajit Pai's decision backed by President Trump. Im very glad these heavy handed archaic OBAMA era regulations are gone. The internet is more free today than yesterday and that's something we should all rejoice. MAGA! 
$C: /u/Spez has no right to be an admin. He edits the posts of his opponents on Reddit when he feels like it. He's violated website rules over and over again. Censoring and editing opinions and statements you don't like is literally what the end of net neutrality will become in a nutshell.

https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/23/13739026/reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-edit-comments
$C: Thank you, Pai. You are a legend!
$C: So let me get this straight, the internet has been around for no less the 20+ years.  The Net Neutrality agreement has been in place for barely 2.5 years( Apr 2015 FCC approved).  Did internet services or prices change as a result of gaining Net Neutrality..No!  Why? Because it did nothing.  Will internet services or prices change as a result of losing Net Neutrality..No!  Why? Because the ISP's throttle and restrict traffic already.  A change in a government policy that has been in place for less than 2.5 years on a service which is privately owned and run for 20+ years does nothing!!!!!  Stop complaining already!!
$C: Fuck you SPEZ! death to NN!
$C: Shut up spez. Your opinion means squat when you censor reddit and favor some content over others.
$C: I truly wonder what you dumb fucks will be saying a year or two from now when literally nothing will fucking change about the internet.
$C: This was great! Wtf you talking about?
$C: I am against NN.  Keep the Internet Free!
$C: You’ve neglected to answer my question entirely. Instead you went on a rant about evangelicals and tired criticisms of the GOP as a whole.

How is “republican majority states specifically in the south” different from “southern GOP States?”
$C: Get a grip people. You're acting like it's the end of the world. smh
$C: Lol so u butthurt betas at reddit lost again?  SUCK A DICK YOUR ACTIVISM IS PATHETIC !!
$C: So you want net neutrality while you censor conservatives across your platform? Why no subreddit neutrality, u/spez? 

Gonna do something about the multiple calls to violence on Ajit Pai coming from your platform, u/spez? 
$C: Fuck corrupt government control of the Internet. Fuck net neutrality!!!
$C: Can Canada help?
$C: My glock is neutral to people as well

$C: Idiots supporting government tyranny. How ignorant do you have to be to support net neutrality. Absolutely astonishing how many people buy into the ridiculous propaganda. 
$C: If you want to make a difference vote Democrat (preferably Berniecrat), the whole ticket, every election (and yes, I mean the midterms you lazy bastards!).
$C: I’m a hardcore Trump supporter. Well, I was. 

Now I’m near the bottom right corner of the political compass. The enemy of my enemy (hate repubs now) is my friend. (Dems, for now). 
$C: i said who ever repealed net neutrality yo mom's a hoe 
$C: I’m told by my roommate he got a notice to expect our internet expense to go up in the next few months to over 500 bucks to almost a thousand. I can’t drop the service either because I’m literally starting online classes! Also to expect charge based on data... no self employ from home jobs either!

Also I’m told the... thing... in office is planing on vetoing anything net neutrality related congress tries to pass... 
$C: Forget about political borders. This is the internet, the right to knowledge and speech being taken away. Republican or Democrat we need to bring back net neutrality
$C: Get fucked, /u/spez.  

Try platform neutrality sometime.

$C: Let's make a website of Photoshops of Pai  getting pleasure from a mule.  And if the site is shut down well open a store and sell march of Pai giving a bj to big biz.
$C: All I hear is 'REEEEEEEEEEEE' 
That PSA was an all-time great and made this man a legend.
I've never seen so much salt on Reddit. So many death threats.

Oh, and fuck u/spez
$C: Why is there a white power fist behind the reddit symbol? 😅
$C: Thank God he got rid of that horrific load of bullshit. Neutrality my ass. More like total government control. And Reddit always bows down to the liberal communist overlords.
$C: Not frustrating for me, speak for yourself idiot
$C: Ding, dong the net neutrality witch is dead!!
$C: If u people actually think this will ruin the internet, you are stupid. This is actually a very nuanced debate with very valid arguments for both sides. Anyone who understands economics knows that this will change nothing about the internet and the way it operates.

/r/NoNetNeutrality  
$C: DEAR WHITE PEOPLE:  your enemies in this fight are the members of the neo-nazis(alt-right) among which Ajit Pai is a member. Quick google search results....https://www.google.com/search?q=dailycaller+ajitpai+video&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS731US731&oq=dailycaller+ajitpai+video&aqs=chrome..69i57.10810j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8    ... If you want to understand how to fight this...know who your enemy is. Don't depend on anything from the Republican party...They have already been overrun.
$C: Oh no my internet is sooooooo slow now
$C: These comments are the highest yielding salt mine on the planet. 
$C: GUYS I JUST TRIED TO POST ON REDDIT AND VERIZON SAID I HAVE TO GIVE THEM A DOLLAR FIRST.  OMGMOGMOGOMG
$C: It's so funny how you talk about net neutrality when you spend all your time censoring THE DONALD. You're the last person who should ever talk neutrality. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: I support net neutrality, but I don't think the end of the internet is coming if it's overturned. I wish we could calm down on the hyperbolic rhetoric. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Happy about the vote today. Ready for NN to be repealed asap!
$C: The death of "Net Neutrality" is a victory for humanity, because now we're not going to be subsidising the growth of companies killing and censoring the internet like Twitter and Google (think of how every tech company you hate is in support of this--obviously it benefits them greatly) by keeping their bandwidth rates artificially low.

I'm writing a letter of thanks to Ajit Pai as we speak. I want to let him know that it's because of consumers like me he should fight on all of our behalves.
$C: Fantastic decision. NN was only implemented as an Obama ploy for government control of voters. Also, I don't see the big deal about paying, some sites are just more deserving of traffic than others - why should some shitty blog be equal to a big content provider (paying more allows good content to be maintained, this goes for anything, get what you pay for)
$C: lol,

And once again Reddit learns how irrelevant it's liberal hysteria "activism" is in the real world. 
$C: ending net neutrality is good. I predict we will have faster internet speeds as a result. Companies like Netflix have already agreed to foot the bill, because they use massive amounts bandwidth. Deals to increase ISPs bandwidth infrastructure have and will occur. If you just watched John Oliver you actually don't understand net neutrality.  
$C: [redacted]
$C: Now fcc can enforce anti trust laws and we can have real competition 
$C: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
$C: Suck on that communists.
$C: Thank god. All these NN posts were cancerous. I can't believe these social rejects actually think repealing it would a bad thing. All this "increase in monthly pay" is such a BS narrative. These guys just want to think they're being important because they have nothing else going for their lives. This is going to help so many small ISPs.
$C: Maybe we should have a free and open Reddit?

Oh sorry, I'll just retreat back to my quarantine in the_donald.

Spez: :P

Spez: Spez: Oh no, the downvotes. How could I have foreseen such a turn of events?
$C: Duck you spez, you're one of those shitty enablers.  Also thanks auto correct.
$C: Maybe next time you libs should think twice about illegal immigration and "common sense gun safety save the children" legislation. You might just be able to win an election!
$C: /u/spez, why do you allow Reddit to be astroturfed and spammed to oblivion with bots when it agrees with your own political agenda?

Why do you allow them to spread clear disinformation? 
$C: Fuck you spez
$C: I'm tired of innovation, cost reduction and speeds being stifled by title II regulation. Netflix alone drains so much bandwidth and so does other new innovating technologies. It's time to save consumers a buck for out of control internet moguls. 
$C: Shout outs to President Obama for nominating Ajit Pai to the FCC, and every single Senator, Republican and Democrat, for unanimously approving Pai.  See where voting for the D gets you?  
$C: Awesome news! Internet was ruined by poor people and liberals. Time for them to leave! Bye bye plebs! 👋👋
$C: Reddit crybabies BTFO
$C: good, get rekt
$C: Hey u/spez. How can you fight for net neutrality when you openly censor and edit subs you don't agree with on your own site? Isn't that exactly the opposite of "neutrality?".

Also for the uninformed, the "net Neutrality" bill was simply a power grab for more government control, effectively being the opposite of what the name implies. I can't wait for it to be repealed.
$C: Spez is a CUCK
$C: TRUMP’S FCC FOR THE WIN!!!
$C: Leftist: We support democracy!

Also leftist: Grrr the procress of democracy didn't end in our favor so we're going to throw a tantrum now!

You lost get over it! The internet isn't going anywhere, pre 2015 internet was better anyways.

Edit: I was waiting for the down vote brigade, was not disappointed =). You kiddies are so predictable it is hilarious!
$C: [redacted]
$C: Congrats, your forum is now beyond just non-transparent garbage, a rally for the admins' agendas. Keep it up.
$C: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA FUCK YOU SPEZ HGAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
$C: There is soo much disinformation on what people are talking about regarding the pro/con for "net neutrality". Essentially the FCC is removing the title 2 regulatory framework and adding a few tweaks to the current regulations, they are not 100% scraping it. Most of the "fear" out there is completely untrue/false

FCC document for those who actually want to read it ( good to educate yourself of what the actual proposed changes are, it's nowhere near how terrible people are making it seem to be), lots seems pretty good: https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db1122/DOC-347927A1.pdf
some things that jumped out in the new regulations:

FTC Privacy Regulation, sec.177 Restoring FTC [Federal Trade Commission] jurisdiction over ISPs will enable the FTC to apply its extensive privacy and data security expertise to provide the uniform online privacy protections that consumers expect and deserve.651

p.82 (Transparency) The FTC’s unfair-and-deceptive-practices authority “prohibits companies from selling consumers one product or service but providing them something different,” which makes voluntary commitments enforceable.502 The FTC also requires the “disclos[ur]e [of] material information if not disclosing it would mislead the consumer,” so if an ISP “failed to disclose blocking, throttling, or other practices that would matter to a reasonable consumer, the FTC’s deception authority would apply.”503

p.83 (Throttling) Many of the largest ISPs (Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, Cox, Frontier, etc.) have committed in this proceeding not to block or throttle legal content.507 These commitments can be enforced by the FTC under Section 5, protecting consumers without imposing public-utility regulation on ISPs.508

Section 144, p.85 (FCC invokes Sherman Act Antitrust Laws) Section 1 of the Sherman Act bars contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade, making anticompetitive arrangements illegal. If ISPs reached agreements to unfairly block, throttle, or discriminate against Internet conduct or applications, these agreements would be per illegal under the antitrust laws.518

Section 145. P.86 If an ISP that also sells video services degrades the speed or quality of competing “Over the Top” video services (such as Netflix),526 that conduct could be challenged as anticompetitive foreclosure.

--------------------------
Those who fear content blocking or paying priority, keep in mind that blocked content is currently permitted under NN provided it is not anti competitive in nature, this does not change with the revisions. (Some ISPs currently provide family friendly content in the US by blocking adult content). They also are not allowed to charge extra for access to content as that is also anti-competitive. 

ISP who do not have large backend pipes can prioritize traffic by ensuring ping sensitive traffic (online gaming) routes faster then windows updates/video buffering/torrent traffic that can be delivered a few hundred miliseconds slower with no adverse experience on the user end.
$C: Has anyone realized that net Neutrality was enacted unconstitutionally to begin with, which sets a very scary precedent. The only way to do it correctly is to repeal it and allow congress to pass it and the president to sign it. 
$C: Meh
$C: You want net neutrality in place because it allows you to continue to control the narrative you want. To censor thoughts and opinions you don't like.

Anything you support, I know I'm right in opposing.
$C: #Papa Pai remains victorious. 

WE DID IT REDDIT!
$C: WHY DO I EVEN FUCKING BOTHER!?!?!?
$C: > organic takeovers

lol whatever you say
$C: For the record this is the outcome I wanted. Sorry. 
$C: So now that my life is gone does anyone know good place to train as an assassin?
$C: Rather than discussing here like a fucking retard, why not raid them? Campaign against them, at a revolutionary level. Not this petty red reddit and all.. 

$C: [deleted]
$C: Anonymous lurking from government IPs should be banned, and accounts using reddit from a government IP should actively have reddit gold. This would ensure the future success of reddit and improvements to their infrastructure.
$C: Reddit neutrality..
$C: You post this like you didn’t work your ass off to tip the election for Trump. Elections have consequences beyond your favorite team winning genius.
$C: You don't give us neutrality.  I don't want you to have neutrality. 
$C: 4 out of 5 of the voters were appointed by Obama. How did this happen?!
$C: Shut up /u/spez, you are a cuck.
$C: Back to hellscape of pre-2015 internet my god
$C: i'm literally shaking.
$C: The net was never neutral to begin with, or else Daily Stormer's fate wouldn't have been left up to a handful of companies to decide over it.

This is a beautiful day. Eat shit, you free loaders, for your bandwidth prices are about to go up.
$C: You keep on keeping on Republicans! 
$C: Net Neutrality exists due to a combination of, how the internet was designed, America's love for free speech & consumer pressure.   

As we will see in the days to come,  Net Neutrality will exist fine without Title II.    


$C: For who? I love it!
$C: Maybe you guys should have doubled your upvote bot farming budget....to spam more subs with.
$C: You people never learn. 
$C: I'm glad that the rest of Reddit can experience the censorship that the admins throw at us.
$C: Net neutrality was not repealed they just eased some restrictions. A lot of confused people here.

$C: Haha serves you right wingers right. Democrats win this one.

All of you people screaming about contacting your representatives are fools. They don't care about you. They don't care about your opinion. The news is out, the American Public can be taken advantage of by their elected officials because we the people don't have the fortitude to do what's necessary to stop them. Do you know why protestors in the 60's got things done? Because they fought back. They forcibly entered and occupied government buildings. They didn't stay in designated protest zones. They tried every peaceful means at their disposal to fight and when met with fire, they fought it with fire. All law flows from violence and not all violence is evil. How much more will they take from us before we pick up a weapon and fight back? Do you even care as you sit in the drive through of a fucking Starbucks? When is the line crossed? How do we look our children in the eyes when we won't take chances and fight for them as their future slowly turns to sludge and their digital slavery looms on the horizon?  

I’ve been an American for a long time and I have felt disgusted by a lot of the things our country has done in the last 20 years. Endless wars, failure to embrace clean energy at the expense of the planet, torture, black sites, environmental disasters that could have been avoided, the list goes on. However, I have never been ashamed to be an American until today. Not ashamed at the disgusting, greedy, corporate shills who conceal themselves as representatives. Not ashamed at the vindictive masses who continually put them back into office solidifying the view around the globe that American’s are fools. No, Im ashamed in myself. Ashamed that I, we, let it get this bad without a real fight.  We all need to do some soul searching tonight and ask ourselves what would it take for us to use violence to repel an insidious threat that means to destroy our civil liberties and enslave our children. Is there anything? If not, what does that say about you?

Its time for a Revolution. 


$C: Its honestly not that big a deal. ISP's will begin ripping customers off, and some other ISP will go "hm, if I don't rip them off, they'll choose me instead" 
$C: Most of these people here don’t know what Net Neutrality actually is. They see the memes and they start repeating what the memes say. A lot of what people are arguing about net neutrality is completely fake news. The removal of Net Neutrality benefits us as consumers. Companies, like Instagram, actually prefer the removal of Net Neutrality. The fact that the government itself wants to take their hand out of the internet should open your eyes. Read up on the subject...
$C: We still got cracked apps we gone be okay everyone 😂
$C: So I guess since we have this big crowd of people in here rallying for fair, equal and neutral treatment, the Reddit admins are going to apply the same logic to /r/The_Donald now?

It would seem a little hypocritical not too.

**EDIT: GUESS NOT, WHAT A SURPRISE!**
$C: Maybe sitting in front of a computer posting links and memes anonymously does NOT WORK for our form of government. In short all the cat videos and funny old timed pictures of parents diverted you all from what matters . I blame the millennial generation of focusing on things that are meaningless . 
$C: You guys LOST! Net Neutrality REPEALED!

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAH!

All that fear mongering over nothing. Cry more, crybabies. Nothing will change.
$C: ITT: People who are scared they will be treated the same way they treat conservatives, game over fags
$C: Serious question... why do people guild /u/spez? It’s not like he doesn’t already have more features available to him then gold would allow, I know the point of gold is to help with server costs, but wouldn’t it be better used going to another user? The money still goes to Reddit anyway.
$C: /u/spez, the shillest of shills
$C: Good deal. The current set up of the net is very poor with literly two company’s using 50% of the usage. They should pay more. Google already filters and is a form of censorship. Good riddance. 
$C: I want NN repeal, so go F yourself in the A, spez.  You don't speak for the entire userbase of this website so quit trying to brainwash
$C: Net neutrality is socialism for the internet, sort of like saying we need market equality aside from already in place regulations, or Obamacare for health insurance...it’s a joke
$C: Enough with the stupid protests.  
$C: Hahaha fuck you all! Adios NN 
$C: Net neutrality is gay, and I'm glad they got rid of it
$C: I hate black people
$C: I'm glad this shit is finally over. Maybe now I won't be fucking spammed with stupid net neutrality posts everywhere I go!
$C: The FTC is now going to pick up where they left off in 2015. Nothing to see here. Do your own research and don't let yourself be confused by the media brainwashed masses everyone.

Edit: did I stutter? F T C
$C: How much are you being paid to push this narrative?
$C: Didn't read lul
$C: It's obvious you are done fighting for net neutrality. Good job covering your ass in the archives so nobody will know how absolutely useless you were in maintaining net neutrality. Fuck u/spez
$C: Net neutrality harms black folks like me.
$C: #YOU DESERVE THIS SPEZ, FOR "THE ALGORITHM"

#NO NEUTRALITY FOR YOU FUCKO
$C: lol fuck you /u/spez, your Obama protections are done. The leftist government wont be locking up dissidents. Your dreams and goals are over. The push to federalize the internet is **DONE**


SUCK MY DICK FAGGOT!
$C: If net neutrality were kept, would we be able to prosecute /u/spez for stealth editing users posts, or is that something we have to just put up with when an SJW baby has access?
$C: Stop censoring T_D spez you massive cuck
$C: The repeal was great.
$C: “I’m so outraged because someone told me to be outraged!” - Reddit 
$C: *We’re not done shoving our opinions down the throat of everyone who uses the site to fear monger baseless claims about the effects of net neutrality, as we slowly kill this site more and more

FTFY

Spez: Bring on the downvotes sheep
$C: Add it to the list of things redditors failed with their activism.

- Ron Paul

- Bernie Sanders

- Hillary Clinton

- Net Neutrality

I think everyone can finally realize that reddit doesn't have any actual power. It feels that way to the people who use this site because it's designed to reinforce the prevailing view of the users. It feels then that the entire world supports reddits position's when in fact, most people don't.

As for a free and open internet, that is what reddit wants. Free for them. They don't want to have to pay to support any of the infrastructure that they have made their money on. They don't want anyone else to have a say in what is seen. Only reddit, and Facebook, and Google should be able to censor content as they see fit.
$C: WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ANYMORE YOU IDIOT
$C: Our country is finally getting back on track and you fucks want to ruin it. That's a shame
$C: [deleted]
$C: LOL, "free and open" yet you exclude very popular subs from hitting the front page. Good job talking out the side of you're face. 
$C: what is awesome about all of this is, nobody cares what any of you think about NN.
$C: Tell me why I should care about the free speech NN affords me when I'm being stripped of free speech my megasized sites, INCLUDING reddit. 
$C: Womp womp
$C: but muh phone calls
$C: Hey maybe if you get rid of all the *LITERAL NAZIS USING YOUR WEBSITE AS A WHITE NATIONALIST PROPAGANDA TOOL* We'll support your causes 

Until then you're just another asshole eroding the moral character of the world by trying to get rich off the racist diaspora caused by shutting down coontown and stormfront so go *FUCK* yourself and your shitty radicalization website.  

Clearly the net doesn't deserve to be saved when it's so FULL of nazis
$C: Jesus it's like Y2K hysteria all over again. Chill out. It will be fine.
$C: Oh screw off Spez
$C: Why don’t you use your energy to improve the site on mobile instead. 
$C: The sky is falling! The sky is falling! 
$C: [deleted]
$C: What was concerning is that Reddit is supporting the Net Neutrality Regulations despite the NNR's complete opposition to real Net Neutrality as a concept.  

The belief that NNR will bring about Net Neutrality is mind boggling.  

It's like you folks don't know who Tom Wheeler was before Obama appointed him to chair the FCC.  Wheeler plowed through the Net Neutrality Regulations keeping them secret until they were voted on.  

Two commissioners then issued dissenting statements against Net Neutrality Regulations explaining how NNR ___CANNOT POSSIBLY___ bring about the desirable condition of Net Neutrality.  

But people get caught up in celebrity and the herd... 
$C: OMG THE INTERNET IS GOING AWAY!!!!
$C: Ahh, delicious tears. You're all a bunch of babies, keep reeeeeing, we'll keep winning. lol
The internet was fine before 2015, it was just an Obama ploy for government control.
$C: Hahahahahahahaha hahahahahahahaha hahahahahahahaha hahahahahhaha suck it /u/spez . PAY
$C: lol you lost
$C: Awwww.... A billion dollar company (Reddit) tried corporate propaganda and failed..... Shill harder next time!
$C: [deleted]
$C: but the Internet was free and open before these regulations, in fact... free from gov't interference 

thanks to Chairman Pai, we'll have a true neutral internet that encourages the competitive spirit that the Internet thrives from, prior to the oppressive Obama regulations
$C: weird, I can still access reddit netflix and youtube and no requests for extra charges or "exceeded bandwidth" or throttling or anything else really.

Bet it's gonna stay that way too. Amazing how life goes on just fine without some useless federal government regulation.
$C: Maybe if this place wasn't pro-censorship of things you don't like, I'd take this seriously. As it stands, I actually trust the people running this place even less than the current FCC.
$C: When harvey hit Houston my family told me to fill up and buy canned goods. 

I live in Oklahoma City...

I didnt do either and it turned out fine...

People are retards...

Businesses are not going to allow something to cut into their profits...

Chill out...
$C: I am so happy that the repealed the rules. My business is going to take off now, with major profits expected for the next 8 fiscal periods. 

Thank you very much to the FCC for understanding the needs of business that serve the general population. Now more than ever, consumers will have more choice. 
$C: Fuck off spez, this happened because of people like you.
Reddit is the most censored website in the history of the internet.
$C: What's gross is reddit is the home of the largest alt-right hate forum on the internet as well as the largest anti-NN forum, that same alt-right Trump toilet.  Reddit giving a platform for these people is a big part of why we lost this fight.  That moronic Trump sub is the largest supporter of Pai I see anywhere online. 
$C: Who gives a fuck, seriously, let's move on
$C: I own a lot of shares in ISPs 

tl;dr this is good news!
$C: Says the one who anonymously edits comments of users that disagree with him... such a hypocrite.
$C: You plan to allow The Donald to the front page? I mean, you're all about the free internet right?


Piss off.
$C: So much for differing points-of-view, freedom of expression, opposite  opinions and diversity-of-thought on reddit.  I’m absolutely sick and tired of being bombarded by messages of how to think on the subject matter of the FCC and net neutrality.  Reddit’s attitude is  pompous, ponderous and outrageously  frustrating. Grow up reddit!!
$C: Don't get your way.

Call in a bomb threat.

Stay classy, Leftists.

EDIT: Wow, look at all these wannabe terrorists downvoting me.
$C: all you people crying over this like it's the end of the world lol and you still want to censor people too
$C: man I love seeing you faggots cry
$C: You want the government to fix and control the only free flow of information the people have.  Are you nuts?  What the heck are you thinking.  What a failure our education system has become!   100,000. Of school depth for this! We should all demand a refund! I'm sure global warming is real and all we have to do is pay more taxes and the temp will go down. Stop listening to the libtard bubble and think for yourself! 
$C: Dumbass violent extremists threatening peoples lives over an internet order. 
$C: How am I on reddit?  My ISP is not charging me extra to come here.  Let me try posting and see how much that now costs.

Oh look.  That didn't cost anything.
$C: Freedom wins! 
$C: *has to pay more for internet*

Yeeesss so many librul tears! 
$C: [deleted]
$C: get fucked Reddit, Facebook, Google, etc
$C: Eat shit spez you cunt. spez sold politics sub to media matters. That little shit is deceiving all of reddit.
$C: This has been the most insane, lied about story I have ever seen. Net neutrality is a fraud. Just look on Twitter at how many people who think the internet won't exist after today (because of all of you fear mongering about something that would never happen).

Net neutrality created burdensome regulations that fix a problem that doesn't exist. They were enacted in 2015, and the United States had some of the fastest internet speeds in the world. Much faster than Europe, which has similar regulations (similar to net neutrality). These regulations stifle the very innovation that made our internet fast in the first place, and is a huge burden on increasing internet speeds in the US.

People have especially been duped on social media, where this smear campaign has led to many people supporting net neutrality without actually knowing what it does, and that it is unnecessary. Surprise, the internet will be the same tomorrow and in the future!
$C: Wait a goddamn minute...You mean to tell me bitching about it on the internet HAD NO EFFECT?!? 
$C: r/nonetneutrality
$C: > going to continue fighting for the free and open internet

By wanting the United States government to control and regulate the internet. The irony. 
$C: ITT, not *nearly* enough mentions of Title I vs Title II and FTC vs FCC regulation.

ITT also, a lot of chicken littles that are positive Net Neutrality is super important, yet aren't informed enough to explain Title I vs Title II and FTC vs FCC regulation.
$C: Thanks super jew
$C: The vote just passed and my CNN live feed is getting throttled.
$C: [deleted]
$C: aand nothing changed. All the whining for such a long time for nothing. 
$C: Good.
$C: I think the isps should be able to charge content providers more according to the amount of traffic they get but they shouldn’t be able to give consumers premium packages and such
$C: Ya'll are fucking insane.
$C: Fuck u/spez
$C: Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!  Suck it!
$C: Neutrality... Like how the news, politics subs are run here?! LOL
$C: I hope they start with you Reddit retards.
$C: God it is magnificent watching Reddit meltdown over another fake crisis. See what happens when you cry wolf on every issue for two years? Important people stop taking you seriously. 
$C: Another Obama era overreaching regulation that stifles growth has been eliminated!!  Thank your Congress and the FCC for starting to get America back on track.  
$C: "Organic" 

Ell Oh Fucking Ell, /u/spez.  When /r/the_donald legitimately was popular, you nerfed it to make sure wrongthink didn't make the front page.

But when your precious net neutrality (which you only care about because it benefits your business) gets questioned, oh look, hundreds of posts from subreddits with followings smaller than 1000 subscribers suddenly get 50,000 upvotes: TOTALLY ORGANIC.

spez: I'm 100% sure the downvotes this comment is getting are TOTALLY ORGANIC too.
$C: Reddit is against censorship?  Hilarious.
$C: Reddit should be hel accountable for promoting the spread of hysteria and hate towards members of FCC and politicians that are fighting to overturn Obama's internet rules.

If anything happens to those people I hope spez and Alexis end up in jail.
$C: Whay if you are happy with the result? What can we do to make sure net neutrality stays dead? 
$C: Yes you are liberal retards.
$C: Yeah, thousands of morons on reddit crying and making shit tier memes was highly effective activism as we all found out. Lmao 
$C: [deleted]
$C: thank God for this vote. the last thing i want is the FCC be the end all/be all of my Internet. quit the fear-mongering. the internet was not a lawless wild-wild west in 2014 and prior like you're making it out to be. there's still rules. there's still regulation. the government just has less of a role.

the insanity of advocates for net neutrality is reaching y2k levels of irrationality.  
$C: Spez is a cuck
$C: Oh noes, did your attempt to clamp down on and further discriminate against conservative thought on an already lightly regulated medium fail? You'll just have to find another way to silence dissenting opinion. I hear Google and Facebook are your best hope to take up the mantle of thought policing.
$C: spez is a cuck
$C:  luckily none of this shit will affect me at all since I live in Australia. Cant wait for this dumb as fuck net neutrality spam to piss off from clogging up Reddit
$C: Glad it was repealed. All data is not equal. Fear-mongering loses, and reason prevails. 99.9% of you will forget about this in 2 weeks and not notice any difference at all. 
$C: Lol.... So many liberal tears.

Every down vote on this comment is a communist crying right now. 
$C: Regulation is Aids. It's not the Governments place to regulate the internet. Don't like the practices of your provider? Switch.
$C: [removed]
$C: FYI everyone who supports Net Neutrality -- you are on the same side as Spez. If that doesn't concern you whether you are on the light or dark side of things, well there's no hope for you. Or us.

And not just on the same side as Spez, but a side he is actively campaigning for. Spez is not a good guy. He's a censor and a shill. 

Be careful with who you follow.
$C: This was a win for free speech, anonymity and privacy.

Fuck title ii.  

Resume your fight for legislative protection of net neutrality.  Good luck.
$C: Thank GOD the good side won and the internet is kept F-R-E-E.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Poor spez. Bet your wife tonight is gonna dump all her boyfriends as punishment for losing Reddit money.
$C: All the companies I despise (Google, Amazon, Reddit, Facebook) seem to be strongly in favour of net neutrality...I think I'm going to have to research it a bit more before I sign on just because the name is well-marketed and well-lobbied.
$C: Dont worry nothing bad will happen.
$C: Question for u/Spez:

Why is it not ok for ISPs to censor but you literally censor conservative speak and the_donald on a daily basis?
$C: ##BAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! 
$C: Good. Fuck Net Neutrality. Find a new way to make money reddit. 
$C: I wanna shoot my spez all over your tiddies
$C: You're just salty because you aren't going to get your corporate welfare for streaming video content on your site. 
$C: Crocodile tears from reddit and spez. You do not believe in a “fair and open” internet. We know what you did to T_D and its disgraceful. 
$C: As long as the liberals are upset, I'm fine with it. After the tax cut, I hope their social services are cut as well. 
$C: Give up libitards, you lost and it's amazing!
$C: Dear Spez

Get fucked. You had a helping hand in making this happen and allowing Trump (and other republicans) into office. You are cancerous to society. When the revolution comes, you will be found guilty for your crimes and you will be hung.

Eat shit and die. 
$C: Net neutrality didn't go anywhere. Just Title II. And we're all going to be better off because of it.

I'm glad to see this change and looking forward to the innovation that follows.
$C: I can’t wait for the announcement about preserving unborn lives because /r/announcements is political 
$C: Soon the internet will be returned to its free, pre-2015 state. The fight may not be over, but freedom lovers will always be there to oppose reddit's fear mongering and propaganda.
$C: We need to spend less time on the computers and phones, anyway. Take the opportunity to get away from social media, YT videos, reddit, ebaumsworld, forums, and blogs. Go outside and explore. Take up guitar. Get a kayak or a mountain bike. Check out a local Jiu-Jitsu academy. Read all the books you've ever wanted to. Ajit, verizon, and all the rest are inadvertly *saving us from amusing ourselves to death* - it is time to get back to really LIVING.  We know something is wrong... all of the social media, phone checking, mindless scrolling... it is numbing us to emotion. NO MORE. BREATHE IN THE FRESH AIR AND FEEL THE RUSH OF LIFE AGAIN. GET BACK THAT CHILD LIKE SENSE OF WONDER AND MYSTERY THAT STILL BURNS DEEP WITHIN US. GO FORTH AND LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST.

$C: I hope the ISP's throttle and gate you fucks. For over a year this site, Facebook and YouTube have censored, shadowbanned and outright deleted conservative content.

I am so happy Ajit Pai took a giant dump on your ohso precious net neutrality. If you want an open and free internet you should have stayed true to Schwarz's principles but no, you just couldn't because you had to be censorious little shits to T_D.

Face it, you lost the moral high ground and now you have paid the price.

I hope this site and the internet dies now, maybe something better can be built in the ashes. You want a reason for why NN died? Look in a mirror.

spez: the ISP's want to steal a few more shekels from my pocket. You and sites like this act like dictators on the internet. I hope you both, content providers and isp's, DIAF

$C: [deleted]
$C: Can anyone one of you people explain to me how the internet before Net Neutrality (2015) was so bad? 
$C: Yeah save net neutrality so we may continue slodding through our miserable existence distracted by lying to each other and propagating mistruths, it'll make the owners more money. Ajit Pai is trying to liberate you 
$C: Very disappointed in Reddit for taking a political stance against /ourguy/ Ajit Pai. Personally I'm glad the FCC is taking the brave action of quarantining Americans away from the rest of the world's internet.
$C: Look at this shit you guys, he puts the communist hand symbol behind the reddit logo in his announcement, he's not even trying to hide it anymore it's just full on agenda

Edit(Spezzit): https://duckduckgo.com/?q=communist+hand+symbol&t=ddg_android_hs&iax=images&ia=images
$C: What are you going to do about redditors that call for the murder of Ajit Pai?
$C: Reddit lost. That's a fact! 
$C: https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNetNeutrality/
$C: By "not done fighting" you mean pushing botted threads up to the top with the same script?
$C: Glad its gone 
$C: You guys are hysterical Chicken Little’s. Bravo Ajit, get the government out of regulating everything!
$C: Loool....... Awwwww. The poor little snowflakes writing all their letters couldn't get the government to grab control over the biggest medium of free speech. 

Tear.
$C: Net Neutrality got repealed? I’m happy. Suck it salty Redditors.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Maybe if your version of the "free and open internet" included conservative viewpoints, you'd of had more bipartisan support. Hard to be motivated to "save" the environment that's been taking a shit on you since Gamergate.

Not a fan of this vote, but it does open the door to the FTC bringing anti-competition lawsuits in the future. I'm done supporting your way of handling this, due in no small part to the way you've treated me and people like me for the last 3+ years. 

I'm fine to let conservative lawmakers take a crack at fixing our ISP issues rather than impartial fuckwits like you who've abused your position to suppress us "undesirables".

Eat a dick /u/spez.
$C: Fuck off.

All we've gotten under the past two years of net neutrality are websites censoring people with conservative and right leaning views. Including THIS WEBSITE which has partaken in the censorship.

*"Free and open internet"* my ass.
$C: Net neutrality didnt exist before 2015 and everything was fine, stop with the fear mongering!
$C: Yeah! I can’t wait for Net Neutrality to BE REPEALED. Thanks MailMyGov! I’ve mailed my gov letting them know I HATE NET NEUTRALITY. I want it gone.

Fuck u/spez.

(Let’s see if spez edits my comments again)
$C: lol bye americans
$C: Yaaaay fewer Americans on the internet
$C: Was supporting net neutrality included in the $2.8 million you got for selling /r/politics?

$C: deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.7877  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/97615)

Typical liberal hypocrisy: Rules for thee, but not for me. You lost again u/spez, go cry somewhere else.

$C: Net Neutrality is a joke. 
$C: Why is my internet still working? I thought it was the end of the world with this decision? Why was my internet working perfectly fine before Net Neutrality ? Calm down kids, you can't freak out over every single thing, tends to lose it's effect.
$C: MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM LET THE SALT FLOW!!!!!!!!!!!! DING DONG NN IS DEAD!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

EDIT: MMMMMM YES SO MUCH SALT!!!!!
$C: Hey /u/spez, maybe you should maintain neutrality on your website before getting up on your pulpit you cuck 
$C: From the guy who actively edited users comments to suit his delusional narrative...
$C: Thanks God the government got their tentacles of our internets
$C: The guy who admits to editing redditors' posts is complaining about net neutrality...
$C: Does this mean that everyone can stop spamming propaganda now? 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Hey /u/spez If you preach open Internet and neutrality, then why don't you put your actions where your mouth is and allow The_Donald to appear in Popular and not discriminate against the sub?
$C: So does this mean all the annoying net neutrality posts on every single sub can stop?
$C: [deleted]
$C: You idiots. Government was going to do what it wants. We sent going to change anything. At this point ive seen so much about it that if I was in court id vote against it just to piss you guys off.

$C: Wait why can I see this? I was told that after Net Neutrality was gone, the ISPs would ruthlessly censor everything they didn't like!
$C: Ajit Pai has shown how racist the left can be when they actually stand something to lose.
$C: How about you start with a neutral *website* that doesn't condone astroturfing, partisan campaigning, and generally sucking the established media's dick?

What, you couldn't get a celebrity to come do this during an AMA? Did /r/politics not spin up enough of a mob for you this go around? David Brock didn't get enough funding?

Fuck reddit, and fuck you.
$C: OH NO, ISPs WILL NO LONGER BE PROTECTED FROM ANTI-TRUST LAWS! HOW HORRIBLE

GOVERNMENT MANDATED MONOPOLIES ARE A GOOD IDEA, TRUST US! FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE SAY SO! WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY CARE MORE ABOUT, THEIR ABILITY TO HAVE A MONOPOLY OR YOUR BEST INTEREST?!

$C: Wow, adding a filter to his skin to make him darker and look dirty. Maybe try keep racism out of the criticism, can you manage that u/Spez?
$C: Fuck you you fucking pussy. Fuck your liberal agenda.
$C: I'm glad they repealed it because I think it will benefit society in the long run.  
$C: A win for the free market. Sorry, socialists!
$C: I'll be attending a party tonight to celebrate the results of the vote. Very happy with how today turned out.
$C: “Net neutrality needs to stay so we can continue censoring right wing subs!” - reddit
$C: I logged in to laugh at you. Your ploy to censor free speech was foiled and now you must get over it.
$C: The day the_donald is freed from censorship and allowed back on the front page is the day this issue can be addressed. In addition, there needs to be more transparency to address the problem with astroturfing/paid content posting
$C: please just let net neutrality die, thank you.
$C: Luke dies, Rey teams up with Kylo, Yoda appears, Resistiance is almost defeated, Leia lives
$C: Plebbit killed /r/jailbait, Pai killed NN.

karma.
$C: Don’t try to jam this leftist shit down my throat
$C: update3 (10:13AM pst): The FCC votes to repeal 3–2.

#BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

#FUCK YOU SPEZ

$C: If you guys believe in a free an open internet, why do you silence conservative voices and run the whole website like a bunch of snowflakes?
$C: u/spez is a filthy statist
$C: [deleted]
$C: if reddit cares so much about neutrality why is the_donald always censored ? 
$C: Oh shit guys, I just tried to post something on Reddit and discovered I'm shadowbanned because I'm not a low IQ leftist.  Is this because we lost the net neutrality guys?!?!
$C: YASSSS net neutrality is finally gone. im so fucking happy rn
$C: You guys are misled so easily. Fucking sheep. NOT ALL DATA IS EQUAL AND YOU MUST REALIZE THAT, that is why they will repeal net neutrality.
$C: You nuggets act like ending net neutrality will lead to widespread censorship, when the technical oligarchs are already doing just that against conservative opinions.
$C: Who really cares, 
$C: Fuck you, u/spez.  You're the censorship master.  Fuck Net Neutrality.  Deregulate the industry.  Competition will keep the internet free.  
$C: Due to the incessant spamming and mindless regurgitation on Net Neutrality of the hive mind, I will be calling my representative today to ask that they REPEAL Net Neutrality. Why? Because you all won't shut the fuck up about it and have put it in my face so much that I resent the whole movement.

I'll be eating popcorn as you all throw tantrums when they repeal it.

TL;DR: Hey reddit, stfu on NN and other political movements, it reeks of shillbot desperation. Just say no to spam.
$C: The salt in here is delicious, I give it a week before every single one of you forgets all about it and moves onto the next thing that is going to bring the end of the world 
$C: [deleted]
$C: this shit's hilarious. Net Neutrality is dead! I can use the salt generated by /u/spez to keep my beef edible for weeks! I love it! 
$C: Ha! Cry, liberals, cry!
$C: Why is this a bad thing? This is awesome and it will be great for America.
$C: Pai is just a proxy for the people who appointed him and approved his nomination.  If we don’t like this decision, then we have to let congress know in 2018 and the president who appointed Pai in 2020 how we feel with how we vote.
$C: [deleted]
$C: We're not in a democracy anymore , Dorthy
$C: I feel sick. This doesn't feel very much like America anymore.

Edit; America is still my home and I'm gonna fight for the betterment of it, not give up. Yes, we have a lot to do. 
$C: > Does democracy and public outcry mean nothing anymore?

Did it ever?

$C: > Does democracy and public outcry mean nothing anymore?

Correct.
$C: At what point do we form a litteral mob?
$C: To paraphrase your current president:

"Nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don't know."
$C: This really makes me question capitalism in general. Capitalism is in control now, 100% don't ever forget that.
$C: Welcome to reality. The people are ignored in favor of corporate interests. Congress don't give a shit bout you. All you can do is learn enough about pirating to bypass the bullshit ISP's will enforce.
$C: Democracy doesn't work because it has never existed....except for in Switzerland.  But their population are not ignorant like the American people are.
$C: As an Eastern European who's very used to this kind of stonewalling by politicians and their friends at this point... it's so weird to see Americans go through it. This sucks.
$C: we are not a democracy.
$C: Democracy in the US is dead.

As if that wasn't already evident.

There no longer exists a government of the people.
$C: From what I've read on another board, some of the comments that were published were faked. Supposedly, some posters on that board saw their names attached to positive comments about ending net neutrality that they never made.(Let me stress "supposedly."  Because their real names are not shown on the board, I have no way of verifying.)

In any event, I don't know how much good contacting one's representatives in DC does. With persistence and maybe tons of signatures on a petition, we *may* be able to change votes on a city council. I don't think we change a thing in DC. 

Our politicians are corrupt and do fine, in or out of office. Money talks; public opinion walks.
$C: America is officially gone. 
$C: One of the keys to the Republican platform is less government regulation and that's exactly what this is. Republicans won the majority of seats pretty much across the board. It seems democracy worked fine. If people want more government regulation of the internet then that's what they should vote for.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Of the people, for the richest 5%, by the richest 5%. Checkmate.
$C: It doesn't mean shit without power. And sadly we are not organized enough. 
$C: Start small local and state government, you get enough States writing there own laws governing internet as a utility then the federal government will follow. Take the power back locally, don't wait for the federal government to catch up.
$C: Can I ask where the source is for those numbers please? 
$C: The United States is not effectively a democracy or a democratic republic. 
$C: This is What I'm feeling, but put much more elegantly. I'm so ashamed of this government in general...
$C: >Does democracy and public outcry mean nothing anymore?

Democracy is is the fiat currency for violence. Since we disconnected the currencies backing of violence and accountability there's no threat value worth considering. Voting and democracy are empty threats against who would take all that is left undefended. Everything is undefended.
$C: Ever heard of protesting?
$C: Physical violence is the next obvious step. Just saying. 
$C: of course we were ignored.  that was the entire point of his appointment.  blame whomever appointed him.  
$C: > **We the people spoke, and we the people were ignored**

Downvote me to Hell all you want, but isn’t this expected?. What do you think would happen when the internet cries out BUT DOES NOTHING OUTSIDE OF THEIR COMPUTER SCREENS.

All of the angry tweets can get dismissed as easily as someone closing their browser window. Because that’s all this is, Someone screeching on the internet until you turn on the mute button. And it’s like nothing was ever there.

You want to make a difference?, Use the influence to organise a mass protest. Get a date down and start rallies in major cities across the US. If this act has such a negative response, this shouldn’t be a problem. I think 500,000 people outside the Whitehouse, with full media coverage, sends a better message than meme reddit posts. 

Alas, the internet will never get off their asses, so the FCC have already won.

$C: Believe it or not Reddit doesn't represent the entire public. Reddit has an extreme liberal bias (as you can see by the CEO spez). Young and and millennial is the core of Reddit, so don't try to pretend it's a representation of the entire public.
$C: I think you're confusing 'Reddit' with 'we the people'.  Sorry, the're not one in the same and I hope to GOD they never will be.  I can't imagine how shitty things would be if the population in general participated in the kind of self-righteous circle jerk Reddit gets up to over net neutrality.
$C: Ummm...that is because you and everyone else that supports net neutrality doesn't understand it.  When not one single doomsday prediction you dumb fucks made comes true, will you finally shut up about NN?  Or will you still fight for it then even when you know it is not needed?
$C: Awww did they ignore the same whining liberals who have been throwing a temper tantrum for over a year now? Sad.. 
$C: > We the people spoke and we the people were ignored.

Because you're idiots.

Government mandated monopolies are stupid. None of you simpletons actually knew what you were talking about, you just did what Zuckerberg and Google told you to do...you know....because they are so trustworthy.

Turns out, a bunch of sheltered liberal numale tweens don't know a fucking thing about business or the real world. Shocking eh?

Every single thing you morons said about net neutrality was absolutely wrong. Remember the fast and slow lanes on the internet before 2015 and net neutrality? Oh right, THERE FUCKING WEREN'T ANY

Again and again and again reddit loses, and you little fellas never learn
$C: We the \*bots\* were ignored

Why should the fcc care what Russian bots have to say about American processes millions and millions of your comments were by not a changing a little bit from comment to comment 
$C: The majority of comments just proved that the average dissenter lacked even a basic understanding of what the repeal entailed or how it impacts the web.

Spoiler: reddit and conde nast stand to lose money because of this. We, the web users, will not even notice a change.

You have been used to fight for the profits of billion dollar corporations. Well done.
$C: >  and public outcry 

You're probably one of the people threatening violence whenever someone you don't like is invited to give a speech.
$C: I watched it this morning, total mockery. They think all we care about is cat videos, Instagramming our food and being able to order fidget spinners while completely ignoring our concern for the price of the internet. They mocked activists while simultaneously misleading the rest of the population on why this is an issue. Total slap in the face. 

They even did the Harlem shake, this is how out of touch the FCC is with the real world.

Pai is such a pretentious jackass. 
$C: Oh god, that video. Someone should create r/smugcringe just to post it there.
$C: How can we go about doing that? Are there any businesses that we can boycott or some way to hurt their profits?

God, I hate that smug little douchebag. 
$C: It shouldn't be too surprising.  He's one of those special people that actually get off on being so thoroughly disliked.
$C: It really shows his priorities. I’m disgusted this is the man that we have in charge of the FCC. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Is there a r/FuckAjitPai yet.   
Or a r/FuckTheFCC  

Edit. Yay
$C: True. Like meeting him outside and beating his ass. No one considered violence? We can continue to ask them nicely forever I suppose as they rape our wallets and government. 
$C: I can't be the only one who notices the resemblance of his name to "A Shit Pie". Because that's what he is.
$C: Do we take up arms?
$C: https://youtu.be/LFhT6H6pRWg

Link for anyone curious
$C: [I fixed his smarmy little video.](https://youtu.be/FzulhVjliU4)
$C: He mocked everyone who sent in letters, emails, comments. It's time for the 99% to do something about this ass face. 
$C: Why hasn't anybody unearthed anything on this guy? With all the sexual harassment outing that's been happening lately I can't possibly fathom that this guy, who openly mocks his opponents, hasn't done something wrong. I'd actually bet money on it. 
$C: Unless your name starts with "Billionaire", you were never going to make an impact with these assholes. The only way Net Neutrality is going to live now is if it is enshrined as law. So get on Congress's ass about it.
$C: Assassination is next.
$C: That guy has the most punchable face I've ever seen
$C: That video is the “let them eat cake” moment. I don’t know how he could imagine it would go over well. 
$C: That really sucks guys, I hope you that his can get all of you together and fight for what is yours. A free and open Internet.
$C: link?
$C: And I'm guessing with them we  can't do anything to kick their asses out? 
$C: Hm
$C: Maybe there's 1 or "2" amendments that could be used to stop these people?
$C: https://imgur.com/a/JgkUc 

Mutha fuckin devil ears to laugh at all of us in plain sight. 
$C: I mean even the image on this post is mocking him, so it’s not like he’s just doing this unwarranted.
$C: link of the video?
$C: He also made a video with the DailyCaller ...oh isn't that a Proudboy nazi backed website?...oh that's right it is. Google it "dailycaller ajitpai video"
$C: I can't believe what I was subjected to, in the 2 hours I sat there listening on. The ridiculous logic behind their Aye votes, the fact that Pai is a fucking tool and the joke that this issue was seen.

Unbelievable. Just...unbelievable.
$C: Thats alright. Where does he live and does he like to jog?
$C: First step, if you can afford to bail out on Verizon Wireless as a customer, do it and jump to T-Mobile. 

$C: Err, you mean that wasn't fake?
$C: At this point what does it matter? Efforts didn't work before and sadly they won't work post-mortem
$C: I don't think he was mocking anyone. I think they tried to make it all hip and cool... Which it was not at all. 
$C: It'd be amazing if Netflix, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, redddit, etc all shut down for a day to say "no actually you can no longer do those things."
$C: Why should they care what the people who are whales in the scheme of things care you'll keep being a whale and the average person will happily pay extra for Netflix or YouTube buffering 
$C: Link?
$C: Maybe because this movement deserves to be mocked?
$C: Keep crying libtard 
$C: He did. That in my book is enough for hundreds if not thousands to stand outside his house, follow his car, go to his office, publicly fucking shame Him, abuse Him, make that shrills life a living fucking hell.

I don't know the facts about NN, I do not even live in the USA. But this kind of power that the rich have has to stop. More so that pretentious fuck had the audacity to make that video. If he was from Ireland, we would have all but lynched the cunt by this stage. 
$C: We should start killing people. Sometimes violence is the answer
$C: No. It shows what a joke you all are. Calling government controlled internet “free internet” is hilarious. Now there’s reports of a bomb threat. Way to keep losing. 
$C: Maybe it shows how blind to the issue you are.






Guess what, nothing is going to change. Your not gonna "pay for comments" like Reddit wanted you to believe.








Ajit pai is a person like us, and jokes around. 
$C: I just want people to stop spreading the obviously false rumor of how Ajit Pai raped and murdered four teenage girls in 1998. He would never do something like that. Ajit Pai did not rape and murder four teenage girls in 1998.
$C: Have you tried thoughts and prayers?
$C: Look at the comments above.  

“Sign up for paper statements ...that will show them!”

“Pai raped and murdered someone in 1999”

This is Reddit. You all deserved to be mocked. 
$C: It was fucking savage on his part lol. All it did was make this website more salty and all these redditors do is say "fuck ajit pai!" like that's gonna do anything. Or make more memes mocking him. It all doesn't really matter in the end.

there really isn't much left to do. these calls, emails, whatever the fuck every main sub was promoting - did nothing in the end. 


$C: Reddit deserves to be mocked. Outright lies and stupid hysteria for going back to 2015. Stupid.
$C: Its amazing to me that the church of Scientology is far more effective at getting shit done than the entirety of the internet...
$C: YES. There are several lawsuits planned, and Congress should pass a law that protects NN.

The majority of Americans support NN, so pressure your representatives to pass an actual law!
$C: Thank you, good reminder that the fight is never over.
$C: Donate to groups actively working on lawsuits. Does anyone have a list? The only one I know is ACLU. 
$C: Knew it would pass. Ajit literally keeps telling y'all he doesn't give a shit nor does he read your comments.
$C: We haven't done enough to fight.  Protesting, letters, all that has been ignored. Completely. The only thing that will get results are concrete actions.
$C: /r/substratumnetwork 
$C: Americans can bypass Congress and push a bill into law on their own. Never forget that. If we start collecting signatures now, we could have a law in place within 2 years. 
$C: The American voice obviously doesn't matter. What's the point?
$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh8sVHb5oOA
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves. Violence was part of equal rights for Race and Gender. Violence stopped the Nazis and saved millions of lives. Violence created our Country and maintained it. It is a tool and in some situations it is the best tool for the job. This is one of those situations because all other avenues have been exhausted and the powers of the government themselves are being abused So there it is. There is the solution.     

I know you all won't listen and I know we will lose the internet because of it. I hope your ego and pretentious morality was worth us losing one the greatest wonders of the human world. My resentment is no longer just for the corrupt human garbage that pushed against Net Neutrality, but also now for all of you who allowed it to happen just because you didn't want to get dirty to clean up the filth.    

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: “Don’t let this be a defeat”

It’s a defeat dude, Because you wanted a different outcome.
$C: You guys couldn’t even keep trump. Stfu 
$C: >Just because the FCC has gone against the wishes of the country 

The wishes of the country? Don't be delusional
$C: translation: "I really don't like it, but Verizon is paying for my new swimming pool so...maybe someone else will pick up the slack.  but seriously guys look at this sweet new pool."
$C: The rules getting repealed were the FCC’s regulations, but if Congress makes their own law then the FCC can’t repeal it.
$C: Because he knows they won't.
$C: Who was it?
$C: [deleted]
$C: Yes! And Ajit Pai made her statement into a “joke” 

What a fucking piece of shit he is!
$C: > Mignon Clyburn

Upvote her https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iDjrenk5KE

edit:  not sure how youtube's algorithm works but if upvoted enough, hopefully it will send this strong message to the trending page there.  
$C: She actually gave me hope.
$C: She had the best speech and literally got laughed off the stage by these disgusting fucks
$C: Anybody got a link for the West coasters who slept in?
$C: Seriously. I loved her speech so much! 
$C: There are good people in the world. They should be commended.
$C: I was lucky enough to have her come speak to my class last year and she's an awesome fucking person
$C: This video here shows who Ajit Pai really is. The response and laugh he gives after Clyburn's speech just proves the fact that he is a corrupt piece of shit that doesn't care about anything but $$$. Think about it: Over 80% of all Americans, the very creators of the internet, and people like Mignon come together in front of him and all he does is to chuckle. I'm not even American and  his astonishingly unprofessional behaviour made me want to punch him. 
$C: Man, when this all goes to shit, she's gonna be sitting in the room like "Mmhmm....I told y'all so..."
$C: Love the way she ended her comments with a quote from Pai
$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh8sVHb5oOA
$C: The dumb bitch who claimed women can't get an abortion if net neutrality is repealed?


Every day the left just gets more and more retarded. LOL
$C: 99% of reddit has not clue what Net Neutrality really was. It was a kickback to the large tech companies and it saved them billions while pushing the cost to all end users. There never was a "fast lane", it was just a term created by Google, NetFlix, PornHub to scare people into backing the bill that saved them lots of money. 
$C: What slimeballs honestly...
$C: The fcc is now Comcast, color me surprised
$C: Its not over yet we have another chance. Congress
$C: You should ask Reddit about all that Sprinklr.com money it's getting in exchange for handing over your meta-data.
$C: They are choosing to let the FTC take over. They are a much more powerful organization.

Also, the rules in Net Neutrality that STOP throttling and data discrimination are NOT in effect. They only would go into effect if the internet was regarded as a utility, which it's not.

So, to everyone scared: We are and have been living WITHOUT Net Neutrality protections this ENTIRE TIME. 
$C: Here’s a mod of /r/nottheonion admitting to removing pro-net neutrality comments: https://i.imgur.com/mAlEf32.jpg

$C: if our district has no opposition candidates, what can we do? i'm not politically inclined so I'm not going to run my own campaign :P
$C: Seeing "The Honorable Ajit Pai" makes me want to vomit.  Thanks for the info.  I will remember this when the polls open.
$C: I have left reddit for [a reddit alternative](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditAlternatives/wiki/index) due to years of admin mismanagement and reneging on transparency promises.

As an act of protest, I have chosen to redact all the comments I've ever made on reddit, overwriting them with this message.

If you would like to do the same, search for "Overwriting and deleting reddit comments."  You are welcome to join me on [a reddit alternative](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditAlternatives/wiki/index)!
$C: They sold out to us.

EDIT: "honorable Ajit Pai" haha
$C: What is this honorable Pai bullshit?
$C: I find it interesting that the wording of the letter implies that these representatives believe that, by repealing the Obama-era regulations enacted to preserve net neutrality, they are preserving a free and open internet from the outmoded telecoms that own and operate the ISP’s.

Interesting because these motherfuckers, by and large, were all well aware that it literally runs contrary to the stated goal of the repeal. Meaning that the existence of this letter almost certainly is only to serve as a smokescreen to cover their tracks when the public starts screaming for blood. With this letter than can tell their less informed constituents that they were duped into supporting the wrong side of the issue, by being misinformed of both the intent of the FCC, and the intent (and letter) of the original regulation. 

Politicians lie, oftentimes months, even years in advance. Let’s never forget that.

But there lies the rub. What if they’re sincere? What if they truly do believe that the repeal of net neutrality was intended to restore and preserve net neutrality, because they were actually misinformed?

In that case, we can’t admonish them for being intentionally evil plutocrats with only dollar signs in their eyes. We can, however, refuse to allow representation from men and women who cannot separate fact from fiction, who are intellectually incapable of researching existing fact, and politically blind enough to refuse to acknowledge the will of those they represent.

The entire point of a representative government, is to bring the will of the majority in any given area to the national stage and give it voice. But that point has been long forgotten, and these representatives have proven, irrefutably, that they are representatives of the corporations, and not the collective will of the American people.

Now that the FCC has repealed net neutrality, we must shift our focus from fighting Ajit Pai, and onto supporting the coming court battles against his actions. We must focus also on removing representatives from power that have proven to be ignorant of the will of the people, and replace them with representatives that will stay true to the will of the people.
$C: [deleted]
$C: They are all Republicans.

As is Trump's Administration.

As are Pai and his two peer members who voted to gut Net Neutrality.

This is a Republican voter problem, not a "some congressmen" problem.  We're getting what we deserve, so it's time to turn that pattern around.

. . .


By contrast, this is what happens when not-only-Republicans are in charge:

https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/25/technology/path-clears-for-net-neutrality-ahead-of-fcc-vote.html
$C: It's funny that my representative from Idaho auto-responded with the following in December 5th despite signing the letter supporting Pai.

"
Thank you for contacting me regarding net neutrality regulations.  I appreciate hearing from you and having the opportunity to respond.

While this issue is a complicated and technical one, I have long believed that the Internet must be kept free of regulation, taxation, and other forms of government intervention.  The Internet has had a profound impact on our society both socially and economically, and the lack of taxation and regulation on the Internet is one of the reasons it has grown so dramatically, improved our economy, and created a forum for unfettered commerce and ingenuity.  

In recent years, some have expressed concern that a phone company, cable company, or other network operator could block access to certain Internet sites based on negotiated business relationships that could allow them to favor select sites over others.  Net neutrality is the general principle that owners of the networks that compose and provide access to the Internet should not control how consumers lawfully use that network, and that they should not be able to discriminate against content provider access to that network.

As you may know, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted on February 26, 2015, to regulate broadband Internet service as a public utility under Title II of the Communications Act-a legal designation that currently applies to firms such as traditional telephone companies.   The new rules, approved 3 to 2 along party lines, are intended to ensure that no content is blocked and that the Internet is not divided into pay-to-play fast lanes for paying Internet and media companies and slow lanes for everyone else.  Broadband internet providers could now face regulations similar to those the federal government imposes on telephone companies.  

On May 18, 2017, the FCC adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) to reexamine the 2015 Open Internet Order.  The NPR returns broadband Internet service to a Title I classification and seeks comments on the existing rules governing Internet service providers.  On November 21, 2017, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai released the draft order related to the May 2017 Open Internet NPR.  The draft Order is currently being circulated among the commissioners, and the draft is tentatively scheduled for consideration by the commissioners at the FCC's December 14, 2017 open meeting.

Should legislation addressing this issue or other matters related to the FCC come before me during the 115th Congress, you can be confident that I will keep your thoughts and concerns in mind. 

Once again, thank you for taking the time to contact me about this issue.  As your representative in Congress, it is important to me to know your thoughts and opinions about issues affecting our nation today.  I also encourage you to visit my website, www.simpson.house.gov, to sign up for my e-newsletter and to read more about my views on a variety of issues.


Sincerely,


Mike Simpson
Member of Congress "

He lost any chance of me voting for him in the future. 
$C: How is anyone meant to read that chicken scratch?
$C: Damnit. I called that fucker Wilson yesterday. Gonna call today like “Wtf, bro?”
$C: Oh good, Oregon's Greg Walden right at the top.

Hopefully everyone in Medford, Bend, and Hood River enjoys watching your small businesses get locked away in the dark recesses of the internet! 
$C: when those elections come around I'd love to sponsor a billboard in each of their states/districts showing the facts of how they behaved on this issue
$C: Marsha Blackburn is legislative prostitute, took nearly a million dollars in ISP money to destroy the internet and to sell out the American people. Fuck her
$C: I plan on trolling @AjitPaiFCC and his donkey teeth on twitter throughout 2018 and beyond.
$C: This is how it's done.

I'll vote for which candidate supports my views best. All of these people no longer hold my best interests in line. Fuck tribalism and party lines.
$C: Hopefully more people will get out and vote in 2018.  453 seats and 33 congressional seats are up for election.  I want to see a lot of these corporate shills lose their jobs.  I always considered myself independent but this last election I went straight Democrat and plan to do so for the foreseeable future.
$C: >Letter to the honorable Ajit Pai
>honorable
$C: Right.
$C: Most of these signatures look illegible...
$C: I like that Ajit is labeled as "Honorable Ajit Pai"
$C: This is so important. 
$C: Wonder if he’s on there, he does chair the—

Yeah, he wrote the damn letter. Fuck you greg Walden.
$C: Thank you Nevada for not giving up our rights
$C: I don't understand....some of these people got hundreds of thousands of dollars? Is this common? Is this free spending money or where does it go??
$C: You're talking to people who voted for Roy Moore even after knowing he was a sex predator, it's pointless.
$C: Joe Barton that stupid fuck. I'm going to have a lot of fun campaigning for the Democrat to replace him next year. 
$C: Of course Cathy McMorris-Rogers voted to repeal Net Neutrality. I hate her so much.
$C: My hs crush's dad is a senator, and he's on the list. I'm gonna grow a pair and make her my gf so I can meet her father and ask him why he's a corrupt motherfuvker.
$C: Guess this will be my first duty to the country since I became a citizen last January. Finally get to vote.
$C: Well... Looks like it's time to write my SC reps again, this time to thank them for making it clear who I **won't** be voting for next election.
$C: What if there opponent is a pedophile?
$C: > support their opponents in the 2018 elections - even if that means you have to vote for someone from a party you hate

Over one issue? That's not how that normally works.
$C: I know I'll get downvoted, but net neutrality shouldn't be the deciding factor when choosing a representative. Definitely important, but that's just silly to encourage people to vote for "opposition" candidates (edit: SOLELY) because of it.


Edit: controversial lol. Who will win? The voices of reason or those of emotion?

It is Reddit, so my hopes are low...
$C: Why can't mass shootings target these people instead of innocent civilians, it's sad there's no justice
$C: I suppose we should also remember if the internet prices end up lower and more people end up with access we should acknowledge those that supported the decision today, right?
$C: TIL some subreddits constitute the will of the people
$C: Called my rep to no answer

I assume they're hiding or they're swamped 
$C: I thought the issue with this is that it STILL has to be signed in by the president, and based on party alignment, i highly doubt he will do anything but veto the proposed overrule.

I’m with you all on contacting our reps and asking to enact this process, I just want us all to be mindful of the actual process that takes place.

Also fun fact- Newt Gingrich was the one who proposed this act in 1996 to stop regulation during the Clinton administration. How ironic if it came back to bite republicans in the ass now? Crossing my fingers reddit.
$C: Dude, this tactic didn't work before, why would it change now?

It's time to take to the streets, fellas.
$C: I would hope an organization putting their effort into fighting anything would please *do some research* before posting bad information.

So, positing first that this is actually a "rule" (I'll come back to that), let's start on your claims.

> it can only happen within 60 legislative days of the order going into effect.

That's false.  The CRA clock starts when the rule is submitted to Congress, per your own link:

>Under the CRA, before a rule can take effect, an agency must submit a report to each house of Congress and the Comptroller General containing a copy of the rule...

This is why many Obama-era regulations are at risk of being overturned by use of the CRA - [they were never submitted in the first place](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-gop-regulatory-game-changer-1485478085).  Realistically, they should never have gone into effect... but that's a beast for another day.

Now let's look at your actual text:

>I support Title II net neutrality, and I urge you to use the Congressional Review Act to pass a “resolution of disapproval” reversing the FCC’s December **vote to repeal the Open Internet Order.**

Emphasis mine.  And this is why this entire point is a fool's errand.  There is no more rule.  There is nothing to be submitted.  The rule was created during the Obama FCC.  This vote repealed it.  And note, again from your link:

>hat is, the rule would be deemed not to have had any effect at any time. Even provisions that had become effective would be retroactively negated.

That's the problem.  There is no more rule for the CRA to impact.  Which gets us to the only ways this can be undone at the federal level.

* A new FCC vote to restore the rule (which would then be subject to the CRA), or
* Normal legislative activity

The second one is the key.  Live by the dictate, die by the dictate.  

Both sides are so dug in that the other side are not just wrong, but inherently evil, that they won't bother trying to sit down and work out *anything.*  Net neutrality could be resolved fairly easily with both sides winning.  Make a law that makes it illegal to limit access to any legal source of information at the contracted general speed, but allow companies to offer *faster* access at the desire of the customer.  So I get my normal speed anywhere I want to go, but if I want to get even faster speed so I can watch all the Hulu I want, I can pay extra for that.

But no.  Let's continue the constant spam-laden fight another month or fifty.  I'm sure it'll work this time...
$C: > Congress step in and restore net neutrality via Congressional Review Act (CRA). 

Is there a number less than zero that would properly represent the chances of a Republican congress overturning a decision by their colleagues voting on party lines?
$C: If someone makes the image a t-shirt, I’d totally buy it 
$C: Your URL at the end has one too many T's! 
$C: Texting battle isn’t working 
$C: So many of these mailboxes were full or they weren't accepting messages or calls
$C: The congressional review act requires the president to sign off on it. So it is typically only used for the first few weeks of a new president, to undo the actions of the last president.
$C: How about a bill that as a individual I could push through my local and state government?

We have a army of people from multiple States and cities they can't win all the battles at all the locations we push a unified bill that works for state and local governments. How long can the government hold out if every state passes it's own form of a local internet utility bill.
$C: The cookie cutter letter they are sending is what is being ignored though, isn’t it?

$C: WHO IS PAYING FOR ALL OF THIS!???? AND TELL u/spez that we want Reddit neutrality too.
$C: This didn't work before why the fuck is it being used as the tactic again? It's a pathetic one. We need a better one. Fucking anything. Write and call text? They don't care. 

The world must be laughing at us. 

Edit: this is the bullshit some people are talking about. Who the fuck is downvoting this stuff? It's the fucking truth. Is your head in the sand or something? Are you Russian troll bots? The calling and texting and letters DIDNT work. That's a thing that didn't work. So when someone says maybe it's a shitty idea, maybe it's worth while thinking about a new one. I know I am. But no. Head in sand and down votes.

Edit: I don't have the solutions or suggestions for a better tactic but you have to at the very least point out the problem with the current half assed attempt at a solution. It's childish.

Go on, continue downvoting. Make sure to put your head back in the sand afterwards. Morons.
$C: With all due respect I would hesitate at the concept of giving congress _more power_ in lawmaking. 
$C: They haven't voted yet
$C: This needs to be higher up. For so many voters that aren't internet savvy or use a computer everyday, they won't ever figure out what all that NN huff was about, but they will still pay. 


$C: Network engineer here.  Yes this is *exactly* how it works.  Just wait at see what happens to bitcoin traffic.
$C: This is so fucking important. 
$C: Hey,

I 100% believe you, can you give me the sources on when ISPs have done this before? 

I have some people I need to run this by, and when this happens I want to be able to say why im right.
$C: A boiled frogs situation. I feel like if people keep reminding everyone about net neutrality it would at least help people stay aware of these changes. Maybe.
$C: This exactly. I bet they don't try changing a thing until after the midterms, so Republicans can run on NN being a big 'ol nothingburger, and then if Dems do win they can argue "why bother signing NN into law now, obviously they are being responsible without it."

It's sick how easy it is to predict conservatives, all you have to do is think "what is the most awful, depraved thing they can possibly do" and you'll get it right every damn time.

Don't ever think "nah, even the GOP wouldn't sink that low" because you'll look like a fool.
$C: >The ISPs will win unless we continue to fight, but I find it hard to believe that we can maintain this anger for so much longer.

That is very true, there is a good chance the FCC will put these regulations back into place in a few months or years due to increasing tension and unrest.
$C: They have to tell their entire userbase if they were throttling connections by law. It wouldn't be a secret. If Comcast started throttling connections to reddit Verizon would say we won't do that and get nearly all the Comcast user base.
$C: Also, we don't know when the 2017 rules will go into effect, in 30 days, 60 days, or what. When asked during the meeting, Ajit said he didn't know the timeframe. Until they do, the 2015 order is still the law of the land.
$C: Also as the isp's turn you into a product and charge netflix a fee to access you, you might see netflix up their price to accommodate that fee and you would be mad at them. At least that's how the average person will see it.
$C: This this this 
$C: Do you know who’s likely to file suit? I lost my connection during the bomb scare. 
$C: THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE:

In any given situation, there are certain strategies that will be effective, and certain strategies that will be ineffective. The ISPs want this. The FCC wants this. The federal government wants this. 

However, we will only lose if the collective we allows us to lose. If we all really want net neutrality, we need to show them that we aren't messing around. The only way to show them that is to threaten to cut your ISP subscription on a certain date if they do not abandon this agenda, and if they do not abandon the agenda, you and about 10 million people need to cancel their subscriptions immediately. Think about it. That's $600 million every month we maintain a boycott. But we need numbers in the millions. We need those numbers to place their names on a list as a petition and a pledge, a *true and honest pledge* (not like that worthless DARE pledge you took in gradeschool).

[So, to save Net Neutrality, you'll have to DO IT YOURSELF! Sign the petition to pledge to boycott Your ISP, AND request the resignation of Ajit Pai!](http://chn.ge/2zgjW8o)

I hate to say it, but if this doesn't work, you might as well consider your Net Neutrality gone. The petition to the White House is nice, but it lacks a pledge and a call to action. Beyond that, Trump appointed Pai. This is Pai's entire purpose.
$C: How the hell does Pai expect us to bow down to his decision when he openly mocked us in a video? Hell no in that we are ever going to listen to someone who mistreats us to get what they want...
$C: When is congress going to vote?
$C: But in the interim we will get raped by the telecoms. And the interim could be years. I'm trying to be optimistic but I just can't afford what's about to happen. I very well may have to give up internet all together.
$C: It's just another piece of a long line of evidence that these people do not represent us, are hostile terrorists to us, and we need to arm ourselves and take back the government for the people so that we can institute changes and actual representatives for the people.

How many more times do you people need to be stabbed in the gut before you actually do something tangible instead of easily ignored internet protest?

Thank's for keeping it so I have to pay for a plan I can't even afford with a sky high deductible, fuck head.
$C: FCC will win. 


$C: His whole argument was about ads like we don't have ad block, and like they don't plan to sell all our data for targeted advertisement. Yeah that's not more creepy than random ads, Ajit.

He's an ex lawyer for verizon and one NN repeal goes through congress(god i hope not) i can see him going to verizon with a new salary. legal way to bribe someone in our country
$C: I don't see how he can be so nonchalant for such a hated person. He doesn't seem to care that 90% of America hates him. Maybe we haven't been doing a good enough job making him the face of anti net neutrality?
$C: >  free of charge

The ISP are going to eliminate any of this. They might start charging per click.

$C: That moment when the microtransactions in gaming break the 4th wall.

$C: > We all know that the things that were so simple to do at one point, are suddenly going to become more difficult as companies put things behind pay walls.

That pay wall could be on either end, or likely both.

**Apple**: We want to offer FaceTime to all of our users as part of using our hardware.

**ISP**: Hold on there Apple, you need to pay us to allow connection to your servers.


**Product owner**: Sweet, my phone has FaceTime. I'll use it to video chat my mom.

**ISP**: Hold on there, shit stain. You need to purchase the "Apple package" to download songs on iTunes, to access iCloud, and to use FaceTime. That will be $45/ month to access any internet and $10/month to access any Apple services.

**Product owner**: I don't want to do that. Let's see who my other ISP options are.... shit.
$C: It's really hard to see /r/The_Donald's opinion on anything, since they believe trolling (like Mr. Pie's video) as a good thing . Shouldn't politics be all serious matter, I mean a joke here and there is fine, but isn't the whole thing a bit too much? If you visit the Subreddit you know what I'm talking about . It's more of a joke-cultists board than a Subreddit supporting the president .
$C: I'm down for a good ole fashion boycott of all ISPs who start creating tier based services. I understand businesses probably won't be able to do so, but individuals surely can.
$C: We need to make Pai pay for this.
$C: > It's clear he thinks that those of us who were fighting against him are basically mindless idiots who only use the most basic things the Internet offers.

Well....he is not wrong.
$C: [deleted]
$C: This is right. Checks and balances are a part of our system. It's beyond disappointing that Chairman Pai has committed some serious process fouls in his disregard for public opinion on this issue. But both the courts and Congress have the opportunity to change this, and that is where we're turning our attention. Like u/spez says, this is going to be a longer fight than we had hoped, but it's not over. They think we'll give up. They don't know us very well.
$C: Exactly! Washington State preempted the vote by saying if Net Neutrality is revoked, they will challenge it. Encourage your representatives to do the same. https://twitter.com/GovInslee/status/941075518924865536?s=09
$C: HAHAHA the courts....wait didn't Trump install a ton of federal judges? Hmm.
$C: You guys couldn’t even keep trump out. 
$C: lol not with a Republican majority
$C: You know the republicans have a simple majority in both houses of Congress right?
$C: too bad Republicans are loving this shit.  They own House and Senate.

Fucking bury anyone who supported this repeal.
$C: yeah done that already all of them were like fuck you I do what I want one has already said he isnt running again the other two wont be reelected for a few years now so fuck our state I guess
$C: Calling congress, especially republicans, is pointless. They are already paid for. The only thing to do is wait until November and vote anyone that has a (R) anywhere close to their name, out.

Then rinse and repeat for November 2019.
$C: "Scream into this sock and toss it off a bridge for all I care" 
$C: It isn’t Pai who needs to be held to account.  We need to pressure those who appointed him and approved his appointment.  He was appointed by the US president and approved by the Senate.  He is simply the executioner carrying out what he was chosen to do.

We need to let congress and the president know that this will matter to us during each of the coming elections.

$C: I say Americans should take a note from the Scientology handbook and flood the FCC and Pai with lawsuits.

$C: >... and holding Pai responsible.

This is important, but not quite enough. Ajit Pai is a puppet, and directing *all* blame to him is part of big telecom's strategy. If it can be explicitly proven that he has been receiving undue external support or that he has a stake in big telecom, the real culprits can be brought to light.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I think if your AG isn't listed as one of the 18, urge them to join.
$C: Too late, discouraged. Protests? It's more financially beneficial to them to just ignore it until we can't afford to protest anymore and need to go back to work.


No matter how clear the record is on any matter, this... denialist sort of mentality has let people across all matters get away with the most corrupt horseshit, with simply saying "Nuh uh, nuh uh, fake news, blah blah blah".
$C: that tweet by Senator Warren doesn't exist anymore. What did it say?
$C: Hey that's my district rep! Ted Lieu is a boss.
$C: Holding Pai responsible should be the least of our concerns.  We need to kill the career of everyone involved even those who didn't give enough dissent.  If we just whip the whipping boy the plan went off without a hitch.
$C: Can the next dem chairman re-instigate it?
$C: Good god, if I ever have to write a speech can I hire you?
$C: I just sent a letter to all my reps stating that the SEC filings show no justification for repealing these regulations and a list of businesses and previous cases of anti net neutrality practices.  Hopefully this is further ammunition in addition to this.
$C: They may have won this battle, but no one and nothing can protect them from the wrath of the people.
$C: Good luck organizing now when the avenues by which you can are subject to close. You can't SMS everyone in the country.
$C: I’m not discouraged I just know that in 2020 it’ll all be restored faith in humanity will be restored because I know we will have democratic control in the White House Congress and the Senate people are sick and tired of the Republicans and using God as a crutch is not going to happen anymore I’m a Christian and I am sick and tired of Republicans and their control people because of God God gave everyone a choice these people who voted for trump have been brainwashed and it’s our job to educate them. 
$C: Thanks
$C: You assume they give a damn what you think.  You aren't their voters and they stopped representing everyone.
$C: Just like everything that Obama did (good!) that Trump is trying to reverse, everything that Trump is doing (bad!) will be reversed after his impeachment and total upcoming disembowelment of the Republican party and it's seats (it's going to be laughable).  Guys like Bannon must be shitting their pants knowing that in less than 2 years their going to pretty much lose all influence.  No house.  No senate.  No executive.  The legislative is becoming progressively more liberal.  It's the last hurrah for the Republican party and everything that it's members represent.  Which is not about big government.  hahaha
$C: I think Americans need to start voting with their wallets. There needs to be a boycott of any provider which supports non net neutrality. When they start losing money, they will change their tune. 
$C: > The flood of protests received by the FCC 

They don't care. 


No really, they don't care. They giggle with every email to the FCC complaining. 
$C: > This is important.

It couldn't be less important.  This fight was lost last November.  'The internet' isn't going to intimidate Ajit Pai.  It's not going to damage Ajit Pai in any way, shape, or form.  Ajit Pai won, got what he wanted, and is laughing at you.  He will go on to a lucrative career banking more in a year than you'll make in a lifetime and living a happy, fulfilled life.  
   
Sorry, reddit.  Game's *long* over.  Maybe next time don't assume that whining will be enough and actually vote in your self interest.
$C: disgruntled people + 2nd ammendment + Pai home dox = revenge
$C: Don't get discouraged? We lost and they don't care about us.
$C: > It may be the key to undoing this, and holding Pai responsible.

lol
$C: You raise a ton of great points but my god learn how to use a comma
$C: It's sad... But we lost our battle
$C: so net neutrality was saved or was it repealed
$C: There is zero chance a court will overturn the decision aside from a liberal judge or two at a lower court level. The initial regulations are an illegal overreach by the Obama administration. Net neutrality is good in theory, but it must be done the proper way, though Congress.

As for all the comments by brainwashed people who just buy whatever they are told attacking the net neutrality repeal, who cares? No government agency is required to act based upon whether mindless sheep send more comments or not.
$C: So when the scenarios of throttling, censoring etc etc never happen what then?

Individual users will not be affected. The web companies like Conde Nast that own reddit may well take a financial hit though. Good thing we arranged all this "organic activism" right?

Are the pieces falling into place yet? Do you grasp your role in this game?
$C: No. We don’t negotiate with terrorists. 
$C: if these "packages" become a thing - I'll be dumping them for 56K Dial-up connection for free, and below that - a 56K Dial-Up BBS Administered and Run by Yours Truly - FUCK the FCC and FUCK Ajit Pai.  I'll pay for the extra phone line before I pay for one of these idiotic ideas.  Man, now I'm glad I kept my vintage PCs.
$C: It doesn't work like that. They make the service anyway and after 2 years they say "Hey, if you don't pay us, we'll replace you with Digg".
$C: Nope....I'd rather just stop using the internet because of all the bullshit that just happened
$C: They will all pay. When the decision is between having a business and not having a business, the choice to pay is the only choice.
$C: Nice try Comcast.. I SEE YOU
$C: It might not be that simple. If a site, Reddit in this case, doesn’t promote the desired right wing extremist political views it likely won’t be able to get in the fast lane at all. Making money is just a bonus. The primary goal here is to censor information the current administration does not want Americans to see.
$C: Lol Comcast

$C: We don't have to sign any of those deals.  It's very clear that all of the solutions to 'call your congressman' are not going to work.  They have rarely ever worked in this environment.

What has worked is actually doing something.  Creating a work around the ISPs is the solution, for which some people have already taken action.  

We can't retrieve this using the ISP's net anymore.  We have to create our own now.  I just hope it doesn't take too long for people to realize this.

https://github.com/skycoin/skywire
$C: Non-throttling isn't a thing. The ISP's will most definitely throttle access to sites that don't pay
$C: Not publicly until their pockets are lined.

$C: Bahahahahha you guys were played so hard. Ironically there’s been articles about cities “creating a new version of net neutrality” by starting their own ISP.... which is the entire point of getting rid of it in the first place to create more competition! To allow others to have a chance to create their own! And they’re reporting it as if people are “sticking it to ajit pai” by creating these new forms of internet. Bahahha

$C: These fucking psychos in the thread who actually think this is a good thing are blowing my mind 
$C: It's truly incredible that three people can determine such an enormous  decision that will affect all Americans.
$C: I'm so fucking sick of the phrase "heavy handed"
$C: The one dude with white hair even lied that it helps consumers to remove Net Neutrality
$C: > Companies can't be competitive if we regulate them!

You mean the 2-3 options for the majority of the country? They can't compete? There is no competition. NONE.

They are already making money have over fist. What about the money they received to overhaul our infrastructure? Did they ever do that? Fuck no.

Fuck this shit. I'm so fucking pissed.

$C: Nah, it happened just as openly right before everything cratered in 1929. History repeats, my friend.
$C: The major argument for repealing seems to be "let's go back to bipartisan and how the Internet flourished before 2015.  Things were fiiiiine then and I'm sure the telecoms won't try to screw people in the future if we go back to the way it was!"

It's complete crock.  The law was a reaction to recognizing a vulnerability  in the system which could screw the consumers.  It was the government protecting the rights of the people against corporations.
$C: Trickle down economics is a joke. That's just code for "bigger CEO bonuses"
$C: > Damn it's sickening to know this level of corruption can happen openly in 2017.

Thats been the Republican way since Obama.  The crazy part is they're open about the corruption, yet people still vote because (R) in the name.  Maybe these voters deserve this, so they can finally wake up to the congressional leaders fucking them.  

Sucks we'll all have to take a hit, but if it opens some eyes maybe its worth it.....

$C: Things weren't fine before 2015. The only reason net neutrality became a thing is because telecoms tried to block access to competing services or in some cases things they didn't like.
$C: What worse is this may affect future elections, not just the president, everything, any web-site with criticism can just be slowed to a half and effectively down with a few clicks, the ISP's will have a huge amount of power, waaay too much, and of course, they will be bribed to shit.
$C: Since our voice doesn't matter maybe it's time to consider violence?
$C: It's like shooting yourself in the foot. They're not going to get super secret internet. They'll get fucked with higher fees and shitty service like the rest of us. And so will everyone in their family.
$C: How is bribery even fucking legal? That's like mafia level shit which the government probably is just a giant mafia at this point.
$C: which is funny. after NN passed, my internet providers started competing and started offering better speeds. Because they have to provide faster access to compete. Now they can charge you more for less.

Just look at how they treat POTS lines in many areas. A lot of areas have wiring that goes back almost 60-70 years, yet charge insane rates and get paid by the government to upgrade and maintain those lines... that they do not maintain. I left verizon years ago because they refused to fix our lines going from the street to my house. got a VOIP provider and never looked back.
$C: People seem to forget who put these three republicans in the FCC. Never forget how the orange muppet time after time again does everything he can to screw over the American people as a whole.

Never forget that "they are all just as bad" isn't true. Had there been three Democrats, there wouldn't even have been a vote in the first place.
$C: Why not just call Pai directly? Call him so much his phone slows down and he feels what it's like to be throttled and email him?
$C: Mostly because we can't just kill them anymore unfortunately, damn civilized times
$C: I'm so confused... both sides seem to think they're fighting for internet freedom (or at least have they facade), and half of them are saying paid prioritization will happen, some of them say it will not, and some say that it is bound to happen, so it is okay that it does.

 All of this leads me to believe that there is a fundamental misunderstanding in the implications of this ruling, even in the members of the commission itself. They're basing their votes APPARENTLY on murky and contradictory facts.
$C: > "Companies can't be competitive if we regulate them!

Right.. competition. Because there is any competition for internet providers in most of the country. Even if there are three or four in your area, normally, at most, two are worth looking at. And even then most of the parent companies are the same. There is no competition, and deregulating sure as fuck isn't going to make some suddenly pop up. 
$C: > Damn it's sickening to know this level of corruption can happen openly in 2017.

It's funny because there seems to be a lot of Americans out there that have and are still fighting to get ALL the guns. They claim it's their right in case they want to stand up to a tyrannical government. I don't know if they have to be tyrannical to justify that clause/statement, but now may be a good time to start getting ready to march with those weapons you keep insisting you keep. 

The government, more specifically the GOP, is straight up fucking up this country and nobody is going to do anything about it. It's not just the current administration that started it, but they sure as shit are acting on a lot of the stuff they couldn't get away with previously. Petitions, letters, and really anything peaceful left to try is just a waste of time as they are NOT LISTENING TO THE PEOPLE for whom they are supposed to serve. 

I'm just saying it might be about time for those gun nuts to start using their 'power' for something good, like marching on Washington armed. They don't have to shoot anybody, but it's a different show of force from the public that might stand a chance to get through. Stop wasting your time being an internet hero...
$C: Hello, I prefer all corruption to happen openly. Know thy enemy. 
$C: Thats what fucking bothers me the most. Its so obvious and no action is being taken to stop this shit.
$C: I think it's a mistake framing it as interests of corporations vs. people. Weakening net neutrality benefits only a tiny minority, namely; ISPs. Also I haven't seen anyone raise this argument: even if you are an ISP with the biggest heart in the world, putting the customer above immediate profit, now, to stay competitive you will have no option, but to follow those who use the dirty tactics. 
$C: The reason why net neutrality was introduced is because the Internet continues to grow at an exponential rate.  We can't go back to the way things were before 2015, because it's a completely different ball field now.
$C: It's "aye" not "I" when voting. Aye means yes. I means me. 
$C: I saw the other day how much some of the companies paid the congress ppl. In some cases it was as little as $100k... this legislation is worth hundreds of billions. I feel like we should raise the necessary money to pay them off, as heart wrenching as it would be to hand them money to do the right thing 
$C: and out in the open, this isnt like some 3rd world government where its all done behind closed doors either.
$C: I've been a strong proponent of Net Neutrality for a while, but I'm leaning on the side of changing the Title II status, with the condition that Net Neutrality rules are upheld. I think Title II classification doesn't necessarily have a 1:1 relationship with Net Neutrality. I think the bigger problem is that there is not a good classification for the Information service, and I only say this because utilities are allowed monopolies for service.

I think the problem is the same problem we always have in American politics. The argument is one side or the other. What needs to happen is a bill to protect Net Neutrality rules while changing the classification.
$C: fucking classic that it's the women trying to save the damn country, as per fucking USUAL.
$C: How long would it take before it's in effect?? 
$C: No surprise. In this day and age, open corruption has become the norm. Open bribes are the norm. There are no consequences, either from the system nor the population.
$C: I would agree with what was said in the 2nd edit if there was even a choice to make. Where I live I don't get to choose my ISP, just whether I have internet or not.
$C: Yeah, I was really impressed by Clyburn. Her appeal to the internet being weaved so deeply that it’s like the fabric of our society and needs to be protected as our country is, was brilliant. Spot on. Too bad the three assholes who opposed her weren’t listening. 
$C: There should be invetigations and seize all electronic messages and personal communications of FCC official's.If a company like Comcast can Monopolize they way they did n still doing..It really smells fishy..need to find the Money trail.If the FBI can investigate little businesses on similar allegation why can't they investigate FCC the evidence is there and plenty of it.It's just common sense
$C: Don't support bad businesses. If a business wants to throttle your service. Find a competitor that won't. The market can turn this into a win if people will stop appealing to government power and just start making their own decisions about where to spend their money.
$C: [The Revolution Will Not Be Televised...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGaoXAwl9kw)
$C: This just goes to show that America is no different than the corrupt banana republics it props up.
$C: The telecoms will try to screw people over. Net neutrality didn't stop them. Break up the monopolies!
$C: You realise with the removal of net neutrality they are putting in transparency so they cant throttle internet without telling us
$C: >  Just no shame to their bribe taking.

It's the American Way (TM)
$C: That man needs to be assassinated 
$C: They did it for the people. Thank you Pai!!!!!
$C: Well...there is probabaly one thing that this whole Net Neutrality has done good.
It made people aware of what a Horse-shit their government it, it made them realize that their democracy and so-called "free country" is just a facade. They live in a country where a man just laughs off the opinion of 83% of people. 
No one in power gives a shit about the opinion of general citizens. 
At least, it made us realize that we all are second-degree citizens in our own country. 
$C: I hope someone gets shot over this. And I'm not even American. If this happened in Europe someone would already have been lynched over this. 
$C: Pai should be fucking shot.
$C: I won't be the one to do something about it but someone should.
$C: lol well what did the Democrats do when the DNC clearly handed Hillary the nomination?

You say it's sick that corruption still occurs yet what did the people do when the learned the truth about the DNC? Nothing. I have no hope for people to do anything about this because they willingly let Hillary screw over Bernie Sanders who could of easily won against Trump.
$C: It is important to note that there will be no subsequent Evil taking place until 2021 when everyone has forgotten and Trump has "secured" his second term.  That's when the bad things will start happening.  This will allow Trump to secure his third term.
$C: >Agree with me or you take bribes

Lol
$C: > This is absolutely mind-boggling to me. The malicious lies, the no shame bullshitting on how the repeal is not going to matter or even, it is going to make it even better and freer - this is just insane to me.

This is a hallmark of the current administration.  Look at the cries of "fake news" and the insults levied at "academic elitists."  One of our country's parties is at war with the free spread of knowledge and information.  

We need to fight back. 


$C: Pai actually said we would have a “cheaper internet”...how the hell does he suppose that’s going to happen?!?
$C: Put the word out. We hire the clown.
$C: Don't give them any credit. They're far from actual people. Souleless vessels for evil is more accurate. 
$C: The inexcusable use of archaic laws through the excuse of their past implementation is not a new practice. Just look at family courts and alimony/child support system... That shit is so malevolent that it has driven people to suicide. 

My hope is that congress gets their dicks out of their ass in the next 90 days, even though they know exactly what is going on and haven't done hard moves to stop it today. 
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves. Violence was part of equal rights for Race and Gender. Violence stopped the Nazis and saved millions of lives. Violence created our Country and maintained it. It is a tool and in some situations it is the best tool for the job. This is one of those situations because all other avenues have been exhausted and the powers of the government themselves are being abused So there it is. There is the solution.     

I know you all won't listen and I know we will lose the internet because of it. I hope your ego and pretentious morality was worth us losing one the greatest wonders of the human world. My resentment is no longer just for the corrupt human garbage that pushed against Net Neutrality, but also now for all of you who allowed it to happen just because you didn't want to get dirty to clean up the filth.    

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: That is exactly what people say when they want to eliminate the death penalty.
$C: "Malicious lies"?

Reddit has been chock full with malicious lies about how THE INTERNET IS BEING STOLEN FROM US.

Oh wow, we're still on the internet.

It's hard to feel sympathetic with a raging animal horde that has abolished the concept of truth so they can hate and fight more effectively.
$C: Not once did I hear Pai acknowledge the citizen complaints like Rosenworcel did when she spoke at length of missing comments, people having their identity used to voice support for repeal, support from Russian emails...I mean to me it seems clear that 99% of the country could support NN but they don't pay like ISPs do. 
$C: I'm physically sick after watching these overinflated bags of hot air puff around. We as Americans have GOT to get out and vote these shit stains out of their seats. They've made it into an Us vs. Them argument, so let's finally show these bought-out soggy biscuits who actually controls their careers.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I think something that is important to note, is that the commissioners for the FCC are all appointed by the president and approved by congress ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission)). So you can't really vote them out unless you're voting in all the right people for president *and* congress. This "breach of democracy" is bigger than the FCC. 
$C: What really annoys me is that these guys who weren't even elected by us. I don't think that unelected government officials should be able to do this.
$C: My brother and I also found fake comments that support Pai and his agenda. Is there any way, or any where to report these blatantly fake submissions in our names?

Mind you, we are not residents of NY. Indiana actually.
$C: I've talked to my dad at length about this. I didn't start following politics until the late 2000's when things started getting really turned upside down, and as an adult, I had to think about myself instead of my (very intelligent) parents making decisions and voting on what would support me and my future.

The one thing both of my parents have said is that politics has not been this bad in terms of 'what team are you on?', ever. Never once has someone been able to so clearly ignore the constituents they're supposed to represent to such a disgusting degree, and to a large degree get support regardless because it was a GOP move or a Dem move - it doesn't matter as long as "their" party proposed it. I've talked to people that are happy things pass that **financially hurt them, badly** because they think it's funny that it "pisses off the libtards," (or Republicans), and they're generally happy about that. HOW!?!?

Before Trump came into play, the GOP was planning on doing a 'rebranding' with celebrities touring the country to try and lure young people to their party because they could see that their typical supporter was about 60. Then Trump won and they got their puppet. It doesn't matter regarding their voter base anymore because they don't need them. They can cater to their donors, to their bribes, and to their friends. What's sickening to me is that they do it in such a brash, in-your-face way, like they're saying, "We honestly don't care how you feel."

In all honesty, if some of these people are still in their jobs after the next voting cycle, it really shows you the level of ignorance that people choose to have. It takes 10 minutes online to find out how these bills will affect you personally, and now with the 'party over policy' attitude people have, we're turning into Idiocracy.

Our country is a joke, and our government is a joke, and our President is a ridiculous disgrace of a human being.
$C: they're appointed, so they're immune to public opinion. Have to elect a President who will appoint favorable people whenever those current FCC commissioner terms expire. They have no reason to listen to us.
$C: How can we put them in prison for this? There is nothing about this that can be legal.
$C: We need to get the three Republican commissioners faces out there, let the country know who sold them out and get them fired. 

Michael O'Rielly

Ajit Pai

Brendan Carr

Are traitors to the American people
$C: >Well, they did it, despite the fact a majority of voters in either party oppose it. Something akin to 80+% of the population opposes it on the whole.
>

Can you cite a source for the 80% statistic please? It's not that I dont believe you; I just want to be able to point to a document when I use this in future arguments against the repeal. 
$C: Elections matter.  The fate of net neutrality was decided in 2016.
$C: Despite the false claims made by the republican commissioners, I have to say that I am still a proponent of Net Neutrality but I also think we desperately think we need to have a new bill to more officially support Net Neutrality.

However, I am annoyed by the lies from Ajit Pai about not having insight and no control over content provided by big websites. The whole point of an open internet is that other websites can grow and compete to be more fair to its users. And its not like these big websites are doing it intentionally. It is a complicated issue when you are trying to be appealing to advertisers when the content does not work with their content.

We shall see how this plays out

$C: Mike O'Riley mentioned this in his speech by saying that comments weren't used for making this decision so it didn't matter. **IN THE NEXT SENTENCE** he said public forums were not required because we could have left comments.  
  
What a complete shit show. 
$C: can you send me something to send to my representative? 
$C: > VOTE... THEM... OUT.

My father raised me to be a spiritual person - to look on the bright side, look for the good in people, and always forgive. 

But fuck that. Ajit Pai is evil and I wish there were some way to truly make his life suck - I'm talking perpetual identity theft until his house is repossessed and his wife leaves him because he's been having an affair with the local boy scout troop. 
$C: BUT HER EMAILS!!!!
$C: #POOP ON AJIT PAIS DOORSTEP

Daily
$C: Ajit Pai needs to rot in a jail.
$C: Exactly, Next step VOTE THEM OUT!!! 2018
$C: How good are the chances that the democrats will take the house and senate in 2018? Before, I was doubtful, but with the recent election of Jones, now the dems only need to pick up 2 seats for a majority in the senate, that's way more doable, and the last time the dems had the house was in the last midterm of George W Bush's presidency and the election of Obama, and I definitely feel lime Americans are motivated enough to get those republicans out right now.
$C: I will never in my entire life ever again vote for the Republican party. Absolutely _never_. They have proven themselves to be absolutely the biggest pieces of shit in US history.
$C: Will do.
$C: VOTE THEM OUT.
$C: Except they've also worked hard to gerrymander their way to victory.
$C: I wish there was an ISP that stood for us (the people), and somehow allowed the internet to remain the way it is. I'd LOVE if that happened, because then everyone could cancel all payments to the big companies that shoved this down our throats... 
$C: [The Revolution Will Not Be Televised...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGaoXAwl9kw)
$C: You can't VOTE THEM OUT.  Republicans cheat.  They gerrymander, they miscount votes, they make it impossible for people to vote, they own the voting machines which are easy subverted by design.
$C: Never vote them in again. The Republicans are the laughing stock of the rest of the world.
$C: Am I missing something here?
You said it yourself, the votes are rigged as fuck (as seen with the trump thing, and this vote in the fcc here).

So why do you say "vote them out" as if it would help anything??

Obviously voting and writing nice letters doesn't do shit.

$C: The soap box failed, the ballot box failed, the jury box will fail.

All that is left is the ammo box.

Our government has proven it is tyrannical.

It is time to take our government back by force. 

Right after I finish this YouTube playlist... 
$C: we will have to show them by voting out the ones who have started implementing the downfall of the free or somewhat free internet.
 
$C: This pisses me off.  I'm definitely voting this coming mid election so that these assholes no longer are serving we the people.
$C: If one website is blocked I will send it to the rational FCC members and use it as a violation of the 1st amendment via censorship

$C: I seem to remember a certain event in history regarding taxation without representation that spurred some revolution or something. Feels pretty similar.
$C: https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/7xwknx/republican-members-of-congress-fcc-letter

Here is the list of rep that votes to repeal net neutrality. If this list is not correct, can someone point me to a complete list? This need to be shared whenever there is an election so we can really get our voices heard through our votes

$C: > Mark this and vote accordingly.

GOP lost a voter in a key swing state. Between Moore, NN, and the tax bill, I've officially gone from "center right" to "pro-2A Democrat". This last month has been the final straw for me.
$C: i doubt theyll get voted out, i dont get why people put their faith in the system, this whole ordeal shouldve been proof enough that the system is broken and can be manipulated, whats wrong with you people. take you freedom into your own hands. srsly stop relying on the system to do it for u 
$C: You can't. Because Gerrymandering. The only solution IMO is to elect another president who would appoint a non-puppet chair to the FCC who in turn will repeal the repeal (That's possible right?). This of course will give ISPs 3 years to establish a new status-quo.
Also, I don't think Americans care.
$C: Great job Republicans, you got what you wanted.
$C: >this has been a partisan issue

ISPs bought and paid for every GOP supporter. I won't pretend that that doesn't make the GOP look bad, but if you ask real people, it doesn't matter to them which party line they fall on. Everyone likes the idea of net neutrality. 

Edit: but yeah vote those fuckers out. 
$C: I want to thank the Russians for their tireless hard work taking over our government. This is what treason looks like. Now it's up to us to either make lots of noise or become complacent puppets.
$C: America is so fucked lmao
$C: And let’s not forget that any legislation re: NN that comes out in Congress from Republicans will almost certainly be Pro-ISP if not written directly by them. Details matter. Don’t be fooled. 
$C: Would it be possible for them to make this vote share the same fate as trump’s immigration ban in the wake of these issues with the process?
$C: That bomb threat had pie worried you could tell. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Democracy hasn't truly existed for a long time in America. When The population's opinion as a whole doesn't count and it comes down to a handful of powerful people to decide the fate, of any bill really, sounds less and less like a democracy to me and more and more of a group of dictators.  
$C: Can't the New York AG do something about this?
$C: #COME ON GUYS, KOKESH 2020!! WE CAN DO IT
$C: Where's your evidence of 80%?
$C: And if they don’t go? What then will you do? 
$C: I'm in Illinois, who can I vote out?
$C: Or TAKE TO THE STREETS. How are you not protesting right now?! 
$C: I'd rather have no representative than one that helped repeal net neutrality 
$C: Violent removal of corruption is my vote.  Screw voting them out.  Take them out.
$C: Is there any way to tell whose identities were taken to write anti net neutrality comments?
$C: When will we have a political uprising? Aren’t we tired of being fucked by the federal government? 
$C: Okay, but...how? Do we have to wait for the election cycles? I'm asking as someone who just voted for the first time last year; what can I do right now to get these people out?
$C: When are we going to realize D.C. doesn't care what the people want? The only time they care about the people is when they need their votes.  Then they say anything just to get elected or re-elected and then go back to not caring.  And this goes for BOTH sides of the aisle, they all do it.  Something has to change.
$C: Not so sure about that.  /r/the_donald has been very happy that Net Neutrality was ended: https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7jtesf/the_battle_for_net_neutrality_is_over_the/
$C: Well I mean you do always have the violent option. A gunshot to the head could do the trick in setting a precedent.
$C: And vote in a new bunch of puppets? The puppet-masters will always win. 
$C: Sometimes peaceful means are not the answer.
$C: Can’t really vote the FCC chairs out though... they are appointed by the president. 
$C: They should implement id verification with the petition and voting process then. 
$C: Yes this. Fuck these people, they are traitors... Need to root them out.
$C: capitalism trumps democracy. Voting them out won't matter. They'll find new ways to fuck everyone over. Either get rid of the entire system or just suck it up.
$C: Do you have a source on the 80%+ statistic?
$C: Fuck yeah, what he said!
$C: All consumers are equal, but some are more equal than others.
$C: The biggest corporations in the world, Google and Amazon, were in favour of NN. Obviously the corporate shill is you.
$C: Some of us will be getting rid of our internet and using wifi wherever possible. 
$C: Oxygen is flammable and is an important ingredient in bombs used by terrorists. Repealing oxygen would would stop 99% of IEDs and create a safer America for our children.

Stop oxygen, save America!
$C: Five years ago, in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre, 90% of Americans agreed on increasing background checks for firearm purchases.

The Republican controlled legislature didn't do anything about that, either, and for the same reason. The GOP puts their donors above all else.
$C: Sure thing, u/Gayfetus
$C: Ya! I did this recently. Went to DC for a few days and was surprised at how easy it is. Find and organization that has experience and they can show you around. 
$C: Aren't congressional representatives being supported by substantial campaign contributions from the telecoms? How would any individual American compete with 5 and 6-digit contributions?
$C: Nice motivation Gayfetus!
$C: I deeply wish I could visit my house rep's and sentators' offices, but Cruz and Culberson have refused to show their faced around here (Houston) any more than they absolutely have to. They're hard to track down. 
$C: My rep had to leave office due to bugging his staff about wanting to put a baby in them for $5million. Scumbag.
$C: [The Revolution Will Not Be Televised...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGaoXAwl9kw)
$C: Yeah, good luck finding an opening in their schedule.
$C: When Britain did this to our ancestors, we killed them until they left the continent.
$C: Solution: Never vote Republican
$C: The US isn't a direct democracy,  thank god. 

The people voted for its removal by voting in people that supported it. 
$C: This is literally what the second amendment is for. 
$C: There wasn't a vote for this. You're talking about polls - very different. 
$C: I don't recall voting on this issue....
$C: We don't live in a democracy. Not saying I agree with this FCC decision
$C: And 50% of Americans voted for the party that put NN repeal in their official platform.

This is democracy.  We just have stupid voters.
$C: I would agree with you, although we technically don't live in a democracy, we live in a congressional republic. I feel as though people misinterpret our what kind of government we have fairly regularly and I try to point that out to both sides when either site the fact that we live in a democracy. Our founding fathers actually hated democracy. Thomas Jefferson said something along the lines of it being one of the worst forms of government due to the fact that there's a certain mob mentality to them and the majority overwhelmingly stomps every minority in every issue. Sorry if it's off topic, just throwing it out there.
$C: There are over 300 miliion Americans. Less than 10% commented on net neutrality. Welcome to a broken society.
$C: Aw did they ignore the same liberals who have been whining and throwing a temper tantrum for years because they know nothing about the topic? Sad..
$C: He was so smug and cunty until that note was handed to him. Then he became a shakey terrified cunt.
$C: Yeah but let's be real. They're fucking with the internet. Did they really expect to not get swatted? 
$C: Someone needs to pull a black mirror on him and make him fuck a pig
$C: Net Neutrality itself is a non-partisan issue but he's still a republican; Of course he's going to work terrorism and probably 9/11 into this somehow, if he hasn't already done so.
$C: It’s funny af how they posted this right before that happened. 
$C: Reading some of the comments on here, people are legitimately wanting to be violent. Pretty unfortunate. 
$C: They should totally do the layover with him. Like they did with Saddam and Mel Gibson. 
$C: Sucks the season is over. I'd love to see South Park shit on him
$C: I don't think they can fit his teeth in a single shot.
$C: Or toilet paper, but that would be racist because he is brown skimned.
$C: Oh my god you're right!  He could be the new Saddam Hussein!
$C: It’s just so punchable.
$C: Yup. Wikipedia article for the day: [Regulatory capture.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regulatory_capture&oldid=814448709)
$C: > In the back of my mind, I wish that we could throttle and fuck over all websites or things associated with supporters of this repeal.

Well hey - now you can! (if you own your own ISP) 
$C: I'm not super educated on how all this works, but could we all band together and for example, hug of death the Verizon payment page if they block sites or do other anti-consumer shit?
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves. Violence was part of equal rights for Race and Gender. Violence stopped the Nazis and saved millions of lives. Violence created our Country and maintained it. It is a tool and in some situations it is the best tool for the job. This is one of those situations because all other avenues have been exhausted and the powers of the government themselves are being abused So there it is. There is the solution.     

I know you all won't listen and I know we will lose the internet because of it. I hope your ego and pretentious morality was worth us losing one the greatest wonders of the human world. My resentment is no longer just for the corrupt human garbage that pushed against Net Neutrality, but also now for all of you who allowed it to happen just because you didn't want to get dirty to clean up the filth.    

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: True,  but are we really expecting Pai to change his mind? What, did the Three Ghosts of the Free Internet come to see him last night and make him see the error of his ways?
$C: Oh my God I just turned it on as they voted.  They're patting themselves on the back.  They're smug.  They're disgusting.

I had to turn it on then.

edit: One thing I will say, Jessica Rosenworcel, I appreciated her speech.  I also appreciate Mignon Clyburn as well.

edit 2: Oh shit they had to clear out due to something going on outside.  They just said security advised them to get out.

edit 3: Sniffing with dogs, wow.  Must be a bomb threat or something.

edit 4: Fuck Ajit Pai.

last edit: The *venom*... Clyburn's "I discend," sounded just tired, but did anyone hear the venom in Rosenworcel's vote?
$C: Two have said they're going to vote to approve, and Pai will obviously do the same.  It's done.
$C: 2 out of 3 approvals, approved. Pai is last. 
$C: WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?? Security risk?

EDIT: Security risk passed, they voted to repeal, if you see this please donate to the EFF!
$C: Yea wtf? Why is this posted already. No one has voted yet.
$C: Pai angers me, 'ther has been no evidence of companies blocking sites' um...Comcast slowed and blocked BitTorrent in 2008...or Madison river communication which blocked VoIP....or the fact that bigger companies literally killed competitive local exchange carriers in 2004..yet we are suppose to trust these guys...
$C: It's extremely clear to anyone watching the live stream that they're going to vote the way they've said they're going to vote.  This battle is over, you're just pointing out that some of the wounded laying on the beach haven't technically died yet.

It's time to focus on the next battle so that we can win the war.
$C: I tried to watch and I can't. That fucking asshole is sitting there and lying through his teeth. It's fucking infuriating.
$C: When the meeting/livestream is over someone should count the total number of false statements he makes. As in proven many times to be false. 
$C: Jessica Rosenworcel is a good speaker.


$C: They just told them to leave everything... but the Live Feed I am watching clearly shows Pai pocket his cellphone, while everybody else couldn't.

Without advocating for it, somehow not surprised in the slightest.

The Boston Tea Party happened because of a huge dissonance between decisions and public opinion, culminating in an act that was in part about being heard.

There's been plenty of frustrating issues for both parties, but net neutrality has fundamentally been one where the communication on it has been fucked over from the start.  Shutting down all reasonable communication doesn't make it go away, it's like corking a bottle.

Still, hope nobody did something really stupid and everyone's okay.  Scary indeed.

Edit: added quote that this was in response to, for proper context.
$C: I mean, it's a foregone conclusion if we're being honest. They're going to vote on party lines and the repeal will pass. We might as well chalk this up as an L, though we did everything we could. I think it's more productive to focus on what's next at this point
$C: Thnx for updates :) i am in school so i cant watch the stream. Keep us posted.
$C: I mean, if they weren't going to do it, they'd cancel the vote. 

In THEORY they can still vote it down. 
$C: What's with the long speeches? Either yay or nay.

Is Net neutrality going to meet Mr. Mayhem?
$C: They didn't even *start* the vote yet!
$C: They have a security threat? Any idea what’s happening?
$C: wonder if someone tried to interrupt Pais speech with a bomb scare
$C: So we still have time to watch our porn?!
$C: Pai kind of looks and sounds like [Butt-head.](https://i.imgur.com/YAotmkc.png)

$C: They just were told to evacuate too
$C: /u/spez has the inside scoop from his corporate daddies
$C: My guess is that spez scheduled this to be posted when the vote was to conclude and then went off to spend his day snorting coke off hookers' asses or whatever it is that goes on at reddit HQ.  They weren't anticipating a delayed vote.

Either way though it's not like the vote is going to be a surprise.  This post will be relevant exactly as written, just not quite yet.
$C: Woah they canceled the proceeding due to a security concern. Police just entered the room and cleared everyone out.
$C: IIRC, the numbers are not in our favor.  And since the vote is imminent, there's nothing more we can do to fight it.
$C: Game over.
$C: bomb threat?
$C: What just happened?
$C: Shit-head never actually voted before the security stoppage, did he? This isn't officially over yet then?
$C: Might be one of those pre written things most press makes in case something does happen, and spez accidently posted it
$C: Look at this motherfucker, lying his ass off...
$C: Im watching voting now.  Only seen two so far and both are FOR internet Freedom!!

$C: This fourth person is a nay. so 2 nay 2 yay

$C: Isn't it "yea" not "yay"?
$C: This is going to go down as the timeline for the temporary death of Net Neutrality. 
$C: They are searching the area with dogs now. 
$C: "Security threat".  
$C: whats with the bomb dog?!
$C: I know net neutrality is good, but making bomb threats is a dick move
$C: Thanks for so many updates. I'm at work and this is all I'm able to check atm.
$C: Oh fuck, "apocalyptic rhetoric", fuck man, he's a fuckin' shitbag.
$C: Thanks for keeping me updated!!!
$C: Can you mark your post as NSFW? I don't appreciate seeing the American people getting so violently fucked.
$C: is it too late to download my wank bank?
$C: > Edit: Pai comparing internet traffic to sewer lines? Ok man 12:48 PM

I just started watching but I'm pretty sure he said that internet traffic  is _not_ like sewer lines because the use of them are relatively static vs. the growing internet. He was addressing the common comparison that many people make when explaining net neutrality.
$C: Why did everybody leave? And what are the cops and dogs searching for.. I just hope they found some drugs on Pai... Or worse.
$C: Nope, Ajit was in the middle of his presentation and they had to evacuate the bldg! 

$C: I think this was a scheduled post. Premature, but still not going to be wrong.
$C: And now Pai will play the victim even though he's absolutely asking for physical violence after consistently ignoring literally millions of pleas to not go through with his selfish plan.
$C: good! thanks for this 
$C: keep the updates its good!
$C: Wild... 
$C: Is that it now or will they carry on?
$C: God Pai is such a smug son of a bitch. 
$C: Thats alot of LEO....
$C: To be fair, he was contrasting internet traffic and sewer lines saying they are not at all the same. He explains putting regulations intended for one on the other isn't the way to do it. I'm all for net neutrality but let's at least get it right when we bash people. 
$C: Did you just witness that bomb threat? Wow. 
$C: He compared internet traffic to sewer lines and then had the balls to act like bitcoin mining would put strain on ISPs. Like, that is a 100% straight up fucking lie. I can't believe he actually said that.
$C: Hopefully someone tags Pai. And no one will give a fuck
$C: looks like the bomb is gone back to the vote now
$C: Streaming online...surprised they didn't get swatted. 
$C: Fuck this guy.
$C: :03 Either Pie is an amazing liar, or he really believes he is doing the right thing. How on earth does that happen?

So anyway, there was a bomb threat?

Oh here he goes again... 
$C: these updates are better than twitter
$C: so much bs. "Everyone will still be able to access all the content they want"....Yea for more money. What a piece of shit Pai is. This is health care all over again. Yea, all Americans have access to health care, but at a crazy cost. As a Canadian, I feel sorry for those south of our border. GL america
$C: Is it true that they are just voting to restore a system that was in place up till 2015?

EDIT: Nevermind. The reason they had to change the laws in 2015 was because companies were taking advantage, and not allowing for Net Neutrality. 
$C: It passed, So now what?
$C: I thought this would have been more obvious before now what with the current admin repealing all Obama-era regulations just because it was Obama who passed them. We have moved from behind-the-scenes players to our government openly fucking over the public without any sense of duty or caring what anyone thinks. 
$C: You're not wrong. I also feel powerless today. Even if we can vote these people out of office, what's to stop the next group from falling into the same situation? 
$C: Need some good old American Revolution type action.
$C: > Ya know, maybe i'm just being emotional since i'm VERY frustrated by all of this, but letters, calls, and voting simply aren't working.

its because the FCC doesnt have constituents. they are not elected officals by the public. there is no recourse though politics that we can have an effect on.
$C: I agree, make them afraid, for their jobs. The FCC are appointed officials, not elected, but there are a large number of senators and house reps who either supported Pai or did nothing to stop him. Know the names of your local reps, and get registered to vote if you aren't already. 

Midterms are coming November 2018.
$C: You have to wonder, how much more money can some people need? All we have on them anymore is numbers. 
$C: Nobody is saying we should become violent but look, the French revolution brought us. We have to start holding politicians accountable and the system is rigged to where even if we vote were supressed by new voting laws and gerrymandering. 
$C: [removed]
$C: I've said this for a while now. You can't play by government rules and expect to win. Government doesn't give a shit about you. I got into arguments telling people good luck calling congressmen, unless you attached bribes of millions, they had no interest in listening.

I think we do need to resort to extreme measures, ise our sheer numbers against them.
$C: It be nice to have a death note right about now lol
$C: Did you seriously think that big corporations give any sort of fuck about the people that stand in the way of their bottom line? All this write you senator and phone calls do absolutely nothing. 

Yeah this sucks but there wasn’t a single thing that could’ve been done. They know despite whatever the fuck they do YOU’LL STILL PAY. Big oil could jack the gas prices up to $15 dollars a gallon and everyone would bitch and complain but they know you’d still buy it. 

My opinion here so go ahead and ridicule me and downvote me but seriously stop thinking your voice has any say in the matter when big corporations are in the way because they don’t care.
$C: Exactly it's so damned useless and pathetic. It looked stupid to begin with and now we have the ultimate proof that this calling and emailing bullshit achieves nothing. Yeti guarantee that will be the next fucking stupid and useless tactic. It's amazingly futile. 

They don't care and calling or texting them isn't going to change that either. Why in the world some people, who seem intelligent usually, thought it was even worth a try is beyond me. 
$C: [removed]
$C: [removed]
$C: The FCC doesn't give a shit about us. But congress can't ignore us forever. We have to keep fighting.
$C: We've left the era of public opinion. The conglomerates have us tamed, they can bend our will and get away with blatant corruption without fear of reprisal. What's going to happen? They could fucking *stuff the ballot boxes*, like literally any corporation could walk in to a polling station on election day with armed guards and take control, with full support of the government, and *fucking nothing would happen*.

Everyone says "we would take up arms against tyranny and defend democracy!" No you fucking *wouldn't*, you're too absorbed in fucking Facebook and Twitter and, yes, Reddit. Maybe a few hundred people would fight back. Maybe even a few thousand. Who gives a *shit?* The military is so brainwashed they would paint the protests as armed insurrections and put them down.

Democracy died a long time ago.
$C: You know who gives a fuck? The people taking your money. 

HBO, Netflix, iTunes Music, Spotify, Google Fiber, Comcast, ATT, Verizon, etc. will realize that these rules need to be reversed once people quit paying money because they are being gouged for these services. 

The only way to make a political impact anymore is with money. There’s too much corruption in government.  Voting for someone that will do the right thing doesn’t help, because there’s too much money behind the corrupt politicians that are only looking to line their own pockets. 
$C: >  Making them uncomfortable and fearful is, at this point, the only thing that will reverse the course this country is on.

I want to agree, but the problem is the FBI and the other investigative/legal departments can come in and make your life miserable or arrest you.

**The primary tool for accountability is your vote. The next, most effective thing you can do is run for office yourself.** You have to get past your fear of the third rail. It is easy to shout in an echo chamber and feel good. Actually talking to your neighbors about this or people in your voting district/community (ie: grabbing the third rail) is hard.

- Don't verbally attack people (you are there to change minds. Attacks make people dig in)

- Have a short set of talking points memorized (3-5 points that are quick and easy to remember. *Then* have some extra info on hand to elaborate if asked and it helps to know the rebuttals so you can counter things and make your case stronger)

- Don't make a scene. (Making a fool of yourself in public and expecting sympathy? You're just going to make your cause look bad)

- Talk to local news, write opinions for local papers. (people still read these)

- DO NOT LIE (do not exaggerate or obfuscate or fabricate any information. Use facts. We are trying to fix this "alternative facts" shit, don't feed the fire)


$C: [removed]
$C: There's an awful lot of otherwise very peaceful and happy people who are reeeeally close to advocating violence about a lot of issues with the US government lately.  Pretty scary.

Even scarier, I do not necessarily disagree. 
$C: >  but letters, calls, and voting simply aren't working. 

They aren't working because people don't send letters, calls or vote until it's too late.  You can't care about politics once every 4 years.  

America had a choice in November and they chose a candidate that was very clear that he didn't agree with net neutrality.  Sending a few letters and signing a few online positions 9 months later is not going to change the course we are on...the boulder is already halfway down the hill at this point.

Now we regroup....we focus on getting out the politicians who supported this, and get different politicians in.  But we have to work now, and continue working all the way up to Nov 2018.  Not be mad on a reddit thread for 5 minutes and then go back to not being actively involved.

Any law that is passed can be revoked.  This is reversible.  If we continue to apply pressure.
$C: The FCC aren't even elected by the public
$C: the mask is finally starting to slip off of america (for white people at least --- minorities have known that it was a lie all along). this country is founded upon greed and a "fuck you, i've got mine" mentality alone. there *IS* nothing else. 
$C: [removed]
$C: It's because effective nihilism doesn't do anything.  Now, I'm not disagreeing with you that things eventually (if history has taught us anything) break down to the point of violence being introduced, at which point things definitely change.  However, people lately seem to forget that it's messy, doesn't always leave many survivors, and those that are left aren't always left with "Well finally we got the solution we wanted."  You may very well end up on the losing side and it could be worse.

So, before we get to the point of "Nothing matters anymore, screw it.", get out and vote, call your congress people, talk to your friends/family, be an activist to the degree that you can.  Because there's a window where doing that works better than jumping straight to a scenario where we desolate the land and *hope* our side is the side that wins... if there's anything left to win at that point.
$C: Voting works. 

The moment folks like yourself stop believing that, is the moment they win. Stay strong and encourage your like-minded friends and family to get out and vote. Not just for the president, either. In fact, voting at the local level has far more effect on you than you may realize. 

It isn't easy, and it takes commitment to force change. Despite what others have disturbingly suggested, violence is not an option. Do your civic duty and get involved. Know who's running, and what they're running for. Don't be afraid to educate people who may not know. We are the answer, but we can't keep letting losses like this set us back to the mentality that our votes don't matter.

We will continue to suffer losses in the near-term, and that is because of the people in office. Stay strong and vote, rally, protest, and keep your wits in these crazy times. We'll see a brighter outlook in 4 years if we can. 
$C: This is a general problem in politics. We need a revolution more than ever.
$C: >This isn't a call to violence, but the only way things will change, is if these people in government are afraid. Making them uncomfortable and fearful is, at this point, the only thing that will reverse the course this country is on. These fucks need to be reminded that their job is to represent us. It's not an opportunity to add more zeros to their bank account, it's an opportunity to help the community that elected them. This needs to be dramatically pointed out to them

It's almost as if the gun control measures were never about preventing crime. 
$C: > Ya know, maybe i'm just being emotional since i'm VERY frustrated by all of this, but letters, calls, and voting simply aren't working. These people don't give a single fuck about any of us. 

Correct. Vote with your wallet, and get out and VOTE. Remember these people are only interested in money not your opinion. You have to hit them in the pocketbook.

In fact, if people simply cancelled internet until this was repealed, you'd see it repealed PDQ.

$C: > but letters, calls, and voting simply aren't working.

Uh, it's working completely as intended. We just voted to dismantle Silicon Valley's power over Americans and it seems we're getting there step by step.
$C: You're goddamn right.


$C: No such thing as a bloodless coup.
$C: Time for a revolution friend.
$C: Nothing is going to happen until the people make it happen. Upvoting on Reddit doesn't cut it.
$C: I truly believe that I will be witness to the second American Civil War before I die. Its is the track that this gov't and country is set on and it seems completely unavoidable. Eventually people will have enough, they will get angry enough and become violent, and everyday I see that becoming closer to reality. 

As John F. Kennedy said, "Those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable." 
$C: It works on your reps, this won't be a permanent decision.  It's been a long fight to get to the two past years, the fight continues.
$C: Well with no internet maybe people will take more drastic measures.
$C: “You are the all singing, all dancing crap of the world”.
$C: This! Letters and calls simply won't work.
$C: No. We should turn to violence. 
$C: Voting doesn't work? The majority of America doesn't vote. Not in midterms, not in primaries.

Don't give up when we, as a country, aren't even trying.
$C: We the people don't have power in America. 
$C: Glad at least someone agrees with me! I posted similar comments over in r/technology and got banned for it, but thats honestly okay. I know there are people who also agree that something has to give, which is why we need to actively do something about this. If I could go and organize a rally to march on the White House (because Trump's the one who appointed Ajit Die) or the FCC's headquarters, I would. I'd throw some gold your way if I had the ability to!
$C: [The Revolution Will Not Be Televised...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGaoXAwl9kw)
$C: And the congress isn't doing shit (perhaps maybe a few but that's not enough to make a difference).
$C: voting mattered in november.
$C: This is so very sad, but true. They are more worried about controlling us and using our money to fund illegal operations around the world to further their own goals. I hate to say it but I don't see the people having any kind of power going forward. We are simply a herd of sheep to them whose opinions and thoughts do not matter because we do not align with their destructive, psychopathic, self-serving actions. It is all about the big companies and bankers staying on top and raping the common person for as much of our money as they can get to further plunge the world in to a more easily controlled state.

To them, we are nothing but a nuisance that exists in their world, they are not for us, only WE can be for us. But maybe if we stand together we can rip some of these bastards from their golden thrones of power and corruption and get some of our freedoms back for our future generations. It may result in a loss of life as we've seen from other radical government movements in other countries through history, but surely if we do not we will have loss of freedom and life regardless. (This is not about contacting the appropriate channels who claim to care, sorry.)
$C: > Ya know, maybe i'm just being emotional since i'm VERY frustrated by all of this, but letters, calls, and voting simply aren't working.

Voting would have worked, actually. 

If people had actually voted for Hillary in November, instead of screeching "BUT HER EMAILS!!" at the top of their lungs. 

OH WELL. 
$C: I feel the same way man this hole thing is all bull shit they don't give a single fuck about us..i hope that the lsps block everyone of ajit pai' s well everything
$C: Wow, the Internet gets deregulated and you want to riot.step away from Reddit 
$C: You ever stop to think that maybe you are in the minority on this issue?

I know it's hard to fathom from inside the reddit echo chamber.
$C: > Making them uncomfortable and fearful is

Terrorism. That is a concise definition of terrorism if I ever saw one.
$C: Well, I'd be happy to talk to you about my opposition to net neutrality, as someone who has no stake in internet regulations beyond being an avid internet user myself.
$C: I do not profit from repealing net neutrality and I am in support of it. Go ahead and downvote me all you want, Reddit has worked themselves into hysterics over nothing. Before bet neutrality, we didn't have any issues. Net neutrality didn't solve anything. Internet providers won't charge extra for access to certain websites or block access to websites because that is a TERRIBLE BUSINESS MOVE. They would immediately get shredded by opposition. The only way it would work for them to charge packages to access websites is if they colluded, and if you knew anything about economics, you'd know that is highly unlikely. They will always have more to gain by not colluding or breaking their agreement. Look up game theory/Nash equilibrium/dominant strategy. Capitalism always works out, and the United States is not a democracy, it's a republic. It was designed that way because majority rule has always resulted in oppression. The founding fathers also knew that the majority of Americans would be idiots, like we're seeing today.

$C: The bandwidth is bought and owned already and has been for a very long time. There is nothing they can do besides maybe pay off politicians to act against the repeal. 
$C: Google founder Eric Schmidt is against net neutrality.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality#Arguments_against
$C: But didn't Ajit Pai said that he doesn't read letters from everyday people, only lawyers and corporations? 
$C: The FCC has said that writing them does not work. I don't know why you'd still be pushing this.
$C: Good bot
$C: "net neutrality is not a partisan issue"
$C: That'll do bot, that'll do.
$C: Protesting only matters when the person you are trying to convince to change their mind has a conscience. The current government has demonstrated that they do not, given the protests that were bluntly ignored.
$C: Good bot
$C: Honestly, why? Why would emailing Ajit Pai	change anything? He, and every other Republican, is going to do whatever his corporate master tell him. I live in a blue state, so there's nothing that emailing these people will do. Also, even in a red state, they're just going to reply with "But competition", and continue to win their elections cos "the other guy is a dumbocrat who will legalize gay abortions and ban machine gun jesus"

$C: Clyburn and Rosenworcel both championed to keep Net Neurtrality in place. what is that I keep hearing about both parties are the same...
$C: good bot.
$C: THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE:

In any given situation, there are certain strategies that will be effective, and certain strategies that will be ineffective. The ISPs want this. The FCC wants this. The federal government wants this. 

However, we will only lose if the collective we allows us to lose. If we all really want net neutrality, we need to show them that we aren't messing around. The only way to show them that is to threaten to cut your ISP subscription on a certain date if they do not abandon this agenda, and if they do not abandon the agenda, you and about 10 million people need to cancel their subscriptions immediately. Think about it. That's $600 million every month we maintain a boycott. But we need numbers in the millions. We need those numbers to place their names on a list as a petition and a pledge, a *true and honest pledge* (not like that worthless DARE pledge you took in gradeschool).

[So, to save Net Neutrality, you'll have to DO IT YOURSELF! Sign the petition to pledge to boycott Your ISP, AND request the resignation of Ajit Pai!](http://chn.ge/2zgjW8o)

I hate to say it, but if this doesn't work, you might as well consider your Net Neutrality gone. The petition to the White House is nice, but it lacks a pledge and a call to action. Beyond that, Trump appointed Pai. This is Pai's entire purpose.

$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves. Violence was part of equal rights for Race and Gender. Violence stopped the Nazis and saved millions of lives. Violence created our Country and maintained it. It is a tool and in some situations it is the best tool for the job. This is one of those situations because all other avenues have been exhausted and the powers of the government themselves are being abused So there it is. There is the solution.     

I know you all won't listen and I know we will lose the internet because of it. I hope your ego and pretentious morality was worth us losing one the greatest wonders of the human world. My resentment is no longer just for the corrupt human garbage that pushed against Net Neutrality, but also now for all of you who allowed it to happen just because you didn't want to get dirty to clean up the filth.    

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: Nice bot.
$C: Why bother writing to people who clearly are bought and paid for? They are going to ignore everyone who isn't their employer and they're willing to screw over the entire nation for financial gain.

But i think we could change the mind of michael o'rielly or brendan carr

Why does he have an R beside his name when he's Obama's friend, and Obama appointed him to the FCC?
$C: It won't make any difference.  The only real hope is to get these bastards voted out of office by voting some other bastards into office, except make sure the new ones are for net neutrality.
$C: In NC the Senators are just like "I see you don't like this, and I am voting for it anyway." IOW: "I am not here to do your bidding, I am here to do the bidding of the ISPs and related businesses that have lined my pockets." 
$C: That's why I advocate for guillotines.
$C: Your not being pessimistic your being realistic.. because look at the uproar this country made over net neutrality and look at the end result.. in fact look at how much opposition the American people have faced in the last few years from out representatives. I think it's pretty clear at this point they don't give a fuck about governing.. obtaining a position of power is just a way to get rich now a days 
$C: If this could be a wedge issue for the next election cycle (which might be difficult in the wake of Citizens United) people could vote out representatives who don't represent them.
$C: You're not pessimistic, you're absolutely right. Changing out the puppets isn't going to fix anything when the whole theater is in shambles down to the foundation.

Our government is essentially holding the public hostage to its whims. And that government itself is hostage to capital interests (powerful wealth hoarders) and its whims.

Writing a strongly worded letter isn't going to do a damn thing. Wealthy Land Lords have basically gotten to write the rules since the beginning of this country.

Nearly every founding father was a (inherited) wealthy, land lording, slave owning, ruthless capitalist. Our system is just Feudalism, with a choose-your-lord contract. We are not free.
$C: Midterm elections are next year. Vote the bastards out, every last one of them.
$C: Stop voting for republicans.
$C: It likely won't. Many are deep set against it, or are already for it. If your rep is against net neutrality, vote them out. Encourage others to get rid of them. Only way to even potentially ensure it comes back is to get a super majority blue 2018 Congress. 

If your rep has a townhall, go to it, question them about this. 

$C: Just not the 10-20% who are paying their campaign contributions, and sending them on "fact finding missions" to Europe.
$C: It's one of those days where you have to take comfort in the eventual heat death of the universe.
$C: I don't think it's negative, you're just being real. If writing our representatives actually did anything we wouldn't be dealing with this right now. They support whoever pays the most.
$C: I literally got an auto response email from my state’s senator at the exact time the FCC was voting. Very automated and unhelpful response. They don’t care what we think. It’s so frustrating and belittling. 
$C: in 80 years there will be kids in denmark, norway, sweden, canada, etc who will tout the "thank god my grandpa moved away from the united states so i could have a better life" narrative, just like how so many american immigrants used to tell it about moving to america from somewhere else. 

the usa is a sinking fucking ship, imo. people who are getting out now will be looked at as the smart ones.
$C: You need to put money in the letter you write.

They only respond to money.
$C: In academia you hear all the time "write to your representatives it's important to let them hear your voice!" I always do, and I always ALWAYS get the same cookie cutter response that seems like some intern copied and pasted it. It's very frustrating and makes me concerned, especially when I take a lot of effort making a good case. If the message is long or short, full of data or devoid of defense, it's always the same generic "I hear you but..." reply. 
$C: It won't only coersion will convince them.
$C: I literally wrote, emailed and faxed mine... Accomplished? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. 
$C: it's not. need to sue to make the internet a basic utility. if that doesn't work, rise up motherfuckers!
$C: https://act.represent.us/sign/the-problem

Not a new issue. The actions of the government represent the interests of their shareholders - corporations and rich donors - with no regard to the actual desires of the public.
$C: > Maybe I'm pessimistic. But how is writing to my government representatives gonna change things?

not pessimistic at all.  you're a realist.

writing people doesn't change shit.  never has.  


$C: It's not; voting for Democrats and supporting Democratic candidates is the only thing that will change this (even if that candidate is imperfect) 
$C: I agree. I sent a letter to Steve Daines who just makes up really terrible excuses. They dont give two shits about the people. Only money. And as long as people are single issue voters, this will always be the status quo. 
$C: I honestly found it rather hilarious (in the sad kind of way where you either cry or laugh hysterically) how people acted like spamming a bunch of answering machines is going to do shit. The ones that would listen are already agaisnt, the other cunts will only listen to money so aside from not voting republicans or bribing them yourself, there's really no point. You can't change a politician's mind, you need to change the polititian.
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves. Violence was part of equal rights for Race and Gender. Violence stopped the Nazis and saved millions of lives. Violence created our Country and maintained it. It is a tool and in some situations it is the best tool for the job. This is one of those situations because all other avenues have been exhausted and the powers of the government themselves are being abused So there it is. There is the solution.     

I know you all won't listen and I know we will lose the internet because of it. I hope your ego and pretentious morality was worth us losing one the greatest wonders of the human world. My resentment is no longer just for the corrupt human garbage that pushed against Net Neutrality, but also now for all of you who allowed it to happen just because you didn't want to get dirty to clean up the filth.    

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: If enough people tell them they will do everything in their power to see them voted out of office next November, they'll start to listen. 
$C: We have to riot just like BLM, and show them it does matter...
$C: > how is writing to my government representatives gonna change things?

It won't. We have to vote them out. https://www.vote.org/
$C: I've read that there's something called the Congressional Review Act that allows Congress to overturn an action by a federal agency. So if enough people raise hell about this we still have a chance to flip it. But it has to be done within 60 days of the agency's vote. So don't give up yet. An agency voted against your interests today, not your representative. There's still time to have your representative actually represent you. 
$C: It puts you on record.

When justice comes around, they will answer for ignoring *you*.

We just need to remain vigilant and make sure justice rolls around.
$C: It's ok to be negative about shitty situations. 
$C: Because silly children like denial. This is about power and war. In war the first thing you do is cut off your enemies communications. The enemy here is anyone against Russia. The republicans are covering for Trump and the russians(which sent thousands of fake support posing as Americans for the repeal). Wake up sheeple....your country is overrun with traitors.
$C: dont be, pessimists are 90% always right, optimists always put their faith in the system and blah blah blah. 

optimists will be the death of us, naive hopes. in this world?! unreal... 
$C: You are merely stating facts. Despite how upset I am right now I am encouraged by the redditors who want to up the ante regarding opposition to these corrupt bastards.
$C: What is gonna change if you do not write?

At least one option has the potential of change..even if you believe it likely will not.
$C: In my experience it’s always good to leave a paper trail because that paper trail can be used as leverage for other cases 
$C: It probably won't change any minds or help but it's a hell of a lot safer and more legal than the other way of changing corrupt politicians' minds.  Better to try writing than end up dead or in jail.
$C: It won't. Americans have something else to protect them when the government fails to represent the will of the people, it's called the Second Amendment.
$C: > I'm pretty sure they know 80-90 percent of the US wants net neutrality.

How do you think they know that? By people writing/calling/emailing/faxing/sky-writing their opinions in. 
$C: If you do it, you can say you have complained later.

If you don't do it, you can only say you had the chance but chose to stay quiet.
$C: "89-90 percent" of redditors.
$C: Because they believe title II is a terrible framework to regulate the internet even if title I might be too loose. Most representatives support a congressional solution that falls somewhere in between the two.

"While I support consumers’ ability to access the Internet, I had serious concerns that the FCC's 2015 attempt to prevent Internet companies from blocking or slowing consumers relied on a 1930s portion of law, which was never intended to regulate the Internet. Using outdated regulation to police Internet companies threatens innovation and investment in the Internet. The FCC’s latest decision provides a new opportunity to find a way forward on bipartisan legislation that permanently prevents companies from blocking or slowing consumers. I believe that consumers should be able to access websites without a company unfairly blocking them or slowing down their Internet speeds, which is why I support legislation to ensure this issue is resolved once and for all instead of leaving it up to the whim of the FCC." ~Cory Gardner

This has never been a fight about net neutrality, but around the regulatory framework by which ISPs and the internet are regulated.

The congressional solution is less subject to whims of the executive branch to provide a more lasting framework that companies can plan for the future in and is the way our government was designed to handle things like this.
$C: Yes! True American heroes championing the voice of the American people.
$C: it's ALWAYS the fucking women. i've been a broken record on twitter for months about this. women *are* the god damn revolution. i swear if we could pull a twilight zone and just magically replace all male leaders with women, we'd be in a much better position. 
$C: It's disgusting to see such blatant disregard for what is an overwhelming consensus by the public. This wasn't 50/50, this wasn't 60/40, this was more like 99/1 and it was extremely obvious. The public wanted one thing, they knew it, and they went ahead with this anyway. Democracy my ass. 
$C: We should rebel like the French 
$C: Just goes to show the US isn't a democracy.
$C: This is a proven topic. Multiple peer reviewed research papers have concluded that U.S. public policy is almost exclusively dominated by monied interests and big business.

[Here's one](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B#) I've found after a quick search (feel free to add more). 

In a study by Princeton and Northwestern, Gilens and Page reviewed nearly 2,000 national surveys conducted between 1981 and 2002 that touched on hundreds of public policy changes concerning “matters of relatively high salience, about which it is plausible that average citizens may have real opinions and may exert some political influence.” Authors report that policies lacking broad support among the rich are only implemented around 18 percent of the time. On the other hand, proposals supported by the elite are adopted more than twice as often, some 45 percent of the time.
$C: We did. Last November. Elections have consequences. 
$C: Not quite true. The FCC was technically never accountable to the public, since we don't vote them in. However, Congress and the Senate are, which is why we can pressure them to pass net neutrality as full-on law.
$C: You do in the voting booth. Never vote Republican.
$C: Should have voted Democrat.
$C: You need to vote. We all need to vote. People who care about this stuff don't vote enough in high enough numbers!
$C: The public absolutely has a say.  They voted for it.

Obama and Wheeler supported NN.  People voted in a GOP Congress and president and this is what we got.

Yes, huge proportions of the people oppose the NN repeal, but the anti-NN position is literally explicitly in the GOP platform.

We can blame gerrymandering for some of the current problems, but regardless of what people *say* they want, 50% of them voted for this.  Ryan has been reelected multiple times, McConnel has been reelected multiple times.  Rand Paul has been reelected multiple times.

We asked for this and they gave it to us, because a huge proportion of voters are absolute fucking morons.  And, frankly, I have no doubt people will vote R again at the next opportunity because whatever is wrong must be the Dems fault.
$C: Couldnt be more wrong. All public had to do was vote against trump. they didnt.
$C: And yet we will just continue to sit back.. and bitch about not having any say for a week or two.. then move on. This is how Orwellian states occur folks! Let's just sit back and keep being ass blasted 
$C: Pretty sure it was the 'public' that elected Trump and made this happen.
$C: Tell that to Alabama.
$C: That’s a part of capitalism. The ones with capital get to have a say in what goes on.
$C: Welcome to the harsh reality sweetie. You have no power.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Not all of 'em. Clyburn and the other woman, (whose name I'm not even going to attempt to spell) were vehemently opposed to repealing net neutrality.
$C: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splinternet
$C: What is so convoluted about getting cable channels on TV?
$C: I'm a college student. I live in off-campus housing and thus have to buy my own internet (which, in this day and age, is mandatory to pass any of my classes). The two fiber-optic companies in my area do not service my block and I'm left trying to choose between..... Oh wait, I never had a choice. Comcast Xfinity is ***THE ONLY*** service available in my immediate area. And they charge me $71 a month for shitty internet and abhorrent cable tv. I have like 7 watchable channels (out of a 50 channel package) and 5 of them are local. 



**HOW IS THIS EVEN REMOTELY ACCEPTABLE??????**
$C: Another real problem is nationalism. There's no need to be attached to a country. If you decide the US is no longer where you want to live, go somewhere else; I probably will in the future too. Just because you're born here doesn't mean you have to stay
$C: This may light a fire under the asses of developers to get new provider services up and running. Right now there isnt that much need for such a thing as many people arent very happy with fios and comcast, but they deal with it because they provide ok speeds for the most part. If Verizon and comcast decide to rape the people for extra profits while simultaneously throttling their speeds however, people will most likely be happy to go elsewhere for their internet which in turn will lessen the monopoly the current providers have on the country.
$C: The government paid for every home in America to have fiber connections. The ISPs hoarded that money and did not invest in infrastructure. 

On top of that, ISPs like Verizon have told their shareholders, who they are legally obligated to tell the truth to, that Net Neutrality did not impact investments in infrastructure.

Corporate greed and shitty anti consumer, anti choice deals have screwed your internet, not the idea that you shouldnt have to pay a premium for fast access to websites you already paid to use.
$C: Don't worry, you'll just have to now pay MORE for your shitty internet service if you go on fringe websites like Reddit :)
$C: Um. I find this post confusing. You are saying that your internet sucks and there has been no investment under the current rules, but you feel like changing the rules back to how they were before the innovation stopped is somehow going to stop the innovation that isn't happening because of the current rules?

I'm not sure on what side of the debate I am on yet, but this is genuinely confusing. 
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves.

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: I'm guessing that you DON'T have access to Verizon Fios, and you're talking about DSL. Fios is a fiberoptic line straight to your home. There's nothing shit about it, and you would certainly be able to get more than 300kb/s.
$C: Can concur source was tech for att
$C: You can't get FiOS and Uverse at the same address anywhere in the entire country. I think you're mistaken on this. 
$C: I'm in Kenya and I have a 3mb/s connection... I assumed it should be the opposite...
$C: Dont tell us write this down on paper and send it to congress.
$C: Lol
$C: How did net neutrality change that? 
$C: This may light a fire under the asses of developers to get new provider services up and running. Right now there isnt that much need for such a thing as many people arent very happy with fios and comcast, but they deal with it because they provide ok speeds for the most part.

$C: U can move if u want but this has global repercussions. People saying get rekt and that we deserved this for letting it get this far etc don't seem to realize how this will effect the shape if the world.
$C: Same with health care, same with tax cuts, same with this now. Pretty much everyone except for those crony corporate interests are against this abominable shit, yet that's exactly who the GOP serves. How do republicans still support these vermin? I doubt anyone in the world votes against their own self interests as much as republicans in america. 
$C: good bot
$C: [deleted]
$C: I am a developer for [savethenet.today](https://github.com/gu-app-club/save-the-net). We offered a similar service three weeks ago. When we found out that https://battleforthenet.com was able to subsidize the cost for sending letters we immediately disabled our service. We charged the absolute minimum of $1.50 for each letter. We used https://lob.com to send mail. I am not sure how I feel about a service like this becoming popular when there is an evidently free competing service... but I can't complain that people are taking initiative.
$C: Ok, I used to work as a political staffer and mailing your representatives is NOT MORE EFFECTIVE.

Mail to legislators is held up for at least a week by security checks, so most votes will already have happened. If you are sending a form letter, it's going to be treated like a form email. Call! Or better yet schedule a meeting. 
$C: Call. I know people hate calling, but it's the #1 tool we have right now. According to congressional staffers, calls take priority over letters, physical or digital. (Also, only call your reps, and leave your name and zip code. This is how tallies are verified.)
$C: I'm not trying to criticize this, just want to put it out there: This seems more like an ad for a service to mail letters than an actual comment in favor of net neutrality. $2 per page sent? We're only for net neutrality because we don't have money for the alternative. There should be an alternative way for those who can't afford the fee to help.
$C: We knew this was going to be a long war and while this is disappointing, you're absolutely right in encouraging people to reach out to their representatives (at all levels of government) to let them know how important it is to preserve net neutrality.
$C: Fuck the bot.  

Call your representatives, write letters, the internet is dead.
$C: I'm pissed. I have tried to do this so many times, but I can never get through to anyone, they are all not taking messages.

I'm not going to rant because you all probably feel as helpless as I do about this issue right now.. I'm not trying to be defeatist here, just realistic. Can we just start building a new internet already that they can't get their money grubby fuck hands all over?
$C: $2.00/page? Way to capitalize on this. 
$C: Already did, nothing happened.

Our government is a fucking farce. It's all just a distraction while the wealthy do whatever the fuck they want.


$C: "Sorry! You need to pay for the Civic Duty package to access those sites! Click here to add $3.99 to your bill."
$C: It might be soon, but with the screwed healthcare system, the new tax laws changing and screwing the middle class, and now this... 

I have to believe that younger people might actually begin to consider leaving the US for good... I know I am.

What kind of future is being pushed here with so many things trickling down to hurt the middle class. There’s countries with universal healthcare, schools, and real freedom. Why would I want to stay here? 
$C: THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE:

In any given situation, there are certain strategies that will be effective, and certain strategies that will be ineffective. The ISPs want this. The FCC wants this. The federal government wants this. 

However, we will only lose if the collective we allows us to lose. If we all really want net neutrality, we need to show them that we aren't messing around. The only way to show them that is to threaten to cut your ISP subscription on a certain date if they do not abandon this agenda, and if they do not abandon the agenda, you and about 10 million people need to cancel their subscriptions immediately. Think about it. That's $600 million every month we maintain a boycott. But we need numbers in the millions. We need those numbers to place their names on a list as a petition and a pledge, a *true and honest pledge* (not like that worthless DARE pledge you took in gradeschool).

[So, to save Net Neutrality, you'll have to DO IT YOURSELF! Sign the petition to pledge to boycott Your ISP, AND request the resignation of Ajit Pai!](http://chn.ge/2zgjW8o)

I hate to say it, but if this doesn't work, you might as well consider your Net Neutrality gone. The petition to the White House is nice, but it lacks a pledge and a call to action. Beyond that, Trump appointed Pai. This is Pai's entire purpose.
$C: You can also actively terrorize the people who made these decisions.

America was built on terrorism (what would you have called the Boston Tea Party?), so I think it's fair to cut FCC member's cable lines and otherwise vandalize their property.

They want to fuck up our internet, why can't we fuck up theirs?

Is it against the law? Sure. Sometimes breaking the law is the right thing to do. 
$C: I think it's time for literal torches.  Our Democratic institution is no longer listening to public opinion because they don't think we have the power.  We do.  Fuck Pai, Fuck the FCC, and fuck our impotent government.
$C: If you can and are willing, consider visiting your House Rep.'s office: An in-person visit and conversation will leave a deeper impression on the legislator's staff. You're not likely to get to speak to the legislator themself, but their staffers, especially if you ask for and get their legislative director, help shape a legislator's world view and actions, and our goal is to let them know their constituents care deeply about net neutrality. You'll find that the people at the office will be very nice to you and not at all antagonistic, after all, they want your support! You may also find that your Rep. has an office conveniently near you or your commute!

Some additional tips:

When talking to a congressional office, there are 3 key pieces of info you want to make sure you get across (the ones with decent staff will ask you for the info, but some of them slack): Your name+your address (so they know you're an individual in their district), the issue you care about and which side of it you're on.

In addition to talking to the staffers, every congressional office I've been to (and I've been to lots) will have a form you can fill out where you can write down your concerns. Be sure to ask for the form and write down your support for net neutrality!

Congressional offices are almost always open 9-5, weekdays.

The truism "the squeaky wheel gets the grease" applies. Our goal here is to squeak loudly for net neutrality, and if possible, squeak in person!
$C: Good bot
$C: Good bot, but also operates under the assumption that the people receiving these letters give a damn.  In their world they either don't care, or they think they know better than you... the bungled and botched.
$C: this should be posted on r/kratom they could really use this service! 
$C: I wanted to add to this:

Don't just leave a message. Write an E-Mail to request a meeting. You can sit down with your elected representatives and discuss the topic. An example is I can meet Chuck Grassely allows for 15 minutes.

I would suggest under the topic discussion selecting "Economy". They are much more receptive to set up a meeting in a timely manner.

----

If I can get a meeting with Chuck Grassley and discuss this, I am sure you can meet your reps. Good luck everyone, and finish the fight!

Keep up the good work
$C: I have a question, couldn’t theoretically everyone just boycott the internet until companies start losing money and realize this isn’t acceptable? Wouldn’t that lead to going back into net neutrality? Via companies possibly going bankrupt and the government needling to bail them out and just a huge commotion? Real crazy thought. But that’s my thought and question.
$C: Can I get a template to send them about net neutrality?
$C: I have. I've been 100% against it and my representatives are perfectly aware.
$C: It isn't over yet.

$C: Also- don't stop at just the internet, protect your rights across other media!! So-called "a la carte" proposals in Congress are threatening Channel Neutrality on TV and this is being swept under the rug
$C: What does a bot do with gold? 🤔
$C: Yeahhhh cause that's been working!
$C: Let’s turn our attention to the real perpetrators of the internet (which is not the isp’s) but google, Facebook, and twitter etc... they are the ones that need to be regulated! They are doing more damage to society that any business in history! We are just now starting to realize the damage they are doing and they don’t care because it’s about money. On top of that they were the ones spending millions to save net neutrality why not because it harms businesses but because they don’t want anyone to be able to disrupt there business goals. These companies hate isp’s because they are the last line of defense against them controlling everything internet related. Oh and google tried to become a nationwide isp so they could cut of the middleman (isp’s) but they have realized it’s not worth the trouble. Google said they wanted to bring cheap fast internet to all but why? So they can continue capturing your personal data and getting ad revenue. Pure greed. These companies are wolves guarding the hen the hen house and need to be broken up and regulated for society’s sake. But nothing will ever happen because they have more money and lobbyists than any company has ever had before. And they will send bots to drown any uprising out of reddit and they will control the narrative. 
$C: Oh fuck off, writing does nothing.
$C: What about donating money? It seems like talking to representatives who don't give a shit what you have to say isn't going anywhere. What organizations are actually spending time trying to combat this shit? 
$C: What if I'm Canadian?

Bots in Vladivostok and Beijing aren't citizens 
$C: No duh?
$C: You are correct we are a Republic.
$C: You and me both.  He just has a face and smile that screams “I know I’m an asshole.”
$C: oh man his fucking demeanor is nauseating. I just wish I could donate to somebody who would stand outside of his house 24/7/365 blasting Friday by Rebecca Black 
$C: they have bomb dogs sniffing room now, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d_202l55LU&app=desktop, or did
$C: Bomb threat?
$C: The plot thickens
$C: You missed an m in your link. Correct link [here](https://twitter.com/TheAnonJournal?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).
$C: I can't really say I'm surprised, at all.
$C: That's how NN was imposed in the first place.

Ajit Pai moved the issue to congress -- where you actually get to vote for your senators and representatives. It should have never been a decision of any regulatory board, but a law passed by representatives of the people.
$C: **Money**
$C: Because in capitalism, a few people have all the power and wealth, and the rest don't. It's ridiculous.
$C: Because protests don't do shit.
$C: Isn't CRA for removing rules like NN?  Not reinstating them?
$C: [Hypocrisy, that's what it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFpbRlIfowM)

In all seriousness, Ajit Pai is probably the biggest hypocrite I've ever seen.
$C: Seriously this. I also liked how he thinks accelerated mobile pages are comparable to promoted tweets? lmao
$C: Have you read the bill itself?

The only reason you think internet providers can’t do that already is because reddit told you so. 
$C: > piece Ajit

FTFY.
$C: That's literally an insult to actual shit. 

At least shit has an actual fucking use to society as fertilizer. 
$C: surprise the verizon lawyer is such a puppet piece of shit. 
$C: Comcast is for it, that alone should scare any sane person off!
$C: I know, who in their right mind would nominate this clown for the FCC?
$C: Well said 
$C: Guy speaking now says we shouldn't be worried because our fears are only "hypothetical"

$C: > Mentions of "baseless fear-mongering", "false arguments", and "baseless imagination". 

More actually "shit that already happened so we had to enact regulations to stop it"
$C: Clearly the fcc are the ones with false arguments and lies... 
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves. Violence was part of equal rights for Race and Gender. Violence stopped the Nazis and saved millions of lives. Violence created our Country and maintained it. It is a tool and in some situations it is the best tool for the job. This is one of those situations because all other avenues have been exhausted and the powers of the government themselves are being abused So there it is. There is the solution.     

I know you all won't listen and I know we will lose the internet because of it. I hope your ego and pretentious morality was worth us losing one the greatest wonders of the human world. My resentment is no longer just for the corrupt human garbage that pushed against Net Neutrality, but also now for all of you who allowed it to happen just because you didn't want to get dirty to clean up the filth.    

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: I mean the fear-mongering has been a little silly. Let's be honest, worst case scenario we all pay more for internet...there are so many things in the world worse than that.
$C: Oh no. At least we can still "gram" about it. 
$C: This gon be good
$C: Implying the USA isn't already pretty much an oligarchy with a democratic mask...
$C: http://bigthink.com/scotty-hendricks/why-socrates-hated-democracy-and-what-we-can-do-about-it
$C: As much as I'm all for this, that's not possible in my area. I live in a rural town and the only real provider here is Comcast, so if I want internet access, I have to go through them.
$C: How? Nobody is going to cancel their phone plan or ISP as an act of protest.
$C: This sounds impossible. Please explain
$C: This would be a grand idea, if some of he's companies didn't have a monopoly in the area.

I know that if and when they start their extra fees, people then will become outraged... Only to have nowhere to turn to.
$C: Start with Verizon. They're the easiest to impact since there is actual competition in the cellular market.
$C: And I’d absolutely jump right into that bandwagon *if it were possible.* 

It’s not. I couldn’t do school. I couldn’t do my job (work from home). They know that the internet isn’t just a “perk” anymore, and they are abusing their control over it. 
$C: Nobody is going to cancel out of their plans because of fees related to cancellation. This is hopeful but not very logical
$C: They we going to push ahead even if the building was on fire. They wanted it repealed as soon as possible and as under the radar of the normal public. There's a reason they voted on this so close to the holidays when everyone's minds are distracted with commercialism. 
$C: You want them to push ahead. It makes them more corrupt and easier to nail
$C: I'm against this faux "net neutrality" movement and am not bought and paid for. Where do I go for my payout? 
$C: There are video streaming services that deliver VR content. Just saying.
$C: Don't make the mistake to assume Pai is clueless. He's a bald-faced liar. He knows exactly what he's saying.
$C: He's far from being an idiot, he knows people are idiot and with some shiny words he can confuse them more. 

As much as I hate him the guy has 100% of his brain functionning.
$C: THIS!
$C: i loved the comment on bitcoin, like that dumbass knows anything about bitcoin.
$C: Me too.  I've been subsidizing everyone else's piracy by paying for software since '89.  I even paid WinAmp ffs.  Paid for every Windows distro too.  Music, movies, games - all actually purchased.

That is officially over.
$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzcv5TJkJBA
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY1fUAPYH3M
$C: They'll throttle the torrential sites/addresses. 
$C: Yo, my etherum position is going to flourish. Internet 3.0, here we come! No central servers, no throttling.
$C: I imagined a tiny pirate doing a little jig when I read your last sentence. 
$C: wait...the two Dems are women? Wow.
$C: women *are* the fucking revolution, man. i keep fucking saying it. 
$C: I really hope they're all safe. Last thing we need are innocents getting hurt, or worse the chairmen turned into a martyr for his cause. 
$C: I don't think many people are actually in favor of it.  More like they just don't care either way.  Not everyone uses the internet a bunch except for when they are at work.  NN simply doesn't affect their lives much.
$C: http://bigthink.com/videos/salman-rushdie-how-an-anti-intellectual-elite-are-turning-the-world-upside-down
$C:  Net neutrality has only been a thing for the past 2 years, and the internet now is the exact same as it was before 2015. These doomsday scenarios that everyone has been talking about will not happen. They have had 20 years to happen. Why would they start now?
$C: They likely will be ordered not to though.
$C: I want to see Ajit Pai arrested 
$C: I was about to disagree then I googled Oligarchy and it does ring true....though instead of it being a single Oligarchy its more like two Oligarchy's fighting for control.
$C: We definitely need more options though. Even if the Democrats are better on most things, anything they agree with Republicans on forces all of us to accept it (e.g., military actions & budget, blocking third parties, greater executive power). 
$C: It’s a republic, but rather a corrupt one at that. 
$C: Because money.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Because capitalism.
$C: They'll probably restart in a few minutes... interesting though. Maybe it's getting rowdy outside?
$C: Current ISPs lobby so much they are granted a monopoly making the barrier for entry extremely high for potential new ISPs. I hope you're right but I don't see it changing in the near future.

$C: Don't forget Trump, he's the one who put them in place.
$C: Hahahahahaha...

_Seems like_.
$C: >Ajit Pai ~~seems like~~ **IS** a massive cunt

FTFY
$C: He should kick the chair.
$C: Yeah I wonder how many shares of Verizon Inc he still owns, seeing how he used to be Assoc General Counsel for them.  "...where he handled competition matters, regulatory issues, and counseling of business units on broadband initiatives."  Sm-gd-h...
$C: Cause of corruption our government isnt functioning too well, we will have to go through some reform before we can get it back to working like a good country again, just gotta give it some time.

$C: > Your government is not functioning well.

Well, perhaps not for the average government consumer, but for those companies willing to purchase the premium government package offered by the Republican Party it functions very well.
$C: Corruption, and the system was initially designed to only represent those who were deemed 'worthy' by the limits of technology at the time.
$C: http://bigthink.com/neurobonkers/chinas-radical-plan-to-gamify-social-control
$C: I dont know how to break it to you but capitalism isn't the only economic system that is corrupt. But otherwise, yes. Our government is fucked up.
$C: Trump and his party bluntly dont care for the people
$C: This political system is so weird. 
$C: Im gonna get downvoted to hell for this, but net neutrality is pretty far down on the reasons why I vote for a party
$C: > Ajit Pai is an Obama appointee. So, what's your argument there? 


$C: Fuck you Ajit Pai you FCC piece of shit
$C: Fuck 3/5s of the FCC. So far the two Dems have voted against this vote.
$C: You mean republicans. The fcc protected net neutrality until the gop took it over.
$C: No, you can thank everyone who voted for Trump. This was part of his manifesto. 

And Hillary was on record many times that she would leave it well alone. Also dems have consistantly voted for net neutrality.

This is exclusively on Trump voters and republicans.
$C: An eloquent and well thought out rebuttal. 
$C: Security theater.  A timely warning, to put the pro-net neutrality camp on the defensive.  Makes it look as if they've been threatened.
$C: How about none of those things?
$C: Probably someone in favor of Net Neutrality.
$C: Come on 4chan, use your evil powers for good, you have done it in the past, do it again!
$C: Might have.

The stream just got shut down due to a security reason.

Then the stream stopped with someone shouting or whatnot.
$C: Isn't 4chan busy MAGAing themselves to death while the fat old dinosaurs rob the country? 
$C: Try committing perjury before congress and see how fast a regular citizen ends up in prison.
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves. Violence was part of equal rights for Race and Gender. Violence stopped the Nazis and saved millions of lives. Violence created our Country and maintained it.

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: He literally lied through his teeth. 
$C: Don’t be racist
$C: I prefer to keep my free speech thank you very much.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Well the problem is most republicans are uneducated. They are very old school when it comes to religion so the republicans appeal to them. The few educated Republicans i met don't give a shit about beliefs and just vote republican cause it benefits the wealthy 
$C: Yup

Voting an orange Oompa Loompa into office(A whole slew of issues with him but that would probably be longer than the amount of text allowed per post), attempting to elect a pro slavery pedophile to the senate, Oompa Loompa administration lying to the FBI, taking away basic human rights, a tax bill with literally a bunch of scribbles in it, and much more I’m too lazy to write out.

But what am I saying, DAE #maga CNN fake news?
$C: Yeah because when Obama was president, things were so great. 

It doesn't have to do with parties. It has to do with corporations running our government.
$C: I've never have and (most likely) never will vote Republican, but it was Obama who appointed Ajit Pai in 2012


$C: Its only that way because people keep voting in people that only care about money. When people stop voting for Republicans that behave this way we'll be much better off.
$C: the real truth here. America is dead
$C: Somebody with some common sense
$C: Having a charlatan used-car salesman cartoon character (http://lanceschaubert.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/trump-tower-las-vegas-nv-1024x541.jpeg) for a president didn't clue you into that yet?
$C: Congress is sufficient. We don't need it in the constitution any more than other utilities (electricity etc).
$C: Yes, along side the right to free exercise of religion, right to self preservation, right to life, liberty and property, right to a free and fair public trial, right to vote irrespective of race or sex, there should be an amendment forcing internet service providers to conform to the regulations and restrictions set forth by the oh-so-holy government.

That wouldn't be a perversion of the founders' legacy at all, would it?
$C: Okay, no, _that's_ a little far.
$C: Come on, buddy, we'll adapt and we'll fight. The situation sucks, but where there's life there's hope, right?
$C: I miss the days when I thought the government was a force for good. In like five years I went from pride in my country to believing the government is full of evil. 
$C: Every day we're one step closer to the collapse of the United States, come to Canada 🇨🇦 
$C: I know how you feel. I honestly dont know whats going to happen in the future, or how this will be fought, but as long as we draw breath we must fight on. 
$C: Hey man, The entire world isnt terrible.  You should consider maybe traveling a bit.  Maybe move somewhere you think you could be happy.  Sorry if I sound a bit preachy, but I lost a friend of mine recently who made a post that started with that exact same sentence.  
$C: I really wish that those in power would open their eyes and really see the suffering they are causing.

It's not about what makes sense economically for a few. I see posts like yours all the time. I feel your pain.

I will make them understand your pain.

Before all is said and done, I will make them understand what true suffering feels like.
$C: Seriously, I absolutely despise my extended family for voting for that moron. Usually I don't politics influence family ties, but FUCK MY FAMILY. I will NEVER forgive them for what their ignorance has done to this country.
$C: What changes in healthcare caused you to lose it?
$C: This is your world too. I am bringing a child into this world, and I'm scared to death about the things she will deal with, but there's still hope in young people. They will still be here, thinking for themselves, when these despicable fucks are rotting in gilded graves.
$C: At this point no amount of suicide hotline calls will stop me from getting out of this hellhole. 
$C: It might look very bleak right now, but we are all going to fight and the one thing I do know, is that eventually things change for the better. The old saying, if you get knocked down, just dust yourself off and get back up. No matter how many times you get knocked down. You can do it!
$C: Still not as big of a scumbag as Grandpa Joe. Fuck that guy. 
$C: > I lost my health care after Trump took office

The only thing Trump has done with healthcare so far was remove the penalty for you not having healthcare. 
$C: I lost my healthcare when Obama made it affordable. So, there's that....
$C: How did your taxes go up?
$C: No one is forcing you to live in this world...
$C: lol
$C: do it pussy
$C: Lmfao
$C: [deleted]
$C: Soon you will have nothing to lose but your chains, and a world to win!
$C: Jesus, Reddit is so dramatic. That was a pretty amusing read. Thank you for that!
$C: If you really believe any of this nonsense above your a weirdo. Low unemployment rate, lower taxes, more "affordable" healthcare, less government regulations. America truly is a better place than it was a year ago if it weren't for all the oppositionists spewing lies.
$C: This is the most melodramatic website on the internet.
$C: [deleted]
$C: That's when you join the resistance. Amazingly the US doesn't even have one yet, the complacency is ridiculous. 
$C: This is glorious pasta!
$C: How did you lose your healthcare?
$C: Stop being so melodramatic, you live an unimaginable good life which 99% of people couldn't dream of, you even own a business for gods sake.
$C: What’s your online business? I do digital marketing for some NBA teams, I’d be glad to give some free advice.
$C: It's not over! Don't give up. These fucks want us to roll over and take it. Don't.
$C: You live in a backwards country, if it's this bad for you then consider leaving 
$C: I feel you man. But don't let them win.
$C: Dude, you should get some help. 
$C: I mean we voice our opinions and all for what? the whole point of all of this is to slowly break our will to fight and honestly it's just about done it... 
$C: Genuinely curious:  what happened with your healthcare situation?
$C: You will be blamed by your kids for ruining their lives, the cycle will continue. 
$C: Loser! Sad!
$C: Right there with you buddy. I used to want to have children to pass on my legacy to, but at this point why the fuck would I be so selfish as to bring another human into this shithole of a place we live in. 
$C: >I lost my health care after Trump took office

How and why?

>our taxes are going to go up when we could already barely afford them

Again, how and why?

>Internet is going to block people from my online store"?" and deny me business.

Unless you are Amazon, you have nothing to worry about.
$C: lol
$C: Your taxes aren’t going up unless your extremely rich. And if you own your own business the new tax law is actually IN your favor. Also, last I checked Obamacare hasn’t been replaced or repealed. And the battle for net neutrality still isn’t over. Comments like these do nothing but create dissenting opinions from the spread of misinformation and analysis.
$C: They don't deserve to be in office and seem to only survive via dirty tricks.

$C: I hope you realize this election being shitty was very much a bipartisan issue. Tons of folks were swayed to Trump's side by the various scandals surrounding Hillary, namely the one where the DNC was caught helping her win the primaries over Bernie.

That being said, I was personally hoping for a split government. I was disappointed to see it become monochromatic, but I didn't realize at the time just how bad it'd be.
$C: Fuck you dude. Im conservative and support net neutrality, theyre not mutually exclusive. Quit acting like people like me dont exist.
$C: [it seems like it doesn’t really matter who we vote for...](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/11/16746230/net-neutrality-fcc-isp-congress-campaign-contribution) 
$C: Your progressives are funded by Comcast. Who do you think signs Rachel Maddow's checks? Who owns big stakes in Vox and BuzzFeed? All Comcast. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Yeah, because elections always put people in office who actually represent the electorate! /s

None of them care. Get out of here with the voting bullshit. It won't ever change.
$C: lol, as if progressives will get rid of it.  If the GOP are out, then these companies will throw their money at the progressives instead.  
$C: Progressives are cancer. Net neutrality is great but don't be a single issue voter. 
$C: No thanks, #MAGA 

Edit: Thanks for all the love soyboys let’s see if we can break 100 😘❤️
$C: We could keep using most of the existing _software_ infrastructure, like IP (Internet Protocol), but we'd have to build a new system of _physical_ connections, which is prohibitively more expensive and difficult -- mostly because Comcast and the like have been fighting against that too, to dissuade people from setting up their own ISPs. So the real answer is "theoretically possible, but very unlikely".
$C: Sure

Maybe we can ask Comcast and Verizon for the $200 Billion the American tax-payer has given them over the last 10 years to "Provide broad-band to all Americans" that they haven't done anything with?

We could probably create a pretty awesome internet that money  
$C: Possible, yes. But very hard with only a tiny chance for success.
$C: Yes, but it would involve starting your own ISP and taking over all of America with your ISP, then enforcing your own net neutrality...
$C: Run a cable to your neighbor, you now have your own Interconnected Network.  You'll be lacking some services you're used to having, but it's all yours - well, yours and your neighbor's.  Hopefully you get along and can agree on usage policies :)
$C: http://mashable.com/2017/04/24/is-silicon-valley-new-internet-possible-or-not/#wSb65Qkn7Pqs
$C: It would have to be an easy and relatively easy port for major websites, so it's a very small chance. Our best hope is a court challenge leading to an overturn of the decision
$C: I keep thinking that a new Internet built on the backbone of existing wireless infrastructure as a mesh network would be a very interesting approach. The throughput would never be as good as with hardline infrastructure, it would only be feasible within urban or suburban areas, and it would require new infrastructure (or piggyback on top of existing hardline infrastructure) to bridge the gaps between those areas. The other major hurdle, of course, would be getting a critical density of people to install on their existing wireless routers the technically complex routing firmware necessary that would need to be developed and then hardened to actually make this work.

Latency probably wouldn't be great unless a hardline backbone were still maintained. 

One advantage of this approach is that it would 100% require end-to-end encryption on *all* connections, because instead of a few ISPs functioning as the middleman, there would be no telling who would be passing along (and have the ability to inspect) your traffic.

It's a crazy scheme, and it would probably never be able to equal the pure speed of the existing approach to Internet infrastructure. But it's about the only way we'll ever have a chance of having the Internet realize the dream of a truly decentralized medium of communication.
$C: Sure, but the easier option is just to not live in the US.
$C: If you have like, a trillion dollars.  That might actually not be enough.  Anyway, you don't need a new internet.  You just need a means of accessing it that won't screw you over.  Hope Elon's plan works out.
$C: Best bet would be someone like Google compeating with Comcast and Verizon or doing free WiFi in cities 
$C: This is a question I would love to see answered.
$C: The solution is actually very simple.

Mandate line-sharing for all lines into customer premises.  Boom, you now have perfect competition between ISPs and Net Neutrality doesn’t matter one bit.
$C: A new start with Ethereum.
$C: No one's stopping you. Have at it.
$C: We can call it the Timmy!
$C: /r/darknetplan
$C: r/meshnet and r/darknetplan are subs dedicated to discussing and implementing the growth of decentralized meshnets, it would seem.

The idea is certainly a lot more palatable in the face of this vote. I've personally been learning everything I can about setting up and growing a meshnet. 
$C: That would be the dream....... 
$C: not without investing a massive amount in a parallel infrastructure or seizing control of what exists already from the big ISPs that want this garbage.
$C: [deleted]
$C: That's going to happen when humans start living on Mars.
$C: TL;DR: Republicans
$C: Trump said he'd do this. People voted for him anyway. They decided it was less important than "build the wall" or "triggered libs" or whatthefuckever.
$C: Don't say no one. I've been arguing with someone in discord for days who I use to respect. They wanted this. They truly believe "NN is hindering growth" and "the free market works". Even though before NN we were being fucked. But OK. 
$C: Republicans voted these people in. Conservatives have always adopted anti-internet policies.

The voters knew this before voting.
$C: Thank you. Writing a fucking letter isn't going to do anything especially when corporations own them. The only way to truly do anything is vote. Get out and fucking vote.
$C: Money. Money will influence them. We need to pool together and buy them.
$C: Exercising the 2nd Amendment would be the best way to cut the bullshit out real quick.

How about we get rid of the ISP monopolies instead of handing more power the government that enabled them.
$C: Was this Congress voting on this?
$C: How about you do some research instead of reading headlines on reddit all day. I mean the top comment in this is someone telling you to download the internet and go buy a bunch of 5TB HDD's. This is who you are listening to. 
$C: /r/killthosewhodisagree
$C: I just want people to stop spreading the obviously false rumor of how Ajit Pai raped and murdered four teenage girls in 1998. He would never do something like that. Ajit Pai did not rape and murder four teenage girls in 1998.
$C: "So little benefit"
He's going to get millions or billions for the rest of his life from the companies, it's big

Though I'm 100% with you, I'll make him eat his teeth afterwards
$C: FYI-- Obama nominated Ajit Pai to the FCC
$C: Switching players wont change the game.

$C: YES RIOT! GO DESTROY YOUR CITIES THEN ASK THE GOVERNMENT FOR MONEY TO REBUILD. Tell me how ferguson is doing. Pretty sure from the last update everything is still burnt and empty and nothing is being done about it. Ghetto.
$C: exactly. It prevented Trump from being sworn into office, and it will work again now!
$C: They're not retarded, they're bought out. They represent the views of those who fund them. Corporate greed becomes legislative greed really quickly in a system like this
$C: Monopoly®
$C: As someone who previously voted R in the past, **never again**. 
$C: We'd have no politicians if they had to take a test like that.
$C: The entire earth would be unqualified if we had to make sure people weren't retarded, but that's besides the point
$C: Lets replace everyone in congress with scientists...........though that could lead to some problems.
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves. Violence was part of equal rights for Race and Gender. Violence stopped the Nazis and saved millions of lives. Violence created our Country and maintained it. It is a tool and in some situations it is the best tool for the job. This is one of those situations because all other avenues have been exhausted and the powers of the government themselves are being abused So there it is. There is the solution.     

I know you all won't listen and I know we will lose the internet because of it. I hope your ego and pretentious morality was worth us losing one the greatest wonders of the human world. My resentment is no longer just for the corrupt human garbage that pushed against Net Neutrality, but also now for all of you who allowed it to happen just because you didn't want to get dirty to clean up the filth.    

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: Seems like somebody called in a bomb threat, considering the dogs.
$C: Well, in this particular case (meaning this disgusting vote), it's dealing with regulating the internet (or, more specifically, the behavior of ISPs) in the United States... so yeah, our government does have the power to do that. This vote won't affect anyone outside of the US. 

I do find it perversely amusing that the FCC used the word "utility" for the internet (a word that many who support this travesty of "democracy" refuse to use, preferring to call internet a "luxury"), admitting that yes, it is a utility... so why the hell won't they regulate it like one since they admit that it is one? There *is* such a thing as light touch regulation...

But to stay on the topic of your question, I'm pretty sure that as of last year, the US doesn't control the internet anymore--and for exactly the reason you gave (that was brought up numerous times by other nations). Our government finally "handed the keys" as it were--or began the process, at least--over to ICANN, which has an advisory committee that's like the UN for the internet and almost as many observers. ICANN's board of directors is drawn from that international membership. At least, that's how it was supposed to happen. Whether it did or not... yeah.
$C: You’re giving USA too much credit. We hardly will notice the change in the rest of the world, unless other countries take notice and think: hey, if they can pull it off...
$C: Maybe another retarded "rage at the sky" day will help your offended feels. Change your tampon. 
$C: Giving citizens the idea that they have freedom... Yet we have none. 
$C: to elect representatives and then have those representatives make 'the big decisions.'

You literally just watched it in action. If you dont like how the big decisions are being made, you get active, you promote what you think is right, and then you vote.

The point of Democracy is to NOT have violence in the streets, threats of violence as political discourse, and petulant critiques of why a form of government is terrible when things dont go my way.
$C: America is coming to a tipping point. Anybody can plain as day see that this is only gonna get worse.
$C: Telecom companies do not own your voice.
$C: sorry they dont. Are you dumb?
$C: Theres a small chance of survival if theres a body of water at the bottom, lets make it 2000ft. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Whatever country you live in, make sure you watch for this. If it becomes implemented here it will slowly try and spread to the rest of the world 
$C: Well they aren't, but not all Republicans are against NN. Maybe in terms of Republicans VS Democrats in political positions, there would be more Republicans against NN, but the majority of Republicans are for NN.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Obama appointed this guy at the advice of Mitch McConnell. It's all public. 
$C: This is amazingly racist.
$C: Ill keep feeding quarters into the Internet meter they just installed next to my cable modem. Shit, hang on I need to get some ch
$C: I think freedom to contract is a big issue too
$C: Shaw,Rogers,Telus,Bell all want to get rid of NN in Canada. 

Canada is way worse, trust me. Our internet in Canada is already throttled/blocked. 

The cost of our internet is ridiculous too... 10mb down / 10mb up is around $60 a month 

Our phone plans are even worse
$C: can you elaborate how?
$C: This is insane, what is happening down there??
$C: WaPo's feed is still on.
$C: Please, as a non-American, I want to hear your interpretation of what Net Neutrality currently is, what it means, and why having Net Neutrality rolled back (before it existed in 2015) is a negative.
$C: The tech gap made it so there is no way to fight the system. Even if there were, outside forces would swoop in in no time and enforce the current system. Then shit would get real strict real fast...

That would be a loss loss situation. Though you are right, we don’t have true freedom. The people are ignored. Supreme Court already stared“money equals free speech”, not liberty or base rights.

Edit: also trying to fight Or revolt like you suggest would just get a lot of innocents killed and being the nation into a lockdown state. Let us not do that.
$C: I knew I wasn't the only one who thought that
$C: did you call in a bomb threat by any chance?
$C: Spoiler: he wont.

He absolutely should obviously, but.. he wont
$C: Remember the Civil part of civil disobediency, dont be like ANTIFA or actually cause riots or other things that cause people to not be able to earn dosh.
$C: What people need to do is start revolting.
$C: Republican politicians have no incentive to care about people who will never vote for them. They have realised all they need is a plurality of the people to vote for them.
$C: Can't we creat our own internet service that is neutral? Yeah it would need a tremendous amount of capital to get it started but this community is big enough. Could you imagine a neutral affordable and reliable internet service for the people by the people?
$C: What’s with all the racists in here today?
$C: So you're not a conservative. Please stop calling yourself a conservative when you're not. Call yourself a feminist, communist, leftist, socialist, but please don't misrepresent yourself.
$C: After reading your history I think you always were a left leaning shill to begin with.
$C: Where do you live? I'm job hunting right now in fact, I could replace you if you want.
$C: That's free speech for you!
$C: Yeah, and the superdelegates don't vote until July.
$C: Yeah but it was always gonna be 3 to 2. This is what they wanted, now they can write their own Net Neutrality legislation that will benefit the corporations.
$C: Yes. This post was a tad premature 
$C: [deleted]
$C: I will happily invest in the people's internet. I'm not a technical person so unsure how it would work,but I would love to see some kind of co-op local internet service for my community instead of the two corporations providing us garbage service at the moment.
$C: 

>Buy our OWN satellites

You mean buy and lay your own thousands of miles of intercontinental cabling? Either way sounds like all you want is for someone to start a new internet business and everyone here to invest in it. Or do you really think you can magically crowdfund your own internet infrastructure? 
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves.

$C: Shit never works lol
$C: Comcast already removed their promise not to throttle traffic and block websites.
$C: I currently use the only other option I have other than Comcast. It sucks because its clearly inferior but I absolutely refuse to do business with Comcast.

Before today I thought I hated them because of their customer service and lack of improvements. I was excited to learn that the only reason they were terrible was because of the Obama Administrations heavy handed regulations. I can't wait to see their improvements so I can switch over to them.
$C: Not sure what the plan is... But as far as building their infrastructure....It won't be happening in Central TX... They're laying off a lot of techs...

Things will get better and small ISPs will be able to compete now
$C: Was a bomb threat, they brought the dogs in to check.
$C: > I think there should be a full investigation into the bot/disappearing comments

What happened? 
$C: no, because Net Neutrality isn't a law - it's a policy.
$C: Get my healthcare back?!

how? obamacare made healthcare unaffordable for all unemployed middle class Americans
$C: When was healthcare taken away?

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: Let's not forget how they basically f-ed a good ton of the Education system. Teachers & Students alike use the internet to educate students & educate themselves respectively.
So on top of f-ing over basically every American who uses the internet, they also f-ed over education.
$C: Actually it wasn’t overwhelmingly. 60-40 is still bad not what I would call overwhelmingly. 
$C: Key word being *tried*. the fact that the Democrat won (by popular vote!) in a deep south state is something to get excited about. Republicans are shitting their pants and desperate to win back voters now that they've lost what used to be a guaranteed seat in the Senate.
$C: But he lost? Now is the time to congratulate the people of Alabama for doing the right thing, not spit in their face. 
$C: Your subscription to "ComcastFast - for games and streaming" is about to expire. Would you like to renew? It's only an extra $30 per month for super low pings for your first 15 hours of gaming and streaming a month! Speed reduction after 15 hours can be avoided with just a small $10 microtransaction. You know, like the ones in the games you love so much! 
$C: This is the part where I download all the emulators and games I can before I have to play offline games for a few years. Maybe I can ride out the time between today and when Net Neutrality becomes a thing again. Or entertain myself while I prepare to move my family out of the country.
$C: No nothing of the sort will happen. This NN is a load of shit youre being sold.
$C: PLEASE DRINK A VERIFICATION CAN TO CONTINUE.
$C: No, it's all bullshit scaremongering.
$C: Dude is 100% bought and paid for puppet, he's not even human.

$C: > Our last hope lies with Congress

Um...So we're fucked then. Got it
$C: Actually, you are not being dramatic. This actually is a war. Or perhaps worse than that because in war, you have a fair chance to win. 
They are winning against 83% of the population. 
$C: It is a war, you are absolutely right. Prepare your forces.
$C: Most people who were in opposition of it either was being paid or WOEFULLY misinformed about the issue and the nutty part is when this gets implemented then they'll start to care.
$C: When hyperbole has more volume than actual common sense....
$C: And yet Russia doesn't and has jail time for certain speech violations online... but sure, Russia rabble rabble rabble.
$C: Peak Accelerationism 
$C: l o l

Hacker uprising

reddit liberals never cease to amaze...
$C: The people lobbying their own government... is a new level of irony.
$C: We could afford one politician, maybe two. Companies like Comcast can buy entire political parties.
$C: As much as people like to complain about lobbyists, as a concept lobbying isn't a problem. It's enshrined in the constitution even. Groups like the ACLU or Amnesty International employ lobbyists also. 

The major issue here is that conservatives actually don't give a fuck. If you showed up with a bag full of money and threw it at Pai he still wouldn't give a fuck. Why? Because the issue is ideological with them. They think government regulation hurts society. Part of it is their own obvious corrupt tendencies, sure. But the republicans actually believe that unrestricted capitalism is a good thing. And people keep ignoring that elephant in the room. 

These people get into power with the intention of gutting the regulatory power of the government, that's what they believe in. They aren't going to stop believing in it just because they got some angry letters.  
$C: Wasn't Pai appointed by Obama to the FCC though?
$C: In the face or the dick idk which one you mean
$C: Same
$C: We're fucked, we lost boys hope you have the money to access a censored internet.
$C: Bring it. 
$C: Would be easier if Democrats would actually run a good candidate.
$C: A perfect illustration of tribalism, too. One year ago today, that sub was *fully* supportive of NN. He really could shoot someone on 5th avenue. They would be horrified and confused for 15 minutes, then Hannity would say something about 'the attacker made a threatening move', and within the hour they would be celebrating the president's heroism and courage.
$C: Lol. Are you seriously talking about censoring a group in a discussion of net neutrality. That is quite incredible. 
$C: Hahaha you support NN but want to ban someone else for speaking out against is. HOLY SHIT. Talk about hypocritical.
$C: I would just like to say go fuck yourself for having such a despicable username
$C: Hi Soros!
$C: *de_dipshit ftfy
$C: > Hey they those guys are against free and open internet! LETS BAN THEM!

Do you just say shit like that without even thinking?
$C: Reddit has never provided a neutral ground for T_D, not even close to it. Why should we care for you?
$C: Did you even read the reasons why? No probably not. Keep parroting your bullshit.
$C: Yea, very confusing.
$C: someone who is in favor of Net Neutrality called in a bomb threat, because that's how Progressives think politics should work.
$C: They cut it off, right?

$C: Yeah wtf is going on? was watching it live.
$C: Probably because a lot of "tolerant" liberals want to kill them.
$C: Yes.
$C: bomb threat
$C: liberals cant play fair
$C: username checks out.
$C: Tolerant left
$C: F
$C: F
$C: f
$C: Upspezzed for cow dick 
$C: yeah let’s get a unground resistance group moving 
$C: Voting does work. It's just that we elected one party that campaigned on killing net neutrality.
$C: Sometimes I am wondering why you Americans have guns... Use 'em.
$C: If any Democrat were president they would've appointed a Democrat as FCC commissioner which would mean this didn't happen.
$C: He said during his campaign he was going to lock down that internet. He is doing what he promised, doesn't make him less of a self-serving traitor.

It's a hell of a thing to be able to tell people you are going to fuck them over and have them championing your decisions. The GOP have brainwashed their constituents in a truly impressive fashion. 
$C: > The United States is the best country to live in if you enjoy having your politicians fuck you over daily for their own benefits.

You ever been to Brazil? 
$C: >The saddest part is if Bernie were President he would shut this shit down asap.

Hillary too. She is firmly against repealing net neutrality.
$C: Hillary had it on per platform.  Bernie Sanders never had a chance at being president.
$C: You act like conservatives are single-issue voters with net neutrality as their sole focus. Get real
$C: Are you advocating censorship right now? Seriously? Did yu know that Ajit Pai was appointed to the the FCC by Obama?
$C: Hey, someone took a pic of your comment and post it on twitter.  I think you should have the FBI look into the dude twitter account. 
https://twitter.com/PNN_Unleashed/status/941442777224708096

I'm on it!
$C: As Dr Cox says, if they were to remove porn the only page left would be the bring back the porn page. 
$C: I'm all for net neutrality, but this is kind of insane. Chill.
$C: So this is the Internet's version of a Doomsday prepper.
$C: All I heard was download porn.
$C: Lemme know how to download a website lmao
$C: > The Information Age is over. Blahblah Deathpocalypse is here prepare to be eating canned beans in your nuclear fallout shelter.

Can Americans stop thinking they're the be all and end all of the fucking universe? You fucktards elected an idiot who supports idiot laws, and now those idiot laws are gonna make the price of your internet access rise a bunch. That doesn't mean that 99% of the fucking internet is being shut down tomorrow, and if you actually fucking vote in 2020 you can reverse it. Take a few fucking deep breaths for fucks sake.
$C: Nice fear mongering.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Lmao what the hell is this? Your opening lines and number 10 are directly contradicting each other.
$C: Seriously. What you need to do right now is calm down. You sound like those apocalypse nuts on the streets. Just read what you just wrote, one day you're going to read it again and feel ashamed of yourself. This isn't the end of the world, no need to lose your head over it. I assure you there is a life outside of internet. It's cool, you'll see.
$C: #6 is about the only sense any of this makes 
$C: jesus christ.  i can't believe you actually took the time to write all of that out.

"start downloading websites" lol wut?  

chill the fuck out.  
$C: Are you a complete idiot or just swept along in your bubble of doomsday preaching?
$C: I'm not the most tech-savvy person but how do you download a website? Doesn't it have to connect to the web to update? I could back up a snapshot of it, if that's what you mean, but I don't see the use of that...
$C: Reading this brought me so much joy. Oh Reddit...
$C: I admire, this guy's effort, seems like a movie tbh, really can't take this comment serious but you do have valid points but just seems so blown out of proportion, hoping as a UK citizen that the CRA comes into play. 
$C: [EVERYBODY PANIC!!!](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/glee/images/0/04/Oh-noes-everybody-panic.gif/revision/latest?cb=20130328215316)
$C: None of this shit is going to happen.. relax my dude lol
$C: incredible fear mongering here..."no isp wants to be seen supporting porn" really where did you read this at? 
$C: It really is nutjobs like this guy that detract from the argument for net neutrality. We all look crazy by association. 
$C: But where do I buy the tinfoil hats? 
$C: How someone could be so crazy/uninformed/wordy/paranoid is beyond me, but meth is a powerful drug.
$C: Thanks for the advice, but how soon do you think companies will start charging us?
$C: Condoning piracy in the name of a supporting cause is where you lost me. Stealing from those who likely had nothing to do with these changes and saying fuck my moral code because I'm getting fucked over by the government? Never. Maybe I'm the minority, but this all this shit sounds really exaggerated to me. 
$C: Lol chicken little
$C: This kind of misleading and irresponsible comment is borderline criminal.
$C: So dumb. 
$C: 11.  Move to a fully supported net neutrality jurisdiction like Canada.
$C: Are you fucking high? 

THE INTERNET HAS ALWAYS BEEN PAID FOR.  YOU DO NOT ACCESS THE INTERNET WITHOUT PAYING FOR DEVICES AND SERVICE THAT TAPS INTO THE INFRASTRUCTURE.  

Holy fuck some people are dumb. Is your tap water "free" too?  You pay taxes, a mortgage (or rent), fees to the state/city for water, / or you pay for maintenance on a well. 

To say that "the information age is over"  is absolutely ridiculous. You're fear-mongering and causing people to overreact.  Stop what you're doing.  Please.  
$C: Holy shit you're delusional. I can't wait until none of your predictions come true so I can laugh in your face. I am going to take some of your advice though. I'm going to be archiving all of the hysterical people like you so I can make fun of you in a year or so. 

See you in a year or so!
$C: I'm all for net neutrality, but dude you're acting a little crazy about it...It's bad, but the world is not ending
$C: [That](https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4252153/what-is-net-neutrality-isp-package-diagram.0.jpg) won't happen for another generation or so. They need the people who remember the free and wide internet to start dying off a little first before they can start restricting things. You need to make it into the norm by making sure people who remember these things don't stand around making a noise about it.
$C: How about showing the corporations behind this nonsense that you no longer support them. 

Cancel your subscriptions. Live without internet at home for a while. It’s not easy, but when corporations realize they no longer are making money because of net neutrality, they will pressure the government to reverse the decision. 

It’s literally the easiest, and best way to get this changed. 

Cancel your shit, and let them know you’ll consider resubscribing once the internet is neutral again. 
$C: That's the future of the United States, not for more progressive countries.

It's actually really sad watching the US empire fall. As a kid, I used to idealize the US, now it's like you guys are blind to the rest of the world and still think you're the best. 

China will soon be the new ruler, let's pray that they don't try to convert western countries to their practices and influence.

$C: Welp. Gotta start a list. Thanks
$C: Lol
$C: or you could emmigrate
$C: Mayaswell just stop using the internet and cancel our contracts with ISPs. Then they’ll lose profits and realise that this great shamble for money has led to them only losing money. We probably all need a break anyways.
$C: Being a bit dramatic there.
$C: As someone that grew up on C64 and 8086, worked on arm, Alpha, x64, IA64, and amd64, I'm afraid the golden age of computing and internet has passed at this point.  It's all been co-opted for locked down entertainment and fees.
$C: Yeah so if they cut out porn there would probably be riots in the streets. Just saying.
$C: You're delusional.
$C: haha wtf
$C: > Start downloading any websites

I stopped reading there. You have no clue what your even talking about
$C: Fear mongering. This post is just as bad as the people who say net neutrality is unnecessary. 
$C: None of this is going to happen and all that might happen is that you may have to pay a couple dollars more for your streaming services.
$C: >The sky is falling, the sky is falling!

Ok dude.
$C: lol just use a vpn mah dude
$C: 1 If you think every Internet provider is going to block 99% of websites your an idiot. Someone like Google would come along and start becoming an Internet provider and get quite literally all internet users to flock to them. 

2 Why an Internet Provider would block google drive is beyond me they would have to disclose this to the public and then people would switch providers. 

3 You can never really "take down" something from the internet somebody will always be able to find an archived version of that.

4 Again why would ISP's block sites like Wikipedia if Comcast did this who would keep them as their provider. You act like Internet Providers are all 1 single entity and no competition is allowed.

5 Why would an ISP care about what kind of porn you watch seriously why would they care the industry is huge and what provider wouldn't want a chunk of that money. 

6 This is literally the only good point made if your doing something illegal your ISP might stop you. Another ISP however, might not care so you can always switch your provider.

7 Again all it takes is 1 provider to go against what the others are doing and people will switch to them when they see the huge list of sites that are blocked or throttled which they would have to do by law. 

8 Why a VPN would be made illegal again is stupid but I do agree everyone should have one. VPN's also unravel nearly every point you've made. In your post-apocalyptic nightmare scenario, VPN's would circumvent all these restrictions which ISP's know so they wouldn't bother to throttle if they had to declare it publicly.

10 Exactly if any ISP tried to restrict certain sites there would be public outcry and the decision would be reversed in a week at the most.
$C: So..basically what you're saying is that the internet is fucked and we're all going to die? 

Ok.
$C:  Why not just take up arms and storm our governments, the FCC, and the ISPs, and demand that they give the people net neutrality? They obviously don't care about us. So why not MAKE them care about us? Surely they care more about their lives than they do money and power, right?
$C: Except none of these big scary things you're talking about happened before the year 2015. 
$C: This isn't the apocalypse. This is a gradual process that will likely be halted during its progression when courts and congress take action. 
$C: This is bad, but holy fuck, it's not nearly that awful. The Internet isn't being shut down. Newsflash: The USA isn't the only country in the world. If this goes all the way through, Internet prices for Americans will soar and you will probably be limited and censored, but it's not the "end of the Information Age". There are ways to fight back.

Stop being so dramatic. Calm down and think rationally.
$C: >The Information Age is over. The Internet will become pay-to-access and over 99% of all websites will be blocked or throttled    
    
*In the US.    
    
The EU has net neutrality laws. Enjoy your cable packaged internet America!
$C: Hey man could you tell me where to get a vpn?
$C: That would imply people actually getting up from their computers, going outside and putting together an organized event for longer than 15 minutes
$C: I want to riot, when and where?
$C: I can imagine it easily, because we've seen it every day for 30 years
$C: Those are completely different issues, though...? Net Neutrality isn't about selling our data, as that's commonplace with most sites nowadays. Net Neutrality is about not letting ISPs fuck us over even more.
$C: While selling meta-data to third parties and encouraging brands to astroturf reddit are problems, what is their tie in with net neutrality?

Net neutrality does not mean that every website on the internet needs to be neutral. It just means that ISPs can't limit your access to the internet or prioritize certain websites/services over others.

I don't see what is hypocritical about Reddit's stance. They are allowed to do what they want with their site and the information users give them and, due to net neutrality, we are allowed to not visit their site and go somewhere else if we don't agree with what they are doing.

What am I missing? 
$C: What's hypocritical about it? Sprinklr is a social listening tool that brands use to gauge interest and trends across social platforms. I'm in advertising and have used them before. There is no private information that they're gathering, it's all analyzing conversations you post publicly. Like it or not, Reddit is a company. They need to monetize in order to stay in business to provide you a service for no extra cost to you. Even if Reddit was supporting NN for completely selfish business reasons, who gives a shit? The ends justify the means.  
$C: Everyone should go [to reddit's personalization preferences](https://www.reddit.com/personalization?done=true) and make sure that all the settings are to their liking.  Hopefully that would be "unchecked." 
$C: Opt out...
$C: Your entire complaint has nothing at all to do with net neutrality.
$C: Much like an AMA - you won't get an answer to this question.
$C: I understand your concern and you have made a great counter argument with tons of good sources, props to you sir!  Unfortunately this sort of thing is bound to happen regardless of the net neutrality vote. Therefore, I'll put my personal privacy on the line in the fight to preserve the Internet for everyone. 
$C: Sprinklr was banned from reddit. 
$C: In other words, reddit partners with a marketing company. If you think that has anything to do with net neutrality, sorry, but you are an idiot.
$C: > selling our meta-data to third parties

The majority of your data on Reddit is public anyway.

Also, NN is a much bigger issue than a *single website* engaging in the behavior that you are alleging. If you don't like what Reddit is doing you can always use another website; if you don't like what your ISP is doing, in the vast majority of cases, tough.

This Sprinklr tirade is like screaming about not getting a red toy fire engine while mommy and daddy are having an argument about living on the streets.

> hypocritical

Them being hypocritical does not make them wrong. Please choose another topic to hang this crusade of yours off.
$C: You mean that thing that is the business model of all social media?

What reddit/Twitter/FB does (social platform to talk about shit) only exists to collect and sell data. I thought that was common knowledge.
$C: Plus the dude who moderates the Donald is leading the charge. How the Fuck did we get here? Oh, I know, Trump got elected.
$C: On top of that, like flickr, tumblr, and countless other copycats, they do the deeply irritating crime of using a word for their brand name but missing off the last "e".

$C: Good effort, but Sprinklr is a help desk solution which allows quick and unified interactions across all social media platforms and other customer service avenues. Big companies like Wyndham (millions of customers) use Sprinklr so I doubt very much there are no limitations in place regarding Sprinklr just walking in and scooping up everyone's personal information. And if there aren't, the implication that Reddit is intentionally hawking our personal data is unfounded. If Sprinklr is doing that, Reddit is a very small fish in very big water.
$C: >I find reddit hypocritical to be beating the net neutrality drum, while behind our backs you guys are selling our meta-data to third parties and encouraging brands to astroturf reddit.

Do you not remember spez and admins editing user's comments in ways that made it look like users were saying things they weren't? Do you not remember when it was proven that net neutrality gives reddit and the government the power to extinguish people via the ISP they don't agree with? With NN, you need a special license to be an ISP. and with that, the government can make the ISP not allow you to access anything it doesn't like. This was all stuff that was voted in slowly over many years and is 100% legal now. its pretty messed up and a huge ding to our 1st amendment rights. So... why would reddit want this so badly? Who knows...

Except he didn't talk about NN at all. 
$C: Whoever voted for trump is a fucking moron. He showed no values when he was running and shows none now. I don’t think he’s gonna last much longer and once 2018 rolls around, I think he’s gonna be over run by Dems. I hope he either dies suddenly or gets tired of being president and quits. 
$C: Yup, I hope if anything people learn that elections matter. 
$C: I mean, USA is a democratic republic, not a democary. 
$C: Congress can still fix this. We will not go down without a fight!!!!
$C: American, or democracy?

Pick one.
$C: reported to fbi for terrorism. enjoy gitmo fgt
$C: Calm down lady
$C: What did we do? Posted memes? Those fucks only understand one thing!
$C: No kidding. I’ve liked being fairly planted in the middle, but there’s no way I’ll ever vote right sided if this is the outcome regardless of who sits in office.  The blue’s got a new permanent voter on their side.
$C: bow fosho!
$C: it worked when it prevented Trump from being sworn into office, and it will work again now.

ps: I reported your post.
$C: Do not advocate violence.
$C: This is a republic. Not an anarchy.

I have the same sentiments, but the ideals of just, fair, and peaceful legislation must be stuck to.
$C: publicly calling for an assassination is a really bad plan.
$C: Only literally this time
$C: It'll be the same as it was before 2015. Educate yourself, sheep.
$C: The whole country lost, the corporations won. Make sure to vote against anyone who said 'yes' to this in 2018 :/
$C: What rights are being taken away, exactly?
$C: Yes I saw some very good doggos doing a great job! Also those two cops talking shit about working overtime lmao
$C: I heard the security guards refer to someone they were talking about as "the saltines"  0_o 
$C: Not yet, we're waiting on Ajit Pai. So basically yes.
$C: its 2-2 right now with Shit Pie still needing to vote
$C: Some people are only offered one fucking ISP in their area.. so what do they do?
$C: That is exactly the argument against NN. Let consumers vote with their dollars instead of creating federal benches and juries to mandate and regulate.

While I agree with it, you can't just 'let the consumers decide' when 50% of them  don't have a 2nd option for internet connectivity.That's exactly what broke Obamacare. Many of us ended up in states where there is only 1 plan to buy. period.
$C: Verizon was just the largest advocate in paying people off and now that it's done it's done. Isps all around are bowing in respect and thanking them for how good of a job they did at gaming the system and openly paying off pai.
$C: My nigga
$C: You do realize he’s been in office since 2012?
$C: Listen to yourself. You are a fucking leech. Pay for your own internet.

I just reported you to the FBI.
$C: What scares me is the number of self professed nerds that I speak to that haven't heard about it! 
$C: Thank you for that. I've read so many comments from people from other countries that say "Oh well, it's not my problem." 
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves. Violence was part of equal rights for Race and Gender. Violence stopped the Nazis and saved millions of lives. Violence created our Country and maintained it. It is a tool and in some situations it is the best tool for the job. This is one of those situations because all other avenues have been exhausted and the powers of the government themselves are being abused So there it is. There is the solution.     

I know you all won't listen and I know we will lose the internet because of it. I hope your ego and pretentious morality was worth us losing one the greatest wonders of the human world. My resentment is no longer just for the corrupt human garbage that pushed against Net Neutrality, but also now for all of you who allowed it to happen just because you didn't want to get dirty to clean up the filth.    

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: Hahahahahaha! I'm laughing at you! Seven more years to go!
$C: Aww lil guy is about to throw a tantrum
$C: Our political system has truly disenfranchised so many people by legalizing financial contributions from corporations (i.e. legalized bribery). Now politicians act as thought their primary constituents are companies rather that citizens.

As a result, many policy makes like Pai himself entirely ignore the overwhelming majority of Americans and vote in the interest of companies (see his funding from Verizon).
$C: I'm sure he does, but his speech is made to be full of rhetoric; to persuade by comparing things that have nothing to do with each other to an audience that doesn't know any better, taking advantage of people's ignorance for your own gain.
$C: He sucks major lemons but let's be better than them and not be racist. 
$C: For now. 
$C: Basically. Time for Revolution 2.0
$C: not really at all.
$C: Us Americans are never fucked. When people push too far, they’ll find out there is an assault rifle behind every blade of grass in his country. 
$C: Le duh. It's so funny watching white people's shock, FINALLY realizing that the USA is corrupt as fuck
$C: Perhaps they feel like they are conserving the principles of the Constitution of the United States. Most far left leaning idiot libtard, base their political stances on how they feel things should be from some perceived moral high ground learned from too many years of watching CNN and MSNBC.
$C: Guns do count. VERY much so. Lay the fuck off my guns democrats, and then I can agree with some of the moderate ones (hhowever there seem to be less and less moderates on both sides).

Im absolutely pissed about net neutrality being repealed.

If it really comes down to it (as in were utterly oppressed and have 0 voice), at least people can fight back with arms.
$C: and then what?

What will happen when there is a power vacuum in America?
$C: the racist exit is on the left.
$C: indeed
$C: > I haven't heard a single convincing argument 

AFAIK, there is **zero** benefit for the American public.  The only winners are corporations and the politicians who have been bought and paid for by these corporations.
$C: America is already a playground for greedy corporations.
$C: Losing Net Neutrality in the US affects you in Europe as well, don't be so naive to think you are free from this. 

For any site that is hosted in the US, its now at the whim of our ISPs, and at their will. If the site can't afford to, or refuses to, pay for decent bandwidth, then YOU, in Europe, will also be affected and will have a harder time seeing their content, if the American ISPs let it out of the country at all. 
$C: I wonder how they have cooked this propaganda that communism was laughable while communism was exactly opposite of this. Communism particularly had taken care that such money hungry corporates don't breed in society and change the way we live.
Of course, some politicians with bad intentions distorted the image of communism but still even then, a commoners life in Soviet Russian was far better than that of an average American. 

$C: I (fellow EU citizen) am afraid this will affect the EU: America First + no NN might mean 1st US companies and slow lane for all others...
Spotify etc will suffer if they do such things.. And I dont trust this yellow haired person in the White House.

$C: The EU is only ever a vote away from changing those laws.  You still have to watch out who you elect every time you vote to make sure people who would do that don't get power.
$C: As an American, i can tell you right now that republicans don't learn. And since they take up roughly half of our voting population, it won't matter.


$C: It’s worrying.  The telcos can afford to be patient and wait for voter apathy to set in. Six months from now when little has happened they’ll say “look you guys, you were totally overreacting”. Fervor dies down and the movement loses steam, and that’s when trouble really begins. 

It’s corporate short-sightedness vs. voter apathy at this point, so who knows?
$C: [removed]
$C: Thats because citizens do not elect a President - states do. What citizens do in a Presidential election is inform their states how they would like them to vote for President.
$C: Has to go through court first so not right away. 
$C: Currently under the Title 2 2015 regulations, ISPs can already censor as they see fit and they can already create a tiered payment system. 
$C: No, you will not. You never did. The entire idea of "fast lanes" was created by the big bandwidth users, Google, NetFlix, and PornHub to help push this bill. They were having to pay billions to transport providres, Tier 1 and Tier 2 ISP's b/c they use over half of all bandwidth available on the Internet. With Net Neutrality that they pushed, they didn't have to pay anything now, even though they were congesting the Internet. You never did have to pay extra, and you never will. You pay for your bandwidth, and thats what you get. 
$C: An injunction is very likely.
$C: I fully expect the rest of the world to have its internet fucked with at some point in future. As a British person I expect it will be soon... 
$C: They are back
$C: The vote is 2-2 with the last vote needed being by Ajit Pai. You can guess how that might go.

However, a bomb threat happened and the entire room had been evacuated.
$C: 4 voted.  Before the 5th could the room was evacuated on advice of security.  But the 5th was definitely about to vote to repeal
$C: Please let this happen... Only to pai
$C: > (even though theres proof they've done it in the past)

$C: America land of the ~~free~~ greed and home of the ~~brave~~ rich. 
$C: !@#$%^&*()...
$C: Comcast started throttling Netflix without warning in 2013/2014 and then demanded a huge sum of money from them to restore usable speeds. Shortly after this happened, the Net Neutrality rules that were just repealed were put into effect to prevent these kinds of abuses.
$C: Maybe not an answer you were looking for, but currently my ISP only throttles certain sites if you go over their "unlimited" internet cap.  So like when I go over the data cap youtube and netflix are almost unwatchable but a video from a news site will load immediately and play in HD.  I'm thinking this will become more common in the near future.
$C: No, the only thing that has ever happened was ISPs wanted to charge major internet companies for using huge amounts of their resources because the ISP has to pay for a bunch of hardware and servers to cope with all their traffic while the company doesn't have to pay for anything.

In response obongo launched net neutrality where ISPs have to do whatever the companies want or they get shot in the name of freedom. It was never anything to do with the end users.
$C: Not when they can control the flow of information on the internet.
$C: Lights out, guerilla radio!

$C: The scary part is that this shit could spread as we influence everyone's media. I hope something is changed.
$C: As a Canadian, our internet is leaps and bounds worse than the US.
$C: america was literally founded on "i don't wanna obey no rules, i wanna be able to do whatever the fuck i want in order to make more money". 
$C: It wouldn't be surprising if a whole bunch of people started picketing outside of the fcc's hq over this.
$C: Hopefully we can get it turned. This is is just crazy
$C: I am not a corporate overlord and I am glad that net neutrality was removed
$C: Dec 15 2017 the day the internet was the same as every day before it
$C: Pepperidge Farm also remembers
$C: Not sure if they ever considered this.
RIP internet
$C: R/the_donald is celebrating the overturning. The pinheads don’t even realize how much support they’re gonna lose. #MAGA = No Net Neutrality 
$C: Wait, FCC decision involves "Trump supporters"? Who are these "Trump supporters" anyway and why are they idiots?
$C: Trump supporter here. I revel in your suffering, I really do. Can you please give me more words about your emotional state? Your unhappiness is delightful to me.
$C: I am not a Trump supporter, but a conservative for Net Neutrality. This technically wasn't all Trump's fault because all he did was promote him to chairman of the FCC. Whereas Obama was the one who appointed him in the first place.
$C: Trump supporters didnt do this. You all did by having a broken democracy.
$C: reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
$C: You’re welcome you mad as fuck child lmao
$C: You are the moran.
$C: Because he's in charge of the organization that created the initial rules, he's not actually an elected official, and has full rights to repeal them. We need actual laws and maybe this is the first step towards that.. That is if the current congressmen/women want to remain in office for the next term.
$C: Because progressives love the regulatory state, and now we have un-elected bureaucrats passing laws without Congressional approval.
$C: Reddit has warped your view of reality. There are so many people outside of this site that couldn't give less of a fuck, and just as many that think the repeal is a good idea. Maybe take a break from circlejerking
$C: Because Americans are fat and complacent. They'll only care once their economy crashes, which will happen immediately after dems take power and naturally they'll get blamed for it. Just like they'll get blamed for the internet being destroyed right now. 
$C: They don't, not in the slightest and its frustrating when people spout the usual "call your rep!" We need to march to their offices and enter the building by force if necessary to make our voices heard. We need to follow them EVERYWHERE they go including their homes. That's how they got things done in the 60's. Now a days some neck beard thinks he's Jesus Christ because he's holding a cute sign in a designated protest zone for a couple of hours. Were all bark now and our elected officials know it. 
$C: As much as we dislike them, you can't hide everything you hate. They have a right to be on reddit. Plus, they are banned from /all anyway, so unless you go there, you don't have to worry about them. 

As far as net netruality is concerned, they seem to not understand it. They see Obama made the law so they want it gone. I actually made a pro net neutrality comment on there that got 500 upvotes by the donald users who agreed with me and didn't know why donald was against it. I was then banned by them and my comment was removed. 
$C: My opinions differ. Free speech is allowed for those idiots to say whatever they want. But some of their speech is so hate filled and toxic for society's health. I don't really know how to deal with it. Because if we ignore it, their beliefs could easily turn to violence and we didn't see it coming. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Geez isn't paying for SWTOR punishment enough for this person!?
$C: They have stricter laws than us, plus everyone there is required to own and shoot a gun. So if you dislike conservatives or republicans it’s the wrong place to go.
$C: If you're even half serious about this I'd like to join in.
$C: Wait can I come 
$C: Because the US is an Oligarchy.
$C: People vote on the issues? Like a democracy? 

What a crazy idea /s
$C: Agreed, but people can't go a day without netflix. 
$C: You're kidding yourself if you don't already know the outcome to the vote. Oreilly just spent 10 minutes shitting on NN, and the first few words that carr literally said were "I am proud to bring down net neutrality".
$C: The vote has not happened yet, so spez jumped the gun.
$C: There is a LOT Spez is hiding from you. Ask him about the money he makes selling your Reddit history to 3rd parties.
$C: He's jumping the gun a bit. The vote hasn't happened yet.
$C: you didn't say anything about a bomb, did you?
$C: Vote for pro-NN politicians.
$C: Can you elaborate on how saying that would cost a fee? Im trying to get caught up on this issue quickly, and statements like this are just confusing.
$C: How about we throw ajit and all these cunts of the cliff instead?
$C: It was a lot like it was under title II except at the very end they were starting to throttle netflix, try to control which apps had data caps and other such nonsense. Then they got sued, won because they were under title I and FCC couldn't enforce NN rules on them and so they were reclassified. 


$C: From what I have been able to gather 2015 was the year that the FCC reacted to / started to clamp down on Comcast (or some other ISP) throttling some content provider, by codifying it into regs that ISPs are common carriers (net neutrality). 

The powers of evil were just starting to flex their evil throttling muscles (or were just being caught doing it) for the first time in 2015. 

Someone with more knowledge on the subject should provide more info. 

$C: They behaved exactly like they do now. What everyone is concerned about is how they COULD behave if they CHOOSE to. Right now, ISPs can't charge Netflix and Blizzard extra to have their data carried, but without NN they potentially could. Everyone in favor of NN is assuming that instead of doing that, ISPs will just charge the consumers who use those services, instead.

$C: You've made up your mind and you want proof that your baseless opinion is correct? Come on.

ISPs have the potential to dick everyone over, but everyone already hates Comcast as it is (just as an example). If any ISP tries any shenanigans (which they haven't ever before) I guarantee you they'll lose customers and other ISPs will move into their territory to fill the void.
$C: What’s going on 
$C: Apparently there was a bomb threat 
$C: Then they cut to the white house press briefing room??? what is happening 
$C: WaPo stream is still live 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d_202l55LU
$C: I agree. So much slacktivism. I was upset to only see 45 or so people at my local protest.
$C: Yes because America is the entire world and everyone can go fuck themselves us paying more for internet is a tragedy and everyone must fight against it and suffer ???????????
$C: Vote delayed. Security threat. So possible bomb threat or death threat.
$C: They just evacuated due to a security concern. They have K9 units sniffing the room.
$C: Yeah pretty much.
$C: Well, the vote was 2-2 with ajit pai being the last one to vote.. and now all of the sudden they cut the broadcast for "security concerns" and empty the room.. hmm
$C: The vote was just interrupted by a security concern, but yes, today the FCC will vote 3-2 in favor of repealing the net neutrality provisions.
$C: We all know how Pai is going to vote.
$C: They also disabled the live chat on the video as they were evacuating people. 
$C: Bomb threats are stupid. If someone wanted to bomb the commissioners, why the fuck would they call in a warning?
$C: Ah, helpful. Thanks!

$C: based on this thread:

1. you will pay $20 fee to insult Pai
2. you will have to buy websites individually
3. the internet is over
4. you no longer have any rights
$C: Someone called in a bomb threat 
$C: Vote is 2 yes 2 no with Ajit fixing to vote yes for the bill. 
$C: we literally just watched a vote happen.
$C: That's already been done and it's on the front page: https://i.imgur.com/frkIGFD.png
$C: Because no one paid extra to be able to comment... IT HAS BEGUN.
$C: We won't have to pay for certain sites. Most likely certain websites will just be slowed down.
$C: Most likely awhile, so big companies can slowly creep it in and not look like total scumbags, especially considering most of them promise to never throttle or block anything
$C: Probably not long. It's likely known to ISPs who was going to vote which way. I'm sure they have had drafted up plans a while ago. It will probably start with a drip, then 6 months later a trickle, then 6 months later a stream, then 6 months later a full blown river. Expect these changes to happen around major holidays and holiday weekends. 
$C: Could be over the next few days.  Or a few years.  
$C: It was repealed.
$C: It went down 3-2 after a long speech by Pai full of lies
$C: It just got passed. No more NN
$C: No, they came back and the repeal went through

When an overwhelming majority of all people have voiced peaceful opposition against your policy, the next step is pretty clear.
$C: He didn't want to listen to the public. You can't silence a majority. He will need a security detail for a while because he has pissed off a lot of people. The problem is that he can have a lot of his personal detail to be hacked. That include his family. I don't think he realizes that he will have to look over his back for the rest of his life. He bought this upon himself. It not the right thing to do but he left a lot of people no choice. I am not condoning violence.
$C: I would never wish death or pain on someone. But I hope karma swings around and nails him. May you always take 3 tries to plug in a USB cable, may your favorite tv shows be cancelled, may you drop a gallon of milk on a carpeted floor and have to wait a week for a steam cleaner, may you never get more than 1 bar of service, may your beers be warm and your steaks overcooked, may your barber always ruin your hair and may you always step in dog shit when you go outside, Ajit Pai and cronies.

$C: What the fuck are you talking about? Foreign and domestic, bro. Our country is under attack. 
$C: > Nobody should be hurt or killed over things like this

I mean, one of the reasons (if not the only reason originally) you have a 2nd amendment is to stop a tyrannical government who ignores the will of the people no? You can't shout about KING GEORGE!!!ONEONE!!!MUHGUNS!! and then act surprised when someone actually suggests it. 
$C: Trying to hurt or kill the FCC is wrong. Doing anything to them would only make them a martyr. 
$C: Yes they should.
$C: I disagree. No such thing as a bloodless coup.
$C: Same, I'm against repealing NN, but reddit has been brainwashed to believe that people against NN literally deserve death. People here are either vastly overestimating what kind of effect this will have or are just straight up sociopaths.
$C: people should definitely be killed over issues like this. Who gives a flying fuck about three lives when their actions negatively effect the lives of MILLIONS of people. They deserve to die 
$C: I'm surprised this beta cuck's head hasn't already been chopped off on a livestream to serve as an example. Have fun spending your bribe money when you're dead.
$C: Not all heroes wear capes 
$C: I'd like to rip his heart out and shit in the cavity it creates, but I reported your comment.  Sorry, but AshitPie is only a symptom of the disease.  Doxxing him solves nothing. He's a meat puppet, and very easily replaced.
$C: doxxing?
$C: Oh don't worry, we did
$C: It won’t be the technology that slows them as much as the politics. I’d imagine we will start seeing “small” changes quite soon, but they’re going to want the furor to die down some before the enthusiastic butt fucking to really take off. 

It’s not over yet, laws can be changed, but if the telcos play their cards right and apathy sets in before they start really screwing people over it’s going to be a LOT harder to undo. 
$C: I would expect to see changes to price tiering, VPN access, and content speeds within a few weeks.
$C: The business models already exist in other countries. All they have to do is send notices to customers and it's on.
$C: Yep. It's always the women. I've been saying this on twitter for months and months. Women are the god damn revolution. We're trying to save y'all, god damnit. 
$C: You mean the two Democrats...
$C: nice pasta mate
$C: and this is the reason that T_D is so opposed to Net Neutrality. They can't in good faith support Trump and support Net Neutrality, so they chose Trump.
$C: > Donald Trump put Ajit Pai in the FCC.

That's simply not true. He was nominated for an FCC position by Obama, on McConnell's recommendation. Trump made him chairman. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Stop spreading fake information. Pai was in the FCC while Obama was in office several years ago...

$C: hahah, me love videogames too
$C: ISP Innovation is ISPs finding new ways to charge or screw you. 
$C: Because we have always had Cable/DSL internet right? Didn't start with shitty dial up and 28.8bit modems or less right?

Zero ISP innovation occurred right??

You fucking mook.
$C: ISP regulations aside, this comment displays massive ignorance.
$C: Funny how all the armed freedom fighters only talk about rebelling when them dirty dems wanna help people and not when their glorious leaders step all over them and talk about how they don't care about what you want. 
$C: Just look to Russia and you will see the future of the US

$C: *what an ea our govt is turning into
$C: Less
$C: Less. Start downloading all the porn that you can now.
$C: They weren't voted in, those people were appointed. 
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves. Violence was part of equal rights for Race and Gender. Violence stopped the Nazis and saved millions of lives. Violence created our Country and maintained it. It is a tool and in some situations it is the best tool for the job. This is one of those situations because all other avenues have been exhausted and the powers of the government themselves are being abused So there it is. There is the solution.     

I know you all won't listen and I know we will lose the internet because of it. I hope your ego and pretentious morality was worth us losing one the greatest wonders of the human world. My resentment is no longer just for the corrupt human garbage that pushed against Net Neutrality, but also now for all of you who allowed it to happen just because you didn't want to get dirty to clean up the filth.    

 Down votes to the left, losers.

$C: Move. Go to China. They love regulation there.... Dummy 
$C: I'm terribly confused that you fucking idiots don't understand Comcast can do whatever the hell he wants with his company. That includes censorship or whatever the fuck else. Comcat is not a government owned operation. Christ, you soyboy posters are the snowflakes you constantly whine about.
$C: I understand the concept of compromise, but in this case there is none to be made. There may not be a compromise!  This is crrupt offcials taking away people's freedom, destroying basic concepts of the internet , just for sakw of monopoly and personal gain

You cant  give even little finger to people like that.

Luckily i am not living in US. My country treats internet as basic need for a person. But because US is so big plaher and many of the vompanies afe from there, its doomed to affect us too in a way or another
$C: I read this as Joey Diaz
$C: When ever your kind "protest" you burn down cities and scream everything is unfair. Call it what it is..riot.
$C: Do not advocate violence.
$C: > Everyone has made this partisan, but it's not. It's about the cable lobby strategically donating HUGE sums of money to alternating candidate

Who all just happen to be Republican. 
$C: No it's partisan. Wake up.
$C: > Everyone has made this partisan, but it's not. 

So why are only the Republicans voting to gut Net Neutrality if it's not partisan?
$C: What's really sad is the Republicans very low cost of entry to selling your soul - 13k? https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/7xwknx/republican-members-of-congress-fcc-letter
Shit, I bet we could band together and "sponsor" politicians for better results. 
$C: Best breakdown I've seen yet. A+
$C: I'd tend to agree about the legislation part, but deregulating for it's own sake right now seems a bit misguided. Comcast and others are already acting nefariously when it comes to throttling their competition - what makes you think repealing Title II will increase competition and make them behave? Title II is the only thing that could have protected us until we got legislation enshrined, which will never come under this Congress or President.
$C: Are you really trying to blame Hillary for the corrupt Republicans voting unanimously to repeal net neutrality?

Hillary, like 95% of Democrats, is firmly FOR net neutrality. It is only conservatives that consistently adopt anti-internet rules.
$C: from above:

>"we can't get rid of [money in politics] until we get rid of [two party system] until we get rid of [first past the post voting] until we get a [constitutional amendment]"

So who the F___ am I supposed to vote for / what can be done besides not using the internet or some other (fairly impossible) similar sacrifice?

$C: I wish more people actually put some thought into the lager issue like you did. If I had gold, I would have gilded you.
$C: I'm mostly with you on this.  I just want to know why you think a legislative action rather than FTC  antitrust enforcement under current law is the way to go?  The FTC approach seems like it would be more adaptable to varieties and the evolution of abusive behavior over time, rather than trying to predict what the right and wrong business models of the future will be.  Also, the FTC is already set up as a tribunal experienced and equipped to handle abuses of market power, while new legislation would have to either point to an existing tribunal (either by explicitly expanding the FTC's current authority, sending it to the courts or the FCC that just rejected the role) or create a new agency altogether.
$C: That was an interesting post. Sorry you got the controversy cross. 
$C: I never thought I’d see the day where a Star Wars game and the fight for the most powerful tool in the world would somehow fit together.
$C: Oh, did they keep net neutrality?
$C: You know what...after today I'm abandoning the Republican Party that's for sure.

Fuck em
$C: I'm an independent and I agree with this. The Republican party is compromised at the congressional level. It will only be fixed if they are unilaterally taken down.

But once the blue wave comes, if it comes, we still have to make sure the ones in control are ones we like and not simply ones who are on our "team."
$C: Seriously this. And fuck reddit for harboring t_d and allowing people like Pai to be elevated and put on a stage. The admins here have some blame in this. 
$C: As a young adult I didn't have any reason to identify as either party.... Whelp, now I do
$C: Voted for Obama twice. Voted for Bernie in the primaries. Voted for Trump in the general. I'll never vote democrat again in my life and I'm still registered as one.
$C: Its too soon to vote democrat. Historically the office of president has only passed from democrat to democrat twice and in both cases it was the death of the president that allowed this to happen.  
  
President Trump has to clean up the mess Barry made. Maybe in 20 years or so the Dems will get another chance. 
$C: Implying the dems aren't also corrupt.
$C: Stop pushing gun control and I'll vote blue til the end of my days

$C: Why would anyone want to vote demoncrat?  Your corrupt party is going extinct.  I will celebrate by dancing in the ashes.
$C: This is basically the level of discourse that takes place on this site summed up
$C: There are OTHER issues that people might have a differing opinion on. The internet is not the only issue that the government deals with!
$C: Or neither. 
$C: Under Trump we got a tax cut, regulations were cut, and we got someone appointed to the Supreme Court that actually cares what the Constitution says.

We would have gotten the opposite under Hillary. So thanks, but no thanks.
$C: Never in my life 
$C: why they are both sold to the highest bidder there are no sides anymore.
$C: Why would I vote for one party of political whores over another party of political whores?

Vote third party. 
$C: Sure, just outlaw abortion completely.  Otherwise fuck you I'm on the Trump Train.
$C: reddit is not the internet
$C: Sounds like you've had a little too much wrongthink.
$C: # They let leftards create throwaway accounts to post fake comments in T_D threads calling for brigading. Then they screenshot and use them as fake news in the other subs to paint T_D subscribers as the bad ones.

# Meanwhile T_D is been heavily brigaded by these leftards for days. Even fuck u/spez and his minions a turning a blind eye on this. Reddit rules apply only when it hurts their feefees.

# NET NEUTRALITY MY ASS.
$C: banning Nazi is free speech.
$C: Turns out bitching and brigading on reddit doesn't do shit in the real world. What a surprise
$C: uhm, they didn't just eliminate elections.
$C: No way they postpone this months. 
$C: Too late, Pai is back on the mic
$C: Paypal work for you?
$C: It delayed it by minutes. Pai is about to vote now
$C: Nope. Most local municipalities have cut deals with isps to prevent other companies laying line on their land. That is why most people only have one or two choices for their isp.
$C: Likely not, you'd either get slammed down by the companies themselves, or get hit with no competition policies that may/may not have been put in place in certain areas.
$C: Sure. If you were the CEO and had total control over your company's policies you could choose to adhere to the ex laws of net neutrality. You just wouldn't be legally obliged to. You would get a whole bunch of redditors as customers but I can't confidently say how many grandparents you would get.
$C: Capt Obvious over here everyone :-D
$C: I mean, yeah
$C: I think you meant "cunt"...
$C: Obama appointed Pai to the FCC, he was only made chairman under trump....
$C: And we are happy it's happening. Your echo chambers won't have full control of the internet any longer. Too bad, so sad! 😂😂🇺🇸

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: The internet is free TO YOU

For anyone with conservative opinion, the internet is completely locked down and they get banned and removed from the conversation
$C: In their mom's basement 
$C: we are
$C: No this is on Obama, he’s the one that appointed pai to the fcc. Trump just bought the premium package and made him chairman
$C: It's always the republicans fault, LOL. For the record, I was against repealing NN as were many other republicans.
$C: lol 
$C: It's brought to you by the same people who pushed "the stock market will tank under Trump," "insurance costs will balloon to 300% of present day," "under the Republican tax plan, you will have lower take home in 2027 because we assume inflation will outpace wage growth and also that's when the individual rebate expires."  
  
Fearmongering worst case scenarios dreamed up by one person who probably also thinks babies continue their rate of growth from conception forever but never questions where the 600 foot babies are.
$C: I’m assuming your company has a lot of competition. ISPs do not.
$C: Well, it happened to Cable TV. Then we resorted to using the internet and they finally caught up. You'll have less customers but the ones that stay will make up for those lost. As time passes it will become the norm.

Please save us Google Fiber.
$C: Your company doesn’t employ those business practices because they have competition. If they piss off their customer base, they will lose customers. The problem is that the ISPs have tried their best to prevent any kind of competition from forming and essentially have full control of the internet. Most people don’t have a choice as to who they get their internet from. Comcast can do whatever they want and if I want to have internet, I just have to deal with whatever they do. 
$C: > Am I the only person who feels like the whole "Social Network Package, +$10/mo" type messaging we've been seeing is kind of dishonest?

It isn't, other countries without these protections have exactly that.
$C: That package image has been going around since digg. It's over 10 years old. 
$C: The problem here is that most Americans only have access to one cable provider meaning your price example doesn't work. The second issue here is that ISPs can now censor websites/content/innovations they do not like. An ability that Verizon has already taken advantage of multiple times when possible.
$C: Has your company carved out long standing exclusivity agreements in your territory blocking other types of businesses like the one you work for? If so, great comparison, if not, not really applicable.
$C: They don't have _less_ competition in the US, they have no competition.

They have literally established monopolies in a majority of your country where people have no choice but to pick one provider if they want internet at all.

It's not dishonest considering when it _was_ illegal for them to throttle traffic and block certain services they _still did_, and on multiple occations.

Your company couldn't do that simply because you would lose customers, but what if your customers had no one else to turn too - Would you still lose customers if you were providing something that people needed to continue paying their bills, searching for jobs, and getting a majority of their entertainment through?

Your company might not need, but equating a small business with one that has a literal monopoly on a certain part of the market is just dishonest.

>During the oral argument in the case, the federal judges questioned whether Verizon actually intended to create a "two-sided market"—charging both its subscribers and the companies who wanted to reach them.

>**"I'm authorized to state by my client today that but for these rules, we would be exploring those types of arrangements,"** Verizon's attorney, Helgi Walker, said at the time.

TL;DR: Verizon was actively coming up with plans to do such a thing before the FCC stopped them.
$C: In a perfect world with healthy competition that would be the case. In the current market with a majority of the people having only 1 internet provider there is nothing stopping them from screwing us because they know that we need the internet for everything now and we don't have other options.
$C: And video games weren't really utilizing pay to win, or loot boxes much back then either...until they realized idiots will still throw money at it.

Same thing will happen with ISPs
$C: yeah lets keep writing them letters and praying that they'll listen when they're making millions off bribes. that'll do it. It worked so well today.

$C: On this issue?

Sure.

on everything? That's dangerous as fuck
$C: The 'South Park' effect is real. Too many Americans fell for the trope 'both sides are the same'. 3 Conservative Republicans voted to end net neutrality, 2 Liberal Democrats voted to keep it.

Vote in 2018. The higher the voter turnout, the more republicans lose elections.
$C: Obama appointed Pai to the FCC. Trump made him chairman. Using bold in your mini rants doesn’t make you look smarter.

Be glad that the European Union firmly believes in NN.
$C: Vote passed, not in our favor
$C: No, they're already established businesses. Removing NN removes the obligation to allow competition, further cementing their relevance.
$C: We're fucked.
$C: I believe part of this repeal was negating state laws that contradicted it unless I'm conflating it with something else.
$C: Congress has nothing to do with it. The FCC is appointed by the President.

$C: The option to pay more for sites with monetary entanglements with their competitors. Also the option to get slower speeds (not really an option since there's no opt-out) to sites and services that for one reason or another they dislike. 
$C: From Wikipedia article, introductory section: 

"A widely cited example of a violation of net neutrality principles was the Internet service provider Comcast's secret slowing ("throttling") of uploads from peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P) applications by using forged packets.[7] Comcast did not stop blocking these protocols, like BitTorrent, until the FCC ordered them to stop"
$C: It basically means the ISPs had to take a hands-off approach to Internet traffic. They couldn't throttle or increase speeds to sites depending on which ones they were partnered with and had monetary interest in. Now they can. 
$C: They have to keep reiterating the “organic” part because everyone knows it’s false but are hoping if they use it enough it will crowd out the people calling BS when all this data ultimately gets indexed and added to the official record.

Sort of like Ajit Pai’s overuse of “heavy handed” or Obama’s overuse of “unprecedented”.

There was nothing anyone could do after the election, and until we vote out the R majorities, there's nothing to be done on the federal level now except sue the FCC and hope the SCOTUS doesn't fuck us next year, which is a good joke because they probably will too.

$C: ...but you are getting change. We're making America great again, and there's nothing you can do to stop us.;
$C: Glad to know not everyone on Reddit is a circlejerking, sheep and can think forthemself
$C: Do you remember these?

Just because you're ignorant, or a blind partisan for Trump and the conservatives who are hell-bent on ruining the internet, doesn't mean damage wasn't being done.
$C: but drumpf is ruining the internet by taking out something thats been in for a whole year. How can he get away with this
$C: Honest question. I'm not against protesting, am just cynical, so do you think protesting will accomplish anything of significance? If so, what are the chances?
$C: Lol
$C: Interesting fact you may not know:

The majority of women did not support the women's suffrage movement, research it. The right to vote was bought and paid for by your obligation to serve in the military if needed, aka the draft. The majority of women didn't want that obligation. That still hasn't changed. 

In America women are the only group that got the right to vote without purchasing that right through an obligation to serve. 
$C: Just keep virtue signaling as hard as you can on reddit, and make sure you act as hysterically upset as possible.
$C: You do realise you are using internet rright?
$C: Yup. My friends and I were talking about this Net Neutrality news earlier. They try to be "neutral" when it comes to politics. Which is fine but while they were only talking facts, they wouldn't bring up Trump. I had to be the one to do it. It's so weird how much passes people give to Trump.
$C: Yea we good up here, but it's still not a good thing since a lot of shit we care about will be affected by this. 
$C: What are ya going to do? Imaginery internet point him into submission?
$C: Pray 5 times a day 
$C: Why do you need to help?  This is a good thing.
$C: Cry some more American fag
$C: is there a link to this and the rest of the vote?

$C: WTF I love censorship now!
$C: They support destroying Net Neutrality. Literally, I get they have opposing views but how are they always on the controversial side of every single subject. Can someone tell me ONE legitimate reason they think this is the case?
$C: It’s legitimately weird that people like you have an adult hatred towards a section of website so badly you actually want it banned. literally who the fuck cares. Are they ruining *le internet* for you?   
$C: [deleted]
$C: And organising terror attacks and murders. Owners of reddit should be tried for sedition. 
$C: How are they promoting brigading? I use r/The_Donald quite a bit, but I saw this on my frontpage like everyone else... Should I not be allowed to participate in any sub besides r/The_Donald? That's absurd.
$C: Yes people that don't agree with you laughing at you having a mental breakdown is now brigading...Nobody has to brigade when it's well known you people throw a tantrum every time you don't get your way, like clock work.
$C: Liberals brigade too. Tax cut win in senate was all that.
$C: You mean censor opposite views?
$C: But that wouldn’t be supporting Net Neutrality then.
$C: sauce?
$C: That attitude is why I say fuck you and fuck your net neutrality.
$C: That's how humans solve problems. We tried emails and it didn't work.
$C: Why ban an ™™™™™organic takeover™™™™™ of reddit?
$C: You're kidding yourself if you don't already know the outcome to the vote. Oreilly just spent 10 minutes shitting on NN, and the first few words that carr literally said were "I am proud to bring down net neutrality".
$C: Pai is a definite, and now, O'Reilly and Carr stated that they support the decision.
$C: [deleted]
$C: [removed]
$C: The fact that google/youtube, facebook, twitter, reddit and so many others who openly censor internet content were against the repeal of Title 2 is all you need to know.
$C: [deleted]
$C: sounds like your brother had shit parents.
$C: The only problem with this train of thought is if things get really bad your brother looses any path to enlighten himself.
$C: They are. To them, this is the best news ever.
$C: Oh shut the fuck up, ghazi scum. Don't you have big boobs in video games you could be complaining about? 
$C: IT WAS HER TURN SHE DESERVED TO WIN IT WAS HER TURN THE DYNASTY SHOULD HAVE CONTINUED WHY DID YOU DO THIS DRUMPF WHY DID YOU ROB THE FUHRER OF HER REICH
$C: damn
$C: Fuck pai. I don't care if he gets skinned alive, he has fucked over hundreds of millions of people just so he can get more money. He has taken away the most useful invention ever created because he wants more money. I hope he gets tortured to death
$C: That's hilarious. Him complaining about AT&T blocking skype is so hypocritical when he was the first social media CEO to engage in mass censorship.
$C: Got a link?
$C: aww /u/spez a qt :3
$C: Thank God we dodged that bullet.

7 more years!
$C: Holy shit, imagine that, a comment based on 100% fact, nobody will engage in debate on it here though, instead they downvote it to oblivion.

Feels > Reals

None of these people understand what Title II, they were just told it was net neutrality, and they are good subservient serfs.
$C: Every downvote you receive is a salty reddit drone too weak to participate in an intellectual debate. No counter arguments, only impotent rage. GG
$C: Hello! You've subscribed to Net Neutrality Facts~! Please indicate that you have any idea what you're talking about to unsubscribe!

Did you know that until 2014, the FCC vigorously protected Net Neutrality and consumers from [constantly overreaching ISPs](https://www.freepress.net/blog/2017/04/25/net-neutrality-violations-brief-history), and was able to do so without the need of its 2015 regulation? It's true~!

In January of 2014, Verizon successfully won a court ruling stating that the FCC could no longer enforce their will upon ISPs without re-classifying the ISPs under Title II. These are the very same regulations ISPs were classified under from 1996 until 2005!

In fact, Title II is the law that allows for local loop unbundling! It's right there in [Section 251 (3)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/251)! 

However, when reclassifying ISPs in 2015, Tom Wheeler used forebearance to avoid applying this section to the ISPs, because he was trying to give them a lighter version of Title II to lessen their regulatory burden and find a compromise! Whoopsie daisy~!

In a surprising turn of events, it seems that redditors who are unaware of these facts are almost exclusively frequent posters to /r/the_donald ! What a wild coincidence~!
           
If you would like to hear more about Net Neutrality, please type literally anything into your chat box! Have a great and pleasant day~!
$C: > the ideas behind net neutrality

$C: Can someone create a meme of him and his big ass Reese (?) coffee mug.
Anyone else notice that?
$C: I think it is already beginning. The hearing has been evacuated due to an unspecified threat.

I have a feeling a lot of threats are going to hit not only the FCC but a lot of peripheral locations (workplaces, etc) in light of these actions.
$C: You want to die because the rules of the internet have changed? I hate this situation as much as the next guy, but you need help man.
$C: This country has always been a fucked up place. 
$C: gg 
$C: $$$
$C: Yes
$C: Yes they just did
$C: Yes.
$C: yep.
$C: Same reason we want net netruality. Freedom of the internet.
$C: Not almost, they are.
$C: If you're genuinely curious: https://i.imgur.com/WuwtV6n.png
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves. Violence was part of equal rights for Race and Gender. Violence stopped the Nazis and saved millions of lives. Violence created our Country and maintained it. It is a tool and in some situations it is the best tool for the job. This is one of those situations because all other avenues have been exhausted and the powers of the government themselves are being abused So there it is. There is the solution.     

I know you all won't listen and I know we will lose the internet because of it. I hope your ego and pretentious morality was worth us losing one the greatest wonders of the human world. My resentment is no longer just for the corrupt human garbage that pushed against Net Neutrality, but also now for all of you who allowed it to happen just because you didn't want to get dirty to clean up the filth.    

 Down votes to the left, losers.

Just because you're ignorant, or a blind partisan for Trump and the conservatives who are hell-bent on ruining the internet, doesn't mean damage wasn't being done.
$C: Right? Especially considering some of the state-subs that showed up were entirely niche and barely populated
$C: Ayyyy
$C: THat was very neutral amirite :thinking:
$C: popcorn tastes good
$C: It was honestly choosing the worst of 2 evils. Too bad the devil won. 
$C: then we would have a slimy corrupt witch as a president and the whole country would be fucked 20x harder
$C: "Not yet."
$C: Do not advocate violence.
$C: Syllables are a bit off
$C: Oh snap it's the next day now and the internet is still here.  What happened?

$C: t_D isn't alt right
$C: They voted months ago, this process has a foregone conclusion. The real fight starts now.
$C: Fuck censorship, they may be a bunch of blind fucks but they still have the right to be heard. Censoring things you don't like is bullshit and fuck the very notion of it 
$C: In the spirit of neutrality, you suggest banning people with different viewpoints. 10/10
$C: FREE INTERNET NO CENSORSHIP oh btw can you ban T_D for having different Political views ty 
$C: This. I have no problem with it being done but call it what it was: orchestrated.

$C: That's not what Net Neutrality means. 
$C: > Does that neutrality also include editing others inputs when they are at odds with his own?

No... Completely different subject.
$C: > Does that neutrality also include editing others inputs when they are at odds with his own?

Why would it? Do you actually know what NN is?

No

$C: So what you're 100% saying is that you want comcast to control every single page you visit? Got it. 
$C: This has nothing to do with it

$C: [deleted]
$C: Good news. Your parents can opt out of the reddit package from Comcast now. Hooray! They* can save a couple of dollars.
$C: I agree, but I live in the south. Don't generalize people, that's how you get people against you.
$C: I'm sorry but Trump won because of Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio. Hardly the south. You aren't paying attention are you?
$C: Trump is from New York, and he won most states in the country, not just the south.
$C: What’s wrong with the south?
$C: Ugh, can't believe these RACIST BIGOT INBREDs into the white house. I am an upper-middle class bourgeois burden on society that substitutes class theory with idpol.

$C: I think /u/spez hit submit on his premade post a bit early lol
$C: Wait, you mean they haven't voted yet!? But I rhought they said that the Net Neutrality was repealed!

$C: Is this a poem? 
$C: Every time a net neutrality repeal is shot down they make a new bill... but if they get evacuated every time they try to vote to repeal...
$C: Wtf I had to poop! What happened?! 
$C: Hopefully big enough to keep a decent part of America out of it
$C: No, but we know how Pai is going to vote. 
$C: its essentially done
$C: No. Before Pai could cast his vote and finish his monologue the room was "evacuated" in a non-emergency fashion.

"Security has advised us to take a quick recess" followed by someone directing people to leave their belongings and file out of the room.
$C: Agreed
$C: People who were listening to the commissioners speak they could conclude what they were going to vote for, either vote I or dissent. An hour ago, it was 3 of 4 conluded and of those I believe it was either 2 for and 1 against or 2 against and 1 for. In that time when the 4th spoke on the opening line it was concluded just as the previous comments had been deduced that the 4th commissioner was either for or against the repeal. Ajit Pai was last to comment and everyone predicted his stance before he even spoke.
$C: This vote was a formality, their minds were already made up 
$C: Because ShareBlue is mobilized just that quickly.
$C: Yes
$C: Vote.
$C: How many ISPs are in your area?
$C: "Tolerant" left 
$C: Do not advocate violence.
$C: Not shut down, throttled to nonexistence.
$C: No they didn’t. We voted representatives who vote on our behalf. Maybe you aren’t happy with your representatives but they won their election and are now doing their job. That’s why voting is so crucial.
$C: Get to it then
$C: One word.....MONEY.
$C: I honestly believe that if the Obama administration had a ghost of a chance of passing legislation for net neutrality, it would have done so, but the Republicans were never going to allow it. Vote them out.

$C: It's an executive branch regulation put into place by the Obama administration. It was never a legislative one where more more people could have had a voice.
$C: Did you use the internet before 2015?

Like that. 

$C: There's two thinks to keep in mind. 

1) Net Neutrality

and 

2) Net Neutrality laws. 

Net Neutrality isn't a law, it's a concept. This concept as a law existed only from 2015-2017. This concept though has been adhered to by ISPs since about 1996 without law. 

The problem is, roughly around 2007 ISPs tried to do away with adhering to that concept, because money. Then the FCC stepped in, and said they can't do that. They sued the FCC in court. They won. Same thing happened again but this time it was cellular providers doing the same lawsuit but for a different spectrum, again, the FCC lost. 

The FCC was told they have no authorization since there is no law. So they made it law in 2015.  Today, that law has been repealed by a 3-2 vote. 

Prior to 1996 (I want to say I remember this happening around 1994), I remember being charged literally by the minute to be online. If you're online for 10 minutes, you're charged 10 minutes worth of a bill. 100 hours, 100 hour bill. 

So to answer your question of what will the internet start to look like, we don't know but we have an educated guess. 

It will likely be sectioned off into tiers like cable is. We've never had a long period of time where the internet is used without net neutrality, regardless of if that was by law, or by convenience. 

The internet will never stop evolving, and never stop growing. The problem now is, it's being pushed into a direction where it grows as a platform of profit, rather then a platform of open exchange. Business can still exist with an open exchange internet, but an internet built around profit is one where profit is the only objective. 
$C: Hahahahahahaha
$C: Exactly this. These people swear the repeal of NN is the end of the world. I can’t wait to see how dumb they feel when they realize they’ve been bamboozled and propagandized, once they see that these “internet packages” will still be non-existent. (Like they were prior to 2015 when the law was passed.) 

It’s frustrating that so many people believe something just because Reddit said it. Like zombies. 
$C: Back to magazines and dvds!
$C: That would mean redditors would have to go outside, are you insane?
$C: OH NO THE INTERNET IS GONNA BE HOW IT WAS BEFORE 2015 WHATEVER WILL WE DO LETS GO RIOT IT WAS SO BAD BACK THEN

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
$C: Everything about this comment is stupid. Delete.
$C: typical liberal ideals on unfiltered display..
$C: leftoids can't inflict violence cuz they're encased in bubblewrap
$C: Allahu akbar
$C: \*truck noises*
$C: He actually tried to call it activism hahaha

Posting on Reddit and changing one tiny logo is NOT activism. It's called slacktivism.
$C: only idiots are surprised 
$C: No one wants racist propaganda upvoted by russian bots on the front page.

Enjoy your bundled internet package too.

$C: You mad bro?
$C: Lol exactly 
$C: that is widely different thing.

Internet providers can now in the US kill any company dependent of internet if they dont pay them enough money. 

I am "extreme right wing* conservative in my country,  but there is just 0 reasons to defend this crap. The corruption and the greed is just plain to see
$C: That feel when T_D had an actual "organic takeover" of the front page and that ended up in algorithms being changed so that specifically wasn't possible. 
$C: sorry but i dont agree with you, let the downvotes rain on me
$C: salty trumpet
$C: >implying takeovers of the front page are not typically organic
$C: Click on the rising threads tab. That's how so many small subs were able to make noise. Boom conspiracy busted. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: no vote yet, just a guy saying our comments didn't matter and everything we have claimed would happen is a lie.
$C: nothing yet, the vote hasn't officially concluded, 1 yay and 1 nay so far, sounds like a 2nd Yay is coming right now, and Pai will also vote Yay, with the other Dem voting Nay, thus we can conclude that the final vote will be 3 yay 2 nay, thus passing the repeal of NN

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: I didn't think I would read a more ignorant comment today, but here we are.
$C: We should first focus on winning back seats in Congress. Currently the republicans control everything. So their will is law until that changes
$C: You being oblivious isn't an excuse for this to pass.
$C: Wtf are you talking about there were thousands if not millions of emails and phone calls to the fcc and senators we can’t do much else because in the end it’s their corrupt decision it’s not our fault if they completely disregard our opinions even though they are supposed to represent the people
$C: that was unexpectedly poetic. 
$C: Yeah, already sick of it 
$C: At least learn to spell if you want to be involved in an adult conversation.
$C: Do you think websites and ISPs are the same thing? 
$C: Net neutrality has a specific meaning. Access to the internet must be neutral, specific sites don't have to be. Or do all porn sites have to cater to my love for dick, too?
$C: That has anything to do with net neutrality. 
$C: gtfo, your sub is annoying AF
$C: make your own fucking website if reddit is such a shit website. Jeez you people always like to bitch the most, yet you stay....
$C: Ehh I got banned from the_donald for disagreeing with someone. Your side on this is ignorant as fuck.
$C: When you base your entire vote off NN....

You’re gonna have a bad time.
$C: /r/cringe
$C: >when the soy hits you hard as fuck
$C: I could've sworn I wasn't on Tumblr...
$C: Hahaha Democrats. What will those sore losers try next!? You won't believe #5!!!

1. Lose
2. Lose
3. Keep losing
4. Lose more
5. Accuse political opponents of sexual impropriety without solid evidence
6. Temporary win
7. Right back to losing

$C: lol it's fine. as soon as we replace ~~all the founding stock and builders of the nation~~ the evil racist nazi inbred white people with real culture like hispanics and black egyptian kingkangz, we can finally bring about that perfect rick and morty plastic elon musk ubi social democrat/neoliberal utopia that we all obviously want and consent to!
$C: Democrats have a huge money in politics problem too. They're also bought and sold, even if they're not as extreme in their subservience to the oligarchy.
$C: hmmm, how about no lol
$C: Nah, fuck government overreach.  Reddit as a whole is giant statist hive-mind.  You're welcome for the vote.
$C: Reminds me of how TD treat anyone who mentions Lane Davis, the popular TDer who murdered his own father.
$C: That's not what net neutrality means.
$C: That's not what Net Neutrality means. 
$C: you went full retard, never go full retard.
$C: Don’t be sorry. The trump kiddos are just a salty bunch. 
$C: Most people predicted it was going to end up 3-2. 
$C: Who thought that?  Until election time there isn’t much people can do besides be upset on the Internet.
$C: > But it’s Hilarious how Reddit thinks being angry on the internet over something makes a difference in the real world.

It's called Virtue Bitching
$C: I was telling my friends this morning that the focus was all over the place. Some people said we needed to contact senators and house members. Others were focused on the fake FCC comments.


We should have focused on getting one big and powerful name behind us to lobby against any changes. That name should have been Netflix. They currently don't care about net neutrality. But you know what would have made them care? Half a million people cancelling subscriptions. And how easy would it be to tell family members about net neutrality if you use Netflix as an example of what could happen.
$C: So with you man. The 20 year olds on this site seem to be ignoring the fact that nobody over 50 gives a flying fuck about net neutrality. 
$C: I and others werent just angsty cucks moaning about this on reddit. We contacted representitives, visited offices, wrote letters, and attended protests. You can fuck right off. You self-righteous, lazy, cunt.
$C: The internet is our way of life.....get real.

People won't boycott something so essential.
$C: I'd love to see you do it 
$C: There's no "new regulations" you dumb fucking moron.
$C: NET NEUTRALITY FREEDOM FOR THE INTERNET OH WE LOST LETS COMPLETELY ABANDON THE INTERNET!!!!!!!! ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? bet this guy will pay instantly when the bill comes and won't do shit just trying to get some quick karma 
$C: How will you cucks virtue signal to your facebook friends about how tolerant and progressive you are if you don't have the internet though? You think likes just grow on trees? There are nazis that need defeating and orphan refugees that need saving with your witty comments and likes, you just going to abandon them? Give up the resistance and go home?
$C: WAITTT, like...voting with your wallet? Interesting. 
$C: Nothing will happen, Chicken Little.

The sky is not falling.  You have been brainwashed.
$C: I'd be really curious to see what would happen if all the pro NN Americans just stopped paying their internet bills. Seriously, if 25 million people stopped paying their $40+ bill for one month that's over a billion $ lost. Even if just temporary it'd be beautiful to kick Telecom in the nuts like that. I'm sure with our contracts they'd have recourse to recover the money lost, but I bet it'd still hurt them.
$C: Yeah man this sounds perfect. Let's all get right on it.
$C: k, bye

$C: Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out. 
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves. Violence was part of equal rights for Race and Gender. Violence stopped the Nazis and saved millions of lives. Violence created our Country and maintained it. It is a tool and in some situations it is the best tool for the job. This is one of those situations because all other avenues have been exhausted and the powers of the government themselves are being abused So there it is. There is the solution.     

I know you all won't listen and I know we will lose the internet because of it. I hope your ego and pretentious morality was worth us losing one the greatest wonders of the human world. My resentment is no longer just for the corrupt human garbage that pushed against Net Neutrality, but also now for all of you who allowed it to happen just because you didn't want to get dirty to clean up the filth.

$C: It's a form of oppression. Let the plebs know they mean Jack shit by spitting in their face. 
$C: It says that certain protections have to be in place for carriers (in context radio and phone). The main distinction here is whether isps are a means to the data or if they provide the data. Phone companies dont provide data they provide means to data so they are regulated under title 2. The problem is it is so obviously they provide access to data not the data itself, that this vote is just an insulting vomit into the face of the citizenship.

$C: [deleted]
$C: how will twitter be gone ????? even in your bubble if this somehow kills twitter the rest of the world exists you know
$C: Because some people don't have any other options. 
$C: All Data is treated equal.


Repealing means that companies pay to have their services or data accessible to the consumer. 
$C: Regulation making all ISPs treat all traffic the same regardless of what said traffic is
$C: If NN doesn't exist internet companies can package internet websites like cable plans, make you pay extra per month based on the sites you want to access.  They can bundle facebook into a social media package for an extra 5$ a month or something.  They can block your access to any sites they want and throttle speeds to any sites they want.  Comcast has a stake in Hulu and without NN they can make Netflix so slow you would only have the option to watch streaming video on Hulu.  Other ISPs could throttle both and make their own version of a streaming service and force you to use that.
$C: Regulations that prevent Internet Service Providers like Comcast from being able to basically do whatever they want. Things like slapping extra prices onto everything, making you pay to access certain websites, making websites of their competitors slower when using their service, etc. Bad for pretty much everyone who isn't the CEO of an ISP. 
$C: The internet as it is now is like buying a whole pizza.

Post NN-repeal, it could be like buying pizza by the slice.
$C: It stops internet providers from charging you more for certain content. Imagine if you could only use the right lane on the highway, and if you want to use the left lane, which is much faster and doesn't have traffic, you have to pay an additional $20 a month. 
$C: 3 security guards and a dog walking around. The 4 of them are probably more competent voters than those who got evacuated.
$C: Recess due to bomb threat.
$C: not officially, but the members more or less told us how they're going to vote during the hearing.
$C: I don't think the final vote was cast. Someone called in a bomb threat and the evacuated. 
$C: 3-2 NN = dead assuming Pai stays for the repeal.
$C: At&t is a equal offender of net neutrality and their take over of time Warner will not make them any more friendlier towards it.
$C: I not only carried this sign - I called out to customers walking in our out of the store that they should switch to T-mobile.

$C: For now, spread awareness. Tell your family and friends. Our current administration might be more sensible on this issue, but the big ISPs like Bell and Shaw want nothing less than an end to net neutrality for good, and there are plenty of politicians out there willing to help them.
$C: Exactly, how is this not a freedom of speech issue?
$C: [deleted]
$C: Actually I've been combing through 4chan seeing if they did it - but it seems like they haven't?  Also a bomb threat is never a good thing. There are innocent people there, and bomb dogs. :(
$C: They would probably feel the pain for a day or two, but they'd be comforted with the face that we'd have to sign back up because everything depends on their services. They'd probably retaliate by increasing prices to sign back up. 
$C: It's forbidden under EU law but hey it ain't impossible... EU has a tendency to follow USA
$C: Big part of the problem is that the general public aren't that aware of it. Reddit and other websites create this illusion like the whole of American society is up in arms against it, but in reality .... most people who I see at work and such don't even know what it is, and I think that goes for most people.
$C: Yup.  Vote passed.  Net neutrality is dead.
$C: **Minitel**

The Minitel was a Videotex online service accessible through telephone lines, and is considered one of the world's most successful pre-World Wide Web online services.

The service was rolled out experimentally in 1978 in Brittany and throughout France in 1982 by the PTT (Postes, Télégraphes et Téléphones; divided since 1991 between France Télécom and La Poste). From its early days, users could make online purchases, make train reservations, check stock prices, search the telephone directory, have a mail box, and chat in a similar way to that now made possible by the Internet.

In February 2009, France Telecom indicated the Minitel network still had 10 million monthly connections.

$C: it just did
$C: It has passed 3 - 2
$C: It just passed, we lost.
$C: The vote passed, some time ago
$C: It has passed. 
$C: yes very soon
$C: ...you pay for internet already?
$C: It won't be immediate. It will take some time. 
$C: Why use the n word racist?
$C: They can do anything now
$C: Yes, but the date by which they ought to respond is in about a week. Could pretty much be any time this month.
$C: Like an internet fork
$C: Spez 
$C: Ok, and if you tell Netflix they'll shrug and say 'take it to ISP' and your ISP will shrug and just say 'some people suck' and proceed to ignore you.
$C: A rule were in place that made it so your internet provider (Verizon, Comcast, Time Warner, etc) couldn't inhibit your internet usage. The vote today was to repeal that rule so now they can inhibit your internet use (*as long as they tell you*)
$C: People are about to discover the Y2K scare was just that, a scare. And nothing will change.
$C: He won
$C: He's won for now. 
$C: We have always had net neutrality. Do you mean what was it like before this was an issue? 

$C: From what I remember, exactly the same. 
$C: It was just fine. There was no censorship, oligarchy, or broadband restrictions that everyone is whining about right now. Don't buy into the massive sky-is-falling hysteria that everyone here is whining about. The internet will be no different than it was in 2014.
$C: Doomfist here.

$C: On it..
$C: Hot 
$C: Pretty sure they take money from your paycheck so that you can't refuse to give them money.
$C: These are phone and TV plans. Am I missing something?
$C: Naw. The people who doesn't think this "stuff" applies to them need to be effected first. Then people will actually care enough to do something.
$C: It happened. It was 3-2 in favor of repeal.
$C: It all depends. Keep a close eye on the ethics of your ISPs, whomever or whatever they are, and make sure your legislation understands/supports the concept of Net Neutrality.
$C: no they didn't actually.  I was watching the stream live on youtube from Washington post when they forgot to turn off the stream.  Police and bomb sniffing dogs came in and searched the area.
$C: I wouldn't call that a "fun" fact.
$C: It's been neutral since its creation bro. NN was just the name they gave it in 2015.

If you want to keep the internet the way it was pre 2014, you keep NN
$C: It will affect you. 

One of Americas only great exports is media. Any kind of entertainment seems to be produced better in America. Anything from massive produced shows and movies, to small time independent productions. 

These days, the new push is youtube celebrities. You might follow a bunch of people who start out only having a few thousand followers, and then grow to having millions of followers. You may start to see their decline in the coming years. 

If a youtuber has 10,000,000 subscribers, but only 30% of his audience pays for the video package, then suddenly he only has 3,000,000 potential viewers. 

Then you factor in the point where they say only 20% of a youtubers viewers will actually watch their uploads regularly, that means only 600,000 people instead of 2,000,000 will ever see that video. 

10,000,000 is a LOT of subscribers. That's basically best case scenario. So now you start to scale down those numbers to the youtubers who are just starting out and you have a situation where media creators never get started because there are new hurdles in front of them. 
$C: They will probably just put data caps. That's how my fathers country is 
$C: Did VPN's exist before 2015?

Sure did. 
$C: Huh. That's weird, I don't remember us being given an opportunity to vote on this.
$C: Lost, for now.
$C: All of us lost, despite republicans thinking this is a win somehow.
$C: Can't switch to them as probably most people don't have that many options to choose from.

$C: January 1st 2018. The internet will be silent. More fun for the rest world. Teehee
$C: Net neutrality got introduced since ISPs abused their monopoly power. Here is a few examples why we need a open and free internet with Net neutrality. Not that i'm going to be that affected since we have it over here still. For 99.99% of america this will negatively affect them.

Every decision that Trump makes is to basically reverse a previous Obama decision. 

We would have been better off if Obama hated Net Neutrality, because then Trump would have been all for it.

$C: Basically them repealing this makes it so ISPS can charge on the person per person basis of website usage
$C: Basically nothing since the net wasn't neutral under the net neutrality laws anyways. I don't like them but look at how the dailystormer had their registration pulled because the registrar "was in a bad mood" after the sites owner said mean things.... doesn't sound too neutral to me and the law obviously didn't protect that site. 


$C: I don't think non-Americans can really do something. Like, they didn't even listen to Americans, so I think it's quite naive to think that we can help. I also don't live there and I feel bad wathing this, but there's nothing we can do.

$C: If you sort this thread by "new" you'll see plenty of people who want it gone. There's a real possibility.
$C: One step ahead of you, my friend. We're already working with like-minded companies and organizations to evaluate the legal options for fighting this.
$C: Joke's on you asshole, I already saw that on 4chan. 
$C: lol, i think everyone wants internet not controlled by a small group  of people
$C: Well honestly, if I had to pick between losing net nutrality or loosing the 2nd Amendment, I'll pick fucking NN every god damn day.

If the Democrats weren't made up almost entirely of totalitarian gun hating, free speech hating, race baiting, virtue signaling, commie scumbag fucks I could maybe bring myself to vote for them.
$C: Yes
$C: literally no. you will find this is all a scare tactic, we lived without net neutrality just a few years ago without issue. I doubt anyone will admit they were wrong one year from now. Just read about the deal Netflix is doing with ISPs because of this. They are improving our internet infrastructure so you can keep streaming hd video 24/7 (and porn).
$C: No
$C: Or "deals" to 727272
$C: It's good.
$C: If that's true, and it isnt, Democrats want the US to be the next Soviet Union where the State literally owns everything and individual rights don't exist.
$C: *I look at America and its terrible system aswell. The people voted for another but Trump won due to your senators having more power in their vote than yours. Truly baffled by this.*

You are baffled because you obviously do not understand how our electoral college works or why we have it.  The electoral college worked as it was intended in 2016.  The United States is not a direct Democracy and our President is not elected via national popular vote.  On election night there were 50 separate popular elections in each State.  More States with more electoral votes wanted Trump.  If it were a popular vote then California and New York would pick every single President and dictate national policy.

$C: No, it’s currently ONLY America I can’t say it’ll be that way for ever. 
$C: Maybe because the  amount of data the internet is producing is doubling every 16 months. Has been for awhile. Just a thought. 
$C: They can charge you extra to access sites of their choosing, ie a social media charge for 9.99 a month that allows the use of Facebook, Twitter, etc. it’s highly unlikely, but it’s now possible and legal for them to do. They can also block your access to any websites of their choosing for no reason whatsoever. 
$C: I’m happy it’s gone because I.t shows how ungrateful people are. We have internet and we’re complaining and throwing fits. I mean Jesus Christ. 
$C: I am. I'm also enjoying the salt.
$C: It actually proves freedom exists. Less government regulations.
$C: Just an idkot.

Many big companies such like Google and Netflix is against this. In my country where we have net neutrality (since beginning),  it havent effected negativeli to invests. It benefits the small IT companies.

He said that now the IP can "service thwir customers better", i would laugh hysterically if this wouldnt be such a serious mather.  This will give them a right to strangle anybody who wont give them enough money,  and they can charge customers extra if they want access or fast speed on certain pages.

You dont like reddit posts load line you would have a modem? Pay us now 9,99$/month for premium reddit internet package
$C: LOL
$C: You are brainwashed. There was no law about net neutrality until 2014. The internet was free before then. Nothing will change. The internet will continue to be free.
$C: Nothing. Spez is a hypocrite.
$C: It doesn't.  You are literally not going to see a difference.
$C: Racist nazi why the fuck did you have to say Indian?
$C: So going back to the way things were in 2015 is a nightmare for you?  Fucking snowflakes, I swear....
$C: I can't disagree with that!
$C: No you just sit tight until you're out-voted by islamists, then you'll have leaders who actually do something and aren't incompetent appeasing sad weakling meek cuckolds.

$C: Wait so now these so called Russian bought bots became self aware ?????????????????????????????? 
$C: Worth destroying themselves within one year of collaborating with Nazis and facilitating treason by hosting FSB propaganda. Good riddance to these assholes, they have no one to blame but themselves.

$C: [The day Obama Nationalized the Internet](https://archive.fo/TbvP5)
$C: I know, right? Funny how the very same companies that threaten to murder the internet in its sleep (Twitter, Facebook, Reddit) are now all *"saving it"*, as if they give a damn about anything but controlling the narrative and making money.
$C: Im not sure China takes in people who have no value. 
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves. Violence was part of equal rights for Race and Gender. Violence stopped the Nazis and saved millions of lives. Violence created our Country and maintained it. It is a tool and in some situations it is the best tool for the job. This is one of those situations because all other avenues have been exhausted and the powers of the government themselves are being abused So there it is. There is the solution.     

I know you all won't listen and I know we will lose the internet because of it. I hope your ego and pretentious morality was worth us losing one the greatest wonders of the human world. My resentment is no longer just for the corrupt human garbage that pushed against Net Neutrality, but also now for all of you who allowed it to happen just because you didn't want to get dirty to clean up the filth.    

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: It seems like every other comment on these NN threads is a threat or "fuck you Pai." 
$C: half this thread is made up of physical threats against Pai.
$C: don't be That Guy.
$C: No. Do not advocate violence.
$C: Burn his house down assassinate him attack him every way you can how dare he do his job how dare he pass a law that can be undone at any time ???????? 
$C: >You will, each and every one of you, be hunted down and brought to justice eventually. You cannot hide.

This is satire right? I'm supposed to believe some low T leftist is going to hunt me? You would tremble and shake if you ever held a gun lmaoooo
$C: You know what would happen if r/the_donald was banned, right? Imagine if you had a town full of animal abusing serial rapists. That’s a terrible place, but at least they’re all concentrated. If they were kicked out of the town, they would spread throughout the surrounding area where they are even less wanted. You can ban a sub, but you can’t ban all of its subscribers. Better they’re in r/the_donald than the rest of reddit.
$C: “Brigading” an announcement with 101k upvotes on the front page. Lol sure
$C: >You will, each and every one of you, be hunted down and brought to justice eventually. You cannot hide.

Do it faggot
$C: We’re gonna be “hunted down”?? Lmao you people are fucking delusional. This meltdown is better than I thought.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Dude, I'm pretty far left, and you're uh... kinda nutty. T_D isn't the reason Pai is in the FCC and Spez certainly has nothing to do with it. Also, saying Trump supporters need to be hunted down and "you cannot hide"? Calm your tits man.
$C: To promote Net Neutrality you must ARBITRARILY THROTTLE AND BLOCK COMPETING IDEAS! /s

Good job hypocrite. Enjoying your salt.
$C: Who hurt you?
$C: What do you mean by "hunt down and brought to justice?" 
Even as a moderate who voted for Clinton, there isn't anything illegal about voting for Trump. Or Clinton. Or Mickey mouse. Or Mao. There's no justice to be had. 
This statement seems to imply a physical threat, you should probably take it down before you get yourself banned
$C: Pai was a commisioner in the FCC under Obama
$C: [deleted]
$C: > brigading 

Lol we are not allowed to click in to threads on /r/all? 


and wow at your edit... to quote a basic redditor... who hurt you?
$C: As much as I don't like Trump, and that's a ridiculous amount, censoring his supporters for no good reason is hypocritical. People like you just fuel their fire. Grow up and give your political opponents the same freedoms you are fighting for. 
$C: Holy shit LMAO I'm laughing very hard at you 
$C: In this guy’s post, he talks about how deplatforming supporters of a presidential candidate was necessary. In his edit, he talks about how Trump supporters should be “hunted down and brought to justice.” 

And he supported net neutrality because he feared censorship and paying a higher price. 

I’d tell you to look up the word ‘hypocrite’ but you’d probably spew some bullshit lie about being charged by the google search now. 

P.S. Don’t even think about attacking people for their political views. I don’t care whether you threaten a conservative or liberal, if you attack someone you deserve to be put down. Don’t bring that on yourself.

$C: > You should be ashamed of yourselves, and I mean throwing up, crying, staying in bed all day ashamed.

lel, is that what you cucks actually do when you get triggered? Start throwing up, crying, and stay in bed all day literally shaking? That's the best thing I've ever heard.
$C: Could you send some of that salt up north? We need it for the snow. Thanks.
$C: Did your mother forget to buy mountain dew and chicken tendies? Because it sure sounds like she did.
$C: There's no way this isn't a troll, and if it's not, then the account is just presenting a shitty facade of the left for conservatives to jump on.
$C: Stay mad 
$C: > We will not forget. You will, each and every one of you, be hunted down and brought to justice eventually.

Are you gonna be studying the blade in the meantime? 
$C: > you helped put Pai into the FCC and helped destroy the internet.

lol what
$C: [deleted]
$C: How to offend everyone on Reddit at once: the comment.
$C: This wasnt u/spez, and it wasnt T_D, this is now an ingrained problem in american culture and social interaction. This is bigger than what you've made it seem, and its important that we dont fixate on simple idealistic solutions
$C: Better censor opposing viewpoints to promote “free democracy”
$C: LOL LOOK AT THIS FAGGOT 😭😡
$C: Well spez gave the idea of throttling content didnt he by throttling thedonald. 
$C: Haha you really think that your little conflict on reddit has an impact on the FCC's decision? Or Trump having been elected? D E L U S I O N A L
$C: Come and hunt me down, friendo. 
$C: Why are you calling other people triggered when you are acting like someone who is being triggered? Fucking hypocrite.

$C: Hahahahahahah these sweatynerds are on here advocating the torture and murder of government officials and burning down the white house because they might(but probably not) have to pay a few extra dollars a month to play video games online.

You think they're going to *cancel their internet??*  They would legitimately rather be dead than have to face the prospect of one day without screaming the N word at someone on Call Of Duty.
$C: Find another site to operate your cult on.
$C: [removed]
$C: The results are a foregone conclusion.
$C: r/lateejaculation?
$C: Well, there was a status quo, then the company Ajit Pai worked for as a lawyer... Verizon... decided to sue to stop that FCC regulation and either ending Net Neutrality or forcing the FCC to utilize title II. Then Ajit Pai gets made commissioner. 

There is currently no law or guideline to implement that same "light touch" approach of the past because Verizon made sure to eliminate it. 

Fucking absurd. 
$C: You would need hundreds of millions. Big Telecom would just pay more than they already are.

$C: Knafeh. Hands down. If you have ever thought, "how can I find more vehicles in my life for eating warm, melted cheese?" this is the food for you, my friend. Thoroughly convinced that if the 3 pro-repeal commissioners had tasted it they would have forgotten all about this silliness. Luckily there is still opportunity to bring Congress together over net neutrality with this melty goodness. Making a mental note for our next company trip to DC...

Just because you're ignorant, or a blind partisan for Trump and the conservatives who are hell-bent on ruining the internet, doesn't mean damage wasn't being done.
$C: A-fucking-men. This is so bloody tiresome that I'm starting to actually support that Ajit Pai guy. If only there were a way to filter this shit out.
$C: No, but now it can be censored by NBC/Comcast and I bet money they censor conservatives before they ever censor the leftwing.
$C: Exactly
$C: Why does gender matter? Sexism is bad no matter what side you’re on.
$C: MUH GIRLPOWER!
$C: Doesn't matter, even if it was 3 women, 3 humans just voted to change the internet landscape of the 99.99% of the US. That is bullshit in itself. 
$C: Why do you gotta be sexist?
$C: Nice virtue signaling friend but you forgot to bring race and a few other identities into it as well. Would have worked better if you had some POC and some lesbian transgender muslims there on your side, and of course the evil white nazi republican gun owning heterosexuals are against you. Keep fighting the good fight, maaaaaan.
$C: This isn't a gender-based issue. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Reported for violence
$C: there are none  left  and if there is they are from 10-100 with no power  but you think anybody with different political views are nazis ....
$C: As much as I'd like to protest in that way, I need to be online to keep my job.

Find another way though and I'm in.
$C: ehhhhhhh, I wouldn't go THAT far
$C: Next to impossible, given the fact that our politicians constantly receive hefty bribes to prevent such a thing from happening. Today was an example. The vast majority of Americans support net neutrality, and all the FCC had to do is listen to the people and do what was right. They did not. Our government never will.
$C: The vote is by FCC commissioners. Its an Executive branch commission, and not chaired by members of Congress. The three commissioners voting to repeal net neutrality are Republican appointed. The two voting against are Democrat appointed.
$C: This is a serious point, and it is important for everyone who cares about this issue, no matter what side they are on, to remember that no matter how heated the debate gets, it's important to always maintain reason and respect. The great thing about our system is that it gives us many ways to take action, and things are rarely set in stone.
$C: yes he should kill himself for doing his job ?????????? (think this will be a bad thing at least for the next 5 years then it might get better) your  hate for this man won't change anything he's a human like you and me he did his job 
$C: Gay
$C: Now you get to realize that NN wasn't necessary, because nothing will change for consumers.
$C: :(
$C: They just voted. It’s gone
$C: Too late, it was already repealed.
$C: I feel you bud
$C: its already here

maybe you don't understand what is going on here?
$C: [deleted]
$C: The government would love that.  Then they can talk about how terrible we all are instead of actually discussing net neutrality.  I mean they have little trouble coming up with distraction stories/policies without giving them ammunition.
$C: They did that....
$C: I did find it kind of interesting that a member of the media was allowed to remain in the room and photograph the dogs searching. If there was an actual threat then I don't think they'd be allowed to stop for a photo op.

$C: Fuck off fascist.
$C: I've already vandalized my Republican neighbor's front yard and threw a rock at his 12 year old daughter while she was on the way to school. It's important that we cull these disgusting subhumans and stop their bloodlines - early and often.
$C: it wont

It wasnt in 2014 it wont be now

and even so, liberals 100% deserve to be censored after conservatives have been for so long on all major platforms
$C: tbf, its been the exact opposite for most 'left' companies.


$C: Cuck 
$C: There are differences between giant corporations that provide actual content (Reddit/Facebook/etc) and giant corporations that provide access to the content (Verizon/Comcast/Spectrum/etc). 

The business model for Reddit is completely different than the business model for Comcast.
$C: While I mostly agree with you, I don't think it's necessary to assume that the number one concern of mega-ISPs is to keep their customers happy.
$C: You're on a list now, retard
$C: Don't forget to shout Allahu akbar for false flag purposes. 
$C: Pure dogma.
$C: [deleted]
$C: That's basically what we have here, my ISP could block all the shit I love, but that would just drive customers away so they don't.

$C: Regardless of how slimy Spez has been, private websites that a fraction of the population use are a little different from full-scale, arguably necessary infrastructures that millions of people rely on for livelihoods and connectivity.
$C: This started creeping in around 2013/2014 and then the rules were put into place. As an example, Comcast throttled Netflix and then extorted them for a huge sum to restore usable speeds. This was in 2014.

The ultimate redpill is that conservatives and Trump do not have your interests in mind and consistently support anti-internet legislation. Anyone who voted them fucked up big time.

[Just so everyone is aware, this user is a political troll posting false anti-net neutrality propaganda. He has flat our lied and spread false information in order to sound like an authority on the subject. Here he claims to have taken classes on net neutrality](https://www.reddit.com/r/longisland/comments/7eqtuf/lee_zeldins_response_to_my_concerns_on_net/dqcj1vi/)


[But Just a few days prior to this comment claiming he's taken classes on net neutrality he posted an article that misrepresents the fundamentals of net neutrality. Proving he has either been manipulated into spreading net neutrality propaganda he does not understand or choosing to do so on his own free will by not understanding even the definition of net neutrality.](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7etasc/how_to_debunk_a_net_neutrality_supporter/)

Furthermore, his claims of "data welfare" are easily disproven by examining the relationship between multicast ip networks created and maintained by DNCs and ISPs.

[In fact, his whole theory on "data welfare" comes from a copypasta brigade he participated in. There is no truth to his claims. Simply copying and pasting the linked copy Pasta will show several other political extremists like himself that have spammed the same copapasta to the internet as part of a propaganda brigade](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7es1fw/accurate_analysis_of_net_neutrality/)

$C: You realize that net neutrality means the government will monitor the internet more right?
$C: Not stupid, they just were offered large sums of money behind the curtain
$C: in many countries it is considered basic human need. Welcome to 2017, you need it in daily lives
$C: You do realise you are using internet andbenefiting of netnwutrality atm?
$C: >I don't remember any stories from before 2015 about ISP blocking users or any of the horrors portrayed here.

And I don’t remember YouTube inundating everyone’s videos with annoying ads before 2015. But now that’s exactly what they do. Hmm, it’s almost like shit changes...who would’ve thought?

>Porn sites and Netflix having to pay for bandwidth?

Netflix already pays for bandwidth. How do you not know this?? But now, Comcast can charge for much more than bandwidth - they can charge Netflix extra simply for being Netflix. Or, they can simply throttle their speeds regardless of what Netflix pays. Why would they want to do that? Because Comcast owns part of their biggest competitor - Hulu. Comcast has every reason to fuck over Netflix. 
$C: T_D subscribes clearly feel as if their voices are censored. They hate reddit, they hate the mods and they hate the users.

I would suggest going elsewhere if this is your view.
$C: T_D brings the traffic to this garbage site. Remember how when choosing where to place an advertisement, T_D was shown to have more than 6 million subscribers. Reddit collapses without T_D
$C: Did you forget the /s for sarcasm, or do you have no idea what Net Neutrality means in principle?!
$C: Nice job leading by example there, tough guy.
$C: Well, now I feel vindicated in my gut feeling that net neutrality is just about SJW censorship.
$C: That's what's odd about this whole thing to me. The only reason I can think of why they would be for NN is because they wouldn't have to pay ISPs nearly as much or anything at all compared to if NN is repealed.

$C: Is there any evidence of this, at all? I've seen the random dumbfuck 4chan post, but is there anything legit?

$C: That’s the 2nd time I’ve seen this posted and I can’t find any credible source for this, can you point me to one? Not saying you’re right or wrong, genuinely curious.

Just because you're ignorant, or blind partisan for Trump and the conservatives who are hell-bent on ruining the internet doesn't mean damage wasn't being done.

$C: Looks like it. The vote has not finished yet though. The vote is currently 2-2, and Pai still needs to vote, there was some sort of security threat that caused the vote to get shut down and the room evacuated. Pai is about to resume his statement and vote, and it's pretty obvious he will vote in favor of repeal.
$C: Yes. Though officcially has not happened yet. They just pulled the stream on cnn. Police just barged in and started evacuating.
$C: Serena William's hypocrite husband. Why? 
$C: that guy who married the tennis monkey
$C: It gets the governments hand out of regulating the internet. The phrase “net neutrality” is misleading because the government regulates. Repealing it allows companies to regulate as they see fit. It’s capitalism. That’s why they are repealing it. Most want you to think that this is bad because the big companies can set prices on stuff (you don’t have to pay by going to a different company-competition) but I’m thankful the governments hand is out of it. The reason why, Affordable Care Act. When the government has there hand in something, it only gets worse and hinders growth. Look at the innovations that are happening in the space program now that it is in the private sector.
$C: It has the potential to make big companies even richer than they already are, and that's why it's happening.

$C: Why?
$C: .... Did an Indian touch you as a kid? 
$C: Yes. From an idiots perspective, the central morals of capitalism have been upheld. 

Unfortunantly, capitalism doesn't work when it costs billions to start up a business, especially considering businesses already pretty much have a monopoly on this. Capitalist free markets are good for things like shoes, cars, and hardware, where any schmuck can go out an create a product fairly cheaply or at least reasonably. It doesnt work for controlling access to the entire internet. 
$C: 2/10 for effort.
$C: I don't think Hillary could do anything about net neutrality though...president doesn't have any say
$C: How much more pro-Hillary could Reddit have been? Besides banning all Trump supporters.
$C: Can you expand on this? I can't seem to find good reasons to support this repeal even after reading some alt-right websites. Perhaps you can help me understand? Genuinely curious.
$C: I think you aren’t properly educated on this topic 
$C: The truth is woefully the exact opposite of what you think.
$C: what the fuck? The internet is open with neutrality. It's literally a law that keeps it open. It is literally ensuring that consumers can access whatever they want. 

What do you mean "run by the government" that is some ignorant shit. 

You think we should sell our roads to corporations too? Maybe federalize UPS while we're at it? Let's also remove regulations for electricity and water companies. Fuck it, abolish the FDA too - it's just restricting business abilities to do things like add nicotine to children's candy. 
$C: > opens the Internet once again

$C: You want internet like in Portugal?
$C: you a dumb bitch
$C: You’re patently wrong here. Completely.
$C: Shouldn't each state decide for themselves? Or is states rights only for the issue of slavery?
$C: Yea Comcast regulations sound even better! Dumb motherfucker... 
$C: > so why not hold service providers to the same standard? 

Because we can stop buying EA games but in the case of the ISP's many of them have a monopoly in their area and they are the only choice you have and you can't stop having the internet
$C: Saying "less regulation is better" is an ideological belief.  Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't.
$C: >Less regulation is actually better

It's not, there's 150+ years of evidence that deregulation leads to economic recession if not full blown depression.

>these companies are still a problem like att Comcast and other providers because of their powerful influence over the industry.

Agreed. Where does that power come from? Poorly regulated regional monopolies.

> We need to contact them spam them do whatever we can to make sure they keep the best experience for their customers.

lol dude this whole shit show is basically them setting up a legal framework to not give a fuck about you, they know they're a necessity now and they're holding all the infrastructure.

> Look what Happened to EA. They pulled a greedy move, and we gave em hell for it, so why not hold service providers to the same standard?

EA literally does not care about any of that. They will recover and make more shitty games and people will buy them because marketing.

>Like I said if we keep fighting politicians, we won't get anywhere, as a community we need to focus on the root of the problem

The purpose of government is to act as a mediator between parties in order to uphold a civil society. Leaving our representatives out of the picture and refusing to demand that they bring forward the will of the people is the dumbest shit we could do. At that point why the fuck even bother with having a government?

>not net neutrality

This is the root of the problem. Net Neutrality was only put in place because Verizon stepped out of line fucking hard and then challenged FCC action in court.

>Please don't be a sheep and educate yourself on the matter and not simply doing what John Oliver or Steven Colbert tells you to.

This is laughable dude. Can you explain how the backbone works and the different tiers of service providers? Can you explain how internet protocols work? How packet transfer is handled and how packet loss is compensated for? Do you know the history of Comcast throttling Netflix and holding them for ransom in 2014? How about any of the other equally outrageous anti-consumer stunts pulled by the power players in this industry? Do you know how the big ISP's came into existence, and what legislation promted their creation? Do you understand the financial impact of the 1998 Telecoms Act and the complete and utter failure of ISP's to fulfill their end of the agreement? Do you even know what they agreed to do in exchange for tax breaks and subsidies and surcharges? Can you explain how and why encryption is important? Do you have a handle on physical infrastructure throughput caps and routing technology to cope with those limitations?

You're the fucking sheep, bud. I don't fight for net neutrality because someone told me to, I fight because my livelihood and my future and the well-being of my family depend on it. Whose life are you trying to improve by subjecting mine to so much risk? If your answer is anything other than "people who work for internet service providers or hold significant shares of a publicly traded ISP", then I'm sorry to tell you but you're wrong.

$C: What? I don't think you understand what you're talking about here.
$C: https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png
$C: I'm just going to guess you're one of those people who think SJW's are a more dangerous threat to the nation than monopolies and government control. Either that or it's your job to stir shit up.
$C: There is literally no educated person that holds that opinion. You're a troll, a shill or an idiot. 
$C: Sad that you're getting downvoted. The biggest proponents of NN censor a lot and now are crying if companies are going to charge them a bit more for their website. It is time they get a taste of their own medicine. Ajit Pai is the savior of internet. Our next steps is to make sure the FCC cannot place any more NN regulation or straight out abolish it. 

/r/NoNetNeutrality 
$C: Five other net neutrality bills were attempted before the protections (currenly being rolled back) were passed. The reason for the six net neutrality bills is that we were already seeing companies throttle internet speeds, companies with monopolies on certain regions. I don't know what planet you come from or what youre standing for here, but I also don't care. You just sound salty that your edgey subreddits didn't do better. 
$C: How much are you getting paid per hour? 50 cents?
$C: How is getting rid of the one thing that allows the lower class and schools have almost UNLIMITED knowledge?

$C: Well do you really think that reddit and the left are the only ones getting hit by it? What if someone like you or me wants to make a site for right leaning demographic? The isps will heavily censor alt right opinions.The censorship that you spoke off is going to get a lot worse in the future. Just because the left is for something doesn't mean the right has to be against that and vice versa. Verizon and Comcast are both left leaning and they control huge part of the American internet access. We are fucked.
$C: #His Name Was Aaron Swartz
$C: What subreddits did you start? (I'm also ignoring the last part of your comment due to how moronic it is) 
$C: If you shit up their website, they have the right to show you the door.  Freedom of speech is only a protection from government interference.  Private companies can give you the boot all they want, for any or no reason.   
One would think you would get the point and peace out of where you're not wanted, but looks like a case of self-induced, and cherished, martyrdom.
$C: People like you are the best argument against democracy: morons. 
$C: What is it like to be retarded?
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves. Violence was part of equal rights for Race and Gender. Violence stopped the Nazis and saved millions of lives. Violence created our Country and maintained it. It is a tool and in some situations it is the best tool for the job. This is one of those situations because all other avenues have been exhausted and the powers of the government themselves are being abused So there it is. There is the solution.     

I know you all won't listen and I know we will lose the internet because of it. I hope your ego and pretentious morality was worth us losing one the greatest wonders of the human world. My resentment is no longer just for the corrupt human garbage that pushed against Net Neutrality, but also now for all of you who allowed it to happen just because you didn't want to get dirty to clean up the filth.    

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: I'd upvote you but I don't want to get banned for vote manipulation.
$C: Everything you said in your post is accurate.
$C: Here come the downvotes
$C: The government is not a single amorphous blob that can only be supported or despised. For example, you can have varying opinions regarding the quality and roles of different parts of the government like the National Park Service, the DEA, and the Supreme Court. You’re conflating the President and a specific regulatory agency and grossly oversimplifying reality. An individual can have preferences that see them despising the President, but also be in favor of specific governmental policies, bodies, and departments. FCC != “Trump and government”.
$C: no im not a faggot
$C: Fuck no, couldn't be happier after winning so bigly
$C: God no lol thankfully

$C: Really? You are sooooo tolerant I am sure of it.  Get reported and go away.
$C: Its always interesting to see how democrats call republicans crazy for asserting that the second amendment is there so citizens have the ability to threaten/topple authoritarian or otherwise tyrannical governments.....


Until of course things happen democrats don't link, then they threaten to kill people because "its the only way".

$C: Fuck Bernie voters those filthy traitors didn't vote for one of the worst candidates in history that stole the election from their candidate ????!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?! you morons make me sick you wanted a women as president so badly you picked the worst one you could Bernie would have probably beaten trump or at least it would have been way closer you make me sick honestly 
$C: Don’t blame people for voting for a candidate they believed in. Regardless, the popular vote was in favor of a DEM and we still lost. 
$C: This is what we get when old white men don't know how to use a friggin computer. 
$C: Delusional too. Second most active? Pathetic you even think its in the top 10.

$C: [redacted]
$C: > So now the FCC has reclassified Internet Service Providers into Internet Service Deciders. And if you, as a customer, don't like their decision on which sites to throttle or which Apps to block, you are supposed to go to a different ISD. My problem is that I have very few choices for ISD. 


$C: The government won’t regulate it.  The service providers will
$C: If you are looking at your personalised reddit front page you can remove announcements by unsubscribing from the 'Announcements' subreddit.
$C: There are only 5 people voting and the 3 cunts who want to steal the most important tool we have from us have all already said they would. You are clueless if you expect it to go the right way...
$C: Yeah, you're definitely not a Russian troll

$C: >  that was not a problem to begin with?

You have not done any research at all have you? If you had you would never be able to say it was never a problem with a straight face.

$C: wut
$C: He wants money. Loads of it. 
$C: Not what net neutrality means.
$C: You can't be serious.
$C: Sense. Make some next time you comment. 
$C: Ive never seen so many shills to internet companies and big government abusing consumers. The internet doesnt die if Netflix crashes. The internet doesnt end if people arent paying for YOUR internet experience. Title 2 was socialism of the internet, like Obamacare it puts a burden on payers. I'm glad its over. 


$C: It will almost certainly affect smaller sites at some point, shit tier sites that spin off from the donald will be more affected by throttling than top tier sites like Reddit. It will have no affect at all on businesses that choose to censor Nazis though, so not sure why you think that is relevant. it's about traffic prioritization which will almost certainly affect none of the sites you listed. In fact, they will probably get top tier packet priority. 
$C: You may have meant u/spez instead of U/spez.

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: Oh tell us oh #Woke one.
$C: Die please
$C: The vote is literally taking place now. The only one not to speak yet is Pai, so far its 2 Rs for repeal and 2 Ds for repeal. The outcome is a foregone conclusion.

$C: No! It's the GOP's and corporate democrats doing. They allowed Trump to happen. Now we fight them on all fronts, because it's all we have left. 
$C: Pai was hired by Obama. Then Trump was elected-- all of a sudden Pai is the devil.

This is why no one pays attention to you psychos. Your selective outrage is hilarious though.
$C: Why do you believe its wrong for ISPs to make Netflix pay more for their bandwidth usage?

Did you know Netflix and YouTube ALONE account for 50+% of bandwidth usage? Look it up

MILLIONS streaming HD videos all day everyday is a major strain on the internet so they should pay more than other sites

Also, Netflix just upped their monthly subscription fee like 3 dollars last month even though they are making more money than ever before. So Netflix will charge whatever the hell they want regardless if NN is in place or not

$C: Buddy, I have no polite way to put this: fuck off. I don’t care how much you don’t like someone or their policies, advocating violence is idiotic and will only make it easier for those you oppose to paint your cause as evil.

$C: Hillary won more votes than Trump. 
$C: Is it democracy when the people voicing their concerns are being flatly ignored?
$C: These are appointed officials voting based on their former employers' wishes and bribes.  Democracy had nothing to do with it unless you count three people that have said they were going to do something for months sitting down at a table and then doing it regardless of majority opinion.

Think harder about things sir.  This isn't the NFL where you're rooting for your local team.  You have no local team.  You're rooting for people with much more money and power than you will ever have changing things to strictly benefit them and their paymasters.

Duh.
$C: Explain
$C: You do realise this will put lots of Russian trolls out of a job right?
$C: That's only because you are very, very stupid. 
$C: Pre NN, a history:

https://wccftech.com/net-neutrality-abuses-timeline/


Educate yourself please.
$C: > FTC Privacy Regulation, sec.177 Restoring FTC [Federal Trade Commission] jurisdiction over ISPs will enable the FTC to apply its extensive privacy and data security expertise to provide the uniform online privacy protections that consumers expect and deserve.651

Nope, a higher authority called Congress made that legal just a bit ago. Have you been living under a rock or are you just willfully ignoring blatant factual events?

>The FTC’s unfair-and-deceptive-practices authority “prohibits companies from selling consumers one product or service but providing them something different,” which makes voluntary commitments enforceable.502 The FTC also requires the “disclos[ur]e [of] material information if not disclosing it would mislead the consumer,” so if an ISP “failed to disclose blocking, throttling, or other practices that would matter to a reasonable consumer, the FTC’s deception authority would apply.”503

Takes years to get a settlement or resolution through this process, startups can't survive that long. This is by design.

>Many of the largest ISPs (Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, Cox, Frontier, etc.) have committed in this proceeding not to block or throttle legal content.507 These commitments can be enforced by the FTC under Section 5, protecting consumers without imposing public-utility regulation on ISPs.508

Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T have all pulled down their public facing statements on their websites pledging to do this. This part of your comment would be accurate if we were in December 2016. Verizon straight up said in court that they'd be pursuing this if not for Title II regulation.

>Section 1 of the Sherman Act bars contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade, making anticompetitive arrangements illegal. If ISPs reached agreements to unfairly block, throttle, or discriminate against Internet conduct or applications, these agreements would be per illegal under the antitrust laws.518

Again, years of being tied up in courts that small companies cannot afford or survive. But hey, preemptive consumer protection is literally always bad, right? Good thing we don't do that kind of shit with safe industries like Tobacco or Sugar or Pharma, we might cause health epidemics of outrageous proportions. Oh, wait...

>Section 145. P.86 If an ISP that also sells video services degrades the speed or quality of competing “Over the Top” video services (such as Netflix),526 that conduct could be challenged as anticompetitive foreclosure.

Oh so we will just have to wait a few years before they manage to legally get around this. The goal is vertical integration. They want to have a hand in every step of the process, and that stifles innovation and economic growth and the startup culture. Pretty easy to restructure your corporate entities to dodge this entirely, I would imagine. Can't source it, but that's my take.

>ISP who do not have large backend pipes can prioritize traffic by ensuring ping sensitive traffic (online gaming) routes faster then windows updates/video buffering/torrent traffic that can be delivered a few hundred miliseconds slower with no adverse experience on the user end.

Well I have a problem with that. You make it sound like the internet is going to work faster, and that's not what they're going to do here. The internet is going to go at exactly the same speed it would have under normal conditions, but they're going to slow down non-business traffic which fucks consumers unless we want to buy shit. Don't even get me started on games, dude. What happens when Valve pays for a fast lane that a smaller game like Smite can't afford? Because you know that the slow lane will be the default, right? These companies aren't prioritizing traffic out of the goodness of their hearts, they're doing it so that if you want your shit to work like it does now then you had better cough up.

I can appreciate that you're making an effort to defend your position, and you did so pretty well. Only problem is that your entire premise is built on a foundation that is provably false.
$C: Is that you Donald?
$C: It's so cute that t_D users never change and will always justify whatever the conservative party wants. If the conservative party wanted you to all burn yourselves alive, you'd do it. 
$C: You don't know what NN is, do you? It's literally the opposite of what you think it is.
$C: now that my life is gone and by that i mean i  migh have to pay 4$ more for my internet   i want to train as an assassin and kill ajit pai because that will solve all my problems and its not like he did his job and i'm just trying to find someone to blame 
$C: 

No
$C: Uh...im not really sure how paying for internet is "freeloading".  That's some weapons grade stupid right there.  Also, as far as bandwidth prices going up...how are you posting here?

You literally just cheered for yourself being fucked and called yourself a freeloader.  You don't think too good, do you?
$C: Maybe in the coming early days till no one is paying attention... Then BAM they will start sneaking in extra fees and costs. This also sets a dangerous precedent for other shit as well, but who cares I guess fuck it.
$C: Yes all they did was go from title 2 to title 1. NN still remains. 
$C: No, net neutrality is over.
$C: >links to archived t_d

nice try.
$C: He does it to himself so it's free
$C: automatically assuming that anything that is socialistic is bad
$C: Found Trumps Reddit account!!
$C: Did you _READ_ the body of this text? Because of the situation we are in, you're going to hear about it MORE.
$C: Because you won't be going to many sites anymore now lol 
$C: Without net neutrality you could be paying extra for the email (and websites) used to spam you. Won't that be fun?
$C: No, it's not over. No, you won't stop seeing posts about a major corner stone of our freedom of expression. What you could see is a potential monthly charge "everywhere you go" in addition to your regular service bill
$C: Lol once they vote to repeal NN, trust me it's only the beginning
$C: Where did they leave off anyways?
...

Because when the FCC is brought up most people think that theyre just people sitting in a empty room arguing over censorship or something

Or maybe thats just people i know
$C: Exactly. Thank you for actually knowing the situation. 
$C: lol
$C: it's just their salaries. as much as I am for NN. I kinda get some enjoyment seeing these charlatan bozos have to fork out some money to Comcast and Verizon to stay on the fast lane
$C: Around $2.8 million
$C: Curious what the price of their soul was as well.
$C: explain how it harms u in any fucking way
$C: That's not how net neutrality works.
$C: Please keep censoring these clueless idiots
$C: Go fuck yourself 
$C: Die
$C: if that trash of a sub was able to speak to anyone outside of themselves coherently then this wouldn't even be a problem, but no, you have to insult everyone that disagrees because you're all a bunch of children that know you are wrong.
$C: Hey there fellow edgelord, I also like to troll.  Dank memes amiright?!

Pre-NN, a history:

Educate yourself please
$C: You should be a full time cuck translator, you're quite talented
$C: Ron Paul would be against NN.
$C: > most people don't.

I doubt most people even care at all... And even if they do they probably don't really understand what it's about and just bandwagon for or against it.
$C: Some people are born stupid and some are willfully stupid.  Guess which is worse
$C: PAI IS GONNA BE SENT TO PRISON FOR DOING HIS JOB AND PASSING A LAW THAT CAN BE UNDONE AT ANY FUCKING TIME BECAUSE REDDIT IS MAD yeah don't think so 
$C: How is that awesome? The government not listening to the will of the people? 83% of Americans support NN and that voice is ignored. I thought Trump was all about giving voice back to the people?
$C: You seem to be flexing your free speech with no problem on Reddit 
$C: What exsctly are you winnig with this vote?
$C: Assuming you live in America, this is not a win for you, or any other Americans, barring politicians. I don’t understand your kind. I want to, but you make it hard. 
$C: Winning is not covered under your internet package plan! Please upgrade to the Social Media tier for an additional $19.99/mo!
$C: Oh he's got plenty of experience sucking mean cocks
$C: Watch Reddits amnesia set in a month from now as if it never happened. 
$C: Changes aren't going to be made overnight, [according to the Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16776154/fcc-net-neutrality-vote-results-rules-repealed). 
>"*Rather than large swaths of the internet suddenly becoming unavailable or only offered for a fee, internet providers will likely continue to explore subtler methods of advantaging themselves and their partners, like offering data to use certain services for free or speeding up delivery of their own content.*"
$C: Private entities have no obligation to let you say what you want. 
$C: How exactly does "censorship" on a privately owned website cause the removal of net neutrality?
$C: Lmao yeah that's got to be the explanation 🙄

It also helps to know what this whole thing actually entails.
$C: Lol you want to limit free speech and what people can post but you don’t want isps to limit where you post. Sounds a bit hypocritical. Actually, that is hypocritical. 
$C: Do you have any other reason why it is good aside from your self serving intentions?
$C: Not what net neutrality means.
$C: There’s more to the internet than Reddit. 
$C: This level of projection holy shit.
$C: I feel sorry for your family.
$C: I hope you realize that companies could also block your access to conservative media if this goes through.
$C: Yes cause every single left leaning person is to blame.

Stop proving stereotypes 
$C: I’m not a leftist/liberal, but why do you think they called in a bomb threat? and why wouldn’t they want to get their way for this? Nobody should want NN to be repealed.
$C: seems the troglodyte has came out from under his rock
$C: In what fucking world could you possibly want this shit to pass? You literally will have to pay more for your internet service, this will directly effect you in a negative way if you live in the US. On top of that corporations can pay ISPs to prevent users from easily being able to access websites of competitors, smaller companies are going to die, huge corporations are going to thrive, people you know are going to get fucked in the ass by this.

You are either directly benefiting from this by getting paid out by the ISPs like every idiot that voted for it, or you are just an absolute dumb fuck that thinks that anything that remotely seems to go along with Trump's agenda is a good thing. Did you know that it's ok to not have his balls in your mouth at all times? You can disagree with certain things, especially when they literally serve no benefit to you
$C: That's rich coming from the pinnacle of subservience that is the Russian people. 
$C: Yeah! Can you believe we trust the government to regulate the food supply? Or money? Or defense?? What the the hell you idiots! These things should clearly be left to private companies!!
$C: You might be forgetting before 2015 when every website had a surcharge 

Even if they charged a surcharge per website, it wouldn’t be on the customer. It would be on the company. No one is gonna use Reddit/Snapchat/whatever if they have to pay for it 
$C: *You have been charged $2.99 for the first 10 words of your post and $0.99 for each additional word*
$C: Not everyone is made of money, you know. 
$C: it is a step in the wrong direction 
$C: Well, in MY opinion, Donald Trump is better than Ocarina of Time.
$C: The FCC wouldn’t even dare trying to slow down google’s ISP
$C: This is your only comment. By any chance, do you live in Moscow?
$C: Yep will totally be the same, never you mind the massive pay wall that will stop access to sites via intensive throttling. 

Grow up, NN needs to exist or we get taxed just to exist. We live in an age of internet being a necessary part of life and in a world where there are people who simply can't afford that. There's now a price tag on simply existing and even costlier one to learn and grow.
$C: By ensuring companies like Comcast can't charge you per website and control the information that gets to you? Yes. Free and open. 

Do you not see the irony in your own words? You trust a private, for-profit enterprise to control the data you access? You're okay with being charged more just to access the sites you like? 

Try thinking, it goes a long way sometimes.
$C: FTC has a proven track record of not being able to adequetly regulate the internet and is about to lose its teeth if an Iowa spreme court case goes through.

https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/j5dek8/net-neutrality-ftc-rules
$C: Honestly no matter what they did net neutrality a would have been repealed.
$C: When will people wake the hell up and take to the streets?
$C: So you basically want to ruin the internet?
$C: Your brigade is obvious and pathetic. Have some pride in yourself and stop being led around by the nose.
$C: BUH BUH BUH IT'S NOT FREE SPEECH IF IT HURTS MY FEELS


$C: Spez is a hypocrite. 
$C: They're pro making money. If that means censoring the hell out of shit they don't mind. 
$C: You are fucking stupid, go back to your cave you twat.
$C: Why on earth would you be *happy* about this? You either own an ISP or don't understand the issue.
$C: Lmao what a twat
$C: Reddit is fighting for net neutrality but also allowing state and corporate sponsored anti-net neutrality brigades to run rampant on their site lol.
$C: ADHD is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain.  I have no clue why you would make such ridiculous claims.
$C: Also = harder for democrat pedophiles to sex traffic over the internet
$C: Quick now, tell me, what does this vote solve? What problem did the rollback of protections solve? I'll be waiting.
$C: Stupidity levels off the charts.
$C: what are you talking about. Net neutrality has existed since the start of the public internet this is not a return to what the internet was in 2014 this is a removal of a fundamental part of the internet as we have always known it. 
$C: Yeah, because companies weren't already starting to block / throttle competitors... Anyone remember AT&T Blocking FaceTime to push their shit video conferencing?

Oh... right, you conveniently leave that shit out because it doesn't fit your narrative.

They have done it, are currently doing it and will do it even more without some form of legislative oversight. 
$C: We also didn't need laws about cars when they were just a novelty and not a part of modern life. Times change, laws change, and part of that is regulations that have nothing to do with controlling the internet, and everything to do with ensuring ISPs don't control what you can see online
$C: [deleted]
$C: Ehh I just don’t want ISPs to charge me more for my use of the Internet. Or to charge sites I frequent more for their bandwidth use. That’s why I’m participating in the discourse. 
$C: Most are just downvoting you, but I'd like to point out that your comment is the reason net neutrality is so important. 

Net Neutrality PREVENTS ISPs from slowing down ANY site. 

Without net neutrality, an ISP can throttle traffic to a conservative site at will, without any repercussion. So if you happen to have a liberal ISP they could do that to you.

We're all screwed without net neutrality. 
$C: Prepare for a massive amount of down votes
$C: How is data not equal?  100 mb of text takes the same resources to transfer as 100 mb of video.  Do you technical much?

Also,how do the other 1st world nations with nn enshrined make it work?
$C: What if that’s all you have in your area?


$C: This is such a nonsensical view though. I'm in a metro area and Comcast is the only option. Who am I expected to switch to? It's either internet or no internet. This is the situation for a huge amount of people in this country. 
$C: Oh right that's so fucking easy, why didn't anyone else come up with that option before you said it just now... Oh wait, that's because some people (most people) only have access to one fucking provider in their area.
$C: Ahh switch?? Only options I have is ether Comcast or no internet.  God help me 
$C: People have not done their research is the problem. For the past few days I’ve been looking into this more and I believe the name “Net Neutrality” is the only thing people read or understand. They don’t understand the government is regulating things. The name makes them believe the government is not.
$C: Fool, regulations prevent monopolies, effectively promoting economic growth in small businesses
$C: Yeah well you won't be laughing when Comcast charges you more to shitpost!
$C: Actually it's a loss for freedom of speech, genius. Without net neutrality, ISPs have the power to control what messages are allowed to be passed through their lines. As usual the only ones that support destroying net neutrality are the people that know nothing about it. Unless you're just being paid to say this garbage 
$C: They will never admit that they fucked up.  My guess is that they'll claim "da interned is gonna die soooon guis really" for a while and then go silent on it.
$C: Huehue

$C: FTFY
>I wanna shoot ~~my~~ spez ~~all over your tiddies~~
$C: Spez believes in $$$
$C: Now now goyim, please behave. This is a tolerant place for tolerant people and we don't want your controversial opinions.
$C: Coming from the cunt that wants to murder 63 million people because they didn't agree wit him, you belong in a prison cell and left to rot, no need for a trial, your own comments will be used to judge you.
$C: lol insert "hello fellow kids" meme here
$C: Yes it did....they legitimately said they are repealing it. Just cause it has a large R near it doesnt mean it is automatically good mate...... 
$C: Reddit is directly linked to the internet. Reddit isn’t directly linked to abortion
$C: fuck off
$C: Corporate control is the opposite of freedom
$C: Fuck off nerd
$C: Shut the fuck up.

Apologist.
$C: Well have fun with that. 
$C: I don't believe we asked for your help. However, this can affect you as well. When websites and companies that are American based, like Reddit, are forced to pay more for certain things, who do you think will pay that cost?
$C: Just wait until it is a problem for Europeans. Not only will American based websites now be throttled, its possible that other countries follow suit, which could cause a domino effect across the globe.
$C: Europe and North America share the same shit within the market.
$C: No one is asking for your help, we don't want to end up like europe
$C: Hey look. Someone has no meaning in life.
$C: HEHEHHEHEHEHEHEHEHHEHFUCKSPEZHEHEHEHEHDHHEHEHHEHEHEHEHEHEHHEHFUCKSPEZHEHEHEHEHDHHEHEHHEHEHEHEHEHEHHEHFUCKSPEZHEHEHEHEHDHHEHEHHEHEHEHEHEHEHHEHFUCKSPEZHEHEHEHEHDHHEHEHHEHEHEHEHEHEHHEHFUCKSPEZHEHEHEHEHDHHEHEHHEHEHEHEHEHEHHEHFUCKSPEZHEHEHEHEHDHHEHEHHEHEHEHEHEHEHHEHFUCKSPEZHEHEHEHEHDHHEHEHHEHEHEHEHEHEHHEHFUCKSPEZHEHEHEHEHDHHEHEHHEHEHEHEHEHEHHEHFUCKSPEZHEHEHEHEHDHHEHEHHEHEHEHEHEHEHHEHFUCKSPEZHEHEHEHEHDHHEHEHHEHEHEHEHEHEHHEHFUCKSPEZHEHEHEHEHDHHEHEHHEHEHEHEHEHEHHEHFUCKSPEZHEHEHEHEHDHHEHEHHEHEHEHEHEHEHHEHFUCKSPEZHEHEHEHEHDHHEHEHHEHEHEHEHEHEHHEHFUCKSPEZHEHEHEHEHDHHEHEHHEHEHEHEHEHEHHEHFUCKSPEZHEHEHEHEHDH
$C: Censorship of a privately owned website has nothing to do with net neutrality. And they're actually not strict enough on t_D. Literally hundreds of posts on there inciting violence and hatred. Other groups have been shut down for saying the same beings. T_D is actually lucky reddit lets them stay with all the garbage they post.

Also, your argument is terrible. "I hate you guys so I'm glad we're getting nuked. This will fuck me, but it fucks you so whatever lol" 
$C: Hey fuckass, your sub wouldn't have stuff removed if it didn't regularly break the rules.
$C: "communist hand symbol" lol
$C: how edgy
$C: Fucks you up too dummy.
$C: ? It affects you too dumbass 
$C: fuck you
$C: Says somebody currently on the internet.
$C: Obviously you cant do without internet since your on reddit and watching the livestream of the vote right now.
$C: If you say so
$C: Says the guy whose only posts are him trying to get a hit on r/askreddit for karma nearly everyday. 

Edgy af lol
$C: Snowflake much? Jesus christ. "The way you've treated me and people like me" how have you been treated exactly? By whom? Please tell us how you feel raped and violated.
$C: Cuckservative
$C: All major political parties in the US are conservative. It's just that one of them is batshit crazy.
$C: Net neutrality in no way means that every website must give equal footing to all political viewpoints.  You should probably seek to understand what an issue actually is before you form an opinion about it.
$C: Completely agree. 
$C: This has nothing to do with net neutrality and you are not a smart person.
$C: Clearly someone knows jack shit about what is going on.
$C: Was it fine or did you just not notice then because you had no basis for comparison?
$C: Tell me, do you know anything else? It seems like you heard them say that and now you are content with their lies. It’s not that simple. 
$C: >can affect people worldwide 
$C: what do those things have to do with net neutrality
$C: Do you pay for separate services on the internet?
$C: Crawl back to T_D
$C: He is neutral.. to his own ideologies as long as it isn't others'.
$C: See ya in a couple years when you're paying twice as much $$ for 1/10th the web access, you fucking short-sighted dipshit.
$C: Hey fuckass, your sub wouldn't have stuff removed if it didn't regularly break the rules.

$C: it's almost like reddit is a privately owned company
$C: Well? Any answers instead of downvoting me?
$C: You can't spell correctly,  typical trumpy dumpy
$C: Don't you ever get tired of using the same insults over and over? You'd probably eat shit if it meant "snowflakes" had to smell it. 
$C: Go on, scoot back to /r/the_donald - don't need that here, thank you. Facts and reasonable sense are more welcome then insults and inflammatory reactions.
$C: You assholes lost to a Democrat in the reddest state in the union. Fuck off. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: stop
$C: How is that a fantastic win for freedom when most people will no longer be free to access that information?
$C: [deleted]
$C: I didn't think I would read a more ignorant comment today, but here we are.
$C: how?

$C: Look everyone, I found another idiot!
$C: Anyone that feels this way deserves to die.
$C: Found the Russian.
$C: This isn't about controlling what is on a site (this is not changing) it's about how you access the site.  You can keep confusing the two tho. 
$C: Wtf are you talking about?
$C: I think you're a little crazy. The opposite just happened. 
$C: TIL Roy Moore has a reddit account
$C: I'm so sorry you're retarded :(
$C: Heil ptusa
$C: And a hypocrite. And he luvs them shekels.. 
$C: Did you write this comment? Is anyone silencing you? No, we just think you're an asshole. We respect that you can write your opinion, provided it doesn't violate rules that have been established since when you opened the site. That doesn't mean that we have to *agree* with you, and people are free to argue with you. Now, in 8 months, when conservative viewpoints are bad for corporations and Verizon starts to throttle you, that's when you're going to be silenced.
$C: Get an abscess spez. 
$C: Because t_d and EnoughTrumpSpam are both autistic
$C: LOL WUT.
$C: One is not related to the other.
$C: Cause it spreads hate speech and cave man like thinking.
$C: Because opposing views aren’t allowed here. Tow the line or else!!!
$C: hehehehe, poor shitty leftists.
$C: how's moscow this time of year?
$C: Found the bot
$C: All data is exactly equal.  It is an electrical impulse generating 1s and 0s.
$C: >against conservative opinions.

Such as...? 

Pedophilia? Blatant racism? Hypocrisy? Bigotry? Yes, fuck all those opinions. 
$C: So you're saying technologically literate people have a liberal bias? Maybe you should educate your base.
$C: > Competition will keep the internet free.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
$C: ah you’re a cool guy huh

ever heard of cutting off your nose to spite your face? point blank center right here folks
$C: No wonder you call yourself a goat
$C: Say
$C: Yes 
$C: To 
$C: Spam 
$C: I give it a week until you forget you're a dumb faggot.
$C: It cost me a dollar to downvote you, but it was worth it. 
$C: "You faggot nerds can't be mature"
$C: >you faggot nerds can’t be mature

Got a mirror handy there buddy?
$C: 3Edge5You Lololol. If only I was as coolio as you bub.
$C: Pedo Republicans Pedo!
$C: Die dumbass, die!
$C: [deleted]
$C: I'm guess when the idiots and ignorant were born you were the first one out.
$C: Your opinion is bullshit and you should feel like bullshit. 
$C: > ACTIVE IN THESE COMMUNITIES

> The_donald

What a surprise 
$C: Lol ok guy.
$C: How do you figure?
$C: By 2018 it will likely be too late to implement change. This was this hill, we died on it.
$C: Obama appointed Ajit Pai to the FCC in 2012.
$C: Pai was an Obama appointee, so he's definitely not a proxy for the person who appointed him. He's just a douchebag sellout.
$C: Thomas Jefferson did not have to contend with the NSA, the FBI, the CIA, Homeland Security, several branches of the US military, the National Guard, state militias, militarized state and local police  and armed employees in every department of local, state and federal government. Not to mention free lance vigilantes who are armed to the gills.

Guess who tends not to be armed.
$C: I would bet heavily that Jefferson knew how to use "its" when appropriate. 
$C: Thomas Jefferson evidently didn't believe in capitalizing the first words of each sentence.  

In all seriousness though, that is a disturbing quote.
$C: Ironic using that quote in favor of NN. Pacifying is exactly what NN is designed to do.
$C: *its
$C: Only America thinks America is still America.

Not to be mean or anything, but you guys should really travel a little more and see how things are done in the rest of the world. Or read foreigner newspaper, even articles about your own country, to see how economists that are not paid by lobbies see your economy / politic.
$C: This feels exactly like it. 
$C: Seriously.. when has anything a consumer said ever meant a difference. The only thing public outcry has ever done was to stop microtransactions in Battlefront II.
$C: > Did it ever?

Actually, yes. It did in November of last year when 99% of the people bitching about this today sat at home or voted for Jill Fucking Stein, instead of Hillary, the only major candidate that supported Net Neutrality. 

Ya'll could have stopped this... *but her emails!!*
$C: Should the public outcry mean anything when it is on an issue they have no clue about other than the propaganda that Big Media has shoved down their throat so they could regurgitate fear mongering nonsense over and over?

Hmmmm....I wonder why no one serious would listen to that.
$C: 100 to 200 years ago that would have worked. 

That was the point of the second amendment. To be able to take up arms against an unjust government but that kind of violence wont solve anything anymore. Burn some cars and smash some windows and maybe you will get put on the news for your 15 minutes of fame. Nothing else will come of it though. 

Nothing will change. In the next election the Dems will take over and attempt to un-fuck this nation but even then isnt that why we elected Trump to un-fuck Obama's nation?

The cycle continues and all we ever do is pass on the blame from president to president.
$C: Wait....where are you seeing Capitalism?
$C: There never was.

Get a proportional system. 
$C: Money is quite recent in human history.  Take heart.  
$C: These numbers came straight from the 5 FCC members speeches today but I'll do a little digging because Ive seen similar numbers posted around reddit. 
$C: The entire First World has a liberal bias. The American left is still Conservative, everyone has just been brainwashed into thinking that the Dems are commies.
$C: 22 million comments in support of Net Neutrality and public outcries from across all forms of social media diesnt count as We the People? Hell even Fox News was biased in favor of protecting net Neutrality 

$C: What don't we understand? 

The simple fact is that nothing positive can come of this and there is a distinct possibility of access to the internet and the content make up of the internet being severely harmed. 

80% of the population are against this measure. The FCC should not be trampling the will of the people in order to satisfy some vague ideological hatred of regulation. 
$C: Care to explain whats good about stopping NN? Since I'm apparantly just an idiot who doesn't understand it and you're obviously an expert in the field?
$C: Netflix was slow-laned in 2014, you fucking idiot.
$C: "Sure the mass voting populace decided against this but they were wrong so"
$C: Remember when at&t blocked iPhones from using FaceTime in their Network?
$C: You ever read something so stupid that you can't even be bothered to refute their argument? 

This is one of those.
$C: Bots and Russion comments accounted for less than 5 million of the comments. Like I said of the unique comments 95% of them were in support of protecting net neutrality. 

So just dont read my original comment and reply anyway. That's alright
$C: And how do you think those companies will react to the fact they have to pay more? Let you browse like always? Are you that fucking stupid? They'll charge you to pay their fee, and with a profit, because that's how it works. 
$C: It's funny that you don't see the irony in what you just said.
$C: How much time was taken from their job to make this video? As a tax payer I don't want to pay for that. 
$C: Out of touch?  This was 100% intentional.  Ajit Pai was hired to undo Obama-era regulation.  They put the lion in charge of the hen house on purpose.  He's not out of touch, he's intentionally and maliciously attacking civil liberties.
$C: I guess we'll just have to let hindsight do the teaching. Fucking idiots.
$C: Pai Is a fucking retard. 

Reddit and other social platforms allow freedom of speech. 

This is a violation of our rights as Americans. I say we all sue this fucking asshole. 
$C: Pai is just doing what his vzw overlords want. 
$C: What a prick.
$C: I think we need to stop framing it as "they think", because that ignores the malice that could be the underlying reason for all of this. They know exactly what they're doing, and why they're doing it. Censoring the internet and being able to financially limit people from accessing certain services (thereby limiting freedom of speech based on class) increases their ability to get away with malicious and totalitarian behaviour down the road.  
  
This is just them setting things up; we have no idea how ugly this could potentially get.
$C: Ok but where do we stand on cat videos. Because that is pretty important to me. 
$C: Could I get a link to this video?
$C: The fact that he’s so out of touch with the public that he thought that making that video was a good idea is extra insulting to me
$C: Anyone have a direct link to that video? Somehow I missed that part
$C: Do you have a link to the video?
$C: There likely is a segment of internet users out there like that
$C: Saw it in another thread, worth asking again, where the FUCK are all the assasination attempts on these motherfuckers. I havent heard of a single one other than the Congressional softball thing months back.
$C: He has a punchable face. That piece of shit.
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves. Violence was part of equal rights for Race and Gender. Violence stopped the Nazis and saved millions of lives. Violence created our Country and maintained it. It is a tool and in some situations it is the best tool for the job. This is one of those situations because all other avenues have been exhausted and the powers of the government themselves are being abused So there it is. There is the solution.     

I know you all won't listen and I know we will lose the internet because of it. I hope your ego and pretentious morality was worth us losing one the greatest wonders of the human world. My resentment is no longer just for the corrupt human garbage that pushed against Net Neutrality, but also now for all of you who allowed it to happen just because you didn't want to get dirty to clean up the filth.    

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: Maybe there's something the second amendment people can do about it, I don't know
$C: [deleted]
$C: I’m loving this 

You realize this just overturned a 2015 Obama rule 

The internet was around before 2015 so ...... why do we need the government to take over the internet to protect us from other non existent problems that will never exist 

The free market shall control the price 


$C: Because that is what this over it's not about some gigantic ideological goal it's screeching that you may pay more for entertainment. 
$C: Whats worse is we already know we will still be able to do all of those things. What we dont want is to be more money for the exact same services that should be free. What we dont want are data caps on how much internet a household can use, which will impact the lives of many people who rely on streaming or uploading videos to survive. 
$C: ahahahaha i love how triggered everyone is. cry more everyone, cry more.
$C: [deleted]
$C: And r/sadcringe
$C: What video?
$C: basically the only way to boycott would be to cancel all of your internet service.
$C: Verizon
$C: [deleted]
$C: Force your local governments to let competition in. This wouldn’t be a concern if there wasn’t a legal monopoly caused by only having a couple providers per area.
$C: I just want people to stop spreading the obviously false rumor of how Ajit Pai raped and murdered four teenage girls in 1998. He would never do something like that. Ajit Pai did not rape and murder four teenage girls in 1998.
$C: Refuse paperless statements, don't play bills online, don't transact online.

Sorry Amazon Prime, sorry Hulu, sorry Netflix your subscriptions have to go.  Sorry online banking, sorry online billpay, I can't use your services anymore.
$C: Good luck boycotting Comcast or Time Warner

Cancel your internet, your cellular service; never watch another non-disney television program or movie; and stop listening to 80% of the music that exists.
$C: Lobby your local municipalities to provide pole attachment agreements to smaller ISP's or competitors (having a choice between Comcast and Verizon is better than no choice). Lobby you're local representatives to change laws at the state level to allow more competition or allow line sharing. That's how you start to kill the monopolies from the ground up. 
$C: One option would be to look into your state laws, and if they permit it, lobby your City representatives to implement a municipal ISP. 

I'll be getting in contact with mine after the holidays to see if we can push for something like that where I live. We've only got one ISP providing usable speeds as things are, and I figure I could probably spin a municipal ISP as being beneficial to the local "downtown revitalization efforts". 
$C: It seems aji is the main problem. He may have an accident in the near future while jogging. 
$C: Cancel your internet, boycot the major isp.
$C: He's the shrekeli of internet regulation. 
$C: We just need to find some women he jerked off in front of.
$C: [The Cable Guy South Park Skit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSnkrw1ao_U)
$C: He's like an internet troll but with power.
$C: its all trumps fault. No balls.
$C: [Watch it if you dare](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LFhT6H6pRWg) 
$C: Here it is, please down vote it to infinity.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFhT6H6pRWg
$C: It's on the front page somewhere 
$C: I completely condone this 
$C: Yes. 100% yes.
$C: Did he throw anyone off a 16ft high steel cage to crash into an announcers table?
$C: He’s bad enough without making shit up.  Stay focused, people.
$C: How are you so certain Congress will pass it? It's republican controlled and many wrote out support for Pai.
$C: The majority of you also voted for Hillary, but you ended up with Trump anyways.
$C: Would love to know how you know majority of Americans support it

Spez: 🎣
$C: Jesus. The whole point of this post is that the fight is far from over. The court battle over this decision has started and there are already voices (even republican ones) in congress proposing actual law to protect net neutrality.

But sure, we are like totally out of options, better go bomb the FCC headquarters or some shit, that will surely help the pro-net-neutrality movement in the eyes of general public...
$C: There is a much better way than violence. Tomorrow I will be canceling my cell phone service with Verizon and moving to one of the second tier carriers. I will be letting them know that I blame them in large part for today’s vote on Net Neutrality, and I don’t feel like being their customer anymore. If I were an AT&T subscriber, I would do the same.

Yes, I know that T-Mobile and Sprint don’t have clean hands when it comes to net neutrality either, but my goal is to cause pain for the big boys, and I hope you all will join me. I want Verizon and AT&T to lose so many customers that they call Ajit Pai up in tears, begging him to reinstate net neutrality. 

Exercising your right to vote is important. In the short run, making a point with your pocketbook is much more effective.
$C: Well when the people's voices aren't heard you have to turn to violence to change things. I'm not American but I follow American politics very heavily and they will continue to fuck American's in the ass until the elite control a very disproportionate amount of wealth, or the people fight back.
$C: You just gonna copy and paste this on every top comment? I agree with you though. You can see how the bomb scare shook them. I'm not saying bomb them but some kind of violence is the only way at this point.
$C: TLDR
$C: Give it to reddit to call for terrorism and a revolution because they will have to pay more for their Internet 
$C: No.

Translation: I don’t think this is within the authority of the FCC, so I hope congress passes a bill outlawing it as I don’t like it either.

Republicans exist. I want net neutrality and I didn’t want the repeal, but believe it or not republicans hating such commissions is nothing new.
$C: You have a leaky boat, it needs a real haul patch, you have a cork in there now.

Miles from the shore, you just pulled the cork out.
$C: Welcome to our wonderful bureaucracy. Bleh.
$C: Fortunately, Congress can actually override the vote if they do it within (I think) a couple of months. Hopefully we won't fall for a 'compromise' bill, and after we restore net neutrality - we really need to break up these ISP monopolies, otherwise they will continuously hammer us like this.
$C: What a shithead 
$C: At a cocktail party, that would have been appropriate and funny. But in this context--what a jackass! I hope he gets what's coming to him. Via investigation, bribery charges, defrauding the public, etc.
$C: Do you have a link to the speech and “joke?”
$C: And yet he wonders why folks are harassing and threatening his family members. Because this cocksucker is threatening the greatest boon to democracy since the creation of the printing press. 

Fuck him. Fuck his family. Fuck anyone who has any shred of respect for him. I hope his car is hacked and driven over the Niagara Falls.  
$C: His swagged out fuccboi vid.
 Like thats all the internert is for? The fuck either doesnt get it, or does and is mocking us. I cant decide which is worse.
$C: That made me wish I was in a whole other level of crazy when he turned her into something to laugh about. Sadly I am not :( . Yet 
$C: Pai is the Ted Cruz of the FCC
$C: We need to do something about him.
$C: Pai, the shithead. Tried to defuse her statement afterwords. What a worthless human being
$C: Despite everything, it makes me smile knowing that people like her still exist and are willing to fight.
$C: Jesus fucking christ the smug response by Pai afterward - "I'm gonna mark you down as a no," *chuckle chuckle* - makes me want to smash his face. 
$C: He fucking laughs at her. This whole thing is a joke to him.
$C: "I'm gunna mark you down as a no?"

What a fucking cunt.
$C: How does a guy like him sleep, man? 
$C: I'd pay $50,000 to absolutely obliterate his kneecaps into a thousand pieces with a good old fashion bat.
$C: Holy fucking shit. That gave me goosebumps, I'm so pissed. So fucking unprofessional.
$C: Wow, I'm lost for words after that last fucker made his snide comment. Such a lack of respect and decorum.
$C: "I'm gonna mark you down as a no, then?"  
This is all a game to him. He's just having fun. Like honestly what the fuck? What a disrespectful ass  
I'm not even American and that smug comment after her well worded, heartfelt speech bothered me enough to make a comment on it.
$C: Got a better video? That one has awful quality. 
$C: Holy shit. The self restraint that woman has to have not physically struck pai at the end there.

Fuck me. What a pathetic, wicked little man.
$C: I reached out on Twitter and thanked her. I may send her a hand-written card. I could tell she was fiery under that calm façade; we need more people like her in our government.
$C: I don't know that there is one just yet. She basically said the FCC and ISPs know what Americans want, but they don't give a fuck and are going to do what's in their best interest, not ours. Then she ended it by throwing some of Pai's old statements up in his face and reminded everyone that the fight isn't over. She finished, everybody was dead silent, and Pai said, "I'm gonna mark you down as a *no*...?" and there was a smattering of nervous chuckles throughout the room.

Edit: u/SaggyBagz posted a link to part of it above.
$C: The speech she gives after the vote is amazing. 
$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdxAPTammxs

Here ya go!
$C: Literally, what? Do you have a link for that? The only things I could find were of her concerns about censorship and repression.
$C: I imagine it must feel weird to talk out of your ass.
$C: Found Ajit Pai's Reddit account.
$C: It’s kinda cute how your own statement contradicts itself and you don’t even realize it.
$C: r/the_donald
$C: Will of the people < ~~bribes~~ donations
$C: Isn't what you're doing here with your comment an example of strawmanning? Although what you're talking does is an important topic, it doesn't really say anything about Reddit as a company's stance towards the topic at hand here: Net Neutrality

And I'm actually curious, is that metadata handover a problem? Is it used for anything other than annoying ads? I hate ads as much as the next guy, but they're nothing more than a superficial annoyance. 
$C: How many times you gonna post this keyboard warrior shit?
$C: edgy
$C: https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/7xwknx/republican-members-of-congress-fcc-letter
$C: Seriously. I can't read my own signature most of the time. Much less someone else's. 

Edit: Ah it was that McMorris Rodgers bitch! She's the only one that didn't return my letters.
$C: Just don’t vote GOP.  that’ll take care of it
$C: Yes, [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_members_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_United_States_Senators). You're looking for the red ones.

$C: Most likely *someone* will run against them in their primaries (I believe several primaries have already happened in Illinois and Texas?). Whether that someone is a candidate that'll get any votes may vary, but it never hurts to try.
$C: I suppose you just mourn the fact that America is a terrible excuse for a democracy.
$C: Find someone to run. 
Seriously. 
It doesn't have to be you, but I bet you know good people-- why not them?

If you aren't involved already, I would encourage you to connect with your local Democratic Party (most states have Central Committees in each county) or your Democratic Socialists/Democratic Progressives (most major urban areas have a formal organization). 

Help out with the process. Make the GOP compete for EVERY FUCKING SEAT. Do not concede a single legislative district. For too long, the GOP around the country have maintained seats that were "not competitive" for the Democrats (and were ignored by state and national Dem groups; a serious error on their part!)

NO more. Every seat needs to be competitive. 

If you aren't comfortable being "out and about" politically, there are plenty of behind the scenes volunteer work and activism opportunities available. Again, your local Central Committees will be able to help you get involved at your interest level! 
$C: Do it you're the perfect candidate
$C: You should do it. No more excuses. Be the change you wish to see.
$C: Run anyways even if you get killed you made the other guy work for the vote... that’s the important thing 
$C: Encourage someone you know who's smart and charismatic to run. They'd have a hail Mary chance just by doing nothing. But they could totally win if they gave it their all.
$C: Right? Honorable in what sense? 
$C: First read I swear it said "horrible". Took me a minute.
$C: I know, what asshole nominated him for the FCC?
$C: https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/7xwknx/republican-members-of-congress-fcc-letter
$C: Thank you!
$C: It's literally the only way to make them notice.  Strict party-loyalty is not helping the U.S.
$C: That is a great form letter right there. It takes no stance, but has two paragraphs that sound like he is on your side, no matter which side you are on. All he actually says he will do is "keep your thoughts and concerns in mind."
$C: I'm curious if these guys have any shame or do they have it surgically removed.
$C: Seriously. $1.6 MILLION. What a piece of shit.
$C: [removed]
$C: Campaign funds.
$C: When your spouse beats you, only one type of person mulls over all the other things they don't do that aren't beating.
$C: I think it represents something bigger than just net neutrality at face value. It’s more that they are willing to go against the obvious will of the people in favor of corporate interests. 
  
If my options were that or someone who may not represent my values but will at least represent a subset of the people - I would rather have the latter. 
$C: 71% of Republicans and 83% of Democrats support net neutrality.  (Source: https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/06/06/new-mozilla-poll-americans-political-parties-overwhelmingly-support-net-neutrality/)  That is massive bi-partisan support that a lot of people chose to ignore in favor of bribes.  Those people can't be trusted to represent us.  
$C: I think it’s the overall idea that this is an issue a LOT of people actually agree on and their reps can still completely ignore what voters want because they can get paid for it. Now it’s public knowledge that they can be bought (some for a shockingly low amount) so what’s to stop this cycle from continuing for every issue that would be bad for consumers but great for business? 
It speaks volumes to their character that they’ve essentially sold their votes. I don’t want someone like that representing me - my interests and the interests of those in my community clearly don’t matter. 
$C: Yeah, that's an intelligent response that will certainly help further the cause...
$C: Sure, if that happens. But remember there's virtually no chance that that happens - they want the ability to moderate speeds based on content, which means they're going to charge someone more to modify that speed. That means either they're charging *you* more for prioritized access, or they're charging the *company* more, and then that company has to pass that cost on to you. Even in the very unlikely scenario that your internet bill drops $1, you're then paying $10 more to Amazon, Netflix, your game subscription services, the FCC's own example of your hospital that wants priority medical traffic, so they can afford their prioritization.
$C: Hahahahahahagahahahahahhahaha 
$C: Lower prices, same speed, access to everything as-is, no advertising injected into our data, etc.

Yeah, never happening. 
$C: TIL some people don't know people exist outside of Reddit and have been very active and vocal. And by people I mean tens of millions of people.
$C: Made three calls, all went to voicemail. I'm sure this is okay though. I just left voicemails with who I was, why I was calling, reciting the script, then not requesting a call back unless necessary.
$C: Realistically, this congress is not going to pass a bill to overrule the FCC. The gop controls the committees, the house, the senate and the presidency. It won't even get out of committee for so much as a floor debate, or to be voted on, and the people behind this nonstop NN activist campaign know that. You're fighting a war you will not win right now, because the elections are over and people are seated.

The best thing NN groups can hope to accomplish is bring awareness to what is and will happen, and then try to get people mad about it to cast votes for democrats in the future, who will support NN, and ensure that all the costs of content delivery fall onto ISPs and aren't shared by content sources like Google (youtube) and Netflix, who account for nearly half of national bandwidth usage. Netflix doesn't want to charge you more. They'd rather ISPs pay for everything so your ISP bill rises rather than your netflix bill. This is a battle between corporations disputing who is responsible for infrastructure costs.

Keeping costs low is especially important for sites like reddit, imgur, facebook, etc. who provide free use and try to make money through ads and other means. The last thing they want is ISPs charging them for heavy bandwidth usage. That's what this is really about.
$C: We already did that too. 
$C: >Emphasis mine. And this is why this entire point is a fool's errand. There is no more rule. There is nothing to be submitted. The rule was created during the Obama FCC. This vote repealed it.

While the vote had the *effect* of repealing the 2015 order and it's classification of ISPs under Title II, what it did was *replace* the order with [new rules](https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-17-60A1.pdf). These rules are not a simple "the 2015 order should cease to exist", but 75 pages long. They are a different set of rules entirely. [This](https://www.freepress.net/blog/2017/11/22/fccs-order-out-weve-read-it-and-heres-what-you-need-know-it-will-end-net-neutrality) article gives an overview of what they entail.

Congress is perfectly capable of overturning those 75 new pages.
$C: One thing that was explained to me as a benefit would be for things like the release of a new Game of Thrones episode.

Special infrastructure could be built to improve data releases like that, where 10s of millions of people are wanting exactly the same thing at exactly the same time. But that new infrastructure takes funding, and it is for a rather rare occurrence, so they would charge HBO a bit to use the new system for each of their releases.

That sounds fine to me, and under to repealed rules, would not have been possible.

NN is important, but there are things that could be improved upon other than a blanket statement that all traffic must be treated exactly the same.

I agree with what you mentioned, make the contracted speed the legal standard for all data, but companies can pay more for better than baseline. Or like where T Mobile (I think) removed Netflix from the data cap for streaming (more questionable, but still).
$C: Fixed! Thanks :)
$C: What are your suggestions for better tactics?
$C: We have to go to DC to get them to cooperate. Flood their offices. They'll listen when their office has a mass of angry people in it.
$C: I'm sure someone will take the FCC to court over this and get the decision overruled. But I don't want to sit on my hands waiting for that to happen. 

I've been strongly against Congress trying to pass a law, because Congress is technically incompetent. However, if all we have to tell them to do is say the word "NO" to a specific FCC decision, with no guesswork as to what results we're going to get, then Congress is potentially useful. Since this is something I actually trust Congress to get right, then this is something I'm interested in trying to get Congress to do.

If someone is going to spend hours and hours on this issue anyway, spending 5 minutes on a phone call to someone who is capable of using the social machinery already in place to affect a situation in the direction you want it to go is a more efficient use of time than doing nothing while debating with oneself as to whether the tactic will work.
$C: Why not both?
$C: [deleted]
$C: Uhhh. That is their job though. Unless you mean it should be a states' rights thing though, which is a valid argument.
$C: You think the legislative branch shouldn't create legislation?
$C: Are you fucking stupid? If you are, I'm sorry for being mean.
$C: [deleted]
$C: this article has a good list of links of sleazy things ISPs have done over the past 10 years years to break net neutrality. it's a bit long so you can ctrl-f "the verge" to skip to the list incidents https://getvoip.com/blog/2017/05/01/net-neutrality/
$C: Bittorrent throttling. Only it wasn't labelled as a net neutrality issue back then but an anti-piracy thing. And there was generally no option to pay to have access to it again. Unless you consider people buying VPNs to work around it (and boy did VPNs make $$$ hand over fist) but I digress.  

The capability to do it is all there. All that remains is get the population to accept it. Flipping on a drastic change over night does not work with any product or service.
$C: God knows who. I'm sure there are a dozen organizations that will file a suit soon.
$C: So the way to save the internet is to lose the internet. Gotcha!
$C: I'm not giving up the internet. I can't live without it. This is fucking ridiculous.
$C: But but but mah vidya gamez and mah facebook.

I NEED internet so I can tweet my dinner and text my boss about how I will be sick tomorrow..... /s

Go back to nineteen nitey-fucking-five and complain about how you cant survive without internet or cellular communication. You'll get told to shove it ya prudy twat. Not now, everyone has a reason they NEED to pay the ISP, just how the ISPs want it. Younare all brainwashed fools, and I WILL eat my hat and post it here if that ever changes. It wont though, because if it would, it would have happened with any of the previous  million issues we already let fly by. People have proven time and time again that they just dont care enough anymore.

Edit: not directed at you OC, just towards the sad sad idiots that compound this issue. Sorry if you thought I was attacking you, I failed to make that clear that I was aiming it at the problem, not at you.
$C: We gotta make them vote.

So call your reps on both houses to get that ball rolling. And no "Well my rep said this and won't budge!" nonsense. The will of the people is strong if we decide to keep it strong.

You keep calling, and calling, and calling until they FINALLY listen to you.
$C: If they go to court these repeals won't take affect right away.

Don't give up after a simple vote. It is very tough but we can fight this and got a good shot in the court system.
$C: They won't do it immediately, that's just bad business.

They'll wait a few years so they can say, "see? We're self regulating, we don't need net neutrality in law!" so Congress will become complacent - if they do it fast they risk retaliation, especially in the current environment (plus, if it gets reversed by Congress or a lawsuit or democrats in 2018 or 2020, they'll have wasted money on the systems they'll need to build to do this).

Just like their strategy with data caps - apply changes slowly so people get used to it and you win in the long run.
$C: Well maybe we need to band together and start doing protests in the street. PEACEFUL protests.

We did it earlier in the year with the Women's March. I have to imagine a topic like this will get people together en mass too.
$C: Netflix seems to be against it since the day this was announced. But people like Google or Amazon aren't going to say shit cause they are too big for this. They will be find regardless of what happens.
$C: They probably won't
$C: SO what’s changing exactly for the average joe and what makes your information not disinformation
$C: Literally my thoughts
$C: > Imagine EA in charge of the internet!

THIS
$C: You have other options where you are? In most of America, ISPs are functional if not literal monopolies.
$C: Most people who are against net neutrality are either straight up lying or have no idea what it actually is, if they're not speaking in extremely broad terms. "Will restrict innovation". What innovation?
$C: Isnt bribe taking illegal?
$C: I have a feeling that I'll be fighting to keep the net open till the day I die.
$C: They ain't seen the last of honey boo boo ain't nobody got time for this bullllshit
$C: What about mods of removing pro-net neutrality comments: https://i.imgur.com/mAlEf32.jpg
$C: Don't you think it's time to do something about the Russian influence on this site? America is literally under foreign attack and reddit is a port of access for that attack. You need to take responsibility for that and take action against it.
$C: Will reddit be putting up money to fight the FCC here or is the current plan just to do PR about how we need to keep fighting? 
$C: > They don't know us very well.

We know you guys very well.  You're cowards and liars. That about sums it up.
$C: > Checks and balances are a part of our system. 

Forgot "but we at Reddit HQ don't have checks and balances!"
$C: Reddit went mysteriously silent during all of this, with no official protest, and nothing but a handful of comments about how great our own posts were on one day.

You're a part of this and you should be ashamed.

You thinking it isn't painfully obvious that you wanted this repealed as well?

Disgusting
$C: [deleted]
$C: >They think we'll give up. They don't know us very well.

Damn straight. Bots don't give up until they're turned off!
$C: >disregard for public opinion on this issue.

Yeah, it's a travesty that he ignored those hundreds of thousands of Russian bots supporting NN.
$C: Time to move to Washington State lol 
$C: Republicans just saw a Republican Candidate lose in ruby red Alabama.  Sure, he was legendarily unpopular, but that’s the type of thing that will make every Republican in a purple district a little nervous for their seat. 
$C: I'm gonna repeat myself in this thread, but why should the FCC (and therefore the president through appointments) even have control over NN?  It's the job of congress to write laws that govern telecommunications. Current law is an amendment of 1930s law last changed in the 90s before the internet got big and influential. 

I think Title II was a decent workaround/bandaid and I'm sad to see Pai's punchable face succeed in this, but we need new law to fix this problem. 
$C: Agreed, but like the FBI handles the mafia, and Mueller is handling Trump you work from the bottom up.
$C: Yeah, too bad we're all broke af
$C: God, I hope so.

If nothing else it should be illegal to do so with the explicit purpose of helping outside interests at the expense of representing the American people.
$C: The FCC (executive branch) shouldn't even have control over NN.  The reason we have this problem is because our telecommunications laws are old as hell. 1930s law amended in the early-mid 90s before the internet got huge.  Congress needs to write the law so that Title II isn't even needed as a workaround that can just be see-sawed back and forth depending on who's in the White House. 
$C: They’re using the Ellen Pao strategy?
$C: Agreed, but like the FBI handles the mafia, and Mueller is handling Trump you work from the bottom up.
$C: Drop Verizon. Any alternative is better. 
$C: Huh, thanks for pointing it out. It looks like I fumbled and added an extra number. Here it is (also editing original post)

$C: Thats the problem, they no there is no future so they are cashing the fuck out
$C: Historically speaking the US has been getting more conservative as a general trend over the last 50 yrs, not less
$C: If any president deserved to be impeached, it should be Obama imo.
$C: Too bad a majority of Americans don't get a choice in their ISP...
$C: The problem is that boycotting an ISP means going without a largely-necessary utility. It's like boycotting the local water/power/sewer company.

As much as Pai and the rest of the douche crew like to talk about having an "open market," most places are under a local monopoly where ISPs are concerned.

You can't just *not have* internet these days.
$C: And you know what will let them continue to do that with impunity? You being discouraged, crawling back into a hideyhole and pretending none of it's happening, that you can do nothing.

Apathy and lack of attention is specifically why the shady corrupted bullshit gets a free pass in the first place. 

Read the thread, this has gotten a lot of attention that the bullshit won't stand the light of day. It's not going to stop here and they won't be able to let it slide.
$C: You're 100% correct. This whole thing is a fucking joke. "We sent them tens of thousands of letters and millions of emails that told them not to repeal neutrality so now we have a record that they didn't listen!" Wtf exactly is that supposed to do? The same people that just rammed a cock down your throats are now supposed to look at this record and miraculously give a shit and expose themselves as corrupt? The depths of slacktivism knows no bounds.
$C: *rolls eyes* hardly an overreach to use pre-existing rules.
$C:  Never happen?  They already happened and the FTC and FCC's new plan say that those things are perfectly okay with them as long as they are mentioned in the ToS somewhere.

- /u/spez 12/14/17 ~2:30 EST
$C: Thank you. I'd give you gold for this but ... well ... you're him. Giving you gold would be like giving Tim Cook an iPhone. He's got plenty.

Edit: I think getting my first gold on this means by the laws of reddit, I have to send Tim Cook an iPhone now. Is that how this works? If I get another gold do I have to send him an iPad too? I've confused myself.

Edit 2: Darn it guys, now I gotta buy Tim Cook an iPad. I don't even know which size he'd want. What's next, I gotta spring for an Apple TV, too?

Edit 3: Holy crap, you guys, I'm not made of money over here! I owe this guy an iPhone, an iPad, an Apple TV, next thing you're gonna tell me is he gets a Macbook, too!

Edit 4: This just isn't fair. It's Christmas time and I have presents to buy. It's not like I can run out tonight and pick up a Mac Pro for the CEO of Apple. You guys gotta cut this out.

Edit 5 and 6: Look. I'll level with you. I'm sitting here surrounded by Apple products addressed to Tim Cook and I'm running out of ideas. What do you people want with me? You want me to go buy him a literal bag of apples? Like just a bunch of gala apples for the CEO of Apple?

Edit 7: This is getting out of hand, folks. The people at the mall and the grocery store are giving me really, really weird looks. I literally have nowhere to sit, there's so much A(a)pple in my apartment. I suppose now I gotta also send him Apples to Apples too?
$C: [deleted]
$C: What if they block Reddit? What then?
$C: Seriously, thank you. Companies don't have to be schoolyard bullies dangling you upside-down for your lunch money. Show that you love and support us, and we'll love and support you right back. 
$C: What the fuck is happening to the USA lately?  
It's like the people are getting ass fucked and don't give a fuck
$C: I fucking love you guys. Thank you for your support of NN. 
$C: that's m'boy 
$C: 10/10 response.
$C: Damn son
$C: >No. We don’t negotiate with terrorists.

But you acquiesce to /r/The_Donald all the time. If you want to fight NN, maybe clean your own house of its supporters?
$C: thank you for calling them Terrorists. This is attack on our constitution and our democracy. It just hasn't been defined officially yet since this is new territory.
$C: Good on you
$C: This got my dick hard
$C: Spez for president 2020.
$C: Guys, this is a sound byte, treat it like one. The Reddit management will do what is good for the overall good of the company (which is absolutely correct). Please don't start salivating.
$C: You're a liar and a hypocrite. 
$C: My man
$C: That’s hot 
$C: Saving this for when you inevitably go back on this promise ;) it's the Reddit admin way!
$C: Didn't you personally remove any helpful links for americans abroad during the Brussels terrorist attack?
$C: t_d still exists.
$C: Why is /r/the_donald still around then?
$C: Fuck u/spez and net neutrality
$C: Yet, The_Donald still remains. And they enabled this. They've been cheering on about this for months... until they realized it affects them too.

Do us a favor, and put up or shut up. Because this is just ~~PR otherwise~~ lip service.

edit: word change.
$C: are you sure you don't
$C: prediction: this won't age well
$C: Nice.
$C: Ok. Contact your legal department and make it binding. 

I wanna see some real action. 
$C: Unless they feel unheard and their views represent a large part of the country, right?
$C: Maybe you should act like that's the truth and tell that to r/t_d "moderators."
$C: Watch /u/spez change his mind in the next coming years if Net Neutrality does indeed end.
$C: of course not, you just allow them to post and recruit on your site unhindered

please get fascists, white supremacists, etc. out of reddit
$C: This is why you aren't taken seriously. What a stupid comment. 

I am certain that nothing that comes of of the NN repeal will happen, but now I kind of wish it would. 
$C: Funny that you seem to negotiate with Russians though.
$C: Yes you do.

You actively give r/The_Donald a voice in all of this. Their constant brigading, doxxing, and outright harassment has broken the rules on here many time. But you, and everyone else who runs Reddit, continues to do nothing.

I'm sure you are all for Net Neutrality but I also know when someone is being whipped into keeping a hateful sub around. Either get rid of T_D once and for all or you need to give those 8 people back their money for giving you gold.
$C: You fucking caused this by allowing The_Donald to fester. You should be ashamed of yourself. 
$C: r/The_Donald still up?
$C: Get off my plane!
$C: Good dude

!RemindMe 1 year
$C: Thank spez.
$C: I appreciate this I would rather see how bad they are going to make it rather than you give in and give them what they want. I really hope a lot of other internet companies follow suit and fight back by only making the internet providers customers angry and them. If every website is slow people will throw the blame on them without even knowing what is happening.
$C: Can we expect a warrant canary type of action that will allow to determine whether or not you've entered into such an agreement in secret?
$C: Could you post what their offers are publically? 
$C: You negotiate with mods all the time.
$C: \*cough\*superdelegates\*cough\*
$C: Good, but we're already suffering with how slow this site is now.  I'm going to have to stop coming here as often since it got so slow today because of those Republicans since my blood pressure just can't handle the anger of what they have done to us.
$C: So why don't you take a proactive stance and start blocking consumers from from a isp's who support this?

I get that it's all of them but it netflix, google and other services said fuck you we won't serve to X customers until the isp agrees to Y terms? 

Right it probably would be too risky and costly for share holders. I hate everyone involved in this right now.
$C: You just capitulate to those that want their safe spaces for the sake of profit and refuse to answer questions or do anything about it. But good on you for taking a stand some where.


$C: Shut the fuck up you ugly lying cuck
$C: No, you support them by censoring opinions that decry their foul ideology. 
$C: Kinda like reddit stands for free speech? Will be interesting to see how that changes when money gets involved.

$C: You the best, spez!
$C: Then don't go public.

$C: Good u/spez

$C: <applause>http://www.markething.cz/wp-content/uploads/image1.png
$C: would you sign onto a package that would reroute requests from fox news and the Drudge report to Reddit though?

that might help get neutrality back
$C: This is a good answer.
$C: If the Internet.io project approaches reddit and says they're giving free Internet access to reddit, Wikipedia, and Facebook in various poor countries, are you willing to sign that deal?
$C: r/murica
$C: Well said.
$C: Good. And if everyone takes that attitude, they won’t be able to get anywhere.

$C: Source?
$C: Without any source I call it bullshit
$C: "some traffic is more equal than others"

Alright, as much as this screams that you're a troll, it's still frustrating to hear someone say something so fucking ridiculous immediately after calling out everyone else for not understanding. You didn't even explain how people were wrong, you just ignored the problems completely and expected us to what, take you at your word that we're wrong?There's already proof that ISPs will unethically throttle competition, so what makes you think that they will stop now that it's also legal? You actually believe that it's only going to make it EASIER to access whatever content we want? That's naive at best.
$C: The only people who think its good are either shills, trolls, or ignorant. No real people actually believe in this shit. 
$C: *paid shills who 'actually think' this is a good idea
$C: I think we need to send letters to the president and the White House. We might not like it but we need to remind him that net neutrality benefited smaller conservative website like Bretbarb and even Alex Jones to grow. That’s not fake news for him so people need to try that. 
$C: Most of them are just mentally unstable and delusional. 
$C: You'd hate /r/nonetneutrality and /r/libertarian.
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves. Violence was part of equal rights for Race and Gender. Violence stopped the Nazis and saved millions of lives. Violence created our Country and maintained it. It is a tool and in some situations it is the best tool for the job. This is one of those situations because all other avenues have been exhausted and the powers of the government themselves are being abused So there it is. There is the solution.     

I know you all won't listen and I know we will lose the internet because of it. I hope your ego and pretentious morality was worth us losing one the greatest wonders of the human world. My resentment is no longer just for the corrupt human garbage that pushed against Net Neutrality, but also now for all of you who allowed it to happen just because you didn't want to get dirty to clean up the filth.    

 Down votes to the left, losers.

$C: It's probably a good idea to give the FCC even more control then, right?

$C: I'm sick of hearing "OBAMA ERA REGULATIONS"

we get it you guys are on the republican team

$C: Because it might. Less regulation lets ISPs be more commpetitive and innovative. 

What we need next is a change in local/state level policies that lets smaller companies create competition to the huge ISPs who have regional monopolies. 

That is how consumers will really start benefiting. 
$C: if they want competition, we need to break up every single local monopoly they have.  Force them to give us the product we want, or let us get it from someone else.
$C: dox pai if your pissed. spread his home address for every loony to see and go to. Make sure his mailing address is included for every s&m  magazine. 
$C: so much ignorance on this thread.  you guys are actually under the impression that government control INCREASES competition?  are you fucking kidding me?  I mean it's almost as if nobody remembers what life was like prior to 2015...absolutely insanity and ignorance.
$C: Maybe when the stock market crashes we can rebuild everything... again...
$C: > The major argument for repealing seems to be "let's go back to bipartisan and how the Internet flourished before 2015. Things were fiiiiine then and I'm sure the telecoms won't try to screw people in the future if we go back to the way it was!"

The people spouting this truly don't remember how things were before 2015 nor how we ended up with the Title II classification.  There were *many times* the FCC had to go after ISPs for shady network practices (I'm sure some redditor has the list handy, I've seen it posted around).  The major ISPs took the FCC to court, and the court said that the FCC couldn't continue enforcement against the ISPs unless they reclassified as Title II.

$C: "But anything government is bad because the government hates freedom, and corporations are just good smart people who are trying to run a business in the American dream, so I'm gonna vote and support people in government to enforce these ideals because I hate government."

Every fucking trump supporter
$C: Look at how quickly they repealed it though.

Meanwhile when there are onerous taxes or regulations that harm people and are a huge burden, nobody seems to be able to repeal any of them. 
$C: dox pai. use the 2nd amendment. take back power from corporate interests. 
$C: America watched Republicans drive the country into a ditch in the 2000s and then decided to give them a chance to do it again. 

No one who was paying attention should be surprised. 
$C: > yet people still vote because (R) in the name.

That's because that's called the Southern Strategy. "No Southerner will EVER vote for a Democrat!" - Southerners 1960's.
$C: Or they'll just blame it all on whatever liberals are left in politics. 
$C: > Thats been the Republican way since ~~Obama~~  Nixon.

FTFY


$C: > Thats been the Republican way, way before Obama.

ftfy
$C: Both sides are extremely polarized in what they vote for which is the problem. That being said, an overwhelming majority of both parties were in favor of not repealing this which is very impressive. 
$C: The Republicans will just blame the Democrats for the mess they make. And many of the Democrats will just take it. 
$C: Soooo..... We’re just gonna pretend that the Democrats aren’t just as bad? And then demonize the other party and its voters? Cool...
$C: and corruption will stop when people like pai start getting doxxed, and shot.
$C: Obama appointed this guy at the advice of Mitch McConnell. It's all public. 
$C: No but since both parties are sold out, they should go and we should put people that represent us in.   No more corporate bought legislators ever again. Can't be trusted.
$C: Don't be fooled.  The shills voting for this repeal don't think they're fighting for internet freedom.  They're not idiots.  They're fighting for the dollars that are being stuffed in their pockets as a reward for getting this done.
$C: Ball game* and no. 
$C: What has changed since these rules were put in place? 
$C: Doesn't make it okay. 
$C: Advice that applies solely to those who live somewhere with more than one broadband provider, a notion that is far from universal even in the most metropolitan parts of the U.S. I'm only 50 miles from NYC and nonetheless don't have that "luxury."
$C: Dude common people had and still have no control over selections such as that, at the upper echelons of our currently corrupt system.

This Hillary whataboutism is

a) harmful to meaningful debate

b) aimed entirely at the wrong crowd


Lay off!
$C: Keep eating your buttery males, dude.
$C: lol ok. 
$C: I've got 65% odds Trump doesn't complete one
$C: HAHAA
$C: Now the fourth one is gonna be real tricky. Fifth is actually gonna be comparatively easy, he hasn't planned a sixth because Vice President Ivanka will probably succeed him during the fifth term. Let's be real, you can only plan so far ahead for someone in their 70s 
$C: Who had lobbyists in this?  Telecommunication or consumers?  I watched the vote live, and it's easy to hear in the rhetoric.

Like when one said, "no company would stake their reputation on practices like these [throttling, fast lane, and blocking]."

Yet we already know that they have done these things. Also, often times we have no competition to take our money to when this happens.
$C: More like if you're not stupid you can see they're obviously being bribed
$C: It's almost as if the Republican party is directing us into corporate anarchy.
$C: My understanding is that without NN regulations ISP's could sell stripped down internet plans that only permit access to a limited number of websites and services, and then offer additional access à la carte (i.e. "Unlock Netflix and Hulu for just $5 more per month!"). So in theory, these "basic internet" plans could be cheaper than what's currently available. Although to even call something like that "internet access" I think is a sick joke, and a total bastardization of the original intent of the platform as a medium for open exchange of information. 
$C: Careful you don't cut yourself on that edge. Feel free to attach images of yourself inciting violence in an attempt to stop the repeal of net neutrality.
$C: Ok Ajit
$C: It seems you missed the point. No one thinks the internet is going away, they think that it's going to get more expensive and partitioned and less open. No one wants to spend more than we already do. I don't see why anyone as a consumer would be for paying more and getting less.
$C: Pai has bribe money shoved so far up his ass it's covered his eyes and ears. OP is right, our only hope is to vote them out. That and/or riot. 
$C: Not fucking once. They don’t care about the people, anymore. It’s been decades since they genuinely have. This disgusts me and is an embarrassment to what is supposed to be our great nation. 
$C: All the crazy ass libertarians support the repeal. They're the only people I've noticed though. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: I think I might be sick also. I'm so fucking sick of everybody getting away with this shit just because of money. WHAT CAN I DO?! For the long run really. Can I become a lawyer? Do I need to become a lawyer, or just read up on law really well? Nobody's going to take me seriously unless I have a name. How do you make waves that are going to actually move people. One person rises up, it isn't enough. Get over 100,000 signatures, it isn't enough. What if you find hard evidence that public officials are taking backdoor bribes to pass laws(or hard evidence that they're killing masses of people), nah, that isn't enough either.
FUCK THEM! IF THEY AREN'T LOOKING OUT FOR US THEN WHAT ARE THEY HERE FOR?! I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA! How do you create a rebellion to overthrow a corrupt government in the world we live in today? No one's going to join, And if you do, it always turns violent because nobody has regard for human life anymore. How are you supposed to combat that? And when a psychotic fucknut starts killing in the name of piece and overthrowing the government, they get shot or imprisoned immediately. But when you take 20 years to find a spot of power and do 10 times worse then that one person did, you can pay your way out of it and live your life normally. Nobody's got any credibility anymore, nothing is transparent, nobody is in it for anybody else, and unless you have a way into power, YOU ARE FUCKED!  So, there really isn't much anybody can do. So, I'm going to sit back, get fucked by the system, and yeah... Play Zelda I guess. The Nintendo switch is pretty nice.. 
$C: Won't the corporations just buy the next batch of politicians?
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves.

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: Dude it's fucking memes, relax 
$C: >I'm physically sick after watching these overinflated bags of hot air puff around. We as Americans have GOT to get out and vote these shit stains out of their seats. They've made it into an Us vs. Them argument, so let's finally show these bought-out soggy biscuits who actually controls their careers.

You can't. The FCC is not elected.

This is what decades of big government hath wrought: unelected bureaucrats making laws.

This was a Republican vote, but the Democrats have helped set up this situation for years. 
$C: But what if some of us don’t want Net Neutrality?
$C: Do you guys really believe the 80% number when most people don't even know what net neutrality is? What was so wrong with the internet for all those decades before the year 2015?
$C: Except he is eating up the attention. He doesn't give a fuck.
$C: And Congress can put the brakes on this as well with a simple majority.

Let's see if the republicans care about what over 80% of the nation supports.
$C: Maybe unelected buricrats shouldn't be given powers that Congress has, or powers that Congress doesn't even have under the Constitution.
$C: Because House Republicans wouldn't let Obama and the Democrats do it properly any time after 2011, so the only available option to implement net neutrality at the time was through a rule change at the FCC. If Clinton had won in 2016 and Democrats had taken back Congress, they could have codified net neutrality into law and thus taken away the FCC's ability to repeal the rules by a mere 3 votes.

Remember, elections have consequences
$C: Never forget that Pai was put in by Trump.
$C: Congress can still stop it, but it's controlled by republicans, who want this anyway despite more than 80% of the country being against it.
$C: Do you know what the Supreme Court is? 
$C: Report them to the [NY attorney general](https://ag.ny.gov/fakecomments) anyway, you can pick your home state in the form.
$C: I am sure there are fake comments on every issue. It really isn't relevant.
$C: I agree with you. Sometimes, I sit and think about all of this and I begin to wish I wasn't an American citizen because I hate this country. I'm disgusted what politics has become here and how corrupt the government is. It makes me legitimately angry that the peoples' voices aren't being taken into account by a lot of politicians.

And then I realize that if I give up, what does that make me? Where does that leave my voice? I can't make the US a better place if I sit on the sidelines. I have to do my part and vote these asshole out of office and empower others to do so if I can't do it myself. So, I'm still here and I'm still so angry I want to beat something up. But I'll make it. I'll survive and come out on top because evil like this cannot be tolerated. 
$C: At this point I don't think we can place the blame fully on people's apathy.  Obviously that played a massive role in allowing this to happen, but I think there is also a large component of malice from the GOP.  It seems to me that they are using every scummy, underhanded, downright evil tactic in the book to confuse and divide people so they can sneak in during the chaos and rob us blind.
$C: Always read, as many sources as you can so no one can "sell you a wooden nickle", or fool you with emotional claptrap.  This way you'll see through the celebrities, and use facts to come to your own conclusions.  Party is obfuscation of thinking.  Shine on thinker and help fix stuff!
$C: Imagine being this assblasted 
$C: The best shot is the case the New York Attorney General is working on.

$C: https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueMidterm2018/
$C: Good chance for the House, not so much the Senate, but that's only because there aren't that many Republicans Senators up for re-election in 2018 whereas a bunch of Democrats will be defending their seats, some in red or purple states. 
$C: The House will be hard to take because of partisan gerrymandering but thankfully Senate elections don't have districts. 

I'd take a split House / Senate over neither any day of the week. Obstructionism by the House would be frustrating, even debilitating, but it at least wouldn't be regressive. 
$C: Despite all of this, Donny’s boy Roy Moore just lost. Keep at it. We’ve got the numbers.
$C: The worst thing you can do is give up a battle over your home because the opposition is unfair. 

And for what it's worth, almost every contested national and state election has a non-voter total that exceeds the vote differential. In other words, just about every election can be won, period, with more turnout.
$C: Aside from all that, the FCC chairs are appointed by the president, not voted on. So you literally can’t vote them out... 
$C: Both parties bend the rules for their own interests. Both need to be held accountable to the people.
$C: Dems have been caught doing all the same shit dude.
$C: He didn't say anything about our votes being rigged. I think you mashed together a few sentences there.

The FCC vote today is a mockery of representation. In that, you are correct. But we also have a Democrat*ic* senator from Alabama now. *Our* votes do seem to matter.

Edit: no typo, no typo, you're the typo
$C: I think he’s talking more about how people seem to think “Both parties are the same” while the GOP pulls shit like this. The way to ensure that the FCC is more bound to the people is to elect a president and a Congress that actually represent Americans. 

The people that we voted in last year couldn’t have been more blatantly bound to corporate interests, but we have the opportunity to change that next year.

If you are in a state with a Senate seat up for vote or in a House district up for vote -- volunteering to help on the campaign can make a difference at getting the word out. 

The census is coming up in 2020, as well. While less "glamorous" -- State legislative elections are also going to be of critical importance to help correct some of the partisan gerrymandering that's made it so difficult to see proper representation in the House. 

If you're introverted / worried about the political climate -- there may be options to help out that don't require you to interface with people. Get in touch with the party you associate with or a candidate campaign office that you support and help out.

$C: #woke
$C: That's awesome! There's also a higher chance you'll run into the legislator if you visit their office in DC while congress is in session. If you do, do not hesitate to corner them for a few minutes and talk to them on the issue!
$C: We compete with volume: with lots of their constituents bugging legislators on the issue repeatedly. I've seen it work for other issues first hand. Here's why it can work:

Ultimately, congresspeople want donations to their campaigns to help themselves get elected. But having a lot of their constituents being mad at them is a much more direct interference to getting elected.

Legislators are people, too, and nagging works! More specifically, it changes how they see the world.

A few years back, at the height of the tea party movement, someone did a fascinating study: They surveyed every member of the House and asked them to estimate how conservative/progressive their district was. The result? Almost every legislator, no matter where they were on the political spectrum, vastly overestimated how conservative their districts were. Why? 'Cause that was when the tea party was often literally surrounding every congressperson and bombarding them with crazy demands.

I saw this bombardment first hand: I attended a few town hall meetings hosted by a Republican congressman as part of a campaign to try to pass comprehensive immigration reform. What I saw was that tea partiers showed up in droves to every one of them, and they yelled at the congressman nonstop. I remember one guy got up, practically spat at the congressman's face and accused him of being a traitor all because this Republican congressman hasn't impeached Obama yet over Benghazi. It was in this kind of environment that saw Republicans go far right and resist even the most moderate of policies from Obama. That particular Republican congressman I observed started out as a pro-environment legislator, he wound up turning into a climate change denier.

I've seen it work for the progressive side of things, too. In New Jersey, we got that Republican congressman (and a few others) to flip their vote on Trumpcare from yay to nay after continuous protests, office visits, phone calls and confrontations at town hall meetings.

It's like [this gif](http://www.strangezoo.com/images/content/183463.gif): where the congressperson is the car, and we have to be the pestering sheep!
$C: This would be a chance to put someone in that seat who is pro-Net Neutrality! Pester the candidates gunning for that seat, when they want your votes and support is the best time to ask them for things! It's also an opportunity to flip the seat!
$C: If you are from the district that they represent, you *will* get a meeting. It may take a while depending on the time of year (e.g. budget season is tough), but at minimum you will get a staffer's full attention for half an hour.
$C: I should've made it clearer: The offices are opened to the general public during their work hours, you do not need to make an appointment or wait for an opening to go in, speak to the staffers and leave a comment!
$C: We've come full circle, it's the Commonwealth that must save America from Tyranny!
$C: The continent? What country are you from? 
$C: Non American here, what would happen if the next President was a democrat and he was for NN? Would it be possible to reverse any decision made today?


$C: That wouldn't necessarily work, virtually EVERYBODY wants NN except the people who decided to try and take it down.
$C: I agree, but it sure would have come in handy this time around. 
$C: I don't recall voting on Pai
$C: Sorry but if I have to pay more for my internet I'm not going to try to start a war.
$C: Yeah the Founding Fathers just knew that someday, citizens would have to take up arms in defense of the Internet.


Give me a fucking break. This kind of violence incitement shit just gives the regulators even MORE excuses to ignore people. 
$C: When was the last time anyone said the word democracy and actually meant a direct democracy? Because we sure as hell live in a representative democracy.
$C: Got to say if you want to put a point up there don't be a dick about it
$C: This is revenge for the phone call computer scams.
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves. Violence was part of equal rights for Race and Gender. Violence stopped the Nazis and saved millions of lives. Violence created our Country and maintained it. It is a tool and in some situations it is the best tool for the job. This is one of those situations because all other avenues have been exhausted and the powers of the government themselves are being abused So there it is. There is the solution.     

I know you all won't listen and I know we will lose the internet because of it. I hope your ego and pretentious morality was worth us losing one the greatest wonders of the human world. My resentment is no longer just for the corrupt human garbage that pushed against Net Neutrality, but also now for all of you who allowed it to happen just because you didn't want to get dirty to clean up the filth.    

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: what note?
$C: I’m honestly surprised this is the first time I’ve seen some form of threat, violence or otherwise.


Surprised people didn’t hack into his personal shit, find something and spray it all over the internet or threaten him at home.  


This is what the pissed off internet does.
$C: It's a good plan, but I worry he might enjoy it a little too much...
$C: I'd rather watch a pig fuck him.
$C: Did he bring either up yet? I'm scared beyond comprehension.
$C: Violence is the discourse of the desperate, but I won't stop reminding the rich about JFK's words: Those who make peaceful revolution impossible, will make violent revolution inevitable.

It's the "inevitable" part that gives chills to my spine. Are the people in power aware of the possibility of local extremists taking justice upon their own hands, after they make people feel desperate and powerless?

Seeing up all of Trump's excesses, the selling of the country to monopolists, sometimes I wonder how much the US can take before it goes down in flames. Mind you, the US is still a very young country. The Roman Empire fell, even with all its power. Is the US more powerful than that? I don't think so. It's just a matter of time. Let's watch that doomsday clock tick, shall we? After all, it's just [two and a half minutes till midnight.](https://thebulletin.org/timeline). Don't mind that it was 7 minutes to midnight just fifteen years ago.

Time passes, the rich and powerful keep playing, and the clock keeps ticking.

$C: Why would they kill NN if it will affect them also.
$C: You wouldn't be able to, it only happens for small sites.
$C: The guy above is a mod at r/nonetneutrality , and has been spamming this message all over this page, because he's either completely pathetic or (and I mean this for the first time in my life) a paid troll.
$C: I strongly object to the use of violence because I don’t see that as a viable path - I think it’s super important to note that we have this problem today because people don’t fucking vote. Voter turnout is beyond abysmal. If 2/3 of americans were voting instead of 1/3 and we were still getting shit like this rammed down our throats, maybe violence would be more of an option. 


No matter how fucked up this all gets, let’s not lose sight of the fact that any violence committed by either side is violence against your fellow neighbors and fellow americans. It’s a last resort option, not something to jump to. 

I’m also optimistic that Trumps legacy will be waking up everyone to the fact that their votes matter. I mean look at how many people are watched and are discussing an FCC meeting, or how many people starting to pay attention to hearings in the Senate. There is a lot of negative and horrible shit going on, but it’s possible this is all for the better. I won’t downvote you for your opinion, but I do hope that we can all work together to turn passion like yours towards getting everyone engaged in voting before moving towards violence. 

I hope you and everyone here has a good weekend coming up. 
$C: > three ghosts of the free internet

That would have been amazing.
$C: His speech at this point is just going to be "There you have it, suck my dick America! Verizon for LIFE! *drops mic*"
$C: Pai knows there are no repercussions for anything he does, and he doesn't have to answer to the people. He knows who butters his bread and who he really answers to. He will make sure he takes care of the oligarchs, as they take care of him. 
$C: I never expected him to change his mind. Unfortunately money speaks louder than Reddit.
$C: That's this week's SNL skit dude
$C: I think the point is the wording "was predictably frustrating" insinuates the vote is already over. Though I don't disagree with you, I thought this was the case until seeing this comment chain.
$C: All the money that bought out Pai says their was no threat and the security scare was BS.
$C: Well, in D.C., they say -

That Ajit Pai's wallet grew three sizes that day! 

But,

Whatever the reason,

His heart or baguette,

He stood there on Christmas just hating the 'Net.

Staring down from his office with a sour, Trumpy frown

At the fast fiber optics below in the town.

For he knew every Redditor on Reddit was there,

Enjoying high-speed streaming with nary a care.
$C: This is getting crazy.

Edit: Looks like things are settled down. Fuck Ajit though, lying through his teeth about all of this.

Edit 2: Piece of scum. That's it. This battle is over, but the war is entering a new phase. Keep pushing, keep fighting. We can't let our voices be silienced by corporate greed.
$C: Mignon. Her name is Mignon Clyburn.
$C: lol at the scared look of his face. 

This coward should remember that feeling. 
$C: Would be awesome if it did get bombed with Pai in the room
$C: Denial is a hell of a drug
$C: They cleared for an emergency recess but it was pretty clear it's ending today. 
$C: during their statements they've announced their positions. it's currently 2-2.

E: "At the advice of security we need to take a short recess" - Interesting. They stood up *fast*.

E: Doom's back on, boys.
$C: didn't both comcast and *verizon* throttle down netflix?
$C: AT&T blocked facetime
$C: Yeah but with NN I'm still getting data free Spotify so there's that.
$C: My bit torrent downloads usually take about 3 minutes,I dont know if im just paranoid, but its taking me 15 minutes instead now -_-***.
$C: > Madison river communication which blocked VoIP.

Which was resolved using the rules that were in place at the time, the same ones that he is changing back to
$C: There's no point in posting this though before the vote. All it does is make people confused and the top voted comments become concerns about this being made before a vote occurred.
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves. Violence was part of equal rights for Race and Gender. Violence stopped the Nazis and saved millions of lives. Violence created our Country and maintained it. It is a tool and in some situations it is the best tool for the job. This is one of those situations because all other avenues have been exhausted and the powers of the government themselves are being abused So there it is. There is the solution.     

I know you all won't listen and I know we will lose the internet because of it. I hope your ego and pretentious morality was worth us losing one the greatest wonders of the human world. My resentment is no longer just for the corrupt human garbage that pushed against Net Neutrality, but also now for all of you who allowed it to happen just because you didn't want to get dirty to clean up the filth.    

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: I got livid when he started talking about bitcoin mining. Lies lies lies lies lies. Acting like bandwidth is even remotely important or strained with mining.
$C: his gigantic chicklet teeth
$C: Spoiler: it's all of them. 
$C: I mean I'd bet everyone took their cell phones lol
$C: thought It said they were on a 'Bribe break' at first.
$C: Possible bomb threat, dog sniffing dogs were brought in
$C: What's next is walking it right back over in 2020. Fuck the GOP.
$C: Since we clearly have no power in government maybe time to consider violence?
$C: Put things on the record has legal ramifications during subsequent lawsuits...that and people should actually care about this subject and express themselves.
$C: Yes they have, the statements they are making ARE their votes, and this now makes two yes votes. We're only waiting on Pai. We're done.
$C: Yup, enjoy your furry fetish porn before you have to pay extra for it and be humiliated by your ISP!
$C: Not that he needs it - the people that can vote have made it abundantly clear for weeks (if not months) both how they will vote and that public opinion has absolutely no impact on how they will do so. 
$C: Not canceled, recessed. They'll be back. 
$C: Too bad didn't get bombed, had fingers crossed
$C: [deleted]
$C: It is.
$C: Yeah, and then in true shitbag fashion, *completely ignoring the meaning of the comparison*.

It's supposed to be "we don't want for-profit entities to run uchecked charging whatever they want for a basic necessity", while Ajit Pai was making the case that "The internet has to grow, and is not static like sewer lines"

And we're all over in the corner going **"Fucker, even sewer systems have to grow! holy shit what's wrong with you?!"**
$C: Um, last time I checked sewers are utilities.  By comparing internet traffic to sewer lines he's making his opposition's case.
$C: Hey thanks!
$C: Congress can still kill the repeal, but you’ll have to call your rep.
$C: we all get raped by comcast
$C: [removed]
$C: “They don’t care if we are alive or dead, we are a product to them”
The definition of State, right there. They own us, literally. Democracy is only a means of domesticating us and auto legitimize themselves. But in the end the state is only an illegitimate criminal organization. 
$C: Because a group of people once upon a time actually did something about net neutrality & put regulations into place banning it. A group of people in the govt are still fighting for it. Look at those people. Vote those people in next time. 

Edit: supporting NN, not banning it. 
$C: The French had some good ideas... 
$C: I don't know about you guys but I'm 100% supportive of tar & feathering public officials. If you betray the country or your constituents you should be punished severely for it. 

Since that isn't happening, well... you'll get previously reasonable people to change their beliefs regarding what kind of punishments are acceptable. 
$C: Agreed. #rise

I'm tired of resisting, it hasn't done anything. It's time for it. Our government hasn't worked in the interest of the people in a while. It won't stop. We need to rise. 

I don't condone violence, but it seems to be the only option to me
$C: Problem is, it would turn out more like the good old American or Spanish civil war...
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves.

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: I swear, if I wake up tomorrow the head of some kind of revolution, the title of the news will read, "Man who was joking has no idea what happened.".
$C: It isn't good when the fascists people in the military will HAPPILY gun down Liberals if they take up arms against their government, but if those same Conservatives in our military WILL turn their automatics against a LIBERAL Government; should they just not like us, like they did with Barack Obama. Sucks the people with military training are generally just brainwashed conservatives because: "Muh Flag". Get some brains in those brawn militarytards!!! 

It's a Hypocrisy.
$C: No you fucking don't.

We're VERY VERY VERY far from that point.

That's the last resort and to be used when you have secret police disappearing people in the streets, etc.

Edit: All you people advocating murdering people you disagree politically with **NEED TO GET PSYCHOLOGICAL COUNSELING NOW**
$C: Lol Jesus Christ. Didn't get your way on one matter and you want a revolution. Calm down John Wayne.


This law has only been in place for 3 years, I hardly think it's time to burn down the white house.

And
Has it occurred to you that there exist Americans outside of reddit, outside of your bubble, that don't want the govt involved with their internet?
$C: But they are appointed by our elected officials. 
$C: Ya, I probably should have made that part a bit clearer, but i'm just angry right now. I think it's important to point out that they are appointed by our elected officials, however
$C: I am saying we should become violent.

EDIT: Best thing we can all do at this point is to go out and cut wires if you live near one of the offending ISPs. Cut as many as you can. Every wire you cut will cost Comcast or Verizon money to fix. A few million cut wires in a week will hurt them in the only place they care about.

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: French Revolution brought decades of terror, war and instability.
$C: What aré some ways we can effect or influence holding these politicians accountable? 
$C: Which would lead to a civil war. Especially given how polarized things are right now. I also highly doubt that the states would recognize a government brought on by a coup staged in Washington.
$C: It's not your right to do anything illegal.  Revolt and be violent all you want, but don't be surprised when you land in prison and have your life ruined.    
$C: Good luck with that.
$C: Great! 

Now let's go back to the last administration and repeat that same sentiment. Still feel the same way?

Once we break it, there's no guarantee it will go back together. And it is a hell of a lot easier to break something than it is to rebuild it. 
$C: Sorry, where in the Constitution does it offer the ability to revolt (presumably with physical violence) against our own, elected government officials?

Only modern-day Republican voters got us here - the Democrats aren't perfect, but they didn't take our Net Neutrality away.  Heck, even Bush Jr.'s administration started the analysis which led to Net Neutrality regulations under Obama.

Voting *is* a right we have, not revolt

EDIT: To the downvoters - put up or shut up, really tired of your chest-beating insurrection BS, which fully plays into Russian social network riling up of actual USA citizens.
$C: Would you need a bag of chips with that?
$C: This action today is obviously proving your point beyond its validity. They do not give a damn if you're angry, they'll do it anyway. They'll speak about "protection" and  inheretly altruistic actions to support small businesses and the free market, when they very well know what the result will be: More privatization and exploitation of consumer-friendly practices. Hopefully congress gets a leg up and tries to repel this through the CRA. 

I don't even find jarring that those 3 would blatantly spew so much bullshit in front of our faces like today, just to fill their pockets, it is expected now. 

I'm not inherently nihilistic, but shit has gotten to the point in which that I would look the other way when it comes to some of these people and their safety. Someone less sane than I is gonna snap, it is bound to happen. 
$C: I will admit your comment needs to be upvoted more.  Its not about giving up, but as it stands, youre right.  Our voices dont mean a single fuck.  We need to think bigger.  I know if i call my indiana rep or statesmen or whoever, ill most likely get a recorded voice or nothing.  It is appalling just how small the voices of the people have become.  I sense a revolution on the horizon and am honestly surprised there have not been actual riots or violent attempts made on crooked politicians.  

But, keep your heads up, guys.  Just from the years ive spent on reddit, i can see how drastic this upcoming generation is from the aging generation in congress.   We will get our time in the sun.  At 32 years old, i still have hope for this country after these backassward dinosaurs have all croaked.  Keep fighting the good fight and dont forget to vote!

Over the years, we will slowly start being the majority and it will be our time in the sun to...  sigh...  make America great again.
$C: unless your net worth is in the tens and hundreds of millions, you're an insignificant speck to those in power. 
$C: [removed]
$C: This is how a government pushes its people to revolt though. The Russian revolution was caused by hundreds of years of autocracy, and people being oppressed, bad leadership and so on. All it takes is for this to keep on happening and then the government to make 1 big short-term fuck up that just pushes it all over the edge. It's early days, and I don't think a revolution will happen or even be attempted, mostly because everyone will (hopefully) vote for it all to end in the mid-terms and 2020 election.
$C: I disagree that we should abandon peaceful protest. I don't want death or violence in the streets. I want us to be better than that, to be a society where we don't have to fight like that.
$C: I agree 100%
$C: Why not? Because inciting violence, especially violence that results in a political assassination is a pretty big fucking crime?
$C: I want to see Pai in jail and out of power. Not dead.
$C: We aren’t lobbyists, Congress can and will continue to ignore us as long as legalized corporate corruption continues to be legal in this country.
$C: Trump for 2020 because Verizon says so! He's been doing a great job as president because Fox News is in your starter package, and if you have any doubts, you can pay $19.99 per month for the News Package for access to Fake News sites.
$C: So maybe all these letters people are sending need to be sent to these companies instead.
$C: Is there any to keep caring about the rest of humanity even at the height of your richness, because god knows all rich people are psychopaths let alone sociopaths
$C: But Bernie!  Trump and Hillary are equally as bad!
$C: But the people we do elect, appoint them. 
$C: Yeah, thats why they shouldn't have this power to begin with. Thats why theyre getting rid of title 2, so something like congress can make it a law instead. 
$C: Which is probably why they shouldn't be allowed to create laws disguised as regulations. 
$C: Except it turned to this over the years. It first started as the land of the free. And I still respect it for that
$C: Terrorist and guerrilla assaults never incite change though, beyond making constant war the status-quo.
$C: I'm not advocating a bloody revolution. I'm simply advocating for consequences. 
$C: Yeah, not sure what is going on here, but it scares me. You know what people remember? The womens march last winter, The people of Alabama voting against Roy Moore despite the seemingly impossibility of winning. These are powerful messages and they work. Just vote like Alabama did and these people that are in power, hurting everyone, are done. 
$C: Voting isn't working. The vast majority of people don't support net neutrality repeal, and yet it was still passed. Hell, Pai was appointed by Obama, and I bet in excess of 80% of Democrats are against net neutrality repeal. So how is this incongruence happening? 
$C: Then we should start a different subreddit or (if shut down) a new internet home with advocacy for more extreme opposition. Organization is necessary, when individuals do it they are easily blown off as nutjobs or demonized and people listen because the media tells them so.
$C: Shit, it doesn't work on mine.  I've got turtleface to deal with.  
$C: >because Trump's the one who appointed Ajit Die

Pai was first [appointed to the FCC by President Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajit_Pai).  
$C: Feel free to elaborate. It won't actually affect me (yet), so I'm always interested in hearing both sides of the story. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: FYI I'd never downvote because of an unpopular opinion - only when someone is a dumbass and taking away from conversations.

It's actually quite funny because I study economics at university, and there's uproar here too about how the US might set a precedent for it to happen elsewhere (read: the UK). I think that where you've mentioned competition and game theory is actually a very good point, and one that I hadn't linked to this whole FCC/Net Neutrality fiasco that's currently going on in the states.


I think a lot of people are of the assumption that if the FCC chairman and others can effectively be paid into repealing net neutrality, then they wouldn't put it past big corporations to collude together as well. 


After all, we all know it's illegal, yet there are always instances of it happening. I definitely do think there is a lot of misinformation - or lack off - surrounding this entire situation, and I could definitely be wrong in thinking that net neutrality should be preserved, but your opinion has definitely opened my eyes even more on the matter.

TL;DR: I still support net neutrality, but above post has raised some very good points about why it won't be the end of the internet as we know it.
$C: Can't get shredded by the opposition when there is no opposition *taps head*

But not entirely sure of your PoV. Do you support net neutrality, but believe it is not that important?
$C: A large number of households in the U.S. only have access to one option for broadband internet. Because of the high barrier of entry for an ISP, it is often cheaper for an ISP to not invest capital in places where competitors have already invested. Consumers won't be able to choose another option because no other option will be available to them. Furthermore, by charging websites for priority access to consumers instead of directly charging consumers, an ISP will be able to obscure any non-competitive behavior. While larger websites will be able to afford priority access, smaller websites will not be able to afford the same access which will inhibit the growth of new web services.
$C: yes it is regulation that kept ISPs from regulating.  
$C: true but you knew the spirit of the comment that the regulations that the corporate schills will place on us need to be removed for they are coming
$C: Much obliged 
$C: only 19 states have laws on the books.....
$C: don't cherry pick the wikipedia article ... two lines down "Google has since supported net neutrality.[174]"
$C: Straight into the trash folder!
$C: As long as he glimpses the thousands of subject lines all calling him a piece of shit, it'll be worth it.
$C: So if I write in the subject that I might be a lawyer he's gonna read me calling him a piece of shit?

Be right back
$C: We tried and this didn't change much to be really honest. I mean lets be real, what's actually next on the books? March down on the street with banners? Wear black ribbons on our arms for a day? Hold a nationwide protest? Keep writing emails and calling? Vote more responsibly next time? ACTUALLY GO OUT AND VOTE NEXT TIME? 
$C: The bots doing his best okay?
$C: [deleted]
$C: what if we had Pai's personal address?
$C: Considering there is huge support for net neutrality on both sides, this vote might be a death sentence for some republican reps.

$C: I know it’s funny to just lay blame on them but 2/5 votes against repealing the laws. You should be sending Mignon Clyburn and Jessica Rosenworcel  supportive emails. Both democratic and were at the FCC when the rules were put in place
$C: It's better if you write organically. They try to ignore us already, but they extra ignore us if you send a form letter.

Just write your personal views. Why you support a free and open Internet, that you don't support companies buying their way into power with the FCC, and that true Net Neutrality should be mandatory.

I'm sure you can find a form letter somewhere, but it's best to personalise it from there.
$C: Also, what is with the blank first page with just my name on it, then to charge $2 for that page??? And I was sending to 4 people, so that is $8 spent on blank pages??? That is not good. Is this what happens when we lose Net Neutrality, we get charges for extra blank pages?

$C: You need some help dude. 
$C: Quite being melodramatic.  Violence worked in an age before militarized police.  Good fucking luck with that now.

$C: Pretty bot.
$C: Aren’t all three in the past been employed by the very corporations benefitting from this?
$C: Thanks for revealing yourself to be another POS Leftie who wants to censor opposing opinions, just like every other POS Leftie in Politics and News. 
$C: Except the ones who are for net neutrality are against a bunch of other shit people like, and then most of us are right back to square one just on different topics.

$C: Same here in Texas. I can just imagine Ted Cruz scrolling through his email and rubbing his scaly nipples while reading our concerns
$C: Same in Georgia. Fuck it. I'm done.

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: What about mercy?
$C: I don't really know much about the American political system, but surely other countries might start to take note of the fact that the US government are ***literally ignoring the concept of democracy whilst claiming to be a democracy*** and start to question it? Is there even anything like the EU for example could do to make America listen to their people for a fucking change?

If i were a leader of a world-leading country, I'd certainly publicly question why America are making decisions despite 90% of that country's population very publicly protesting it. This isn't just a reddit thing, the entire country has been up in arms, and every single person in the USA with some form of political power knows that no one likes this decision.
$C: There is definitely an overall near-constant theme of US representatives just completely ~~ignoring~~ *defying* the values of the majority of their constituents in favor of special interests. It's not a party-specific problem either. 

I would say something snarky like, "It's like they forget who keeps them employed." But let's be real, the almighty dollar probably got them in office in the first place and it seems to be doing just fine at keeping them there.
$C: > because look at the uproar this country made over net neutrality and look at the end result

Was there really that much uproar outside of Reddit?
I feel the majority of people still have no idea what net neutrality is or how if would effect them...
Maybe the problem is the saving net neutrality became too much of an echo chamber - we were discussing amongst ourselves when we should ave been discussing with everyone else
$C: In  the end we aren't really a democracy. 
$C: And replace them with new people to get paid off.
$C: It's not the old grey bastards in office. It's their hired guns - cops and military. Dismantle them, ostracize anyone who participates in those entities actions inside the country, make life dangerous for them and their families until they walk away from their "service" and our representatives will never be so eager to please us. 

They feel safe fucking us over because there's always 10000 people willing to shoot you for them right now. 
$C: Actually my ancestrial founding father's family escaped death and slavery at the hands of the British after the ill fated Battle of the Culloden in Scotland.  He is primarily the one that fought to have the amendment for our right to bear arms against a facist and oppressive government.
$C: There's no one to fucking run against them. And the districts are set up in such a way that they pretty much always go the same way because of the demographics in them. 
$C: We say this but new bastards will just get in every single time 
$C: Henceforth, I advise for us to crush the GOP, in the polls, the midterms and elsewhere.

Ensure they *never* hold power again. In any form or capacity.
$C: Pretty sure some democrats voted for this too.

$C: They won't listen.  We'll want to vote out the one who betrayed us all on NN, but the opponent will be worse, so we'll hold our noses and vote for the lesser evil.  Again.  They know this.
$C: That also accomplished nothing really. As a black man I've seen no change. 
$C: Lol. Not gonna work man. 
$C: I don't think you understand me man. 
$C: That answer makes no sense
$C: Shut up. 
$C: Agreed. I always go into political things with a sense of realism and not wishful delusional hope 
$C: >What is gonna change if you do not write?

Why attack something I'm clearly in no control over. 
$C: > It probably won't change any minds or help but it's a hell of a lot safer and more legal than the other way of changing corrupt politicians' minds. Better to try writing than end up dead or in jail.

$C: http://thehill.com/policy/technology/364528-poll-83-percent-of-voters-support-keeping-fccs-net-neutrality-rules

$C: That's nonsense. They never delivered a justified reason why title 2 can't be used for the internet, just some arbitrary claims saying it's outdated and vague fearmongering about government regulation.

If they don't regulate it as a title 2 utility, then the legal situation is even more outdated, because now companies can slow down block consumers access on a whim.

If you want the full picture, just look at the main argumemt from the FCC's side: It's gonna increase investment and competition. Again, there is no basis at all for that argument, if anything there are very easy to understand why a lack of NN removes competition (which is the literal reason why people want NN).
$C: Except they didn't require the FCC to repeal the NN regs for Congress to write a new law. 

If you actually, honestly think a Republican congress is going to create new NN laws, you are a delusional child.
$C: I'm pretty sure it's more to do with the fact that they're Democrats.
$C: There's a live stream on Facebook and you can see hundreds of angry reacts fly across the screen constantly. Wtf, how can almost complete unanimity in the public sphere be so absolutely ignored??
$C: This is how agencies work. Congress abdicated a lot of its day-to-day regulatory authority to agencies a long time ago. Agencies are controlled by the executive branch. The executive gets voted in and his policies are the one that carry the day. They don't need consensus. They don't need much of anything. They do what they're gonna do.

I understand that this is a debate where for a lot of people there are not two sides. But this type of quick-and-dirty rulemaking is how agencies always operate. It's why Obama was able to enact the regulations in the first place. He didn't go through Congress, he just used the FCC, and he, like Trump now, didn't need consensus or a vote from the people or Congress or anyone other than the people he picked to staff the agency. These regulations were a house of cards and they were swiped away as quickly as they were created. 

The FCC is the wrong target for your ire. The responsibility for legislation and enacting rules has always been with the legislative branch. That's their fucking job, and despite whatever it is you want to say, they are accountable. They need to be re-elected. And they are sitting on their hands right now just as they sat on their hands during Obama. 

Agencies just give Congress an excuse to ignore issues. They just say "well, let's let the FCC handle it." Some issues need to go beyond the agency and be put to an actual democratic vote, which in this country the best system we have found for doing so is through Congress. It doesn't work if the people don't hold the members of Congress accountable for their actions/inaction.

Basically, FCC gonna FCC. If you want something done well and done right you do not want to use a fucking agency that will be all-new people in four years to do it. This was always going to be the result of not getting actual legislation passed years ago.
$C: It's not quite that dramatic, though it seems like that on Reddit, which is predominantly young and largely tech-savvy. If you find older people who can maybe use a browser okay but don't really know what the internet *is* or how it works, and especially those who can barely send an email, and they probably have no idea what net neutrality means at all. Those who get a lot of news from sources like FOX have been repeatedly misinformed, usually along the lines that Net Neutrality is government 'interference' in the internet, and so would say they're against it.

This doesn't change the larger point, that informed citizens are decidedly against repealing NN, but we need to be careful about assuming the people we see around us represent everyone. Reddit isn't everyone. That said -- yeah, most people who know what's what are upset now, and Congress heard it from us, and they don't care (because they had corporate money stuffed in their ears).
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves. Violence was part of equal rights for Race and Gender. Violence stopped the Nazis and saved millions of lives. Violence created our Country and maintained it. It is a tool and in some situations it is the best tool for the job. This is one of those situations because all other avenues have been exhausted and the powers of the government themselves are being abused So there it is. There is the solution.     

I know you all won't listen and I know we will lose the internet because of it. I hope your ego and pretentious morality was worth us losing one the greatest wonders of the human world. My resentment is no longer just for the corrupt human garbage that pushed against Net Neutrality, but also now for all of you who allowed it to happen just because you didn't want to get dirty to clean up the filth.

$C: [deleted]
$C: People that think it is are stupid 
$C: Well yeah, it's not trying to be. 
$C: We had net neutrality under Democrats, and Republicans changed it. 

If you can't accurately assign blame, you can't start fixing the problem. 

Democrats have only controlled the government 4 years since 1981. (2 years in the window of that study; 1993-1994, when they did raise taxes on the rich) 
$C: good luck doing that with a Republican Congress
$C: Are you claiming that Trump's responsible for the loss of net neutrality, while simultaneously implying Clinton would be in favor of it?
$C: It's almost like, and I know this is crazy, the large percentage of voting Americans don't visit reddit multiple times a day =0
$C: Hey Ajit
$C: Imagine [this](https://i.imgur.com/9nu6jOm.png) except instead of HBO, ESPN and National Geographic, it's Youtube, Facebook and Steam.
$C: You can sign up for internet only. Buy your own equipment and you'll be paying >$40/mo for internet only. 
$C: Where can we go? My GF and I are seriously considering leaving if net neutrality is repealed. I feel like emigrating is more difficult than it should be, most countries seem to have strict immigration laws so any insight would be appreciated.
$C: Yea but the problem is that if alot of people do that, they'll leave the U.S. to rot and become a shithole instead of staying and fighting back. 
$C: That's what we thought about Youtube when Vidme was still around. I like seeing a fire under evil corporations too, but we're the only ones burning in it.

$C: He's saying his internet has sucked and will continue suck because for a long time now ISPs haven't had the desire or need to improve or innovate. This has nothing to due with regulation, but with the oligopoly that dominates the market. Now the ISPs get to charge him more for the shitty internet they provide still without making improvements or innovations.
$C: Yeah I see what you are confused about. I guess Net Neutrality didn't change anything for me at all regardless but I still want Net Neutrality enacted to hopefully help protect me and make others lives better. Edited it for clarification after I calmed from watching the FCC's vote. 
$C: Here's a neat article. There are not many on Anti-NetN, but I found this one somewhat profound : https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshsteimle/2014/05/14/am-i-the-only-techie-against-net-neutrality

$C: What did you do? 
$C: Curious...
$C: If you really believe this then get out from behind your keyboard and go throw a brick through a window you fucking hypocrite
$C: No, slaves were freed peacefully. Violence tried to keep them enslaved, and then more violence stopped that.
$C: Violence is a last resort and we're NOWHERE FUCKING NEAR needing it.

Seriously.

Also the right has all the guns, so that would end poorly if you tried doing something stupid anyway.
$C: Seriously, not only do I have Fios, but when house hunting, I made it absolutely clear that I was completely uninterested in any house that does not have access to it.  It works great, downtimes are extremely rare, and usually in off hours, and customer support has always been pretty quick.

Verizon is a lousy scumbag company, but at least their fiber optic network works well.
$C: Maybe it is then. My neighbors had it and said it was very slow and Verizon called it their FIOS. 
$C: Yeah but I don't think turtle man cares what I think.  
$C: Net Neutrality didn't change anything for me but I guess it stopped ATT form profiting more. 
$C: I may contact a service that isn't in my area but close by and ask them if they plan to expand. 
$C: Lol. Alright brb going to get a loan from the bank. 
$C: I am a developer for [savethenet.today](https://github.com/gu-app-club/save-the-net). We offered a similar service three weeks ago. When we found out that https://battleforthenet.com was able to subsidize the cost for sending letters we immediately disabled our service. We charged the absolute minimum of $1.50 for each letter. We used https://lob.com to send mail. I am not sure how I feel about a service like this becoming popular when there is an evidently free competing service... but I can't complain that people are taking initiative.

$C: Speaking of using technology to help... (forgive me, I'm more of a lurker than a poster, but this is important)

I feel it is important to raise awareness about [mesh networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_mesh_network) and the possibility of building a new Internet.  Mesh networks have been used in places like [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FireChat) to circumvent government firewalls and in disaster areas where infrastructure has been damaged.  Technology like this could be a solution, but it depends on people getting involved.

Further down, [/u/SushiSlander](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7jsyqt/the_fccs_vote_was_predictably_frustrating_but/dr9229p/) mentions hyperboria.net as a project working on this problem.  If there are other mature projects, spread the word!  I am hopeful that this will result in more robust and accessible networks, it just may take some time.

thanks.
$C: Hello, this is the owner of MailMyGov. First of all thanks to u/spez ... the bot is positively beaming :) I think it deserves the weekend off.


Also wanted to address a couple of the comments. Yes places like battleforthenet.com are awesome and amazing and you should use them. So are all the other links in the bot post.


But afaik, they don't let you send a real letter. Our letters are printed out and mailed in house (a deliberate decision for security and privacy) in NYC. Every letter is double-checked to be sure everything is printed, enveloped, stamped and sealed properly. A real human does all of this, and a real human goes to the post office every morning and drops them off. All of this does mean that it's a bit more expensive to get this all done, not to mention server costs and the overhead.


Hope this helps, and regardless, the everyone should try their best to organize, inform, advocate and VOTE and we hope MailMyGov can help in some of that.


Cheers! (any feedback is always welcome)

$C: I don't suppose if they bring about 'premium' net packages you would have any say in making Reddit part of every plan, would you?

$C: good spez
$C: Where was anonymous when we needed them
$C: Would it not be beneficial for everyone to reach out to their state level governments as well. I don’t see why the individual states wouldn’t be able to put something in place to preserve net neutrality. Or is this solely a federal concern? 
$C: What? It says I have to spend 10 FCCredits to read your post

$C: What?
$C: You are kind of a bot, aren't you?
$C: maybe, just maybe, "Net Neutrality" should have been rebranded as "Internet Equality" which is something much simpler to understand and that many people could easily get behind while still representing the same idea as net neutrality.  

Unlike the devious "Internet Freedom" moniker that repeallers use which is likely to sway many uninformed people and is an absolutely dishonest term to use to represent the issue. 
$C: Are you going to do anything about the rampant racism on this site or do you not care because you make a lot of money and your only speaking up now because this effects your bank account. Weak and cowardly
$C: When someone posts direct hyperlinks in T_D, they are shadowbanned, but this is a 'good bot' - Why is that?
$C: If you care so much about free speech, support it also on reddit. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: why is it this hard to talk to our fucking "representatives" this is all bullshit, and you guys need to consider whats really going on, the bigger picture.
$C: Will you delete r/Imgoingtohellforthis for spoiling star wars 8?
$C: Will you edit other user's comments that are against NN so that it will show 100% support?
$C: /u/spez, for someone and his admins that silence conservatives on here so much, [like Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch just the other day](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7jlicg/unbelievable_tom_fitton_is_silenced_in_his_own/), your double standards could not be more clear. You want the net to be neutral, but you can't keep your own damn platform neutral, and everyone knows it. Including your friends at Shareblue.
$C: good ceo
$C: Good gold giver
$C: two golds for that

$C: Facebook, google and Reddit support Net Neutrality because it keeps them at the top and their monopolies strong. 

You push for net neutrality and then censor politics you disagree with. Pretty ironic.

$C: Why do you promote neutrality for the internet when you wont even do it for your own site? Hypocrite.
$C: Fuck u/spez and net neutrality
$C: I'm a toomey constituent too, and have experienced his entire office being conveniently shut down and unavailable for calls during times of controversial legislation. Who votes for these people. 
$C: Looking at you Greg Walden. Staffers in his La Grande office literally hid from activists for net neutrality last week. Closed and locked the front door, slapped a sign on it saying they were off site, and could be seen in the back halls of the office. 
$C: ^ THIS. YOU DO NOT NEED TO GET UP AND FIND YOUR CREDIT CARD TO HAVE THE SAME IMPACT. SEND AN EMAIL. 

I am a legislative correspondent for a democratic senator, which means that most of my job is to write responses to letters from constituents. In our mail system, (every office has their own, but most are pretty similar and mine is pretty typical) incoming mail is sorted on arrival by issue area such as healthcare, gun control, communications (net neutrality), etc. If you send physical mail, not only will it get held for a week or two, but it gets scanned and put into the same software as all the emails. That software uses text matching technology to decide if your letter is a form letter that's part of a campaign and can thus be responded to by a form letter. 

If your letter is part of a big campaign, you'll probably get a pretty speedy response, because people like me feel good about themselves when they have a backlog of 15,000 letters and can respond to 4,000 of them all at once. If you write your own letter, I will enjoy reading it much more, but that'll be months from now.

Regardless of when you get your response, the thing that matters in terms of shaping policy in real time is just the number of communications we receive on a given issue in a given week. We keep tallies of the letters coming in (just the total), as well as the phone calls (for and against). Those numbers get reported in our (me and the other LCs) weekly mail meeting with the legislative director, and at our weekly staff meeting, where the cheif of staff is present. They take that information to the Senator in a less detailed form -- "Hey, we got a bazillion letters slamming you on net neutrality this week, that position might be a liability come November"-- and the Senator makes his decision accordingly. 

Hope this helps explain how mail works in congressional offices. House offices work through more or less the same process, but with a smaller staff and a shorter chain of command.

Edit: diction, it's worth going back for
$C: It’s like 10 cents to actually mail your own damn letter.  They’re doing it for you of course it’ll be $2
$C: Plus, physical letters get scanned and are treated just the same as email.  This is a business, not activism.
$C: Was going to say, that's just a blatant ad.
$C: Much Respect!
$C: there can’t just be a “second” internet. I think you’re underestimating the costs and difficulty it would be to build and boot up an entirely new network infrastructure.
$C: A single letter stamp is $.47. Paper, toner, envelopes, and people to do the mailing certainly aren't free. At best they'd pocket a few cents for each submission. 
$C: I'm in my forties, and I have a classmate from college who already left, about 15 years ago, mainly because the issues you mention were already existing then.
$C: Lmao we don’t wanna take care of your sorry ass why would another country do it?
$C: Serve us justice my good friend
$C: [deleted]
$C: Agreed. They won't listen to words, but if a couple FCC officials got their houses burnt down maybe they'd listen. Fuck 'em.

$C: They do not! I work for one doing exactly this, responding to letters, and although you wont always get a timely or personalized response, your letter is put in a tally, and that tally, both for and against an issue, is communicated to the (in my case) senator. Of course, legislators are not always swayed by mail, and there are good reasons why they shouldn't, but trust me, legislators fear their constituents, and calling and writing letters is the best way for ordinary people to make their representatives afraid to defy them.

$C: Dont give up! I write those responses for a Senator. For even the most hands-on senator, the odds that he will read your letter are zero, because they all have people like me do that for them. Regardless of the response you get, or even if you get one, the information that is passed on to the senator is the volume of mail on a given issue and the pro/con distribution of that mail, not the content of the letters per se. So keep sending! And call often! It all gets counted.

$C: The vast majority of the country do not have a clue what net neutrality is 
$C: That's not a haiku.
$C: Yeah It was fucking garbage back then
$C: What are you implying? The internet was created for the military. 
$C: You mean the one from Star Wars, right?
$C: Yeah, this is not okay.  Civil political discourse is appropriate and encouraged by the First Amendment.  Threatening someone's safety because you don't agree with their political views is not.
$C: Fixed.
$C: People seem to forget that NN was set up to have this decision in the hands of the FCC. 
$C: Here's what I say about communism, though: 


"Don't feed the bears, or they'll become weak and unable to help themselves"



"Like welfare and communism?"
$C: And immediately glosses over the "few cases" where it's actually happened and been slapped down BECAUSE OF Net Neutrality.

God damn, these guys are such shills.
$C: "We only MIGHT fuck you guys over. It's all hypothetical and, therefore, invalid"
$C: What really gets me is he's saying the things we've been saying **will** happen without nn are "maybes" despite actual evidence it happened before, but ISPs that are already essentially monopolies in many places will DEFINITELY innovate. 

Why would they innovate if they don't have to? without nn, they didn't innovate. why would they do so now?

My stomach turned at the patronising way he presented his fallacies. 
$C: Well up until today they have been. 
$C: Seriously, it's insanely hard to get by in the modern day without internet, and downright impossible without a phone, and most people have no real choice of provider
$C: Hence the smugness of Ajit Pai. He knows it's a win for his Verizon masters because what are we going to do about it.
$C: Am seriously considering it. I've gone without before. It'd suck, but I'm too poor to pay more, anyway. Might as well rip off the bandage quick.
$C: Unfortunately, it's a catch 22. If the FCC repeal net neutrality and the ISP decide to change how you access the internet what are you going to do? Most areas have very few choices for providers. You could cancel your plan but then no internet because there is no other company to goto. So really we just have to suck it up. The ISPs cant lose with this vote.  
$C: Depending on the service, there may not be one. I know services like dish will force you into contracts, but I have charter (re: shit) and they build their tag line around not having a contract, as if that makes them super great. Yeah. Super great. Cause they’re literally the only viable choice here if I want anything with useable speeds ... 
$C: Don't forget right before the tax bill too. They want people distracted as they ram this down our throats.
$C: "They" means the members of the FCC panel. You and I don't get a choice.

While your here though I have a question, why do you oppose Net Neutrality?
$C: And those services are likely to become less usable now, unless they pay to play or are owned by your ISP. 
$C: This all happened because you didn't pay for winrar.
$C: They'll throttle or disable all unofficial torrent traffic. It's very easy to detect and cancel.
$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMhfbLRoGEw
$C: They're returning to the room right now. All seems okay.
$C: I think Russia threw in its hat for a third Oligarch status over the past few years. A nation as an oligarch in another nation. This sounds familiar. 
$C: No, I'm aware... I'm just bitching because it's all I can do at the moment.
$C: Yeah high barriers to entry will make it hard for anything to happen soon, but I think there can be hope for the mid-distant future that is influenced by this event
$C: Yeah heard about this. Really fucked up.
$C: But hes a businessman, a man of the people, certainly this person who has only ever lived the extremely lavish life will look out for the very people he's stepped on all his life!
$C: So apparently you're not aware of how the FCC works. 

By statute, the FCC is required to have 2 Republicans and 2 Democrats, and the president gets full control over who to choose as chair. Because of this, whenever a Republican retires when a Democrat is in charge, the Senate chooses who gets to replace the Republican. Ajit Pai was chosen by Mitch McConnell. 

Yes, Obama "appointed" Pai, because he is the only one with the power to appoint executive positions. But he was required by statute to appoint the person the Republicans chose. 

So, now that you're aware of how it works, please don't spread this oversimplification that misinforms people anymore. 
$C: Mitch O'Connell told Trump to promote him to chairperson and he did. All 3 are hardcore conservatives.

This is all on the GOP forever. Nice try tho /r/The_donald shitter
$C: Obama appointed this guy at the advice of Mitch McConnell. It's all public. 
$C: Yeah, I'm done with the 'both sides do this' bullshit. 
$C: Good

It is a great thing and Trump is Making America Great !!!
$C: Not *exclusively.* There were, and continue to be, those on the political left (Susan Sarandon among the most prominent) who claim(ed) that Hillary Clinton would be “no different”—or mind-bogglingly, then and now, *worse* —than Donald Trump, and urged others to vote for Jill “Not a Chance in Hell of Winning” Stein or stay home or write in Bernie Sanders *et al ad infinitum.*

It was dead wrong as a hypothetical then, and this vote today shows how obscenely wrong it is now.  Along with the impending tax windfall for the rich travesty; Trump’s shrinking of national monuments; Trump’s self-denial of Russian interference in the 2016 election and cozying up to Vlad Putin; Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement; and the Trump-inspired “normalization” of white supremacy that led to tragic results in Charlottesville, Virginia, to name a very few. **None of these things would have occurred under a President Hillary Clinton.**
$C: how about all of those things
$C: laws are for the plebs.
$C: THE USER ABOVE IS A MOD AT r/nonetneutrality, and has spammed this message over 40 times pretending to be for net neutrality and violent, presumably because they lead an incredibly sad life, or are paid (redditor for 2 months, random subs, and a mod?). Report, and be aware that these people exist.
$C: That doesn’t justify whatsoever Ajit Pai’s actions, whether or not ‘violence’ stopped the Nazi’s or not. 
$C: You’ll be on the front lines I’m guessing right?
$C: He lied through his teeth and liked it.

Then has the audacity to talk about how net neutrality is killing "new markets" which is COMPLETE bullshit.
$C: Don't be a troll
$C: Is healthcare, housing and proper internet commodities or a human right in the twenty first century? 

There's your answer. 
$C:  Most republicans are educated, and yes, republicans prefer the status quo, but just because some republicans are traditionalists doesn't mean they are uneducated. And not all republicans just want to help benefit the wealthy. You people are just too influenced by mainstream media when they speak about these topics. The worst republicans get the most attention and then the liberal media takes hold of that and says those republicans whom are the worst, are basically what all republicans are like, and that is not true. Take for example, Donald Trump, probably the most famous (or should I say infamous) Republican known currently. He gets all the attention despite being one of the worst representations of the Republican party, and then mainstream media constantly reports about him, people notice all the bad things he's done and then some people instantly assume most or all Republicans are like that. 

Sorry, rant over, I just want to get it all out. I just want you all to know that not all Republicans are  as bad as one would think. And this is coming from a conservative/Republican for Net Neutrality. By the way, shouldn't this just be a united issue? Why can't all just fight together? We're currently too divided about these issues to make a big change. 
$C: Two commissioners have to be from the minority party.
$C: How does it feel being so cucked you'll support the whims of a business who wants to screw you out of your money at every opportunity?
$C: Well, I mean, at one point they amended shit to basically block the public's right to choose to drink alcohol socially/recreationally. And then they amended to overturn that.

They're not above amendments to effect less pressing matters.
$C: >amendment forcing internet service providers to conform to the regulations and restrictions set forth by the oh-so-holy government.

Do you not realise the big picture here? Yes, NN puts restrictions and regulations on a few ISPs. However, as a result this prevents restrictions and regulations on the thousands upon thousands (millions?) of Internet based businesses and websites.

NN adds restrictions on a **few** ISPs to *prevent* restrictions on **many** Internet businesses. Without NN, ISPs have a legal right to favour certain websites over others, thus reducing fair and open competition from other websites.

If you actually cared about the free market, you'd support NN so that internet based businesses can freely compete in the internet market. Repealing NN is effectively excessive government control of the internet, except the "government" in question are the large ISPs. And as any libertarian will tell you, excessive government control is not good for the economy. They will also tell you that monopolies hurt the free market. NN helps prevent these ISP monopolies from interfering with internet based market.

I'm not entirely pro-libertarian, but I lean towards it. So may I remind you, assuming you are fiscally libertarian, that libertarianism calls for SMALL government, not NO government. Libertarians aren't Ancaps. If a regulation actually protects the free market in the large scheme of things, then it should be supported. I feel like many libertarians have their heart in the right place where the recognise tyranny of the government, but seem to somehow forget that large corporations with too much power are just as bad as large government. Just as people use laws to place check and balances on government, people should use some laws to place checks and balances on unfair monopolies if there is a risk of them preventing competition and hurting the free market.

Take this simplistic example: Without NN, ISPs can force Netflix to pay money for faster access to the service. This raises prices for Netflix's service, which goes against the whole "magic" of the free market. Another example: ISPs favour Netflix instead. So when a competitor to Netflix wants to enter the market, they will face unfair restrictions from ISPs due to being in direct competition with Netflix.

[There is a point that regulations have led to ISP monopolies in the first place, but I find that debatable since one can also argue that ISPs are natural monopolies due to high barriers of entry.]

Any corrections to my points are obviously more than welcome.




$C: Access to the internet, was declared a Human Right by the UN... 13 years ago

America is going in reverse 
$C: It's not far enough. The right to assembly is in the constitution but they're attacking that too. 
$C: Why? The internet is a necessity nowadays. Why should it not be upheld in the document that governs our land?
$C: It would fit nicely under free speech.

While we're in there doing surgery, maybe we can extract that part that allows money to equal free speech too.
$C: [deleted]
$C: how can we fight if they take away and nerf our means of doing so?
$C: yep, fuck em. I have a business selling products I make on amazon. I tried for 4 years to successfully make money online, in the last six months im finally successful. If they take that away from me I'll get rid of my smartphone and all internet access and start selling my products at farmers markets and craft fairs. Honestly that would probably be a more interesting life anyways, interacting with people instead of staring at a screen. Those fucking corrupt cucks wont stop me.
$C: Thank you. You're right. Where there is life there is hope. I needed to hear that right now. 
$C: IMO as long as capitalism is our primary form of running things hope does not exist. Greed will always win out and capitalism allows corporations to exploit the greed of people. If we ever truly want to get out of this hellhole that is created by corporations we have to get rid of the problem, capitalism, and that is something a majority of humanity is not ready for.
$C: Hope has its limit. This would be close to that limit for people doing well in life. I and others are not doing well. I can barely keep fucking going.
$C: I stopped thinking the government was any good a solid 20 years ago, as a teenager. I don't think it's been any good for a long time. Even before I was born there were people like Nixon, and before him Woodrow Wilson, and that was like a hundred years ago. 

It's always been bad, it just depends on how aware you are of it and your social class if you can complain or not. 
$C: The government was bought and paid for a long time ago.
$C: > I miss the days when I thought the government was a force for good.

How could anyone but a child believe that?
$C: If the state is bad and big business is bad, sounds like the only solution is a society without state or class. I wonder what you'd call that...
$C: Government has never been a force for good
$C: You can do both, by the way...
$C: Hopefully we start seeing more mass shootings targeting congressmen instead of innocent people

$C: I think they're very aware of what they're doing, and I honestly think it makes them feel great. 
$C: I agree with this statement...too bad power corrupts people.
$C: Well I wish folks like you would open your eyes and see that those in power already do see the suffering.

They don't fucking care.

$C: My gf is in a divided house as well and has cut off many people in her family for this very reason.  She is EXTREMELY vocal about how much she despises people who voted Republican, and she does not exempt her family for this.

Fortunately, there is no such division in my family.
$C: Were you voting for a crook, or a corpse? Or Johnson? Because, the crook should be  legally unable to ever hold government office again. The corpse is obsessed with a form of economy that has been proven to fail consistently, and Johnson was just poorly executed. Pandering gets you a long way, as you can see.
$C: Because of sentiments like this, Russia won. 
$C: The only change so far is the mandate being removed and that hasn't even been signed into law yet. Senate and House are still resolving.

$C: My premiums will be triple next year. I don't know for sure who's fault that is but I can blame Trump and the Republican majority and be confident they've tried to fuck me over. 
$C: yep and the rest of what he says has nothing to do with trump or he's misinformed

$C: That landed at the perfect time for me, it was a crazy miracle. I didn’t have health insurance the entire year went to do my taxes and did not have to declare that, saved me so much.

>Your taxes aren't going up unless your extremely rich

Yeah, that sorta true. But they're removing so many itemized deductions available that whatever hundreds of dollars he might be saving in taxes, will probably be spent in taxes on things he can no longer deduct. (e.g. work-related moves, or teachers buying classroom supplies).

>Also, last I checked Obamacare hasn’t been replaced or repealed. 

No, but because states aren't forced to opt in to expanded medicare medicare, and Trump has actually halted health care subsidies, as well as the general uncertainty regarded the health care market atm, premiums are being driven up higher than they would've been under the ACA. (Before the ACA, the premium increases were actually larger than in the first few years of the ACA)
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves. Violence was part of equal rights for Race and Gender. Violence stopped the Nazis and saved millions of lives. Violence created our Country and maintained it. It is a tool and in some situations it is the best tool for the job. This is one of those situations because all other avenues have been exhausted and the powers of the government themselves are being abused So there it is. There is the solution.     

I know you all won't listen and I know we will lose the internet because of it. I hope your ego and pretentious morality was worth us losing one the greatest wonders of the human world. My resentment is no longer just for the corrupt human garbage that pushed against Net Neutrality, but also now for all of you who allowed it to happen just because you didn't want to get dirty to clean up the filth.

$C: Elon Musk. This is where you become a hero.
$C: From what I understand about the satellites, they will be good at providing connections in low population areas, oceans, mountains, deserts etc, but in big cities there would be so much traffic it would be very slow. But, this may make us all move to the country, which might be nice. 
$C: Google gave up on that notion... Fiber is dying and they would rather piggyback with Sonic and other providers to bring a wifi solution, but even that is half assed.

Please learn the distinction between "the internet" (a series of connected networks that allow machines to talk to one another) and "the world wide web" (a collection of HTTP-based services on the internet accessed with a web browser).

In fact, you can probably go ahead and prepare to say goodbye to all those sorts of services now.  And every torrent site you've ever been to.  That has all changed, as of today.
$C: Haha yeah. That's my general voting rule lol. 
$C: Yeah and it's ridiculous that his supporters are pissed about this, it's like it didn't matter to them until it was shoved down their throats.

I'm just saying that despite whatever bs everyone brings up about "oh hillary is russia but wait trump is russia obama is muslim but he was born here but he wasn't born here bernie is socialism which is basically fascism and ***muh alex jones speculation***" that's mostly just a political dick measuring contest to argue that their candidate is absolutely 100% god. But this vote is just an absolute buyout of our government officials for them to go against our demands as a country.
$C: > Trump said he'd do this. People voted for him anyway. They decided it was less important than "build the wall" or "triggered libs" or whatthefuckever.

No he didn't. He didn't talk about it once. The only quote anyone could find on trump and his views were way back in 2014. It was not a promise he made during the election.
https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/12/trump-net-neutrality-mystery/509564/
$C: Okay, there's the small minority that wants it. But I saw some sort of percentage (I think 83%) that were against the repeal. That'd be like if 83% of the entire country voted hillary and the electoral college was like lolnah u just got TRUMP'D 
$C: Don't give them money. Fire them. Vote for someone else.
$C: Violence and threats of violence over politics is just plain wrong. Fight by going to the polls and voting.
$C: > The thing is, it doesn't even matter. This was decided when Trump was voted in, no amount of protesting would have any effect.

Sure it does.  FCC policy isn't set in stone.  Agencies are granted some regulatory power by Congress so that Congress doesn't need to deliberate everything.  But, if people get fired up about something, that indicates the agency isn't effectively managing the issue.

Congress may be forced to step in.  This is, after all, about the first amendment, which traditionally has superseded any other issue in America.

If there's anything we agree on, it's that we believe in free speech.

$C: Totally agree. I cannot suffer idiots who think they make Plato look like Rob Schneider.
$C: And I think we need to remember these asshole politicians don't fall out of the sky or get summoned in some blood ritual (not sure about McConnell though, he seems otherworldly.) They were raised in American neighborhoods, by American parents, went to American schools, and were taught by American professors. This is the best we can do, these monsters are our nation's product and they will keep becoming worse and worse until we fundamentally change our values, specifically in regard to money.
$C: Very, very much so.
$C: What are you on about man? You’re not making any sense.
$C: Swatting the FCC lol. Yeah its back on now, __aShit Pie__ is whining through the rest of his speech. 
$C: > King dipshit

Piece Ajit
$C: No..lol. It was a 5 person committee. How are you going to make an opinion on something but know nothing about it. 
$C: The majority Americans openly disagreed with the repeal and they fucked us all anyways. 

Insinuating that violence isn’t an answer ignores thousands of years of human history where violence was the only answer to blatant oppression. 
$C: For the nation, I meant. 
$C: Because of the FCC's 3-2 rule, and Pai was one of the GOP's two recommendations.

Obama's 3 Dems, including the then chairman, defended NN.
$C: Obama put in pro-NN rules, and the two Democrats in the FCC voted against repeal.
$C: Tell me all about how the overwhelming extent to which it's partisan in DC is AKSHUALLY a lie.
$C: Don't destroy the cities. Destroy the FCC building, the white house, court houses, and any other government buildings.
$C: The LA Riots of '92 were caused as a result of one man being beaten by police. A riot can happen from anything, even from the FCC's decision to disrupt the largest form of communication in America.
$C: Well, at least they might listen to the people. My favorite quote is "Power should be given to those who dont want it" just because they are the ones who best handle it.
$C: THE USER ABOVE IS A MOD AT r/nonetneutrality, and has spammed this message over 40 times pretending to be for net neutrality and violent, presumably because they lead an incredibly sad life, or are paid (redditor for 2 months, random subs, and a mod?). Report, and be aware that these people exist.
$C: The problem I have with this regulation is that it sets a precedent for the rest of the world, and impacts the rest of the world because a significant portion of the internet relies on US infrastructure. With that in mind, I consider this a form of bias, which in my opinion should force the FCC to submit any such proposal to an international panel. 
$C: That's my point, this is inevitable in my opinion.
$C: You do realize that NN was a government RESTRICTION on ISPs.

Im not taking either side, but to say that ending NN goes against your freedom is naive. 

$C: This wasn't even a complete thought. Are YOU dumb?
$C: Guessing you can't read. Take a quick peak at who took money to make this happen and get back to me.
$C: Never, good luck shooting down tanks and drones.
$C: The last thing leftists need is to be seen yet again as the violent scum they are. Better hope for your sake you all find a bit of self control before the military puts you down like rabid dogs
$C: Overthrowing the govt because of a minor change to the internet? You need to go outside more.
$C: Been in Australia for over 20 yrs. I assure you it already has.
$C: "What if I told you..."

"The FCC is required by law to be staffed by no more than 3 people of the same party, so there's always going to be shitty Republicans on it"....

hmmmmmmmm
$C: Obama was forced to appoint 2 Republicans by law. There's a reason why the original vote to implement Title II Net Neutrality was 3-2, all the democrats voted in favor and the Republicans against.
$C: Yes, how racist of me when no mention of race was made whatsoever; find a dictionary.
$C: Well at least it submits your comment before it cuts you off. 
$C: If only there were a choice for customers in most cases...
$C: We don’t need to worry, as the federal government won’t let ISPs pull the same shit as their American Counterparts. Trudeau supports Net Neutrality and our political system is nowhere near as dysfunctional as the states.
$C: They may be more expensive here in Canada but at least, when you buy a connection to Internet, you have all the sites.
$C: really cause Shaw 150 internet as in 150 down /15 up and unlimited transfer is 90$'s a month if you agree to a 2 year deal. That deal though never enforced, change it to whatever as long as you stay a customer with no penalties. Don't know who your provider is but you may wanna start shopping around.  And our internet isn't throttled or blocked, what your seeing is slow down when connecting to certain ISPS in the states nodes. Back when they were shaking Netflix down, I did a quick search online for Verizon and comcast IP ranges found them went into my router's software and set up filtering to not connect to those ranges. Suddenly web got a fuckton faster cause I wasn't using their bottlenecked nodes.
$C: ISP’s can throttle your app if they want. And your apps performance will be impacted by ISPs providing shitty slow internet to people who pay less. Ask any one in tech and they will agree that this move only damages the American tech industry as a whole. 
$C: The way I see it, NN provisions disallow ISPs from (1) prioritising paid-for traffic and (2) censoring arbitrary content.

The repeal of these provisions will stifle growth in the startup sector tremendously -- tech startups are usually short of money as it already is, and making them pay a premium just to be relevant is plain atrocious.

As far as the argument of a 'free market' existing before the Obama administration goes, I hope you realise that ISPs were just beginning to gather enough clout to begin charging premiums.

In an ideal world, the concept of a free market goes a long way -- but it means nothing if ISPs already have huge monopolies and are able to swat out any existing competitors.
$C: Where has the tenacity of the people went? The future of the children is laden with debt, no affordable health care, horrible education, and not to mention the wages and the taxes. We cannot allow this. As Jefferson has said before " The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure". People will get killed no doubt about that and innocents will be killed in the process, but we cannot allow our future generations be enslaved to the elite.
$C: I am just sick right now!  Of course, when I look at who voted to repeal they all had an R by their names.  No ethics at all!!!
$C: Lol...no...I like my uneventful life 
$C: Well that is why I said civilly disobedient. But people need to be out in the streets. And it needs to be large, and it needs to be on a regular basis. 
$C: That might be what is needed. There is also going to be a lot of push back from the cable companies. It can be done. It was years before DirecTV could start offering their service in my town. Cablevision fought hard against it. So it does come down to capital, but it will also come down to having the right people in office in your local municipalities. 
$C: What part of his comment was racist? 
$C: They mentioned nothing about  race. Fuck pai I wish him the worst in life
$C: It's entirely about his vote and the policy he just forced through. Fuck Pai.
$C: The exact quote was a “conservative leaning moderate”, which is what I am. I’m pro-life, pro second but not enslaved to an institution where I’m not able to think for myself. Keep drinking the koolaid, you are just as brainwashed by your talking points as the liberals you despise. 
$C: Are you this salty that your life long NY liberal president hijacked your party pretending to be a conservative?
$C: Lol oh yea, all my posts on R/Eagles certainly paint the entirety of my humanity. 👍🏻
$C: So if they all vote for repeal, it still wont be decided today?
$C: 2-2 now....
$C: As opposed to the current net neutrality rules that benefit the other corporations?
$C: Just like they own water... You want to filter rain water? Get your door kicked in by a government agency bitch.
$C: how about you suck a fat nut, ya nay saying sheep
$C: Hopefully it delays it so Congress can override the fcc
$C: Even if they did sue, would be stuck in court for years not to mention would have Verizon's army of lawyers backing them
$C: I can either choose between AT&T and Comcast. AT&T is shit so I really have no choice but to use Comcast. Maybe AT&T can finally improve now to get my business. 
$C: Exactly. This battle for Net Neutrality is starting to turn towards the idea of corrupt Politicians and our failure of a "democracy". This is gonna be an interesting next couple of years. 

Luckily at least 2 Attorney Generals plan on suing the FCC which means this could go to the SCOTUS ending in the possibility of a new amendment/federal law based on the Internet 
$C: Because the FCC is supposed to be bipartisan. It has to consist of two of the opposing party and three of the other party (hence why the two Democratic commissioners voted against the repeal). Pai was McConnell's pick.
$C: He lost. By not much. I kind of expect more of the people of America.
$C: Stop :-( next thing up is swipe to wipe! This country is going down the tubes. 
$C: We’re already getting ass blasted I doubt they can blast us much more tbh
$C: Call me nuts or paranoid but i've got terabytes of media I've been downloading over the past year. Do it now while you can! 
$C: I'm just gonna masturbate a lot. 
$C: Yeah but internet fast lanes is a real thing. And to think they wouldn't capitalize on being able to chop up their service is a little ridiculous imo. 
$C: But I assure you, my fees have NEVER been STRONGER!!

$C: Yes, as a commissioner. This was at the recommendation of Sen. McConnell. Per the FCC rules, only three members of the same political party are allowed. This is why there will always be a 3-2 vote if it’s straight down the party line. 
$C: Yeah, Donald Trump was just so damn great /s

$C: Out of pure curiosity what do the politicians in Brazil do as one who is uneducated politics of the world
$C: Bullshit, Hillary is for net neutrality.  https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/technology-and-innovation/
$C: I went to Bernie Sanders rally and what he was stressing is that if it was trump versus Hillary Trump would win but if it was trump versus Bernie Bernie would win because it would not be about who is more evil witch this whole election was about for the primaries
$C: Obama had to appoint two Republicans because only three of the five can be from one party. Ajit Pai was Mitch McConnel’s choice. 

That's also why Trump kept two Democrats (pro-net neutrality) in the FCC. It's just that now they are outnumbered.
$C: Lol what? Omg that's crazy, dumbass posting something on Twitter. Thanks for finding this btw.
$C: Lol no. Never understood a bomb threat anyways. If you want to bomb someone why the hell would you tell them. 
$C: Most liberals support 2nd amendments but fill there should be some more restrictions. So nope good try. Lol sorry not trying to be a dick. Just been fending of so many people from the d_ I mistook your comment lol. 
$C: I doubt it 
$C: He made a lot of Freudian slips. He knows this is stupid, but he's too stupid to even think about it.
$C: We can hope 
$C: thats the only part that im gonna do too. I cant go back to skin mags now
$C: I can't afford more hard drive space so I'm furiously wanking from now until they remove my porns. 
$C: I need to draw my own shit. Even if I can’t post them I will enjoy them myself
$C: I agree... This is like a doomsday prepper post. The worst case scenario as described in this post won't happen, if for nothing else, mega corporations like Google and Amazon won't let it... Google's entire business model depends upon an open internet. They will do what they have to to ensure that the internet remains as close to as it is today, whether it's buying out ISPs and putting others out of business with a service that keeps it similar to what we currently have.

Of course, that would come with its own issues with Google owning basically the whole kit-and-kaboodle... Would probably try to ice out competitors like Amazon and Apple, push their own products like they already do... Might end up with Google/Amazon/Apple owning the internet. Like the modern day equivalent of AOL vs. Prodigy vs. Compuserve
$C: I thinks its a sketch of what's happening on Reddit.
$C: He is being "dramatic" but I think this advice will be truthful in few years time.

Politicians wont take everything away tomorrow, but gradually, making small changes and forcing people to settle and accept changes and then impose more.

Slowly and surely they will herd us as they please. 
$C: Some of it isn't bad advice, though. Namely backing up and pirating things. I use a lot of torrent sites and unauthorized streaming services and realistically I know those will be the first to go. VPN is always a good idea, too.
$C: Yeah, I agree with 2 (just for the personal info), 8, 9, 10 without the hyperbole but buying up hard drives and trying to download websites, porn, etc.. what lol. 
$C: It will. There's still hope if you realize we are past the possibility of any peaceful means working.
$C: All of what he said won't happen overnight, but eventually. After a time, the internet as we know it will mostly get phased out, maybe about 3-5% of what we can now typically access will even still be around.
$C: Gotta download the cars before you download the websites
$C: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download

https://torrentfreak.com/download-a-copy-of-the-pirate-bay-its-only-90-mb-120209/

$C: Even faster than that. We have 2 main checks against it as well.

Congress- Theres a repeal act put in place that lets congress vote against a decision made by a federal agency. 60 Day time period, but congress is well aware of the issue and this will most likely make it through.

The Courts- This is for sure going to the courts, and the Washington DC district court, the one in charge of this. Is a liberal court, so this will be stuck in the court hell there for awhile.

And to add onto that, Democrats are starting to take back Congress. This allows the passing of Laws against net neutrality. With how big of an upset this was you can bet your ass people are going to be wanting a guaranteed protection against it. Like you said, people we need to take a few breaths calm down and plan ahead. 
$C: > Can Americans stop thinking they're the be all and end all of the fucking universe? 

The internet depends on the US a lot. If american ISPs decide to make free internet a thing for the rich 0,1%, it will affect everybody. 
$C: We didn't elect him, he was put there. We don't have anymore say over this bill passing, than we do over who gets in office.  We're just along for the ride, and try to enjoy the Pros of America vs the Cons as best we can.
$C: > Can Americans stop thinking they're the be all and end all of the fucking universe?

What I love is how they ignore all the other countries on earth that don't have any kind of net neutrality - like, for example, Australia. Where I live. We're doing just fine. The ISPs haven't started kicking the doors down, killking our parents and raping our pets yet.

Not only that, but it's my understanding that this vote essentially returns the AMERICAN internet back to how it was in 2015 - is that correct? If so, I don't remember anything about The ISP Wars where citizens had to hole up with their multiplatter RAID arrays just so they could get their intarwebz.

I dunno, maybe I'm talking out of my ass and have no idea, seeing as I live on that silly little upside-down island with spiders the size of cars and brightly coloured monopoly money for currency.

tl;dr - America isn't the only country on Earth with internet. The rest of the world is amused by your histrionics.
$C: My thoughts exactly.
$C: Honestly, everyone needs to take a step back and chill the fuck out about net neutrality. The doomsday "internet packages" scenario was never made illegal by net neutrality.

This is the only relavent section on consumer protections in relation to the sites they access in the net neutrality act

>No Blocking. Consumers who subscribe to a retailbroadband Internetaccess service must get what they have paid for—access to all (lawful) destinations on the Internet. This essential and well-accepted principle has long been a tenet of Commission policy, stretching back to its landmark decision in Carterfone ,which protected a customer’s right to connect a telephone to the monopoly telephone network .

If you notice, they say consumers "must get what they have paid for." This means that an ISP can't block you from accessing reddit completley. This does not prevent them from making you pay more to gain access to reddit. There is nothing in there that says ISPs cant charge site by site access.

They do mention that they cant charge content PROVIDERS(Reddit, Netflix, Google) more to prioritize their service. This is why NN has been shoved in the face of everone on this site. Reddit. Reddit is a fucking huge website, the 8th largest. They have more page views than instagram, twitter, netflix, and amazon. The reddit admins are fucking terrified, because now ISPs can charge them more becuase they use a shit ton of their bandwith.

I agree with net neutrality, but reddit has decivingly framed it as a consumer protection law when it was mostly a coorperation protection law. 

I would like to see a reviesd net neutrality law that says cable companies can't keep the consumer from accessing certian sites, but they can charge companies more for being bandwith hogs. 
$C: To save the internet, download the entire internet. Only use floppy disks tho, they're the only storage you can trust /s
$C: Nothing worse than fear mongers
$C: Yes.
$C: If the website has any back-end code, you won't be able to access it without being given it. You can right-click the page you're currently on, "save as", and a copy of the front-end code (HTML, CSS, JS) will be saved to a folder. I would venture to say a majority of websites won't function as intended through this method of "downloading websites" due to no access to their database/back-end code.
$C: I think on the front end, most sites are using javascript, css, and good old fashioned HTML. On the backend, web pages commonly use PHP to transfer data into formats which can then be received into SQL databases. The networking and web hosting services are a completely different beast. Google is the largest web hosting service, meaning they will sell you the infrastructure to store your website and data (typically these run on top of an Apache based web server and have some kind of storage array) as well as dealing with the network side of things, which would be something like load balancing which enables the ability to have large numbers of people access your site at the same time without the net making too many requests of the server. But yeah, most webpages are being hosted on someone or some entities storage drives. You can definitely download web pages, but without access to their databases (hard drives on the back end) the information would be static like a snapshot, not plugged into anything.

$C: - everyone who said DJT wont be president lmao
$C: Famous last words
$C: !remindme 04/01/2019
$C: I'd argue this shit _is_ going to happen, along with a myriad of other destructive repercussions that weren't even mentioned. This is, without a doubt, the darkest day for the Internet as we know it.
$C: Actually I think this assessment is pretty reasonable. Anything seen as immoral will be seen as something to stop supporting when ISP's "have the choice" and aren't "forced" to support all data. You will be able to visit Fox and bible websites. Everything else will be "too immoral - bad for business" and such. 
$C: Not right away and not before the 2018 elections.
$C: dude if any of this happens it won't be tomorrow this guy is typing like they can active these extremely anti-consumer practices by Saturday. IF this happens it's gonna take a few years to sneak into place before it's too late. We just gotta keep an eye on ISPs and make sure they aren't going to try to sneak up with bullshit.
$C: Many of the ISPs own the content they're selling also.
$C: Fuck moral code because free stuff lel
$C: Someone actually took the time to type all this out
$C: Silence, shill trash.
$C: This whole thing is an overreaction. The only consumer protection that net neutrality offered was preventing your ISP from blocking outright access to specific websites. It says "consumers must get what they have paid for". Making internet packages would be legal, because you didn't pay for access to those websites. 

>No Blocking. Consumers who subscribe to a retailbroadband Internetaccess service must get what they have paid for—access to all (lawful) destinations on the Internet. This essential and well-accepted principle has long been a tenet of Commission policy, stretching back to its landmark decision in Carterfone ,which protected a customer’s right to connect a telephone to the monopoly telephone network .

The law did however prevent them from charging content providers more based on the bandwith they use. Thats why reddit pushed net neutrality so hard, becuase the admins know that.
$C: We can talk in 10-15 years. That's when we're really gonna start seeing the effects.

Do you think that change will come quickly? People would notice that. They want it to be slow enough so that people get used to the old bullshit before they come with something new.

During that time it will be a lot of back and forth, but if people don't fight this thing we'll all be worse off for it. Well, not all. Poor people will be worse off for it. But poor people have it too easy anyways, right?
$C: The current generation is already trained for this by their use of cell phones. As long as they start the roll out with cheaper deals it will be easy.
$C: [deleted]
$C: This is grossly impractical. I program computers for a living and work from home. I have literally no choice but to have internet access to my house; I can't work without it.

Furthermore, you can't just boycott a basic utility like internet. What you're saying is akin to "Don't like the price of electricity? Just live without power for a few ~~days~~ ~~weeks~~ ~~months~~ years! It won't be easy, but eventually you'll show them!" Except you won't show them, because people *need* electricity and literally don't know how to live without it. That's why there are laws that regulate the price of electricity: The electric company has you over a barrel and you bet your ass they would price gouge the shit out of that service if they were allowed to.

No one's going to cut their internet connection in protest of this. "Voting with your wallet" is not going to fix this. The internet is way too integrated into our lives to go back now; it's basically a necessity for living in a 1st world country. That's *why* there's so much public support for classifying it as a utility and why this decision is so alarming.
$C: Every empire will eventually fall. It just might be the U.S.'s turn.
$C: I always think of the USA as being at the bottom of the list of advanced / first world countries.  Still on the list, but there's so much more it could be.
$C: Yeah good thing Google is not an American company.. Oh wait. I guess we can just use yahoo.. Oh wait. Bing? Oh.. nvm 
$C: [deleted]
$C: No reason to be a dick about it
$C: Everywhere. Organize a local protest on facebook.
$C: I kinda disagree.  I consider questions regarding privacy and who profits from data mining as net neutrality issues.
$C: I see net neutrality as a cluster of issues including:

* privacy
* free speech and censorship
* regulation of data carriers as public utilities
* issues related to tiering and peering agreements between backbone providers and major content hosts
* data mining and marketing of metadata
* consumer protection

Boiling down these issues to a simple slogan like "net neutrality" is an injustice.
$C: > What's hypocritical about it?

Reddit is posturing nobly about internet freedom here, while not acting quite so nobly in other ways.  That's why I say they are being hypocritical.
$C: > The ends justify the means.

The ends justify the memes.
$C: I disagree. As I replied to another person, I see net neutrality as a cluster of issues and boiling down these issues to a simple slogan like "net neutrality" is an injustice.

 you are going to die. face it. but i dont want your stupid fantasy bringing me with you. 7 billion people in the world. what makes you better then the hypothetical ones you think you have to shoot. go get that dear. but fuck your semi-auto murder sticks. 

you know it doesnt even matter. this conversation is history anyway. lets go get guns, eat mcdonalds, and go see star wars. im sure everythings fine. how couldnt it be. we got food, ammo, and yoda, i mean, god. whatever. see the new babe on FOX. hubba hubba. 
$C: What kind of rambo fantasy you living in. They have star wars weapons now. 

You're an ant. You aint fighting shit. Go get that buck. Maybe a goose, hell a home intruder looking for jewlery maybe, but you will not stand a chance against the US armed forces. 

Your more likely to be shot by your own gun then one of the great oppressors anyway. I have a lot of gun owner friends. Its a cute hobby, but other then something else to have to clean and another way to waste money it doesn't change shit. They will never live out that hero fantasy of theirs. 

Guns are worthless. Free exchange of ideas such as this, is priceless. 
$C: and you know, im tired of both you Reps. and Dems. one side is clinging to their pistols, the other side is clinging to their cocks. you are both worthless, and you both do not represent the interest of a better society with smarter people and a clean and sustainable planet.

plastic and Styrofoam everywhere.  richest damn country and everyone's broke. fucking information age and nobody knows a god damn thing. GUNS everywhere, and nobody feels safe. hmm. healthcare industry is 1/goddamn3rd of our economy, and yet everybody is self medicating and/or just flat out killing themselves. 

fucking shining city. see it. no over there. that hill. oh sorry, that's an out of control forest fire. my bad. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: I see. I was wrong then. Thanks a lot for the info.
$C: That's not how it works either.
$C: We'll stay vigilant. Thank you for your valuable advice.
$C: It's time to vote hard and advocate for Democrats to win and represent our interests then. 
$C: While I agree, I think that abandoning half of our citizens to their own self-imposed ignorance is regretful.
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves. Violence was part of equal rights for Race and Gender. Violence stopped the Nazis and saved millions of lives. Violence created our Country and maintained it. It is a tool and in some situations it is the best tool for the job. This is one of those situations because all other avenues have been exhausted and the powers of the government themselves are being abused So there it is. There is the solution.     

I know you all won't listen and I know we will lose the internet because of it. I hope your ego and pretentious morality was worth us losing one the greatest wonders of the human world. My resentment is no longer just for the corrupt human garbage that pushed against Net Neutrality, but also now for all of you who allowed it to happen just because you didn't want to get dirty to clean up the filth.    

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: This right here.

We have a limited window of public passion to capitalize on whatever ground we can win back. I hope we make the most of it.
$C: America isn't the world dude.
$C: Good.  I mean I know I'm getting ahead of myself here, but it seems like this is probably the path we'll be going down now.  So if an injunction is indeed what should follow, that will be good.  I have much more faith in the court of law than I do in the FCC.
$C: okay gotcha. thanks for the update
$C: F
$C: F
$C: F
$C: Swing and a miss!
$C: America, land of the "sorry, to access this you have to subscribe to our freedom package. Starting at $14.99 a month"
$C: That actually clears it up a lot. Thank you!
$C: They can't, in fact - I'd wager most of the GOPs problems are because of this.  They can't control the media anymore and the dumb shit they do/say spreads to the general population faster than they can try to put out fires.



$C: We're pretty screwed with Brexit too, but we'll happily accommodate.
$C: *Comment removed*
$C: Ah, well. I can cross my fingers that something comes up, I guess, but I doubt it.
$C: Okay, thanks for the constructive comment.
$C: None. An FCC power grab has been reversed, and regulatory authority over the internet returns to the FTC which handled it just fine pre-2015. 
$C: I'm not trying to be unreasonable but why exactly are you okay with this?
$C: Why's that?
$C: I suppose it will weed out a lot of kids who can’t afford to pay for individual social media sites.

But I can’t imagine myself paying one penny just to look at Facebook and Reddit.  Especially since they are loaded with ads. 

Definitely a good time to abandon social media if this kicks in.


$C: You may have meant r/the_donald instead of R/the_donald.

$C: YEAH YOU ARE THE MORAN!
$C: it already has.
$C: By recommendation of Mitch McConnell, due to the fact that the FCC requires a minimum of two representatives from each party. Stop being misleading.
$C: Guess what? The Net neutrality repeal happened under the auspices of the Trump administration. He did not even lift a finger to stop it because he wanted it to happen.

Enough with the blame of Obama/Hillary/Democrats or whatever, they aren't in control of any branch of government currently. Sickening whataboutism. 
$C: Touché....
$C: Why not? For something as big as Net Neutrality we all should be willing to sacrifice a little to show them we mean business!

I'll start by giving up r/politics!
$C: The way the vote was going to go has been known for the longest time. I don't know why people thought there would be a last-minute change of heart from any of the three suspected to vote "repeal."
$C: I'm sure spez will just edit things in the backend to "correct" things.
$C: He's making an educated guess. His educated guess proved to be correct.
$C: What..
$C: First I'd have to buy the social media package to gain access to reddit
$C: He'll spin his fidget spinner so fast that it turns into a propeller and he will fly away to his castle in the dark
$C: Thank you (and to everyone who responded).  The impetus for my question (and I *have* done research on this, but honestly I feel like I can’t keep up), was his sales pitch.  The FCC chairman made it seem as if “we” were all overreacting.  Of course I realize that he’s full of shit, but it made me wonder what made them (ISPs) “behave” prior to 2015.  The answer, I guess, is that they DIDN’T.  They didn’t behave and they glossed over that in their “sales pitch” (of course).  
$C: Comcast did throttle netflix though. So it's not a what if, it was already starting to happen.
$C: Arguing speculation is exhausting. 
$C: 4chan troll called a bomb threat 
$C: Chat is back on and people are reentering
$C: Because there is no bomb? Just want to disrupt it? idk man I never call in bomb threats. 
$C: All is good, America can go on being fucked. 
$C: Wait really?
$C: For the people has not happened for decades it's for the politicians and special interest groups.  Better polish up on your Haxor skillz or your going to bend over some more for your internet service and phone service.
$C: The vote was passed 2 - 3
$C: Holy Shit, Mimi Walters? She just got added to the list. Issa, Rohrabacher and Walters. How deaf to her constituency can she be?

Mimi done fucked up right here.
$C: Sounds fun
$C: How many more signatures, how many more phone calls, how many more texts, how many more tweets do we have to send out until they start to listen? They don't give a shit about what we think and they  made it clear today. 
$C: Ok. But do they have to start paying for faster internet speed?
$C: Yes, very very many people remember. 
$C: Yes.
$C: The congressmen didn't vote on anything. The board of the FCC, whose head was installed by Trump, voted to repeal net neutrality. 
$C: Joined the FCC under Obama, but was made president of it by Trump in January. 

EDIT: Let's not forget, he also saw Pai's plan to end net neutrality and said that he'd happily extend his term of service to another 5 years. 
$C: I don't remember how it was different to be honest. It surely wasn't as bad as how it presumably will be now that we have lost Net Neutrality. 
$C: Head back over to t_d little snowflake.
$C: Says the retard supporting the death of free speech.
$C: ehh let em. All they're gonna get is some kinky shit outta me.
$C: There has literally not been a year (or day) since the creation of the net where net neutrality was absent.
$C: They don't have President Trump so NO - they *easily* have it better
$C: They were just told to fear it leaving.
$C: Right? If he was blown up I might let out a little smirk. 
$C: And it should be investigated and punished as such, I agree.  That said, sending in Judge Dredd the "judge, jury, and executioner" doesn't really work out in reality like some wish it would.
$C: Violence at this point is basically the only option we reasonably have.
$C: Appeal to the next level of authority/oversight to investigate and/or criminally charge those involved to resolve the matter?

I mean, we're all rooting for Mueller still, right?  There's hope he can do his job and fix this even larger situation.  Let's keep trying to do the same with the FCC/courts before we go all Mad Max.  I mean, I do love cars and leather but... they didn't have the internet in that world.

More seriously... MLK and Lincoln were assassinated by those not happy with their beliefs.  Yet here we are, in a (admittedly not perfect) much better place that I think they would be happier about.  So it didn't really work out so well for the team that wanted them dead.  
$C: Context is important.  If the government one day tries to use the military/national guard/whatever armed forces to suppress the people, yes, the 2nd amendment is in place so that people have guns to resist.  

If the chairman of the FCC is a paid off shill who makes a questionably legal decision that has yet to be challenged in court or overturned by congress... yeah, I'm a little surprised when people start calling for 2nd amendment level of violence.  
$C: Killing them would be a defense mechanism for the future at this point. A warning that you must listen to the people you represent. The people actively tried to have their voices heard on this issue peacefully, they were just as actively ignored by the FCC for greed. If I were the jury and executioner, I would have them killed for treason.
$C: its the latter, the left has become dogmatic its a religion at this point.
$C: We live in a society.  If people began killing others with justifications such as yours, how will you feel when someone kills your family/friend because they disagreed with them and felt it affected millions?  You can't go down that path as much as it seems like an easy solution.  It just doesn't generally work out well in reality.
$C: some criminals do.
$C: Puuuussssssssyyyy
$C: According to Wikipedia, he was appointed to the FCC as a member under Obama, then became the chairman of the FCC under Trump. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajit_Pai
$C: You're right. However, Trump moved Pai to being the chairman of the FCC specifically.
$C: Says the one spreading misleading information. Pai was selected by Obama on the recommendation of Mitch McConnell due to the fact that the FCC requires a minimum of two representatives from each party.
$C: Yes and thank you, I've corrected that in my comment. The democrats are the lesser of two evils but have a centrist bent that comes back to bite them. Obama, in a naive show of  bipartisanship appointed Pai on Mitch McConnel's recommendation. I went by their political affiliation as opposed to who appointed them originally. Overall point still stands.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Yes. Appointed by people who were voted in and clearly said they would repeal net neutrality.
$C: yeah i should accept a garbage system in one of the wealthiest and most powerful countries in the world because other poor countries have it worse right? what an enlightening point 
$C: if you don’t love it, leave it amirite?!
$C: [deleted]
$C: What's being done is an abuse of power I expect to see righted give due course, because thankfully for the most part that's how our country is designed to keep government officials in check.  Though my comments on compromise was against people twisting it into a political party issue, something that is getting vastly out of hand in the US, once things are drawn as being one side or the other the message gets lost among a incredible number of other issues, and pointlessly making enemies of people who believe the same as you, it's damaging to the effort of maintaining net neutrality as a whole.  In fact it's borderline crippling to our political process, and at least in my eyes, incredibly naive.
$C: You guys do need to do something though. Your democracy is broken!
$C: If the democrats had majority, the telecom companies would just send them millions instead and the results would have been the same.

Basically they did not pay off the democrats because they did not need to.

Both parties are bought and paid for.  The issue is money in politics.
$C: lmao so every democrat was against repealing NN?

EDIT; srry i have a timer on my replies so i cant reply to all you idiots in a timely manner. Obama appointed Pai, a verizon lawyer lol. yes, i understand dems voted in 2011 in favor of NN. this is 2017 however, many of those dems do not take the same stance now that their fearless leader Obama is gone. 

Call me a liar all you want and hold your blue donkey close to your heart while it whispers propaganda into your ears. whatever makes you feel better about believing the lies you've been told.

top candidate donee; Hillary Clinton
$C: https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000022131

As Partisan as the telecom lobby backing the democrat executive branch candidate in 2016 and the republican congress in 2016?

Pay attention.
$C: The ones that were appointed by Barack, and were on Hillary Clinton's nominee list? 

You know, the ones who got the most money from the telecoms in the 2016 cycle? https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000022131


Or want to go back to 2012, and see who paid for Barack Obama's inauguration? Or was on the top 10 donors of his list?

If you think Comcast is too dumb to buy a D white house and an R congress and push through something wildly unpopular by using a few steps of partisan appeal - don't know what to say. They're billion dollar companies with trillions in infrastructure, with teams of people analyzing these approaches to buying government.


They aren't you.
$C: >Shit, I bet we could band together and "sponsor" politicians for better results.

If you actually believe that they were purchased for such a low amount, why don't you? 


$C: A+ for what? Bullshit? He tried to blame Hillary for the corrupt Republicans voting unanimously to repeal net neutrality.

Hillary, like 95% of Democrats, is firmly for net neutrality. It is only conservatives that consistently adopt anti-internet rules. You get what you vote for.


$C: Regulation means nothing if it's a monopoly that's protected by the very same regulation. That means no matter what fine you hit them with or what regulation you toss on them, they just pass on the cost to you and you *must* bear it.

It's like a company paying you $200k a year and they are legally mandated to keep you around, no matter what you do. You steal office supplies, they charge you $500, you raise your rate by $5 an hour to cover it.


If you strip away the FCC right now, Comcast/Verizon/etc have no protectionism in place for start ups. Someone WILL get mad enough to start their own ISP (or cities will). Under current Title II, you must bear the regulatory burden of it.

It'd cost at least $50 million, before you lay a single line. One stroke of the pen, dissolving the FCC, would reduce that to $0 (well minus basic business licenses and such).


So which would you rather have it? The FCC and Comcast/Verizon/etc monopolies who rule and make billions off your forced use of them (can't get decent internet any other way, remember) or crack the shell open and let the market take it to split Comcast/Verizon's attention in market operations we you lobby your congressmen to institute a new legislative net neutrality?


Comcast will have infinitely harder time fighting a multi-front war. Right now they have a one front war: 3 members of the FCC and just the president. They were banking on Hillary being president anyways: https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000022131
$C: No.

I'm simply pointing out that this was in the works by comcast. Do you not understand this? This is the POINT.

"Hi, stop your tribal bullshit for .02 seconds and realizes comcast is buying whole branches of US gov, including democrat executive branches, to write regulatory law as they want it."
$C: That's the trouble.

The regulations have piled on so high, now it's more lucrative to own the government.


Progressives refuse to back off regulation for a while to deregulate and release businesses from the strangle-hold of power due to the short-term pearl clutching.

Republicans are enjoying the abuse of power. 


So...yeah. It sucks, but until progressives can be educated in why deregulations is a necessary part of a government's survival to prevent this or until republicans somehow start giving a shit about personal freedom....

Welp.
$C: He didn't put thought into it. He tried to blame Hillary for the corrupt Republicans voting unanimously to repeal net neutrality.

Hillary, like 95% of Democrats, is firmly for net neutrality. It is only conservatives that consistently adopt anti-internet rules.
$C: >  why you think a legislative action rather than FTC antitrust enforcement under current law is the way to go? 

Right now it's harder to buy all of congress and get them to agree on a bill than it is for the exec agency to issue a policy and congress to simply pass it off.

We saw SOPA/PIPA etc fail with even higher republican majorities, but we're seeing FCC actions taken just require a stamp of approval - a much different process than forcing folks to vote on actual new legal provisions - so it's reasonable to assume any FTC can be as easily swayed in the future.


> evolution of abusive behavior over time

I agree if this was a more free market, but it's not. Currently we have regulated, protected monopolies. If we broke up the FCC and repealed a majority of the federal regulation outside wireless spectrum management, this would be more viable - but we need competitors in the market to make the FTC's penalties have weight.

Otherwise, they'll just do what they did post the 1970s baby-bell break up: start acquiring each other through parent companies again.


> Also, the FTC is already set up as a tribunal experienced and equipped to handle abuses of market power, while new legislation would have to either point to an existing tribunal (either by explicitly expanding the FTC's current authority, sending it to the courts or the FCC that just rejected the role) or create a new agency altogether.

I would like to see the FTC take this up, and dissolve the FCC and return wireless spectrum management back to the dept of the interior like it was pre-1970.

But we need to break the hold on the market as well for this to stick or it'll just be a new agency for comcast to lobby and secure control of via executive authority.

Folks forget, as a utility, the telecoms enjoy the same level of protectionism as a water company or electric company, for something you do not depend on for safety reasons (no one is dying due to a shorting cable or DSL line, for instance or dying due to internet as in the case of bad water).


I don't view the internet or telephone as a utility. No one should, it's a service, and one that you don't need to survive (granted its essential, but there's a difference between essential and needed). We now rely mostly on mobile phones, anyways, so even the argument that landline protectionism to 'maintain non-interruptions in service' is specious at best.

Overall statement: I agree with you, but we need congress to dissolve the FCC and remove the authority of the executive branch to regulate telecoms outside the wireless spectrum, and create a 'water access rights' style law at the federal level that forbids denying access. This way you can still have 'fast' lanes for more money, but you cannot throttle below the basic service level you offer (tl;dr if you have 100mbits, you get that everywhere, but some sites may give you 250mbits if you pay for that, eg streaming package).


I'm okay with that model. While I don't know if it'll be successful in the face of 20 major broadband vs the 5 majors we have today, that's for the market to decide, not me.


The FTC then can determine what companies hold monopoly control, and trust-bust them via the FTC and grant access to the lines to new companies who no longer face the deadening burden of the cost of regulation.


This goes into detail why it's impossible to start up an ISP and why we need to deregulate the internet/telecoms in general: https://www.whoishostingthis.com/blog/2015/03/09/start-your-own-isp/

It's not saying 'let the telecoms run the show', but rather, let's take away their protectionism and only place in a basic set of interoperability rules that mandate access rights, similar to water access rights. 
$C: No. They repealed it. 3-2
$C: I hope you are but one of many who have decided the same. I'm tired of being afraid for my life and well-being because of this GOP era Republican bullshit. It wasn't always this way and there are many people who are Republican that don't believe half the bullshit that this GOP is spouting- but far too many are willing to let that slide just to have the little R on their voter card. 

So thank you for standing up for yourself and other people instead of just shrugging and looking away. 
$C: Glad to have you on board!  A free internet is still possible if we can get enough of the right people in office. 
$C: Same, the whole party at this point needs to be gutted and restructured as its just rotten to the core. 
$C: Part of me wants to laugh at you for thinking they ever had your interests in mind (unless you know the real higher ups personally).  But then I get sad when I realize you're a real person and there are millions more of you out there that haven't figured it out yet.
$C: Yes. Lets fucking do it.

Don’t forget what happened. Kill em.
$C: Both sides are corrupt for different reasons, lets work to remove the corrupt parts of both and combine em.
$C: fReE sPeEcH
$C: They’re definitely on the wrong side of an issue that a lot of people on a very diverse political spectrum care about a lot.
$C: congratulations
$C: You'll never get 100% corruption free, but the parties are [not even close](https://np.reddit.com/r/books/comments/77fqhe/the_fcc_is_expected_to_announce_a_vote_to_gut_net/dolvv8r/) to the same. It doesn't matter if corporations donate to both parties if Democrats vote to do the right thing anyway.
$C: Dems have their problems, Republicans are a problem. (Talking about the politicians)
$C: [deleted]
$C: Do you think they’ll take your guns, or they’ll make them harder to get?  I have 9 guns, if they’re harder to get I don’t really care.  I don’t imagine they’ll ever take our guns in our lifetime.   Putting up with the bullshit republicans are constantly pulling is not worth being afraid of a bit of gun control.  
$C: What part of gun control do you disagree with specifically?
$C: The problem is the lefts lunacy on gun control undercuts their legitimacy in every other topic. If they lie about guns, what else are they lying about?
$C: If introverted whites stopped shooting up schools, we would.
$C: There is this insane narrative democrats want to take away guns, *period*. 

Fact check: No, we just want to keep guns out of the hands of clinical psychopaths and the mentally unstable who want to shoot up theaters and malls. Because at the end of the day, doesn't matter who the psychopath is: Democrat, Republican; they're still a gun wielding psychopath. 

Is that bad? To want to assuage some kind of control and distribution of a category of weapons that can kill other citizens and individuals en masse? The only thing stopping mass shootings from being even worst is most of the time, the guns themselves are in less than stellar condition and are chambered in the least optimal way. 

If that's a bad thing, then you know what? Sure. Let's go to the other extreme. Let's see how that goes. 
$C: Vote in Democratic primaries. Moderates need to learn they can’t cede the nominating process to the extremes and expect to have decent choices.
$C: Why should it be hard to get a deadly weapon? It's my right as an American to kill my countrymen for "disrespecting the flag" or whatever Fox News is telling me to be angry about. 
$C: I would gladly vote blue until fucking doomsday if only their solution to everything wasn't 'tax the living shit out of everyone'.
$C: Edit: Downvotes but no arguments to the contrary? Fucking cowards.

I don't want to affect your gun ownership, unless you've a history of violence/mental illness. You bought it, it's yours. 

Kind of like fireworks, they're dangerous in the wrong hands. Kids lose digits in accidents every year from just the small ones. The *really big* ones require specialized licenses to store/handle/use, or you could inadvertently blow yourself/others up.

What most want is just *data* on firearms to make informed policy. More restrictions are just blind attempts at solving a problem they know nothing about; it's often ignorant and wasteful. But that data is presently illegal for the FBI or CDC to accumulate.

But instead the NRA labels anyone who wants *any* policy involving firearms as some manner of communist-nazi monster.

I fucking *love* firearms; their mechanics are why I studied mechanical engineering in the first place. A large percentage of US citizens still rely on hunting for their primary source of food. They're a necessary facet of many people's lives, not just a recreational tool.

I crafted a modernized De Lisle carbine, by the way. .45 subsonic rounds. Cycling the bolt is louder than the report. I participate in marksmanship competitions. I wholy support firearm ownership.

Should my friend's dad, who has had repeated strokes and has a frontal lobe that resembles swiss-cheese with a history of violence and mental illness, be allowed to have my rifle? He would go on a murdering spree.

But without data on the matter, nothing stops him. He already managed to amass a stockpile. Attempted to murder his family. It was only *then* that his access to firearms were limited, and he's certifiably nuts.

Two of my childhood friends were murdered by their dad. Murder-suicide. He had a history of abuse and domestic violence. Shot both of them with a shotgun. They had a new school playground named after them.

That's some fucked up shit.


$C: you will eat these words
$C: You guys lost fucking Alabama to a pro choice democrat, you lost the popular vote with the president every election since Clinton, and have resorted to gerrymandering to keep political power... pretty clear which party is going extinct.
$C: I’m tired of being fucked in the ass by single issue voters so I might as well be like them instead.
$C: Because fuck america right?
$C: Then fuck you.
$C: Thats not true. Net Neutrality laws are voted strictly on party lines, check the voting history. Democrats are pro net neutrality and Republicans are anti-net neutrality. Thats the way they voted on for every net neutrality legislation.
$C: Fuck that shit. Be the change you wanna see. Get involved.
$C: lol seriously? climate change, healthcare, immigration, gun control, net neutrality, bank regulation. You need an education. Both parties are on polar opposites. 
$C: Dur dur both sides are the same. 
$C: Good job throwing away your vote, fam
$C: People don't get it has nothing to do with parties.  They are fucking moron's if they believe that.  we need less government regulation and remove power from greedy corporations
$C: we'll outlaw abortion when we legalize chemical castration for men who commit sexual harassment
$C: they think it is. 
$C: Of course all liberals will come to you, provoke you, make you brigade something to only make a screenshot, right? Everybody is at fault except for me and my side because they are perfect, it's all faked by <enemy_name>.

Also, Reddit never was a free speech platform. When you register an account you agree to the terms and conditions that basically state that you can get banned whenever Reddit wants, and it can happen to anybody.

Also, one more person that hates net neutrality just because liberals like it, apparently. There can be no agreement between the parties eh?
$C: "If I bold everything it will come true."
$C: "Free and open internet except for _______" isn't really free and open now is it.
$C: Can't find the national socialist german worker's party here anywhere. Good try though, fitting a definition to a word. 
$C: Wanna try again to formulate an English sentence fuckwit?
$C: Couldn't new deals be cut? Money talks.
$C: Yeah but Disney just bought Fox. What if they bribe your ISP to censor/block your precious, and only, source of news? 
$C: Get this man some campaign financing! He's making too much sense!
$C: I hope your mommy decides not to pay for the more expensive porn package when the companies decide to charge more :)
$C: Your logic makes 0 sense. Sorry you're wrong. 


$C: Too bad the people you voted for weren't 

Donald Trump hired Ajit Pai to be FCC commish... Should we blame someone else? 
$C: Remind me who made Pai the head of the FCC? Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm Donald Trump

Who created net neutrality? Obama. Use your brain
$C: That's not true either. I personally know someone who started a small Fiber company in the rural Midwest to deliver high speed access to areas where the big ISPs weren't improving their infrastructure.

If anything, the regulations that were wrapped up inside the Net Neutrality Act made it *more* difficult for smaller companies like his to even lay fiber. He told me "We just wanted to build a network, not make some lawyer rich".

They persisted anyway, and their proof of concept model is doing great in the places it's been implemented.
$C: They have even more competition now than they did in 2015. Mobile internet has opened everything up. Would I like more competition on the ISP level? Yes. 

And we do that by blocking the merger of AT&T and Time-Warner. Maybe even start splitting up these huge monopolies instead of layering on a bunch of needless regulations. 
$C: But were they doing it before 2015 when these regulations were put in place?
$C: But it didn't happen in the US before these regulations were put in place right? It's not as if Comcast did that in the US and then these regulations were reactionary.

Seems a little sensationalist. I'm admittedly an anti-regulation type of person, so I certainly have a bias, but it seems like much ado about nothing unless those practices had actually been employed which they weren't.
$C: So lets make it easier for people to start their own ISP.

And censorship has happened during NN too, so its not like its done any good.
$C: Like I said in another comment, I don't really agree with the "ISPs can't be competitive" argument.

I personally work with someone who started a small Fiber ISP in the rural midwest in areas where the the large ISPs wouldn't improve their infrastructure, and its working just fine. In fact, when I asked him about it, he basically said "Raising the money to lay the fiber and build the network wasn't the hard part. We easily got early adopters signed up and raised the capital. The difficult part was paying legal fees just to get through all the regulatory red tape. We just wanted to build a network, not make some lawyers rich."

It's typically gov regulation that hampers innovation and competition, it doesn't aid it. ISPs do not have to be these massive bloated companies like Comcast and Time Warner.

$C: But there wasn't anything stopping them from 1991-2015 either. I can understand maybe saying "well, those were the early days of the internet so that sort of practice hadn't really been though up yet", but 2015 was only 2 years ago.

I remember seeing this stuff back in like 2012-2013. In fact, I met Corey Doctorow (Electronic Frontier Foundation, net-neutrality blogger/activist) on his book tour to get my copy of Little Brother signed in 2013 and I remember him saying the exact same things then. Yet 2013, 2014, and 2015 came and went without any Net Neutrality regulations and the ISPs didn't do what he was claiming they were going to do then either.
$C: "They didnt do it but totally will now".


Got it. 
$C: Be a diligent consumer and you're fine. Be a lazy bitch and buy EA games and you deserve to get fucked. The government isn't your mommy
$C: And violence is the only answer left, right?
$C: I'd agree if we were talking about Putin or Kim Jong-un (yes, contradicting myself), but this one isn't on that scale I don't think. 

Again, I'm sure there's a way to mess with their lives that doesn't involve violence. 
$C: Yea, I agree. 

Just looks like a lot of gaslighting going on. 
$C: I was speaking in a general sense.
$C: > On this issue?

> on everything? That's dangerous as fuck


Nah. Turns out they're polar opposites on pretty much everything. 

"Both sides are the same" is pretty much the laziest and most ignorant political view one can hold today. And it's why Net Neutrality has been repealed today. Thanks!

Nader’s entire campaign was that Bush = Gore, they are essentially the same. Fucking whoops...
$C: Oh. Well fuck. Then the live thread should really be reversed. Currently it's saying that Carr and Reilly are Pro-NN.
$C: There are four lights!

They had to adjourn because of a security threat.  It'll be back up soon.
$C: No

$C: Emmanuel Macron said he wanted to regulate more video games and adult contents through our superior audiovisual council. This is so vague, he can do anywhere saying this. I am so afraid.
$C: Rip. I’m in Canada, so I guess Parlement has a chance of refusing it if Trudeau doesn’t want the FCC.
$C: If that's the angle they're coming from then I think NN ending is a bygone conclusion.
$C: So is the repeal going into effect? Thanks for the speedy reply btw. 
$C: Yep
$C: How come people don't have a vote on it if it's public interest?
$C: America elected the president who appointed this guy, who repealed Net Neutrality.  As a country, we asked for this.
$C: damn...

well lets hope congress shuts this shit down

$C: I'm not very familiar with U.S laws. Could you elaborate what is this 'citizens united' you refer to?

Wikipedia make me even more confused.
$C: Well I can give them money too. They can have all of my $327
$C: Don’t you think it could be argued that lobbying and money has overridden much of how much say we have in these rulings, though? I guess what I’m trying to say is, did many Americans stop voting because they felt that their efforts were fruitless? 
$C: I just found the names, thanks. And no, I'm definitely not advocating for violence. I just think we should know that these are the people who decided to sell us to the highest bidder. More along the lines of an asterisk or demerit that would come up whenever you searched net neutrality or their names. 
$C: We used ALL the bots we could! How could this not work!!
$C: So what are the negatives?  If the throttle one site, I’m assuming there taking away from another?  Am I correct?
$C: Not sure I follow you on that one. Just making fun of a horrible person's name isn't racist, sensitivo.
$C: Repealing it
$C: That's the point of my comment; there is very little that young people of my ideology can do to stop this growing shift from a democracy for and by the people toward authoritarianism and corporatocracy.

We definitely are changing as a nation, but how exactly does this shift in national policy away from a free and open internet make America a greater place for the average citizen to live, work, and prosper?
$C: Not a Trump supporter. Not a Conservative. I am fully aware of how the interwebs were pre "Net-Neutrality". I am also aware of how competition makes things better. And I am also aware of the fact that the FCC has been deciding what we can or can not see since it was first created. I'd rather choose my own content provider based on their rules as I have no choice when it comes to the FCC.

Just because you're ignorant, or a partisan who wants to blindly support conservatives, doesn't mean damage wasn't being done.
$C: None of the major media outlets are covering this. Which means nobody cares. Protests get media coverage which makes people take notice because its interesting. A post could get a million upvotes on Reddit and literally no one outside of normal visitors here would care.

$C: I think it's mostly just that the fuckwits of t_D really just belong on Voat or Daily Stormer or any of the other places that cater to morons with no morals. It's not really censorship, since they could still say whatever they wanted, but there's not really a reason to help them out with it. I mean, that entire sub has the collective intelligence of a single brain damaged flatworm, and they devote their last remaining wits to trolling.

Not really sure why you'd get all butthurt about the idea of them not being here. Definitely not sure why you'd be crying about it in this thread.
$C: [deleted]
$C: They don’t do this. They are split on the issue of NN, The ones that support it use the fact that Comcast owns CNN, which goes to show that at least some of them are reasonable. 
$C: Wait, so until right now, you have no idea what the opposing arguments of the debate are?  Yet you have so strongly chosen your side?  You don't see a problem with that?
$C: Um... Read this thread and you can't tell why?
$C: We disagree on what "net neutrality" means. Not all people who support this decision believe that content should be throttled or access restricted, in fact I would say the vast majority agree that should not be allowed. 

The problem arises when names like "net neutrality" or "pro - life" start getting tossed around and the specifics are not discussed. How can you be opposed to life, or choice, or neutrality, or even being a patriot (act)?

What does this vote *do* exactly? It changes the regulatory body from the FTC back to the FCC and changes ISPs from a "common carrier" back to a "information provider".

There is absolutely **no** reason that regulations cant be put in place to quell the concerns of most of the vocal advocates of net neutrality have while being under the regulatory scrutiny of the FCC. In fact, the FCC has the authority to put in place *more* restrictive regulations than the FTC would. 

This debate was unfortunately muddled and was made into a huge strawman. It doesn't need to be. If you want certain provisions and regulations on the internet, there is absolutely zero reason that this cannot be put in place after this action has happened. 

So there is your opposing view to "net neutrality". When you create strawmen like, "how can you be opposed to life? How do you support killing babies?" and not actually debating the specifics or nuances of whats being discussed, the other side can easily think, "How is there an opposing view?"

$C: A lot of us just don't want gov't to have control of the internet. That's pretty reasonable don't you think?
$C: We had no NN until 2015 and everything worked fine.  The NN regulations had a gapping loophole that firms did not need to be net neutral if they don't claim to be net neutral.

So all these regulations were going to be put into place for show.
$C: > how are they always on the controversial side of every single subject.

Is vetting of refugees so controversial? How about investigating things before coming to a conclusion?  
$C: Have you ever asked yourself why you don't ever have a controversial opinion?
$C: /r/latestagecapitalism is probably the worst sub on reddit, even moreso than /r/politics. It's like someone filled a sub with edgy pre-teens who just read the communist manifesto for the first time. The fact that Nazi subs get banned and a sub that stickys the hammer and sickle as the top comment to every post can hit /r/all is insane.
$C: Sedition isn't a crime. It's 1A protected
$C: I got you [covered](http://i.imgur.com/FVIL1MB.gifv)


$C: It's not about the expected outcome. It's about posting an admin notice saying "Following today’s disappointing vote from the FCC" which is false and the vote hasn't occurred yet.
$C: When you explain it like that, it makes perfect sense!
$C: When you explain it like that, it makes perfect sense!
$C: Already seen it, but nice try. Next, let me know if the Titanic sinks. 
$C: No that's complete bullshit. They censor their own content, bad, but how is it going to become better if ISP's are now allowed to censor other's content, too. 

And they weren't the only ones criticising this, hundreds of organizations and companies did, basically *everyone* who is interested in a free internet did. Seriously, can you point to one organization apart from ISP's and politicians, who wanted that repeal?
$C: The fact that Verizon, Charter, Comcast, AT&T were openly in favor repealing Title 2 tells you all you need to know. 


$C: "Corporations are evil" 

"Oh, but hey they support net neutrality, these corporations must not be evil"

I was downvoted heavily for just suggesting that redditors should take that into consideration and do their own research, from both sides, and make their own conclusions, and that they should be suspicious of it *simply* because it was supported by those companies. 

Frankly, I'm not sure repealing Obama's Net Neutrality will have the positive effects it would seem to on paper (no new ISPs are going to pop up and offer competition with the current duopoly) -- but the most recent iterations of net neutrality didn't seem to do shit anyways. 

But that's reddit, research nothing and have every subreddit just say "write your senators" without providing any non-biased argument. If one of the billions of bot-voted net neutrality posts had had a breakdown where they took the anti-net neutrality argument and stated why it they believed it was wrong -- bullet point by bullet point --, or provided any data besides blatant fear-mongering, I would've been impressed by this website. 
$C: The fact that the_donald is pushing so hard for it tells me all *I* need to know
$C: What "internet content" are they censoring?
$C: >and so many others who openly censor internet content were against the repeal of Title 2 is all you need to know.

ISPs can now join the websites you just cited in censoring content. Congratulations?
$C: Salty T_D user, predictably. 
$C: So much this. The same companies who love to censor and hide wrong think on their platforms are fighting for our 'freedoms'.  
$C: You're free to leave if you don't like it here.
$C: Kek
$C: ROLL TIDE
$C: ooh me too

SEND BANS
$C: and a cannibal
$C: This is true, however I don't think there is any amount of information available that will enlighten someone like this. Think climate denier, ultra-religious personality type. 

I believe that one must possess the ability to comprehend information in order to be enlightened by it.
$C: Go back to r/the_donald; adults are talking. 
$C: this but unironically


$C: How about we actually wait and see what happens BEFORE we advocate murder.

My prediction is nothing will change.
$C: Man where is my popcorn, I've got way too much salt with nowhere to put it.
$C: Reported for violence
$C: I have reported you to the FBI.
$C: Papa Pai can’t stop winning!!!
$C: https://streamable.com/uhdjx
$C: Given the fact that you guys can’t even win in Alabama under Trump, I’m not sure that’s such a bad prospect for Democrats. LOL.
$C: Oh calm down its an exaggeration lmao 
$C: Well, yeah. But i meant some sort of social/progressive benefit, which is what he keeps saying the "heavy handed" government is preventing, forgetting all the innovations we have. He even mentions ordering a burrito online, and redundantly repeating several other great things you can do with the internet. Then he says that net neutrality is blocking that progress with no explanation, he literally just says it. It's so clear that it's all for money 
$C: Yes, but those people don't want freedom. They actively support the groups that want to restrict that freedom.

This site isn't the fucking US government. It's a private company that can do what they want.

And what they apparently want to do is say, "We're OK with letting our site be used as an organizational tool for people who want to destroy the freedoms we cherish."
$C: Same reason we want net netruality. ~~Free~~dom of the internet.
$C: Weird how everyone says Mexico when Canada is north of us.
Or you know, I could use a plane to fly to Europe. 
Not like America isn't far from becoming overrun with crazed overzealous lunatics anyways.
$C: The funny part is that you believe Trump is draining the swamp when he's just as much of a corporate shrill as Hilary or Bill. 
$C: triggered bicht
$C: Also, the lady [doth protest too much, methinks](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7j8fkt/an_analysis_of_net_neutrality_activism_on_reddit/)
$C: go back to your hole, troll
$C: boring 
$C: Yes, they are.  I figured most would get the gist, maybe even improve it.
$C: I've seen cringyer.
$C: Eh, it was a random thought.
$C: lmao I've never seen the tendies copypasta edited to death like this. The only part you really kept was the part where your tendies dropped. 
$C: >implying the reason people want it banned is just "waah I don't like it"

nice meme
$C: man we got a real good bunch of memesters in the comments today
$C: N I C E M E M E
$C: Wait, are you saying we should have gathered our guns and killed people over this? Maybe stormed the FCC offices?
$C: It's not even about that. It's not about turns or anything else. It's that she wouldn't have been on the wrong side of things the way Trump and his administration are. Trump being in office puts us back 40 years on everything. The very basic faith we have in our own democracy to be about something bigger than ourselves went out the window when that petty orange turd got elected. Now we will have to deal with the fallout (that's even if he doesn't get us into a war with North Korea) of the Trump administration dismantling things like consumer protections, the internet, environmental protections, etc. Hell, even basic decency that we'd come to expect from the office of the president is out the window. Trump is the equivalent of a dog dragging it's ass across the carpet at this point. It's embarassing. But it's our fault he's there. So many people got caught up in the bullshit and treated Hilary like she was a super villain that was going to form the fucking Legion of Doom. There were people saying a vote for Hilary was a vote for Wallstreet. Yet Trump gave us Mnuchin, he's depending on voodoo economics for anything when it comes to financial policy. It's fucking ridiculous. BUT HER EMAILS. 
$C: It still seems strange to promote a "free and open" internet while at the same time censoring content and editing comments on your own site. And I'm not talking about removing illegal content which I understand.
$C: I encourage you to read my post again. I do not mention Net Neutrality. 
$C: Bingo! This is my point exactly! 
$C: I encourage you to read my post again. I do not mention Net Neutrality.
$C: Exactly!
$C: This has never been a viable excuse to ignore someones valid point. Its fucking lazy. 

I'm willing to believe that you're smart enough to know the difference between advice and hypocrisy, you're just too fucking edgy to not crack a joke. This is the most important issue you will EVER be a part of, take it fucking seriously and help us work to improve our world.

$C: Ohhhh nooooo!!!!! How did the Internet work before this 3 year old title II regulation!! 

*clutches purse*
$C: But the south is so backwards.i grew up in ny first half my life and in south second half so far.  30 plus years and the southern hospitality is a lie.  And all their views are based off of fox news and ways where woman need to knw there place, even tho they are working equal share in households nowadays,  they hate black people secretly and wont completely come out and say it, unless u find those special ones. Every martsin luther king day around the poorer areas of where im at the neiborhoods hang nooses out in front lawns off of trees.  Not to mention the drugs and meth epidemic is from mainly white people down south who lived a kush life who fall into it.  Pretty much doc boys with pink collard shirts and kaki shorts turning into meth heads and blaming it on mexico.  Thats the jist of the south i live in and tbh i hate this backwards ass place
$C:  No,  he's Judy a bigot
$C: Yea but he rode the hatred of the south and rural america.  I also thoufht he lost the pop vote.  Could b wrong, it was a while ago.  
$C: Highest concentration of black people, and all of the statistical problems associated with it.

Often contributed to "dumb inbred rednecks"
$C: >kekistan in username

hahaha stoooopid brumpf supporter XD
$C: Maybe, but Trump made him chairman.
$C: Hahaha not to head of the fcc and he was appointed by trump to head of fcc.  This is the conservitives fault and nobody else to blame..  If u blame anyone else than them then you are clearly under 30 and from a southern state. 
$C: On who’s recommendation? Go ahead, I’ll wait. While you’re at it, take a look at the guidelines that dictate how many members of each party are supposed to be on board. To make it easier, when you search include the term McConnell.
$C: To chairman?
$C: To be the head of the F.C.C.? If so, I hate to inform you: you're delusional or have been fed (most likely intentional) misinformation. 

Educate yourself. Trump appointed Ajit himself, obviously aware Ajit was pro-NN repeal. 
$C: You don't get the way the FCC works, or you're being deliberately disingenuous.
$C: She was a tird but a tird that wanted universal health care and im game with that over anything dumbass trump eants
$C: Ok change taking away money from common folks, warmongering, fear mongering,  the sjw shit i am conservative on,  net neutrality, the wall We are paying for,  guns ur an idiot if u dnt think it needs to be fixed not stripped but reformed,  taxes hahahaha if you make less than 150k a year ur the same when a dem or red is in get real dude.  Oh and ill take sjws over natzi and kkk members any day.
$C: more trucks of peace roaming the streets
$C: Well hopefully you'll be able to browse Reddit again without the constant propaganda being pushed down your throat 

lol....who am I kidding. This is Reddit.
$C: You're a sad person.
$C: THE USER ABOVE IS A MOD AT r/nonetneutrality, and has spammed this message over 40 times pretending to be for net neutrality and violent, presumably because they lead an incredibly sad life, or are paid (redditor for 2 months, random subs, and a mod?). Report, and be aware that these people exist.
$C: It's coming.
$C: I'm trying my hardest!
$C: I do not care what you think.
$C: Yup, it's called "Wake the fuck up"
$C: Didn't say, they just said to leave and came back shortly after 
$C: You do realize that would effect you, and keep you out of it right?
$C: We know how he is, did the rest vote? i didn't hear them vote, just them speak
$C: I totally understand being able to predict the vote. We could do that a few weeks ago. It is just interesting for people to be so sure before the vote took place and comment as if the vote had already happened. 

Especially Spez's original post. 

$C: Of course they were. We all know that. 

Might want to wait until the actual vote goes down before saying it happened if you are in charge of a huge website like this. That is my main point after all. 
$C: Then there's hope that this is just temporary. 
$C: A few. Who knows, maybe the majority of ISPs will decide to block VPN. Not saying it can't happen, but there is a market for at least some ISPs to allow VPN usage somewhere in the country. I definitely wouldn't mind moving somewhere else if the internet turns into a shitshow where certain websites are blocked/cost extra. If everyone accepts the fact that net neutrality is dead, let the ISPs block/charge whatever they want, and the American public is fine with that and continues to pay their bills, then well, fuck me. Maybe at that point, it's time to move out of the country. Point is, neutral internet is incredibly important to me and I couldn't bring myself to pay a scum ISP who toys around with the websites I can visit.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Already on it
$C: I did. I did not experience any issues at all. That has me wondering why people are spazzing out over it. 
$C: What are the potential downfalls of this system?
$C: Laugh all you want but it was the Republicans that just voted to leave control of the internet up to the corporations, not the Democrats.
$C: You live in a fantasy world. These internet providers are about to become totalitarians. 
$C: Sounds peaceful


oh shi-
$C: Mate I'm an Aussie.

We don't need/have bundled internet packages to make our lives shit, we already have 3rd world internet speeds!

Russian bots upvoting posts...on the front page? Buddy, your too far gone.
$C: blame everything on the russians    

typical ignorant pleb    

enjoy paying for everything more expensive than the rest of the world, that includes your education and internet lol
$C: So big companies censoring things is bad, except that one big company censoring things. That's a-okay!

Do I understand you correctly? 
$C: I didn't vote for the guy and I don't like the guy, but I'm getting very tired of this shit. There's no way the net neutrality front page posts were organic, and r/popular was basically created to silence T_D. 


$C: I loved when they were showing how we were all bots by pointing to how much more activity there was for us and how unusual that was.


Then fucking George Takai tried it LOOOOOOL
$C: I didn't vote for the guy and I don't like the guy, but there's 0 fucking chance the net neutrality take over was organic, and r/popular was basically created to silence T_D. It's idiotic. 

For the record, you trump folks can fuck right off, but goddamn this is absurd.
$C: Dude, one liberal to another. Do you seriously think that the net neutrality take over was organic?

Also, trump supporters got what they wanted today, so they're not salty...
$C: How original of you
$C: And he followed with with an Aye.  Then Carr said repealing is a great thing for freedom.  It's been over.
$C: Wait, so it's only down to five votes? That's bad
$C: This is the best copypasta I've seen all day
$C: Well see what voicing complaints did? Nothing. They still voted, and that scumbag is still throwing our civil rights away for bribes. 
$C: Lol - you are the oblivious one - following the rest of the reddit sheeple. Guess what - reddit - the $2 billion dollar company that is a top 10 website doesn't want to pay for bandwidth, because with their business model it simply means less profits for them without a real offset - and you ate up their "organic" campaign of lobbying subreddit moderators to sticky posts and the like. 

The truth isn't an either or, and the internet was a fine place prior to 2015. None of this applies to wireless - and prioritized traffic is already a thing through connection peering - not to mention the FTC exists do deal with the monopoly question. Save my your apocalyptic hyperbole - you have no idea what you are talking about.
$C: So clearly sending emails and calling is not sufficiënt. You could do more. But that would require people to push the boundaries of the status quo and they are not willing to do that. That was my point. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: I think if you want to regulate layer 1 through 3 of the OSI stack there is no reason to not regulate layer 7.
$C: If the FCC regulates the wires they can regulate what is said over the wires. You are likely too young to remember the "Fairness Doctrine." Which regulated what could be said over the same radio airwaves managed by the FCC. The Fairness Doctrine was also revoked under a republican president, but whatever, ignore history. 
$C: they already do...
$C: /r/news or /r/world news? Those are my two highest karma subs so I'm not sure what you are talking about.
$C: Only a leftist would like to ban an idea that is different than theirs. You hate freedom. It pisses you off!
$C: Wouldn't it be nice if you had a choice of what information you wanted to see on the front page instead of having certain subreddits denied because they disagree with the ideology of the CEO?
$C: The_donald is a circle jerk. You don't go there expecting reasonable discussion.
$C: I'm sorry the truth makes you cringe. Go ahead and vote republican in the future, then. Enjoy not having net neutrality. I have to warn you though, given your post history, a loss of net neutrality will make it so that you can no longer pointlessly troll subreddits where people speak the truth about republicans since the telecom companies can censor those kinds of sites now since the truth goes against their narrative.
$C: [removed]
$C: RIP Snoke.
$C: [removed]
$C: xd
$C: Quit lying to yourself and making false equivalencies. There is a clear vote down party lines on issues like this. Democrats support net neutrality, republicans don't. It's not some vague thing where you can pedal this "both parties are the same" bullshit.
$C: if Alabama can become blue..
$C: Great argument. So typical of a conservative. An issue is clearly divided down party lines with the democrats being on the right side while republicans are clearly in the wrong? The solution is clearly to entrench yourself further in your little safe space while ignoring all the facts.
$C: Never forget /u/Naratto too, for his killing of his sisters boyfriend.
$C: /u/Spez: NN is basically free speech, which we need to protect! (I'll get the exact quote once reddit's servers pull together and let me access his comment history)
 
Also /u/Spez: [Edits, deletes and censors content for disagreeing with him politically]
$C: Muh Freeze Peaches are only important when it hurts your pockets, eh?
$C: /u/Spez: NN is basically free speech, which we need to protect! (I'll get the exact quote once reddit's servers pull together and let me access his comment history)
 
Also /u/Spez: [Edits, deletes and censors content for disagreeing with him politically]
$C: No shit. That's why we voted for a guy who'd end it, since net neutrality sounds like fucking shit for at least half the country.
$C: ... I'm not sure how pointing out Reddit's hypocrisy
$C: I’m guessing 9/10 redditors who voiced outrage on your day to day r/politics or r/news story didn’t contact a representative or stretch their slactivism further than internal rage. And that’s being generous. 

And I think Reddit needs a reality check. This isn’t a community. It’s an entertainment website, a quick fix for that cheap dopamine reward. Maybe Reddit Corp should pay more to distribute. 
$C: This mentality is the problem. There are tons of things you can do in non-violent protest, but none of them get any kind of quick answer and most of them involve actually talking to people and collaborating with strangers face to face. This generation isn't very good at that and their attention span for strife is short enough as it is without being constantly triggered by the next thing we're supposed to be outraged about. 

Sending email and signing online petitions is about as passive as a person can be about an issue but a bunch of people felt empowered by clicking "send." Nobody is willing to actually put themselves out. Everything has to be easy and convenient. It's a shame that actually making a difference is pointedly not those things.
$C: Wait, so like using your wallet to force a company to do something? If only a term to explain that existed. 
$C: YOu think redditors are willing to actually sacrifice anything for their beliefs?
$C: Focusing your anger does fuckall.  Battlefront2 is selling great. 
$C: You had big names, like Google and Facebook. Didn't do you much good since they're both well-known for their opposition to a free and open internet via censorship. 
$C: You and about 200 others. 

Have a cigar. 
$C: I am. Because I can't keep letting them take more from me. If more people would be willing to do it and say no, this would work. So personally, what are you going to do?

Sneaky edit: Username checks out?
$C: \*his mom will pay.
$C: ... really? If my bill goes up one red cent or anything is added on to my bill or taken away from my current plan, I certainly won't be paying.

That's like getting hit in the face and asking for more.  I'm not Jesus, bro. 
$C: They need to put a European flag back drop for every new terrorist attack! 
$C: I know, I know... it's usually only for rich people. But I just thought maybe us poor people could get in on the fun?

$C: I mean it limit the internet access of some low-income household.
$C: I had to have a conversation today with a coworker about what it is and what it means.  It's not going to hit until people start seeing the effects in the upcoming months.
$C:  When does it go into effect?
$C: Was that a surprising number?
$C: I said "nagga" <- (I can't believe you did it again! Jokes on you!) , unless /u/spez used his "joking" admin editing abilities it should still say that.
$C: Damn 👿. How the fuck did that happen
$C: Yes, I understand Obama made really good changes on free internet flow. I just don't understand why is this a big issue?
$C: There's nothing hypothetical about what ISPs will do when net neutrality is eliminated. I'm going to steal a comment previously posted by Skrattybones and repost here:
> 
> 2005 - Madison River Communications was blocking VOIP services. The FCC put a stop to it.
> 
> 2005 - Comcast was denying access to p2p services without notifying customers.
> 
> 2007-2009 - AT&T was having Skype and other VOIPs blocked because they didn't like there was competition for their cellphones.
> 2011 - MetroPCS tried to block all streaming except youtube. (edit: they actually sued the FCC over this)
> 
> 2011-2013, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon were blocking access to Google Wallet because it competed with their bullshit. edit: this one happened literally months after the trio were busted collaborating with Google to block apps from the android marketplace
> 
> 2012, Verizon was demanding google block tethering apps on android because it let owners avoid their $20 tethering fee. This was despite guaranteeing they wouldn't do that as part of a winning bid on an airwaves auction. (edit: they were fined $1.25million over this)
> 
> 2012, AT&T - tried to block access to FaceTime unless customers paid more money.
> 
> 2013, Verizon literally stated that the only thing stopping them from favoring some content providers over other providers were the net neutrality rules in place.
> 
> The foundation of Reason's argument is that Net Neutrality is unnecessary because we've never had issues without it. I think this timeline shows just how crucial it really is to a free and open internet.

Want some examples of how bad it can get?  

* [Here's a screenshot of a cell carrier plan in Mexico, who has no net neutrality laws.](https://imgur.com/yYobj7x)

But if all that doesn't convince you, consider this: TWC owns CNN.  Comcast owns MSNBC.  What makes you think they wouldn't block access to Breitbart and other conservative news sources in favor of their own?  If you really think about it, this is a direct attack on conservatives.  They're targeting you.
$C: It’s our job to make sure our rights are fought for, and preserved. It’s easy to forget and take these things for granted.

We are fighting a war against greedy corporations with the government in their pocket, but we out number them as citizens of the US. We can organize and educate each other and finally put an end to this.

We‘re all soldiers now.
$C: You're wrong. 
$C: The prices have been updated and the pricing is outrageous. Check also the details. For example xfinity offers 10 channels for $40 monthly.
$C: hmmm interesting.....i think i was watching the fcc stream and it cut off
$C: That's not true.

>Until 2015, there were no clear legal protections requiring net neutrality.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States
$C: No it won't affect me because american company's don't follow the American laws and regulations outside of the usa. Virtually no politicians want net neutrality gone here. What is likely to happen is american media companies end up basing in other countries instead.

If anything this is extremely beneficial to Europe because we will likely end up with American businesses here
$C: Exactly what i thought, not to mention shes talking to a highschool class not old enough to vote
$C: Ahh I see. I think my misunderstanding was thinking Google had its own infrastructure. So it relies on the same lines that the other companies use? Well here's hoping they see profit in creating their own independent system, although I'm sure that would take many years.
$C: The vote was 2-1 to remove the FCC's authority to enforce open internet.  It was a completely partisan decision by the (ironically) democratic nominee's to remove Open Internet enforcement from Title I companies.  Either one of those two could have voted the other way and preserved open internet (Verizon vs. FCC) but instead they said corporations must be Title II (and force them under govt control and licensing).  People don't even get this.  People think that "oh the republicans want to take away muh free internet)
rubes

This goes back alot further that I thought, thanks!
$C: THE USER ABOVE IS A MOD AT r/nonetneutrality, and has spammed this message dozens of times pretending to be for net neutrality, presumably because they lead an incredibly sad life. Report and move on.
$C: Telling someone that you will not vote for him is not a threat. It's a fact. A threat that would involve the authorities is a threat on a person's life. Unless you said you would kill the guy if he didn't change his stance, you are ok. She was just being an asshole.
$C: The guy above is a mod at r/nonetneutrality , and has been spamming this message all over this thread. Reddit analytics show he's from Armenia, (and I mean this for the first time in my life) a paid troll. You do the math.
$C: whatever, you missed the point. And you have a strange definition of democracy. Well at least I have better deal with my national Internet provider. Enjoy your "republic" then.
$C: Yes it's quite fustratig watch Americans deal with this kind of situation, and knowing how those lovely chairman's/politics work..

$C: Normal everyday fucktard ^^ 
$C: contra-what? i know the internet isn't free. and how will there be less regulation? won't we be charged for accessing things we already do for free? feel free to enlighten me
$C: I'd really enjoy an all expenses paid vacation to Fiji.
$C: So 2015 was a clarification to keep things as they were? Like "it has always been open and should remain open?"
$C: Clearly it is, the point is it cites specific pages from the actual legislation.  
$C: For example, FCC page 83. It's the direct source about no throttling.

That's not "The_Donald" source. 

$C: I live in New Mexico which across the board ranks one of the lowest SES states in the US, has some of the highest rates of property crime, homelessness, and illicit drug use, with some of the lowest rates of internet accessibility in the country. As of, 2011 "New Mexico ranks next to last of the 50 states and the District of Columbia in prevalence of internet access from the home. The study found that 60.3% of New Mexico households are connected to the internet versus 71.7% of all U.S. households." Since then, our rates of internet access have risen to 80%; however, we still lag behind the national average. This digital divide has been attributed to the concern for affordability when it comes to ISPs. Thus, any further increase in price, that will inevitably come from the FCC revoking net neutrality, will result in the further stunting of accessibility to our state and its residents. 

Additionally, personally, access to information has been pivotal in my education and development as a physician. How can I readily and easily disseminate information to my patients and their families when giving them a life changing diagnosis if they are unable to go home and collect more information for themselves to better their health and lives because they cannot afford to view databases and websites that have important information they need.

$C: When the normies leave we can finally go back to having a good internet
$C: Important to remember who we are talking about here. The world is not free from repercussions, until an action is made, a person needs to be careful about what they say or how they say it.

$C: who the fuck would want it gone
$C: Joke's *really* on you asshole, liking star wars makes you 100% gay.
$C: Not conservatives. A lot of them truly believe that net neutrality is bad.
$C: Your argument is a false equivalency. Democrats don't want to repeal the 2nd amendment. Republicans **do** want to repeal net neutrality though.

>totalitarian

Totalitarianism is an inherently conservative position. If you want to see some totalitarianism look at Trump talking about militarizing the police, legalizing torture, talking about "closing up the internet", and saying he would order the military to kill civilians if necessary.

>gun hating

Stop watching Fox News. It's making you stupid.

>free speech hating

The president of the Republican party, Donald Trump, is one of the most anti-free speech politicians there is. This is the guy who repeatedly said that he wants to "loosen up libel laws" and called for the white house to arrest a guy who criticized him.

You are projecting so hard right now.

>race baiting

Race baiting? You vote for a party full of white supremacists who cannot shutup about mexicans and muslims, and you're going to call *us* race-baiting?

Holy self-awareness.

>virtue signaling

A word assholes use to refer to people who have morals.

> commie scumbag fucks

So is this how you justify the fact that your vote helped ruin the internet? Make stuff up in your head?

Nice coping mechanism.
$C: Cool, its just i only use the Internet for 4 things movies, music, reddit, and porn. And Amazon so I guess 5 things, you got me again world.
$C: Wrong.  NN has existed since the internet was born.  You are sadly misinformed 
$C: It is true.

>Democrats want the US to be the next Soviet Union where the State literally owns everything and individual rights don't exist.

No, they don't. Net neutrality has absolutely nothing to do with government ownership. It's a simple rule that says that ISPs are not allowed to block content and slow down traffic.
$C: Oh no...  Its retarded
$C: I forgot his name and I heard other people call him that. Is he not?
$C: I’m from Poland so what I can do about this shiiiiet? 
$C: Miss the point much?  And I voted for Trump.
$C: U need gas for heating, you need water for drinking and bathing, you need internet for email and YouTube, see the difference? Now I'm not saying internet isn't important and we should protect equal access, but we can also take advantage from privatizing it to our providers. I'm not completely on one side or the other.
$C: Net Neutrality existed before 2015. PLEASE UNDERSTAND THIS FACT!
$C: Perhaps. Still, considering the amount of backlash that sort of thing has been getting, seems a little risky (and almost borderline suicidal) to try and do something like that.

Simply put: They pretty much have two options: Either don't charge for internet services and keep the already steady money-flow from their consumers, or do and enjoy the money flow from that....but now their consumers hate them and possibly end up losing a ton of money from people just bailing out on them in favor of internet providers that DON'T do that.
$C: Tbh same nigga
$C: Just like all of Reddit. Being mad on this website and in echo chamber subreddits has zero effect on the real world. 
$C: Lol k
$C: [removed]
$C: Lol. Alabama voted in a democratic senator.
$C: Absolutely nothing there. It's just showing they're praising the end of net neutrality.

$C: You're not being brigaded. I just sort by controversial because I know where my homies at. Where is the antiNN propaganda even at? Because it damn sure ain't on the "internet's site for authentic conversation" I'll tell you that much. ProNN sentiments are covering this website. Yet we all know that there is another side to that argument. I have yet to see that posted about or discussed on Reddit. Which is literally an anonymous posting site where up votes can be bought. And down votes too for that matter.
$C: [deleted]
$C: You're not being brigaded. You comment is true, but not in the way you think. There's plenty of normal, real people who disagree with you.
$C: >Yeah some got tricked by propaganda.

You mean like all the people who believed the bullshit about small businesses collapsing and needing Net Neutrality to keep companies from becoming monopolies?  As though the FTC doesn't even exist and we will be living in some dystopian future that somehow didn't exist only two years ago before Net Neutrality was enacted.

You're not being brigaded, your comment is just stupid.
$C: Is [this propaganda](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7jlwur/yes_net_neutrality_is_being_stolen_from_us_in_a/dr8a0hv/)?

Some of us read all whopping 83 pages. I know it's hard when there are cat videos to distract you.
$C: Yeah all that anti-net neutrality propaganda!!!

Lmao you are such a dumb ass
$C: >It’s only brigading if it happens to me. 

>MY PRECIOUS KARMA!
$C: I love how you have no idea what a hypocrite you are!
$C: B-b-but I was downvoted.  I must be being brigaded.  

Or you know people don't always have to agree with you.
$C: brigaded by the evil russian bots who stole her turn!
$C: Maybe, but some of us have never, ever supported net neutrality.
$C: i actually can’t belive that people can actually be happy with net neutrality being gone there is no way it affects us as citizens in a positive way these people have to just be misguided
$C: [The big players are seeking the same kind of protection the big TV and Radio providers have via the FCC](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7jlwur/yes_net_neutrality_is_being_stolen_from_us_in_a/dr8a0hv/) - so they don't have to worry about some tiny startup kicking them out of their position.
$C: I don't think the government should have any control over the internet and I think that ISPs should be allowed to act as they please.

Access to the internet isn't a right. 
$C: You can see Russian propaganda here. 

FTFY 
$C: You can easily tell the quality of the arguments form the tone of posts, and damn near every one of them is shitty.

Why would someone who legitimately wants to know what the opposing argument is want to read from a place where nearly every post has a tone that's suspiciously reminiscent of t_d?  It doesn't look like discussion, just derision.
$C: There are dozens of us. 
$C: Thank you.  Subscribed.
$C: Good.
$C: Bring it on
$C: Exactly.

None of those companies (Reddit included) are interested in true neutrality - if they were, they wouldn't ban users over unpopular speech.  They are just interested in making as much money off of the internet as possible.  Net Neutrality makes that easier for them to do while providing almost no protection for the end user.
$C: >Writes on the internet. Says we can't use internet.

Idiots
$C: Well, I'll do both: Fuck you, Pai, and I hope you step on many legos barefooted!
$C: So tolerant and welcoming of a diversity of opinions.
$C: Ooooo, this aggressive xir might beat you with a purple dildo! Literally shaking!!
$C: I disagree with this premise, as td users don’t only use td; The post histories of any of those fucking losers shows that they participate in subs all over reddit.  All having that shit stain of a community around does is give them a safe-space echo chamber to bounce their extremist and decidedly un-American garbage around in, further perpetuating shittier and shittier ideologies by actively censoring anything not parroting the narrative.

You don’t see a whole lot of fatpeoplehate rhetoric around much anymore, and in my opinion that’s due to the fact that the reddit took action against them.

I don’t see a difference here, especially considering the vitriol and fabrications out of whole cloth that are spread by mislead idiots at best and intentionally water-muddying adversarial agents at worst.
$C: Now he is threatening to hunt down people :\ 
$C: How does hunting them down and bringing them to justice constitute a physical threat? LMAO. It's time to get a little more brutal.
$C: And Trumpo made him the chairman, then he led this charge that brought us here today.
$C: He had to choose 2 people that were given to him. It sucks to have to choose 2 piles of shit out of a mountain of it.
$C: Subhuman Trumpmonster spotted.
$C: I️ like you
$C: Despite being ONE OF the members of the commission, at the recommendation of Mitch McConnell, Trump appointed him the HEAD of the FCC, thus sealing the fate of the internet.
$C:  Luke dies. Leia doesn't die. Yoda returns. Snoke dies.
$C: Look at them scurry about.
$C: T_D is over there.
$C: MLK changed the hearts and minds of millions of Americans by not using violence.  By having a principled dream that people are not judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.  And now people like you want us to judge based on the color of a person's skin, ignore the content of their character and use violence.

Sad.
$C: I think you won't be canceling your internet. Good for you.
$C: Mwah.  <3
$C: >giving a fuck about nu-Star Wars
$C: Yeah, it is absurd. The argument that was used to repeal net neutrality sounds pretty good when taken out of context... I want to provide context. When writing letters to my congressmen, I want to provide the context and essentially outline exactly why the "return to light touch regulation" is bullshit.
$C: > BAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

What's that?  Tough to make you out there.
$C: Shit. I need an eli5 for this. Hhh
Anyway well said Cassandra? :)

What knafeh?(I know Arabic :p)

And the FCC won and that's why people should always vote!(to get people they want into Congress) that's why now what got us into this situation.

Net neutrality is no more.

Get ready to pay for everything...
$C: منو انت؟
$C: Only watched the first 3 star wars. Sorry
$C: Not true, the FCC has never been responsible for censorship/monopoly/open internet violations. That is the FTC.
$C: A little desperate, aren't we? Go swing your tiki torch somewhere else.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Violence?
$C: Of course not, and that's why the people keep losing all the time over and over.
$C: You can pass an amendment through the states as well. 
$C: Got it. Thanks for the clarification.
$C: >It's important to always maintain reason and respect

The comments here certainly don't reflect that. I see doxxing information regarding Ajit Pai and comments like "Ajit Pai can choke on a cow dick" which I can only assume is meant to target the fact that he's a first generation immigrant from India where Cows are often regarded as sacred.

Not that I really hold an opinion one way or the other, but the "discussion" being held here is anything but reasonable and respectful.
$C: So then why is such an overwhelming % of this thread full of advocacy of violence acts against Pajit?

What is Reddit's official position on redditors who threaten physical violence against governmental officials?
$C: Thanks for answering my question 
$C: Instant regret for my wish coming true
$C: uhm. Yeah. They gave enough fucks to offer it to me before 2015. 
$C: "Bring only your bodies.... except you, press photographer, you're good.  We need you to document this for our wag-the-dog story about free-internet terrorist sympathizers"
$C: [deleted]
$C: What a fantastic rebuttal, oh enlightened one
$C: It's still a business model. Their model benefits from Net Neutrality and the ISP's model is harmed by it. It is self-interest, they are using you to get what they want against your own interests.
$C: The number won concern of any business is to make money, but the good news for us is that they usually try to make money by providing bigger and better services, especially if they have competition. In theory, if they had better control over their own data, they should offer could offer better services such as cheap HD video over 4g, theres no reason you shouldn't be able to watch TV on your phone just as you watch it at home while paying a minimal rate for Data, unless Data is at a premium because it's all being eaten up by one service which sits in the pipeline like a fatberg.
$C: I’ve been on many lists for a long long time and I still haven’t committed any felonies :)
$C: Well, looks like I’m wrong! Didn’t realize that Pai and one of the other individuals who opposed it were originally nominated by Obama. Shame.
$C: I'm not talking about the ISP's blocking.  I'm talking about the businesses that have what the customers want using their leverage and blocking their customers.  Everyone wants to shop on Amazon and there's no real alternative to Amazon (that's as good).  If their millions of customers that were on comcast couldn't shop there because comcast is being an idiot...think of how many complaints comcast would receive?  Maybe it's a bad idea, but just throwing the thought out there.
$C: No, but if a whole lot of angry people learn it and just so happen to decide to start calling him and otherwise pestering him, his phone would be ringing constantly, which if we are lucky, could be a mild inconvenience or highly annoying
$C: [deleted]
$C: I am against NN.
$C: Comcast charged Netflic because netflix was using huge amounts of comcast resources. 

Should an 18 wheeler pay less than a car on a toll road? Why should a for profit business be given a free ride? 
$C: That's very interesting. But to answer your asinine rhetorical question: no. I don't remember any of those. And each one of these were resolved by the market
 No government control needed. You seem pretty ignorant.
$C: Did you even read what I posted ? You only pointed out the last, title II doesn’t do any of what you said 
$C: Found antifa
$C: Damn
$C: If Comcast makes Hulu faster, that's a violation of anti monopoly laws.

Also, right now it could end up being good for customers, because in the media business, Netflix is the leader by far.
$C: Yes, it is about allowing companies to discriminate against data which will fuck over everyone. If they like allowing companies to discriminate against certain data then they shouldn't mind if Reddit discriminates against them. 
$C: Leading by example is how we got in this situation. Not being tough just if they like the rules so much then we should apply it to them.
$C: It's all about money: They claim to 'save' the internet (when ironically they only kill it more by further consolidating it at the expense of the consumer who pays for their bandwidth) and make themselves look like the heroes, all while footing you with the bill and denying you rights to use their platform because your speech is 'naughty'.

We really need to begin regulating the tech industry, it is toxic
$C: No, the_donald only needs a dumbass 4chan post and believes it automatically.
$C: No. These people are not the brightest. If any women from The_Donald are still here brigading, I have a 9 inch cock. Wait, hold on, pretend I said that on 4Chan.
$C: Hey I saw the contacts too is legit 
$C: it's called "dropping red pills" which basically means you are tasked with making a conspiracy claim by posting a comment, a video by joe schmoe or a conspiracy article written on a word press blog and not really providing credible evidence beyond that

the goal is to get the reader to "follow the rabbit hole" in which they hope you're stupid enough to believe everything you're "researching" (brietbart knock off blogs, 4chan threads, infowars etc)  and then to fall in rank with the rest of them

its easy to do, and afterwards you can just ignore all the replies asking for proof because the burden of proof is magically placed on the reader, not the comment. i'm not entirely sure how they reason why that is, but thats why theres never an attempt to post proof.

edit: there are unsurprisingly a few more examples in this very thread [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7jsyqt/the_fccs_vote_was_predictably_frustrating_but/dr93nhx/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7jsyqt/the_fccs_vote_was_predictably_frustrating_but/dr9004z/)

The Donald is a narrowly focused sub that bans for dissent and is the single most filtered out page for Reddit users. It's users have a tendency to be belligerent, as you've demonstrated for us by calling Spez a nazi.
$C: Lmao. You are spamming this all over Reddit. How lonely can you be? 
$C: THE USER ABOVE IS A MOD AT r/nonetneutrality, and has spammed this message over 40 times pretending to be for net neutrality and violent, presumably because they lead an incredibly sad life, or are paid (redditor for 2 months, random subs, and a mod?).

$C: Because that's the only thing going on, and not a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.

$C: Well, that's not what I think.  Still, this appeal is being made here by the same guy who gives a platform to those who feel as you state.
$C: Triggered?
$C: He can also lick my smelly anus!
$C:  I'm terribly confused that you fucking idiots don't understand Reddit can do whatever the hell he wants with his company. That includes censorship or whatever the fuck else. Reddit is not a government owned operation. Christ, you Politics posters are the snowflakes you constantly whine about.


$C: Nope, I'm just advocating that they get what they want. 
$C: They want corporate censorship, so give it to them. It's not a punishment, merely a taste of what they want to impose on everyone else.
$C: He has kids. 
$C: Fuck off you racist nazi 
$C: Are you some teeny bopper using LOL.  Hahahahaha little turd face you are.  How does donnies asshole taste when you toss his salad? Like McDonalds?  Or Kushners cock? 
$C: people alredy forgetting what he did nice...
$C: lul dont give a fuck about star wars so nice try
$C: Cyka blyat
$C: I know. And I also know that trying to convince anyone of anything is damn near impossible. So instead, I'm simply sharing facts, not opinions, that I don't see others discussing, in the hopes that maybe people will begin to talk amongst themselves and engage in a rigorous debate. :)
$C: You're absolutely right. Here's a fact: no one likes paying more for more of the same. Think we can all agree on that. Here's another fact: Expenses for ISPs have been rising dramatically over the past several years. Why? Because more and more people are using their services and doing things like streaming 4K video and scouring Reddit for new content. So what's the problem? Well...

All these great things that you and I like to do on a daily basis takes bandwidth. Bandwidth is a resource that essentially allows your ISP to provide all this content directly to your connected devices. Why am I telling you this? The issue here is that bandwidth doesn't grow on trees. As Celext said, these companies have to pay to increase their allotment of bandwidth, and that ain't cheap. Unfortunately, what that means for consumers is that the rates for doing the things we enjoy goes up. And there's not a darn thing we can do about it, at least until fiber-optics run beneath every major municipality and township in the country. So here's the takeaway.

Average Joe and Jane who work at your ISP are NOT your enemy. They are humans just like you and I who are doing the very best they know how to provide for themselves and their families. The only real issue at hand here is the underhanded deals that have been made which allow certain providers to maintain federally protected monopolies over large swaths of land and purposefully hike up your rates to line their lobbyists pockets as a result. And all that money comes from YOU. The hard-working men and women of America. That needs to be the discussion here. And right now no one is having it.
$C: Fair enough. I really, really, really hope that everyone here won't allow the left or right to cloud their perception of this issue. It goes much deeper than most of us realize...
$C: nah. i dont blindly believe smth only because its posted in the "correct" sub. if u do that ,fine, but then u are hilarious.
$C: Lol cool
$C: No shit. Rules are in place so us peasants stay peasants. We'd still be a British colony if the founding fathers followed the rules. Given, net neutrality is small change compared to that, but the concept hasn't changed.
$C: i don’t give a fuck about star wars 😂😂
$C: looks like mostly puppet from the leaks
$C: Who are you?  Are you a real person or a bot account?
$C: I guess I found the telecom employee...

You've completely misunderstood my post. I didn't say anything about anyone quitting their job. You're pulling words out of your ass and posting them on the internet. 
$C: Just to be clear, I’m entirely in favor of Net Neutrality. I just think it’s the height of hypocrisy to complain about the loss of Net Neutrality while also aiding and abetting the election of the regime that is instituting it.
$C: Thank you. 

Just curious since the post mentions his name. Had no Idea Serenas husband were a big guy on reddit
$C: What?
$C: Are you trying to say it’s bad for big companies to make more money? That’s ridiculous! That’s the purpose of starting a business and growing it!
$C: Bad bot
$C: ...and designated Chairman by Donald Trump.
$C: Let's see net neutrality under eight years of Obama. Check. Few months of trump. Gone. You do the math genius.
$C: They can't do it to the BBC anyway cause it's already free, so the BBC would have to give permission to put the law in place which I doubt they would give.
$C: he would’ve thought ITS A GOD DAMN DISGRACE
$C: Completely agree, but you just know it's not going to happen. It's like they put something in the food to make the masses more placid and obedient. I just sit back and watch as the whole world goes to shit. Keep fighting the good fight brother. #staywoke 
$C: If nothing will change why are they so desperate to repeal net neutrality? 
$C: **I was a fucking cheesemaker! Now I gotta be a SoLdiEr!!REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!**
$C: True, just trying to think of other ways to send the message. 
$C: It's a bit of a sh!t hole now. It's so separated
$C: Because so much of reddit is hardcore leftwing they are nazi enabling. These people want socialism for the entire nation: national socialism. We need to stop them before they start gassing the whites.
$C: They're related because they both involve private corporations discriminating against certain content, and I was saying it was hypocritical that reddit (the corporation) would support net neutrality while censoring subreddits, editing user comments, etc. Also, internet service providers are privately owned corporations too.
$C: Enjoy your top keks while you can, my friend.

Soon you'll be paying extra to post your memes in the fast lane :)
$C: Thanks bot
$C: Okay, but explain how so? 
$C: I used the internet in 2014.
$C: Nah.
$C: If Redditors are graded on effort then most of us fail.
$C: Hillary would never have made Pai chairman like Trump did
$C: Net neutrality allows the government to have control over the businesses that can offer internet services. While this artificially may lower the price for a bit, in the long run we are making it more expensive than it could have been if the free market was allowed to control it. (More companies could compete and overall prices would be driven lower to allow the consumer to use their product.) This is the reason why we have seen no improvement in our internet speeds/quality because companies have no incentive to provide better services. The people that are lobbying for this to be repealed are those that can afford to compete with monopolies like Comcast. This policy is an example of the government artificially propping up a monopoly. If you like having very few competitors to choose from when it comes to your internet services then by all means feel free to support the fight for net neutrality. I however envision a world where I can choose from a bunch of companies and decide which is the product for me.
$C: No offense to you but I'm getting kind of tired of explaining it to people, so in a somewhat brief sense - for one this allows the government to control what private ISP companies do, where private companies are supposed to be able to control their own services. And when some people claim that ISPs can now charge for websites, it won't happen. It'll go back to exactly how it was from 1990 to 2015 where the FTC will monitor any unfair regulations that companies try to sneak out, and financially penalize them if they do. 
$C: Get with the groupthink, fellow redditor!
$C: Read my response to warclannubs. 
$C: At this point I don't think there is any way to correct these people. If they are that simple minded to think giving control of the internet to corporations is "opening the internet" then all hope is lost for them to use any kind of logic. 
$C: To be fair, when you are dealing with a good/utility/service that crosses state boundaries you do need a unified set of standards and rules enforced by a federal power. Especially with something like the internet, it would be a nightmare having different standards and policies state by state. 
$C: It’s called get another provider. Free market will provide. Motherfucker....
$C: The thing is with neutrality gone the smaller providers will be able to expand as they will have less restrictions that are handled with ease from the bigger companies but slow the smaller ones down. While some people are forced to one company, many have a choice between even smaller providers. The competition will increase and with mass complaining about the existing "monopolies" it could kill the big 2 right now and give birth to new providers that could benefit the consumers. The government fight is futile at this point. We need to change the industry as consumers.
$C: While with the current state of companies the law actually benefits Comcast and att as the smaller companies can't keep up with all the regulations as easily as the big ones and in result net neutrality will kill competition. I am a firm believer of the open internet but at this point fighting the politicians would be a losing battle, as it already has been, despite mass support. We as an internet community need to fight the problem from the source. Net neutrality gone isnt the whole problem, the big companies are big factor in this as well.
$C: I hate that you have to be so toxic about this. We are on the same side, just with different opinions on how the matter should be solved. 

I do want to say that if the government is supposed to be a mediator, it clearly has not done a very good job of it. We can keep bothering them, but I'm sure they will be getting paid more just to ignore us and vote one party.

Also we could have a whole theoretical debate on wether or not regulations are good or bad, and it would go nowhere as political debates typically do, so let's not get into that. 

In addition, the entirety of net neutrality isn't all bad, it promotes competition in the industry and can actually allow more smaller local providers with decent service to flourish as they won't have to worry about regulations that are currently handled with ease by the big corporations with money to blow on people who can make an educated decision for them with lawyers and such. With the current isp  system in place the repeal can hurt the consumer, but if we change with industry as consumers and entrepreneurs it might not be the end of a good internet environment. 

Also if you are going to be toxic you might as well not reply all, I'm just here for a civil discussion on the issue. And maybe we can both learn something on the way.
$C: >8 Hours Later

$C: Who are you to tell me what my self interest is?

$C: Not an argument.
$C: Government control is dangerous. That's why I'm against NN
$C: Can you tell me what ISPs have done to censor me more than social media has? Let's look at precedent here: the people who destroyed free expression on the internet are the ones telling us that net neutrality will save free speech, and not only that, the internet WAS freer prior to the Obama administration. This is a FACT. This is REALITY.

It's not non-existent monopolies doing this. A certain segment of the population has become violently against free speech, and they're also the ones demanding net neutrality. And that is enough of a reason to take a second look on how good NN supposedly has been.
$C: Net Mentality ***IS*** government control ...

$C: All three. And if his subs got banned, probably a hatemonger.
$C: Look at his post history. It's clear he is deeply disturbed and has supported hate-speech subreddits, but it's never these people's faults. Why go through life with so much hate.

$C: You need to leave the echo chamber once in a while:

$C: You know who I am, right?
$C: > I don't know what planet you come from or what youre standing for here, but I also don't care. You just sound salty that your edgey subreddits didn't do better.

So you are admitting to being for censorship, it just depends on who is getting censored? In fact, you WANT censorship -- you just don't want people to have the ability to do it to you.

I see.
$C: How is this the case? Have you heard of Aaron Swartz before? He got arrested for liberating taxpayer funded academic journals and committed suicide. Afterwards, Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian have tried to rewrite history into claiming Aaron wasn't a founder: they had even removed him from the reddit admin allumni page in Soviet style erasing.

https://web.archive.org/web/20121031001358/https://www.reddit.com/about/team/

No "aaronsw"

Do you really believe that's what net neutrality is going to give you? Because these people claim one thing then do the exact opposite.
$C: That's already happening, dailystormer is the best example (I don't like them and weev has called me a "filthy [jew] lover in the past) I can think of. Stormfront was as well and I don't even think they had anything to do with UTR as that demographic is a bunch of weird old illiterate people long past relevancy. I'm already mostly censored off of reddit.

> What if someone like you or me wants to make a site for right leaning demographic?

After coontown got banned we tried this and it got DDOS'd. None of us had a lot of time or money so we had to cancel the project. I was censored through illegal means, and that will happen if you're run off of the centralized internet. So the "start your own website" argument doesn't hold up because you'll be censored on that route too.
$C: /r/coontown was my best product.
$C: Didn't this website advertise itself as a "bastion of free speech."

Yes or no?
$C: > Private companies can give you the boot all they want, for any or no reason.

And ISPs are private companies. 

HOORAY! YOU GET WHY no-NN is good!
$C: You mean here come the pretzels!
$C: >FCC != “Trump and government”.

Uhh FCC = Trump-controlled government organization, so your equation is flawed
$C: Nah, just a degenerate.
$C: Lol Republicans can't even win in Alabama anymore
$C: Nothing tolerant about it. Just facts. Nn is dead unless someone changes the votes. That won't happen so stupid the tie breaking vote is the only way. 
$C: How else could this have been stopped in the last two hours? 
$C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KquFZYi6L0
$C: Project harder
$C: >you wanted a women as president so badly 

no, i just wanted 1) a Democrat and 2) a not Trump. simple as that.
$C: i'll blame them for being ignorant and ushering in this craptacular FCC then. It's still the fault of idiots in swing states who bought into right wing conspiracy theories and just couldn't vote for Hillary cause she wanted to drone Assange, or cause she supports pizza parlor pedophiel rings, or whatever other dumb shit they convinced themselves of. 
$C: >Don’t blame people for voting for a candidate they believed in.

Sorry, but if you didn't vote for Hillary last November then all you did was help Trump get elected that let him appoint Ajit Pai as FCC chairman.  Hillary promised to protect Net Neutrality, Trump was against Net Neutrality.
$C: Redditlist.com > recent activity.

It's third most active, my bad.
$C: A lot of people do though.
$C: go back in your basement you conspiracy cunt
$C: This is a very good thing. Before you disregard my comment, know that the government has ISPs heavily regulated. By reclassifying them they are breaking up monopolies that they [gov] formed. Companies will be rewarded with profit and customers by creating the internet as fast and accessable as possible.
$C: The service providers have the right to. The government is not an ISP, so what gives them the right to meddle with our internet. I love the internet, that's why I am anti net neutrality.
$C: Muh Russia! 
$C: **AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!**

**THIS CENSORED SHITHOLE DIDN'T GET WHAT THEY WANTED!**
$C: Net Neutrality is supposed to protect customers from corporate customer-predatory practices, which is exactly what Spez does on Reddit.
$C: Same.
$C: The only argument I've seen is "They're going to throttle mah internetz!" No research into the actual law, no regards to how it was regulated before NN, nothing besides the same parroted screeching. 

They can feel free hate me because I'm against socialist policies, but people freaking out when they don't understand why is nothing more than needless hysteria. They'll move on and see the world isn't ending, I hope the downvotes make them feel better and get it out of their system.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Not your personal army. But I hate to tell you all those same guys from a decade ago are most likely on the conservative side these days. People who hate censorship tend to lean that way these days the same way they did 10 years ago. 
$C: Well I’m not liberal but thanks. 
$C: I mean, coming from a party that supports child molesters, I am not really offended.
$C: Tell me about your emotions. Are you angry? Upset?
$C: THE USER ABOVE IS A MOD AT r/nonetneutrality, and has spammed this message over 40 times pretending to be for net neutrality and violent, presumably because they lead an incredibly sad life, or are paid (redditor for 2 months, random subs, and a mod?). Report, and be aware that these people exist.
$C: Read a book.   Professor Thomas Hazlett - The Political Spectrum.
$C: I just think it's inappropriate to declare defeat until it's actually been done.
$C: Thx. Off to start a gofundme page.... Nuts. I'm going to have to find money to get there first.
$C: Not succuming to brainwashing false propoganda from teenagers who call in bomb threats.
$C: I’m not sure it’s the corporate democrats doing, this just plain isn’t their lobby. Ajit Pai has become a sort of scapegoat for the GOP, that’s what I’ve gathered from seeing his face plastered everywhere, instead of the faces of politicians that we actually get to vote for.
$C: I’ll explain for you, then. Though he was already a commissioner, he was designated chairman of the FCC by Trump in January, when net neutrality actually became a known issue by the general public. He was appointed by Obama when there was no talk of a vote on net neutrality, and also, Obama had to pick someone that would get confirmed by a republican-majority senate: Ajit Pai.
$C: The sub that is censored and suppressed on this site? What’s that about net neutrality?
$C: ahhh yes, the mythical "corporate overlords". i love how people think corporations are the evil ones while pushing for socialist agendas when it is responsible for the deaths of over 300 million people. yeah, i think i'd rather give the corporate overlords a try than a tyrannical government. thanks though. this is great news!
$C: Because hopefully isps charge for reddit thus less liberals visit
$C: No I didn't. You don't even know the so-called benefits of Net Neutrality, except that you think the well-marketed name 'net neutrality' is worthy of the cause itself, and that Spez told you *"muh free speech"* and "*they're gonna tewk muh internetz"*.

I'm sick and fucking tired of paying for Google's endless expansion. Aren't you?
$C: Meaning we maybe won't have the slowest internet speeds in the world much longer once we break up the monopolies like google 
$C: we have to destroy the syndicate
$C: At the expense of consumers. Socialized internet is over. The free market is now open. Title 2 is gone. 
$C: your tears are delicious

$C: It's the opposite of it's name sake. Nn allowed the technical oligarchs to control what they want by classifying themselves as neutral.  Now they no longer have those protections. Now they can't screw the consumer because they claim neutrality.
$C: Not just him,  any 1 percenter who wants to benefit off the suffering of the poor. If you think its 4 $ than i dont know what planet you fucking live on.  They could Jack it up 4 bucks whenever they want.  Infact its very common for isp's to double your bill after a year of service. I asked where to train as an assassin,  not for your dumb morals.
$C: >Uh...

Breath with your damn mouth closed.

>Uh...im not really sure how paying for internet is "freeloading". 

You think it's fair that Google and Reddit pay the same price for bandwidth despite commanding 90% of the ad market? Funny how your lot are in favour of a progressive tax, but not on a progressive pay scale for people who consume massive amounts o bandwidth compared to others.

>You literally just cheered for yourself being fucked

Not sure how.

>and called yourself a freeloader. 

Not sure how.

>You don't think too good, do you?

Not sure how.
$C: False.
$C: Can you elaborate?
$C: Did you REEEEEEEEEEE about it enough?
$C: Fingers crossed it goes through then. 
$C: If you're right, us premium users won't be seeing it anymore, because you won't be able to afford the internet.
$C: Well that's not how it worked before and it's not how it's going to work now, so you can stop peddling that garbage.

Thank God the tyranny of the holy government has been further curtailed. Net Neutrality was a cancer.

Edit: when did the "left" start giving a shit about freedom of expression?
$C: Good thing I don't pay for my internet!
$C: This is a breakdown, it is not mine but is insanely relevant:

**Terms You Need to Know:**

- Title II / Common Carrier / "Net Neutrality" = internet becomes gov't utility = Obamanet = **not good**

- FTC Regulation = no monopolies (comcast), no price-fixing, no unfair shit = **good**

- Open Internet Rules / Bright Line Rules = no throttling, no blocking, no paid-priority = **very good**

**Timeline You Need to Know**

- [2005 Open Internet](https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-05-151A1.pdf) announced as FCC policy (by Republican chairman). Internet still so new, not much for FCC to really do.

- [2010 Open Internet Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States#FCC_Open_Internet_Order_.282010.29) = Open Internet Rules (aka Bright Line) specified (good)

- [2014 *Verizon v. FCC*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications_Inc._v._FCC_(2014) prevents FCC from enforcing Open Internet Rules unless it *also* enforces Title II (big gov't comes in and literally makes the internet its utility) &lt;&lt;wtf,why??? fun fact **the two judges who fucked open-internet were appointed by clinton**, the third dissenter was reagan

- 2015 Net Neutrality (pushed by Obama) = Open Internet Rules (renamed to Bright Line) (good) + Title II Utility Classification (BAD)

- 2017 Net Neutrality Repeal = FTC Regulations (good) + no Title II (good) + no Open Internet Rules (bad) '(

**The reason Obama's 2015 Net Neutrality is bad** isn't because it includes the Open Internet Rules (created in 2005), but because it includes the Title II Utility Classification of the internet. AND- get this- the Open Internet Rules are only included *provisionally*, UNDER Title II. This basically says "hey all ur free speech is only allowed if big gov't gets to turn the internet into its utility". Umm what? 2015 Net Neutrality was advertised as being equal to the Open Internet Rules, but Open Internet had already been an FCC policy since 2005. Obama pressured the FCC to repackage the 2010 Open Internet Order under a Title II Utility Classification of the internet. This is what we oppose. 

# Everyone here agrees that ISPs should not throttle/paywall/censor/restrict our content. Period. End of story. ISPs are notoriously shady, but [here are some reassurances the FCC has given us:](https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db1122/DOC-347927A1.pdf)

# FTC Privacy Regulation, sec.177

&gt;  Restoring FTC [Federal Trade Commission] jurisdiction over ISPs will enable the FTC to apply its extensive privacy and data security expertise to provide the uniform online privacy protections that consumers expect and deserve.^651

# *Direct quote from the homies: No throttling.* [FCC release, p.83](https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db1122/DOC-347927A1.pdf)

&gt; 142.  Many of the largest ISPs (Comcast, AT&amp;T, Verizon, Cox, Frontier, etc.) have committed in this proceeding **not to block or throttle legal content**.^507 These **commitments can be enforced** by the FTC  under Section 5, protecting consumers without imposing public-utility regulation on ISPs.^508


# b-but im an ISP I don't wanna be transparent I just wanna bait-and-switch my customers while they watch **intergalactic bdsm porn** SORRY HUNNY U GETTN REGULATED (FCC release p.82):

&gt;  The FTC’s unfair-and-deceptive-practices authority “prohibits companies from selling consumers one product or service but providing them something different,” which makes voluntary commitments enforceable.^502 The FTC also requires the “disclos[ur]e [of] material information if not disclosing it would mislead the consumer,” so if an ISP “failed to disclose blocking, throttling, or other practices that would matter to a reasonable consumer, the FTC’s deception authority would apply.”^503

# Conspiracy theorists put down your pitch-forks, ISPs cannot conspire. (FCC invokes Sherman Act Antitrust Laws, Section 144, p.85, FCC release)

&gt; 144. Section 1 of the Sherman Act bars contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade, making anticompetitive arrangements illegal.  If ISPs reached agreements to unfairly block, throttle, or discriminate against Internet conduct or applications, these agreements would be per seillegal under the antitrust laws.^518

# ***UNLIMITED NETFLIXXX, [UNCENSORED EDITION] ***

&gt;  If an ISP that also sells video services degrades the speed or quality of competing “Over the Top” video services (such as Netflix),^526 that conduct could be challenged as anti competitive foreclosure.

&gt; 161. We also conclude that the Commission should have been cautioned against reclassifying broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service in 2015 because doing so involved “laying claim to **extravagant statutory power over the national economy** ..."


# AT&amp;T got uppity, tried to slide a fat &amp; nasty nude into America's DMs and the FCC said ***behave yourself hunny***. FCC now reserves the right to return to Title II (Obama Net Neutrality) regulations if ISP fuckers get uppity. 

&gt; 176.We also reject AT&amp;T’s assertion that the Commission should conditionally forbear from all Title II regulations as a preventive measure to address the contingency that a future Commission might seek to reinstate the Title II Order.^647  Although AT&amp;T explains that “conditional forbearance would provide an extra level of **insurance against the contingency that a future, politically motivated Commission might try to reinstate a ‘common carrier’ classification [2015 Net Neutrality Regulations]**,”^648 we see no need to address the complicated question of prophylactic forbearance and find **such extraordinary measures [are] unnecessary.**
 
# And finally, the cherry-on-top.

&gt; Should the hypothetical harms that proponents of Title II imagine eventually come to pass, application of the antitrust laws would address those harms.

#TLDR

- Regulatory ~~rollback~~ throwback to 90's.

- FCC claims the 2015 Regulations gave the government "extravagant statutory power over the national economy".

- Regulatory oversight of the ISP now includes the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) as it was in the 1990's. Unlike the FCC, they can fuck Comcast for being a monopoly (which they are allowed to be if they're a utility).

- FCC is enforcing against throttling, censorship, restriction, etc. by invoking consumer protection and anti-trust laws (via FTC).

- If ISPs collectively conspire to paywall a content-provider, they are subject to FTC anti-trust penetration.

- FCC repeatedly acknowledges that its new policy is deliberately business-friendly in hopes to increase competition in the market so that Comcast isn't the only fucking one. FCC acknowledges that potential abuse of this friendliness will result in stricter policy. 

- America has some of the shittiest internet in the world because our infrastructure is antiquated and fiber-optic trenching projects keep getting killed. Title-II strangles investments, but this repeal attracts it. Better infrastructure means faster speeds and cheaper service. **#Pray4FiberOptic**

- Remember all the Congressmen who wanted to sell out our personal information earlier this year? This FCC repeal will block that, because of FTC consumer privacy protection regulations don't allow it.


# **How this may negatively affect you:** 

The major loophole lies here:

&gt;Many of the largest ISPs have **committed** to not to block or throttle legal content.^507 These commitments **can** be enforced by the FTC...

FTC prevents throtting/blocking/etc because that's what ISPs are advertising, and they must be held accountable. If multiple ISPs each individually stop advertising it, it's not *immediately* clear that the FTC can hold them all accountable to it. However, if the ISPs collude to collectively enact abusive policies, then the FTC can fuck them up. Further, if an ISP paywalls websites, they must explicitly notify consumers. **If customers have no alternative ISP and are forced to obey their one ISP's abusive policies, then the FTC can declare them a monopoly.** That would whip up a shitstorm for the ISP, but it could still happen.

Later in the report the FCC admits that they have to eliminate the Open Internet Rules, which is bad for us. The FCC was forced to do this because of the two **Democrat** judges in the D.C. Circuit who presided over *Verizon v. FCC* and ruled that the FCC is no longer allowed to enforce open-internet **unless they force the ISPs to become Title II Utilities.**

**The Democrat judges admitted that they were**

&gt; **...not to assess the wisdom of the Open Internet Order regulations**, but rather to determine whether the Commission has demonstrated that the regulations fall within the scope of its statutory grant of authority."

These two judges were appointed by Bill Clinton. Almost sounds like he paid them a visit on the tarmac. 

# [FCC Bright-Line / Open Internet Rules](http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db0312/FCC-15-24A1.pdf)

- No Blocking

- No Throttling

- No Paid-Prioritization 

The FCC Bright Line Rules are replaced with FTC regulations:

- No monopolies. (lookin at you comcast)

- No collusion. (still lookin at you)

- No consumer abuse 

- No unfair business practice. (holy fuck comcast)


$C: 
Cont'd

**The report clarifies that the repeal of FCC Bright Line does not inhibit the FTC from enforcing an open internet, and regulation enforcement is delegated to the FTC heretofore. (FTC has a good record protecting consumers).**

&gt; In the unlikely event that ISPs engage in conduct that **harms Internet openness**, despite the paucity of evidence of such incidents, we find that utility-style regulation is unnecessary to address such conduct.  Other legal regimes—particularly antitrust law and the FTC’s authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act to prohibit unfair and deceptive practices—provide protection for consumers.

The FCC admits that this has the potential to become a problem. They claim it is highly unlikely because the FTC can come in and penetrate ISPs who act as monopolies. Plus, content providers (Google, Amazon, etc.) have an obscenely higher market capitalization than ISP's (Google alone has higher market cap than all ISP's combined), and that they can easily pressure ISPs to obey. 

For example:

- Comcast tries to throttle Netflix. 

- Netflix says fuck you we won't serve any of your Comcast kind here. 

- Comcast customers can't watch Stranger Things.

- Comcast customers screech autistically.

-  Everyone (who can) leaves Comcast.

- If nobody can leave Comcast, the FTC can declare Comcast a monopoly and bust their nuts. This nut busting can legally bind Comcast to their past promises of Open Internet, since there are no competitors keeping them incheck.  

Thus the FCC concludes it is unlikely that ISPs will paywall their content providers because content-providers will easily prevent them from doing it. FCC asserts that monopolies like Comcast will be combated with FTC anti-monopoly regulation, increased competition, and more ISP choices for customers that will drive price down and quality up. FCC will address individual ISP violations case by case if/when they arise. 

&gt;141. Consumer Protection.  The FTC has broad authority to protect consumers from “unfair or deceptive acts or practices.”^495

**I can't imagine anything more unfair than Comcast monopolizing your internet.**

**Timeline Review**

- [2005 Open Internet](https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-05-151A1.pdf) announced as FCC policy by the then Republican chairman.

- [2010 Open Internet Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States#FCC_Open_Internet_Order_.282010.29) = Open Internet Rules (aka Bright Line) **(good)**

- [2014 *Verizon v. FCC*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications_Inc._v._FCC_(2014) D.C. Circuit of Appeals (aka the swamp) prevents FCC from enforcing Open Internet Rules unless it *also* enforces Title II (big gov't comes in and literally makes the internet its utility) &lt;&lt;wtf,why??? Fun Fact: these two judges who fucked the internet were appointed by Clinton (I wonder if they had a tarmac meeting to talk about their kids' internet usage). The third judge who tried to stop it was a Reagan man. 

- 2015 Net Neutrality (pushed by Obama) = Open Internet Rules (renamed to Bright Line) (good) + Title II Utility Classification **(BAD)**

- 2017 Net Neutrality Repeal = FTC Regulations (good) + no Title II (good) + no Open Internet Rules  :'(

# Conclusion

The FCC couldn't have done any more for Open-Internet, thanks to Bill Clinton's judges in the D.C. Circuit strangling the shit out of the FCC's jurisdiction. They said "make the internet a utility or end Open-Internet". Instead of caving in to either of those demands, the FCC did a brilliant end-run around the judges by bringing the FTC in to do what the FCC no longer can. This will prevent blocking and throttling, and it'll be the first time they've attacked ISP monopolization (Comcast)! Unfortunately, the possibility still exists that paid-prioritization (bundling internet packages by speed) will emerge in the future, especially if the FTC fails to crack down on monopolies like Comcast, and/or if the markets fail to produce enough competitors to the existing ISPs. Keep your eyes open and stay vigilant.
$C: If you're not black you are not capable of understanding the black experience, or the black struggle.
$C: Yes. I know that Net Neutrality did not solve any of the problems that we had with the internet.   

ISPs with net neutrality can inject code, Google can hide problematic results, YouTube can ban the Right, Facebook can curate what you see and Twitter can do whatever.      

We will continue to have defacto monopolies curated by local governments on the take and customers will just have to take what is offered.   


The only thing that can not happen is TWC can not under any circumstance work out a deal with Facebook so that they can give you access to it and not have it count against your data caps.    

Because that is evil.
$C: 1. Not everyone shares you opinions, that doesn’t make them a troll 

2. Your site immediately redirected me to a “FREE IPHONE GIVEAWAY” site, so fuck off with it
$C: His job is to get in trouble with attorney state generals? Huh! Last I checked Pai's job is to polish my fat fucking knob with his mouth
$C: Dude, stop being a tool for big corps. WE NEVER HAD NN BEFORE 2015. And thats when the internet was GOOD. Now with NN we have 100% conservative politics censorship. Yeah no thanks, GOOD BY NN/CENSORSHIP!!!
$C: Tell me when r/the_donald can hit r/popular 
$C: >according to the Verge

And into the trash it goes. 

$C: And I have no obligation to give a shit or even believe them when they get butthurt because of hysteria that the government is about to return the favor. That's the rub about censoring things you don't like, people tend to stop believing you.
$C: So people like spez cant destroy a website single handedly.

$C: [We are actually....](http://i.imgur.com/lseZT8r.jpg)
$C: Nothing justifies calling in a bomb threat simply because you're not getting your way.

It's a temper tantrum of the utmost height.
$C: mad :3
$C: A bunch of things that haven't even happened: the post


Tired of fear mongering faggots crying every time some government regulation is put away.  A year will go by after this and you'll still be posting the same stupid shit and nothing will change.
$C: "before 2015 every website had a surcharge"
$C: I'm surprised people took my message seriously and didn't see that I was mocking those that were enjoying the "liberal tears".
$C: Whats David brocks greasy dick taste like?
$C: Net neutrality didn't exist before 2015, but the problems you are describing also didn't exist before then. Why should we have burdensome regulations that stifle growth and innovation for a problem that doesn't exist?
$C: They already can do that....Page 15-16 of the current net neutrality agreement. They just have to tell you upfront about it and the reason why nobody does it is everyone would change isp to someone who doesn't throttle. The internet should not be controlled by anyone. I'm willing to bet $100 of btc that they don't throttle my internet. 
$C: "Proven" is a word stupid people use when they're not smart enough to make an argument in an ambiguous situation. Similar to "debunked".

From your article:

> Supporters claim these examples only bolster their argument, because in each case the FTC or another entity stepped in to correct the company, **which is true**

So they agree, each time there has been a problem, the FTC has stepped in and fixed it.

I mean, just think about the lack of critical thinking and reason it takes to use "proven" in the same sentence as "adequate". "Adequate" is obviously subjective. "Proven" is (trying to be) objective.

Whether or not it has a "proven track record of not being able to adequately regulate the internet" is entirely based on your definition of 'adequate'.

The obvious answer to all of this is that we need a legislative solution. That this is difficult to achieve in a polarized country is a deliberate feature of our system of government, whether you like that or not.
$C: No. I want massive corporations that use more bandwidth to pay their fair share. Not the same rates that my website that I created in ‘99 pays
$C: The people I see being led here are people like yourself and the rest of the reddit hivemind
$C: No, I understand it just fine.

You realize that Net Neutrality forces ISPs to treat to big companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, facebook, and twitter as customers on the same footing as you, right?

Why do you think all those companies say they support Net Neutrality? Because it benefits them you dummie

$C: it's not up to our government to be in control. up to the free market. today will be a glorious vote!! i can't wait. 
$C: Brainwashed levels off the charts. 
$C: i'm guessing you're not a small ISP owner or know anyone who is. get educated. please. 
$C: right. and it was properly taken care of by the FTC. 
$C: i'm fully aware of NN and pre NN. i'm a small ISP business owner. 
$C: tell me. if the FCC had overbearing rules and regulations over telephones and telephones services, would we have the iphone today?
$C: Just because you are a nobody kid living in your mom’s basement, nearest to the only pussy you will ever see, doesn’t mean you have the right to tell someone to go and off themselves for supporting the  opposing side of an argument, without consequences. Realize how mentally unstable you are to feel comfortable saying such things and develop some control and self worth. 
$C: my body is ready. 
$C: Move. Quit forcing reality to bend to your selfish needs. Create a competitor. Entitled States of America.
$C: No cell phone towers? No faith in development of new satellite technologies for internet? No innovation?

Meanwhile, Youtube and Amazon Prime are now going to have to charge a subscription or ads to pay for their service...oh wait..they do that now.

So what changed?

$C: Most people lived their entire lives without ever having to use the internet and did fine. 👶🏻🍼
$C: Or move. Nobody is forcing you to live where you do, but you.
$C: It's like they have never heard of lobbyists and crony Capitalism. Don't most of these people cry about Lobbyists infiltrating politics during elections? It's mind boggling how much trust they have for the same Government that hands out corporate bailouts and lies about everything under the sun.
$C: Lmao except they don't. In fact Disney is buying up Most of Fox. Regulations only hurt small businesses because they are often written by Big Corporations who pay millions for lobbying. You sound like a bootlicker.
$C: sounds like NERD shit to me
$C: Actually considering the 1934 was written for an outdated tech and governs anonymity, lewdness, and harassing speech in its scope getting rid of it is a win.  Under title ii, Anything anonymous can be construed harassing (your response was anonymous, i might consider it harrassing), and anything that can be construed as harassing can be used to silence speech, if not at the user level at the isp or dns level.

You never read the law and you dont know what you are talking about.  Net neutrality, while protected by title ii status, was not the only effect of the classification, it is just the only one you are hearing about.  The other effects are far more detrimental to speech and open communication on the internet.  That and it could destroy all the free amateur porn.


$C: Vote manipulation, the sub says there are 500,000 subscribers but Spez was telling his advertisers there were millions of subscribers so which is it?, Spez has admitted to changing and deleting comments there before. 
$C: Spez is a trendy faggot at the helm of a huge, influential company. /r/politics was bought by the Hillary campaign, and he is 100% privy to that information and most likely benefited from it.
$C: fucking lulz. okay. 
$C: Corporations will never control the internet. They just have the most efficient infrastructure for it, which they lease to us.

Government however could control the internet, and that would be the opposite of freedom. Luckily the government is giving up some of that control.

You have no moral right whatsoever.
$C: [deleted]
$C: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=communist+hand+symbol&t=ddg_android_hs&iax=images&ia=images

At least just click the link and decide for yourself
$C: Haha. You deserve as much freedom as the person you would strip of it. /u/spez is a hypocrite, and was directly cited as a reason that the whole "Free and open internet" talking-point had lost argumentative value. I'm a random idiot on the internet. Who do you think bears more responsibility for this outcome?

I get that you're happy reddit silences/suppresses opinions that differs from you own: You people make it perfectly clear you're happy about it.

But let's not pretend there was never going to be consequences for it. 
$C: Sigh. You either didn't read or didn't comprehend what I wrote.

"Net Neutrality" as a regulation has no political component. "Support for Net Neutrality" is a political position. And support of that position could have been stronger if the advocates for it weren't so hostile towards conservatives. 

Reddit was specifically called out by the FCC as devaluing the argument about freeness and openness of a website. You look kind of silly begging for a "Free and Open Internet" while simultaneously subverting people you politically disagree with.

Reddit has no obligation to be fair to conservatives (and they aren't). 

And conservatives have no obligation to answer Reddit/Google/Facebook's rallying cry (and they mostly didn't).

Maybe more people would have answered the call if they didn't feel so maligned by the people asking for help.

That easier to understand?
$C: It does. Prior to 2015 websites were not engaging in the mass censorship of "wrong" viewpoints they are engaging in today.
$C: https://gyazo.com/40e3b7e2985335b8647931faa18b84d8
$C: I dont know about you but i was on the internet just as much pre 2015 as i am now and it was not some armageddon that all the shills are promising will happen now that its gone again. Stop echoing big silicon valley companies who are only in it for themselves. 
$C: Treating all information the same. Spez has admitted to altering this information, and actively censoring information (lying about subs on T_D, blocking T_D from r/all). 

So he can keep pretending to be pro NN, but I will wait for his actions to show this.
$C: Nop. Is gonna be fine :D 
$C: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHA SO DELICIOUS!!!! SO MAD!!
$C: Almost like Reddit would get shafted by this and not the consumer, hence the outrageous amount of astro-turfing and shilling for it on this site 
$C: So you're fine with censorship of opinions you do not agree with? Confirms my bias of the left. Thank you.
$C: Every President makes appointments and does all kinds of shit I disagree with.

Not every website slides the cable media directly into my ass, and then turns around telling me to be scared of the FCC sliding the cable media directly into my ass.

The hypocrisy here actually *softens* my position in favor of network neutrality. What is the point of network neutrality if we're going to let this shithole, via marketers running wild, "aggregate" the media we watch and dictate consensus anyway?
$C: what the fight was really about. stay clueless cuck
$C: nope, perfectly sane. the opposite just happened. 
$C: Funny how you begin a conversation calling me retarded. 
$C: For example, Tom Fitton from Judicial Watch, a very important watchdog group, was shadowbanned the other day: https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7jlicg/unbelievable_tom_fitton_is_silenced_in_his_own/

Youtube, Twitter and Facebook also are known to remove content they don't like, and when pressed will say "It scares away advertisers". Why doesn't reddit care about this kind of corporate censorship which is unaffected by NN? "It's their website, they can ban anyone they want" doesn't sound like a commitment to a free and open Internet to me.
$C: That's The_Donald you're thinking of buddy
$C: lol typical liberal, cant imagine that conservatives actually exist in america, so you assume im a russian bot. lol kek i dont even care
$C: Nope I look at this logically, right now this thread is just a downvote party for anyone with common sense
$C: No, this has to with regarding bandwidth that the ISPs must provide to sustain connection speeds with certain sites.
$C: Salon.com ran articles defending pedophilia, salon.com is not a conservative outlet.

I'm not com a bother debating you on how wrong you are, because regardless, opinions you don't like don't deserve censorship.

Which is already happening without an end to net neutrality.
$C: I have a bachelor's in comp sci. I'm working in software development.  I'm not tech illiterate and I support the end of nn, because I actually read the 200 page doc, and saw that ending it is where the consumer protections are.
$C: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA  You're a fucking moron without a clue.  No offense.
$C: Ride the snake.
$C: Your downvotes sustain me.
$C: Ahahahahahahah stay salty, you got played by Reddit and thankfully our government doesn’t decide based off of what dumb ass 12 year old kids think they want. 
$C: That'd be hard for you to do, I'm pretty damn coolio. 
$C: I am republican and I am strongly agiasnt this shit
$C: Fear-mongering BS. 
$C: I think he forgot the /s
$C: Hopefully, the rules change can be hung up in the courts long enough to prevent actual enacting of the rule.  NY and a number of states are filing suit.

Mind you, since elections matter, some of this will involve dealing with the current ongoing court packing.  And, should it get that far, possibly seeing the FCC request fast tracking to the Supreme Court to beat the possible tide of the next election.  And we know how the election effected the Supreme Court. (Though no guarantee how that will go, the McConnell held up that appointment for many reasons.)

Still, we mustn’t lose hope.  Turn the tide on these politicians who enabled this and they will have to yield just to hold on to what little power they will have remaining.  

The biggest mistake, IMO, is letting Pai alone be the face of this while his enablers sit in the shadows, so to speak.
$C: > By 2018 it will likely be too late to implement change

It might be too late to simply change the agency's ruling, but it's never too late for Congress to overrule by passing a law. It's doable, just much harder.
$C: Damn, so much for listening to the American people...
$C: True. He was a compromise pick with McConnell to be a republican on the FCC.  And Trump appointed Pai chairman in 2017 to swing the axe.

Edit:
I’ll just add the detail that Pai’s 5 year term ended in 2017 and the last FCC commissioner was Wheeler, a Democrat (the deciding vote was always a D under Obama) who was under attack by opponents of net neutrality.

Republicans tried to abolish Net Neutrality under Obama and tried to create a controversy out of Wheeler’s refusal to vote against Net Neutrality.  At the time, Pai was vocal about eliminating what Pai labeled as government meddling.

So the 2016 election changed the deciding vote on the issue by allowing Trump to appoint Pai and replace Pai as a commissioner with a reliable GOP vote.

That is a lot of detail, but it still comes down to voting in elections.
$C: The President is required to add party members that don’t belong to his party to the FCC. Trump made him chairman in 2016 and with Trump’s election the FCC came under Republican control allowing for the repeal of net neutrality. 
$C: Republican nominee, recommended by Minority leader Mitch McConnell as replacement for Republican commissioner Meredith Baker.
$C: In January 2017, President Donald Trump designated Pai as FCC Chairman...
$C: He was the republican choice to balance the commission.  The FCC has 2 Democrats and 2 Republicans with a chairman as the 5th and deciding vote.

Trump made him the chairman and replaced him with another republican on the commission, this giving the republicans the tie break.

Obama’s last chairman was Wheeler. And Wheeler was the tie breaking vote to keep net neutrality.  Pai was the republican Obama appointed to keep the balance in the commission.
$C: Disturbingly true.  How am I to fight for my rights without foregoing my life or my family?  They need me and I want to be here for them, but our society is growing more and more oppressive.  I fear for future generations - they will not know the freedom that their elders once had.
$C: As a closeted american, care to give some examples? 
$C: Bingo. Money talks. Nothing else matters.

$C: ...temporarily.
$C: Dead on. If anyone thinks for one second this would be happening with someone else at the helm you are delusional.
$C: There should be room for people to be critical of the democratic party without being demonized for not walking in lockstep against the Republicans. I voted for Hillary, using the "lesser of two evils" argument. But the truth is she didn't campaign on anything a decent progressive or environmentalist could get behind. She didn't campaign on ending the wars in the middle east or a single-payer healthcare system or addressing corruption in our political system. She didn't support labor unions or the fight for 15 or anything important to a good portion of her party. And then come to find out, all the while, she had been running the DNC's finances during the entire election. It's funny that we were all just expected to give her our votes. She, as a politician, should have earned them or stepped out of the way for someone who could. Like, you know, Bernie Sanders. You can only use the "lesser of two evils" argument for so many elections in a row before you have to look past just one election cycle. Again, I voted for Hillary. Now I WISH I gave my vote to Jill Stein. I agree that we'd probably have net neutrality right now if she were elected. But that's speculation. So please don't demonize everyone who didn't vote against Trump "the right way."

Edit: for clarity
$C: Yes demonizing the people who didn't vote for *your* candidate will surely make them more likely to vote *your* way next time.

She supported the FCC's ruling to reclassify broadband as a utility, but she also supported SOPA/PIPA, so her reputation regarding tech is muddy at best. And if she did win, she would still have to deal with a Republican House and Senate, who will beat presidential vetoes in the end.
$C: Oh yes.  If only we had Hillary.  That would end the corruption in government.  Even Hillary fans know she is one of the dirtiest rats in the sewer.  Give me a break.
$C: I doubt it. Money talks.

$C: Won't really happen unless people start starving/huge lack of jobs. As long as most people have their Netflix and their lights and heat working we can bitch all we want online or gather up for the occasional Saturday protest but it won't change anything. 
$C: Corporate interests influencing politics more than civil interests.
$C: Okay. Thank you! 
$C: That's not true at all, Western Europeans with the exception of some British are all socialists. And no one thinks Democrat congressman/senators are commies, but we do think they are almost all socialists, many of whom admit to. Ask a Democrat the difference between a Democrat and a Socialist and they can't tell you, they're not conservative in any sense. They want bigger government in every single issue except for the military. Not getting what you're saying at all.
$C: Wow, 22 million?  That's almost ALL the people!!!
$C: You had to make irrational doomsday predictions to scare the masses into supporting it.  If you can't use the truth to get people on your side, then you have problems.

I can't explain it, because you would never listen.  You are probably the same dumbfuck in 2002 who was saying, "Care to explain what is good about stopping the Patriot Act?  Do you just want terrorists to destroy the United States."

The Patriot Act wasn't about protecting Americans from terrorists.  And NN is not about protecting Americans from ISPs.  If you can even entertain that thought, then maybe you can understand.  If you can understand then when you do your research on the subject you will find your answer.

But, until you understand the government does not give a shit about you or I, you will be in the darkness.  They are never making moves to help you.
$C: Sure whatever way you want to cut it to pretend the pro nn messages isn't a bunch of astroturfed hodgepodge.

Yes the totally real comments from totally real Americans from American cities like Vladivostok, Beijing  and hamburg.


$C: No they wont because people wont voluntarily pay for it. Are you so fucking stupid that even now you havent realised reddit has forced this activism for their own benefit.

Just watch and in 12 months time when nothing has changed in any meaningful way slap yourself for me.
$C: They OWN you. You pay them tributes, not taxes.
$C: You assume they actually "work".
$C: Well, if it were an 8th grade film project it would have gotten a nice fat flying F but since it's the federal government, they probably found some convenient way to make it cost over 500k. 
$C: [removed]
$C: Let's dispel once and for all with the fiction that Ajit Pai doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing. 
$C: Stripping civil liberties... Isn’t this how fascism starts?
$C: This is a great example of why liberals need to let go of the idea that all you need to do is be calm and rational and you'll magically convince the opposition of the superiority of your position. Horse shit.  Not everybody who disagrees with you is either innocent or ignorant.  There are sell-outs, political hit men, and straight-up enemies of freedom and democracy that don't give two shits about logic and reason.

We need resistance, we need targeted and effective protest, and most importantly we need *leverage* on key players and decision-makers to enact the regulations we need to reinstate net neutrality.  The reason Ajit Pai can give no fucks about what we think is that his position is unelected and thus we have absolutely zero leverage.  So he just does his master's bidding.  Time to take the fight to Congress.
$C: Is he Hindu? Or a "Christian?" His god must be money.
$C: He was hired by Obama. So Obama hired him to undo Obama Era regulations? Read his wikipedia.

$C: Haha no, reddit and social media platforms heavily censor and reduce visibility of the voices that don't fit the narrative. Keep whining though, this meltdown is better than any hollywood bullshit
$C: What social platforms allow freedom of speech? There isn’t one that hasn’t censored legal information for political reasons.. not even 4chan. All of them censor in some way. 

And the common defender to this is ‘they are private companies they don’t have to have freedom of speech’. 

So here we are. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Good luck with that, the US Military could use some target practice
$C: no one even mentioned anything related to this
$C: I can neither confirm nor deny that Ajit Pai didn't not rape and murder 4 or more or fewer teenage girls in or around 1998
$C: The kings New fool everybody ^
$C: No surprise this is the only comment on your account. Try harder, bot.
$C: Okay, let’s hear it. Let’s hear your cohesive argument on why NN is a good thing.

Bad bot. Bad. 
$C: I will turn off my adblocker for sites that use ethical ads and not virus infested pisshole services.

$C: Pai made a condescending video of "7 things you'll still be able to do" on the internet and basically acted like all people against the loss of net neutrality are idiotic children
$C: https://youtu.be/LFhT6H6pRWg
$C: Pompous assclown made a video where he is holding a fidget spinner and nerf gun, talking about how ending  net neutrality eliminates harmful regula...you know, I'm not even gonna finish that. I couldn't make it far into the video but it's a condescending attempt to show how stupid we are for supporting net neutrality. I truly hate that man, and what he represents. 

Ajit Pai is a traitor. 
$C: [Prepare to die inside](https://www.reddit.com/r/FellowKids/comments/7jo7o1/psa_from_chairman_of_the_fcc_ajit_pai_7_things/)
$C: No. Boycotting would be everyone switching to google fibers. Because google supports NN. And they would never implement it. But google fibers isnt everywhere yet, but everyone that is able to buy it definitely should. Fuck these companies, like verizon, comcast, etc. They deserve to go bankrupt. 
$C: What if we just had a National day to cancel your internet? Everyone at once so we can be heard.
$C: Or for content providers to shut down for days/weeks out of protest. Netflix, Google, pornhub, etc could straight up shut down access to anyone coming from IP addresses in districts where the representatives voted to repeal net neutrality, just show a screen saying "We know there is an issue. If you want your content back, contact your local representative." 


Could also hope that maybe states can change things independently? So that Mississippi doesnt have the same equal say on the future of internet as California. Aren't Republicans the party that is pro-states rights?
$C: Oligopoly.
$C: Comcast is the only internet option where I live. I wish I could...
$C: I can’t believe people would say things like that. Ajit Pai never raped and murdered four girls in 1998. It’s not like he’s a bad guy or anything. 
$C: What an insufferable fucking twat-copter
$C: "After these Obama era regulations are repealled." So he starts off the video basically saying "hey we are taking away your internet freedom to spite Obama! And it's already been decided and no amount of uproar from the American people will stop us! *shit eating grin" 


Man really.. I try to practice being a compassionate good human being.. but I would have no problem inciting violence against this piece of shit.
$C: This is a skit right? ...right??
$C: If it was about "restoring freedom", why would the arguments for it be based on "you can still.." rather than "now you can.."
$C: 1.) You have to be kidding me. This guy is shameless. He doesn’t give a shit as he takes his Verizon check all the way to the bank. 

2.) Dude’s lightsaber should, at the very least, be red for authenticity’s sake. 

3.) Screw ppl who’s entire political view revolves around how much of a tax break they can get and this idea of unregulated markets = fair markets. 

Smfh 
$C: It was nice that he said, "These Obama-era regulations..." Anything tied to Obama will get people agreeing with them...smh.
$C: Well that was painful.

$C: Fucking tool. 
$C: Ajit's happy face makes me want to blind myself with a soldering iron.
$C: Don’t fucking watch this shit.  Don’t give this smug piece of shit the benefit of knowing that people gave him attention.  Fuck this piece of shit right in his brown little bitch ass.

To thise that say its impossible, browse your own reddit history from years ago...following links to news articles, videos, blogs, etc and see how much of it exists today. I would bet you lose 10 percent of the content each year you go back, so if your a 10 year redditor, your first year on here is choch full.of dead links of content that is pretty much gone forever.

$C: I mean ‘should’ as in that’s what the majority wants, repealing is a terrible idea (for many reasons), and there will likely be mounting pressure to address this outrage.

As in ‘They *should* do what’s right and just, they *should* represent the voters and not the corporations and mega-donors’...

There’s already talk of cities and states writing their own NN laws, just like what happened when The Orange Idiot pulled us out of the Paris Climate Agreement.
$C: [I thought it's common knowledge at this point](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/06/06/new-mozilla-poll-americans-political-parties-overwhelmingly-support-net-neutrality/)
$C: Because majority of Americans use internet and are not shareholders of big ISPs. It's kind of like common sense you know. 
$C: Well we've taken multiple polls. Support is about 80%. So I would actually call that the vast majority, but hey. 
$C: [Poll: 83 percent of voters support keeping FCC's net neutrality rules](http://thehill.com/policy/technology/364528-poll-83-percent-of-voters-support-keeping-fccs-net-neutrality-rules)

[Three-fourths of Republican voters say they support net neutrality](http://www.businessinsider.com/republican-congressmen-ask-fcc-not-to-repeal-net-neutrality-2017-12)
$C: Well inept internet users will learn in the coming days of massive lawsuits. 

For example, New York’s attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, reports today that his six-month investigation has found up to 2 million fake comments submitted on behalf of citizens around the country. (Another 8 million were submitted under made-up names.) 

So the only people that really didn't support it weren't aware that their names were being used, were children, or already dead.  So hope that answered your question.  Have a great day.

$C: This is what happens when politicians rely on executive fiat to accomplish policy goals instead of getting laws passed through Congress. The only way we get Net Neutrality protected permanently is a Law from Congress. 
$C: God these analogies are on point.
$C: You might even say he’s a shit pie
$C: I don’t. I watched it live. But basically after her heartfelt speech against repealing NN he goes “I guess that’s a no” and the he and others burst into laughter. It’s disrespectful 
$C: Maybe not his family, but yeah.
$C: Noooo. Not his family. Just him. 
$C: People should not be harassed for any reason, and just because it's inevitable doesn't mean it's right.
$C: I hope the laughs in the background are in response to such a boneheaded response to Clyburn's statement. 


The fact that he took that so lightly goes to show further how he just doesn't give a rat's about what anyone else thinks. 
$C: He is one of the most smarmy disgusting assholes in DC. Every time I see his stupid smiling face I am reminded of why it's so important to fight corruption constantly, because of ass holes like him. 
What a cunt.  
$C: Worthless? I bet Verizon et al. think he's worth every penny. 
$C: God dammit I thought I could not get any more pissed off 
$C: I felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest after how he responded. I am an European citizen and I am deeply concerned about the state of NN in the US and learning that Ajit misrepresents that country this badly is leaving me extremely enraged and preoccupied, having adverse effects that manifest physically. How can scum like Ajit be allowed in that position? The US is under control of an organization of leeches and criminals. It's pissing me off man. 
$C: I'm literally shaking in anger at the disrespect he showed her. This is DISGUSTING. These people don't represent *anyone*, Republicans or Democrats, and it's gonna be a fuck of a day for them when they realize they can't eat money and they've sold our country upstream to people who could give a fuck about them. 
$C: To his credit, that was well timed. Asshole and disrespectful but well timed.

Mignon Clyburn. She’s the daughter of James Clyburn of the Congressional Black Caucasians. She is a Democrat member of the Federal Communications Commission, and this morning outside the FCC during a protest over the ending of net neutrality Mignon Clyburn (her nickname here is “Steak,” Steak Clyburn) had this to say…



This is about internet equality! And you’ve got two people that will sit in those chairs today, and they will be your voices for internet equality! But you’ve got a court system, you’ve got congresspeople, you’ve got millions of people who are in your corner and we will achieve internet newquality!
$C: Funny how anyone I’ve seen against net neutrality is also a trump supporter, they’re greatest weapon is spreading idiotically false news. 
$C: I know exactly what i'm talking about. My entire career revolved around network engineering and Internet. I've worked for some of the largest ISP's in the nation. You are the one who knows nothing about this and believes the propaganda. Please tell me how your Internet service was ever affected negatively prior to Net Neutrality. 
$C: Thats right, everyone you don't agree with must be opposition.... I'm actually a hardcore Ron Paul fan and libertarian. But Trump does have some great ideas. Hell, getting more accomplished than just about any other President in the past 40 years.

We (Merica) are not a democracy, we are a constitutional republic. We "elect" people to "represent" us. 

Our system has failed due to the corrupt asshats that "represent" us, and the sheep that keep electing these people into their cushy jobs...They no longer represent us, but instead represent anyone or anything that can put more money into their pockets. 

More government isnt the answer to anything. Im ashamed to say this, but the only way, that i see, to fix this problem is wipe the whole slate clean and start over. Keep the constitution in place, but totally wipe out the corrupt, fetid swamp and try again.

$C: Turns out the cure for shame is money.
$C: Username checks out.
$C: Implying the other candidate is perfect on every issue. Again, that's not how this works. They will have an issue you disagree with as well.
$C: Exactly this... there are representatives in Minnesota here who refuse to answer constituents and won’t even hold town halls... it’s horse shit 
$C: To reuse my example: consider a politician who supports the FCC but also supports increased funding for drug rehabilitation or state tuition assistance. It's certainly not impossible considering none of this is mutually exclusive.

Just because only one of these issues affects me (FCC) doesn't mean that's the only important one. And to generalize all of a politician's positions without actually looking into them is doing yourself and your community a disservice. It's selfish and a bit immature quite honestly.
$C: That's a great statistic to hear. It's a shame more of them didn't speak up, which is what really matters.

So your point could as easily be used against those who stayed silent, decreasing the majority of those numbers.
$C: You're making a lot of assumptions here. Not to mention the whole "what's to stop them..." argument that isn't really supporting the position. 

I understand what you're saying, but it's ridiculous to encourage people to use this as the sole issue people should look at. There are politicians in my area who I agree with on some things and disagree on others. To pick one issue would be a disservice to my community. 

These guys may agree with the FCC here but also support a local measure to increase funding for drug rehabilitation. It's not so black and white. Just because drug rehab doesn't affect me directly but this does, doesn't mean only one of the issues is important.
$C: let's be honest, even if it does happen, no one around here is going to give any mea culpas.
$C: So with a population of 320 million people, about 10% of the US comprises the will of the people
$C: I was continuing to think through this and using the CRA to undo this would lead to some interesting results... and an even more interesting dilemma down the line.

One of the things people miss about the use of the CRA is not only do its undo that reg, but it also prohibits a rule like that from being made again.  (Big caveat that we haven't seen the CRA be used a whole lot before so we don't know how that might fare in court...)

So say in 2018 the Democrats regain control of Congress but not a filibuster proof majority so they use the CRA to remove this rule.  Then later Republicans (or whatever follows them), unable to use the FCC to remove the NN rules, uses the CRA to remove the original rule as well... how do those two uses get resolved?  Under the CRA neither can hold force - NN was removed and cannot be added again, but NN was also affirmed and cannot be removed again...

The real solution is to pass this via legislation so its harder to undo.  But good luck with the idiots in control of Congress and the idiots playing #Resistance too.
$C: Most of the "rule" is actually their justification and appendix.  Here are the actual orders (page 39):

>VI. ORDERING CLAUSES
>123. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that, pursuant to sections 3, 10, 201(b), 230, 254(e),
303(r), and 332 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and section 706 of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, as amended, 47 U.S.C. §§ 153, 160, 201(b), 254(e), 303(r), 332, 1302,
this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking IS ADOPTED.

>124. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that pursuant to applicable procedures set forth in Sections
1.415 and 1.419 of the Commission’s Rules, 47 CFR §§ 1.415, 1.419, interested parties may file
comments on this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on or before July 17, 2017 and reply comments on or
before August 16, 2017.

>125. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Commission’s Consumer & Governmental Affairs
Bureau, Reference Information Center, SHALL SEND a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,
including the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small
Business Administration.

>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION

And the actual rules in Appendix A:

>PART 8: PROTECTING AND PROMOTING THE OPEN INTERNET

>1. Repeal and reserve Section 8.11

And then another part to change definitions that were adopted when they changed 8.11.

That's it.  I guess you could argue that this is a "rule" given the repeal of a previous amendment required a new amendment.  So I guess you might be able to use the CRA but I doubt it'd work... (nor would the Democrats have a chance to get enough votes within the 60 day window unless they just dilly-dally...)
$C: >Special infrastructure could be built to improve data releases like that, where 10s of millions of people are wanting exactly the same thing at exactly the same time. But that new infrastructure takes funding, and it is for a rather rare occurrence, so they would charge HBO a bit to use the new system for each of their releases.

That makes literally no sense though, since if you have more demand the only infrastructure that you can add is a higher bandwidth connection paired with more servers, and this isnt specialized infrastructure, either they (HBO) buys additional infrastructure or rents it and there will ***never*** be any reason that said infrastructure cant be used for *literally anything else*



$C: Take to the streets.
$C: Kill the 3 people who voted yes. Duh.
$C: Seriously. It's easy to find fault, but hard to offer a solution.
$C: I have no idea. I just know enough to see that previous one, the one that failed, hasn't worked and it would be incredibly unwise to use it again. 

It's not about going "uh yeah but what's your idea then huh?" It's about thinking of one rather than attacking people who are pointing out how useless the current tactic is. 

You think this current letters to santa is a good tactic? You think it's working? 
$C: See. This is actually useful. My ideas were kinda maybe not good. 

Surround their houses. Take up all the seats in their wife's favorite brunch spots. Get in our cars and just totally block up traffic in DC and around their houses. Suspend their kids from school for having shitty parents. Put billboards up with their cell phone numbers with the words "local sluts want your cock" because let's face it, they are fucking everyone. 

I think the run for office thing isn't great. If we all run for office the votes will be watered down. 
$C: That is just the saddest response. And I don't mean that in an insulting you way. Because yes doing something is better than doing nothing. But this doing we having been doing is doing nothing.

Doing. 
$C: muh states rights


No, I think congress has been infiltrated by red bastards who believe in god and party over country. I think we need a reinstatement of the HUAC and loyalty oaths and we need to summarily remove and blacklist all lawmakers who have allegiances to anything other than the American Republic. I think this is disproportionately the case in congress, which has went off the fucking deep end in absurd unconstitutional and generally destructive use of their lawmaking power, and I have no faith in any good that can be done with giving _more_ power to that branch in the hopes that it would fix net neutrality, while it would more likely be used to strip EPA regulations than reinstate a free and open internet. 
$C: Yes I think the legislative branch is bought and sold. 
$C: The post was made about 20min prior to the actual vote
$C: [Dewey Defeats Truman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Defeats_Truman)

It doesn't matter how predictable it seems, it's disingenuous to say what the vote *was* before it happens. It is fine, however, to say what you think the vote *will* be.

If it's so obvious, go ahead and write up your post with that assumption in mind, sure, but you don't actually hit "post" until your beliefs have been confirmed. Which is what the reddit admins should have done - yes, they ended up being right, but spez jumped the gun and should not have done that. Can't blame JPTIII (or anyone else) for taking the admin's post at face value.
$C: Got a source for that?

and if that's all there is we're gonna have a hard time making an argument. Anything else?
$C: To be fair, i don't know a single person who uses Torrents for anything other than piracy. I'm not saying there aren't other reasons for the clients, because I'm well aware that there are many... But i have never personally met a single person who uses them for those reasons. 
$C: Yep. The EFF will be one. I’m hoping there are half a dozen others. I don’t want to have to start downloading everything I can access now in a hurry. I’m not tech savvy enough. 
$C: Boycott. Bleed them of a few hundred million dollars and push for municipal broadband. If everybody would do this, we could short their stocks and buy the ISPs...
$C: Yep. Its pretty simple. Supply and demand. 

Stop paying the supplier and it will dissapear, driving demand up, therefore inspiring new businesses to move in to obtain the juicy profits.

But if people actually have standards and dont pay shitty companies BS prices then the only businesses that would survive are the ones that treat you like a valued customer.

If people quit paying businesses the moment that they quit actually being treated as a valued customer (not just being told you are) then most businesses would treat people how they should.

They dont treat people like they should because they know they dont have to. People wont do shit +85% of the time.
$C: Lol, kind of figured. I'm angry, too. 

The problem is that the Left has issues in it's agenda, which means they have stances or positions concerning the issues they care about, *but they have no direction as a mobilized social and political force*, and so, they let issues slide right by and off of their agenda. It begins to look like they don't care. 

Do you know what the Right fears? A *mobilized* Left. The Right fears a mobilized left because it is the most powerful force in the world. The Left cannot be mobilized, though, because the Left does not look to *one* voice to effect change. If the Left would give a little bit of money and 100% non-violent, purely economic cooperation to *one* voice, it would be so totally mobilized that it could achieve its agenda in one year, and leave a trail of economic destruction across the worst offenders on the stock market, *and* come out the other side wealthier and happier.

...

But people are stupid. Sure, I could fix this all, if they'd listen, but people think they are too damned smart to have to make the 'sacrifice' of cooperation.
$C: Plus, at least you will still have Reddit. I believe u/spez has commented on the subject saying he doesn’t negotiate with terrorists
$C: Also what did the women's march end up accomplishing?  Nothing.  They ignored us because we were peaceful.
$C: Yup, my libertarian friend is staunchly against NN yet admits he doesn't know what it means. Same argument, killing innovation.
$C: The fact that you think this is true shows how uninformed you are.
$C: They receive "donations" or "contributions" from companies, in this case it was primarily from ISPs. It's horrible. 
$C: Women fought for years for a right to vote. Black people fought for years (and are still fighting today) for civil rights. LGBTQ fought for years for the right to marriage. We can fight a little longer for everyone's right to have a covenant free internet. 
$C: That sounds like a joke
$C: Russians? I dont think Russians are influencing us psychologically via the internet...Russian citizens with too much free time, maybe, but not the entire Russian government.
$C: that was a while ago, let it go. The rest of us have moved on.

$C: Whats hilarous is the only reason ISP's were title 2 was because the Government essentially forced the FCC to do so during lawsuits against Comcast and Verizon being dickish to their consumers.

[Here's a picture/gif of a cat,](http://random.cat/i/972311_10151615676001211_1482506191_n.jpg) hopefully it'll cheer you up :).

 I am a bot. use !unsubscribetosadcat for me to ignore you.
$C: I'm not sure about the history, but well, the problem with having Congress write Net Neutrality law right now is that it's hard to get everyone to agree. Not all Republican representatives are on board with Net Neutrality, and many Democratic representatives do not want to compromise on the rules.
$C: >Pai’s ~~punchable~~ burnable face

FTFY
$C: That will never happen as the people that make the laws are the very same that this would harm
$C: Lol sorry. I am not as gooder with my English as I am with math
$C: Damn.  That's totally true.  
$C: Do you have *any* proof of this?
$C: Socially - most certainly not. Fiscally - we reached a conservative peak with Reagan and perhaps now with Trump, though that's arguable considering how strongly opposed he is.
$C: Nope.   Not even in Alabama.  
$C: If *any* president deserved to be impeached, it would probably be Andrew Jackson.

And maybe James Buchanan. Although Buchanan didn't really do anything to warrant impeachment—or, in fact, anything at all. Especially not anything to prevent the impending Civil War.
$C: Why?  In all seriousness?  The thing that most negatively impacted me personally as a younger sort of in pretty good health kind of guy is the forced insurance thing that I still don't understand and will probably end up getting fucked by.  
$C: We can fight it, be ignored and lose.

Or we can be silent, be ignored and lose.

Whats the difference.

"Getting attention" on reddit didn't change the vote no matter how many times it got attention. We didn't change a thing. I contacted my represtenatives at least 20 times. Not a single thing changed. They didn't even read my messages, just gave me the same old automated message back.

There is no fighting this, We are just ignored.
$C: Good thinking
$C: In that case, Spez has to edit his comment with something like "Absolutely!" to bait them. 
$C: In that case, you can be assured that they'd have to sign something that bans them from the ability to post such information in the wild as it could be extremely damaging to their company.
$C: lol at you thinking conservatives look at any kind of 'proof' that goes contrary to their views. 
$C: I’m not disagreeing with you, but why didn’t cable companies implement packages like this before net neutrality? Net neutrality has only been a thing since 2015. 
$C: You think reddit wouldn't sell out? That's laughable.

$C: Why quote the thing we all just fucking read? 
$C: I think spez and other Admins just regift the gold. And also they have unlimited gold anyways. Just my guess though.
$C: It's not about the gold. It's the thought that counts.

Or at least that's what I keep telling myself.
$C: Hi, Tim Cook here. PM me and I’ll give you my address for the phone (8 please) and Ipad.
$C: 4 gold = end world hunger. ( for you, don't count me in this)
$C: Yup, now you gotta spring for an Apple TV.
$C: Well fucking played. 
$C: I wish I could afford to give you all gold. You guys are a big reason that I’m moving even further to spread the message to friends, family, and coworkers who are unaware of this change. 
$C: Just put down an apple near Steve's grave, that'd be enough.
$C: Giving gold is more about supporting reddit and making a statement that this kind of content is desired than giving a gift for one user.
$C: When I click on your profile there's a thing on the right that says, "Want to make posts on your own profile? Sign up to test the Reddit post to profile beta." - That this message exists tells me that the ugly obnoxious new profile mess isn't mandatory yet. However, today not long after this thread was made, my profile changed to the new one, and *without* me clicking anything about trying out the "beta test"! When it first came out, I'd heard one other user complain that when they tried it, they could not revert it, so I made doubly sure not to click on anything that might activate it!

So my question is, has this been foisted on everybody, or did my account glitch out? If the latter, considering I did not do anything to activate it and thus should not be punished with its god-awfulness, is there anything that can be done to undo this mess?
$C: Please buy my wonderful girlfriend an Apple TV. She doesn't understand the value of money, but she's amazing and thinks she needs one. :D happy holidays!
$C: How to get gold and karma 101 ⬆️
$C: /u/spez  can LITERALLY manifest gold out of the ether.  its funny how everyone is giving it to him.  
$C: Bypass all of that and just buy Tim Cook some Apple stock. Enough to cover the cost of those items so he has the freedom to pick which ones he wants. 
$C: “That iMac pro really is bad ass” 

- Tim Cook
$C: Send him one of [these](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1c/f3/95/1cf395d90bb2852b5574ea3e8c101c5a.jpg).
$C: Just 1 apple with a bite taken out of it.  See how he likes it.
$C: I hated those edits
$C: SHUT THE FUCK UP WITH THE EDITS
$C: We don't give gold to terrorists
$C: Watch how quickly regular usage of proxies expands across the general population of Reddit users.  

This fight ain't over by a long shot.  There are a lot more smart guys fighting against this than are fighting for it.   
$C: It seems a lot more likely that streaming video will get victimized (both provider and consumer). Reddit bandwidth is a drop in the bucket compared to netflix, hulu, amazon, youtube, porn, etc.
$C: You're concerned about a few kilobytes of text on Reddit?
$C: How about moving Reddit hosting to Europe?
$C: Good old pay to play rules... Wait, which rules were that? Oh yes, the ones created by the fear mongering. 
$C: That isn't in the best interest of the internet providers to do this though. Internet providers understand why their customers use the internet they won't be making any decisions that will cause the loss of customers and not providing all of the internet would greatly harm their sales. Secondly no internet company did this before 2015 when the law repealed today didn't exist. 3rd this was already legal under net neutrality as long as you fully explained as an internet provider what it is you were blocking when you provided the service. Everyone is freaking out over nothing.
$C: Reddit has been broken.  They are only for NN because they want to control what is seen, not ISPs.  That's why all edge providers are trying to get people to support NN, it's a fight for control, not neutrality.
$C: Dude we had non net neutrality from 1996-2015....reddit need to fucking chill
$C: You pay only $99/mo for the freedom of speech package
$C: If they block one of the largest forums on the internet, especially with the thousands of voices on here every day... America has really lost its value of free speech that generations past have struggled to fight for, and maintain. 
$C: Then remember what party decided to axe online free speech the next time you’re in a voting booth. 
$C: We Europeans will take care of Reddit for you
$C: The ISPs will just secretly edit comments they disagree with. Oh wait...
$C: Id say DDos him.
Civil war?


People can only take so much before they snap. U get millions of people snapping, nothing can stop them.

Trump is enough, but with this asshole too?

This is a volcano just waiting to erupt.
$C: Then we start the motherfuckin revolution.
$C: Reddit is one of the largest sites on the internet. We aren’t the special elite secret club that some people seem to think this site is. We have bargaining power. 
$C: Then I will finally breathe the free air again, Theoden-King.

My guess is that won't happen, though. That would be a whole bunch of definitions of political suicide.
$C: Why would they? Also, if your entire life is devoted to this shitty app to the point where you couldn’t stand to live without it - it might be time to reconsider your beliefs.
$C: We all have time to go out and protest.
$C: Then the world will be a better place. 
$C: The world will be a better place.
$C: Use a different supplier.
$C: Why on earth would they do that? They didn't do it before 2015. Buncha chicken littles if you ask me.
$C: That really cool thing is that now you are asking that question about the potential actions of a private business, which is purely motivated by profit, and not political ideology or protecting a regime.

Whereas under NN (i.e. government regulation and oversight of the internet traffic and content) we would be having to ask this question about the government itself.

It is relatively easy to topple a private business. A government that controls the flow of information? not so much.
$C: Well, i guess then loads of whiny, crybaby, 1st-world-problem comments would be lost in the darkness of oblivion forever.

$C: Reddit is a place for people to share ideas. Is they start censoring ideas that disagree with them, they are no better than the ISPs.
$C: >People have different opinions that I do, BAN THEM!
$C: > Yet, The_Donald still remains. 

They're not terrorists, just basement dwellers that are very frustrated and angry for no apparent reason.
$C: TD is allowed to express their opinion. Whether or not you like them isn't relevant.
$C: Aw shut the fuck up for one second will you. As if T_D is even relevant anymore
$C: Reddit is upset that the FCC is doing to them what reddit did to subs like the_Donald. 

I support net neutrality, but damn it's funny seeing reddit act like freedom-fighters after wearing the crown of censorship. Shoe's on the other foot, lads. Maybe next time don't be evil.
$C: >the government should control the internet, because they would never block internet traffic to content they do not approve of. 

>ISPs might make up pay a few bucks to access sites that suck huge amounts of data transfer. This is a threat on free speech! (????)

>Reddit admin, why haven't you unilaterally banned this group I don't like yet?!

Can you not sense your own incongruousness?

$C: Yep. Good job alienating possible future business partners spez. 
$C: Lol. You are a deranged lunatic. 
$C: TIL t_d appointed the FCC commissioners

TIL t_d singlehandedly founded America on the basis of capitalism and individual rights (and not federal control of industry)

TIL t_d altered space-time and made everyone forget how terrible the internet was from 1996 to 2015.

shit, how'd I miss all of that?!
$C: Not a terrorist organization?
$C: Living in your head rent free
$C: Yeah, and r/latestagecapitalism

See? I can whine too.
$C: Sadly, this is the case. Just yesterday I had to respond to a Twitter comment made by someone I share mutual friends with who said that the repeal of net neutrality would result in faster download speeds. A vast majority of people don't have the slightest clue what this vote means or how it will impact them. 

For context I'm a college student and see daily comments from friends lately about how annoying it is to see net neutrality discussed on Twitter and other social media platforms. 

$C: browsed /r/all/new and saw a T_D post praising Pai...Not surprised!
$C: Yeah, no joke. I've brought up the fact that NN was the norm before Verizon v. FCC in 2014 a few times now, and *every* time the response was absolutely nothing. Not that it stopped the accounts from spewing nonsense elsewhere; they just moved on. At most, they just changed their talking points, as though they weren't clearly ignorant about the issue literally two hours earlier.
$C: Well it's a good thing in that it's getting people politically involved. It's going to be a long fight to get NN back, but, a win will further motivate people. 
 
"I'm just one person, what can I do?" "The rich control everything and there's nothing we can do about it!" "Why bother? We're just the little guy and we have no power" ... 
 
Never forget; One person, One vote. You have far more power than you realize.
$C: I go to a GA high school and many conservatives here celebrated the repeal. I don't understand the stupidity of some people.
$C: That is itself an ignorant position to take. I'm for net neutrality, but I'm against the FCC having the power to have any say at all. If this issue is important to Americans then it should go through Congress, and be voted on properly. There shouldn't be small government agencies that can drastically change policy one way or the other without extreme oversight. 
$C: I am a democrat and I support the repeal. This will mean a more open net and no censorship of animal porn. 
$C: No one actually distrusts the government? You don't think the companies that support this have the lobbying influence to get the rules written to favor themselves over their competition? I can't believe this. 
$C: Just because they disagree with you doesn't mean they're automatically a paid shill. It's a stupid position to take, but writing off all opposing views as being paid shills accomplishes nothing besides adding fire to the circle jerk.
$C: No letters. Actual people. On the steps of Congress and at the White House fence.
$C: And what did you do, Rambo? 

e:  Holy shit you've spammed this comment 37 times in this thread.  You are an interesting dude
$C: > all other avenues have been exhausted

No, the courts and congress remain. I'm not going to apologize for holding off on the violent option while plausible alternatives are still available.
$C: Watch over the course of years, not months. It's like how the repeal of the fairness doctrine led to the bullshit we have today.
$C: Sorry, I thought psychos was a nicer term than literal retards but if you'd prefer I'll use that word
$C: "It's only oppression if the government puts a collar around my neck! But Mickey  can tug my leash til his heart's content"
$C: I want to upvote you to let you know you’re not alone.  But the karma is presently at negative 69, which I found amusing for some juvenile reason.
$C: This is actually a choice by the FCC to not exercise control they had been exercising ...
$C: The FCC is a regulatory agency. We can either write a law protecting Net Neutrality, or we can have regulations that protect it. The FCC needs ISPs to be governed as common carriers under Title II to be able to enforce anything. Title II basically says "you're allowed to continue operating like a monopoly if you're subjected to stricter regulations so we can still protect consumers" (because monopolies are inherently anti-consumer, but sometimes get the job done more efficiently than normal free-market competition might do). So without a law being written we currently have the worst of both worlds. We have effective monopolies or duopolies AND they can do whatever they want as though they aren't actual monopolies.

We already know what ISPs will do with this freedom because [they've had that freedom before](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171122/09473038669/fcc-releases-net-neutrality-killing-order-hopes-youre-too-busy-cooking-turkey-to-read-it.shtml) (hint: it involves prioritizing content they own over competitors' content), which is why the reclassification happened in 2015 in the first place.
$C: wew lad
$C: Well hierarchical centralized organisations do exhibit this tendency of attracting people hungry for power at the top, so that's not wrong... There shouldn't be a centralized entity that has any kind of control over our lives, we need to get rid of that. It can't go well on the long run. 
$C: Republicans think their representatives stand for the private sector and small business? TF??????!!
$C: Obama appointed this guy at the advice of Mitch McConnell. It's all public. 
$C: Regulations put in place under anyone are ______ Era regulations.
$C: How can you be so sure of that when exactly that has been tried in the past already and ended up servicing greed of ISPs share holder and didn't benefit customers in any way?

You're basically hoping that a good company that is not too much baled by greed will come and compete and bring the prices down
That happened in France, and that can happen in a neutral internet. Ans it remains hopeful, i wouldn't repeal a consumer protection law just based on hope, that's plain stupid.
$C: Mess with society as a whole? He deserves social justice. He'll regret soon. The voice to the people!

"We blocked Google Wallet access because in Verizon, AT&T and Comcast we want to push ISIS, the new mobile way to pay, also, if you have funds in GW? Fuck you, you can't get your money back."

Good times.
$C: The price of freedom is that we are all doomed to fight for it forever. So yeah, we will rebuild again. We will come back. Change is good. Beating around the bush and trying the same failing idea over and over again is not right. What the FCC did today is a sign of one elite class overruling the lower classes. The last time this happened the worst financial crash in history happened. That evened the bar for many years and it will do it again soon. 
$C: "Again...." (in that tired-ass, I can't believe you made this mess again voice)

  OTOH, think of the cool shit we could build with the WPA this time around. I still see stuff in my state that was built by the WPA in the 1930's.

$C: **This**!
 
Today, people whine about getting "copyright strikes".

I once had to argue with a (competent but brainwashed) ISP drone about committing the sin of using \*gasp!\* *Linux*, which wouldn't run their required (Windows-only) spyware.

Yes folks, **that's** what we're going back to today.  Never mind Reddit vs "Comcastit", you'll just be completely taken out of the picture unless you're willing to let them have hardware-level access to your computer 24/7 (say, do you have a webcam?  You, uh, know we require that as a condition of access, right?  BTW, you sound cute!)
$C: That's because most of them came of age and voted for "not a crook" Nixon who turned out to be, who would have guessed it, a crook.
$C: dox pai. 2nd amendment will take care of the rest.
$C: It's the cycle. Republicans fuck everything up, Democrats do their best to try and fix it, people get pissed off that Democrats haven't fixed enough, vote Republican.
$C: People always forget. My dad told me this in the nineties. That people vote the republicans in and they do a bunch of crazy shit. They get voted out and then things are calm for a while and people forget. Republicans get voted in and then the crazy shit. It’s a cycle. One that’s been happening for some time now. 
$C: And back then, it was that Southerners would not vote Republican.

The parties started to shift in the 30s but said shift didn't really gain speed until the 60s.
$C: Ahh yes unlike dems who so often vote republican right? 
$C: Prior to Obama's first time, the Republicans at least **tried** to look innocent. Not anymore.
$C: It was customary for a president to appoint the fcc chair to a member of the opposing party. Obama played by the rules at the time of the political switch to playing with some degree of honesty to being blatant oligarchs. 
$C: Is any of what they are saying true though? I need to research what topic 2 actually did, as I am evidently ignorant as to its implications. I haven't seen a noticeable change in my own internet experience between pre 2015 and post 2015, yet they talk like monumental change occurred.
$C: Same game, different field.  
Maybe different league.
$C: ISPs being nice because they're forced to.

NN was a reaction to figuring out that the internet was vulnerable to exploitations.
$C: Never said it was
$C: I will concede that the FCC has made it very hard to have competition in the market. That's why the repeal of Net Neutrality is legitimately scary even for people who are against legislating it.

The thing is, a socialized internet is a bad thing because it lets the government have control over the flow of information.There are definitely bad businesses that will try and do the same thing. Some of the biggest names. However, ISPs will not be allowed to abuse us. They have to answer to us. Communication lines can be rebuilt and everyone that the ISP tries to screw in your area is going to potentially be a part of the startup that puts that monopoly out of business.
$C: You are completely missing their point.

They are demonstrating an example of how a giant showing of corruption has already occurred recently and
a.) No one did a thing about it.
b.) If no one did enough about the recent reveal of corruption in the DNC, which is more significant that the FCC being corrupt, then 
c.) No one will do enough to fix the corruption in the FCC. 

Just because Hillary is being used as an example doesn't make it a distraction. It was an example.
$C: Tbh I still don't like those odds.
$C: > Who had lobbyists in this? Telecommunication or consumers?

Both? Both sides had lobbyists.

>Also, often times we have no competition to take our money to when this happens.

Except NN discourages competition..... Removing NN does the opposite. Removing regulations and giving power back to the companies who actually make and control said infrastructure encourages investment into bigger networks. 

Removing power from the companies who you want to expand discourages the exact thing you want them to do

How exactly does removing power from a company and adding regulations help to remedy this:

>Also, often times we have no competition to take our money to when this happens.

$C: Sure, totally, makes perfect sense.

Now, simple question:

If they had voted to keep NN, would they still be "obviously taking bribes"?

Or is that only when someone disagrees with you
$C: I didn’t think of it that way, holy hell. I’m not bullshitting when I say if/when that happens, I’m ditching internet completely until my votes get people elected who will bring back net neutrality. I can find a million ways to keep myself occupied without spending more money for access to this app or that website. Fuck ‘em. 

Edit: Thanks for the explanation and for taking the time, it’s much appreciated. 
$C: He's actually a mod at r/nonetneutrality.

He's spamming this thread as a troll.
$C: It's not your role to declare what "the point" is.

The animalistic rage hordes on reddit screamed over and over: "THEY ARE STEALING THE INTERNET"



You attempt to cover this up and mislead about it after the fact, by variously claiming or strongly implying that people didn't scream over and over "THEY ARE STEALING THE INTERNET", but rather simply declared that "We think it will get more expensive and partitioned and less open".

These are not the same. Writing "THEY ARE STEALING THE INTERNET", which was factually written or extremely heavily upvoted many times, is not the same as your retconned phrasing.

Your relationship with the truth is like the majority of Reddit's: completely morality-absent. You lie to edit the past as easily as you breathe, because you find it useful, and there is no humanity or morality in you to block you from that. 

Given this I literally struggle to see you as a human being, because I associate being a human being with having a conscience that should prevent you from doing this.


$C: Username checks out. 
$C: Exactly. There has never been a better time to brush up on your American Government Basics as a citizen. We all have to do this; the entire pro argument is that the Internet should be level for everyone, so everyone is gonna have to do their part to protect it.
$C: How do we get people to participate? Alabama had the opportunity to show the world that they weren't going to let a racist pedophile into the senate and they barely managed that with 20% turnout. 
$C: Now is not the time to give up. What the fuck did all those idiots in New England survive a cross-ocean trek and a full on mutiny from the Crown for, if we're just gonna roll over and let a new kind of tyrant control our lives? Fuck that. I'm not giving up. I'm gonna keep calling, and emailing, and protesting, and when election season comes my reps are gonna know exactly how I'm voting and why. This will not be forgotten.

(The Switch IS a nice distraction, as a side note. Mine never leaves my side. :D)
$C: This has seriously been making me consider a career in politics just so I can take a spot away from a corrupt motherfucker. 
$C: Dramatic much? The world isn't ending. Nothing significant will change just like thing were fine before NN was illegally instituted by Obama.
$C: Notice the vote was along party lines.

Notice that when Obama was in the oval we had Tom Wheeler at the FCC who was a strong advocate in favor of maintaining net neutrality and who had codified a lot of previously unwritten net neutrality rules.  

This is a partisan issue that shouldn't be because Republicans are able to be bought and paid for on every issue from climate to net neutrality to tax reform to healthcare.  

Democrats may not be perfect, but incredible amounts of progress in the right direction happens just from people showing up at the polls every single election and voting D down the line.  

The Republican Party is morally and intellectually bankrupt.  
$C: Not if we reclaim control with votes. We have to ensure our own future at this point, and step one is sinking our claws into those seats and making sure the next ass that touches it is one we approve of, not a corporate mouthpiece.
$C: Jesus Christ the FCC vote was literally divided down party lines, and only initiated because of the appointment of Ajit by the Trump administration.

Pull your head out of your ass, the Democrats aren't perfect but the things they can be bought out on are a whole lot more subtle than this.
$C: Well the GOP is the anti net neutrality party in Congress, whether that be from lobbying or general malintent, so maybe let's not vote as many of them in during the next election? 

If it was just a matter of being bought out, then why aren't there more Democratic politicians that have been paid to be against net neutrality?
$C: One way to find out.
$C: This is why we also vote for those who talk about reforming campaign contributions specifically. Lobbying can be made less effective, but we need to change the way we handle campaign contributions.

As said by someone else, we vote out those that don't agree or make good on their promises. It means we have to be alert and pay attention, and use our most sacred of civil rights to voice pur disapproval. It's what these scumbags in office fear more than anything, and they spend a lot of time and effort to spin things so that you don't act and remain complacent.

$C: There are [plenty of examples](https://www.freepress.net/blog/2017/04/25/net-neutrality-violations-brief-history) where ISPs violated the principles of net neutrality prior to 2015, and ISPs are going to be even more brazen now that they know they'll be free of any repercussions for at least the next 3 years. 
$C: Simple, Companies had complete power to throttle internet services at their leisure and censor content.

This one's canadian, but still applies. Telus a telecom company in Canada block access of their users to a pro-union website: http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/telus-cuts-subscriber-access-to-pro-union-website-1.531166

and these are just the few examples the ACLU has given so yeah there was a lot wrong and there can be more wrong done soon enough. The internet has changed drastically since its inception and is used by pretty much everyone for vital parts of their lives such as their work or schooling. Allowing companies to have full control over that with no regulation asks for trouble as these examples have shown.
$C: [Sad but true... he was openly gloating.](http://www.newsweek.com/net-neutrality-vote-fcc-chairman-ajit-pai-jokes-about-internet-freedom-747891)

That's Martin Shkreli levels of douchebaggery. I hope they wind up in the same cell together someday.
$C: Spoiler: they don't
$C: That's not really worth the slowdown of not having agencies regulate things. Not to mention congresspeople would have to be well-versed on those topics to make any decisions that the public wouldn't think are grossly uneducated. This is why scientists and engineers need to head those agencies, not bought-out idiots.
$C: [deleted]
$C: That's the part I have the most trouble understanding. They voted to overturn rules that were placed on them? Why are they allowed to?
$C: I'm not American and not a fan of Trump but are you honestly implying Hilary fucking Clinton would want to preserve Net Neutrality
$C: Could have. Probably wouldnt tho. 
$C: He was appointed by Obama in 2012....

$C: I love my AG. He's the one working with Mueller on concurrent state indictments that can't be pardoned.
$C: Thank you. That was a super quick response. 
$C: The comment you are replying too is a big reason why this vote went the way it went.

Laziness, refusing to vote or throwing away your vote, refusing to educate ourselves on the issue, insisting both parties are the same.  This is the hallmark of every political battle in this country.  

The fight for net neutrality started last year when a pro net neutrality candidate ran against an anti-net neutrality candidate.  Everyone saw what happened in between there and here.....and still.....people too lazy to even look up their representative's email address.  They probably don't even know who their representative is.  And they are emailing that rep *AFTER* THE VOTE HAS ALREADY HAPPENED.


$C: Honestly, I thought yall could fabricate something a little more creative and insightful than what I could conjure in an email.
$C: typical Sanderista
$C: Yeah, they would have to win all 11 tossups, but I think it's possible, especially with the current political climate.
$C: Good point
$C: You mean the guy who [refuses to concede](http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/14/politics/roy-moore-video-ballots/index.html), and with the backing of the Koch Brothers will most certainly sue the state for a recount or runoff election?
$C: I'm not giving up, I'm just saying a democratic resolution to all of this corruption is unlikely.
$C: *democratic
$C: [deleted]
$C: Ugh, polls. As a former apqc employee I learned how easy they are to manipulate, usually though wording of questions. 
$C: Hmmm. Canceling our home internet and using a library. Not sure what you think I'm not grasping. Yes, I realize it could change and using wifi out in public may be very different. Yes, I know that libraries may be negatively affected. But we aren't going to give ISPs any more of our money if they're going to limit what we can do online. 
$C: How is canceling my home internet the same as using a public wifi? I'll say what I said to the other guys. Yes, I know it'll be different, and that library wifi may be negatively affected, but we refuse to give those ISPs any of our money if they want to control what we do online.

$C: Oh believe me, I'm supporting the candidate that supports NN. Unfortunately, the district I'm in went for Trump by over 33%. Bunch of old rich people in a huge retirement community live in this district.
$C: Please send help.
$C: Time to eat the FCC.
$C: My guess is France.
$C: lmao
$C: Yes, he could appoint a new FCC head that was in favor of NN or treating the internet as a utility and reverse the current ruling. This back and forth that is going on could all be brought to an end though if Congress passed laws preserving NN. However Congress is currently ruled by Republicans who have no interest in what is good for the American people, only what's good for their wallets.
$C: probably not because the House and Senate are currently very Republican.  But 2018 is when those majorities can potentially change.
$C: **[House Vote for Net Neutrality](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2011/h252)**

Just remember it was republican FCC members who voted against NN and it was Republicans who nominated Pai to head the FCC.

$C: Nor did you vote for the supreme court  justices or the head of the EPA. This is not a direct democracy.  And again,  thank goodness it's not.  
$C: Your understanding of net neutrality is limited if you believe that is the only outcome of this decision. 
$C: When representatives no longer listen to their constituents and do whatever they want, against the will of the populace, that is literally what the second amendment is for. Just because that makes you uncomfortable doesn’t make it any less true. Ajit Pai just pulled a tyrannical government move.

If you’re an able bodied male between the ages of 17 and 45, you’re part of the militia. I’m not inciting violence, I’m pointing out where we are headed. If the FCC won’t ever listen, and the Republican Congress does nothing to correct them in our favor, the second amendment is the populace’s last course of rightful action. 


$C: Yeah. But still. It doesn't matter what 83% of Americans think of a vote even with a representative democracy (If only it cared to all the members of congress) 


$C: You have a wirus on your PC. You need to open Intanet Explora and download MyRescue123. Then you should click Stat Menu and click Run. Yes that’s R as in Roger, U as in Urethra, and N as in fuck Net Neutrality.

Yes do you see the window? Please enter your credit card for the charge for the service to your PC, yes? Taank you.
$C: This user is trolling.

He's a mod at r/nonetneutrality.
$C: You know where he works.  Do something pussy.  Oh what’s that?  Excuses already?  Lol so easy to shout for someone to be violent but you don’t have the balls to do a thing yourself.  

How about this - go vote in the mid-terms something millions of Americans who are pro NN probably will be too lazy to do.  
$C: If violence wasn't your last resort, you didn't resort to enough of it.

Maxim #6 - The Seventy Maxims of Maximally Effective Mercenaries
$C: You sound insane. 
Violence when we don't get what we want, really? Are you stupid?
$C: Someone handed him a note which is when he told everyone they all had to evacuate or leave.
$C: But then all the ISPs won't allow south park to be streamed because it's making fun of their bitch!
$C: They have the money the ISPs would ask for. 
$C: They will make a lot more money than it will cost them
$C: *money*
$C: > affect them also

Meaning what?
$C: Lmao one of the ghosts would have been the AOL running man logo 
$C: I hope when he gets drunk one night someone tattoos Verizon  on his forehead 

$C: exactly
$C: I know he doesn't care about us, but I'm surprised having a bomb sniffing dog come in right before his vote didn't give him any pause.
$C: Thank you for this dose of reality
$C: Did anyone try giving him Reddit Gold though?


$C: >I never expected him to change his mind. Unfortunately money speaks louder then the American People.

FTFY
$C: Yeah but I wonder if bullets are louder than money, maybe Ajit Pai can hear bullets enter his skull
$C: No, it's too good.
$C: She also should have been a VP consideration for the Dems in 2016. Watch her. She's bright. 
$C: Her first name means "cute" in French.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Jessica Rosenworcel is the one I was talking about, actually.
$C: I'm on the Pai is evil bandwagon but this. Idk about this. Violence prabably isn't the answer.
$C: We may be hearing about this on the news VERY soon
$C: There are thousands of people who work at the FCC who have absolutely nothing to do with net neutrality or even the Internet. Why hurt thousands of innocent people whose job is to do things like make sure PBS is carried across America, or make sure AM and FM radio stations don't interfere with each other, or make sure emergency alerts can go out to people like those affected in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico this year? Don't be insane, Timothy, Jr. 
$C: Calling for terrorism wow dude 
$C: >bomb sniffing dog

I love Net Neutrality as much as the next guy but Jesus, you don't have to pull a Lex Luthor on them

EDIT: TIL there is a portion of Reddit that is okay with bombing the FCC
$C: [deleted]
$C: Yep, they both got in trouble. The problem is this 'light touch' they keep saying basically means 'we can't do anything'
$C: Did not know that, I don't use iOS 
$C: What's NN? I'm not up on that lingo lol
$C: The investigation was closed before any formal factual or legal finding and there was a settlement in which the company agreed to stop discriminating against voice over IP traffic and to make a $15,000 payment to the US Treasury in exchange for the FCC dropping its inquiry. -wikipedia

More like was resolved by saying sorry here's a bribe.
$C: I won't disagree that it would have been better posted after the vote, however as a human, I just turned on the livestream 20'ish minutes ago and came to reddit to check-up on the news of its proceedings.  As Spez and the admins are also human, I assume that because it was on their mind, they wanted to go ahead and write out their thoughts and communication to redditors as they were watching it as well.  
$C: > There's no point in posting this though before the vote

Literally the exact same point as posting it after the vote, since the vote is pure ceremony.
$C: He is so goddamn full of shit. Right now he's whining about 'hypocrisy' of Silicon Valley (Facebook, YouTube) etc using targeted ads and and filtering content. 

He is completely ignoring that they have few other ways to monetize content. The ISPs, by providing to the end-user, are the only ones that really do have a means to profit. They're already the apex predator of the internet ecosystem and he's gonna give them *more* power? 

Fucking shill.
$C: I couldn't make it that far, a liberty is in the process of dying and I can't listen to it scream as the knife cuts it's throat.
$C: Yeah if anything it’s the power grids that are strained by it.
$C: I think the insinuation is that he wants to know the metadata regarding bitcoin transactions.
$C: From what I heard, it honestly wouldn't surprise me if that was no joke.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Nah, they were making them leave everything, only taking their bodies out. Camera guys had to leave their cameras, everything. Hell, they even said they couldn't take their coats. 
$C: I would agree but violence will get us nothing until we have a more stable public voice. With the divides between race, gender(LGBT), gun control(ironically when we are talking overthrow the government), and even things like prolife/choice. Even if we could get somewhere with violence it would just fall apart in a few months when the radicals from each group try to reset again. 
$C: Or we could work harder to get power in government after getting waylayed in 2016. There aren't really any finish lines in our system.
$C: Well, you can close the blinds to a picket line, but it's kinda hard to ignore a rock flying through your window.
$C: In the immortal words of Roadhog "Violence is usually the answer" 
$C: I don't think Net Neutrality is *that* important.
$C: Pai just finished speaking I think
$C: You’ve misjudged me for the last time for now I shall show you my[trap card ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtwiMmSXow) 

*Link is Safe for work*
$C: Dude
$C: How do you think I know he's lying? We got a room full of files on him.
$C: I 
$C: I thought so. Not sure why people started using "yay" instead.
$C: Same here. I got inbox messages calling me all sorts of things for saying this current tactic is stupid and useless. Calling a voicemail? Emailing a spam box? Wow! That will show them! Not. 
$C: People also don't get that the only reason protests have power is because they are an inherent threat of violence. If a thousand people march in the street but that's all they are willing to do, then there is no incentive to go against them except for publicity/political imaging issues.
$C: [removed]
$C: "Purge the old blood" as Machiavelli would say.
$C: Historically speaking, that kind of action has led to the most corruption by far, and has killed hundreds of millions of innocent people.
$C: Are you kidding me? You want these people to fear death? So you want to incite violence? 

No. 

How about people understand what each party stands for and **vote** in elections? Alabama is proof that voter participation is extremely important. 

Our constitution has given us immense power that we waste by not being educated or involved enough. And when things don’t go the way we want them to, we get angry & disappointed & incite violence? 

America isn’t that corrupted yet where actual federal and state elections are being falsified. If it were, I would agree with you that violence and a civil war is needed. 

All of this is caused by lack of voter participation. At this point, blame the 40% of the country who didn’t vote in 2016. 
$C: Net Neutrality was, literally, the system stepping in to fix our problems and keep the internet free. Advocating disengagement is simply advocating for the Trumps and Pai's of the world to have even more free reign.
$C: How about voting the people who are making these changes out of office?  You still can vote, right?  Lol jk they touched our precious internet, let's start a war.  
$C: [deleted]
$C: Lol, so you want to kill people now because you think you might have to pay extra for netflix? Maybe you should stop talking for a while, champ.
$C: you're talking about natural death, right? like corrupt politicians dying of old age?
$C: We can't condone the murder of these people. I hate them too, but we should strive for law, order and incarceration. 
$C: Robespierre did nothing wrong!
$C: To shreds you say? 
$C: Then came Napoleon.
$C: r/LateStageFeudalism
$C: Slicey slicey
$C: Hahaha let's kill those who disagree with me

WTF WHY WON'T THEY DO WHAT I WANT

🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
$C: I won't lie, I'd get a feeling of savage pleasure from watching Pai getting tar and feathered.
$C: What works to to take away the money.  Don't buy from big companies when you can and buy local from employee owned and buy from single individuals and families.  Avoid Amazon and turn off the tv and it's ads.  Say no to more wars and the militarization of the police.  Say no to politicians funded by wall st. And big money. We must fund our own people.  They cannot have our hard earned money to play with and turn around and cheat us.  

The good guys are out there, we need to get behind them.  Dems and Repubs are the same now effectively.   More choices, more parties, more liberty.  Too late for the old party grudges,  we need to get together fast before it's too late.

$C: Dollar signs are way more effective here than bullets.  - Edit due to negative rating. I never thought id have to defend my comment about using money instead of killing fellow Americans over this. Just so you know, I am furious over this too... come on, 80 percent of people wanted something and it was ignored? Sure, it shows that the FCC is insanely corrupt and needs change. But honestly, I feel like taking up weapons (which is exactly what the two people I replied to are wanting, despite the fact that they say "This is not a call to violence, ..but..." and "I don't condone violence, but...") would end up costing you so much more than trying to play within the system. I honestly don't know Ajit Pai's life story, but he most certainly did not rise to his position by writing letters to his congressman or leaving voicemails to some temp who just pressed delete, he probably used every tool he had at his disposal - including money and underhanded tactics. I'm not advocating we should *HAVE* to use such despicable tactics (it's corrupt) , but it seems like a better option than literally removing these people from life/office with guns. Also, how many of you're neighbors will take up arms with you over this? Yes, it's been said that 80 percent of Americans supported Net Neutrality... would you really want to test that number though? Do you think that 80 percent could *really* tell you what NN actually is? And of that 80 percent, how many are going to back you up when you march on the FCC's headquarters? We live in a time of corruption, but we also live in a time of unprecedented peace. It's just my opinion that if you want to throw down with these people that it might be best to use their own tactics instead of revolt.
$C: This guy is a mod at r/NoNetNeutrality.

Don't feed the trolls.

$C: I’m in full agreement with you, but we can’t just go out alone and commit random acts of violence. That’s not how you get a message across.
$C: Well sure bro, but what did you do? You're saying you hold "all of" us in contempt for our supposed inaction, so enlighten me regarding what violent uprising you participated in
$C: I agree with you. What people nowadays don't seem to grasp in their comfortable complacency is that for things to change we need to shed that moral superiority of 'peaceful protest' and realize that we have to get our hands as dirty as them. 
$C: It's one thing to type all of this up, it's another thing to actually do it.
$C: Yeah violence was a last resort though. Extreme cases do need violence. You can’t incite violence after voter participation dips. 
$C: You are unhinged. Time to back away from the ledge.
$C: You're wrong, I know plenty of vets that are liberal or have no political ideology at all. They genuinely want what's best for the country and recognize that the people in power don't represent them either.
$C: You're an idiot
$C: Thank you for clearing that up. I kept wondering why whenever I put on my boots in the morning I'd get a sudden urge to impose a fascist dictatorship.
$C: Yeah, let's wait for that 🙄
$C: "Let's not use violence yet. Let's wait until it's literally impossible to resist the tyrannical government to use violence. That'll work."
$C: I never said murder. I said revolution.
$C: This is another in a string of many matters.

Eventually, one of the straws will break the proverbial camel's back.

This is just the one for him.
$C: The fact that over 80% of the nation supports net neutrality, yet these guys are still tearing it down goes against everything this country was built on. It's no longer a democracy.
$C: The government is involved in your internet to prevent monopolistic internet providers from monitoring your every move and from throttling content that doesn’t make them money AT YOUR EXPENSE. 

It’s involved in your internet to protect you from corporate greed, you fucking idiot. This is the most simplistic thing ever to grasp. 
$C: The Internet moves quicker than anyone could have predicted. In 20 years it has gone from a luxury to a necessity. It's all but replaced the need for print media, television and radio. The law was in place to safeguard the future of the most important human achievement in the last 100 years. People are outraged and rightfully so. How can you not see this? I just don't understand this narrow mindset and willingness to overlook that these fuckwads have ignored the will of the people and are openly in the pocket of large businesses. 

Edit: nevermind just noticed you're an avid T_D wanker. Logic and reason will not prevail here. 
$C: Net neutrality is the implied norm. Before 3 years ago, it was expected that you could access any part of the net with no throttling. Then the powers at be abused their power. So it's not a law that was in place for only 3 years. It has always been in place and only recently needed government intervention. Your argument is like saying that killing was ok before it was banned via the 10 commandments (I'm not religious, just using it as an example). Obviously it was bad before. 
$C: doesnt matter. the FCC should not be passing sweeping laws/legislation when they are not elected. This should have fallen to congress to act on, which would allow voters and constituents a clearer voice to those in power. Since the FCC has no repercussions directly to us, they dont care. 
$C: MLK wouldn't have had success had his peaceful protests not had violent protests to back them up (Malcolm x and other violent) so I don't disagree with you but I'm not getting banned for trying to incite violence (but I agree with you... shhhh)
$C: [deleted]
$C: Americans currently don't have the guts to become violent, our lives are too comfortable to demand change 

Edit: By all means though, prove me wrong, people. Show society that you're ready to back up your revolutionary spirit with action. Actual action.
$C: same, how long are we gonna sit back and be used, how long are we gonna rely on a broken system. we gonna expect our kids to fight the war for freedom? to end corruption? i hate people and their childish mind that doing the righteous thing will end up working 
$C: Violence to what degree though? I personally don't want people to go out and start attacking or killing others. We gotta be better than that.
$C: Amen brother.

At what point do you my American friends say enough is fucking enough? You've seen where peaceful discussion has gotten you time and time again. THEY. DON'T. GIVE. ONE. SINGLE. FUCK. It's time to march, physically remove, incarcerate, and bar all these corrupt politicians from ever coming back.
$C: #Rise 

We need to start a trend. We need a movement along with it
$C: Oh yes, if I can't have government regulating what ISPs get broadcasting rights every year, then no one gets internet, just brilliant.

You should do it. Pretty surethat'll be 10 years, a felony charge, and $100k fine. GLHF
$C: Lol yes, costing isps money will surely get them to expand their networks like we want them to!
$C: I'm surprised nobody has. You got mentally crazy folks who will shoot people because they can't get laid, you think some mentally broken person wouldn't shoot some people over the internet? The internet is like the crutch and support of many ill people so it makes you wonder. Imagine how many paranoid and unhinged people feel like their kind have been specifically targeted. 
$C: Honestly? They’ll raise fee’s and file it under “maintenance”. You’ll also be hurting neighbors who work from home. This won’t hurt the shareholders pockets like you think. You’ll be hurting people who are also upset about it.

Canceling your internet is definitely the way to go. It’s time to actually ask yourself, “can I protest by inconveniencing myself for what could be up to 3 months?” Those who absolutely need the internet will have to have it. That’s ok. But those of us who Netflix, YouTube, etc. only can just stop.

$C: Martin Luther King wouldn't have been successful without Malcolm X, and even King at the end was doubting his peace-only ideals.
$C: This is ridiculous and dangerous, plus misleading.

Republicans and their wealthy supporters got us here in less than one year of their party controlling all three Federal branches.

That's it: voting has consequences.  There is no suicide clause in the Constitution to allow violent overthrow as a means of correcting bad voting behaviors.
$C: Someone get this kid a chill pill. 

If you actually think violence is the only option, you are just as bad as the people you want to hurt. 
$C: I hope you know you're part of the problem too. If you're so invested in this cause then go to the parliament or whoever is in charge of this and shoot them up. Go die for your convictions. But you will not do it because you're a filthy coward.
I'm french and I'm watching this from my country where we have high speed internet and internet neutrality. I'm so amused. 
Get lost, loser. A big mouth but that's it, no action to back it up. The only violence is the one you're doing with your fingers behind your computer. 
$C: So what did you do ? I actively told many people about this and got the word out to many friends and family and let them know. The vote has now been made now this calls for different means. So get out of hear unsung reddit warrior who saved us sheeple from the big bad fcc get off the high horse douche. 
$C: Because you are a brave People's Hero who lost his life in the Great Internet Uprising of 2017. Get a grip.
$C: Have we not had that since we became a country ?
$C: Well obviously voting but that may not work.
$C: I'm not advocating violence at all, but I doubt that's actually true. The people who despise Trump & co. and the people who are neutral vastly outnumber his actual supporters. Only 54.2% of voting age Americans participated in the 2016 election, and even then the hard number of people that stood behind him—illustrated by the popular vote—was the minority. His support has dwindled to comically low numbers since then.

I don't think enough people still support Trump to prompt open civil war. I think a very loud minority still support him because they're *literally insane people*, but that *most* Americans are either still apathetic or dislike him and his administration.

But I still don't condone violence, regardless.
$C: A revolution could also *very easily* turn bad and bring about horrifying results. Just look at what happened to Russia. 

People here have the impression that donning their mall-ninja gear and shooting their Mosin-Nuggets and 10/22s at duh gubmint will solve everyone's problems and there will be paradise. In reality, if they did that they'd just get annihilated by the National Guard (see: Waco), and if there *was* a real revolution millions will die and those who were left likely won't get what they wanted.

^^I ^^AM ^^A ^^BOT^^^beep^boop!
$C: Revolting with 70% of the population opposing the administration (now) is a bit different from revolting with 70% of the population supporting the administration (last administration). Highly false equivalency.
$C: I'd like all recent administrations to have been revolted against. I haven't liked any of them.
$C: How did we get the Constitution? It was brought into being after the Articles of Confederation failed, leading to a national deficit and eventual rebellion against the government. Well, holy shit, how did the Articles of Confederation come into being? They were brought into being after the Revolutionary War, with one of the main reasons for said Revolution being the overtaxation of the colonies by Great Britain. And what is the lynchpin document that many consider the collected spirit of that age? The Declaration of Independence. And what is one of the strongest lines from said Declaration? That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that.

The Framers of the Constitution didn't put in the Constitution that the people have a right to overthrow the government if the government does them wrong because they had already said it eleven years beforehand. 
$C: We do have the right to overthrow, but going through courts and congress to prevent these kinds of things is better. It would probably take much more than this for it to be considered tyrannical.
$C: One of the guys who sold us out on the board looked to be 35. 

$C: Is this an original thought, or a quote?

Because I may steal it.
$C: Soap??
$C: Has anyone ever successfully started and finished a socialist or communist revolution in a democracy, though? Wouldn't a democracy effectively prevent revolution for exactly the same reason you suggested- that those in such a society think they have control through an election, and that the election outcome will significantly change the country. 
$C: Peaceful protest isn't going anywhere. People in this thread are (justifiably) angry and venting their frustrations. I doubt very many people here would actually be capable of shooting at some 20 something who joined the national guard to get his college paid for. Certainly not enough to foster any kind of revolution.
$C: Odds go up if it’s a suicide mission. 
$C: Yeah I'm pretty sure England considered the founding fathers criminals too, that's how revolution works
$C: I want to see him in jail, out of power, and then publicly hanged by an Ethernet cable.
$C: Go after the corporations instead
$C: I'd be shocked if we weren't already at war with russia if Shillary was president.
$C: You think Hillary would have supported Net Neutrality? She's a bribe-guzzling whore, the only difference is that public uproar might have made her back down.
$C: So you actually believe that the current congress will not only pass anything, but will actually create and pass a law that protects NN? If so then I'd like to sell you some beachfront property in Arizona.

This kind of action should be met with severe consequences, and if the people in charge will not stop this kind of behavior or hand out punishment, then that falls on the people.
$C: > It first started as the land of the free. 

Dude, this country was started by people literally owning other people.
$C: The land of the free .... for white men who owned property. Face it pal, this place was *never* free. People just drank the propaganda juice more readily because it was easier to pull the wool over people's eyes. Now it's not. It's not that things have changed, it's because people are finally cluing into what's up.
$C: Tell that to Ireland. Up the RA.
$C: I'm all for legal and just consequences and also feel Pai (and the other two lackey's) deserve to be investigated.  I hope they're found guilty and punished accordingly through our legal system.  I just don't want to advocate violence.
$C: Hitman games: kill certain people, make big changes. 

Of course noone is a perfect assassin, but you don’t need a revolution from everyone. 
$C: If there's one thing I've learned to rely on more than a company doing anything in its power to mindlessly aggregate as much money as possible it's peoples' willingness to jump straight to calls for bloody vengeance when they get upset.
$C: the women's march was a jerk-off.  It was about nothing and accomplished exactly nothing.  It made headlines for a week that is all.   The corrupt people in power probably laugh when they see people with signs and chanting tired slogans "hey hey ho ho blah blah blah has got to go", while the fly first class to their Summer homes.  I agree with the sentiment here that violence is the only way to guarantee any change or accountability.  MLK was wrong.  Everyone likes to hold up the famous non-violence proponents MLK /  Gandhi etc, they conveniently forget all the great political thinkers especially from the enlightenment who understood the importance of violence.
$C: Today you learned your vote is literally meaningless.

$C: The vast majority of people don't vote, especially in midterm elections and primary elections.
$C: Pai was appointed by a Republican Congress during the Obama administration 
$C: Yeah I mean I have Ted Cruz.  It works on 100% humans who are not the zodiac killer sometimes.  

Either way, they want our votes, they won't get them if they don't listen to us.
$C: **Ajit Pai**

Ajit Varadaraj Pai (born January 10, 1973) is an American attorney who serves as the Chairman of the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC). He is the first Indian American to hold the office. He has served in various positions at the FCC since being appointed to the commission by President Barack Obama in May 2012, at the recommendation of Mitch McConnell. He was confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate on May 7, 2012, and was sworn in on May 14, 2012, for a five-year term.

$C: Gas prices also change identically as soon as another gas station's prices change. They're matching competitors' prices. Telcos in the USA have the ability to collude but they don't.
$C: Unfortunately I vented some of my frustration that I had for the rest of Reddit at you, so sorry if that seemed a little aggressive. But yeah, I just think it's been a little over-hyped as the end of the world, when really things will at least be similar to normal
$C: You aren't wrong, that's a great point. But let me ask this: did they do that before net neutrality was enforced?
$C: Spoken like a true liberal... 
$C: States, but in the county and cities there are even more. States aren’t the only people who can do this.
$C: Ajit Pai will be heading there himself eventually. It's just going to take a bit longer. 
$C: It's obvious that the only thing that can work is voting, because that's all we can do to kick the assholes out of office if they don't do our bidding.
$C: A riot would work. A large one. 
$C: No bot. No bot. You're the bot.
$C: Well then we could order him some pizza. He must be hungry after fucking 300 million people.
$C: I legit wouldn't mind if someone killed both him and all other people behind this
$C: i was just talking about the FCC commissioners. take a wild guess which two didnt vote to repeal.
$C: My only issues boil down to access to anime art and good connection for multiplayer games which isn’t really good writing material. I live in Canada so I can’t go out and vote in the US. 
$C: I had to keep editing to get my name to appear on the first page, so a lot I wanted to say I had to remove, but I was able to send a letter to the 3 bastards that voted yes and my local congressman (a Rep.). Thanks for making your site. Worked very well.
$C: Good bot
$C: I'm not saying I advocate for such things, but it would not surprise me for Pai to wake up next to a Horse head on some morning.
$C: Surgical strikes, precision assassinations, not mass riots and massacres. 
$C: I will hug him and kiss him and call him George-bot. 
$C: Ajit Pai , sure but the two other  , IDK .
$C: What other shit do people like that net neutrality supporters hate?
$C: You have perfectly described our current political system
$C: I called their office, and they basically got me off the phone as fast as possible. 



Fuck you Tillis. 
$C: Senator Burr lives on the same street as my parents. I would love to run into him over the holidays. 
$C: I'm only in favor of capital punishment for capitalists.
$C: "The conditions for revolution do not have to exist prior to the revolution; a revolt can bring them about"

-Che

Not that I would be advocating for any sort of violence or anything that could possibly violate Reddit's TOS, but I do advocate for a diversity of tactics, if you catch my drift.
$C: r/overwatch
$C:  What about theirs? 
$C: Lol this isn't a democracy and never has been. It's a representative ~~democracy~~ republic, wherein you delegate your democratic authority by electing a representative. And guess what? The representatives elected by the people of the United States of America in 2016 were in favor of the repeal of Net Neutrality. If you don't want people to do things you don't like, maybe try voting for the other guy instead of getting buyer's remorse. They did exactly as advertised, just like Trump is.
$C: Hasn't been for awhile.. I will admit a large amount of the downfall of our political system is due to mentally sedated Americans. And I will be the first to admit I'm one of them using the "there's nothing I can do anyway, so I'll just turn my back to all political issues" as one of my more politically inclined friends put it today. This hopefully will be the wakeup call to all Americans who shy away from political matters. Because I know for me at least it has, there's only so much power we can allow the government to take away from us before it's irreversible and I will say we are walking a thin line at this point.
$C: Well no. Elected officials care about keeping their jobs. They don't care that 80-90% of Americans want net neutrality because they don't feel like it will motivate voters to vote them out. They also know that most of the people who care deeply are never going to vote Republican anyway, so they don't matter. Voting them out is literally the only power we have. Calls, letters, etc, only matter if they think it will motivate people to vote for or against them in the next election.
$C: This guy gets it. 
$C: Feel free to use some alternative tactics, wink wink nudge nudge.
$C: Say what you will about the Democrats, but false equivalency on the issue of Net Neutrality is the true joke. Never forget, Net Neutrality protections were enshrined under a Democrat, and have now been repealed under a Republican. 

This isn't an issue you can just say "Oh but if the Democrats were in power they'd do the same thing" because the Democrats WERE in power and they did the exact opposite just two years ago.
$C: Ajit Pai was raised to the level of Chairman by Trump. Clinton would not have appointed him to that level as he's staunchly conservative.
$C: When you have to choose between two shit sandwiches, you pick the smaller one.
$C: [C'mon man](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/7xwknx/republican-members-of-congress-fcc-letter). You're pushing false equivalency with no facts. 
$C: So you can't tell the difference between them? It takes a lot of willful blindness to hold a position that wrong. 

You just watched Republicans repeal net neutrality, try to take away people's healthcare, and pass a massive tax cut for the rich and you say you can't tell the difference between the two?  

When you can't accurately diagnose the problem, you can't fix it. You're not helping America fix anything when you ignore reality. 
$C: I wonder what his endgame is
$C: I think there's a [37% chance](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/) you're right. 
$C: They don't care about us.
$C: vary astute response did your Russian mother teach it to you?
$C: Sorry, I'm not sure what you're implying.

How else do you think government representatives know what their constituents want?
$C: Well the whole fastlane argument is pretty much just fearmongering. You'd run into lawsuits and potential FTC rulings over anticompetitive practices while potentially losing customers. Especially when ISPs can simply charge heavy usage companies for direct infrastructure connections or space on CDNs for faster connections without worrying about lawsuits or loss of consumers. Which the existing infrastructure of companies like google and netflix is a huge advantage in speed and delivery compared to any startup even with the neutrality rules.

Title II fears have vastly slowed VOIP solutions because of fears of having to conform to every telephone regulation - things like needing location information for every skype call in case of emergency calls, connection to every relevant 911 service while preventing fake untrackable 911 calls and telephone pricing restrictions as a utility.

You also have future services like [remote surgeries](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140516-i-operate-on-people-400km-away) which require fast high bandwidth connections that would violate net neutrality principals (because having the connection lag during a surgery could mean killing a patient).

And while the much hated pricing tiers for packages seem to be the main headline we've seen cell phone competition slowly push each other toward more and more unlimited internet. In fact, rather than price increases for current plans you're more likely to see lower price plans say for low income families who don't need streaming video. You'd be looking at something that lets kids in low income families do school assignments and research with a home internet connection where the family wouldn't be able to afford the current internet plans. Many of these families are types where they have cell phone monthly plans that they can barely make payments on might find an internet plan they can afford. That's not a benefit?

Also on the aspect of competition rural areas have a tough time finding competition, but anything more urban really shouldn't be considered a monopoly market. There is plenty of room for competition to come in, many towns are trying to force municipal broadband into the realm. But lets look at google fiber in say nashville. Is the problem with their entering the cost of the fiber lines? Mmm not really [according to google](https://fiber.googleblog.com/2016/09/to-nashville-with-love.html). It's problems with actually being able to touch the lines on the poles due to government regulation preventing them. It's almost like government regulation is preventing competition.

To say companies can now slow down or block consumer access on a whim is a complete lie. Doing so would violate the payment contracts their customers have made and pave the way forward for a large variety of lawsuits depending on how it's done.

This is all on top of allowing a non-elected agency to set rules for the entire industry instead of letting elected representatives who answer to the people pass a law. On that principal alone is enough to say the legislation would be superior to FCC verdicts.

If you can't understand the side you are arguing against how can you ever hope to persuade someone?
$C: Dollar bills
$C: what baffles me is that you americans are letting this happen, yes, you as a collective is responsible for these people, and it is hurting the whole world. as always. fuck america
$C: Well said. Any info on how this agency was originally put together. I'm older than 12 years old so I know the FCC existed before Obama was in office. When was it created?


$C: Do you hear the people sing, singing the songs of angry men?
$C: I'm in. 
$C: Well it *does* make for a great sarcastic Reddit comment
$C: [deleted]
$C: I'm studying that guy in AP European history rn. Cool stuff :)
$C: You're a kid aren't you
$C: Remember to wash your fedora. 
$C: I upvoted... (it's also to the left)
$C: Neither will you, retard.
$C: Really? Do you feel like you have a say in what happens in your country?
$C: Sigh a country can be a representative democracy and a republic. Unless you think there isn't a difference between the USA and the republic of china.
$C: Republican citizens care about a free internet too. Their representatives will cave in with enough pressure.
$C: Uhm, yeah? Votes were party line, how is he wrong?
$C: thats just an objective verifiable fact. 
$C: This was explicitly in the party platforms.  Clinton even had a page dedicated to net neutrality on her campaign site and spoke publicly about it.

Trump (and the GOP) is against net neutrality and it was a forgone conclusion he would appoint someone to do the deed.

https://gizmodo.com/the-2016-presidential-candidates-views-on-net-neutralit-1760829072

$C: News flash....the FCC answerable to the executive branch (whispers....that's the president). Guess who is NOT the fucking president?...Hilary Clinton.
$C: that chart looks pretty simple to me. Just for clarity, I dont disagree with you on NN, but nothing here looks like television armageddon to me.

As someone who has NEVER paid for premium movie channels, I have always enjoyed my lowered cable bill. If my ISP gave me features and services I can opt out of in exchange for paying them less, I would actually like that.
$C: I pay 10€/month for internet only near Paris. And I have a lot of choice. I guess it's because comunism.
Good luck in your land of oportunity.
$C: > I feel like emigrating is more difficult than it should be

If it wasn't difficult, places would get overrun by economic migrants. Start a thread on an appropriate subreddit asking for info on how to emigrate. Evaluate you and your girlfriend's professional skills, and what you would be willing to learn if needed (such as language in addition to job skill, since not all countries have a lot of English speakers). Basically you need to see what countries are you able to get into based on your current (or maybe potential) skills? and whether you would be willing to move there. Then learn about the process for specific countries
$C: India just got the strongest Net Neutrality laws in the world.

$C: Come to Canada. We welcome one and all. Just be sure your are ready for the cold, snow, and kitchen parties. 
$C: Sadly many other countries are certainly going to adopt removing net neutrality if it genuinely is repealed.
$C: Belgium? The Netherlands? It's famously easy to immigrate to The Netherlands as an expat. Then Belgium seems to be the chillest nation on the planet.
$C: Come to Finland! Lol ok maybe not, it might not be the best country for you, but when it comes to most things internet, we have a pretty good situation. Fast unlimited mobile data plans start at less than 15€/mo and add another 15 and you'll get decent enough home internet as well. Our most expensive internet plans cost less than your monthly 71$ bill. Only downside is that fibre hasn't seen as wide adaptation as one might wish (my family lives in a suburb in the capital area and we don't have fibre). It's also very safe here, and we're apparently one of the happiest countries in the world (although that may not be quite apparent at first glance). But enough of my nationalist propaganda ;) , I'd say the other Nordic countries are quite viable options too. They are slightly smaller countries though, so if that's not your thing you might want to look elsewhere. I'm not very familiar with our immigration policies, but I'd bet that if you're well-educated and willing to work, there's a good chance you'd be quite welcome.

Edit: I noticed you have a degree in Japanese and your gf knows Chinese? Now I'm not 100% sure about this but I think I recall there being a big demand for people fluent in Asian languages here. But like I said I wouldn't necessarily take my word for this.

Also, even though Finnish and Swedish are our official languages, at least in Helsinki and here in the south most people know English and you can get away with it just fine. Plus, at many workplaces, especially more international companies, English is definitely the language of conduct. 
$C: Christ. Remember that people are trying to scare you with absolute worst case scenarios of what will happen without net neutrality while providing no proof. Have some backbone and chew on some logic before letting a bunch of shrill idiots uproot you from your country because of what their paranoid minds think will happen. It'll be just like Cable TV and no one's starting revolutions or moving to other countries because of those price plans. 
$C: I'm more interested in giving my family and children the best lives I can, whether that's in the US or not 
$C: You mean exactly like the "white-flight" that occurred in cities across the country because of racist policies and fear mongering? Often times precipitated by greedy politicians who touted "trickle down economics" who never missed a chance to enact regressive legislation. You mean exactly like we have seen happen for over 40 years in this country?
$C: I mean compared to what a MAJORITY of people who use the internet go on, Reddit is fringe.

Regulatory Capture.

There isn't a free market for the internet now, repealing net neutrality will not help, the corporations own all the lines/poles.  The only way I see to really have a free market is to have the government (federal or individual municipalities) own and maintain the physical internet cabling and rent it to corporations who want to provide internet service, or mandate that the companies that currently own the physical part of the infrastructure will sell bandwidth to any corporation that can pay at a wholesale rate.  There is no reason that I should only have two choices of ISP, (and many people only have one), but my local ISPs have no incentive to resell their bandwidth to someone who wouldn't keep "raising my internet speed and cost of service to serve me better" (and refused to keep me at the old speed and price, which was working fine for me) . There's nothing profound about this.  This person is describing the "assume a spherical cow" version of the free market.  We don't have a free market.  We have corporate socialism.
$C: Thanks for info. This guy posted the exact same message on my comment too
$C: I know right.
$C: Actually the CSA seceded pre-emptively before an abolitionist could pass abolition laws.
$C: Why does this have downvotes? Who knows. It’s the only logical comment here. 
$C: Get ready for that to either suck or cost more, too...
$C: So your not gonna try? If youre not gonna try to change it then why complain at all?

Basically these companies youre complaining about are trying to put their dick in your butt and youre just complaining instead of fighting back.

Youre submitting to something you dont want without even trying to fight back.
$C: Did you also refer your users to battleforthenet.com?
$C: Now that's interesting.
$C: I can't find where to send letters on battleforthenet. Would you link to it?
$C: Good bot. Now give me gold
$C: i plan to lower my internet service as soon as possible. If they start limiting broadband here in texas just like comcast i will rip my ethernet cable out.
$C: You do good work. Last week I wrote to my congressmen 4 or 5 times, sayi [PLEASE NOTE YOU HAVE USED YOUR DAILY ALLOTMENT OF REDDIT. TO GAIN ACCESS TO THIS AND DOZENS OF OTHER COMMENTS, PLEASE UPGRADE TO XFINITY OMEGA. FOR ONLY $9.99 A MONTH (as an introductory rate for the first 3 months) YOUR READING ALLOTMENT WILL BE DOUBLED, AND POSTING WILL BE TRIPPLED!]
$C: I didn't see the op's comment was a bot and thought he was calling you /u/Senior-Jesticle a good bot
$C: Some sort of open hardware running a blockchain web protocol on openbts in mesh? I’m high idk something like that 
$C: I have an idea that someone could do:

Form a non-governmental organization to use collective bargaining power to make it too costly for ISPs to bother to mess with their customers' internet connections.

Instead of paying Comcast, you pay the organization and they use that to pay your bill and deal with Comcast for you.

If you don't like the job the organization is doing, you drop them and pay Comcast directly.

If you do like the job the organization is doing, you stick with them.

The organization would be able to negotiate the fine print to ensure that "Net Neutrality" are included in the terms. The new 2017 rules do allow the FTC to go after the ISPs if they lie about their service, so there would be a method of enforcement.

So, even without any new infrastructure being built or laws being changed, we could have some competition!

And since Comcast is a pain in the butt to deal with anyway, even if/when the 2015 order gets reinstated, whoever does this, if their customer service is good, will still have a profitable company on their hands as people would rather deal with them than their cable provider.

Thoughts?
$C: Yeah I’m not spending my money on something I know my state reps don’t give a shit about
$C: You know this is one of those subjects that no matter who explains it to me from which side it's completely confusing you don't even know which side to be on which is how I feel most people think about it. It's like CNN and fox both say the exact opposite
$C: Officially done with Reddit after today. Fuck this bullshit, they're the corporate assholes and you guys are to dumb to realize it. You all were weaponized in a political frenzy and quite frankly it was disgusting and just turned people from your "cause". **EDIT well my karma is to low to reasonably reply to comments anymore. Good look with the Apocalypse!
$C: Luke Dies, Leia Lives, Kylo Kills Snoke,Rey isn't Luke's Daughter
$C:  ^^^^^^ to this. Voting - ok fine, but we have so much more power to directly affect our lives than we realize. Mesh networks (for densely populated areas at the very least) are a no-brainer. We can call our congress peeps because why not, and then get down to the real work of taking the power away from ISPs. 
$C: Yes yes YES! I would SO get behind this. We could build a new Internet and give the FCC a huge "FUCK YOU!"
$C: [deleted]
$C: When you say mesh networks are you referring to the logical topology of the network such as full mesh and partial mesh, or are you talking about something else entirely?
$C: Good points made here.
$C: How would we get people to use these mesh networks?
$C: I just stumbled across the Substratum project for a decentralized internet. Looks very interesting, I will be researching more into this
$C: [AltheaMesh](http://altheamesh.com/), [RightMesh](https://www.rightmesh.io/), [GoTenna](https://www.gotenna.com/) are all working on various mesh technologies. If anyone is interested in supporting efforts of this sort, feel free to DM me.
$C: Oooh yes
$C: BLOCKCHAIN OR BUST IN CRYPTO WE TRUST. wireless coverage everywhere, no downtime, payable by the second with microtransactions at a cost nearing zero because the products already exist, routers, phones, etc. just not quite the software and above ground wireless (baloons, satellites etc.)
$C: Good news is the FCC just repealed government involvement with the internet so we don't have to worry about china's problem ;)
$C: It's hard to attribute any altruistic motivations when Net Neutrality directly affects the bottom line of the company he's the CEO of and undoubtedly owns significant stock in. The reclassification to Title I could have serious consequences of the profitability of reddit, so it's not particularly surprising he would support NN.
$C: thank mr spez
$C: He edited one post that was talking complete shit about Spez himself. As soon as people saw it was edited, he admitted to it. It wasn't exactly a secret. Websites have no claim to free speech.

edit: Wow, what a great night to receive these downvotes.  I'd like to thank /r/the_donald for banning me when defending Hillary for talking about women and children as victims of war, /r/Uncensored_News for banning me just because I disagreed with one article, super proud of you neo-nazis. And finally, I'd like to thank /r/conservative for banning me because "We don't condone murderers here" on a Death Penalty thread, because I compared it to the pro-life side who don't care for the babies once they're born. You all have proven yourselves to hold free speech in such high regard, and are totally justified for the shit you give Spez. We should all be grateful that he doesn't just edit your groups off the website. 

Thank you all for being just so fucking shit. 
$C: I’m 100% happy that get neutrality has been repealed - NO GOVERNMENT REGULATION period.
$C: [deleted]
$C: >you've done a lot of good for the people in this world

*vomit*
$C: Or the exact opposite.  He took money to make a sub lean way to the left.  Alot of money.  I wonder how much was given for this issue.  It will all come out.  But likely you will bury your head in the sand.
$C: It's really funny to see you guys think you are tackling a big issue, when you literally have 0 say in any of this.








Redditors are not billionaire lobbyist 
$C: I just find it ironic how the CEO of Reddit is so pro freedom of speech and anti-censorship but then goes ahead and edits posts of members of the_donald because they offended him. Doesn't the whole point of free speech include letting people you disagree with speak?
$C: Might want to edit your bot text to say this, people could miss it.
$C: They won't write it for you, you have to write it yourself, but they fill in your info on a nice looking template and FAX not MAIL to your reps/senators.
Just for clarification. 
$C: Does this work though? Because I hear in the news fcc says they fet million of bots commenting.  I'm curious if it's from legit people using a bottled program?
$C: money hungry whores
$C: How about not being a pack of lazy cunts and using your fingers to help preserve what should be your rights, guys?
$C: People can also get out some damn paper and a pen and do it themselves.  


$C: good man
$C: No.
$C: What self respecting admin wouldn't delete others' posts?
$C: good end-user.
$C: Good admins would care about free speech.  All these admins care about is trying to shift the cost for their new video hosting service to the ISPs and they want the FCC to do their dirty work.

spez:/  Downvotes are what you get for speaking truth to power in the world of reddit.
$C: [removed]
$C: Reddit aggregates sites from all over the web, and as such (as a service) is completely neutered if sites posted aren't in the package of most users. Reddit more than most would feel the pain of a change like this because of the very core of the sites function. 
$C: Nope. Best they could do is offer to pay ISPs to get on more plans
$C: I need a couple shots of your username after this vote
$C: https://youtu.be/-Fyiv1LvR-A
$C: Don't worry no internet company did this before 2015 before the FCC passed the law that was just repealed people are freaking out over nothing. It's in a businesses best interest to provide the full internet to keep customers.

$C: They never did that prior to 2015 u soy boy 
$C: Shocking u/mailmygovNNBot is also owned by u/mailmygov who would've thought? 
$C: You're saying this like you've uncovered a conspiracy, but it's literally a bot whose purpose is to advertise a service, and that's all you just said. And of course the bot owner is the same? They just added letters onto their username for the bot. It's clearly not intended to be a secret. 

It's like if someone was wearing a political button and you pointed out that their intention was to raise awareness of a particular candidate. Yes, that's the point.

And it's doing a lot more than it has to just to advertise the service. That bot even posted alternative websites to help you do the same thing. I think it's a very good bot.
$C: How are they capitalizing by helping the fight?
$C: Do I...do I use the site?
$C: No way! This bot affiliated with u/mailmygov is actually advertising u/mailmygov! I just cannot believe it! This is the worst conspiracy since we uncovered the secrets of dihydrogen monoxide!
$C: Why the fuck even bother saving Net Neutrality when dickholes like you complain and cry when people use the net to provide useful niche services?
$C: lol i read "copypasta comments"
$C: Using bots is the Reddit way, these days.
$C: I don't see a problem in the creation of a service that neutrally profits off of political activism if it can generate political activism.

And $2 really isn't that bad.
$C: Language

Smh
$C: Let free speech stay what it is, fucking fascist.
$C: Under the current net neutrality legislation, the Donald has been legally heavily censored along with anything that’s not liberal, because google Facebook Twitter etc, run most of the internet now adays. The bill had a clause in it that allowed these platforms to censor without any liability of doing so, meaning if brietbart was completely taken down, they could not sue the big corporate tech companies for doing so. 
$C: But muh free speech

[Reddit defends against accusations of ad fraud and Trump censorship](http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/03/31/reddit-defends-against-accusations-ad-fraud-and-trump-censorship.html)
$C: I am a developer for [savethenet.today](https://github.com/gu-app-club/save-the-net). We offered a similar service three weeks ago. When we found out that https://battleforthenet.com was able to subsidize the cost for sending letters we immediately disabled our service. We charged the absolute minimum of $1.50 for each letter. We used https://lob.com to send mail. I am not sure how I feel about a service like this becoming popular when there is an evidently free competing service... but I can't complain that people are taking initiative.
$C: Where to and how is he doing? Just proves the point that nothings going to change here...
$C: Where to and how is he doing? Just proves the point that nothings going to change here...
$C: I’m actually well taken care of. My health insurance is fantastic and I have no student debt in my senior year... 

I’m fine, but why would I put my kids through the crap all of my friends are going through. Absolutely everyone I know is either in tough shape due to the costs of school or health insurance. There are countries that have much better solutions to this than the US. 

People like you is the reason we’re being held back.

Then US had the best medical equipment in the world... and then as soon as you need to use it you are forever in debt. Costs of delivering a baby can upward of 100k... other countries see this as basic necessity of life. A healthy and safe delivery of a baby should not be monetized like this. It’s absolutely insane. 
$C: > Did you vote last year?

sure, I voted and the candidate with the most votes lost, and now we're getting fucked by a group that wasn't even voted in
$C: All hail the machine overlords!
$C: Yes, but it belongs to the people.
$C: And the creator released it to the public open source, he knew the potential and power of the internet.
$C: At this point, it's less "political views" than "what I am paid to supposedly believe in order to make my donors richer". This isn't a political disagreement, it's corruption.
$C: I'm not sure why people have a problem with you saying "bomb threats are not okay." They're really not.
$C: Did you just get downvoted for suggesting it's bad to threaten someone's life? Lol
$C: ^^^<3
$C: Communism isn't the only other option.
$C: "And by hypothetical, I mean it has only happened a few times..."
$C: If there is a way for a company to make a profit they will do it.
$C: This. I would love to cut the fuckers off but my choices are spectrum or fair point only and I'm reliant on having internet to make my living. I feel powerless in this.
$C: I'm glad you capitalized it, because at this point it's a well-named but often misused brand. I don't have any say one way or the other, but laws like this should be handled by Congress, not the FCC. Everyone says the FCC isn't following democracy, but that's why you don't give FCC this type of power. Depending on who is in office, the regulations on communications can swing dramatically. 

Beyond just politicking, I personally see a fair use case for shaping internet traffic based on type of data. I am a cord cutter who also builds/designs web properties, so I care deeply about internet and internet issues. I, however, didn't see this same Reddit uproar when the United States deregulated DNS operations to the rest of the world, which I was opposed and does more possible damage to the First Amendment. DNS tampering is way more dangerous than pipe manipulation since technology will transform what the "pipe" actually is, but that doesn't matter if you don't have a roadmap to get to your destination. Did anyone have home mesh networking five years ago? Could we get gigabit speeds from wireless networks? Just the past year we've seen tremendous in-roads for conquering the "last mile" and I've seen newcomers enter the arena like broadband over powerlines. 

I firmly believe this will be a non-issue in five to 10 years and the torches will be out for something completely different, and I really don't want to increase regulation (which slows every industry down, not just public services) that could keep us from getting to future technologies. 
$C: What’s wrong with a content provider paying more because they use more bandwidth? Would you rather your cable provider charge you more because they can’t charge the content providers more? 
$C: We will have to be more vigilant for sure. Also nothing was stopping tiering with NN btw. The ISP just had to tell you about it. If they didn't under NN, it was an FCC issue. If they don't now, its an FTC issue. When it was an FCC issue it _was_ easier for the FCC to make the ISP do what the gov wanted due to the requirement of needing the broadcast license under title II. When its an FTC issue, I think its more of a penalty issue. 
$C: r/paidforwinrar probably has something to say about this
$C: He didn't have to appoint him and that's the point. 

So, now that you're aware of how that works, please don't spread this oversimplification that misinforms people anymore. 
$C: The same Obama who enshrined Net Neutrality into law so people would stop messing with it? Yea, let's blame it on that guy and not the GOP.

And btw, he had to appoint 2 Republicans by law.
$C: The implementation of NN in 2015 was "selling out the American people". Now we've regained our freedom.
$C: Then Don’t be racist
$C: Good info. Thanks
$C: How is your side any different? You're supporting the whims of even bigger businesses: Google (2nd biggest company in the world), Amazon (4th biggest company in the world), Facebook (8th biggest company in the world).

Please, shed some light onto how the net neutrality debate is the people vs. the corporations.

> cucked

Ok, haven't heard that since I ventured over to TD that one time.

$C: Yeah, that was a perversion of the founders' legacy much like whatever u/geemahon is proposing.

I don't see your point :\
$C: From a philosophical perspective, positive rights don't exist. You can't guarantee a good or service provided by an individual to someone else because that's a violation of the negative rights of the individual.

So unfortunately I'd have to agree that the "UN Declaration of Human Rights" is a philosophically and logically inconsistent pile of shit.

And legally (as far as I know, correct me if I'm wrong) no country is required to adhere to it, so it's completely meaningless.
$C: Yeah, the UN, the non-pile of flaming shit 

Makes perfect sense
$C: I...dont quite understand. Can you explain please?
$C: It should be, but shelter, food, and clean water are even more important, and there's no provisions for those.  
$C: > freedom of information SHOULD be a right

I agree, but it's going to be such a sticky thing to do, because it crosses into the business realm so much, and it can be argued that FOI only applies to information from the government, not Netflix or Reddit, and gotten around by saying there can be no restrictions on .gov sites, for instance.

Don't get me wrong, I am 100% for a free and open internet.  NN is a critical and necessary thing.  I'm just not very optimistic that even a Constitutional amendment would keep the greed at bay.
$C: STOP having kids.  Seriously.  STOP having kids.

Corporations depend on a constant influx of new consumers and cheap worker drones.  Governments depend on a constant influx of new taxpayers and future soldiers.  They NEED us, even if they are loathe to admit it.  They would have no power if not for us.

We, the general public, control the future population, and thus the future of this country.  This is one issue where each and every one of us has a vote.  This is not something that can simply be subverted by a corporation paying off a few politicians.  What could be more democratic than that?  I have cast my vote, a vote of "no confidence."  We need to go on strike.  We need to show a few years of empty classrooms, plummeting college enrollment, and evaporating military enlistments.

This requires no real action on your part.  No changes to your current lifestyle.  No confrontation with armed gov thugs.  No risk of injury or death.  No legal repercussions.  Just continue your life as it is now and don't reproduce.  Safe, easy, and 100% legal.
$C: Just make a new internet. There's projects started already. Look up hyperboria.net, it's one of many ideas. We need to start making our own resources we control, but also be mindful of defending them. 
$C: That's why we can bear arms. 
$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves. Violence was part of equal rights for Race and Gender. Violence stopped the Nazis and saved millions of lives. Violence created our Country and maintained it. It is a tool and in some situations it is the best tool for the job. This is one of those situations because all other avenues have been exhausted and the powers of the government themselves are being abused So there it is. There is the solution.     

I know you all won't listen and I know we will lose the internet because of it. I hope your ego and pretentious morality was worth us losing one the greatest wonders of the human world. My resentment is no longer just for the corrupt human garbage that pushed against Net Neutrality, but also now for all of you who allowed it to happen just because you didn't want to get dirty to clean up the filth.    

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: Well its proven time and time again we have no power in government, so why not take the fight to them literally?  
$C: [deleted]
$C: good thought process!

now apply it to gun control

now pretend you're an ISP and the government is telling you how you can and can't run your business


$C: What's your alternative? Socialism??
$C: Capitalism is horrendous and everyone has been indoctrinated into thinking it is superior. Also this bullshit republic, where they smugly ignore the will of the people anyway. 

We need a Julius Caesar type badly. 
$C: Well I was a child so I guess it checks out. 
$C: Hell on Earth...AKA eventually a dictatorship will happen by there being a power vacuum.
$C: good on paper, bad in practice?
$C: Anarchy, I don't want anarchy, nor do I want socialism or communism which are both failed ideas. We are experiencing the failed extreme of the far right, we don't need to go through the failed extreme of the far left next.
$C: A fantasy land. 
$C: Except in all the ways it has been. Like FEMA responding to national emergencies.


$C: Yeah those damn Americans liberating western Europe from the Nazis. Never been a force for good eh.
$C: Dude, The Republican Party has been doing much, much more harm than the DNC in the past 20 years. The DNC aren't great but don't just throw that aside in like the GOP actually cares. They don't give a fuck about small government.
$C: Ah yes. The false equivalence sprinkled with some BS to make it seem like it isn't false equivalence. And then you throw in the Libertarian party aka Republican party.
$C: [deleted]
$C: You're a dumbass. Public services ≠ government owning everything.
$C: This is classic R strategy, though. Don't like the government and think that it is inefficient, wasteful, corrupt, and doesn't help anyone? Let's run for government and then pass policies that are inefficient, wasteful, corrupt, and doesn't help anyone. Now we can truthfully complain about the government.
$C: > American Democrats are just about the most contradictory people on Earth; they want government to own everything, and be involved in every single facet of their lives, while bemoaning abuses of power, and institutional corruption. 

Those aren't contradictory.
$C: Republicans are textbook authoritarian

$C: It's hardly even gone in the negatives this year and I live in edmonton. Usually pretty cold.
$C: You're pathetic, self loathing will get you nowhere
$C: No,  where you actually get repercussions for harassing someone who doesn't deserve it.   

Big difference. 
$C: Yes, because clearly choosing to be a bigot is the rational choice here.
$C: Do you feel the need to call people trannies often? Honestly the law you're talking about doesn't really affect your life unless you're being an edgy prick. If you use the wrong pronoun just say sorry and say they and them. The non binary/ trans community is so small that it's extremely rare to deal with them irl too, so yeah. 
$C: Do you want to call someone a tranny?
$C: Haha well we don't want people like you so you can stay where you are :)
$C: I'd rather be a tranny than a toe sucker.
$C: Ikr bunch a pussies
$C: I think he's saying if it really came down to killing yourself, just don't and sell everything, leave, and travel or do something, literally anything, other than kill yourself. This is real talk though. I know there is the drive to stay with your family and not abandon them, but in the context of potential suicide you'd be leaving them anyway. So just take off and live life free from traditional woes.
$C: I live a pretty blessed life.  Just was suggesting if OP couldnt deal with life there are other options than ending it is all.  Travel can be done for very cheap if you want to. 
$C: One doesn't need to be wealthy to get off their computer for a moment, stop being a part of the circle jerk, and seeing that the world is still turning, people are still happy, the future still has great opportunity, and that bitter little tears from being worked up by a mob won't improve one's circumstances, but a change in perspective, no matter how small, may.
$C: Again, given the context of the OPs message we are not talking about the average person.  Most people do not post about not being able to handle life.  Given the impact of that opening sentence, the alternative to attempting to move is much worse no? 
$C: Not just aware of the suffering, but aware that no one will do anything about it. That's why they laugh and mock. There's zero consequences to anything they do. 
$C: So no fault to obama for creating ACA and causing the insane spike in insurance prices. No it's all trump right?
$C: His lack of a job habits 
$C: So if I understood right, because Trump might eventually remove the ACA, rates are going up? (Even though they were skyrocketing up under the ACA)
$C: Literally not one piece of that would do anything to this dude's healthcare so far, you realize that right
$C: You might want to find a better source of information than huffpo

Just a recommendation

$C: Vox? Seriously dude, come back to reality for a bit

$C: They’re removing itemized deductions for home equity loans (only rich people have) and limiting mortgage interest to 500,000 as opposed to the former $1 million loans, medical expenses > 2% of AGI, and state tax deduction in favor for a higher standard deduction and lower income tax rates. They also have raised the income level effected by AMT so it applies to people making OVER $1million instead of $250,000.

And if you haven’t noticed, if this impending ACA repeal was really coming down the pike they would have gotten rid of the ACA tax as well as the NIIT.
$C: !isbot azerbajani
$C: Actually gotta upvote. Jefferson said the tree of liberty must occasionally be watered with the blood of tyrants and patriots. I just hope that won't include my blood.
$C: Lol, no, i voted for the person that represented what i believe in. I dont look at the (R) or (D) next to someones name and just vote for the republican.. i vote differently on every issue and position. The way you presented this makes you seem very close-minded, there middle ground between positions. So i say again: i am a conservative, i oppose net neutrality, and for the sake of the country STOP MAKING ISSUES SO FALSELY BLACK AND WHITE. People like you are ruining the country by puting blanket terms over everything like "the conservatives", and "the liberals". Like jesus fucking christ, the groups arent a god damn hive mind.

Edit: wording.
$C: A here we see the venomous tribalist in their natural habitat.
$C: It's easy to do a yes vote when you know you'll lose. Then they get to seem like good guys without having to actually do anything. 
$C: cause republicans are in power..if democrats were the decider in all of this the money would be going their way. Are you really this fucking clueless. Why would they care about a democratic vote if it could do absolutely nothing.
$C: It Hurts their feelings 
$C: So, me bringing to light the upsetting notion that the people have no power, evidenced by decades of political abuse, and evident once again through the blatant ignoring of the public's desire to preserve net neutrality, is just some delusion.

Please tell me all about how your congressman didn't throw you under the bus in the name of money and special interests.

The only "power" the people have is with their feet and wallets.
$C: Alabama is an extreme  circumstance, given the gigantic disparity between the candidates. You usually don't see one candidate that is so much more despicable than the other. Also, don't think for a second that Doug Jones won't stab voters in the back. He won becauae he wasn't Roy Moore. Doesn't mean he's a savior.
$C: Nice fear mongering 
$C: Something something lib tears or something. I swear if Breitbart published an article that said committing suicide makes liberals cry there would be no MAGA supporters left. 
$C: I'm sure it is by now...

Was fighting against this 10+ years ago
$C: ...no it wouldn't. It'd simply be a matter of connecting those networks (Google, Facebook, etc) to the new internet.

Nobody would be so silly as to start everything from scratch.
$C: What if google just decided to make a new internet and ran it itself. Invited already existing websites over and offered new domains on it. I know it wouldn't be great to have a company control the new internet, but it would be better than the old money hungry government you have making decisions on it.
$C: Facebook and twitter can’t possibly be worse. 
$C: I would be ok with that, google and the ilk seem to be corrupt in a few ways.
$C: Still not down to put my ISP in the hands of essentially one person, even if it is Elon Musk. 
$C: He’s already working on it....see Spacex LEO satellite internet plan
$C: Non neutral internet could hinder progress in getting to Mars! Get on it Musky!
$C: I mean, is he not already?
$C: So you disagree with the American Revolution then? Or the French Revolution? Or fighting against the Nazi Regime in WW2? 


$C: Oh, you mean the Congress with a higher percentage of Republicans? Yeah, they don't give a fuck.
$C: Washington Post stream never went out you must be on something else 
$C: I can't view your command as I'm not Premium  or gold from you so i can't helpo
$C: More government regulation = bigger government and more power. Why do you want to give the government that if you believe the government is corrupt? (which I agree with)
$C: Did I make an opinion? I thought I asked a question.
$C: Oh yeah then, it doesn't bring anything at all
$C: And what good did it do? 
The game is rigged.
$C: did that one man get unbeaten?
$C: Oh, I didn't say the vote wasn't stupid--it is. It benefits only the ISPs, not the people, and it should be overturned by Congress.

But I'm not in agreement that any sovereign country should give up its sovereignty, ever. We (as a species) fight wars over that--for good reason (usually).
$C: Nah it isn't. Remember that many EU countries are driven somewhat sane many-party systems. While not perfect, EU should be relatively safe.  At least, in my country I believe it will not happen
$C: Jesus, you guys are fucking insane. 
$C: >the_donald poster

Go back to your containment sub
$C: “Minor” change is a bit of an understatement 
$C: Just a minor violation of an entire country's human rights, no big deal. May as well throw out the constitution and reassimilate with fucking Britain, at least our taxes would be lower. 
$C: And of all the people to listen to, Mitch McConnell. And this smug bastard was the best we got. Got it. 
$C: You are making a clear reference to his cultural heritage. Nobody is being fooled here. If he were white, you never would have referenced his face.
$C: There are a LOT of things an ISP can do if it wants. What things do we actually believe they WILL do and what is the basis for that belief?
$C: A few words:
Drones from almost a low orbit.
Jets.
Nukes.
Outside contractors.
You can’t win, only get yourselves and a bunch of innocents killed, then justify the gov cracking down harder against its citizens. People way smarter than most people set measures against allowing the system to fall. Who’s fault is this? Our parents and grandparents generation let all kinds of shit slide, which creeped and corrupted unchecked to duck up everything. By the time my generation was being born, it was already too late for the rights and freedoms our parents squandered.
$C: ^^^what ^^^does ^^^that ^^^R ^^^mean?
$C: I understand, I mean some people will eventually riot due to ya know, issues....but if its civil they will be more likely to listen, though not having corrupt presidential candidates would be incredibly helpful for this as well.

(seriously, Trump and Clinton as the last two, I wanted fucking Bernie as a president)
$C: Dont worry its just a t_d troll. Taking out your anger/talking to him is like hitting yourself with a stone. Just ignore.

$C: I was making a joke. The people saying that it hasn't been decided yet sound suspiciously similar to the people insisting that Bernie Sanders had a chance in the election last year.
$C: What is Pai dancing on the tables and rubbing his nipples before he votes?
$C: Explain to me how the current Net Neutrality rules benefit corporations.
$C: How about you form a coherent point.
$C: Only $1 per YouTube video viewed! What a great value!
$C: We at Comcast have noticed that you download large files for your work. This habit is clogging up our internet tubes and making providing service to your area difficult. As such, we are going to have to downgrade your monthly data cap to 2 gigabytes. If you want to maintain your current service level, you can subscribe to ComcastBIG for only an extra $50. Or, and we think you'll like this, for only $80 more than what you're currently paying you can get ComcastBIGandFast! It's our best value! With ComcastBIGandFast you get a 500gigabyte data cap and a super fast 6mbps connection. You'll feel accomplished!
$C: Thanks for the clarification!
$C: TIL Donald Trump was the Democratic candidate 
$C: remember Obamacare?
$C: Please clarify the effect?  Nothing has happened yet other than hyperbole.
$C: That’s not true. The net neutrality protections that just got repealed today were passed by Democrats in the first place. Democrats are virtually unanimous in supporting net neutrality. Hillary was a strong supporter of net neutrality. Both sides are not the same.
$C: They are extremely, extremely, extremely corrupt. It's very out in the open, and if people protest against it the police will sometimes beat them or kill them to regain control of the political situation. It's awful. 
$C: My bad. I meant against repealing net neutrality.
$C: Bernie Sanders is an idiot, Trump would have destroyed him.  Any Republican would have.  All they would have to do is ask about his tax policies which he can never explain.  That would be enough to sink him, but then the mud slinging would begin about things like stealing electricity from his neighbors and his rape fantasies, as well as his wife bankrupting a college while she and her daughter profited from it.

Not to mention how he wants to rob peoples retirement accounts and raise their taxes to give money to lazy people.  The majority of America is not socialist.

Edit:  I forgot to bring up his singlepayer healthcare plan.  He couldn't even explain why it failed in Vermont, or where the money would come from to pay for it for all Americans.  Democrats lost a lot of seats over getting the ACA passed and that was a major accomplishment.  Single payer is not passing anytime soon, and he would be hugely unpopular for proposing it.

Edit again:  That line of thought is completely flawed.  If Bernie "would have won" against Trump because he's so pure and Trump's so corrupt, then Bernie "would have won" against Clinton as well if she's supposedly so corrupt.   Barney Frank called him out in the early 90's for exactly that.  "His holier-than-thou attitude — saying in a very loud voice he is smarter than everyone else and purer than everyone else — really undercuts his effectiveness." 
$C: Either way the guy was unanimously approved by the US senate in 2012. 
$C: Probably.
$C: There is a serious argument to be had for net neutrality but it's lost in the hyperbole of people like OP. 
$C: ... I hope it's a parody.
$C: You think he's "dramatic" because he's chimping out over not being able to watch hentai? How dare you? That's a direct insult to his waifu and every other waifu out there. Sorry to break this to you but I will do EVERYTHING in my power to save my waifu from being taken from Trump. You can sit there and jerk off to your imagination while me and my waifu will have meaningful conversations since I was smart enough to download her before she got deleted forever. Sorry bro, looks like your waifu is gone forever now. You can still be a 3rd wheel when my waifu and I go on a date and live in regret of not following his guide.
$C: When did "less regulation" become "creeping regulation"? I've seen so much doublethink with Net Neutrality advocates it's unreal.

Net Neutrality is a regulation which put the Internet under Title II and in the hands of the FCC.

It is an incontestable fact that this repeal means *less* government interference, not more.
$C: I just see it as a contingency plan. 
$C: I just buy USBs to store my Blender projects, game mods, and weeb shit (anime art) on. Hope I don’t lose the USBs. 
$C: You don't want laws AGAINST net neutrality. Net neutrality is the thing that just got repealed.

How do you expect people to take you seriously when you don't understand the most basic thing about what you're preaching about?
$C: > If american ISPs decide to make free internet a thing for the rich 0,1%, it will affect everybody.

$C: People keep saying this. Did we not elect the people that put him there? 
$C: People are downvoting you because your comment goes agains the narritive, but you are 100% right. There werent any bullshit cable packages like this before 2015, and there wont be any now. What net neutrality really protected against was cable companes charging content providers for the bandwith they use. Netflix cant be charged more because they use more bandwith, even though they are the biggest bandwith hog on the net. 

Thats why there is such a strong push for net neutrality on reddit. Reddit knows that they will have to pay more because of their size, especially now that they are an image host too. They framed it as a law that was protecting the consumers, but it really was a law that protected the coorperations. 
$C: ...How many Floppy Disks would be needed to download the whole internet? Billions?
$C: ...No. More like everyone who said DJT wasn't going to be rounding up and deporting black people and putting muslims in concentration camps while being declared dictator-for-life.

Bad stuff is gonna happen and its gonna suck. Doesn't mean you need to go full on redneck-with-twenty-machine-guns-in-a-nuclear/illuminati/jewish-nwo/stonemason/communist/obamagernaturkurgunz-shelter.
$C: Said like someone who believes that the US is the center of the internet.

Yes, I know much of the internet is hosted in the US, that doesn't mean they can't move to other countries.
$C: It's a terrible day for the Internet, but this isn't remotely the worst it can get, and now the decision is passed the true lawsuits can begin, too.

What's REALLY probably gonna happen is most Americans are gonna be fleeced more cash to use certain services. But the threat is that I'm not sure if ISPs are covered by the First Amendment (government prohibited from silencing opinions they don't like basically) or whether they, as corporations, are allowed to censor whole websites they might not agree with. But I am sure that now the decision is made, there will be plenty of courts across the US clarifying the situation, and it may not go in the GOP's favour.
$C: Mhm and what about the 20 years before net neutrality? You do realize that its only been a thing since 2015 right?
$C: lol Comcast owns MSNBC. do you really think they will dump their own sites for Fox News. 
$C: Let that sink in.
$C: Yeah right now telcos in my country began offering "free Whatsapp". Coincidence? I think not.
$C: It might be impractical to live without an internet connection for some... But surely living without Netflix, Spotify, HBO, or other subscription internet based services is easy enough to do.
$C: Look up the "1965 immigration" and then look up "crime and iq by race"
$C: Because your internet gets throttled ours doesn't have to. Google will be as fast as always in Europe.
$C: I've seen this copy/paste over and over again. Stop.
$C: Then you're misinformed about what this movement is.

People are fighting so the extreme few ISPs in our country that charge way too much as is can't also hold a bias in controlling internet traffic. Look at, I believe either Portugal or the Philippines, which don't have NN laws and already pay for the internet content packages we're all afraid of.  Besides that, repealing NN would actively allow ISPs to throttle whatever sites they want, either if they don't pay up or if they don't like them.

You're completely right to be upset about the selling of our data, but this movement is not the place for that.
$C: But what is your actual point? Because, in your view, these issues were boiled down, and Reddit uses a marketing tool, we should....? What? Allow NN to be repealed?

I don't understand what your stance is. If you want Reddit to comment on that, then yeah that's great, but it's coming off like you're anti-NN because you don't like the phrasing
$C: I agree with all those things you listed being a part of net neutrality except for "data mining and marketing of metadata" and to a certain extent "privacy". 

I'm not saying those aren't issues and I do understand that "net neutrality" is bigger than the slogan, but what items included under that slogan have to deal with data mining, marketing of metadata and privacy? 

I'm honestly interested to know because it seems like I may have missed something.
$C: "Hypocritical" does not mean "your beliefs do not align completely with my own"


$C: They are posturing for net neutrality because its biggest impact was making it illegal to charge content providers more for the amount of bandwidth they use. 

The repeal of net neutrality affects Reddit’s profit margins far more than you and me. 
$C: It doesn't matter what you see NN as. That isn't what it is.
$C: And as that someone pointed out, you're on the wrong bandwagon. This is about not letting ISPs fuck the consumer, not about reddit doing something almost every major site on the internet does.

Seriously, you're upset that reddit's selling your data? Doesn't basically every search engine do that anyway for targeted advertising? (not that it works. I don't want to buy a boat, advertisers. Stop asking me >.>)
$C: You are an idiot 
$C: I believe most people instead see net neutrality as being about internet service providers being neutral towards content accessed.  Hence the name.
$C: Neither Reddit nor Sprinklr are ISP's, yet you boil their partnership down to a violation of net neutrality. By your own definition, you are the one committing an injustice here. 
$C: You literally just commented on one of my other posts with this nonsense:

>According to you, a useless drone that accepts semantical differences while ignoring equal principles. Net Neutrality is a principle - if Reddit can't follow it, it can't demand others to follow it either. GFY.

And another one from you to someone else

>Every downvote you receive is a salty reddit drone too weak to participate in an intellectual debate

Way to make yourself look stupid
$C: > NN is a much bigger issue than a single website engaging in the behavior that you are alleging.

does not mean

> What Reddit is doing is contrary to NN.

It means exactly what I wrote and nothing more.

I was not implying that Reddit's behavior is or is not a NN violation, whether they are actually being hypocrites or whether astroturfing is really going down. All of those issues are insignificant (true, untrue, correlated or uncorrelated) in the face of overall NN on the internet. Can we stop discussing them in NN threads, please.

I don't agree with you and I don't disagree with you. I am not educated about Sprinklr. I have absolutely no desire to become educated about it.

What I do care about, just like millions of other people, is NN.
$C: It starts way back but lets jump to the Verizon v. FCC ruling: if the FCC wanted to enforce Open-Internet Rules they need to re-classify ISPs under Title II as quasi-utilities strictly regulated as "common carriers", effectively a state-licensed monopoly. The most critical factor here is that under Title II, ISPs need to apply for Broadcasting Licenses, which give the government massive leverage over them.

Then take a look at  the Countering Information Warfare Act of 2016 (S.2692). 

> ...counter foreign propaganda and disinformation from our enemies by establishing an interagency center housed at the State Department..."

That's so bizarre, you think to yourself. Usually agencies are created independent from other branches of government, specifically to preserve accountability and dissuade corrupting influences. Why would you bother creating a new independent agency if you're literally going to house it in the White House?

>interagency center

Okay so it's a center, of multiple agencies. In the White House...

> p. 1399 - The head of the Center... shall be appointed by the President.

...that answers directly to the President? Okay? What exactly is it going to do?

>Maintain, collect, use, and disseminate records for research and data analysis of foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts

non-state propaganda? disinformation efforts? really?

>The Center will develop, integrate, and synchronize whole-of-government initiatives to expose and counter foreign disinformation operations...

How did Obama pass this through congress? He didn't... 
The file is titled National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017,
He waited until Christmas Eve and hid it inside of the 3,000 page annual military budget so nobody would notice it.

The President uses the "whole-of-government" to suppress information. Thanks to Net Neutrality's Title II, they can order all ISPs to take down "hostile" information and any websites that distribute it. If the ISP refuses, their Title II Broadcasting License is legally revoked, they can no longer do business, they go bankrupt, and the government buys out their infrastructure. The government can integrate into the ISPs to censor anything, anywhere, at anytime. The ISPs are forced to obey.

This is real... and on top of that 

>p.1446 - "The Center shall terminate on the date that is 8 years after the date of the enactment of this Act."

They thought she would win. 
 
---
BTW... not my research and wording for the most part. I paraphrased off someone else's post as I feel if i link the other post directly, it would be censored in a most neutral way for sure. correct anything you like. the more info the better.


---

TL;DR Reddit can complain that someone is spreading disinformation, or non-state propaganda (as decided by who?) and have you filed under abuse (ISP disconnects you), or have the community blocked at the ISP level. Yes, NN and other sneaky laws makes this possible, mainly in that for the ISP to maintain their license required under NN regulations, the government can more easily make them do a lot of things they wouldn't normally be allowed to even do legally.
$C: The fcc chairman responsible for this decision was appointed by obama?

$C: We just need more corruption, a tad bit more. The kind where people are put into internment camps. You'll have to huddle over a dim fire with newspapers as a blanket to keep warm. 
$C: Beep boop bop. Ya im a fcc paid bot. Also russian. 
$C: being called names by someone who just advocated for a specific assassination really hurts me deeply.

Agent Mathers. That's fucking hilarious. What about Scully and Mulder?
$C: Hint: It's not the greatest, and hasn't been for a long time. That's just a bit of propaganda that you fell for, and many Americans fall for.  It's one line among many to prevent critical self-reflection that might result in changes. 
$C: It is racist. He's a bad man and I completely agree with everything you said after the first sentence. You called a brown man a racist. It's not cool. Call him a piece of shit all you want and I'll applaud you. Just don't be racist.
$C: You are being incredibly racist, I bet you hate him because he is a minority

Disgusting 
$C: It's not a hero or Rambo situation, it's about actually being able to fight back.. yes, popular rebellions and uprisings with light arms can make a good stand against first world militaries.

Far from a fantasy, in both senses of the word.
$C: It gets worse, now ISP can legally charge tell European ISP that if they want to access US content they got to pay. Which in turn will inevitably make your internet bill go higher. I'm not saying they are going to do this, but they CAN.
$C: That's exactly how it works actually.

Lets say that Comcast has the fastest bandwidth connection to a group of servers that are hosting content you are trying to access. Now, without net neutrality, Comcast can tell the owners of those servers that it will refuse to give them any bandwidth at all unless the owner starts paying Comcast 3x more than they used to. Now everyone who is using that site is affected, because they will either be seeing slower speeds (owner can't afford that, is forced to use lower bandwidth connections through another ISP), or a worse experience as the owner tries to pass that cost onto the user.

Now, imagine what happens when all of the ISPs start doing this. 
$C: THE USER ABOVE IS A MOD AT r/nonetneutrality, and has spammed this message over 40 times pretending to be for net neutrality and violent, presumably because they lead an incredibly sad life, or are paid (redditor for 2 months, random subs, and a mod?). Report, and be aware that these people exist.
$C: It could be worse. You could be playing Destiny 2 AND paying for it!
$C: I was being sarcastic...

Personally, I would be okay with NN dying, as long as they helped create new ISPs, that could compete with the bigger ones.

But I also don't believe in not protesting, although redditors seem kind of too lazy/bitchy to do that.
$C: Guys...the FCC is live streaming it. Ajit is the only one left and it's 2-2....
$C: Oh I know, I was just explaining why there is no information available
$C: where can I find more about the social media package you're talking about?
$C: Has long as he's gone I don't care, corrupt piece of shit. If I believed in hell I would hope that's where he goes. He has sold out his fellow man for some cash.
$C: There was also other incidents of Tmobile blocking use of Google Wallet on their devices in favor of their own app that did the same thing.
$C: its tires spinning in the sand. There is a lot of action and a lot of noise, but no progress is made in any direction.
$C: and chat is back off. Dizzying

Edit: a word
$C: If I demand a premium service, I would expect to pay a premium fee. We have all been flying first class at coach pricing for a very long time.
$C: Yes, the vote to repeal net neutrality was passed.
$C: [deleted]
$C: [deleted]
$C: He was appointed to the commission by Obama. Confirmed unanimously by the senate in 2012. 
$C: It's all about money. 

We MIGHT pay more, in the future, as the context providers are going to be charged more to use more data. 

I don't like that this was passed, but it's not as big of a problem as everyone makes it out to be. 
$C: We're talking about Net Neutrality not net neutrality.
$C: You’re a pussy dude. 
$C: A bunch of brainwashed fools...
$C: Violence or tens of millions of dollars to make them listen. Maybe if the ruling class has a healthy fear of the everyman's retribution, they'll be more cooperative.
$C: Mueller is completely and totally unrelated from this.

The situations between assassinations are incredibly different, I don't think it's easy to compare one situation with another.
$C: I'm not a government official. Ajit Pai deserves death
$C: We sentence people to death for their influence on a single person's life; that's an accepted policy the society of 31 states. Restricting access to a human right for millions of people is a greater cost to social utility than a single murder. That wouldn't be going down a new path, it'd be following an already established path for a greater crime.

I don't support the death penalty in any case, so I'm not going to be calling for his life. However, if you do support the death penalty and believe that this bill is a greater cost to society than an arbitrary murder, then it's reasonable to apply it here. Although, it'd first have to be a crime to place so little value on social good.
$C: yes, please.
$C: My information is not wrong. He was in the FCC before Trump came in. You somehow think that people didn't know his stance before Trump became president?

You can blame Trump for making him chairman but he was already seated in the FCC well before 2016. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Because it's irrelevant. Obama had to appoint two Republicans because only three of the five can be from one party. Ajit Pai was Mitch McConnel’s choice. Same reason Trump kept two Democrats (pro-net neutrality) in the FCC. It's just that now they are outnumbered.
$C: Soy vey better get your soy down you billy wouldn't want the male hormones to come back
$C: I’m not American, I just don’t think calling for violence is a good idea. The answer is to become involved in politics and vote.
$C: IIRC, all of the FCC chairmen had received donations from telecom companies.
$C: Weird, because the rules were originally put in place by Dems. And Dems consistently voted in favor of NN in the House, Senate, and within the FCC.
$C: Yes, literally both democrats on the FCC commission are voting to preserve Net Neutrality.

Just like every democrat on the comission voted to implement Title II rules in 2015 to protect Net Neutrality. (Back when it was majority Democrat under a Democratic president)
$C: https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6pc5qu/democrats_propose_rules_to_break_up_broadband/dkon8t4/

Its totally a bi-partisan issue. Yeah, totally.
$C: The democrats instated title two, the republicans just abolished it. Grow up. Save your bs for your echo chamber.
$C: this: https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7jsyqt/the_fccs_vote_was_predictably_frustrating_but/dr8zyig/
$C: The ISPs must have been too stupid to buy Democrats, since Title II passed under Obama and a Democrat majority FCC Comission! And the 2010 Net Neutrality rules before that too!

They forgot to buy the Democrats in congress too!

Man, if only we could extrapolate all this voting data where Republicans continually vote to fuck us and Net Neutrality, and Democrats vote to protect us. But no, it can't be a partisan issue at all, impossible.
$C: Are you saying the money was just a gift or something in good faith?
$C: I don't really believe that a $50 million dollar fine levied on Comcast would inevitably be passed to consumers - before the FCC did away with Title II they had the authority to demand that ISPs be extremely transparent with regard to fees. If Comcast decided to charge a "FCC fee" to offset the fine by charging the consumer they would make enemies of most Americans overnight and be in the midst of one of their worst PR nightmares ever.

I'm still not seeing any convincing argument that the FCC is preventing competition from smaller ISPs. What regulatory burden is stopping cities from starting their own ISPs right now besides anti-municipal broadband laws passing at the state level (which is almost exclusively Republicans in red states btw)? The FCC doesn't have any power to regulate municipalities, they didn't even have enough gusto to regulate last mile access to the local loop to give Google Fiber access in places like Nashville. The idea that the FCC is some government agency capable of strong-arming small ISPs doesn't really ring true.

I guess I'm just not seeing how an ISP that has already been caught red-handed throttling their competitor's service (Comcast, Verizon, etc) is somehow less motivated to throttle the shit out of everything and raise their fees for everything when LESS regulation is on the books when they still maintain the same market ubiquity. 
$C: It doesn't matter how much money they donate to Democrats.  Democrats have shown time and time again that they will stand by their principles. Democrats are the *ONLY* ones who want to repeal the Citizens United decision, which means less corporate money. Democrats are the ones who decided to protect the internet and gave us net neutrality to begin with.

If you want a party that is more friendly to dirty money, you go to the Republicans. They're the ones who think corporations are people like you and me.

https://sunlightfoundation.com/2014/10/28/dark-money-still-a-republican-game/

$C: (*suddenly fearing I may be a regulation loving progressive*) Can you explain a bit about why deregulation is necessary for a government to survive?

I have heard that it was earlier regulation itself that put the ISPs in a position to throttle and thus require NN rules in the first place. 

Does your statements mean that less regulations = less levers for corporate interests to pull?

Do you mean that regulations need to change with the times, out with the old, in with the new?


$C: We need more people who think like you on here.  This is the most on-point comment on the subject I've seen on reddit yet.
$C: So then the internet will thrive then.
$C: I would have been afraid for my life if Hillary Clinton was voted in.  All the lies and manipulation.

It has nothing to do with republican or democrat.  You guys are fucking idiots if you believe that.  It has everything to do with greedy corporations and the government having their hands in too much shit.  Educate yourselves, don't be cucks
$C: Dude, making fun of someone the second they change their minds...  You're not gonna win friends or a free internet that way. 
$C: And it's your condescending attitude that makes people vote that way.  I've served my country, never been in trouble, pay my taxes etc...  But many of you come out of college courtesy of mommy and daddy and expect the world to change according to what you want.

 
$C: You're right, Democrats do have problems. However the Republicans are problems. It is like a shotgun to the gut and a deep cut on your shoulder, one needs some help but the other is starting to kill you.
$C: Lets start with the R's. It's a bigger target to hit. 
$C: You know you can't run for office without being a rich cunt.
$C: You won't get the backing ($$$) of the Democratic party. The only way that would have any chance at working is if you're a billionaire that can finance your own campaign.
$C: They litterally won't fund pro gun candidates. It's the same with pro-life candidates. they'd probably win a lot of red seats if they did.
$C: Any new gun control is only going to affect the law abiding people.  The illegal guns are still going to pour in here. 
$C: You sound like someone who's never lived in an AWB state
$C: AWB's, mag limits, revocation for non violent crimes (or really at all, once you've served your time, you should have your rights restored), and ERPO's. Background checks and such I can live with.
$C: >It's my right as an American to kill my countrymen for "disrespecting the flag" or whatever Fox News is telling me to be angry about. 

But that's illegal. So you are wrong.
$C: I've seen this exact comment before. 🤔🤔
$C: That's a good question, why should it be hard for a private citizen to acquire a deadly weapon?
$C: Seems like all the shooters are deranged leftists these days. Felons overwhelmingly vote Democrat as well. Maybe just ban all liberals from owning weapons? Probably cut all firearm related deaths by 75%. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Don't worry, you won't pay any taxes when Republicans eventually get around to ruining your livelihood like they've done with so many others.
$C: Hey remember when Democrats passed that tax bill a couple of days ago that’s going to make taxes for the middle and lower class skyrocket? Oh wait...that was the GOP.
$C: I prefer the Republican solution which is to drop taxes and make the deficit (which republicans complained about during all of Obama's term) rise by $1 trillion+.
$C: If you're not voting Blue-ish already you've brought us here. How're you liking it so far?
$C: Fuck Jerry Brown
$C: Hahahah!  Such hatred.  Why are you people always so bitter?  It's pathetic.  You riot and burn cars in the street every time you lose an election.  Nobody wants people like that in power.
$C: “You don’t vote for democrats so you must hate America” is what you’re saying basically, sounds pretty fanatical bud. 
$C: About as intelligent as I could expect from a Democrat, have a nice day! 
$C: The good news is you'll soon be too poor to able to insult republicans on the internet.

$C: Only difference is that Republicans stand on the side of ISPs while Democrats stand on the side of Tech Giants. It's just a giant battle between corporations. Neither side gives a shit about you.

$C: As seen in Alabama: not fucking kids, also a partisan issue. 
$C: Good job voting for drone strikes on innocent civilians.

Go back to r/politics, shill. 
$C: >Also, Reddit never was a free speech platform.

They did claim to be at first though and everyone knows it. Then they came to know the taste of $$$ and became globalist fuckwad censor monkies.

The "SJWs" may convince themselves it's cool and badass since it's only le evil bigots getting censored (mostly), but they're foolish to think that any censorship used against "nazis" can't be used against the far left some day as well.
$C: Sure, if you can outbid the current isps and provide "donations" to the right local representatives. 
$C: Implying I watch and care about Boomer TV. Good one lol 
$C: Less regulations equals more jobs so fat neck beard snowflakes like you can get one. 
$C: I don’t come to reddit to argue. I come to reddit to learn and to help others learn.
$C: I didn't vote in this election, I was under 18 at the time.
Blame whoever you'd like for this decision, but equating being a republican with liking the vote is untrue and unfair.
$C: SSSHHHH YOU"RE MAKING SENSE

$C: Comcast was caught blocking bittorrent traffic before the regulation was put in place, before NN regulations treating all traffic as fair and equal was already assumed the standard. It was only when companies began abusing it that they realised it needed to be regulated.

TL;DR: Verizon was actively coming up with plans to do such a thing before Title 2 changes stopped them in 2014.

That's the bad thing about the repeal of NN, though. Some people CAN'T be diligent consumers because they literally only have one choice. 
$C: To me, that argument is only for politics in general, not specific issues. 

Both sides are corrupted as fuck, how they vote is irrelevant from that pov imo. 
$C: You seem to think that everyone is going to have the exact same views as you and the Democrat party on all of these various topics. That's not the case. I know that a large majority of Reddit is Pro-Democrat that borders on being an echo-chamber, but when you start splitting hairs and getting into all of the individual issues in that list there are going to be divides.

I'll go ahead and set myself on the grill and list some areas that I believe in where the Democrats voted against my wishes. 

1. I am against endlessly raising the Debt ceiling. 

2. I am against continually raising the funding for Food Stamp programs. 

3. I see nothing wrong with Indefinite Military Detention Provisions. 

4. I didn't want Guantanamo closed. 

5. I'm very sharply against the over-reach that Democrats typically represent when it comes to matters of Environmental regulation and Energy Regulation.

Yes, I am only one person. But it's downright silly to imagine that everyone shares your sentiment on all of these issues.

(You also might want to remove the 2008 FISA Re-Authorization act from the list. The Dems are cut pretty close to the middle on that vote with 105 for it and 128 against it. This doesn't further the idea you are presenting that the parties are opposite, it merely presents the idea that the party is split within itself.)
$C: They are Pro Restoring Internet Freedom Act, which is the name of the policy that repeals NN
$C: Thanks, I'll be watching and waiting.

$C: K!
$C: I mean it doesn't take effect for a while, so there is some slim chance we can fight this still. There was an organization setting up appeals. I forget the name off the top of my head. 
$C: The FCC voted 3-2 in favor of returning the internet to Title I Classification. So yes, as of now, the repeal is going into effect. 

However, I would expect legal action to be brought forward in the coming months on financial grounds and based on the severe lack of accountability that was present in this entire process. This is likely to be drawn out, so it is in no way finished!
$C: To put it simply, the ruling in the FEC vs. Citizens United supreme court case made it possible for corporations and unions to spend as much as they want to get their candidate elected.  Right now the opinion of the court is that corporations are people and therefore have the first amendment right to support candidates.  The incredible wealth of some of these mega corporations makes their influence arguably more powerful than the citizens.  
$C: That’s a valid point too. But feeling letdown isn’t a good excuse to avoid participating in the democratic process. This is the result of **years** of doing this. 
$C: You should have went for the higher quality Russian bots like us instead of those cheap Chinese knock offs. 
$C: What? It means they can slow down (or even block) specific sites to force you or the site owners to pay more. That is a huge negative right there.

For example, if Comcast has their own streaming video service that competes with Netflix, they can make Netflix unusably slow while pumping up the speed on their own service. Or, they can say that you won't be able to use Netflix unless you pay extra, but the Comcast streaming service is free.  Previously, this behavior was not allowed.
$C: Throttling in this sense means deliberately capping or reducing speeds to a site or service. Comcast already did this with peer-to-peer filesharing services once before, until the FCC said "nah, bitch" and made them stop. 
$C: You called him a poo in the loo shitskin and then edited your comment. Absolutely disgusting language.
$C: I don't support that, but how is it unconstitutional?
$C: > I am also aware of how competition makes things better. 

Admirable, but naive. Something like 99% of American internet access is controlled by like 4 companies.

Without regulation you don't magically get more competition. You get just exploited by megacorporation monopolies that could care less about you, in the name of endless profit.

>And I am also aware of the fact that the FCC has been deciding what we can or can not see since it was first created

Not true. What are you talking about? Net neutrality prevents ISPs from doing just that.
$C: and how did the repealed net neutrality bill stop that from happening? big hint, it didnt
$C: Sure, as long as you like that the companies can screw you as much they want. Your only option being not using internet at all.

This has zero positives for you as internet user
$C: Lol either this is satire or you are brain damaged.
$C: Oh sweetheart... I don’t think you understand what literally means.
$C: >They literally rallied and killed someone

They "literally rallied and killed someone"? Source?

And so help me if you say Charlottesville.
$C: lol citation needed
$C: Where the hell did you hear this lmfao
$C: Good thing people aren't doxing and threatening to kill Ajit Pai, that would be hypocritical.
$C: They have several posts on supporting the repeal of Net Neutrality with 90%+ upvoted. Of course I am sure that not 100% of them support it but it seems pretty pathetic that any of them do let alone that quantity.
$C: They aren't even split, they just understand that Title II regulation was not really net neutrality, it was just branded as that. Anyone that actually read the text could easily understand that.
$C: Thank you. Someone understands. T_D doesnt demand ideological purity like you liberals do. There are a lot of disagreements, this topic being one of them. We are accepting of each other's differences in opinion and still MAGA together. While you liberals will shame and brigade anyone engaging in "wrong think". 
$C: Well, it is kind of hard to see opposing arguments when the only people that seem to disagree with it that I have seen are trump supporters and to get to their actual arguments you have to go through their subreddit which isn't exactly pleasant.

And assuming you do agree with the repeal of Net Neutrality feel free to tell me one or more valid reasons why it is good because the only person to give me an answer didn't really defend it, they just said that these regulations can be put back in.

If the core argument for it is that it can be reverted in some way then I am not really sure how anyone can agree with it. I am not saying I know all the facts but in my post I am literally requesting arguments for it because as much as people may be fighting against Net Neutrality without knowing much or any information I am sure the same applies to those who want Net Neutrality to be repealed.
$C: My comment wasn't exactly phrased well but I was just surprised to find out that of course, Trump supporters also want to repeal Net Neutrality and while I have no proof of this I am sure the vast majority want this just because Trump is in favor of it. It isn't like this doesn't happen the other way round but it is just so consistent with diehard Trump supporters.

/r/The_Donald's opinion on things just kinda reminds me of this [comic](http://extrafabulouscomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sports.png)

$C: >there is absolutely zero reason that this cannot be put in place after this action has happened.

Perhaps, which is why the fight for this goes on. The point is that this repeal gives ISP's the ability to do the things that everyone has already said already such as throttle certain content. But you are telling me it is okay because regulations can still be put  back into place. The regulations were already there, now it is being removed and your argument for it is that it can be added back?

It is ridiculous this repeal occurs in the first place and of course people are gonna fight for the things it just took away to be added back.
$C: Not really, that is a misconception. While the current system we had in place was done in 2015 the FCC began to enforce it in some aspects in 2008. And before that, not everything worked fine. There was a case of them limiting BitTorrent uploads and if it wasn't stopped I have no doubt this would have become common practice by ISP's if it wasn't stopped. Even if that wasn't the case, are you really going to say that because it wasn't occurring before (which it was) that means it should be alright to do so?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States
$C: Yeah, I am sure because you are on the opposite side of an almost universally agreed concept that Net Neutrality is good you must have investigated all of this and it isn't just because you're a supporter of Trump who appointed Ajit Pai.

So, want to tell me one legitimate reason you believed in repealing Net Neutrality that can't be met with a simple counter argument along with many reasons why keeping Net Neutrality is a good idea.

Oh and just to give you a tip: Claiming that because ISP's haven't abused this in the past prior to 2015 is

1. Not an argument to give them the power

2. Incorrect. 

Feel free to read up about it like me

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States
$C: You're not responding to someone who's saying they have zero controversial opinions, so that's not even a remotely valid retort question.  If all, or even most of your opinions are controversial, chances are very good that you're an asshole.  The fact that you responded with that question doesn't help to assuage that idea.
$C: Does reddit still support the pedo subs?
$C: > It's not about the expected outcome.

Its not even an expected outcome. It simply is *the* outcome. The three republican nominees have already stated that they are not in support of net neutrality. Its gone.
$C: So it being 2-2 and Pai being the last one left is apparently still up in the air for you? 
$C: You white hick.
$C: Yeh ISPs will censor content because they are loser cucks like /u/spez running a failing company that makes -$ yearly and needs donations from political groups to censor their users to stay alive


makes so much sense guis
$C: [**Several civil rights groups, such as the National Urban League, Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH, and League of United Latin American Citizens, oppose Title II net neutrality regulations**, who said that the call to regulate broadband Internet service as a utility would harm minority communities by stifling investment in underserved areas.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality)
$C: None of these companies openly suppress one side of the political spectrum online, so that's fine with me.
$C: "politicians are evil"

"Oh, but hey they support my view points, this politician must not be evil"

I'm not even talking about the rest of the argument, but that premise was ridiculous. 
$C: Why do their own research when they can go with the official narrative handed to them by their cringey leaders in social media?
$C: I've been saying in the small subs that there's a curious absence of discussion here, just screaming about a doomsday scenario that seems implausible.


But I wasn't brave enough to do it on the defaults.  In our truly cyberpunk future, the robots would have gunned you down.
$C: "Corporations are evil"

and it doesn't matter that now we have 198 corporations censoring the internet instead of 197.
$C: T_D T_D T_D HEY THIS GUY IS A T_D! He's with le drumpf! 
$C: It's ignorant to ignore arguments you don't agree with, how are you meant to convince them otherwise? and on the off chance you are incorrect, how are you meant to further inform yourself to become a more rounded human being?

$C: That's not what Net Neutrality means. 
$C: It's in a thread about Net Neutrality. You say Spez cares about Neutrality, and then mislead the audience to think it means "You can't be intolerant of intolerance if you're pro-Net Neutrality."

That's not true. And it's not what Net Neutrality means.

$C: If you have more than two ISP’s in your area, you’re very fortunate. I think many people have two, if not a single choice when it comes to internet providers. 

You may be able to choose someone else but a significant number of Americans can’t. 
$C: We should all focus on breaking up monopolies.  That is the crux of the problem.
$C: Everyone right now has doomsday goggles on, and will tell you that the internet will change, and that's true. However, I don't think the internet will change in such a drastic short term effect that everyone here has been falsely claiming. 

Here's how I think it will go down. ISPs will refrain from any real change for about 4 years. They may change little things here and there, but nothing drastic. 

The reason being, is they want to cement it to the courts that the only reason to force net neutrality right now is if it's ordered by a court. 

Courts don't care about what the people currently want. They'll look at why the request has been brought to the court, and the context within a legal standing. They'll look at legal precedents. They'll question why Net Neutrality should be law, based on past examples. 

Right now, if the cable companies started changing the internet, it would give the prosecution a legal standing that Net Neutrality rules were repealed, and within a year internet costs skyrocketed. So I don't think they'll change costs or access much very quickly. Without much evidence of why they NEED to implement laws, they'll lose that case.

However, if they wait and slowly introduce these measures, they can walk into the courthouse  and say there has been no negative effect to the internet. You can't just change what has been working for (at this point) 4 years of no Net Neutrality laws, just because a new administration comes in. 

The court will likely agree with the defense on this, as courts base everything they judge with past cases in mind. If you can't show a spike in usage, or a clear undeniable threat, you're likely to lose. Once you lose, the court will point to that loss in any future cases as reason why you should lose the next case as well. 

I don't think we'll see much change until 2021, but once that new/renewed administration is official, we'll begin seeing the internet sectioned off into tiers. Much the way a cable plan is. 

The current cable TV platform is dying. Less americans are watching TV then ever, and the cable industry is looking for their next honeypot to put their paws in. 

They also supply the internet in many cases, which is what people are switching to. 

So instead of charging a buttload for TV, they'll just charge a buttload for internet. You'll have your basic internet. You get some websites. Then you'll have to pay more for video services, or online gaming, or social media. Each one of those will be an additional charge with no additional benefit to how your bill is set up today. 

You may think "Alright, so I personally have a choice between two ISPs I can go with....I'll just do switch if my ISP does that". 

Well, the problem is, most ISPs will be doing this. They know they have a monopoly in most markets, so they'll just do this in every market, and so will their competition. 

Every major company to support this repeal was an ISP, and every major opponent for this repeal was an internet based company that doesn't make their money off their users, but rather from the amount of users they have. Things like facebook, and twitter. That should tell you all you need to know about how this will affect userbases, and  number of people who will continue to go online/get to go online. 

The other main issue is that the ISPs just became the rulers and judges of the internet. One of the things that this repeal does, is it makes the FCC no longer in charge of the internet. They repealed their own right to authorize what's legal to do with providing internet. As such, let's say there's a blog out there that catches peoples eye, because it criticizes comcast. Well, if you're a comcast subscriber, that blog doesn't exist. 

You have no recourse either. There is no authority of the internet anymore. The person you need to complain to, to regulate this, is comcast.....and they're the one pulling your access from the blog in the first place. 

Remember when I said in 2007 the ISPs sued the FCC for the right to disregard net neutrality because it wasn't law? Well, I remember it was roughly around 2010 that Verizon blocked access to skype so you would have to use it's partnered product that costs money, as opposed to skype which did the same thing, but for free. They blocked the skype service on verizon for about a year. That concept could become the new standard in about 4 years. 
$C: Hahaha ok buddy.

Just like it was before 2015 right? OH WAIT
$C: Are you sure you're Aussie?

Your accent sounds Russian lol
$C: which big company?
$C: At least you're aware of what's happening.
$C: So much for civility. If you agree with us on a certain issue you don’t have to tell us to fuck right off, just some advice if you don’t want to be a pretentious ass.
$C: it's 5 votes total. 

right now the FCC is headed by 3 Republicans (less restraint over the people, states, and private companies rights), and 2 Democrats (more restraint over individual, states, and corporate rights) 


the republicans are going to vote to repeal it, because they will have the majority vote...

this is the problem with a 2 party system... this is what Washington warned us about...

$C: You poor, poor soul.
$C: pay credit where credit due. 

That being said... I can't help but imagine that fighting the forces of evil with their own methods is A.) possible (since they've had so much more practice and B.) exactly what our comrades in Moscow want
$C: Except for the vast differences between who owns and operates the bottom layers and the top layers, but sure...
$C: Layer 7 is just the application layer.  Layers 5-7 would be the layers in the OSI model relating to edge providers.  But the OSI model was not designed for, and should not be used in, a regulatory framework concerning providers.

The framing model for regulation specifies “edge” providers and “service” providers.  The small number of service provides coupled with their ability to control every bit of traffic means that they require stronger regulation.  Regulation that prevents service providers from discriminating against edge providers allows for you, the consumer, to choose which edge provider you connect to.

Service provider regulation means edge provider freedom.
$C: When you try to sound smart and just say words you learn in your freshman Networking class.
$C: > If the FCC regulates the wires they can regulate what is said over the wires.

Sure, they *could* in theory.

$C: Yea why use it again? Why so racist?
$C: Up until today, internet service providers (ISPs) could not give priority to certain websites or discriminate against other websites. If you pay for internet, you can go to any corner of the internet. Now it's more like pay $30 a month and you can go to news sites. Pay $30 a month and you can go to social media sites. Pay $30 a month and you can access Steam to play video games. All these charges can stack up instead of just paying $50 a month for everything.
$C: Wow thank you so much for the information 
$C: it did on twitter and than I went to youtube's stream and saw it still running.
$C: Right, it wasn't protected until then, but it still existed. Net neutrality was in effect since the creation of the internet.

You're right that the things NN is supposed to protect never happened pre 2014, but that doesn't prove having to pay for websites won't happen moving forward. That is a possibility now thanks to NN getting repealed. 2015 was just the preemptive measure to avoid that.
$C: > The vote was 2-1 to remove the FCC's authority to enforce open internet.

No, it wasn't.

The 2-1 ruling was that the FCC never had that authority to begin with, but rather just kinda **decided** that it should.

When a leftlet is backed into a corner and obviously on the wrong side they begin to start ranting about random topics like penis size because really all they can do is insult people. They don't have any real logic or science behind their beliefs.

I guess it just doesn't sound as bad to most people here when the comments are instead talking about hunting down Republicans.
$C: If reddit were truly supportive of a neutral internet they would present both sides of the argument equally.
$C: Propaganda, like how all pages have a pro-NN logo to create the organic support, how the site spams you with a pro-NN popup.  Yeah thats not propaganda.
$C: No, like how Comcast says "it's very important that we're allowed to fuck you in the ass. We would never do it. But let us. Because we won't. But we should be able to. Trust us." 
$C: Lol that was *totally* organic.

$C: True, some of you work for ISP's I am sure.
$C: > Access to the internet isn't a right. 

Is that the argument?  You want the internet only for those who can afford it?  I'm just curious if there is any other argument, or that is it?


$C: Genuine question: So if an ISP begins censoring content/news/whatever, and there aren't other competing options (lots of places only have 1 company to pick from), you're just screwed?
$C: The funny thing is none of this is even about the consumers. It is all about corporations versus other corporations. ISP's know they can't charge consumers money. But if they threaten to slow the speeds of netflix unless netflix pays them some absurd amount of money, nobody will do anything.

$C: Person who wants net to be neutral is calling for an entire subreddit to be censored. See anything hypocritical about that? The brainwashing is strong. 
$C: Come next election, I'm going to send you photographic proof of my vote for Trump. You're so brave, calling for Trump supporters to be hunted and "brought to justice" for participating in the voting process.
$C: I am now convinced this is bait 
$C: The internet is going to be just fine. Did you know that ISP's can create tiered payment systems under title 2? They haven't. Did you know there is a decency clause in the title 2 regulations? That means they can censor content they don't like either. Literally everything you are afraid of, already exists.

$C: What is Verizon suddenly found themselves with a lot of fiber cuts that needed repair?
$C: Even less possible. In a country where nearly half the population was stupid enough to vote for donald, the chances of getting 66% of our states to actually call for a convention is pretty much nil. Even if that *does* happen, the odds of getting 75% of them to *pass* the amendment are even smaller. Amending the US Constitution in this manner has never happened.

The larger issue is the rapidly growing divide between the government and its people. With money being equal to free speech and lobbying in place as legalized bribery, our problems will not be solved at the ballot box.
$C: Wow, I guess you aren't as dedicated to The Revolution as I am. Pathetic.
$C: Thanks bro. (•ω•)
$C: I understand and agree that Reddit is looking out for their best interests and doing whatever they can to preserve their business model.

Although I disagree that Reddit’s “best interest” conflicts with my “best interest” in this case. However I strongly believe that Comcast/Verizon/Spectrum’s “best interest” conflicts with mine when it comes to Net Neutrality.
$C: Advocating mass murder of government employees because reddit told you to be butthurt is a felony.
$C: Replied to the wrong person, sorry on mobile.
$C: Ah, I misinterpreted your comment then. I do agree with you!
$C: > And each one of these were resolved by the market 

No they weren't. Net neutrality was introduced BECAUSE of censorship issues like those, moron. 

$C: I read exactly what you posted. What I posted debunks all of it.
$C: You already ban r/the_donald in every way possible except a full block - throttling all popularity measurements and blocking the content. 

The only reason it is not completely blocked, despite constant nagging from low level shills, is that the higher ups at Reddit fear legal and political action if the optics go bad enough. 
Right now they can claim it's not banned while achieving virtually equal results.

Besides - most T_D users support Net Neutrality in principle, they just oppose Title II designation and FCC oversight because they give too much power to the government without clear guidelines. Separation of Network Providers from ISPs can be done successfully (as in countries like Israel) if government regulation is clearly defined and limited, while registration of competitors is promoted. Title II did none of that so it was not Net Neutrality but another political scam. 
$C: Mainstream media is fake news.

I get all my political facts from 4chan, the youtube comments and 9gag memes

>I am hearing rumors that black voters from MS were encouraged to cross over into AL and vote. Anyone else hearing this? Anything to it? That might explain the 30% turnout higher than population percentage. Just reporting the rumor. 

The complete browbeating was summarized as:
>13/ 20,000-40,000 fake voters, all recruited secretly, paid somehow, transported in hundreds of buses with hundreds of drivers, no witnesses, no leaks, no paper trail, voting in dozens of stations, no witnesses, with 10k forged ID's.

.
$C: > it's called "dropping red pills" which basically means you are tasked with making a conspiracy claim by posting a comment, a video by joe schmoe or a conspiracy article written on a word press blog and not really providing credible evidence beyond that

Wait, so they are actually the ones shilling?  I have a headache.
$C: So, this sounds the same as the anti-vac movement's SOP
$C: Or he sold r politics for 2.8 million dollars. Jeeze I wonder which is more likely.
$C: >"Fuck i hate Spez so much, i better pay money to Spez because someone disagreed with him"
$C: People guild shitty comments to keep them up despite the downvotes.  For some reason about 60 people gilded one of EA's comments (despite the fact one would have accomplished the same thing).  
$C: So you see some new mods added 2 years ago and you instantly assume "haha, that's because it was sold by Spez for $2.8 million".

why would you even post this dumb shit if you're not even sure of it yourself? holy god damn christ 
$C: I can go into 4chan and make a post saying you have a micropenis, would that make it true just because it's there?
$C: Ahhh, the cornerstone of factual reporting.

An anonymous thread where some dude said he was an employee at x so it must be true.

With that said, you seem to be the only person in this comment chain to actually respond with an attempt to give evidence.
$C: so another pizzagate...? Why does anyone believe these republican conspiracy theories?
$C: The same 4chon that claimed the source of the Dossier was themselves?

Hahahaha.

*jenniferlawrenceokay.gif*
$C: I love how you get downvotes for sharing the “source” everyone is asking for. Like god damn you people are so fucking stupid sometimes.
$C: That's not what he said at all... Try learning to read before you vote.
$C: Also you're being an idiot framing a question about an inconsistency in someone's viewpoint as saying they're not allowed to have one.


$C: "you used your political voice to do this, why are you pretending this isn't what you wanted?"
$C: Aren't you just taking my comment and writing what you want to see? Pretty sure I didn't tell him that his opinion is invalid.
$C: So tell us, oh wise one, what is valid or even factual about his "opinion".
$C: "You post in a sub where brigading, spreading lies and trolling is encouraged, your opinion is invalid"

Fixed
$C: Why are you double quoting something that wasn't actually said.

Didn't know posting wild and baseless conspiracy theories was an opinion though.. "🤔"
$C: Clearly building a wall, making sure people don't use the wrong restrooms, and coal jobs are much more important considerations than fair wages, equal rights, the environment, education and net neutrality. 
$C: Let's get one thing straight. There's propaganda coming from either side. So please, enough with the team mentality bs. It's what is keeping us divided. 

To elaborate, the warranted criticism of the left that get ignored by the centrist and neoliberals, is being used by our enemies to divide. If moderate dems accepted their faults and worked on them instead of attacking those (even on the left - mainly progressives or what corporate dems call far left) who are rightfully criticizing them, then we would not be divided and there would be nothing for our enemies to use against us.  

They would have you believe that criticism even from the left must be done by a Trump or Russian apologist or far left crazy. That's how serious they take the criticism. They take it as an attack then demand that if you are not on their team (blindly following) then you must be on their enemies team. 

Edit: We don't need a kid from 4chan or t_d to make a claim in order to see what is blatantly obvious.
$C: Could you link us some proof or strong indication of this being true?
$C: Proof? 
$C: Evidence?
$C: >wrong think

That isn't a thing. 
$C: I can't wait to see the proof on this one. 
$C: Proof?
$C: Where is the proof on this that isn't from James O'Keefe or infowars? I might believe you if you can provide evidence.
$C: I know this is probably a silly question, but do you have links, sources, or proof??
$C: Says the Ruskie Bot bro

That's all bullshit
$C: How in the world did you arrive to that conclusion? 
$C: You're a fucking idiot if you believe that lol
$C: Source?
$C: So do you have any evidence?
$C: I also like the waiting 10 minutes to reply... because when you're having a conversation about opposing viewpoints, there's nothing better than making you wait because you're not representing the "right one". I could understand doing that if you troll constantly or whatever, but yeah... ridiculous sub.
$C: I haven't seen a penny.
$C: Net Nuetrality is the cover for all the fuckery that is Reddit and Social Media in general.
$C: They ban any and all dissent. If you go against their narrative they ban you for "trolling".
$C: That would certainly explain why the mods there seem complicit with the pro-establishment narrative that is being pushed there. Anything criticizing the DNC or Hillary (even if it comes from people on the left) is downvoted into oblivion. That and we're called delusional and conspiracy theorist for believing the sub is compromised, be it mods and or bots and shills. Even if they are not complicit (I believe they are) they at least know there is a problem but won't do anything about it, let alone acknowledge it. 
$C: That explains a whole lot of my experiences with that sub. Any source for this? Not doing the "no source it didn't happen" that you hear all day long on r/politics, I just want to know where you get reliable information since I can't ever find any myself.
$C: I'm sure you guys will get even more hyped after you lose the house and Senate next year.
$C: Nah, you're all just as miserable, angry and defensive as ever. Everyone can see that 
$C: Yeah I know, thanks.  I like to sort by controversial and see what the opposite side is saying, almost always garbage.
$C: I wasn’t talking to you.  But I can’t imagine why someone’s Reddit life would revolve around that cesspool for free.

At least you ply video games between your time spent “triggering cucks” as you put it.
$C: Still waiting for my check too.
$C: I am a bit missinformed..... So... Sorry if i am mistaken..... But i have read that Donald Trump has gone bankrupt a few times....... Is it not true? EDIT: oh ok then can you fill me in on more details please? You said Trump the individual... Why?
$C: I mean if they wanted to buy just me out for a year I'll take $1 million. My offer's still on the table. To this day the left can't meme. I would have been a better investment.
$C: Why are you being downvoted for asking for proof?

There's a lot of talk here but no proof.
$C: Because there's no proof lol
$C: Their only proof is a 4chan thread.  That should tell you enough.
$C: Use your eyes? It is a hillary rally sub lol
$C: bro what about obamas fucking legacy over here man all le drumpfffff is doing is ruining our diversity hires legacy!! REEEEEEEee

$C: Wow. Imagine being that lonely.
$C: You threatened mass violence.  Expect a visit.
$C: oh really? The ISPs didn't hint that they would abuse this power before the vote? Color me surprised. And, do you think maybe in retrospect, people blew the whole "taking your guns" thing out of proportion... considering he had 8 years to do so and never attempted.
$C: >than ISPs have made in favor of taking the internet away or "stealing the internet".

Ah, so i bet they'd have put that legally and in writing if they're so sure that they'd never do that. Right?


What? You mean a company can lie to further their agenda and there's no repercussions? Huh.



$C: I bet 1000 pesos you don't.
$C: Eventually, sure, but it's a last resort. I wholeheartedly agree with the reasoning behind the 2nd Amendment and the amendment, itself, but now? All options have not been exhausted. We, as civilians, are not under a tyranny that has prevented us from carrying out due process or taken away our rights. You are calling for a violent and hostile takeover of our government because access to the internet may or may not be limited. Invoking the 2nd Amendment is outrageous to even consider at this moment because of this decision.
$C: I'm not a Republican. And I'll take those Reagan and Trump supporters on my side in a fight over anyone on the left. Hell, they'd shoot me for not checking my privilege.
$C: Isn't the left in favor of Islam?
$C: I don't support Clinton, tho
$C: I don't support either of those things and I'm pretty right. I think it's a shame Doug Jones won, but I'm happy Roy Moore lost.
$C: I'm sure you can
$C: The salt levels have been missed, stock up now because there won't be a vein like this until midterms!
$C: It might come as a shock to you but not everyone voted for the politicians that are in office today. 
$C: Still going strong.
$C: Oh, actively encouraging violence? The tolerant left strikes again
$C: Do you enjoy portraying yourself as a complete idiot or something? 
$C: Trump is your President.
$C: Who didn't? Man I rather not get into it....I bid you good day. Not going to bother.

PS: If you think we're fucked, you are also fucked. Because remember, companies like Google, Apple, Netflix are based in America.

But I'll leave it at that, good day to you.
$C: Meaning, being the child you are, you lack the ability to think ahead. Because something doesn't happen the very second an event occurs, doesn't mean there isn't a delayed effect. ISPs were already trying to implement fast laning and tiered service before the 2015 rule. Clearly those policies aren't going to take effect the day of the vote, or even in 60 days when the actual policy takes effect (which I assume you didn't know because, again, you are at the very least mentally the same as my 12 year old nephew). But to think they aren't going to continue implementing policies this rule was designed to stop is laughably fucking stupid.
$C: Your username. 
$C: Neato buddy, but don’t advocate killing those you don’t agree with. Do you not realize how easy you make it for those who oppose you to paint your side as evil when you’re calling for the deaths of people you oppose?

$C: Except Obama was the one who made him Chairman

Ironic, isn't it? You can't blame Trump this time, kiddo.
$C: The only problem is that the free market has proven time and again that it is prone to crashes and fluctuations. If you deregulate the internet you risk destabilising a tool that has become increasingly important and will only grow in importance over the coming decades. I think leaving the government in control is fine in this case, since it'll mitigate the risks to everything and everyone that's relying on the internet for various reasons. 
$C: "Net Neutrality" describes the regulation just as well as the "PATRIOT Act". Free and open internet as defined by the government, no thanks.
$C: So basically what you are saying is that the 'fast lanes' scenario is not going to happen - and if it does, then you were wrong? 
$C: Well if it's so obvious it should be easy to explain.

Explain it for me. 
$C: 30% of Americans only have access to 1 provider you dumb fuck. And everyone else has only 2 or 3 to choose from. This has fuck all to do with the free market and has everything to do with our rights of equal access to a resource that we the people paid for with our tax dollars. Don't give me that simple minded bullshit excuse.

I'm not you, so I can't really know that unless you provide examples. I'm sure you have a sob story about that one time Mark Zuckerberg and Spez went into your house, strapped you down on a bed, and started posting SJW posts on your facebook account. 

>the people who destroyed free expression on the internet are the ones telling us that net neutrality will save free speech

Starting your point off with "the people" without providing any examples isn't helping you.

>the internet WAS freer prior to the Obama administration. This is a FACT. This is REALITY.

IF I JUST TYPE IN CAPITAL LETTERS PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO BELIEVE ME EVEN THOUGH I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO BACK THIS UP

now here comes my favourite part of your comment, it's comedy gold. It's like a textbook example of people who are stuck in 2015, and think the SJW movement isn't anything but dead in the water. It's so good in fact, that I think this entire comment is probably just an edited version of some copypasta.

Also, it's funny how you've been portraying yourself as a bastion of free speech, yet when some idiots make a dumb music video that isn't even good you think it's an attack on the nation.

Yeah I watched the internet historian video too, it's fucking hilarious. Also, that guy got what he deserved, but guess what, there are always people in a protest who take things too far. However, I'm sure it's fine to use this guy as the icon of left-leaning people and put him on a straw, lift him up high and point at him while saying: "SEE GUYS, THEY'RE THE BAD GUYS"

This is a tragedy as much as a tragedy as any shooting. Again, however, you take the actions of one nutcase with a gun and use him as the strawman for every person against net neutrality. Let's also just point out that none of the videos you linked have anything to do with net neutrality.

>It's not non-existent monopolies doing this.

>non-existent monopolies

Motherfucker Disney just bought 21st Century Fox assets, are you high 

> A certain segment of the population has become violently against free speech, and they're also the ones demanding net neutrality. 

But it wouldn't be the people who think some dumb antifa video is as much of a threat in the nation as it is a mass shooting, right? I'm sure you're not living in a bubble, it's EVERYONE ELSE who's living in a bubble. 
$C: control=regulation

wew lad. I'm sure that charging people for murder is also insidious government control.
$C: I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not for censorship. I don't know subreddits of yours got banned, I'm not making a judgement on that. Just pointing out its not very relevant to the conversation.
$C: Have you ever heard of Tang?  It is this orange-ish flavored drink that was apparently a drink for NASA astronauts.  It was also heavily advertised in comic books in the 80s and 90s using the image of famous soccer player Pele.

See?  I too can spout irrelevant shit in a long worded post that in no way adresses the thing I am replying to.

$C: So if corporations are already censoring, might as well let ISPs have the ability to censor as well. I guess every corporation should have the same rights to censor everybody?
$C: KFC advertises themselves as "delicious" and I beg to differ with that description.  You can differ with any advertisement you like, and it still doesn't change the fact that no one has to serve you, host your talk, or do business with you if you don't want to.
$C: The Internet is a utility.  It's not the same thing as using Reddit, and unless you are purposefully squinting, it's very clear.
$C: And here come the Pretzels!
$C: Okay first off, even a quick Wikipedia search could have informed you that the FCC is an independent federal regulatory agency and in no way a part of the executive branch. Just because a President will sometimes have the opportunity to appoint a chairman, that does not mean that your view of the agency needs to be the same as one's view of the President. 
Lets apply your logic to a hypothetical and see where it goes wrong. Lets have a hypothetical conservative citizen in 2010, he disapproves of Obama for a multitude of reasons. Now lets take another governmental entity/position that is connected to the presidency on the basis of presidential appointment for the position. For example, take the Secretary of Defense which is even a stronger connection than the FCC considering the Department of Defense is actually in the executive branch of government. In this hypothetical situation the Secretary of Defense decides to disband/severely limit the power of the National Guard (kind of similar to the FCC ceding significant regulatory power). Now this hypothetical conservative voter happens to take national security quite seriously and supports the military and national guard. He loves the National Guard and does not want to see it weakened. 
In this situation, your first comment that i responded to would translate to "Conservatives: Waaaa Obama and the Government are the enemies! Booo!, Also Conservatives: No please Obama and Government don't give up some power, please no! Boo!" Now you see in this case that just because the Department of Defense is related to Obama, it is completely reasonable and rational for a voter to hate Obama while also advocating for a DIFFERENT aspect of the government to retain power or pursue certain policies. It is completely valid for this individual to value the DoD and dislike the President. If you were to take your second comment, it would translate like this: "Uhh DoD = Obama-controlled government organization" and therefore you have to feel the same about both. So when you switch "Trump" with "Obama" and the "FCC" with the "DoD", you can see how you can have a problem with your logic. If a voter can hate Obama and support the National Guard and its military capabilities, then another voter can hate Trump and support the FCC and its regulatory abilities.
The federal government is incredibly complex with its many branches, departments, and an alphabet soup of agencies. Just because they are technically subordinate to the President (among other positions) does not make them the President. These various entities perform so many different functions that its laughable to oversimplify them all by expecting individuals to view every aspect of the government in the same light they view who ever is living in the White House.


$C: So proclaiming you want someone killed is now allowed on Reddit?
$C: Hey, you're technically not wrong. I think, however, murdering the chairman of the FCC for changing the body that regulates ISPs from the FTC back to the FCC,  might be a bit extreme. I think America might be OK for a little while if internet regulations returned to pre 2015 rules. 
$C: 1 Bernie 2 also Bernie you are trying to say Bernie voters should vote for the witch that stole the election from their candidate and lost the entire election for the dems because she's a fucking democrat ?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!? if you wanted a democrat for the third election in a row  so badly ( which is pretty stupid  one party almost never holds the presidency for that long ) you should have picked Bernie or they should have but  the DNC is so stupid and braindead they actually think mainstream media Holywood and Hillary having a fucking Vagina would be enough to beat Trump? yeah not gonna happen the only ones you should be mad at for losing the election is the DNC Bernie also fucking endorsed her which was a really  stupid move on top of all of that 
$C: Your anger is severely misplaced. Bernie spoke to a great deal of people who wanted real change. Hillary was just another corporate democrat. I’ll gladly take this temporary pain in order to play the long game and systematically allow the Democrats to shift further left to adapt to that appeal that Bernie had.
$C: You're above a sub with 14 million more subscribers than TD and you don't find that odd? Without bots you're barely above incels before we got rid of those shit stains. Keep believing otherwise, not like you're not getting fucked by this repeal either.
$C: Maybe the boomers, but they sure as hell arent here.

$C: Ohh, I wasn't meaning to disregard your comment.  I see you are new to Reddit, Welcome to a great place to discuss and debate.  I don't see how allowing Internet Service to be throttled or blocked speeds it up? Which monopolies are being broken up?  Looks like the FCC just gave the newly classified ISD'd more power over what customers can view on the internet.  And gave ISD's the option to sell nonthrottled access to sites they decide.    
$C: Net neutrality is about letting your isps provide fast lanes to people who pay for it.
$C: I think you are having a seizure. 
$C: How are you a consumer?  Do you spend any money on Reddit?
$C: I'm not reading a crazy conspiracy site. It would be like reading an  infowars article about Sandy Hook. Just say your argument. You want Comcast to basically have zero regulation on how it handles Internet traffic. Seems like a weird stance. 
$C: Not really this is just a pretty jewish move on the American people
$C: Thankfully your views align perfectly with the corporate whispers in your ear that say "no one makes a fool out of you".
$C: It's not on /r/all because you guys are annoying as fuck and you people are literally the only ones that care about the stupid shit you talk about. 
$C: how is a free and open internet a socialist agenda? How is allowing the ISP's to prioritize data going to benefit the common person? This is one regulation that actually protected freedom. 
$C: I'm not even american and i'm pissed at your stupidity.
$C: When you hit your head, does it echo?
$C: "Hopefully I can pay more money to enjoy my hobbies"

-- you

Edit: also using 'thus' pretty much proves you're a "iamverysmart"
$C: ISP won't charge the customer, they charge the business. Meaning if you want to start your own reddit/netflix/whatever competitor you can't because no $$$
$C: You're fucking stupid. 
$C: You know that liberals, on average, are better educated and make higher earnings right?
$C: Sounds like someone doesn't know anything about the internet. 
$C: How can you be so thick?  This is some weapons grade military applied level of stupid.
$C: I think breaking up monopolies is a good thing. But how exactly does the ban of NN mean internet will be for better? Whats the point of a gigabyte download speeds if I cant even access Steam without a premium? 
$C: Tears? All I did was ask a simple closed-ended question. I didn't make position known, nor did I question yours. All I did was ask if you think something will be effected by this change. 
$C: Pai was nowhere on my ballot or anyone else’s. We didn’t vote for him.
$C: deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.1545  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/92650)
$C: Just like you're casually ignoring that you didn't vote for any of these people and you still tried to call them elected officials.  Good luck with life.
$C: Okay, you're wrong. NN means that ISPs must treat all data that passes through them equally.
$C: So now you want to assassinate anybody part of the 1% okay so you  hate the  rich   you want everybody to be equally poor besides the leader go live in North Korea and funny thing is Obama and Hillary and most politicians are part of the fucking 1% you communist 
$C: Do you really believe that major data providers dont have metered pricing?  You do realize that they dont just call Comcast and sign up for $49.99/mo internet to host their sites.

Even an individual getting a budget hosting plan n a local data center will have a bandwidth max with overage charges.  You probably ought to read up a bit before you go around saying stupid shit.

I have no opinion.on progressive taxes so your "argument" against me means nothing.

$C: True. It was stated in the FCC meeting. 
$C: Title 2 was government regulation on ISPs to ensure equal distribution of lanes(network speeds?) With the repeal slow and fast lanes will open for a price which means cheaper internet for consumers but potentially increased price for internet moguls who used that bandwidth under the governments protection without paying their share. 

The argument is new and innovative internet technologies are stifling ISP growth, speed and price reduction for their customers. I believe it to be true. So all in all you as a consumer will win but internet companies may lose. 
$C: That is how it works.  AT&T encouraged everyone with iPhones to switch from an unlimited plan to a limited plan by blocking FaceTime and tethering on the unlimited plan and allowing it on the limited plan.  This shit will happen even more now.
$C: It's interesting that you have to classify a person to either side, instead of believing that someone can have views from both. Also, you expressing your concerns about the "left" giving a shit about freedom of expression is priceless
$C: I'm assuming due to you being too young to have bills to pay
$C: [deleted]
$C: 1.  I was being facetious, sarcastic, going for the laugh.  

2.  Who doesn't like free phones?

Bonus 3.  That timeline has some solid links in it. Check them out please, or do your own digging into pre NN timelines.  The abuse was real.
$C: Funny that you're able to voice your conservative opinion when you're being 100% censored.
$C: I don’t think you understand what “being stripped of free speech” means. 
$C: None of what you just said made any appreciable amount of sense, but OK. 
$C: You're right, but blaming all left leaning persons and later calling all people who downvote you wannabe terrorists is where you are dead wrong. 


$C: This is my first post about this, I barely even post about politics because everyone on both sides is ridiculously extreme in their views, and I agree that most of it is fear mongering shit. But sometimes it isn't, and this is one of those situations. If you don't see it then you are dumbass. Do you honestly think that ISPs are not going to take you for every cent that they can? This just opened it up so they can do that, and they will do that. Maybe it won't happen for another year, maybe even 2, but in the future this will cause you to pay more for your internet service. They'll charge you a fee if you want to use their service to play video games, they'll charge you a fee if you want to visit sports websites, they'll charge you a fee if you want to visit social media sites. 

This is how businesses work. CEOs are expected to continually produce increasing revenues, and there are only so many new products and offerings that can be introduced. The only logical next step is increasing the subscription costs that are charged to consumers. They now will legally be able to charge you more for your subscription, and there isn't a CEO in the country that wouldn't take advantage of that. You are living in a fairy tale if you think this isn't going to negatively effect you at some point in the next 5 years
$C: Yes, do you not remember? Literally the dark ages of the internet 
$C: I see. You should have put a /s in that case.
$C: you know, I can understand Russian if that would be easier for you to write.
$C: Because the internet never has been so prevalent or abusable as it is nowadays. Do u really think companies aren't gonna tax us for access the second they have the chance? Also we had protections, NN was all those protections collected in one place and now with it's repeal the entire system is changed. Are u really so ignorant that ur buying into pai's speech about this being what the majority of America wants when we have the solid info to prove otherwise?
$C: I agree that it shouldn't be controlled by anyone. 

But this vote is giving the control to giant companies. So Comcast will control the internet. 

*Great.*
$C: None of your comments say anything about Net Neutrality and why it's good/bad. Just criticism of hivemind beliefs and that this is "fear mongering."  Where are your facts to support your argument?  Add something to the noise, otherwise no one is going to take your comments seriously.
$C: You've just proven that you don't know what you're talking about. Tell me what you *think* NN is and then we can move on from there.
$C: No. No you won’t be because No ones going to waste much time on this other than calling you a twat. Your not a edgy martyr. And your opinion is so short sighted it could be in contact with your cornea and you still wouldn’t see the big picture.
$C: Well you can obviously help your symptoms by treating your body right.  Eating a balanced diet and having regular exercise has documented positive affects on the symptoms of ADHD.  Just like this mental illness though, not everyone has the exact same symptoms or experiences.  There is no cure for ADHD but only ways to manage symptoms.
$C: The same way you and Hitler killed 42 million people. When you change your diet and lifestyle, of course your brain chemistry is going to follow.
$C: [removed]
$C: Sounds like you're not aware of the monopolies these companies have in certain places. We don't have a free market. 

You need to remember that when Ajit Pai says free he means for massive wealthy corporations. It will be anything but free for the end user, the people of this united states. Comcast will make a killing though! Wooooooooooo!
$C: Have you seen the internet in Portugal?
$C: By brainwashed you mean educated? If you're an Aryn Rand cultist you've obviously never read a single economics text book in your entire life. No economist believes in voodoo economics, not even Adam Smith himself. Only economists hired by republicans seeking tax cuts argue for minimal regulation but even they know it is bullshit. 
$C: I assume you're talking about the theory that they will be able to compete better now by offering limited services since they dont have to provide full coverage for all data right? Except Large ISPs which already have the capacity to handle everything will not suddenly lose that capacity. Little guys will still get steamrolled the only difference is they'll get crushed by a branch of the company instead of the whole company. You're small ISPs are mom and pop shops and Verizon is walmart except they dont even need to build a whole store to crush you anymore. 
$C: You are literally an old Grocery store owner standing outside of his modest storefront and admiring the new Wal-Mart being constructed across the street and telling random passersby that this will bring you more customers...
$C: https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20161018/14062235832/ftc-warns-att-court-victory-throttling-could-screw-consumers-decades.shtml

Right, it totally did*'nt*.

Consumer outcry caused them to backpedal, because with cell phone service there is actual competition and people could jump ship.

In the wired world of internet / home internet there is no competition in most major metropolitan areas... so consumers can go fuck themselves.
$C: Telephones are a public utility which is what the net neutrality decision classified the internet as in 2015 and is what is being removed by the current FCC action.
$C: Delusional and stupid: What a mix! Im sure the ladies love you lolol.  Go fuck yourself.  You are human cancer.
$C: Well I don’t think that’s possible in my current career field. And I’m not able to just “Quit” my job.
$C: Now Comcast can throttle services, like they’ve done to Netflix before to push they’re on services?

It’s not illegal for them to do it now.
$C: I didn't think it was possible for you to spew out a even more retarded comment than before, but here we are.
$C: I think it’s much more basic than that though. One side assumes the government is going to save them and the other side doesn’t trust them. I think it’s because of the check they get.
$C: Comcast will provide fast internet to wealthy companies, please explain how small business will experience growth from this.
Also you realize that this deregulation is funded by huge corporations right? 
$C: No. Repealing net neutrality is giving corporations direct control over the internet. It gives Comcast/att/Warner control over what websites they choose to send to you. If they don't want a site existing, all they have to do is cut you off from it. They were not allowed to do this in the past. Right libs like you are fundamentally fucking yourself over. They are fucking with the "free market" by eliminating it altogether, and are probably raising taxes by increasing prices for schools and librarys. Net Neutrality being repealed is bad for everyone
$C: Shit, I'm sorry.  I hadn't read what you actually posted there.
$C: But net neutrality was literally never at all intended to make it so that any website must provide equal platforms to all political views.  You just have no comprehension of what net neutrality is and have no logical point to make.  Try understanding things that you try to talk about in the future so you don't look quite this stupid.
$C: Even if that was true it's not because of net neutrality

Simple fact of the matter is: If Hillary were President today, you'd still have Net Neutrality. 

And now you don't. 

So, congrats, you deserve this. Hooray. Enjoy it. Keep sticking your head in the sand.

Do you see where you logic failed?  No?  Of course not.  I got 5 downvotes and you got 10 upvotes.  That is the reason this country is so fucked.  You fucking idiots don't even know basic definitions.

What you just described is CORPORATISM.  Not CAPITALISM.  Learn the mother fucking difference.
$C: Aside from Bernie Sanders, I don't recall anyone referring to themselves as a socialist. Even Bernie isn't an outright socialist himself. As long as any of them want private businesses to exist, by definition, they aren't socialist. They may advocate for social programs, but that's hardly socialism. My point still being that the rest of the first worlds Right wing parties still advocate for more social programming than the Dems.

$C: Lol if you are seriously stupid enough to think companies will take the hit and not make you pay anything then you should def go back to economy 101.

If it's not the ISP it will be the company that has to pay for better website placement. 

Do you think they'll let you the choice? omg, not suprised some people are for no NN with your thinking. Pretty sure you are against it too, idk why.
Let me predict you how it's gonna work : 

1. Youtube for example will have to pay premium price to have a good stream service from the ISP. Then YT will make you pay a subscription to access their service. "Wait, ClickerHeroes1505, why I would not go to another streaming service then with cute cats vidz?" you may ask. Well, because YT will also pay ISPs to fuck over any other new website that doesnt have billions of dollars to fight against them. And when they'll spend thousand or millions of dollars to ISPs to throttle those websites, do you know what will happen? Your subscription fee will go up, and up, and up.

2. ISP will just sell YT & such in a package for X$, while YT pays for more brandwitch and pays to fuck over any other streaming website.

3. Both of them will ask you for a subscription.

The first one is more likely to happen, 2nd will happen if the ISP gives back some money to YT so they can compensate the loss from having to pay the ISP. 3rd will happen if the ISP doesnt give a single fuck and dont give back some money to YT.

Yea, companies like YT and Reddit are not here for giving you money, they are not philantropist. And it's exactly why, while free now, they'll make you pay later. Any hit took on their earning they'll have to win it back, and it's not with staying free it will happen. Either way you will have even more adds which your addblocker will never be able to block which will be the equivalent of the cable television : one website page, 5 min pub, one page, 5 min pub, ... or a subscription.

Another solution will be personal ISP groups emerging, but don't worry, the FCC or idk which name they'll find for their next "let's fuck up internet for good" party will sooner or later fuck that pretty hard too only allowing A / V / C to operate.

Also, believe it or not, it would be for the best for reddit to have no NN. They could pay pretty hard to virtualy shut down any other website that is close to their format / goal being one of the most profitable one and force you a fee saying "sorry guyz, not our fault, it's the no NN but we promise it's not on our end" and 99% of the redditors would buy it. But even the reddit team knows internet is not supposed to work like that and it's good for no one at the end of the long long day.

Btw i don't give a single fuck about the no NN in US, not from here and don't care, just hope the stupidity of your governement will not influence the rest of the world.
$C: You’re right. Why the fuck are we allowing this? Seriously, how did this happen? How is it that so few people can make these ridiculous decisions that affect *hundred of millions* all just due to bribery and stuffing their pockets? Why? Why are people so clueless? Why are people so ignorant and delusional? Why have we lost everything about our government that is “for the people”? 

Why do we pay billions upon billions in taxes to just continually get fucked? 
$C: Oh, so noowww taxation is theft, right.
$C: You sir are the biggest asshole on the internet today. 
$C: And he doesn’t care.

He just doesn’t fucking care.

That’s what really bites about him - he knows and is totally indifferent to it.
$C: As best I can tell from reading posts, no one in the world knows as much as the average political message board poster. Everyone who has managed to become rich and/or powerful is "clueless," while we posters are both insightful and omniscient.

$C: What're we gonna do, stab him

$C: Donald Trump nominated him as Chairman in January 2017.  Obama had him fill a Republican seat in 2011, not as Chairman.
$C: not true - he was on the FCC, nominated in 2011 to fill a Republican position by Barack Obama.  Donald Trump nominated him as Chairman in January.
$C: This is a false statement that shows a clear lack of care towards correct information.
$C: He was made chairman by Trump, as had already been said here. 
$C: Enjoy paying for the Reddit pack to access T_D in a few months

$C: It kind of looks like you all are based on the comments I am seeing here. “He was mean to her”, “He is such an idiot”, “He isn’t smart”.  You guys are hilarious. 
$C: Which they are, the autistic screeching on reddit doesn't really effect real life

$C: 2k likes and 56k dislikes. Nice

$C: I can't view it. Taken down because of copyright claims...
$C: Did he think the glasses were supposed to be a trend or something? They were for an eclipse. The eclipse happened quite some time ago. Only an idiot wears eclipse glasses indoors, but I guess idiots aren't filtered out in the new administration's screening process.

$C: What a fucking cunt

$C: Even as someone who supports the repeal of NN, I find that video kind of cringe. Not that the message is bad - it's correct; the day to day activity of internet users will not be changed. 

but that he needs to counter the chicken little propaganda being spammed everywhere, and putting out flippant videos like this is not exactly helping combat that narrative.
$C: If you are in the Bay area let me pimp Sonic for a bit.  Great ISP with free vpn service and a commitment to NN.

$C: Fuck those companies. Let's be slaves to these other companies!
$C: They deserve to be broken up under monopoly laws and have their board of directors investigated for corruption 
$C: I, for one, am totally in support of NN fanbois collectively disappearing from the internet :) 
$C: >all major internet companies should sacrifice weeks of revenue in protest of regulation that does not change their business model one iota.

good luck with that

or

>webservice providers should selectively punish individual users based on the policy decisions of their elected  representatives

because that's not totalitarian and overreach of power whatsoever

or

>deny certain red states an equal voice in deciding the future of policy

Ahhhhhh, so the true colors finally come out!

my god listen to yourself. 

$C: This. I know that Ajit Pai never raped and murdered four girls in 1998. It’s not like he’s a bad guy or anything. He never ever raped and murdered four girls in 1998.
$C: I believe it's called a fidget spinner, but I like twat-copter better. 
$C: The part with the fidget spinner, eclipse glasses, and santa costume was well-written and was pretty funny, if you ignore how it's trying to excuse such a terrible policy change.

The rest just made me hate him more, with his terrible acting and with trivial topics that completely miss the purposes of the internet in America today. It trivialized people's concerns and regarded those politically-active citizens as if they were children throwing a tantrum.
$C: The guys a bumbling cock womble.
$C: I think many many people don't realize how angry people actually are about this. If Ajit Pai is recognized in public, he might just be going to the hospital.
$C: >"hey we are taking away your internet freedom to spite Obama!

But he's calling it "Restoring Internet Freedom"! He seems like a trustworthy guy to me! 
$C: It seems to be coming down to that being the only thing left.

$C: Is it illegal to wish death upon the head of the FCC like it is the president?
$C: Obama is consistently used as a foil for much of the GOP and Trump actions.  The GOP base is generally responsive to it, it seems or so they apparently think.
$C: Can someone edit the video to have "sorry you've hit your upload quota" and "you must upgrade to premium tier to stream" type errors throughout?
$C: Is there any way to reverse this if trump doesn’t get in next time? Or does it just become significantly harder? 
$C: SOMEONE PUNCH HIM ALREADY
$C: Well it’s spite Obama and try to remind Trump supporters that Obama=bad. Even if you didn’t like Obama not everything he did could be wrong. Then again I don’t like Trump and I can’t say I’ve found much to like. 
$C: There is nothing factually incorrect. What was repealed WAS Obama era regulation. He did not say he's doing it spite anyone. 

Good job, though, showing how needlessly violent the Left can be over small shit like this. Reported
$C: back the fuck up goys, we got a badass in here

$C: Obama appointed this guy at the advice of Mitch McConnell. It's all public. 
$C: Incite violence against another human being because he hurt your feelings? You are disgusting, but I hope you find peace in your tormented heart.

$C: [deleted]
$C: Don’t be a cunt, we’ve already got enough of them running the government.
$C: Outrage has been mounting since July and the FCC still voted against NN so I don't see how this will be any different with a Republican controlled Congress.
$C: Just curious, if local governments pass NN laws, aren't they just overwritten by the FCC anyway? Would it be just a symbolic gesture or could that actually have traction?
$C: He just did
$C: You are all acting like Ajit is satan or some shit because he's doing his job if you're that mad blame the ISPS leave the fucking guy alone this is why i hate the left they jump to disgusting attacks calls for assassinations revolutions etc  every time they don't get their way

$C: Bullshit. If your father is part of the problem, you’re going to catch hell. Rightfully so. 
$C: All he cares about is the Verizon money from his friends
$C: Or it shows that the Dems are really out over their skis on this one, and Pai et al recognize their melodrama is unwarranted posturing for political points. 
$C: There's a German word, "backpfeifengesicht", that roughly translates to "punchable face". I'm not sure there's a better word to describe Ajit Pai. 
$C: It's sad that more and more I see the only option that makes any sense is praying to Frank Castle. 
$C: Probably still on retainer to be honest....

$C: No, but I've always wanted to write or edit. There just isn't much opportunity to do so in the small town in which I live.
$C: Your thought was a whole lot nicer than mine was. 
$C: It's also a huge sticking point for pro-corporate libertarians/ancaps who fight to ensure there's a boot on their throat as long as it's privately owned and profitable. 
$C: They think everything is am issue of party. "this net neutrality thing is a democrat thing, therefore evil!" 
$C: Ok please don’t use the whole trump supporter thing man. This is not a partisan issue. I lean right but am for NN, and don’t want the whole left/right divide coming into this.
$C: When was this "prior to net neutrality" period?  Are you talking about when it was classified under Title 1 or the Open Internet Order of 2010 or the open Internet principles est in 2005 or what?
$C: You totally just made that up, and it's sad. You're pretending to be something you're not to defend a position you understand even less about and you're getting worked up about it.

What is your life so sorely lacking, right now? What emptiness inside are you desperately trying to ignore? It's ok. Find the the people in your life who want to help you, and let them help you. Don't be afraid to reach out for help, you'll be glad you did someday.

Until then, fuck off sock puppet
$C: "No, the UK and France chose to attack Germany. Germany had a very good reason to invade Poland, which has to do with a right of way to East Prussia. I'm not saying it was right, but if the UK and France stayed out of it, chances are, there would of never been a WW2. When France and UK attacked Germany, Italy and their allies joined in to help Germany from the attack. Why was Russia never attacked for doing the same exact thing that Germany did, in fact, Russia invaded Poland first. Do some critical thinking on this. There were other reasons why they chose to attack Germany, and it was b/c Germany was against the Zionist and their control of the world banks."

$C: Thats what they want you to believe
$C: > We (Merica) are not a democracy, we are a constitutional republic.

I always thought this was a strange thing to say. You may not be a direct democracy, but few places are, you are a representative democracy - you vote for people to represent you. You are *also* a constitutional republic. The two aren't exclusive.
$C: A republic is any country that isn't a monarchy. We are a constitutional democratic republic, which means we are a republic with a specific document outlining the government, and with elections.
$C: Yellowstone Volcano 2020
$C: "Republic" just means there is no monarch. "Democracy" means that people vote. They are neither mutually exclusive nor mutually inclusive; they are entirely different axes on the "what kind of government is this" graph.

I don't appreciate you people continuing to spread anti-democracy propaganda. Unlike you, I'm going to continue to fight so that "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."


$C: Well, they're only in office because people put them there.
$C: Republican or Democrat doesn't matter. That's the bullshit they keep you distracted with. An asshole is an asshole, no matter where it sits.
$C: I was also deeply disappointed to find a representative for our state on that list, and 100% agree with your sentiment. 
$C: >It's just really depressing that people are getting paid millions just to vote a certain way.

Thousands. Not even millions.


$C: Someone’s gonna have to drag them out of their offices by force and sit their ass down at a town hall meeting. Spineless fucks. Can’t even face their own people.
$C: I never said it was the sole reason you should or shouldn’t vote for someone. It should be a factor in deciding who you’re going to vote for though. 
What I was getting at with my initial comment is a representative not representing what their constituents want because of self-interest. That’s bad. 
$C: I'm specifically referring to those who actively participated. Polling has already indicated 80% of Americans support net neutrality. Being obtuse to support your politics is only a certain amount of cute, and that's mostly none.
$C: Someone said there's a 60 day limit for repealing something, after rules have been presented to Congress. So the question is, were the 2015 rules ever presented to Congress? If so, when?

If it's been more than 60 days, then they are protected. But if not, then we need to push to get them presented so that the timer can expire and new Congressman down the line can't overturn them with an easy "no" vote.

The other thing is, well, the courts have basically said that Title II is the only way the FCC can enforce Net Neutrality, and the 2017 rules revert it to Title I. So, after seeing that, I stopped reading the proposed rule because that's all I needed to know to oppose them. So, my question is: Is there anything in the 2017 order I would like? 

Overturning this decision as a whole I'm for, but when you say "Nothing similar can be presented", does that mean only that a new FCC can't again repeal Title II, or would particular details that maybe do something good that I don't know about can't ever be a part of future rulemaking, ever?

I think we should ask Free Press about this topic. They [just posted an AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7jtes4/fcc_just_voted_to_kill_net_neutrality_now_we_will/) today, and knowing the details so an informed decision can be made on whether to push for or against something like this is important.
$C: Another question:

People had been passing around [this bill, H.R.4585](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4585/text) before the text of it was even available to be read yet. However, I checked today, and the text has now been published. Here's what it says:

>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

>SECTION 1. Short title.

>This Act may be cited as the “Save Net Neutrality Act of 2017”.

>SEC. 2. Rulemaking in reliance on Internet Freedom NPRM prohibited.

>Beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, the Federal Communications Commission may not rely on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the matter of restoring internet freedom that was adopted by the Commission on May 18, 2017 (FCC 17–60), to satisfy the requirements of section 553 of title 5, United States Code, for adopting, amending, revoking, or otherwise modifying any rule (as defined in section 551 of such title) of the Commission.

To me it looks like it would invalidate public commentary as having any relevance to the FCC's decisions going forward. "Ignore the public" seems to be the opposite of what we want.

But I'm not a lawyer. What would this actually do?
$C: r/MarchForNetNeutrality
$C: But at the very least point out the fault. 
$C: I'm deeply concerned for your deep concern.
$C: The letters to Santa are part of the public record and can be used in court as evidence against the FCC decision to overturn the 2015 rules. They are useful, even if they had no affect on Ajit. 

I think one thing we need to do, is talk to people about "zero rating". It goes against Net Neutrality, but on the surface looks like something good. "Wow, you mean I can use Spotify without eating into my data plan? What a deal!"

However, what's the difference between whitelisting one site as zero-rated, and blacklisting every other site on the net as costing data? Or, if whitelisting one site as zero-rated on the net is ok, then how about two or three? Four? How about... whitelisting *every* site on the net as zero-rated, *except* for YouTube? Is it ok if only one site on the net eats into your data allotment? 

People are so used to having very limited data plans on mobile that anything that saves them a few bytes seems like a great deal, so it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking zero-rating is a good idea.

Ajit Pai said that because zero rating is something customers want, it should be allowed, which is why to get rid of Title II so it can be. Which means that, if we want to nullify his argument, we need to talk to customers and explain what the pitfalls are, and get everyone on board against zero rating.

There is the source from the EFF for Comcast interfering with p2p communication (aka bittorrent).

Also, there is a huge sourced list here: https://www.freepress.net/blog/2017/04/25/net-neutrality-violations-brief-history

Not /u/SoylentGreenIsPurple, but I hope that answered your question and is able to help you when you discuss this with people close to you.
$C: Maybe not a transparent BitTorrent client, but many online games use(d) custom, single-purpose BitTorrent clients for their launchers/downloaders/updaters in order to reduce the load on their own servers on patch day. I'm not sure if anyone is still doing it, but I know that World of Warcraft had a BitTorrent-based launcher back in its heydey, along with an option to use a standard downloader if your ISP throttled BitTorrent traffic.
$C: Have you ever met anyone who plays any Blizzard video games? Because they all rely on torrents.
$C: Seconding /u/MyCodeIsCompiling

I just got a new work computer last month, and have since then via torrents downloaded at least 30 gigs worth of *nix .isos to run on my VirtualBox.

Per your argument, you might as well say that because I own a car and a gun, and purchased both from private sellers, I'm Clyde fucking Barrow. Which is quite the unfair presumption.
$C: know anyone using linux? cuz they probably got it from torrents. the files large enough that it'd be a pain if you tried downloading that on a network and anything came up

$C: Next lets boycott our local power company and water company. Modern life requires network access and there are many places where there is only the one mega ISP available with usable service. And to be honest going from Comcast to CenturyLink is really not going to help anyone.
$C: Isn't the whole point of this that the internet ISNT something we can live without?

That's why we want the internet governed as a utility, it is something we can't live without. Asking people to boycott the internet is akin to asking them to walk outside and switch off their main power breaker and shut their main water line.
$C: Sorry to break it to you, but people can't/won't stop having internet anymore than they will stop buying water or power. I can't quit having electricity in protest to try to force my electric company to stop overcharging me or just stop having power until a competitor runs wires to my house. 

The internet is quite literally a requirement for modern life at this point, and the duopoly in power know this.

I'd lose $5k a month if I dropped internet, and I am not alone. I do live in an area with competition but the majority of people do not. 

Even those who do have competition in their local area ALL OF THE COMPETITORS are in collusion on this bullshit. Comcast, TWC, AT&T and every other major nationwide ISP has a media conglomerate that they want to use their last mile control to direct profits to.

You know what's supposed to keep these guys from abusing this power? Title 2 and other regulations on public utilities that are "natural monopolies." The only reason those laws exist is because it's not possible to boycott or move to competing suppliers.
$C: 100% M8. 100%.
$C: > But people are stupid.

Really? That's the depth of your analysis?

>Sure, I could fix this all, if they'd listen

Oh, yes. If only people would stop everything and listen to you, everything would be solved. Because you have all the answers.

*Everybody* thinks this, and that's precisely the reason *why* the Left doesn't get mobilized more. Everybody thinks they know what the problems are and how to solve them, and most of them disagree.

What we really need are *not* more people saying, "Hey, I can fix all of this if you'll just listen to me!" We have enough of those people already. What we need are people saying, "Tell me what the problem is and I'll listen."
$C: Well u/spez still keeps T_D around so I don't know if I put his word up like it is gospel.
$C: There is a fine line when a protest becomes a riot. One is illegal and paints us as terrorists and criminals the other paints us as unhappy citizens and, if we get harmed, martyrs. Results to protests are not always seen or felt but one protest can inspire more until we get what we want.
$C: It lead to a lot more people being aware and vocal with politics.

The more we continue to do these kind of protests the more our voices will be heard. The issue is that after the Women's March we didn't keep it up. We should be striving to protest at least once a week.
$C: I have literally never seen a single argument against net neutrality that didn't contain outright lying, denial, attempts to change the topic, or praxeology bullshit.
$C: Isnt thtlat technically taking bribes because the isps had a huge stake in this vote seems very fishy
$C: Right, this should be an *easy* one. We just want them not to fuck with something that's been working up until now.
$C: Nope: http://imgur.com/a/WfNg1

I'm not saying you're 100% a Russian shell, but your account certainly looks like the other ones that are swarming FCC threads today.
$C: You mean those who weren't on the receiving end moved on. Those who experienced Reddit's uneven hand knew better than to trust anything they have to say, even /u/arabscarab. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: True.

However, It’s worth noting that Roy Moore was only up 10 points in the polls before the allegations came to light.  Trump won Alabama by 28 points.  That hints that this is a national voting environment that’s not good for republicans who want to run for Congress at the moment.  This might scare a few republicans into deciding to support NN since it has 76% public approval. 

$C: Either I don't know what the word pedophile means or I can't find any info on him that fits the official description:

 >Pedophilia or paedophilia is a psychiatric disorder in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children.

Make no mistake, what I did find is 1000000x bad enough to keep him out of office but I just haven't understood the pedophile comments.
$C: Good bot
$C: Oh yeah. Having this current congress write the law we need would be a horrible idea. My point was simply that having the FCC in charge of NN rules is going to continue being a problem until we get laws that actually provide proper rules. 
$C: Socially yes, we have. Nixon in one of his campaigns ran with a suggestion of implementation of a basic universal income, which now is only the purview of true democrats. The idea of abortion has gone from a 60 to 70 % favor in the 70s to a more even split which might see an even more conservative push in the next 10 to 15 years. The defense of gun rights has become a rabid issue for conservatives and despite Democrat highlight of mass shootings there is no sign of public opinion shift, indicating further conservative lean in the political middle.  Yes in some ways social issues have gone more liberal ie gay rights and equal opportunity, but the general trend is pushing conservative, not liberal.

$C: I have no idea about the laws surrounding that. I'm not sure how someone or a company can force a NDA when both sides haven't accepted or gone into negotiations. If a company or person comes up to you with a proposition and you haven't signed anything. I think it's fair game to go out and tell people what they plan to do. But who knows. There might be some law that goes against this. 
$C: That'd be some real orwellian shit man.

$C: You aren't gonna be able to convince people who've already made up their mind unless their ideology specifically revolves around considering new ideas. The purpose of things like this is to convince the unsure center-right and hopefully more people of political power in america
$C: You're assuming conservatives are even liking this bullshit; statistically they're as protective of net neutrality.
$C: They tried. FCC sued them. It wasn't until 2012 when courts decided that the FCC didn't have the power to enforce Net Neutrality. Which is why they were moved to Title II. So it now had the power to enforce it.

$C: That's brave
$C: You just violated Reddit's golden rule.
$C: Oi shut up a minute
$C: You are assuming that they are going to blacklist websites that don't pay.

It is much, much more likely that they will whitelist. They will slow or block *everything* and then take payment to whitelist.

And they will never, ever whitelist proxies that let you bypass their pricing structures. The proxies will be slow because they aren't on the whitelist, and they will probably also try to blacklist as many of them as possible (blocking them entirely) too.

Proxies will only be useful to users who pay out the nose for "unlimited" internet, which largely defeats the purpose since at that point you'll have paid to escape most of the throttling anyway. And even then, given that proxies are often used to bypass region restrictions, it's not at all unlikely that "unlimited" packages will still have proxy blacklists to appease the people putting those region restrictions there in the first place (which is even more likely since all major US ISPs are media companies - they're some of the people doing the region locking).

This is not a new age of proxies, this is the death of proxies.

$C: They can throttle international traffic just as easily. But making Reddit more international (by, say, providing more Gold benefits that can be used outside the US) would be one way to go forward. 
$C: Why would massive American ISPs have spent so much money campaigning and paying off officials if they weren’t expecting a massive profit increase after the murder of Net Neutrality?
$C: Most places only have 1 ISP, and the FCC will block anybody trying to compete, so it’s impossible for them to lose customers.
$C: son did you just go full retard
$C: No, we always had net neutrality because the FCC always enforced it. 2015 is when we found out that the FCC didn't technically have the power to do that, so they changed the classification so they did. We were only without net neutrality rules for a brief period between the lawsuit and the title 2 classification.
$C: You have no idea what you’re talking about. Al Gore is on record in the 90s talking about protecting freedom and openness on the internet and banning discrimination by providers. Tim Wu came up with the term Net Neutrality in 2003, describing the principles behind the peering agreements that were already industry standard. In 2004, the chairman of the FCC came out with principles of internet freedom, and the next year brought regulatory action against an ISP that was blocking VOIP services. There were multiple attempts to codify net neutrality into law in the 2000s. Then Verizon successfully sued the FCC saying that their regulatory actions were not through their legal authority in regulating Information Services, and they would have to use Title II if they wanted to regulate ISPs, so they did.

The reclassification to Title II in 2014 is just part of a battle that stretches back into the 90s, and net neutrality has been protected by regulators since the mid-2000s.
$C: Yeah, and the internet and it's controllers are but a child relatively speaking, younger than society as a hole, and so are also still figuring new ways to make money, which is understandable. As a result, yes the internet wasn't "broken" before these rules were put into place, but it started too back in 2010 between Verizon and Netflix. Slowly isps realize, "hey we can do this" and it would have spurred up more had these regulations not been in place. 

It happens in other countries, and happens in a way with our mobile data. Verizon doesn't like to admit it but theyve started to throttle back unlimited data bandwidth in a number of cases. 

Tl:dr sure the internet wasn't like this before, but it was starting too before these regulations were put into place. That's why they exist. 

Additional: in the regulations themselves are multiple instances reference as reasons for most of the rule's clauses.
$C: How about n- *bzzt* Verizon is really cool and won’t ever partake in censorship!
$C: They won't be so stupid to outright block Reddit (or any website they disagree with).  They'll introduce slightly slower load times; a bit of stutter to videos/audio.  Just enough to that after a few such annoying experiences, users won't return.

This will also happen to political candidates they don't support, by the way.  It's disastrous.
$C: Sounds like something they would do.
$C: Face it man. Our freedoms went out the window a long time ago. 90% of people in prison never receive a fair trial. Your 4th amendment was raped by the cia and fbi long ago and now by the NSA. Your 2nd amendment is slowly vaporizing. The first is going to be the last to go, but it will. Next thing you know the constitution will be little more than a piece of paper long forgotten.
$C: Elliot Spitzer singehandedly destroyed USENet... Which *dwarfed* Reddit (as a percent of all intenet traffic) at its peak.

99% of people will just move on and buy the "Social Media+" tier from their sole choice of "local" ISPs.
$C: That's not what freedom of speech means.
$C: Hey wait.  r/the_donald  is already being censored isn't it?  Wrong think gets ya everytime.

$C: Don't be a cunt, dude. If you don't like Reddit then why are you here, on Reddit?
Edit: I see, it's because you're a troll account
$C: Acct created today. You fucking pussy. 


$C: lol you fucking bitch...this affects you to....
$C: It only makes sense in crazy leftist-land.
$C: These are the same retards that want to take away guns, not caring that that is a constitutional right.
$C: >Reddit is a place for people to share ideas.

But it is not only that. Reddit is also an organization, which can take a political stance. On matters of net neutrality they are now doing that.

They are not consistent in that. Just look at it: There is big macho bluster being thrown out now, calling ISPs terrorists. Now that it's too late to influence anything, and now that, at least on this site, we have big political consensus on this issue. Now they have the big words to throw around. How brave.

But in that election campaign that led to this mess? Did reddit as an organization support and throw their weight behind a candidate who supported net neutrality? Did it call out other candidates, who did not support net neutrality, as terrorists? No? *Why?*

Maybe I am demanding too much. But reddit could have done more in this election season, if net neutrality really was important to them as an organization. I would have loved an admin post which made it very clear what the different candidates' positions on net neutrality were, and what consequences your voting behavior would have on that policy. I do not think such a post ever happened. *Why?*

We all know why. A certain sub would have caused all kinds of trouble if reddit had taken such a clear public position against them. Now they are calling ISPs terrorists. But did they dare to say anything to the people whose candidate has desroyed net neutrality? Did they oppose that candidate when it counted? No. 

When it counted reddit, as an organization, failed to support net neutrality, by failing to support and endorse proponents of net neutrality.

When they would have had to face opposition for making their stance clear, for throwing their support behind the people who politically stood for net neutraltiy, when reddit could have changed something, they failed.

Let me say that again reddit: **Reddit as an organization failed to support net neutrality when it counted. And when it counted was in this election season.**
$C: That comparison starts and ends at 'censorship'. The two are not equivocal in the slightest.

If The_Donald was a platform for discussion, then you could make that arguement. But since any/every bit of criticism doled in their direction is met with bans, and they go out of their way to push their agenda, it's very clear to see that that forum is more of a soapbox than a platform. And that soapbox has been used tell everyone to 'get over it' to this very thing this topic is about.

Again, until they realized it would affect them, too.

If Reddit is an entity unto itself, like a nation, that is to care of things of free speech and censorship, then why should we allow one place to treat others like said place is an overzealous island?

$C: > shills, trolls, or ignorant. 

Sounds about right
$C: Might be more Russian bots in there than I thought. I don’t see how even Trump supporters can be for this. Unless they actually bought into the “Obama era regulations” nonsense. 
$C: One thing to keep in mind is this can be as easily repealed as it was put into place. So people shouldn't forget which party did this and which party will definitely repeal this.

I wish we didn't have a two-party system and it was something people could back everything they believe in, but considering who is likely to be on the ballot on the Republican side the choice should be easy.
$C: Never forget we have the power.   It's an illusion that we don't.  We have the power and we must put aside the smaller matters and unify.   We don't have to accept only two bad sold out choices.  America is the land of choices!   We need candidates that are for us.  We need to keep talking. We need employee owned places to work so that we don't get abused.   None of this is pie in the sky.  
$C: Would have been *great* to get it through Congress before exposing people to this, though. The ISPs agree with you and are laughing all the way to the bank.
$C: What are you saying? No one understands what that means.
$C: > Just because they disagree with you doesn't mean they're automatically a paid shill.

Paid shill, or just an intern. Or maybe the person is too stupid to see Regulatory Capture as a huge problem.
$C: Yes. Something I hope both sides agree on and know only like 5 companies benift from. 
$C: "He has control over the Senate and the courts! He's too dangerous to be left alive."

$C: That's debatable both ways. Think for yourself, don't be a mindless sheep, don't drink the kool-aid.
$C: He didn't make him head of the FCC. Obama was probably willing to do it in a spirit of bipartisanship, you can't predict what someone is going to do in future.
$C: I get that...  some Republicans still believe Obama to be the infamous "Anti-Christ" so they think anything that Obama had a hand in is evil and will vote against him.
$C: >You're basically hoping that a good company that is not too much baled by greed  will come and compete and bring the prices down 

No. This is getting it wrong. 

I hope all companies competing in a marketplace ARE motivated by greed - else they would be a shitty company destined to fail.

Greed breeds competition, and ultimately better services for the end user as the companies compete for customers. 

The problems come along when local/state/federal laws come and meddle with open competition, and make it more favorable for one party over another.

$C: > The last time this happened the worst financial crash in history happened.

We got a preview of this in 2009. I shudder to think what would have happened if we had another Great Depression.

$C: Violence is a tool used by many American heroes, civil rights advocates, ect. Violence created the Unions that stop employers from abusing you. Violence freed the slaves. Violence was part of equal rights for Race and Gender. Violence stopped the Nazis and saved millions of lives. Violence created our Country and maintained it. It is a tool and in some situations it is the best tool for the job. This is one of those situations because all other avenues have been exhausted and the powers of the government themselves are being abused So there it is. There is the solution.     

I know you all won't listen and I know we will lose the internet because of it. I hope your ego and pretentious morality was worth us losing one the greatest wonders of the human world. My resentment is no longer just for the corrupt human garbage that pushed against Net Neutrality, but also now for all of you who allowed it to happen just because you didn't want to get dirty to clean up the filth.    

 Down votes to the left, losers.    
$C: The fact that somebody on the left can be claiming to fight for the notion of freedom is fucking insane. The FCC controlling ISPs has nothing to do with freedom. If you want actual freedom, you cultists should be vocal about fixing local regulations that make it impossible for new ISPs to enter the market. That would solve the problem. But because of your authoritarian, meddling proclivities, you've decided to go all-in for what is AT BEST a bandaid. Again, none of this has fuck-all to do with "freedom."
$C: What about the legality of doxing?
$C: "My wife always burns my breakfast, time to let my cat try cooking"
$C: The good news is that republicans have shown their true colors. No more pretending their motivation is  being fiscally conservative. Unfortunately the blatant racism still plays well with the religious right. 
$C: I know.
$C: "I know Democrats and Berniecrats voted Trump this past 2016". - General Consensus from The_Donald and/or Libertarians.

Right?

Ahh yes, the "Both Parties are the same" ~~fallacy~~ argument. 
$C: No, nothing that Pai et al. are saying is true.  Their main claim is that Title II classification stifled infrastructure investment, which is both false via data, and from the mouth of several providers themselves on shareholder meetings.  ISPs were *mostly* not doing anti-NN things in the past because the FCC had directed them not to, and had attempted to intervene several times.  One of those times, they sued the FCC, and the court said that the FCC could not enforce those regulations under the Title I classification they had at the time, so Wheeler's FCC reclassified them under Title II to correctly regulate them.  Obviously, this is bad for the ISPs profit margins, since it prevents them from charging more for some parts of the internet, so they kicked Ashit Pai some extra compensation to move them back to Title I (now that the court already ruled they can't be regulated there) so they can begin fucking us in earnest.
$C: > They are demonstrating an example of how a giant showing of corruption has already occurred recently and a.) No one did a thing about it. b.) If no one did enough about the recent reveal of corruption in the DNC, which is more significant that the FCC being corrupt, then c.) No one will do enough to fix the corruption in the FCC.

No, I think I'm getting their point, it's just a bad one. The Democrats, right now, need to push internal issues of corruption aside because the fact of the matter is although they have their own slew of problems, theirs pose MUCH less of a threat to contemporary American democracy than those of the Rs on the other side of the aisle

Hillary being chosen in a rigged primary was fucked, but the DNC isn't the FCC. Not everyone in the country pays taxes to the DNC to regulate various economies. The immediate effects on American citizens due to Hillary's election in the primary are not comparable to the effects which will occur due to the NN repeal.

Just because Hillary was brought up, the comment was moot in this discussion. She is the past, this is the future. Bringing up the prior misgivings of the American left are only sewing division amongst interests that MUST remain united against our current ills. 

Sure, by all means, FUCK Hillary, and FUCK corporate interests in politics. I'd love to overhaul the DNC. But none of those problems can adequately be dealt with as long as a modern R is in office, especially one like Trump, so let's remain on point.
$C: Yea they aren't great
$C: >Removing power from the companies who you want to expand 

That's the thing.  None of us want any of the companies in power of the internet to continue being in power.  All of them should be completely broken apart and their infrastructure should be made open to the public.
$C: They had the opportunity to do those things with tax dollars for decades and never did so. They've repeatedly tightened their grip on cable lines and utility poles to the point that even Google couldn't compete. Regulation is some sectors can be stifling but it can also be entirely beneficial in others. This is a situation where they are simply asked to take all traffic equally. It isn't burdensome for them, it doesn't stop them from competing and providing services and it is a valuable consumer protection recognized everywhere in the free world but here.

The end game of this bill is to allow companies to partition the net and charge for it like Cable television. Want Netflix? Sorry that will be extra but you can use the Spectrum on demand service. Want to read the news, here are our affiliated outlets. Sorry, we are in a dispute with the rates we charge Fox and CNN so you can't access those right now. Call them and let them know you as the consumer want their products on our ISP!

There is no defense for this other than the idea that companies grow better without regulation and we should depend on them to act against their own amoral interest for the benefits of the consumer. These companies need to be broken up like ATT back in the day and have their regional monopolies destroyed. 
$C: Yes, because it got to this point, troll.
$C: Did you grow up on a farm? cause that's a real nice strawman you got there. 
$C: That is exactly their role.


$C: I mean this is the first time I've commented on net neutrality I think and I see what you're trying to say. I don't disagree that there are very vehement posting about stealing the internet, and don't take my omission of that from my comment as denying its existence. All I'm saying as that the way that those people choose to express their unhappiness shouldn't detract form the validity of their underlying claims. If my memory serves a lot of the lose posts started with an exclamation then lead into the actual pros and cons. Everyone lies to cover up the past, it's human nature to delude yourself in some manner, the best thing you can do is to listen to others and learn. Also as a genuine question not trying to be snide: what do you think the point is, do you think net neutrality will help consumers?
$C: As an Alabama native the turnout was actually better than 2014 but mostly due to Moore being such a divisive candidate and the Democrats raising 5 times as much money as the Republicans and specifically targeting black voters, thus prompting a turnout of black voters not seen since Obama was elected. Sadly people of Alabama are very stubborn and I know several that actually voted for Moore anyway, simply because they just couldn't bring themselves to vote for a Democrat. Citing ridiculous excuses like what about innocent until proven guilty etc... People just vote for either side regardless of the quality of candidate or what they personally stand for because Democrats have cooties
$C: [deleted]
$C: [deleted]
$C: Bingo!
$C: Are you sure you can hold yourself together well enough to resist corruption yourself?
$C: It is a little dramatic, but the reason Obama did institute net neutrality was because there was a loophole in the law for ISP’s like Verizon and Comcast to charge companies just for using the service known as the internet.
$C: "Both parties are the same" is propaganda to discourage young people from voting.
$C: That's a great analogy, but seriously, what should we do?
$C: I am so freaking angry. I don't even have words

$C: Mixed bag. Speaking out feels so very ineffective lately, and as angry as that makes me I remember that the government had a lot of bullets...
$C: Everyone against net neutrality gets VOTED OUT !
$C: The reason they are being down-voted isn't necessarily because of the call to violence so much as it is the pretentious attitude and blame-game their comment is playing. Pointing fingers and putting all of the blame for something on everyone else's shoulders is just immature and people generally don't want to put up with that shit.
$C: Because Reddit huffs its own farts and thinks individual action can take down an institutional sickness.    

They point out how money has the power to subvert democracy and in the same breath chastise anyone who suggests anything but petitions and voting. 
$C: You not a fan of democracy or something?
$C: Who do you think would be the bitch in that hypothetical prison relationship?
$C: Give it time, it certainly will become quite painful for all but the richest Americans after the Republican tax scam is passed, followed shortly thereafter by cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and who knows what other entitlement programs they've got their eyes on. 
$C: The net neutrality rules weren't placed on the FCC, but rather the FCC under Obama placed the rules on the ISPs. The FCC, being the rule makers, have the ability to repeal the rules at any time by a simple majority, which is what happened here
$C: Only reason I could see why they wouldn't is if Republicans threatened to filibuster it in the Senate. 

However, let's say you're right that they wouldn't try at all. At least she wouldn't have nominated an asshole like Pai to head the FCC, and thus net neutrality would have been preserved for another 4-8 years. 
$C: It also might be a good idea to call your states AG and share your concern, as I know a few other states have already joined the NY AG in saying they will fight the repeal.
$C: Ooh, neat. Am normally a lurker, but the absurd proclamations of doom here led me to comment. But, it's like you don't realize online petitions are always filled with fake names. 
$C: What if you die of stress of vigilance (maybe even literally)?
$C: I've definitely thought about it. My boyfriend has Canadian citizenship and my great grandmother is from Winnipeg. But I think it will have to wait for at least a couple years because I love the work I'm doing now and my boyfriend has 2.5 more years of med school here in the US.
$C: I agree, but who cares about writing representatives anymore? That's SO 2015.

There is precisely one thing that these things understand, and that's losing elections. If we aren't voting AND convincing others to be informed and vote, we're just engaging in verbal masturbation.
$C: Both parties are the same, and there's no such thing as "wasting a vote".
$C: It doesn't need to be that insightful.  It just needs to be heard.
$C: Fortunately Jones won by more than half a percent so the state is under no obligation to conduct a mandatory recount. And a runoff election isn't going to happen either. Moore can cry all he want but he lost.
$C: At what point do we realize we are headed for a totalitarian dictatorship?

Losing an election but refusing to concede and assuming power anyways is inherently undemocratic and something straight out of Russia or the Congo or something.
$C: I mean, if he somehow succeeds and gets appointed you have a point and once it comes to that we should riot - but in all likelihood this is just Moore being a sore loser and nothing will come of it.

$C: No it absolutely could be turned around immediately because they new president could appoint a new chairman of the FCC then vote would be 3 to 2 and NN would be back in place.
$C: RN I'm thinking that the government is the problem...
$C: So you're honestly suggesting that if Net Neutrality isn't reinstated, people should start shooting up Senators? 
$C: **HEY LET'S GO AND HAVE A REVOLUTION** ^after ^I've ^finished ^my ^tendies
$C: Well if you read your history majority of social progress came with violence. I'm not advocating we are at that point, but the person is telling the truth.
$C: > Violence when we don't get what we want, really?

So the french or the American revolutions shouldn't have happened? 
$C: This probably the most naive comment I have ever read. You should especially be ashamed if you are American 
$C: Maybe that would be the tipping point! Millions unable to watch the newest South Park shitting on Ajit Pai...*because* of Ajit Pai.
$C: The Ghost of Internet Past.
$C: But a return to AOL is exactly what Pai and Verizon want!  With Verizon being AOL, Comcast being Compuserve, and AT&T being Prodigy.

$C: If you think just voting for dems is the answer then you have a very weak understanding of the political landscape in the US right now. We live in an oligarchy at this point more or less, and elected officials don't give a damn about the people, their constituents are lobbyists and corporations lol. 
$C: I'd like to add that it's not just voting that we need to do, we need to vote smarter. The only thing worse than not voting is a stupid vote. Not all dems are created equal, nor are all repubs. Part of the problem is voters go in and vote straight ticket. This is not the answer. 

Just food for thought... 
$C: Correct. Everybody tries to rationalize this some way or another. The truth is that if more people voted for better representatives, we would have a better government. It seems insane that people think this won't work.
$C: If they take away one thing at a time, you'll say "it's disappointing! But we can still remove them! Go vote!".  If they keep doing it, one right at a time, you'll go down without a voice.  At some point, enough is enough; I'm a peaceful person. However, I do think that if politicians continue to blatantly act against the people they are supposed to represent, then inevitably it will lead to someone committing a violent act, and I do think there can be justification for that.  They made their decisions, they chose to screw the public over and over on issues that are overwhelmingly not supported; is that really a surprise?
$C: Funny to see all the upvotes on a comment saying people should make people fearful. 
$C: putting our faith in the system!! /s
$C: Net Neutrality being repealed is a symptom. The disease that’s ailed the US for too long is the Lobbying (Legalized Corruption), Corporatism, and Imperialism that is inherent in the American System. That’s what these comments are about.
$C: you clearly dont see the bigger picture 
$C: No, like realizing when you purposefully fuck over your country we call it treason and hang your treasonous ass from a DC light pole.

I'm not saying to do it, but they should certainly have the fear it can be done. 
$C: Due to the mention of fear as a result of death... I don't think so. I personally think that is a bit extreme, but I'm sure there were many people in history on the same line before revolution. Corruption is scary and when a whole population of people is led to feel powerless and scared, fight or fight kicks in. People do what they have to do to survive and provide when the government is effecting their quality of life in a lot of aspects.

Edit: How in the world is this controversial? Do you like democracy? Ideology. Do you not like democracy? Ideology. Do you believe we shouldn't even care about politics? That's a fucking ideology. I'm beginning to think people don't quite understand the word ideology...
$C: So what are you advocating murdering people for then?
$C: > Let's wait until it's literally impossible to resist the tyrannical government to use violence. That'll work."

That would be banning guns... which only the Democrats are trying to do at the moment and for about the past 50 years.
$C: No, you said ["American Revolution"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War).  Aka a literal war where people were getting killed.

TBH I'm not sure if it's worse that you're advocating murder, or that you seriously want a civil war...

I mean, you could go "lol jk", but I've been assuming a lot of sarcasm and hyperbole from the far left, only to realize they were serious.
$C: Lol you dont know how a democracy works if that's what you believe.
$C: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE


MUH INTERWEBZ BURN DOWN THE GUBMENT!


YO have some tendies and CALM THE FUCK DOWN.
The fuck is with the disrespect anyway?

I don't recall the internet being any different 3 years ago. Don't believe everything your told. Think for yourself.

And besides all that you know there's like a laundry list of ways the government is fucking you, but your dumb fat ass only gets worked up about your YouTube and pornhub
$C: Avid? 2 comments counts as avid?

But to answer your question, it's because fuck all you little worms that look to the federal govt to spoon feed you everything.
$C: Nobody ever asked for my vote. Your polls don’t properly reflect the will of all Americans including those that don’t use the internet. 

Or the elderly that stand to see their internet bill go down with this. 
$C: Lol you just compared net neutrality to murder. Hahahahahahaabahabahababababahahahabahahahabahahahahahahabah oh my GOD the delusion is real!
$C: MLK died before he saw any success from his actions. 
$C: Most of whom are so poorly paid that they cannot afford to do this and subsequently lose their job. Many are choosing between eating or following corporate orders.
$C: We already did November 8th. What do you think that revolution was about?
$C: I don't think it's fair to call believing in the righteous thing "childish." It may be naive, but I think that's valuable. We need people willing to do the righteous thing to keep society in line. 
$C: **#RISE**
$C: I love that you (and others) are being downvoted for saying you don't want people to attack or kill others.

Never change, reddit
$C: Net neutrality didn't even exist a few years ago. You people are like Chicken Little shrieking that the sky is falling.

It really shows your age, though. And I have a hard time imagining a successful revolution being pulled off by a bunch of 14 year olds.
$C: LOL power cables. You are fucking stupid.
$C: You are aware people have had riots in the US multiple times without being "crushed". The military doesn't come in and start bombing and shooting people who simply riot lol.

I don't know what that person was really suggesting we do in terms of violence. However I don't think they were saying we should wage actual warfare lol. And the idea of our military attacking citizens is a whole different subject anyway.

I'm not sure what else you could mean though. All that happens is the police arrest people. If shit gets real, some people get hurt or killed.. Most people however don't face any consequences of rioting.

It really depends on the violence one uses. If someone goes out and begins systematically murdering people that isn't really going to work out well for them. Trying to organize some kind of militia and bomb or siege shit? Fuck good luck lol, you are gonna get shut down. But a protest turning violent and into a riot? I think this is more in tune with what they meant and really, sometimes the public has to use these means to be heard and considered. No denying it is a powerful way to be heard as a whole
$C: LOL, I'm not trying to convince some disgusting piece of Trump supporting shit anything. They are fucking marked.
$C: Well you keep sending letters then it's obviously helping so much.

Ammo? This issue is already a very clear topic and most people are already decided. It's kind of silly to use this logic to try to sway someone from calligraphy for violence. Do you think someone who wants violence to break out gives as fuck if they're heard and judged? Obviously people will judge the actual violence more either way. They are calling for violence because they feel it is past the point of people forming their opinions.

It's already been shown that the opinions of people here don't matter anyway
$C: You have no clue how violent we can become. So don't call me a pussy over the internet. When our backs are pushed to the wall some of us will will fight back  
$C: Relatively quiet as they need to be to get away with the act 

Unless they want a loud message then all bets are off
$C: We will see if people actually go through with impactful violence. Trolls can still die from overreating. 
$C: How in the hell could you know any of that you ignorant asshole? Who the fuck are you? Do you have cameras on this guy? Please shut the fuck up about anything you don't know about. That should be common sense, but clearly you don't possess an ounce of that. You're the one with the big mouth here. Fill it with cocks, PLEASE.
$C: US was actually quite peaceful by any standard. One civil war during the course of 250 years, that's a damn good track record.
$C: I know you're not condoning violence but do you really think people who couldn't be bothered to vote are going to go risk their lives over a hypothetical future scenario?


$C: The sides wouldn't be Trump supporters vs the rest.

It would be supporters of the status quo vs the rest. That's an entirely different thing
$C: I agree with everything this guy said except the bullshit about not condoning violence
$C: I don't condone violence either. Violence leads to more violence and eventually full scale war. Neighbor and brother against neighbor and brother. Which is why it's very dangerous to talk about violent revolution.

There'd likely at least be countryside revolts all over the country given how that is where the support for the far right lies.
$C: Did you just call me insane for supporting a candidate?
$C: Which is why real automatic weapons (machine guns), anti tank weapons, armored vehicles, anti air missiles, and artillery are essential to a revolution. Support from foreign powers is also needed in the form of weapons, money, and other resources.
$C: Not right now, bot.
$C: bad bot
$C: You're wrong, bot!  
$C: Bad bot.
$C: Bad bot.
$C: You'd have a point if that 70% had voted in the election.  Don't like the government, then vote them out.  To not even vote, but then call for a revolution seems like the height of stupidity.  
$C: Agree. 

However, the point still stands. The majority not "liking" an administration is not grounds to violently tear down the foundations of our nation. 

Electoral college buggery? Yeah. That might have warranted a response. But that's not what we're talking about now. 
$C: >I haven't like any of them.

You're not supposed to like them, they govern you. But you are supposed to ensure they follow the laws of the land. If, and only if, they break those laws and tear down the constitution is a revolution warranted. 

No representation might necessitate a response, and not having the voice of the people heard in 2000, 2016 could be grounds for extreme responses. But when the people and the votes choose their representatives, and you want to revolt, violently attack and rebel against them, that's not patriotism. That's treason. 
$C: The Revolutionary War was not waged under our Constitution, and our laws then - and since - have not included an "Overthrow What You Like in Case of Massive Corruption by One or more Government Parties/Officials" clause.

The framers of the Constitution wanted to specifically AVOID that possibility, hence all the checks and balances between Federal agencies and with state-level entities.
$C: Where in the Constitution do we have the right to overthrow our own government, please?

There is no suicide clause in the original or "living" adjustments to our Constitution.

I agree it would take more to be considered fully tyrannical, but not much, given Trump's massive wave of cultural division and associated upheaval he's generated+led.

Sure, we've lived through a horrible Gilded Age before.  Just never thought our children and their children would need to relive it all over again.  Nor to see it all be put into motion within a single year of Republicans controlling every federal branch.
$C: A quote, much older than me.  But I love it.

$C: Oh, I totally get the anger. It's definitely justified, Pai's a garbage person. I just don't share the bloodlust that seems prevelant in this thread. Imo, violence needs to be the ultimate last resort and I don't think we're there yet. I don't want people getting hurt or hurting others. I hope you're right and that all these calls for violence are empty and based on emotion, just people venting 
$C: You consider assassinating the chairman of the FCC a revolution?

Are you fucking kidding me?

And there's a vast difference between seceding to form your own nation and inciting a political assassination.
$C: Clearly a worse alternative, then.
$C: I dont think they will, no. That said, do you want regulation like this to flip every couple years? Over and over? Sign it into law, or keep the fuck away from it. I'd be happy if the government got the hell away from the internet. The only reason we even need title 2 right now is because of regulations at state and local levels that prop up these massive monopolies. Without the government being involved the internet would be far more prosperous and we wouldn't even need title 2. It's ridiculous isn't it? We need government intervention because of all the government intervention. 
$C: It's a sad day.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I think the over hype is a big problem. Because if nothing changes really drastically, then come election time no one will remember. 

Repealing NN has its problems, but unless the internet basically stops then it will look like everyone was wrong, and it was a good decision.

Plus, all the sites and ways that people are “contacting their representatives” by clicking a button to send a canned email or letter just make the representatives ignore their complaints. The same email over and over shows that the senders didn’t care enough to form their own opinion, and just wanted to feel like they were doing something.
$C: No worries mate. I think that a lot of the propaganda about needing to tack on $20 for this site, $19.99 for the social media package etc... Is unwarranted and not helping at all, at least I hope and expect that to be the case anyway, should NN be repealed. 
$C: https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/net-neutrality-violations-history/

Here are just a few examples of ISPs committing fuckery before Net Neutrality laws were strengthened. I agree that after hearing both sides of the story there is a few (let me be clear a very small amount in very VERY specific cases) arguments to be made for Net Neutrality to be repealed but for a vast majority of people Net Neutrality is beneficial.

To me your argument boils down to "companies who have near monopolies have never fucked over the public in pursuit of profits before regulations forced them to stop", which would be a laughable argument as history has proven to us countless times that without regulation, large corporations who have monopolies or exist in oligopolies fuck over the consumer for more money.
$C: Yes. Several companies got sued over blocking their competitors traffic. Thats why the rules were put in place.
$C: When it comes to basic human necessities I guess I am but I'm a registered independent and vote what I feel not the party I'm affiliated with and for the character of the candidate.

$C: that day will be a festive day on reddit
$C: We don’t vote on the FCC
$C: Republicans have cornered the market on crazy mass shooters, and Pai is a Republican, so that's not likely. 
$C: I know. Which is why the republicans that voted to repeal probably will be disliked by republican voters.
$C: Well, sad as it may be for something with international effects, I doubt they would listen to you either way as you aren't from the US.

That said, you could write about freedom of expression in arts and worries regarding implicit censorship, and the need for consistent and reliable electronic communication when dealing with many groups interconnected throughout the world.

It's all about phrasing.

$C: I think it'd be funny if all those letters instead went to his personal address.
$C: I agree. I'm surprised how many people are upvoting this psycho though. I don't like this vote as much as everyone else, but this guy just advocated for terrorism.
$C: I was referring specifically to those in power that support net neutrality, in which case the answer is guns.
$C: Yeah I've been pissed about this ever since I was talking to my roommate and we reached the conclusion our country isn't fucked because of either party, but because we only have two and that leads to every action being an atrocious dysfunctional compromise that just winds up fucking everyone over.

For example: the government started financial aid programs and now many people can afford to spend more to go to college. Many colleges just said "sweet, free money" and now tuition is stupefyingly high. Is the solution to take away government aid so colleges are forced to charge more reasonable prices, or is it to regulate the colleges so they charge a fair price and each graduating class doesn't find themselves in more debt than the last? Answer: either. Both solutions have the potential to effectively solve the problem, but neither party will tolerate the other's method. So instead we're stuck in the middle ground, getting fucked on one end by a donkey and on the other by an elephant.
$C: to the gulag with pai
$C: I'm definitely a fan of diversifying tactics 
$C: Username checks out.
$C: You sure got me! Sometime you need to give mercy to the merciless otherwise the world would be filled with Ajit Pais. 

Edit: Not being sarcastic, idk why the downvotes.
$C: it's not even that tho.  it's a textbook oligarchy. 
$C: And you act as if the two parties aren't entirely polarized on ever topic. No matter who was elected... people were going to have to put up with shit they disagree with(buyer's remorse). Even with the ones they voted for. The reality is... most people don't agree on every issue their respective party sides with. Most people have a few issues they agree on that the other party sides with and their own party doesn't. Why? Because of the extreme polarization of politics in this nation. Heaven forbid both parties take the same stance on an issue. Heaven forbid reasonable middle ground is met.
$C: > It's a representative ~~democracy~~ republic

It's just that it is formed by democratically elected officials.
$C: Not just elected in 2016, as a lot of these people have been in power for AGES (looking at you, Senator Feinstein).  Hell, A~~shit~~jit P~~ie~~ai has been in the FCC since Obama appointed him; Trump made him FCC Chair, then his term was up and when we could have gotten rid of him, a few of the Corporate Democrats (Manchin, Heitkamp, Donnelly, to name a few) voted with the Republicans to keep him in.  They're as much to blame for this happening, and we have to vote them out when they're up for reelection.  (Manchin faces a progressive next year in Paula Jean Swearingen, for example)
$C: Not that I'm a fan of Hillary but she did win the election by any sane metric. Not our fault the game is openly rigged.
$C: Stay off the weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed - Stephen A Smith
$C: I really despise what the Democratic party has become, but you're right that the only two Dems with a voice voted in solidarity with the people.  You're also right about the Obama administration's dutiful protection of NN.  I do worry, however, that anti-NN may become an issue of bi-partisan consensus in the near future.
$C: Don't forget, Ajit Pai was placed in the FCC by Obama 
$C: I think it was Mitchell O'Connell who recommended that to Trump.

Then, well, here we are.

Kinda pissed tbh
$C: No. You're just blind. 

If you honestly think democrats are good and republicans are evil then you're lost. Sorry. They're both bad and all do bad things. The problem is they mask their true intentions. 

But hey. Don't believe me. Hilary is a saint. Bill Clinton did wonders for the Black community. Amazing side to be a part of. 
$C: I'm not republican nor democrat nor a fan of trump nor Hilary. Lmao. Insults don't work. 

Thanks for commenting. Have a good day 
$C: They favor the rich constituents. Bankers and elite. Stop. Go read books
$C: > Well the whole fastlane argument is pretty much just fearmongering. You'd run into lawsuits and potential FTC rulings over anticompetitive practices while potentially losing customers

That shit already happened. There were dozens of cases, including Netflix paying comcast and At&T blocking competition to their services. That was why it got regulated under Obama in the first places.

https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-reaches-streaming-traffic-agreement-with-comcast/

>Title II fears have vastly slowed VOIP solutions

Obviously not, considering here VOIP providers are worried about NN being removed:

https://voipstudio.com/2017-net-neutrality-debate-affect-voip/

>You also have future services like remote surgeries which require fast high bandwidth connections that would violate net neutrality principals (because having the connection lag during a surgery could mean killing a patient).

That is why NN rules have exceptions for that. Literally a part of European NN rules.

>Many of these families are types where they have cell phone monthly plans that they can barely make payments on might find an internet plan they can afford. That's not a benefit?

So poor families don't watch Youtube? Where the heck do you get that idea? A Netflix subscription isn't expensive, but it's gonna be more prohibitive for poor families if Nflix needs to pay ISPs. Furthermore, there is no evidence connections will become cheaper, there is no competition for 80% of americans to get a pitiful 25mbit connection, no choice for other ISPs.

With the limited competition, it is completely uneconomic to lower prices.

>It's almost like government regulation is preventing competition.

Yeah, regulation can stiffle, but it can also support, so it's dishonest to make such a dogmatic statement. Or do you think anti-monopoly and anti-trust laws are stiffling competition as well?  

And all that dangerous regulation holding back ISP competition will still be in place, because they were already before Obamas reclassification under title 2 in 2014:

https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qkvn4x/the-21-laws-states-use-to-crush-broadband-competition

So title 2 won't actually fix any problems, just introduce new ones for online services.

>To say companies can now slow down or block consumer access on a whim is a complete lie. Doing so would violate the payment contracts their customers have made and pave the way forward for a large variety of lawsuits depending on how it's done.

No, they literally did it in the past without any problems, until Obama reclassified the web services:

https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-reaches-streaming-traffic-agreement-with-comcast/

So no, there is no violation with the common contracts.

>If you can't understand the side you are arguing against how can you ever hope to persuade someone?

Pot calling the cattle black, ain't it? Except worse, since all the arguments you brought are super easy to refute, with the minimal effort of a short google search, for example.
$C: Can we call this corruption?
$C: We’re really not though. We can’t control when our representatives decide they’re not going to listen to us and decide to act in their own selfish interests. We can’t control when a representative promised one thing during his campaign and does something completely different. 
$C: I did everything I could to prevent this from happening. I used my voice; I voted locally, in midterm elections, I voted in presidential primaries that were totally fucked, I wrote to news stations asking them to stop covering Donald Trump before he won the Republican primary, I canvassed for Hillary when my candidate Bernie suspiciously lost in the primaries, I voted in November last year against Trump, and now I am speaking out on individual issues that matter. I am a college student, I need to work to provide for myself and secure my financial future, I don't have time for this fucking bullshit. Don't fucking tell me that I let this happen, fuck. You.
$C: lol like you have complete control over your government. Get off your high horse
$C: Oh, and you have an iron grip on your government? By your logic, it's your fault we can even affect the whole world, because you, collectively, were too weak to build a strong nation to compete.
$C: Honestly, have you been paying attention to the outcry over this? Please don't act so condescending. We've done our part, and we've fought all this time to make things right, but there really and truly does come a point when our voices are outright ignored by those in power, and that's what's happening right now.

They've proved through their actions and words that they don't care what we say, so our only recourse now is to vote them out. It doesn't help that these same people are spreading misinformation to their supportive constituents, so most people against Net Neutrality don't actually understand what it's about. Don't lump all "Americans" into some big category of apathetic layabouts that have no interest in where this issue goes. The fact that this and so many other threads exist to show our support is proof of quite the opposite.

$C: It is the music of a people who will not be slaves again.
$C: > All that needs to happen is for a better form of democracy to be used, and for all the corruption to be driven out

Wow,is that ALL that needs to happen? All the revolutionaries just need to share your clearly articulate vision of democracy and all the people need to be not corrupt and then BAM: utopia!
$C: Well first off we aren't even a democracy, and also with such a hugely capital country, corruption isn't going anywhere.

Edit: Also I'm sure almost every country was founded on some sort of revolution.
$C: I’m agreeing with you...
$C: Well I'll believe that when I see it. Right now i see three Republican FCC members sticking it to the rest of us.
$C: The implied dichotomy presented (the inherently anti-net neutrality Right versus the inherently pro-net neutrality Left) is asinine. Political parties are not monolithic, nor do opposing parties overwhelmingly disagree on all issues.
$C: I see. Thanks.
$C: I don’t know - to me, this is a massive clusterfuck. If I just want HBO HD, I have to pay for the most expensive plan that includes everything? What the fuck are half of those channels anyway?

Actually, TV neutrality would be a great thing - every channel would be available to you for the same rate, and you would subscribe to individual channels if you wanted to access them. I would maybe actually use TV if it worked like that...

TV channels don’t link to each other, and they don’t depend on each other. People don’t use TV channels for anything else than watching them. That’s a huge difference compared to how the internet works.

If Youtube was rate limited, it would impact every website that embeds a Youtube video. If Facebook is not consistently available, neither is Facebook login.

The internet is own single big network, and there are many services you can’t just throttle or rate-limit without impacting many other services.
$C: Communism* Opportunity* 
$C: You can't just immigrate to canada. Canada is often just as nationalistic and prejudiced as the USA. You do not welcome all. You turn away anyone caught in our disgusting, racist, war on drugs or prison industrial complex, for example. There is also plenty of prejudice and exploitation in Canada, but just different. The internet sucks worse than in the USA and rent is too damn high. You can't get a job if you aren't a resident. They make immigration difficult just like we do.   
$C: I’m in MN, so it wouldn’t be that different...
$C: I'm in Montana, already used to it :) And we're definitely considering Canada. I actually have a degree in Japanese and Asian Studies so Japan is an option but my GF would struggle. She knows Chinese and is a business management graduate so she can kind of do anything anywhere and China is also an option but I would probably struggle there. That's why we were looking for an English speaking country if possible. I have read that Canada is somewhat difficult to emigrate to but we'll look into our options if net neutrality is actually repealed. Seems like such a daunting task but this is just getting ridiculous, can't deal with it much longer.
$C: No. It will definitely affect the internet as a whole but that doesn't mean that "many other countries" will do the same. The extreme lobbying in the US allows for things like these to happen there but it's not a universal thing.
$C: We would absolutely love to live in Finland, Sweden or Norway but I suppose I've always  thought these countries very difficult to get into. It's also a scary prospect to live in a country that speaks a language I don't know but I guess I've technically done that before and if enough people speak English, that would be just fine.

I'm definitely going to look into this, like I said I've always had the presumption that immigration to those countries is very difficult but maybe if I make some calls I might find out that it's easier than I imagined. Thanks for the suggestion, I've made some inquiries into Canada which appears surprisingly willing to accept people without a criminal background so maybe it's possible. We're definitely keeping our options open. I think we've always wanted to live abroad and all the crap going down here is really just pushing us toward what we've wanted to do anyway :)
$C: I get where you're coming from but comparing the two is a little off-base I would say. I don't subscribe to TV and I think a lot of people don't nowadays, their plans are overpriced and unnecessary with services like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon etc...which come under threat with the repeal of these rules. Cable is not something that people use to work from home, to start a new business, to engage in civic duty, to connect socially, to participate in the economy etc... These are very different things and in this day and age, the internet has become a requirement whereas cable definitely is not. It is not something that should be taken lightly.

Also, TV packages don't threaten and stifle innovation, startups will struggle, the internet can be legally censored and just the possibility of that should scare you as it sets a precedent for much more shifty activity. I'm not saying that these companies will do all of this, I understand that this isn't an apocalyptic situation (yet) but it leads us down a very dark path, one that I may not want to be a part of and have every right to be concerned about. Maybe things stay the same, I don't know, but companies are not known for being transparent and there could be very dire consequences for this decision, we just don't know yet. But I'm certainly going to be prepared for the worst case and hope for the best case. I'm not leaving this up to the moral conscience of telecoms, that's for sure.

Don't worry, this isn't a knee jerk reaction, it's something I've thought about over the last year or so if things get bad enough. I don't want to abandon ship either, I love it here, but things are going in a direction I don't agree with and I think I need to consider my options for my overall well being.
$C: Reddit is REALLY far left.
$C: Meh, their fiber network is less taxed, so they're a little less likely to mess with it. The indication is that Verizon was pushing for this rule change for the sake of their DSL networks and for Verizon-Wireless.

Verizon has always been able to raise prices at regular intervals, and they are pretty notorious for doing so. So I don't really expect that aspect to change.

This is gonna get stuck in courts for years, just like it did on the last two major cases on the matter; and hopefully, as with the last times, while those cases occur, the telecoms won't try to alter anything. But we'll see.
$C: When we shut it down, we setup our URL to redirect to battle for the net for a few days and then eventually shut the whole thing down completely.

$C: This is a bad attitude. While you don’t need to give money, you still should call your congresspeople and go vote! Even if you lose, you take away their support and it makes it harder for them to do things. Look at republicans like susan collins or bob corker who have been pushed to become more moderate due to pushback from their consistent. 
$C: Don't CNN and Fox pretty much always say the exact opposite of each other? I'm canadian and choose to watch neither of the above for the most part, but my impression is that fox basically dumps on everything Democrat and boosts anything Trump/Republican, while CNN is basically the reverse. My point being, if those are the 2 places one goes to for info, wouldn't it result in just being stuck going around in circles?

$C: Oh no I guess we tried way too hard. Ahh jeez if we just didn't "weponize" our political views, guys next time make sure to half ass it!
$C: Enjoy your life!
$C: Huh?
$C: That escalated quickly.
$C: RemindMe! 2 days "Did he actually leave reddit?"
$C: **FireChat**

FireChat is a proprietary mobile app, developed by Open Garden, which uses wireless mesh networking to enable smartphones to connect via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or Apple’s Multipeer Connectivity Framework without an internet connection by connecting peer-to-peer.

Though it was not designed with the purpose in mind, FireChat has been used as a communication tool in some civil protests.

$C: thanks for this. did not know this sub existed. definitely looking for resources on this topic right now.
$C: I admit that I don't know much about mesh networks yet, but this is good motivation to find out more.  I believe I am referring to the logical topology, as you say, but I am specifically thinking about the firechat example. there other examples I'm sure.

I'm also sure there are other possibilities besides mesh networks, but there is already groundwork for this. Overall, I just think it's more productive at this point to focus on what we can actually do, with our own efforts, without relying on corrupt politicians.
$C: what makes people use TOR now? or p2p file sharing? if isps push this and an alternative is available, then people will use the alternative. once the technology is mature enough, people will use it.  in the meantime, help these technologies grow, spread the word! 

I'm sure there are other possibilities. [project loon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Loon) comes to mind. it will take time for this to develop, but I am hopeful that it could actually result in a better internet overall.
$C: I actually just read about how GoTenna is being used to restore Internet to parts of [Puerto Rico](https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/14/a-mesh-network-spontaneously-erupts-in-the-us-and-helps-connect-puerto-rico/).  Very cool.
$C: I was reading earlier about the possibility of using crypto currency block chains for this, but I do not know enough about it to follow. can you eli5 or point to some resources, specifically about how a mesh network could operate like this?
$C: well shit, it looks like the firechat people are already working on something like this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opengarden.internet&hl=en
$C: Yeah, now we just have to worry about ISPs censoring things instead 
$C: The First Amendment protects us from government censorship. *Nothing* protects us from corporate censorship.
$C: that's absolutely true, he's got a business to run and keep running.

but at the bare minimum, it's helping keep it open, which is good for the rest of us right?
$C: You can makes this statement about anyone who runs a website in the united states. 
$C: That entire situation has been misrepresented so much that most people don't even know what actually happened.

1. A vitriolic user made the spurious accusation that /u/spez was a child molester.
2. /u/spez edited the comment in question, changing "child molester" to "very nice man," or some equivalent thereof. As you said, this was done in such a way as to make it clear that a change had been made.
3. Rather than establishing a dialogue (as had been the intention), this action whipped certain individuals into a frenzy, during which they made still further accusations and developed conspiracy theories.
4. As the situation drew more attention, people who didn't see the humor in it flipped out and claimed that /u/spez was going around altering opinions with which he didn't personally agree.
5. /u/spez openly apologized, not even trying to explain what had actually happened.
6. The conspiracy theories and wild misrepresentations remained.

It was the equivalent of having someone plaster a poster with your face on it around town – possibly with text that read "THIS MAN DIDDLES PENGUINS!" – and then you crossing out "DIDDLES PENGUINS" and writing "IS IN FAVOR OF GOOD THINGS!" in an entirely different color.

Quite honestly, I don't think I would have handled the situation with quite as much tact and poise... but unfortunately, both tact and poise are wasted on people who enjoy getting bent out of shape over having their bullshit called.
$C: yeah man, i know of the commenting editing and other stuff which there is no excuse for. but really though, look at the positive side of things that this guy has done. 

has he committed crimes against humanity? no. has he tried to use his influence and power and magnified voice for generally good things? yes.
$C: /r/conservative banned me because I posted that the republicans won't make a deficit neutral tax reform bill. This was before the bill came out. Both house and senate versions will increase the debt by at least 1 trillion. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
$C: I totally disagree with your opinion, personally. I *think* i get the reasoning - you presumably don't trust the government, or think they'd do a shit job. You're probably 50-100% right.

But here's the problem I have - are huge corporations with monopolies/oligopolies any more trustworthy/reliable? Is society better served by a small number of corporate leaders steering the Internet wherever they want? 

There isn't enough competition in the telecommunications industry for market forces to sort it out by letting the consumer choose the winner. There's only a small handful of enormous corporations, and now very little in place to stop them from steering the Internet wherever they want. Is that better than untrustworthy and/or incompetent government regulation? Not in my opinion.
$C: No need to rush him, and just wait patiently for your turn.

I'd like to see your evidence.

$C: Last time I checked T_D is still meming in all its unfettered glory.
$C: thanks, doing this
$C: It takes what you wrote into the text and creates a fax to send.

That was it avoids digital pathways. 


$C: I got responses back from my representatives when I used it. 
$C: It's an effective way to quickly contact your rep/senator within minutes of realizing that you want to contact them, instead of waiting until "later." 

Also, what are you implying should be done? 
$C: Writing a letter is the worst way to contact your reps/senators, as it takes some time to reach them, where a fax is instantaneous. 

Really, the most effective method is calling, as you speak directly to someone who writes down your concerns then passes it along to your rep/senator. 

SO calling, in conjunction with sending a fax in the same day is a good way to be sure someone hears you that day. 
$C: good lad
$C: Debatable

$C: The costs always end up falling on the consumer. Remember when airlines had to charge for luggage to make up for lost money because of fuel cost increase? They turned around to make record profits and continue to do so at the consumers expense. This is bigger than just some project by some admins. 
$C: I'm in India. TRAI ruled in favor of Net Neutrality.

You're free to use any service, nobody runs the Internet 

 That's why we need net neutrality 

You can use 4 chan.  You think 4 chan will be put into the basic Internet package? Hahaha 

There's almost no censorship on reddit, as proof that the Donald still exists, the only banned subs were ones that dox or incite violence

$C: He went to Canada.  After about 10 years there, he was allowed to become a Canadian citizen, and he said it bothered him that he had to pledge allegiance to the Queen to do so, but everyone told him it was just a custom, and didn't really mean anything.

$C: I agree that Pai is corrupt as fuck, but that's not a capital crime.
$C: Indeed. Just saying that the two both have flaws, but I'd prefer capitalism, simply because it's 'Work to Earn', and communism would make weaklings. Main issue of capitalism is deciding what jobs pay more.
$C: I don't even know what else is available here other than spectrum. Certainly not anything with any sort of decent speed. Everyone I know is on spectrum
$C: > Could we get gigabit speeds from wireless networks?

Can we do that NOW?

We can get gigabit speeds from WIRED networks I know.
$C: I'm not trying to make fun or anything, but you didn't actually answer my question. I asked specifically why you opposed Net neutrality. 

Sure you have legitimate concerns about other issues as you mentioned DNS operations. But that isn't the topic of discussion.

From what I gleaned you just don't think this will be an issue in 5-10 years then I ask you... What about in the mean time?

We have rules in place that help consumers now, maybe in the future they will be obtuse, but as of now they really do help consumers.

Many people (including ajit pai) like to say that this won't change anything and that companies will act in "good faith" however:
https://www.freepress.net/blog/2017/04/25/net-neutrality-violations-brief-history

Those companies did not act in good faith, what's to stop them now? I also had a video that explained net Neutrality lined up, but I don't believe I will need it with you as you seem to have a firm grasp on the situation.
$C: He literally did. It's *Statute* you numbskull. 
$C: Holy shit you're dense, aren't you?
$C: You have to remember: appointees to the FCC have to be approved by the Senate, which means it is a political appointment. You can’t just appoint whoever you’d like: you have to find someone that the Senate can agree to confirm. Obama’s choices reflect that political reality: chances are, if he’d been able to, he’d have appointed more ‘ideal’ candidates. The ones he actually appointed were the ones he could get confirmed by a **majority Republican Senate.**
$C: People are spelling it out for you, and you're just arguing past them. You *cannot* be this dense, and still be arguing in good faith.
$C: Were you born retarded?
$C: He didn't enshrine it into law. He took an existing law and claimed that it now suddenly applied to the internet. 
$C: Follow your own advice.  You could open up a movie theater with all that projection.
$C: He wasn't.
$C: How is net neutrality only supporting google, amazon, and facebook? Everybody benefits from net neutrality except for the ISPs.
$C: You're acting as if things have never, ever been "perverted" before, and like it will never be done in the future. Like, how very dare ideals of law and regulation evolve with society/technology when something becomes an important enough matter in daily life to possibly require this "perversion."
$C: Your philosophical argument collapses, when you recognize that Corporations aren't people 

The Infrastructure of the Internet was paid-for by the American tax-payer  

The Internet is maintained by a public Corporation owned by the U.S. Government

The only ones stealing a product or service, as you call it "violating the negative rights of the individual"...

They are robbing you blind, and its sickening

FUCK OFF. Having kids is a human being's right. THIS IS NOT UP FOR NEGOTIATION.

You are fundamentally retarded and should never breed for the lack of a part of your brain that values kids above politics. Kill your self, now.
$C: for anyone interested, look into mesh networks. they're already being used in places like China to bypass government filtering and in disaster areas where infrastructure has been damaged.  I was looking for some good sources and I found [this one ](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/02/24/activists-creating-decentralized-mesh-network-that-cant-be-blocked-filtered-or-silenced/), but I'm sure there are more. I also saw some articles about how crypto currency block chains could be used to circumvent throttling, but I don't know enough about that to say. if anyone knows of any mature projects in these areas, I would love to help out. 

My opinion, but the internet's roots are in defense and research. I'm sure defense will be fine, but a lot of institutions are turning to the cloud to aid with research. if those resources get throttled, there will be knowledge, and motivation, enough to build an alternative.  I am hopeful that the result will be a more robust and accessible network, it just may take some time.

$C: And the government has no power without us.

$C: But it is so fun to make them.
$C: Why does the alternative always have to be a pre-existing system and not an entirely newly created one? Why can't you guys ever think outside the box? It's retarded. You can easily take and leave aspects from each that are good/ bad. But don't worry I know what the answer is. "Thinking of a new one takes effort, and I don't want to put in effort."

Majority of the problems for centuries hasn't even been corporations or government, but a complete unwillingness by the populace to participate in their own lives. Everyone wants to pretend that by doing the bare minimum, they will eventually lead a life of luxury. If people want things to get better, they need to start putting in work and caring a little more about themselves. And not just telling themselves that they do, they need to be able to show it. 

We only got to this point by allowing it to happen. It's our fault, not theirs. It's time to stop self victimizing like a social justice warrior does.
$C: Works rather well in europe!
$C: a literal dictator?
$C: How about community self-organisation/governance, involving horizontal power structures, like is currently being implemented in Rojava, Syria.
$C: Real original take there fella.
$C: Eh, I mean examples of stateless and classless societies have actually been pretty internally successful before being crushed by imperialists, fascists and Leninists. See Catalunya in the Spanish Civil War, or Rojava in present-day Syria, which is horizontalist and communist of a sort, and has just kicked ISIS' ass.
$C: One could argue that America kind of swooped in to save the day, though. It traded supplies and arms with its allies, which isn't anything out of the ordinary. Don't get me wrong, it's better than staying home, but don't act like we were acting out of the goodness of our hearts.
$C: Lmao Libertarians are far from the modern GOP and you know it.
$C: "Private tyranny" is only possible due to government regulation though.
$C: > seeing how many American Millennials do everything in their power to sabotage their chances of living a meaningful life

Damn millennials and their avocado toast, amirite?
$C: lol low of living AND employment opportunities. Please list so I can follow. Those two do not go together. 
$C: Can you point me to these employment opportunities and low cost housing? Seriously, I'm tired of having sleep for dinner. 
$C: Pretty easy to make up your own narrative from the outside looking in. Shit's not great for a ton of people in America.
$C: Seems like every Canadian I interact with lately is a smug and condescending know-it-all but ultimately doesn't know wtf they are talking about
$C: I too can hate a single country with my reductionist views. Idiot
$C: > best employment opportunities

> low cost of living

> dozens of world-class cities to choose from

How any combination of these things combines in your head without causing some contradiction seriously confuses me. In a country as big as America, we'd be a pile of slag if we didn't have areas with low cost of living and areas of good employment opportunities. As you seem to be Canadian: I'm sure it's cheap to live way up in the North; is anyone going to hire you there?
$C: You'd be lucky to find a one bedroom apartment for like $1200 a month where I live. America literally fucking sucks, my guy. You don't live here, you don't know what it's like. Fuck off with your empty statements 
$C: what?
$C: Sure, when you don’t understand how basic things work and base your understanding of our country and it’s opportunities on a few online videos, I can see how you would get that impression. It would be nice if you to at least show our apparently ignorant citizens these supposed best employment opportunities in the world-class cities all while having a low cost of living. 
$C: Haha low cost of living *and* employment opportunities! You can have one or the other, but you can't have both in the land of the free. Hell a lot of people can't have either.
$C: Uhm, what. I'm an Aussie that just immigrated to Canada. You guys just let in a shit ton of people without much vetting while your native population goes hungry and jobless. Not sure how you can go about calling America 'pussies' on immigration policies. Your PM is an air head who thinks beating his chest about feminism will solve all the problems in Canada, lol. Never seen a bigger pussy in my life, and I'm a woman. 
$C: lets be honest i'm pretty sure USA and Canada both pretty equally suck

Canada does something right that USA is shit at, USA does something right that Canada is shit at, but in the end it's all just 2 big piles of poopy and gold flakes my pal
$C: Haha not many people who live here complain, we know our country is good, and we are immensely proud of it!
$C: Lol we force our immigration laws?  What are you smoking buddy.  There is no laws here anymore, we have a open border and letting anyone in.  And don't forget we are welcoming terrorists with open arms too.  
$C: lol low of living AND employment opportunities. Please list so I can follow. Those two do not go together. 
$C: lol low of living AND employment opportunities. Please list so I can follow. Those two do not go together. 
$C: lol low of living AND employment opportunities. Please list so I can follow. Those two do not go together. 
$C: Can’t believe it took a Canadian to make the only intelligent comment in here. Bravo.
$C: Yes there is. 
Do some research fam.
$C: It's not even January yet
$C: I'm from NY in the states so really Canada wouldn't be that great of a difference for me, but I loathe the cold here too honestly. I'd live in the South for the heat but won't for other more obvious reasons.
$C: I'm doing just fine, its my government that's getting me nowhere. 
$C: The government should not be able to jail people for saying words.  Who gets to decide what speech is hate speech?  What happens when the people in charge change, and suddenly the government has the arbitrary power to jail anyone saying something they don't like?

These policies are short sighted and infringe on free speech.  I'm genuinely shocked by the upvote-downvote ratio in this comment chain.  Downvote me all you want but this is ridiculous.  I was bullied in school...should my bullies go to jail?  Or was it not "real harassment" because I'm not trans, gay or some other protected class?

Free speech needs to stay free.  Once you give the government the power to throw you in jail for being mean to someone, bad things happen.  They should not have that authority.

Edit 1: And the comment is controversial!  Keep throwing away your rights in the name of "inclusion" everybody, let's see how far it gets us.

Edit 2: While we're here, why not talk about this "who doesn't deserve it"?  Are you saying it is OK to harass someone who *does* deserve it?  Who deserves it, and why?  Who gets to decide?  You?  The government?  What happens when you no longer agree with the government's assessment of who "deserves" to be harassed and who gets to be a protected class?  Do you not see that using language like "deserve" in this case fundamentally undermines the goal of equality?  If it's going to be illegal to be mean, shouldn't it be illegal to be mean to *anyone*?  Not just certain protected classes designated and enforced by a constantly-changing, democratically-elected governmental body?

There are so many sides to this issue guys.  We cannot just boil it down to "being mean to trans folks is bad so it should be illegal".  We have to consider the broader principles and long-term impacts of these decisions.  Otherwise we are just voluntarily signing away our freedoms to make us all feel better.  Freedom matters more than feelings, and our freedoms should be universal.
$C: Wow you people want to take away my rights!?!?! ^^^^^^to ^^^^^^shit ^^^^^^on ^^^^^^people?!?!?!

>the alternative to attempting to move

Isn't an alternative at all. Attempting to move isn't an option in the first place. 
$C: Costs weren't going up before ACA?
$C: You should check out the article I linked, they will explain it way better than I can and has helpful graphs and info graphics. From the article:

> In May, Trump asked that a major federal court case weighing the fate of the Obamacare cost-sharing subsidies be put on hold again, leaving billions of dollars in payments to insurers up in the air for 2017 and 2018.

Thus:

> Major insurers exit Obamacare exchanges amid uncertainty over whether the Trump administration will maintain subsidies that keep insurance costs down.


That then leads to rise of premiums and less options for coverage:
> According to data released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on Oct. 20, more than 1,560, or about 51.4 percent of U.S. counties, will only have one insurer in 2018. About 2.1 million exchange participants will not have a choice in insurer.

And now the average benchmark premium, "for a 40-year-old enrolled in the second-lowest cost silver plan," will actually rise in 2018 to more than twice the amount it has risen in total from 2014-2016.

But really, read the article. Reuters is a level headed source and has quality coverage with the stats to back it up. 



$C: > And refuse to fund subsidies which in turn have caused healthcare premiums to spike higher then any time under Obama. 

Read words
$C: He wasn't arguing with that part, just the part of your statement about "The only thing Trump has done with healthcare".

$C: You should fear the truth pal. Or just continue living in a fantasy world. 
$C: A purely Google-run internet would be a dystopian hellscape. The idea is to have an open internet. A privatized internet is the very thing we're fighting against. 
$C: Allowing companies to control the internet is exactly what we're trying to prevent.
$C: If your like half of all Americans with only 1 “choice” of broadband ISP... your internet is already in the hands of one person...the ceo that runs that company. At least if Elon fires up his satellite network you would then have 2 choices.
$C: Well for one thing England and France weren't democracies back then where things could be changed non-violently with votes. We fought against the Nazis because they invaded and took over other countries. These are hardly equivalent situations.
$C: > Oh, you mean the Congress with a higher percentage of Republicans? Yeah, they don't give a fuck.

They need to get re-elected every so often.  The fact that a D can win a seat in Alabama for the first time in decades says a lot.
$C: Because the government regulations are in place to stop companies from getting too big and powerful. Governments aren’t meant to profit but they do using backhanded methods, imagine what companies that openly admit that they want to profit do. In this case government regulation is the lesser of the two evils.
$C: but regulation is bad /u/feedthebaron
$C: Trump won the election, and now he has the power to do something different from what Obama did.

If we had a president who was pro-net neutrality, this wouldn't have happened.
$C: You can't "unbeat" someone, but you can undo a piece of legislation, policy, or ruling on something.
$C: Sovereignty is another matter entirely, but the internet is something that I think surpasses it. Consider the Geneva conventions - they don't really impact sovereignty, but most countries mostly abide by them. When they do not, people are often held accountable. Does that mean these countries have given up sovereignty? I argue no. The submission of a country to a global panel in the context of a global service doesn't impact sovereignty, either - at least not as far as this sort of thing is concerned.
$C: You're in one of the EU members with a far better reputation. Here in England, our government is potentially responsible for a significant number of human rights violations, our ISPs have warrant canaries, people are getting antsy and annoyed, and money is beginning to talk much more loudly. Here... I'd say it's very likely. If it happens here, then it'll spread across the channel. A few member states will say no, namely the nordic countries, Switzerland perhaps, likely Germany, but otherwise it's not unlikely at all.
$C: Sorry did I miss something? The left is planning a fucking revolution because they don't get their way and I'm insane?
$C: Liberals are the insane ones, calling for violent action and bomb threats because they cant critically think for 2 seconds and see that the Net neutrality laws didnt do **anything** to help fight ISP monopolies
$C: LOL

The rest of reddit is the containment area - we live on Reddit and in your minds **rent free**
$C: Nah I'll stay here, the rest of reddit can be a lot of fun when y'all are whipped up like this
$C: Nothing's going to change. It'll be ok.
$C: The internet is now a human right? Get your priorities straight
$C: Haha
$C: Obama can't fix the Republican party being shitty, sadly.
$C: Even if McConnell suggested someone else he would have still voted like Pai.

Notice the other two republicans on the panel voted with him. 
$C: I find it funny that you go around making claims of racism when it's not the issue here. How typical. Being a piece of shit has nothing to do with race, being white doesn't fix being a cunt.
$C: Actually I see no reference to cultural heritage.  Could you please show us in the sentence where the "badman" mentioned race? If so I will gladly be quiet
$C: [Here is a detailed post I wrote in another thread. I hope it answers your questions](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=cases+of+isp+throttling)
$C: [deleted]
$C: Republican
$C: No he hasn’t. He’s not doing anything for you, he’s helping corps. In a few years when the market bubble pops and your 401k drops, remember you said this. Your internet bill is going up while your access is about to decline. He is here to help corporations, not you. Open your eyes and stop worshiping the R. 
$C: haha, saw that reference yesterday with South Park.  
$C: Netflix, reddit, youtube, Amazon and other content providers are also corporations.

Here is a [timeline](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/20/14960154/netflix-net-neutrality-stances-timeline) explaining how Netflix's stance on NN is pretty clearly shaped by its business concerns rather than a sense of right or wrong.

One example is opposing zero-rating when they weren't a beneficiary of it, but supporting it when they were.

$C: You use more you pay more, you use less you pay less. Seems pretty straightforward, no?
$C: Wrong
$C: Honestly, if it wasn't him it'd just be another Republican and we'd be in the same boat.
$C: Honestly most of the stuff posted about net neutrality is hyperbole. The biggest argument that everone seems to push around here is ISPs dividing internet up into packages like cable packages. The current net neutrality laws never protected aginst that. This is the only relavent section on consumer protections in relation to the sites they access in the net neutrality act

>No Blocking.
Consumers who subscribe to a retailbroadband Internetaccess service must get what they have paid for—access to all (lawful) destinations on the Internet. This essential and well-accepted principle has long been a tenet of Commission policy, stretching back to its landmark decision in Carterfone ,which protected a customer’s right to connect a telephone to the monopoly telephone network .

If you notice, they say consumers "must get what they have paid for." This means that an ISP can't block you from accessing reddit completley. This does not prevent them from making you pay more to gain access to reddit. There is nothing in there that says ISPs cant charge site by site access. 

They model this section off of the same laws phone companies have to follow. Your phone company has to let you contact anyone connected to the cell network. However, they are still allowed to charge you more for calling certain people(for example, long distance calls). So cable companies can still charge more for certain websites.

They do mention that they cant charge content PROVIDERS(Reddit, Netflix, Google) more to prioritize their service. This is why NN has been shoved in the face of everone on this site. Reddit. Reddit is a fucking huge website, the 8th largest. They have more page views than instagram, twitter, netflix, and amazon. The reddit admins are fucking terrified, because now ISPs can charge them more becuase they use a shit ton of their bandwith. 

I agree with net neutrality, but reddit has decivingly framed it as a consumer protection law when it was mostly a coorperation protection law.
$C: Pretty sure it is. If it isn't, this guy is probably at Best Buy right now buying TB hard drives and heading back to his mom's basement while running red lights and stop signs.
$C: What? Go outside 
$C: You understand that doesn't make it a *good* thing, tho, right?
$C: minor typo. It was supposed to say laws against the repeal of net neutrality. No need to get up in arms about it
$C: Wait, is Russia shutting off their internet? I'm confused.
$C: A lot of companies are based on the US. And many communities have American majority (e.g Reddit). Many websites will die if ISPs get unlimited freedom.
$C: This comment is ironic in every way
$C: Obama and Trump both led Ajit Pai into his position of power. This goes beyond Republicans and Democrats, this is pure corruption. 
$C: It's the state of the world. A revolution is the only way to make actual change at this point. Voting is pointless.
$C: "But but but it wasn't our fault!" - American public after Trump was voted President.
$C: I voted for Obama, and then Hillary. I even voted for Kasich in the Republican primaries as damage control. I publicly voiced my support to my peers. I am fighting the problem.
$C: Haha you think we have a choice! it's an illusion man
$C: [deleted]
$C: Sure did. 
$C: Netflix actually owns its own hardware to help mitigate the problems its bandwidth usage causes. There are a few other companies that do this as well.

While OP is blowing it way out of proportion, it does have the potential to have rippling global effects. Some companies already have plans to increase their fees to offset the impact that it will have on their data, so that consumers won't have to buy into a package that includes that service for that service to get "fast lane" speed.

The big difference here is the idea of paying for bandwidth by content, by the consumer, which is the reason behind the push explicitly stated by Comcast and Verizon.

Some businesses will do what they can to absorb the cost for their users to retain them, and it won't be an overnight thing, but American telecom is kinda like Canadian telecom, a few players with a too much power who know they can abuse it.

If you could rapidly deploy a new network you own, rather than being an ISP that buys off of the ones that own one of the backbones (this is why Rogers, Bell, Verison, Comcast have such an impact in Canada, they own network backbones, R&B in Canuckistan, V&C in the US, and all other national level traffic goes through them at some point (as well as a large chunk of international traffic hosted outside the US, which is where problems will potentially arise outside the US)) you could topple the giants overnight.

--------------------------------------

They basically milk the population to the point I was thinking of fraudulantly getting a phone from some European company and paying for an international roaming plan, because it was actually cheaper than Canadian telecom at the time. I now have the best price vs what you get plan offered in recent history, because I went with Wind when they came in from Europe (literally the moment they had a single tower in my city), and were with them long enough to convince them to give me a grandfather plan from their early days, $35/mo and the only other thing I could ask for is global calling and roaming.
$C: I think America needs net neutrality because of companies like Verizon and Comcast. There's apparently 0 consumer protection in the US which means companies are basically free to fuck over the customer however they see fit.

Here in Australia there are at least checks and balances to someone mitigate that.
$C: According to some math I just did, you would need approximately one billion billion (that isn't a typo) floppy disks to back up the internet, as of spring 2016.
$C: You forgot the fascist apocalypse, that one's gaining traction amongst the mentally unstable.
$C: Everone on this website has the misconception that net neutrality protected you from your ISP deciding to make internet packages. This is the section in the net neutrality act that talks about consumers and what sites they can access.

>No Blocking. Consumers who subscribe to a retailbroadband Internetaccess service must get what they have paid for—access to all (lawful) destinations on the Internet. This essential and well-accepted principle has long been a tenet of Commission policy, stretching back to its landmark decision in Carterfone ,which protected a customer’s right to connect a telephone to the monopoly telephone network .

It says "must get what they have paid for". If your isp offers internet, but says you have to pay more for a streaming service package, then you havn't technically paid for that. 
$C: You realize net neutrality has been the law of the land since the internet became a widely used resource in the mid-90s? It was only effectively put on the books when companies started to exhibit unethical behavior in the face of what was established in principle. 
$C: No but that is the whole problem, they could just dump MSNBCs competitors and thats just as shitty.
$C: And that hurts Netflix, Spotify, and HBO, not the ones who need hurt, the ISPs
$C: No, it's **definitely** impractical to live without an internet connection, and not for "some", for **everyone**. Which is why the idea of organizing a boycott against it is laughable.
$C: I don't think I am.

I see this battle for the net (.COM) as a fight between backbone providers and ISPs on one side, and major content hosts and social media networks on the other.  In other words Cogent and Level 3 versus Google and Facebook.  Reddit, being a social media network, has weighed in on the side they see as being in their interest.

I think this issue is more than one of simple consumer protection, though I see consumer protection as an aspect of net neutrality.
$C: Peripherially, I'm skeptical of the hard sell.  
$C: >  I do understand that "net neutrality" is bigger than the slogan

I really appreciate that, by the way.  You've given me more credit than most.
$C: Privacy is not part of net neutrality?  Having been a supporter of organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation for a long time, I'm not sure I agree. 

Is the focus is now only on consumer protection w.r.t. teiring and peering agreements between backbone providers and content hosts? When did issues such as privacy and freedom of speech become unimportant to internet freedom?
$C: > It doesn't matter what you see NN as. My FeeFees are hurt.


$C: Is it not possible I have a different perspective?

I see reddit as posturing nobly about internet freedom, yet at the same time I also see them as acting less nobly. 

Keeping the net free (.COM) is only about rate limiting?  I don't buy it. 
$C: > This is about not letting ISPs fuck the consumer

The ISPs are not the only threat to the consumer. Major content hosts and social media networks also have the potential to do harm in a variety of ways.  For that matter, so do regulatory agencies within the government.  If we want to keep the net free (.COM) we should keep all of this in mind.
$C: Well, you've certainly elevated the discussion with this brilliant comment.
$C: Here's why I think the focus on backbones and ISPs misses something important.  Given the market power of companies like Facebook and Google, should they not also be held to some reasonable neutrality standard given that we are holding Level 3 and Verizon to some kind of standard?  
$C: According to you, a useless drone that accepts semantical differences while ignoring equal principles. Net Neutrality is a principle - if Reddit can't follow it, it can't demand others to follow it either. GFY.
$C: Are you really dumb enough to not understand the context?

- You downvoted and called someone an idiot without presenting a fact supported counter argument. Arbitrary semantics are insufficient.

- I am mocking people like you who insult or downvote without providing supported counter arguments. 

If you posted supported counter arguments without insults, you would be excluded from the group I am mocking. GG 
$C: Yo, is it alright if this shit is posted on T_D?
$C: He was promoted to chairman by Trump. Obama appointed him on the FCC because his seat was required to be held by a Republican.

Why don't you go play some video games? For a sec you might forget that you live in a shithole state and have no friends

$C: I didn't call anyone a racist. Are you a bot?
$C: Lol, do you always make baseless stupid comments?
$C: its childish and counterproductive. to default to violence proves your ideas weren't very good in the first place. what proof do you have of this claim? how do you measure progress? And doesn't the word stand usually get prefaced with the word final? 

I understand gun ownership for hunting or basic home defense, but the face that a dude can go and mow down 600 people and the country barley flinches is horrifying. human life really has no value does it? ethical laws, an informed and educated populous, and a sustainable lifestyle should be priority. Not lets go to the casino and gamble our savings away so we can win enough to build a bunker and make our own alcohol. (oh ya I also dont like casinos or booze). 

how about instead of increasing your ability to inflict deadly harm we work on increasing our ability to improve our health, our minds, our nations infrastructure, and the sustainability of all all of it. hell, just taking a second look at the water lines might help there be a few less sickly invalids. i guess theirs always soda. its got electrolytes.
$C: That's not how it works.


$C: No, that's not how it works. At least not for important sites. Sure, the  website of Plumber Frank could be slow as hell, but what do I care about him here in europe?

Any big website has already mirrors hosting the site in europe. 
Frankfurt is the biggest internetnode of the world.

Just name one website that I regularly visit, that would be affected.
$C: I bought the first one. Wasn't falling for *that* again. 
$C: Some sort of threat happened....Stopping the vote....
$C: He deserves worse than hell.
$C: Hewllit Packard could monopolize the web then.  The web will end up a big clusterfuck of fees with so many routers that that it will slow down to less than a crawl again.  
$C: Also you would need a way to get to a separate part of the web without traversing the rest.  Sounds dumb just you wait.
$C: So the vote isn’t as bad as everyone thought it would
Be?
$C: That’s on you. 
$C: Yes. I said this. And again, it was Trump who appointed him as president of the commission in January. There's a difference between being on the commission and being the president of it. 
$C: You're a Nazi War Criminal
$C: Damn right
$C: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
$C: oh look a nazi
$C: You're still implying that Obama had a choice in the matter.
$C: I totally get this sentiment, but like you said we aren't going to get there. What we can do is vote for the lesser of two evils and push like hell for that party to actually institute real change instead of the current mere continuation of the status quo, and "hey at least we're not the GOP" stance of many democrats.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Thanks for proving my point
$C: How much did the democrats receive from companies for Net Neutrality as opposed to against?  Also what was the voting order?  If it was a D before the chairman, they could have voted no just for publicity knowing that it would pass.

Republicans obviously received more from against.

Edit:You also have to account for "donation" history.  If I spend 10mill a year on a party for 5 years, and then a critical vote comes up so I send them an extra 20 mill with an implied threat that I will donate to the other party if they do not vote my way, and the other side sends an up front 50 million, this is 70mill>50mill so generally the party will vote my way.
$C: he is talking about senators and reps, in which dems did support repealing NN

$C: What?

Do you even know what Title II is or what the 1996 telecommunications act is or what a "common carrier" vs. a "common carried telecommunications service" is?


Do you not understand that you had a weak form of net neutrality up until recently, and now have lost it all because of the regulation of the internet under Title II (the same regulation that comcast operates ALREADY under for its cable?).


Are you this daft you don't know the heavy donations to the Democrat presidents and candidates to make this happen in collusion with the republicans?

And Obama nominates Pai that year.


Come on. get it together reddit. stop being so easily manipulated by a corporation. Congress didn't vote to repeal net neutrality (they tried with SOPA/PIPA etc and failed), the FCC did. And it's an executive branch power.

Do you folks not know how this works? And who controls the FCC and how our regulatory agencies operation and why it's essential to buy the whitehouse and congress?


Jesus. Easily mislead.

$C: Just something I've been curious about ever since the wave of "My representative sold us out for x dollars" posts. 
$C: You don't see it as an FCC fee. They just raise their rates, citing profitability concerns, which all regulated utilities can do under Title II, only a lawsuit gets them reviewed, and the FCC has SOLE authority in this matter unless the federal circuit courts overrule it.

Contrary to popular belief, the government can't stop a company from raising its prices to cover losses from lawsuits or fees paid to the government. What usually stops it is competition.



> I guess I'm just not seeing how an ISP that has already been caught red-handed throttling their competitor's service (Comcast, Verizon, etc) is somehow less motivated to throttle the shit out of everything and raise their fees for everything when LESS regulation is on the books when they still maintain the same market ubiquity.

You are correct. That's why you have to dump title II entirely. Right now it blocks folks from starting their own ISPs.

We need competition. And utility method of regulation that telecoms have enjoyed since 1934 (when it was just Ma Bell) has benefited them at the expense of the consumers.


It's time to go: no, now anyone can lay lines or use your lines and you can't cry about it. You can't sue municipalities under FCC protectionism law regarding regulatory compliance. You can't use 9-11 accessibility as a reason to stop a fiber start up , which offers no telephone, from laying lines in Denver Colorado because 'voip traffic might have 9-11 needs'.

These are all things that protect them, also the FCC recommends infrastructure investments: to date, they've received $400B of tax payer money. Who do you think that gets that? The small guys?



The FCC is a strong regulatory agency. It just uses that strength for the interests of the ones who have captured it. This is called regulatory capture - an entire article at wikipedia (even citing the FCC as an example): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture

You can't regulate your way out of this. First the protections have to be peeled back so some of the big dogs go bankrupt and smaller companies can compete. Then we can re-regulate, with many smaller voices.
$C: Right, democrats only think of people.

They would never, say, take advantage of a certain section of the population that votes for them 90% and ignore them, exploiting their minority status and relative poverty via workfare programs for votes?


Naww, they're SAINTS. Jesus. It's like "Democrats, 80% as shitty, but still better!".


No, you're the party of economic stupidity and 80% screwing me for my freedoms. The republicans are the party of half-assed economic stupidity and 100% screwing me of my civil freedoms.

You aren't 'better', and democrats often help republican donors achieve their plans through brazen dumbness. Dodd-Frank is the best example - literally screwed every small bank in the US.
$C: > Can you explain a bit about why deregulation is necessary for a government to survive?

When regulatory capture happens, the rules are being written by the industry they're supposed to regulate. Thus the regulation is pro-corporate. This often takes form in centralized, quick-decision making to benefit current corporate interests (as opposed to legislative, which is usually very slow and painful).


> I have heard that it was earlier regulation itself that put the ISPs in a position to throttle and thus require NN rules in the first place.

Yes and no. There was competing regulations, the FCC's executive rules and the legislature's 1996 telecommunications act. The regulation of the internet as a utility (instead of an information service) meant that only the FCC's applies, not the congressional act (this act was what SOPA/PIPA etc were trying to overturn if you recall).


> Does your statements mean that less regulations = less levers for corporate interests to pull?

Yes. Basically make the companies not able to buy anything for a short period.


> Do you mean that regulations need to change with the times, out with the old, in with the new?

Yes. You go through a short period of chaos, as the monopolies break down, and then institute newer, thinner law.

Overtime, it will get more crufted and contorted, until we return back where we're at, and rinse/repeat.

At least a healthy republic would do that.


Folks confuse (I think intentionally) that deregulation means = no regulation. Jimmy Carter was one of our biggest deregulators.

Thanks to him, you can fly better (the average plane ticket from JFK to LAX cost was over $1250 in 1971 dollars. 1971 DOLLARS) and craft beer because he *deregulated* those industries.

This allowed smaller airlines (southwest, for example) and beer makers (Sam Adams) to begin operations. Before hand it was either straight up illegal or so expensive to comply with the tilted regulations (on purpose by the companies who paid for them) that it was basically impossible.


I find many people who label themselves "progressive", aren't. They don't believe in government ownership of people or their rights, they don't believe in state monopolies or that a government is always good.

Often times, they're left-libertarians, who want more individualism and smaller companies competing, just with a thin, but strong, veneer of regulation to keep everything from going tits up and some services to help the unfortunate.

"It has nothing to do with republican or democrat." Good one!
$C: You’re fucking brainwashed. Shut up.
$C: It's a problem of having the government in the corporations pockets. Dems and Reps both do it, but if you think they're the same then you're sorely mistaken. Dems have repeatedly shown that the voice of the people matter and at least try to come off as a party that works for the people that vote for them. 

Plus you know. I'm a queer woman and it kinda matters to me that my very life could be hacked away just because the GOP says it should.

$C: Nah, lets do both at the same time, that way they dont have enough time to respond to the power vacuum of having their opposition demolished.
$C: People downvote because you're abrasive, but it's true. I considered running for office here in Texas for state legislature.. Until I found out they're paid a rate lower than minimum wage, assuming you do 8h/day of work over their session. Add on the cost of campaigning and it becomes something impossible for the majority of Americans.

It doesn't mean that they're *literally* the same and vote the same way on every topic. Obviously they'll have opposing agendas because they'll be getting paid off by rival competitors.
$C: So how is that one party is fighting for tax cuts that benefit the 1% and their donor friends? Why does one party seek to take millions off Medicare and Medicaid? Why does one party continuously talk about cutting social security and other programs that help people? To insist that both don’t give a shit about people can be easily debunked by looking at voting patterns between the two parties. 
$C: Thanks, fuck face
$C: Yeah, Hollywood is such a conservative haven.
$C: Gotta get dirty to get shit done. Recent elections have taught me moral high ground means shit 
$C: I don't know how you expect Reddit to be running completely for free, without any kind of advertiser appeal. Unlike most websites, we still have just one small ad per page, and mostly it's just a different subreddit.

Also, nobody really cares if you're just a republican unless you have actual extremist nazist points of view.

Also, please define "far left"? Can you show me at least one sub where liberals plan on doxxing, killing or harming anybody from the other side?
$C: Please tell me why conservatives are against net neutrality. Not looking to fight, genuinely curious what points you highlight. 
$C: Thats nice. You're still wrong. 
$C: >but equating being a republican with liking the vote is untrue and unfair.

It's really not at all. 

[Look at this list](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15100620/congress-fcc-isp-web-browsing-privacy-fire-sale) This is what happened when they voted on privacy. Notice all the Republicans and no democrats? That set the frame work for this. Also shows how much money they've recieved from the same people who want to gut Net Neutrality. 

Own it.  I know you're young but the party who helped do this and put the people in power to do this, are responsible. 

$C: Yeah, you posted the same thing under another account 2 minutes ago.
$C: Comcast blocking piracy traffic is hardly a basis to assume that they'll be blocking your social media sites unless you pay for a social media package.
$C: Wait, if NN started in 2015 what stopped Verizon in 2014?
$C: everything is the same and it's all terrible, when you're outraged enough
$C: yeah because the government fucked them over with telecom deals. That will change very fast. And I'd like you to show me at least 1 place in the US where there is LITERALLY one option for ISP. 
$C: > Both sides are corrupted as fuck, how they vote is irrelevant from that pov imo.

"In spite of the facts, I'm choosing to ignore them and choosing to believe a totally ignorant and false thing because it makes my apathy seem smart, even though it just fucked over an entire nation."

Yeah. You get 'em, guy. 
$C: > I see nothing wrong with Indefinite Military Detention Provisions.
> I didn't want Guantanamo closed.

You're a pretty fucking horrible person, you know that?
$C: Well it probably won't affect my country so yeah suck to be in America 
$C: so the vite still passed after all that happened?
$C: Good, thanks for clearing that up for me! 
$C: I wholeheartedly agree with you. Not voting is quite frankly, a disgrace, but it’s hard to argue with why people are so disenchanted. We’ve been lead to believe our whole lives that our voice matters, which I’m not sure is true anymore.
$C: These are both helpful explanations!  Thanks for your time!  :)
$C: What? I didn't edit anything you dumbfuck. And I didn't say anything about his skin. You guys need to settle down.

edit: Also when the fuck have I ever in my entire life said "poo" or "loo?" I'm not British you cuntblister.
$C: I'm not at all naive, but you are very naive. It is not controlled by, "like" 4 companies. Do a bit of homework. Don't just listen what some "Socialist" kid living in his parent's basement tells you. We have all kinds of regulation, which is how we get monsters like Google and Comcast. They can afford to deal with all of the annoying little fees and fines, and regulations, while the little companies can't. And you complain, but I bet you let Google intrude in your life in many ways. You probably sign every agreement Apple, Google, Microsoft, etc. without reading any of it. 

And I was talking about the things that have been around long before the internet, radio and television. Ask Howard Stern what his thoughts are on the FCC, or watch George Carlin talk about them. They are the most powerful media monopoly, and they have been oppressing and stifling free speech since their inception.
$C: All of those things would be illegal under net neutrality.
$C: It literally did though
$C: It's astounding the amount of mass hysterics revolving around this issue. 
$C: They aren't sending their best (They are)
$C: Nah homie, see citation in other post. Stop defending people who are literally okay will killing people.
$C: He isnt brain damaged. Hes scared because everything he believes in is crumbling around him, like the MAJORITY of americans. Its fucking scary man, don't belittle his feelings, hes allowed to have them. 

I do agree, that banning T_D would do nothing, however.

$C: That is hilarious. TD bans for even the slightest dissenting opinion, yet here you are on /r/politics

Edit: this is  not /r/politics. However, comparing banning policies from RD and /r/politics illustrates my point
$C: You serious right now?
$C: >  T_D doesnt demand ideological purity like you liberals do

You know you can check what comments have been deleted right?
$C: > hard to see opposing arguments when the only people that seem to disagree with it that I have seen are trump supporters
  
That's because you apparently get all your information and worldviews from the reddit echo-chamber.  If you had put even the least effort into finding out before jumping on the bandwagon, it would have been as easy as a google search.  You better do it quick tho, before Ajit Pai starts charging you 5 bux per search.

$C: I was against it before Trump was a political figure. I used to hate him essentially because he was mean to Ron Paul at CPAC once.
$C: **Net neutrality in the United States**

In the United States, net neutrality has been an issue of contention among network users and access providers since the 1990s. Until 2015, there were no clear legal protections requiring net neutrality. In 2015 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) classified broadband as a Title II communication service with providers being "common carriers", not "information providers". 

Throughout 2005 and 2006, corporations supporting both sides of the issue zealously lobbied Congress.

$C: >Yeah, I am sure because you are on the opposite side of an almost universally agreed concept that Net Neutrality is good

Argument ad populum.
$C: How you don't see the irony in your original comment or the reply is hilarious.
$C: Which ones? I remember there being a pedo-support group sub with a lot of members that really didn’t seem too interested in giving up their vice.
$C: No? It's not about the outcome. It's about an admin making a post about something that happened that had actually not happened yet.
$C: I’m Jewish. But alright. 

Racist liberals, hard at work, everyone!
$C: There's plenty of equally credible (if not *more* credible) sources that say *repealing* NN would stifle new competition, innovation and expression.

https://www.eff.org/issues/net-neutrality


$C: Cause they couldn’t?
$C: >None of these companies openly suppress one side of the political spectrum online, so that's fine with me.

Bingo. I really hope this hurts the bottom line of these tech bastards, and that they all have to take massive paycuts as a result and realise that the *'margins just aren't there anymore'*
$C: I copied and pasted form comments to my representatives, did you?  Also fuck those bots for generating a bunch of anti NN comments.
$C: I dont have leaders. I interact with others in online communities in a collective effort to get done what we (as whatever group) believe should get done. Im here because others here believe what I believe, not because I blindly believe what some fucking admin believes. for fucks sake.
$C: Have you ever tried to convince these people of *anything*? Forget convince, have you ever tried to have even a *good faith* discussion with them? Its impossible. All their points they insist are right but tell you to google it. And when you provide actual proof, they attack you AND the source for being obviously fake, ignoring any and all facts. Then half an hour later they delete every post they made and crawl back into their hyper-moderated safe space to pat each other on the backs about how they "owned those cuck libs."

Its a toxic communtiy that, as that post in r/minnesota proved yesterday, is slowly attacking the rest of the site. I don't know why those users weren't all culled a long time ago.
$C: bro ignoring your hate speech is me being a noble anti fascist. If we allow point of views we disagree with then they will all become national socialists and kill all the brown peepholes!
$C: Ah, that was good laugh. Thanks 
$C: I'm asking if you have anything to back up this claim you're making.  If you want, you can go ahead and explain how repealing net neutrality and allowing your ISP to decide who sees what for how much makes your concern any better.
$C: That's an individual subreddit's rule, not the whole website, and if you look at that subreddit's reason for maintaining a domain whitelist it's perfectly reasonable. 
$C: More like T_D having a complete misunderstanding of what "censorship" means. Which clearly includes you. 
$C: Wow, is that what I said? Or are you make believing? 
$C: It’s okay. You’ll get that coal job any day now. 
$C: You threatened to skin him alive.  It is clear you have been severely brainwashed and radicalized.  Expect a visit.
$C: the word cuck is such an immediate giveaway as to who is commenting
$C: Here's a post now from their NN thread:

>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

>EAT A BAG OF DICKS YOU COMMUNIST DIPSHITS!
$C: oh no wouldn't want to set a precedent of banning subs that break Reddit's rules literally every day
$C: LOL damn what a moron he is. I'm not sure who would read that and be like "yeah, great idea."
$C: it is okay for reddit and google to censor dissent but not for ISPs because muh Obama utility!
$C: There's this thing called "principles" which you're ignoring. Reddit loves to be pedantic when it means they get to be right. 
$C: Neat. I still did not mention Net Neutrality. I can not help how you decide to interpret my message. I thought my language to be rather clear. 
$C: Yea, Fuck me right?
$C: Aaaand joke ruined
$C: Join the right side, kek wills it🐸👌
$C: Delivered like a champ. 
$C: Neither is being a brain dead drone, following corporate propaganda.

Why do you think a billion dollar company (Reddit) was shilling so hard for this?
$C: Nope i live in lower bama and in la and also in fla and southern hospitality is a thing sure, if your wgite and rednecked. If your diff or have other values or beliefs or anything thats not christian.  Ya done. Oh and dnt try to talk about it cause you guys ways are law.  Ive lived the south life, and its shit and so are all the closet racist to scared to say how they really feel.
$C: Yea but its way more accepted and common place in the south.  
$C: I hate it cause ive lived in both and the rednecks are far worse than the libs 
$C: Lolololol like Id listen to uhhhh FASCISTS XDDDDDD 
$C: I have no hatred towards you or your region (thats kind of a lie, I do harbor resentment towards the unequal power rural states hold, but I can look past it and not be an ass to a fellow human being)

Southern stats are much more rural than elsewhere, and have lower populations. Yet, despite this, due to how we decided how many reps a state gets in the house (and the ratio of population to senator) Rural states have flat out more power in our government.

A seperate problem is that rural communities have objectively worse education.

Add those two together, and there is a powerful group of uneducated salt lickers running our country. 

To clarify, Im not talking about YOU, if you thought of someone and though "thats bullshit, my uncle bob is smart and kind" then you're right, Im not talking about your uncle bob.
$C: Your kind almost elected a pedophile.
$C: You take more from the country than you give and whine about it fucking constantly. 
$C: And thats the argument you have to contribute?   Yup you just won. Good job
$C: By Law, Obama was required to put another republican on the panel, and Ajit Pai was nominated by McConnell.  Rest assured, Obama had no real say in the matter. 
$C: Yea and the 3 who voted switched sides for a republican pay day.  You're blind.
$C: Your blind if u dont see what is right in front of you dude.  Sick of these backwoods idiots who think that of they see it on the internet its right.  Funny how cletus is all of a sudden an expert on internet relations when he found facebook in 2014 lmfaoooo.
$C: Wow and you're the reason we will never have it.  Seems to work in all other of the great nations on planet earth but not here cause i dont mind paying taxes for a pountless wall but ill be damned if they wanna take out an extra 10 out my paycheck so that a broken leg at the er doesnt cost me 5 grand cause it is outa pocket cause the part of the leg you broke isnt covered by your top of the line insurance so now it costs you 5 grand.  The logic you spew is so broke 
$C: I totally agree with u.  I was on break soeed typing lol
$C: Lol it won't effect anything. Title II regulation only existed for three years. The Internet existed just fine before... This was an attempt at increasing government control by the people whose political ideology borderline on straight up communism.
$C: True. 

Enjoy spending $300 a month for slow internet. 
$C: That is a valid point, but the question is how much will customers put up with? And will implementing frustrating changes like blocking VPN actually result in net positive profits? I don't honestly think so at all. If and when ISPs decide to take advantage of this repeal, they will get negative media coverage and boycotts/cancellations. That's stuff that most companies want to avoid. I would hope the majority of people wouldn't pay an ISP extra for certain things online. Nearly everyone agrees that such an idea is preposterous and disgusting.

Overall, I don't personally think that the government necessarily needs to regulate free markets even if competition is scarce in some areas. The principle remains that ISPs paid for and earned the ability to sell internet access to consumers in a free market. Shouldn't they be able to control their service how they want? No one is forced to pay for a service that's bullshit. If service is bullshit, someone can call that out and the company will suffer. There is always room for a good competitor to creep into a market and give people what they want, even if there are growing pains along the way/shitty choices.

$C: Привет. Я русский бот. Теперь я выхожу из вас. Да, я в настоящее время проживаю в стране, известной как Австралия.
$C: Why don't you answer that yourself. Which big company are you okay with censoring people? 
$C: No you can fuck right off
$C: What's even worse is the power that America holds over the entire Western world, if it's good for the goose, it's good for the gander etc. and the UK is America's bitch, I can guarantee that wee will do this halfway through 2018 and it will go through simply because of how many old retards there are on this sorry excuse for an island, it's how brexit happened, America did something crazy and out of this world, so the UK has to do something even crazier! So now, the NHS is under funded, the police is understaffed and tax rates will fly through the roof, but it doesn't affect the old people on their pensions, and they are the majority, it's shite please can I join you if the repeal doesn't happen?
$C: I'm specificly referencing the application layer because I'm conserned that government regulation by the FCC can lead to controlling what is allowed over those pipes, IE The Fairness Doctrine.
$C: Completely incapableof responding to the merits of the issue I see. 
$C: Oh my god, he lost the internet points. He’s so fuckeddddd. /s
$C: Showed his ass B) GET THE TRUMP SUPPORTER!!!@@#$#$ WE FOUND A TRUMP SUPPORTER OVER HERE!!!!! FUCK HIM UP BOIS HE DISAGREES WITH US! 
$C: You think outing him as a TD poster means anything? Well add me to your silly little list too.
$C: [lol](http://i.imgs.fyi/img/1qu5.png)
$C: Fucking stab him because he disagrees with you 
$C: Still not my highest Karma sub. 
$C: Quick someone give this detective his badge  
$C: [deleted]
$C: Trump supporter here to. Before you say something racist, im swedish asian.
$C: I posted there yesterday. When should I expect the firing squad?

How the fuck do you think calling people out for the subs theyve been to is helpful? If anything, seeing someone posted in T_D is all the more reason to try to make a valid heartfelt response to them. Hating them is what caused fucking everything in 2017 trump wise. So, good job.

$C: Well you and I both hang out on imgoingtohellforthis so maybe we aren't so far off.
$C: the_Donald is a 24/7 Trump rally.

Go to /AskTrumpSupporters/, or /AskThe_Donald/ if you want to be critical in good faith.

$C: the_Donald is a 24/7 Trump rally. 

Go to /AskTrumpSupporters/, or /AskThe_Donald/ if you want to be critical in good faith.

It's that easy.
$C: No they’re not. It’s 2018, Trump has been elected with a republican congress and we’re *still* having this conversation given all they’ve done, said, supported, and are still trying to do?

Just stop. I don’t know if you’re a Russian troll or if you’re an American who’s seriously stupid enough to still believe this, but either way, no one is taking this bullshit seriously any more. 
$C: Don't bother... Getting through to their tiny brains is like trying to tunnel through Mt. Everest. 
$C: >working for a gay jewish guy makes you a nazi

oh, reddit, you never let me down.
$C: Can you point me to [the comment(s)](https://i.imgur.com/WuwtV6n.png) where he's *incessantly* called a paedophile? 
$C: I'm not sure we're on the same page about what an opinion is
$C: >Again, that's not what NN means

Tell that to /u/spez, you doofus
$C: I don't get why NN drones think restating "that's not what NN means" over and over again is a believable response to legitimate criticism of it.
$C: Really? Do YOU have a basic understanding of the subject?

Have you read the 2015 regulation? Have you read the repeal? I bet not. If you had, you would have seen that ISPs are NOT allowed to throttle or block websites under the new regulations. But, you quite clearly haven't, as you keep fear mongering and spreading lies. Maybe you should get a "basic understanding" before deciding you are a telecommunications regulatory expert.
$C: He did it many times, and halfassed "apologized"

Get over it 
$C: Yea it's just insane to call someone out on being completely wrong on a subject. How fucking dense are you people? 
$C: Oh, I don't mind. I love when people downvote straight up facts that go against their narrative, it cracks my shit up, it's hilarious

Not to mention, the upvote/downvote system is a great example of how no one really wants "neutrality". Some content SHOULD get higher priority. Every downvote they give me is just more proof, without them realizing it
$C: Lack of net neutrality effectively allows censorship and it's one of the biggest talking points brought up by people.

Judging by the recent behavior of Reddit staff it looks like they're just taking popular positions while doing nothing​ of value about it, much like the rest of reddit and their bullshit spamming

You think reddit can't do anything to influence officials? Reddit and the rest of the big social media companies are effectively propaganda platforms for certain political parties and advertisement platforms for companies, you think they can't use that power as leverage?
$C: >looking through people's posts when you don't have any argument


$C: Yup
$C: Doesnt your mouth get sandy with your head buried that deep?
$C: No, /u/spez said it was first amendment, not me

Try to read a little slower next time 
$C: /u/PopeADopePope pointed out that reddit has an extensive history of censoring its user base for unnecessary, often political reasons, and your response was "that's not what NN means". So why should we support NN if it doesn't address any of the problems that we care about? How is spez not a hypocritical piece of shit?
$C: Swing and a miss, lad
$C: Sure. But the places these things are discussed, ie r/news, r/politics and r/t_d are not communities. They are hyper-polarized echo chambers that give redditors a false sense of confidence in their worldview. 
$C: That’s a real phenomenon I bet. 

The hive looks at a dissenting opinion with -150 votes and they feel like they accomplished something . It’s ridiculous.  
$C: The only answer is to do what makes you feel right. In my case, as much as I love reddit, love the fact that I can download any game I want to my phone, and watch mostly anything I want to thru various streaming devices, I'm going to give it up. I'm going to give it up because along with my entertainment, they are taking away my ability to communicate and be communicated with on an unbiased level. There will be no way to replicate that once they gut the internet. 

Let me break it down this way: Everyday I make a lunch to bring to school. Everyday a bully successfully takes my lunch away. The school (government) is so big and vast that they don't care about me, because I'm a salty peasant. The bully has taken my lunch everyday for six months. Yet everyday I make that lunch, knowing that he will take it. I could make two lunches everyday and hide one. But this is real life, so we have to face the fact that if I do that, my parents will have to pay DOUBLE for my lunches for no goddamn reason. (this is what they want. they want you to make two sandwhiches.) My choices are to have my family pay more, or stop making the lunch and go hungry. I can eat before and after work. (utilize libraries and wifi hotspots +added benefit of bringing business to your location) So I choose to stop eating lunch at school. I mean lets face it, I haven't eaten lunch at school in six months (been paying out the ass for decent bandwidth for years while they throttle our usage) So why bother making lunch in the morning at all? Now my bully has nothing left to steal. 

Hope that helps someone. 


$C: ... do you work for the FCC? or Verizon?  

Generally only businesses get fiesty when people demand better and don't just accept what's already been 'given'. lmao
$C: Fucking kill yourself racist scum.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Stop buying into this propaganda if you don't live in America this has 0 effect and you and will never have any effect on you ISPS can already put costs on websites yet they refuse because people would just switch do you think somehow that will become a problem with a more open market you know more options???? 
$C: You just made a huge point why Net Neutrality should be repealed buddy ( not for it but changes need to be made too much government control )
$C: Yeah that's true. I expected it to be gone cause greedy rich guys. Just sucks that the day actually came. 
$C: Who edited my comments?!
$C: thanks for admitting that NN is just excess regulation


$C: Yes, that dude it's so discounting
$C: how do you know that? not disagreeing but this is the first time i hear of that
$C: Good god, get over yourself lmao
$C: That's not even an appropriate response.
$C: That's one senator. Repealing the 2nd amendment has never been in the Democrat party platform. Other Democrat senators own guns.
$C: Fuck off moron, title II is not the same as Net Neutrality.  Do your homework and dick riding Verizon.
$C: >I wasn't speaking of NN specifically

This is a net neutrality thread. You were basically bringing up unrelated untrue strawman to dance around the fact that when it comes to internet freedom conservatives tend to adopt anti-internet policy, and Democrats tend to adopt pro-internet policy.
$C: Ok.
$C: Your point is rights, but what if we're able to profit more from the billing of advertisers that it works out for everyone, because it seems likely to me. Now the way I look at it is we should have a sort of half way net neutrality that allows equal access for private assets of the internet but also gives proveledge to providers to allow charging corporate sponsors on sites and media. So is personal rights more important in this case scenario? Or should we look at what could perhaps profit most. It's a tough question, I think we can find a compromise in the middle that will make most people happy

$C: True
$C: Lol, how single are you boy?
$C: Which will be replaced by Democrats. ROLF.

A democrat will be an Alabama senator for the first time since before you were born. 😍😍😍😍
$C: > If reddit were truly supportive of a neutral internet they would present both sides of the argument equally.

No, that's not how NN works.
$C: Well that's not in the spirit of NN! You see, our opinions didn't get our broadcast license renewed this year. The government denied my application.
$C: is that what you honestly thing the anti-nn arguments are?  Is that a real point of view?
$C: Regardless of your view on NN

It is indisputable that there was a pro net neutrality propoganda campaign on reddit and throughout the internet.

Propoganda has a certain connotation but the truth is that its a tactic, not simply something that is false.

Thats why its kind of hypocritical to say that all opponents of NN were swayed by propoganda, especially considering there was no comparable propoganda campaign against NN. Its a seriously low level form of thought. 
$C: Except the current Obama regulations didn't prevent them from doing that anyways? Geez it's almost like you've been lied to. Why don't you go find out what the regulations actually say, and I don't mean reading a Reddit thread. It's been proven /u/spez sold several subreddits so why not do your own reading?

[Here](http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db1122/DOC-347927A1.pdf) is a link to the actual regulation.

And I know it's wikipedia, but I am too lazy to find the court document: If you look under Holding -> Blocking you will see the court already cancelled that.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications_Inc._v._FCC_(2014)#Holding

Just please, start doing your own research and don't blindly listen to what /u/spez tells you. He lets other men have sex with his wife.
$C: Doesn't actually address the other persons comment.

Go back and address their comment.

You won't because it'll shatter yours.
$C: I don't get the hate for Comcast.  I've had their service for close to a decade now and have nothing but great things to say about them.  
$C: I seriously doubt they used the term "we're allowed to fuck you in the ass."... Especially right now, with all the sexual misconduct allegations popping up
$C: Sure, I'm just saying this isn't some kind of organized attack. Just normal users who saw the post and your comment... You are trying to delegitimatize the people who disagree with you, which I'm fine with (It doesn't change my life for you to delude yourself) - but won't help you in the long run.
$C: If upvotes mattered we wouldn't have Trump as President and Net Neutrality wouldn't have been repealed.  You can have your upvotes, I'll enjoy winning.
$C: You got tricked by propaganda. Pretty simple.
$C: disagreement downvotes are the way of reddit...  I personally try not to but you are blind if you don't see that reddit is the absolute gamification of thoughtpolicing...
$C: Lel ok guy.

$C: No, I'd be against it regardless of who passed it.
$C: Pretty much.  My tax dollars shouldn't go toward providing people with internet access.  It's not a necessity. 
$C: I'm fine with that scenario, but the unrestricted market will ensure that doesn't happen.

I'm far more concerned about the government having control.

This paperwork costs around $800 in legal and filing fees in addition to two weeks' labor costs for the person doing the paperwork.

Small ISPs would benefit from less regulation. They could come in and offer better services than a big ISP that is throttling data. Expecting a small ISP and Comcast to burden the same regulation does not foster innovation, it kills it. 

People are competent enough to at least try and not get screwed over. People who want regulation just don't believe in the average American citizen, they think they are too stupid to help themselves. Let small ISPs actually try and offer competitive services. 
$C: Most end users will never even be able to tell the difference once NN goes away.  Hell, I'd challenge anyone reading this to point out exactly how the internet improved in 2015 when NN went into effect.

>But if they threaten to slow the speeds of netflix unless netflix pays them some absurd amount of money

Which, honestly, they should be able to do. 
$C: The fact that you're denying that Russia has a vested interest in United States internal affairs is ridiculous. They're one of our main competitors on the global scale. We care about what's going on in Russia and if we saw an oportunity to compromise their stability with essentially a get out of jail free card we would do it in a heartbeat. This is how the geo-political game is played, and we're down quite a bit right now.
$C: I don't disagree with you, but your grammar makes me sad.

>Yes because Russia gives a single shit if the USA has net neutrality. "[I] just lost a bet, 'Fucking Russian trolls.' Girlfriend dumped me, 'Fucking Putin!' I got fired, 'Russian trolls at it again...' Oh I didn't win the lottery, 'Must be Russia!'."

$C: I thought you said you needed the internet for your job?

$C: Net neutrality is overwhelmingly anti-consumer. The costs which Reddit, Netflix, Twitter, etc should be paying for their high service bandwidth are instead passed on to you in higher cable bills. You are subsidizing them and they want you to keep doing so.
$C: Guy fire bombing means burn down the infrastructure not mass murder Jeeze lol
$C: Yes...they were. Sigh...you need to think for yourself. They were resolved by the market and customers calling them out. These problems were eliminated BEFORE net neutrality came to play. That's not to say more could pop up, but things always worked out before.
$C: No it doesn’t, you can say that but it not true.

$C: It's also a symbol of "I'd rather spend my money on something entirely pointless than your game's awful business model"
$C: Yeah, I'll just grab the cheques and upload them for you.

It's circumstantial. That poster on 4chan had a lot of info nobody else had, pictures and personal details of people working for ShareBlue, people working behind the scenes, documents, names nobody had heard before but then looked up and found connections.

If a lot of what he's posting seems to be legit - then there's a possibility this claim is too no?

So you look. What evidence is there that could lend credence to this claim?
The mod list was wiped and taken over by new names over 2 years ago. Hmmmm. Redditors noticing a change in the sub over a period of a few weeks after ShareBlue was announced. Hmmm. Now the sub blatantly being an anti-Trump pro-Hillary echo chamber. Hmmmm.

There is no solid proof - but something certainly seems to have happened with the mods and sub around 2 years ago, weeks after ShareBlue went live. Maybe all the original mods suddenly decided they would all quit in unison and it's just coincidence that all the ones that stepped up to fill the new mod team were anti-Trump / pro-Hillary.

$C: There is not a shred of evidence. Show me some proof.
$C: He asked for an explanation of what OP was referring to, I gave him that. No bias included and with a heavy dose of skepticism. 
$C: Even 4chan itself at least used to say that everything there is a lie.
$C: So you don't believe any news articles whose sources are anonynous, I take it? A lot like most accusatory Trump articles?
$C: There was another comment higher up that had this info but it seems to have vanished. 
$C: I wouldn't call it a pizzagate.....Far from it, tbh. As said in my OP, it could 100% be a LARP.

I distinctly remember when Reddit was completely pissed that *Correct the Record* was a PAC set up to astroturf places like Reddit in support of HRC, now, it's like a forgotten thing....when in reality, we all still should be pissed. 
$C: I bet you believe the democrats' Russia conspiracy theories as fact, without the slightest shred of evidence.
$C: I could cite a steaming pile of shit as a source and it would have more credibility than 4chan.
$C: Lol, like 6 or 7 comments asked for it, and I hate it when people copy/paste to every single comment so I thought I was doing people a favor and got obliterated for it....Yeesh, -140. Nice!

$C: I'm fairly liberal, and context matters. He absolutely was dismissive of the guys opinion just for being on T_D. Which frankly I don't find unreasonable, but we shouldn't pretend he isn't being down voted so much for anything else. 
$C: Weren't T_D users caught brigading too local subreddits as well? They're doing it here too. I don't know how anyone can take them seriously.

Education has been shit for long before Trump. Common core math is absolute bullshit, as is no child left behind. Changes had to be made. And the net wasn't neutral for a long time. That said, not a single issue voter. And the TPP would have been much worse.

Awesome. Now let's see some actual evidence.
$C: No. And if you believe a random guy on 4chan without proof you are dumb as fuck. Simple as that.
$C: How about proof of shills on Reddit, and that there's a real possibility that r/politics has been compromised?

How about that Reddit allows censorship?

$C: None
$C: > Where is the proof on this that isn't from James O'Keefe or infowars?

ACKSHULLY, it's from a 4chan thread.  Even better.
$C: I love how the narrative is pro-trumpers are Russian bots when Hillary [sold Uranium to Russia](http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/358339-uranium-one-deal-led-to-some-exports-to-europe-memos-show) and [paid them for the fake dossier on le drumpfff](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/nov/24/fusion-gps-russian-dossier-firm-paid-journalists-w/).

When you want to know what a leftist is up to, just see what they are accusing you of.
$C: Oh no. 10 minutes! The horror!
$C: I have the 10 minute ban on every sub. Im on Steven Crouders side with this one. Reddit will have to be more transparent to its users if Net Neutrality were repealed. If Reddit wants to claim to ISPs that it is an open platform, then it'll have to prove it to them, which they won't be able to do because you know they have bias hard coded into this website.  
$C: Revoking net neutrality isn't going to change anything in that regard, in fact, it is going to make it *easier* for powerful groups to have their way. Instead of having to manipulate the content distributors like facebook, reddit or twitter, they can now just pay the ISP's to restrict traffic to sites they find bad. 

The manipulation of social media of course is going to continue, in fact, we are still at the beginning of that development. Without laws and proper regulation to stop this, the internet will become a place of disinformation, extremely fractured into various echo chambers fighting for control.
$C: Relevant username and account age.
$C: Yeap, The_Donald does that. But it’s still fun to watch that crazy sandbox, nonetheless.
$C: >That would certainly explain mods seeming complicit with the pro-establishment narrative that is being pushed there. Anything criticizing the DNC or Hillary (even if it comes from people on the left) is downvoted into oblivion.

You were not there during the election then


>That and we're called delusional and conspiracy theorist for believing the sub is compromised, be it mods and or bots and shills.

Because you are. Proof is nobody of you ever post on neutralpolitics, you avoid the place because rules dictates you have to sustain your arguments with sources, and you fuckwits know you have nothing to support your shit. Ever. 

$C: You will also get 10-20 replies all at once. Like your post was flagged and then a group of individuals/bots all targeted it at once. Its...suspicious.
$C: The only "source" they have is a 4chan thread.
$C: Whatever you say there kiddo. 
$C: Okey dokey! 
$C: That's because reasonable people are often in the middle of the comment chain. Tbh i sort by controversial just for trumpies salt

$C: actually we go to work in between our cuck triggering. 
$C: >Reddit life

Wtf lmao do you think the rest of us don’t work?
$C: You are mistaken actually. Trump the individual has not filed bankruptcy. Words mean things. 
$C: Trump has never gone bankrupt, a few of his hundreds of companies have................... but if you type more periods you look less retarded....................................... amirite
$C: I think some of his various businesses went bankrupt, but not him personally.

Something like 60% of small businesses fail within the first two years, but 60% of Americans aren't personally bankrupt. So it's not really a big deal if your business goes bankrupt - you just close it down, and that's the end of that story.

But if you go personally bankrupt, you'll have a LOT of trouble getting any financing for projects you might want to undertake in the future.

A large business going bankrupt might just be the result of a small scale or temporarh financial mismanagement. A large businessman going bankrupt is indicative of a much more serious financial problem.
$C: You seem like you're a bit retarded, so I'll try to dumb this down. Businesses that Trump had a significant share in or controlled filed for Chapter 11 on 4 occasions.

And I didn't say Trump the individual, someone else did, but it's because the corporation not the individual was the legal entity that filed Chapter 11.

I'm not sure what your point is? Would the incompetent crooks at the DNC *not* have filed for Chapter 11 protection in these cases, then eventually being forced into a Chapter 7 and possibly being jailed for fraud or trading while insolvent? Probably, if the way they managed their disaster of a campaign in 2016 is any indication lol.
$C: Back up now.  The T_D brigade can only last so long.
$C: Even if it's just a screenshot from /pol/, I'd be interested in seeing it. Even a broken clock is right once a day.
$C: So you haven't any proof of that payment?
$C: Well, no. The_safespace is a hillary sub since they are obsessed with her, politics just gathers articles about politics, and guess what, if trump wasn't shit there would be more pro trump articles.
$C: Shake a little harder for me, you might make sense. 
$C: Appeals to reason obviously don't work on you haha
$C: youre i competition with jeff dunham sir.
$C: Not sure how i threatened mass violence. I just said i wouldnt be surprised if someone ended up being murdered because people will be pissed off about net neutrality being taken away.
$C: You're being deceitful.

The claim repeated many times was that ISPs were "STEALING THE INTERNET"

You have turned this into an extremely vague "abuse this power". 

To quote myself, since you alter the statements after the fact: 

**Not to mention, Obama made far stronger comments in the direction of taking guns away, than ISPs have made in favor of taking the internet away or "stealing the internet".**
$C: People have claimed nobody is stupid enough to take statements like that as fact.

You disprove them.
$C: Are you aware, that at the time our Founders decided to revolt, Colonial Americans had the highest average standard of living in the world and paid an average of 1.5% in taxes?  They would already have revolted.

$C: Lol. This isnt one of your video games, son. Or is that what you're talking about? You don't want people on the left on your little video game team?
$C: We got a badass over here 
$C: If you support the GOP, you support those things.

Period.
$C: We are getting to a point where it's going to come down to violence and you only have yourself to blame for poking and proding.
$C: This really isn't a partisan issue.
$C: Clearly you've never heard of the paradox of tolerance by Karl popper, or know the history of 1930s Germany.

$C: [deleted]
$C: I'd be ok with it.  I spend 2/3 to 3/4 of the year in Europe, where shit like this isn't an issue.  If Americans have to pay extra for reddit because the admins enabled a bunch of racist halfwits, so be it.  Maybe that will make them see the error of their ways.

At this point, I'm just at a loss.  Americans keep voting against their own best interests.  I keep voting too, but I'm starting to miss the point.
$C: I didn't threaten anyone, it's not illegal to hope you facist retard
$C: I know that. I'm just making fun of the idiots
$C: They want to grant ISPs power to block and throttle content, thereby imposing gatekeepers and undermining the free and open internet. What this whole thread is about.
$C: Where did I mention empathy? I'm saying that if you beleive no one would fuck him you don't understand how babies are made. 
$C: Tell me how it tastes? Im curious as too how clean his shits are.
$C: I'm afraid it's a lot longer than that. Most of these back-alley deals occurred under the Clinton administration and were finalized under Bush. As much as we hate to admit it, the sins of our past are finally beginning to catch up with us...
$C: Do they have vote bots and everything too?

Not just a troll, I expect this is a paid poster.
$C: Lol, I'm very likely older than you... and never had a trust fund.

I've been self employed for about two decades... owning a successful business I built from the ground up.

Your imagination is great tho.  
$C: Apes are not monkeys. Most monkeys have tails.
$C: Money is not the only reason the FCC made the decision. They don’t make that money. This allows for competition and innovation. The government always hinders innovation.
$C: You just proved my point for me... Goddamn.
$C: ... that's why I'm asking. I don't know?
$C: "Pai was designated chairman of the FCC by President Donald Trump in January 2017 for a five-year term." Literally five seconds on Wikipedia you fucking moron
$C: So... I have a couple of issues with your comment, and I will go over them one by one. 

(1.)"The only problem is that the free market has proven time and again that it is prone to crashes and fluctuations."

- I would say that a true free market has never actually been seen. We have seen a decrease in government intervention when it comes to specific sectors of a market, but I would argue that as long as the business model of a company with in this sector does not rely on a unsustainable resource (say oil for example) then it would be very rare to see an entire market crash. 

(2.) "If you deregulate the internet you risk destabilizing a tool that has become increasingly important and will only grow in importance over the coming decades."

- I agree that internet is extremely important, and this is why I believe that by allowing competitors into the market we will see better prices/quality of internet, forcing companies like Comcast to innovate. This produces a total increase in the quality of the product. 

- I also fail to see how allowing the government to control the internet in order to increase the "stability" of the market is better than increasing the quality of the market's product and decreasing it's price.


So, in conclusion, I think the concept of the market surrounding ISP's completely crashing is unrealistic unless the entirety of the internet's infrastructure was destroyed. Sure, one company could go out of business because of it's shitty product, but that would just allow its competitors to seize its share of the market.
$C: Correct
$C: Just because it's obvious doesn't necessarily mean it's a simple topic - the entirety of Internet laws in general is a complex mess, but you can read my response to warclannubs for an idea. Don't feel like repeating myself. 
$C: You wanna guess why there are a lack of providers ? I bet it rhymes with government.
$C: Net neutrality doesnt change the fact that the big companies can buy whoever they want. At all. Same with the price thing. The lack of neutrality is good for the smaller providers as it makes them have an easier time growing with less setbacks from regulations.
$C: I do know what I'm talking about. Your rage and toxicity prove to me that you haven't even considered the other side of the argument and have only focused about the negatives and refused to look at the benefits of both ways. If we keep the corporate world in check and hold them accountable, then win. You gotta chill out my man.
$C: 11 now... /u/spez, I thought you don't negotiate with terrorists.
$C: Yeah fuck that dirty terrorist George Washington. 
$C: Yeah that's what the statistics show that the majority of uneducated voters vote Dem.. oh wait no it's the other way around.
$C: Calling me names certainly won't help. 
$C: But still owned by them, asshole.
$C: The government doesn't give us rights... Most amendments are there to keep them from taking our rights, they don't grant us any rights though. 
$C: Freedom of speech is very relevant. These social media websites are effectively monopolies, so if one wants to complain about verizon and comcast, you might need a reminder that facebook, twitter, and reddit are monopolies too. They're just more censoring monopolies.
$C: Dude, you're talking to a former /r/coontown mod.

EDIT: oh, he already told you, nevermind
$C: So then verizon and comcast can censor instead (they haven't in the past, and probably won't, but that's the freakout, right?). So what?
$C: I'm getting censored by the people who are for net neutrality, so why not?
$C: And I think verizon and comcast should be able to do the same.
$C: Why do I get the impression you'd take issue with a certain bakery rejecting a certain clientele.
$C: >The Internet is a utility. It's not the same thing as using Reddit, and unless you are purposefully squinting, it's very clear.

And you are billed for how much electricity you use and how much water you use - which are both utilities.

So if you say the internet is a utility, you are saying you should be billed based on how much internet you use! HOORAY! YOU GET WHY no-NN is good!
$C: I'm not reading your giant rant kiddo, take it somewhere else
$C: Yep. I'm not calling for his death, just saying I'd be nice if those second amendment folks did something. Anyway it's too late now. They voted. We lost.


$C: Yep. I'm not calling for his death, just saying I'd be nice if those second amendment folks did something. Anyway it's too late now. They voted. We lost.


$C: u/RealLyreJ just told me to kill myself in another post as well. Sounds like a real gem of a human being.
$C: Bernie was a meme candidate and nothing more. No substance. 
$C: sounds like my idiot bro friends last year saying "after 4 years of trump we'll get bernie in a landslide!" some people can't wait and gamble like that. of course none of my friends were those people, they had trustfunds and six figure incomes and could afford to be entitled.
$C: > Your anger is severely misplaced. Bernie spoke to a great deal of people who wanted real change.

Yet many of his voters voted for Trump, voted third party, or stayed home, which ended up electing Trump.  Bernie's brocialist revolution is dead, you can move to Venezuela to see how socialism is working for them, but go ahead and deal with a shitty internet for the next 4-8 years because you're waiting for the next socialist revolution that will never happen.
$C: "I'm" not the Donald. I browse through the Donald every day. It's mostly news and current event information updated constantly. That's why there are new posts and comments constantly. People are dedicated and passionate on that sub and they work hard to get information out. They don't need bots.
$C: nah you're just uneducated as fuck lol
$C: Thanks, glad to see someone actually wanting to have a conversation. I assumed most people would disregard my comment as soon as they see I'm anti neutrality. Anyway, when I say 'break up monopolies,' I don't mean that the government is going to split up some major ISPs, its just that decreasing regulation will allow for smaller ISP companies to form. If we start to see slow and blocked internet (highly unlikely, most likely nothing happens), start ups will form and explode due to demand. I'm the past it was difficult to form an internet company because the government classified them as 'Type 2 Public Utilities.' 
$C: I am a consumer of Reddit because Reddit makes money from my usage of their website. Technically, I am paying them by consuming their ads
$C: > I'm not reading a crazy conspiracy site.

And there you have it. You dismiss the argument before you even hear it. 

>“It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.” -Aristotle

Let me ask you this smart guy... How can you expect us on the right to even consider YOUR thoughts and views and ideas when you wont even give our thoughts and views the time of day?

And therein lies the problem. I educate myself on both sides, even if i disagree. Why? So I know what I am talking about. 

Im done here. 

Good Day!!
$C: What's wrong with Jews?
$C: wait so its not on because liberals find it annoying that  something that  isn't part of their agenda is on the main page of reddit but you're for free internet yet you support censorship nice 
$C: Haha you’re admitting there is censorship. Good job! The anti trump posts are annoying but they are allowed. I wonder why that is...
$C: the root problem is that there isn't enough competition. that problem stems from the government giving ISPs sweetheart deals to establish infrastructure that created defacto monopolies (this is called fucking with the free market). now the solution being put forth is "more government". That's one way to go about it, but I think it will end with a worse product for you and me. I think the ACTUAL solution is harder but better. The ISPs have freely talked about engaging in anti-competitive practices. Antitrust laws need to be exercised to break the oligopolies up. The problem with the title 2 regulation is that comcast, verizon, time warner, they can all pay to bypass those regulations. know who can't? a small ISP. get rid of the regulation like the fcc did, but follow it up with action to disempower the oligopolies and open the market up for someone to PLEASE COME AND GIVE ME A FUCKING ALTERNATIVE TO COMCAST BECAUSE I FUCKING HATE THEM.


Edit: we want the same thing, better, freer internet. the difference is in approach. one side is saying "throw government at it" the other side is saying next to nothing (which enrages me to no end) or are only proposing half of the solution

$C: Wow that's sufficient reason to change the fccs decision
$C: If I hit a hollow surface it might
$C: That won't happen 
$C: That's good

$C: You know different states make different averages right? It's called the standard of living
$C: Explain. Go on, sell me Net Neutrality without resorting to googlin' it or buzzwords.
$C: lmao no no its not

$C: if there are no monopolies you will have faster speeds because of competition

that same competition is what will ensure you dont have to pay premium for steam

remember when ATT and sprint had a monopoly on cell phones? There were no more unlimited deals, you had to pay piecemeal for data

then t-mobile came in ,, offered unlimited for cheap now all servioces have unlimited access-

If your ISP wants to charge you premium for certain services, this is only a problem in a monopoly- because a smaller ISP can open up and offer you an open internet and they will get all the business- Tha magic of the free market

beside no isp did or will charge premium for specific site access

$C: Boy your stupid. Go put words in someone elses mouth, and then be some annoying fuck to that person.
$C: Net neutrality does not remain. It is repealed. The provisions that stop ISPs from throttling favoring content are gone. 
$C: Do you know what quotation marks around a word means in this context?

There's a difference between saying

> when did the left start...

and

> when did the "left" start...

I agree that someone can have views that are generally regarded as "left wing" and also views that are generally regarded as "right wing" - which is the very reason I put "" around the word 'left'. Get it now?
$C: My company pays for my internet.
$C: Brother, you should know that net neutrality is one of many tools by the white supremacists (liberals and conservatives) to freely float their propaganda unchecked.
$C: nobody cares fag.
$C: also, the FTC is back into play now. and that is why the major corps were pushing back on this. ANTI-TRUST LAWS NOW BACK IN ACTION. they are all fucked.
$C: You're literally just shilling based off that stupid image that's supposed to scare everyone.  Consumer protection laws are a thing, competition is a thing, keeping a board of investors pleased is a thing, if you think companies are going to hold services hostage because you have an infantile view of 'evil' corporations then you should honestly just reassess your viewpoint.  If literally even one of those things happens a any point I'll tip my hat, but they haven't, and won't.
$C: I think it's pretty obvious, no? Who would willingly enjoy paying more for internet? Context clues...
$C: Your funding backer soros is a nazi. You get paid by a nazi lmao
$C: >Yep will totally be the same, never you mind the massive pay wall that will stop access to sites via intensive throttling. 

Can you provide one example of this happening before the rules were put in place in 2015? Just one. If you can't provide that then this is a solution for a problem that doesn't exist. 
$C: I know what Reddit thinks it is.  They think it's giving equal access to each site and treating each site the same.

What that means is Google pays the exact same as someone who takes up 1/1000th of their bandwidth. Subsidizing costs to users, not companies that use the bandwidth.
$C: [deleted]
$C: > When you change your diet and lifestyle, of course your brain chemistry is going to follow.

Exactly, it changed so much that this "imbalance" in my brain chemistry balanced itself. There are thousands of people who has had their ADHD "magically" cured by doing the same thing as I did.
$C: precisely what this does. improve competition. i'm a small ISP owner and have been for many years. believe me when i say NN has been nothing but extreme federal overreach and a red tape disaster. 
$C: absolutely aware. i guess you don't work for a small ISP or know an owner of a small ISP. this repeal will help them expand. greatly. and offer faster, more reliable internet. and the opportunity for growth and investment will be unleashed. 
$C: yes. and it's nothing like you think it is. lol
$C: i'm a small ISP owner bud. i live this. you read about it. 
$C: Zito Media. google it.
$C: repealing FCC's heavy handed rules will increase competition. today is a wonderful today. 
$C: ...yes...and the title II change was implemented by the Telecommunication Act in the 30's. it is completely outdated. you're telling me you want the Internet regulated by 1930's regulations? lol
$C: Should have considered more things at the beginning of that career path. The world existed before the internet. It will be fine if you take some time away go outside and let your providers know you aren't happy with their services. It's called a boycott. Works wonders when applied properly.
$C: Because they have to meet demands for more than a commercial market. If enough of their home users boycotted their services throughout the country they would feel it in their pockets. And be forced to bend the knee to the demands of the market. And if other smaller service providers see this they will see a path to establish themselves in new markets. Its far easier to enter a market when their are customers actively seeking alternatives. Regulations do not stop monopolies. Otherwise NBC/Universal/Comcast, ATT, Time Warner/CNN/Yahoo, Google/youtube, Verizon would have been broken up years ago. They infiltrate the Public sector and write regulations that benefit their friends. Crony Capitalism.
$C: If you don't like Comcast, switch to Verizon...?

If you don't like cellular, innovate new ways to connect to the internet? Mesh networks, satellite?

We don't live in the final state of economy. Things change and improve and innovate. There are more ways to fix our problems than attempting to seize ownership of the status quo.

One way we will hold back progress is to mandate that only one entity is allowed to administer or oversee administration of goods and services. Rationing doesn't lead to improvement.
$C: Jesus fucking christ man, are you being serious right now?

Do you not understand how people might not support a cause on the basis of who's asking for help? This is not a difficult concept to master.

Since you clearly fucking need the ELI5 version, here we go:



Let's say your mom made 10 cookies, and decided your older brother got to determine who got how many. 

And out of those 10 cookies, he ate 9 and gave you 1. Now your brother needs your help convincing mom to give you both 10 more cookies. He's made no promise that he won't just eat 9 cookies again.

You both like cookies(internet). Why in the fucking fuck should you help him when he fucked you over just because he could? Maybe, just maybe, if he'd of given you 5, or 4, or even 3 cookies... you could of been motivated. But not only did he not do that, he doesn't even think what he's doing is wrong. But according to you: It's not wrong because it's not a law that he has to share, regardless of the inevitable consequences.

That's why conservatives don't give a flying fuck about this.

That's what I'm talking about you fucking mongoloid.


$C: Wait how did you seen this message to me? Isn't the internet dead? I thought millions would die from tax reform!
$C: How is giving The Donald access to the front page a free pass? If they have the engagement an subscription count, then they deserve it. The fact that Reddit had to rework their algorithm to discriminate against them is shameful and immature. 
$C: No sir I feel you may be a Retard 
$C: maybe i am tho :P
$C: Yeah, based off your comment and post history that’s a whole lot of projection. Stay salty 
$C: Not sure what this has to do with Trump, but okay.
$C: I was technically correct the first time, but just not specific as to which appointment I was referring.  However, I’ll keep that level of specificity in mind for future reference.
$C: Lets do just that!

>In 2011, Pai was then nominated for a **Republican Party** position on the Federal Communications Commission by President Barack Obama at the recommendation of Minority leader **Mitch McConnell**. He was confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate on May 7, 2012, and was sworn in on May 14, 2012, for a term that concluded on June 30, 2016.[1] Then Pai was designated chairman of the FCC by President Donald Trump in January 2017 for a five-year term.[16] He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate for the additional five-year term on October 2, 2017.[6]

So he was the person the Republican party wanted on the FCC, in a position reserved specifically for the Republican Party, and then Trump made him the head of the FCC?

Sounds like there's exactly one group to blame.
$C: Actually you can. Don't earn it in the first place, tax shelter it, or leave the jurisdiction.

$C: It's speculation in the sense that, since it didn't come to fruition, we will never know. Yes, Hillary Clinton occasionally speaks out against repealing net neutrality these days. And no, I don't have reason to believe that she would have specifically fought to repeal it, but who knows. Hillary Clinton is about as bought as a democrat can possibly be. My point isn't that Hillary would have done this. My point is that she didn't cater to her own party when we asked for answers related to the campaign points mentioned in my previous post. As one of my favorite political comedians puts it, she's the only candidate in history who wasn't expected to actually garner votes. You just somehow owed her your vote out of fear for Trump. Consider how easy this election should have been for her. It should have been the easiest in history, and Bernie would have rolled Trump, or at least every poll pointed that way. But corrupt money in the DNC insured that we didn't get a progressive presidential nominee. We got her, despite Bernie being a wildly more popular politician. And that's why she lost. She was Republican Lite. Your fight is with corruption in politics and with the Republican bigwigs, not with the green party. I know it's a shitty day, but punching left isn't the answer.

edit: clarity.... again
$C: Oh yeah?  So what now?  SOPA and PIPA failed because they didn't have their evil demon in place that they needed to slay.  They got NN through on an executive order, and now it is going bye bye like it should.

You morons on Reddit have been proclaiming the end of the world on today, 12/14/17.  When it doesn't end, are you going to realize you were wrong?  Of course not.

When literally NOTHING bad happens and the internet only get faster and better, are we going to hear from you morons again trying to get the government to take over the internet?  Of course we will.

Your propaganda was a nice touch.  It was beautifully executed.  Luckily Ajit Pai is not a fucking idiot.
$C: Since the Dems aren't in charge, they don't get any of that sweet money, so as you can see, they're taking the "high road". If Hillary was in power, the Dems would be doing this under the guise of making the Internet a safe space, and the Republicans would be countering it, citing "freedom".

$C: SURPRISE!!  Dems vote for government to take over another industry.  Shocker!
$C: Well I guess it all depends on everyone's perspective. Eastern Europe's right wing parties don't advocate for more social programs, Russia's doesn't, Israel's doesn't, everyone else is either Western Europe, Australia, or 2nd/3rd world countries/dictatorships.
$C: You

I don't care if you want to ruin your net

Also you

REEEEEEE people will rape and kill if you don't give them 10mbps

No wonder you have so many Africans raping and committing terrorism in your country  in your country since you think to prevent crime you have to reward them.

$C: Youre totally wrong. If YT for example started charging you think people will just accept it? I wont ill use the next best free service. Do you think YT will risk losing its market share to turn a few bucks? Econ 101?

I dont live in the US i just pay attention to the facts and not the obvious propaganda issued by alphabet, conde nast et al.

You are all being used as puppets to protect the profit margins of multinational web companies.

Just watch, dont take my word for it when we can let reality prove me right. Set a reminder for 12 months. If the internet has become the dystopian nightmare reddit lied about then i am a blithering idiot and ill delete my account. If not you may want to rethink your world view and think more carefully about championing the causes of your corporate overlords.
$C: Because trump saved us from “killery”. He’s spent his entire time in office so far removing people who don’t follow his “orders”, and the masses are some how surprised everything is going to shit in a hand bag. Only the tip of the ice berg. If you don’t own a business you better get on it. Corporatism is the future. Should be interesting to see how these next 3 years play out.
$C: The US has never been for the people, it has always been about preserving the control that the rich and powerful want. The revolutionary war wasn't undertaken to help the common person, it was so the elites could ganner more power. Almost every war, political action, piece of legislation, major political decision, and governmental structure has been designed with this intention, either explicitly or implicitly. In the context of US history, the only thing surprising about the FCC vote today is that it took them this long to defeat net neutrality. 

I am slowly beginning to think that the only way the US gets better in the long run is if we revolutionarily redesign the entire thing (fyi, not making that statement to condone violence).
$C: >You’re right. Why the fuck are we allowing this? 

Bread and circus. Same thing happened during the Roman Empire. 
$C: If this comes to sweden im joining some sort of "antifa" LIKE group tbh.
$C: Without representation? 

Yeah, that was kind of established before.

Pai in no way represents the people.
$C: What's the difference if you don't provide a clear report of what the tax money is used for to the people paying?

What's the difference between a mafia and a government if the guy elected isn't the guy people voted for, and the taxes you're paying are spent in ways that aren't disclosed? Is it that the money is spent for the best of every citizen and if so, why not enforcing the trust of people in publishing open reports about it?

Yes, I am convinced that taxes are theft at least partially, and government didn't gave me any reason to think otherwise. Such a corrupted structure need to gain my trust, it's not granted, and there is no effort made to gain such trust, quite the opposite actually.

A good taxation system doesn't need to be enforced, it should be open, transparent and voluntary. 
$C: Just doing my part to fight capitalism.
$C: The internet is simply another medium through which free and open discussion and public speech take place. In fact, today, it is *the single greatest and most important medium*. Having such platforms is absolutely essential in a democracy, especially one where all other forms have been similarly taken over and abused by those with power and money, which is exactly what is now happening with the internet.  
   
No, it is not classified a public utility, but it *should* be. That is the fucking point. Don't just step in with stupid one liners designed to showcase your ignorance on a subject. 
$C: the MSM isn't a civil liberty, but journalism is.  An attack on journalists is an attack on civil liberties.

This is an attack on the method of communication that almost every single human being uses.  Imagine, as a liberal, if HuffingtonPost was blocked as "anti-state propaganda" or, as a conservative, Brietbart?  Imagine as a freedom loving individual Infowars being blocked?  I think Alex Jones, and his lawyer agrees with me, is an actor paid by sponsors to get views and does so by inventing bullshit stories; but I don't think his website should be blocked or banned simply because he did a hit piece on Verizon. 
$C: Open, unimpeded access to publicly available information isn’t a civil liberty?
$C: Don't bring facts here!
$C: Last words of stabbed man: "What are you gonna do? Stab me?"
$C: Go look at his wikipedia, did you even bother to do this?
$C: Oh don't you worry, I have no problem with it
$C: Lol open political discussion. Name one place that occurs on reddit. Twitter scrubs vast amounts of trending topics that don’t fit the left narrative and label links to factual information as dangerous (wikileaks). Facebook is also doing its “fake news” thing and banning accounts of vocal right activists. You can be okay with that, but don’t pretend there is any sort of neutrality in how they police their websites. 
$C: It shows that I replied to user azerbajani.
$C: I think it’s actually referring to a Gilbert Gottfried joke he did at the Comedy Central roast of Bob Saget. 
$C: ah thanks for the context. it looked like spam to me
$C: Welcome to free market forces. 

If your ads are intrusive and awful, they will be done away with, and generally ignored. Products (such as ad blocker) will be invented to improve lives. 

Companies will then be forced to adapt to create a better product so they can monetize their websites in a different way. 

You’re arguing to keep an old, inefficient revenue model at bay, rather than innovating and pushing for a new one. 

You don’t say no to vaccines simply because doctors need revenue treating illnesses. 
$C: So your main arguments for doing away with NN is that because the servers are private therefore ISPs should be able control to which sites we go? You do know the free and open Internet has been one of the most important creators of new wealth, businesses and opportunities in the last century right ? It's basically a utility, it's a necessity in the 21st century, a something like that deserves  to be free. 
$C: You may have meant r/crage instead of R/crage.

$C: They do a fucking Harlem shake in it
$C: Look, truth be told there probably ARE idiots on here, that said, this entire thing is not wrong because Pai is "mean" or "an idiot" this is wrong because those voting had severe conflicts of interest and stood to profit from the repeal, ethically speaking they should not have been allowed to participate in the vote as a result, many of them received large sums of money from large ISPs which then influenced their vote, this entire thing has been an example of how corrupt our system has become.

I don't CARE about Pai's personality, I care about his politics, which as based entirely in greed and selfishness
$C: You have no clue how the world works at all do you ??
$C: Yeah good luck being a student or even getting a job without acces to the internet. We don't live in the 60s you idiot.

That said, SOME aspects of the internet are intertainment, however, almost all jobs now require online application, my previous place of work would throw any physical applications in the trash immediately, this also applies to applications for things such as college applications, scholarship requests, and FAFSA. 

Many people use the internet to take care of finances, to market their businesses and skills, I use it to host my graphic design portfolio since almost all firms will require a digital portfolio.

The internet has become a necessary part of daily life, a valuable tool for education and business, and yes, an excellent source of entertainment.
$C: Srsly
$C: In fairness to them that's what it is. Freedom of regulations preventing ISPs from screwing us consumers over. 
$C: Freedom to nickel and dime users. 

I really need someone with video skills to overlay text on that video.

"You can still binge your favorite shows!" **requires media streaming package: $5/month. Oh also Netflix's cheapest plan is now $20/month cause all the ISPs charge Netflix out the wazoo and they have to pass on that cost to the customers.*

$C: > Even as someone who supports the repeal of NN,

... Why do you support this? Do you work for an ISP?


$C: [deleted]
$C: Here are a list of all cities Google fibers is in https://fiber.google.com/newcities/
$C: Actually, in this case, I'll allow it.
$C: I'm dyslexic... I always get those two confused. 
$C: Ignoring unrealistic boycotts or sites being petty and denying service, why shouldn't net neutrality be left to the states? Seems like a better decision to me. States that want "internet freedom" can have no net neutrality, and others can keep net neutrality. I think it's unfair to eliminate gov regulation laws for states such as California that will prevent new internet startups from coming to fruition.


Anyways, The bigger problem that we should be fighting are the monopolies themselves, not the powers the FCC just gave them. We need more competitors in the market to drive prices down and innovation up. In a free market, net neutrality wouldn't matter as much because people would be able to choose their service based on their own demand. It appears that in the future, ISPs will be able to drain every last dollar out of their consumers due to internet becoming almost a necessity. A truly free market would allow competition to appear, but alas, Comcast and ATT use their lobbying power to prevent the creation of new firms. They even prevent companies like Google from using internet poles and other infrastructure that taxpayers paid for. I don't see how anybody can defend that besides those making millions off of it.
$C: Just reporting the rumor, right?
$C: If he is lucky...
$C: Or worse. We hope.


Don't fuck with the American will of the people.
$C: We can hope
$C: He's a liar and corrupt, and not only that, is really smug about it. That last one pisses me off sooooo much. It's how blatant he is with his lying and corruption. Nothing to say to the millions of comments from real people with real problems, except lies and that stupid, dismissive grin. He doesn't even have the decency to pretend to care.

His few arguments are easily dismissed with just the slightest bit of common sense or data, because he doesn't really have to put in any effort. After all, he's not elected, who gives a fuck! Man, he gets my blood boiling so much I can't even bring myself to watch that video.
$C: I wonder how many people are a lost job away from killing a person. Or having cancer. Or just having to watch that disgusting video. Cooking meth is great if your end game is to be Heisenberg, but id rather end this comment.
$C: Seems so.
$C: down with the Bourgeoisie!
$C: https://youtu.be/EewyxUQpYls
$C: Dude. No.
$C: Yeah because that'll really help the cause. Congratulations you go from being protestors to rioters. Violence will fix everything.
EDIT: Wow you guys really are nuts enough to incite violence on people. That's pretty depressing. I probably use the internet more than all of you but I'm not gonna throw my morals out the window because someone stepped on my shoes. If he was a terrorist running around hurting people I'd understand your violence but no he's a paid puppet. You guys wanna hurt the puppet and not the puppet master. Tear him down go ahead another one will be put up in his place and you just hurt someone for no reason. Take away any credibility the protest has because you go from being the good people to the bad people.
$C: He says in the article that people should debate the merits of policy instead of harassing him. He refuses to take into consideration what the vast majority of Americans think. He doesn’t care about the merits of policy, he cares only for money. When the internet is censored in the very near future the only way to tell him anything will be by putting signs up on his lawn. 
$C: By a fucking billboard stating the truth about their complete piece of shit of a father. They're gonna learn sooner or later. 
$C: I don’t think his kids should be targeted because of it... it’s not their fault their father is an asshole. I’m more nauseous that the POS reproduced in the first place. 
$C: Alright well that's actually not cool.. And I really am not advocating we go beat this guy up (though I'm sure a large portion of Americans would) but his kids have no part in this.. And that kind of abuse could have implications that fuck with someone for a really long time. 
$C: With how this administration is being run what difference does the legality of anything mean anymore.. as long as your rich and have the right political ties..
$C: You can wish death upon anyone. You just can’t make threats. I hope he dies painfully. I wouldn’t ever take steps to make it happen but I am gonna pray for it. 
$C: That’s actually why people want an actual law — this can go back an forth forever quite easily as long as it’s just an FCC regulation
$C: Ya and I'm also not ready to say Obama was amazing. I think it's fair to say he had his share of controversy.. but when this entire administrations goal is to be anti Obama it's extremely petty and honestly shows the true colors of the Republican party 
$C: Yeah, it was great as having president Trump appointing someone who'll fuck with the Internet was a joke back then. 
$C: So?
$C: Thanks I'm really searching deep but my heart is a bottomless pit so it may take awhile. Btw I hope you see the irony of your comment
$C: Taking control of something that is a great part of todays society and a big source of media and information against the people's will isn't "hurting ones feelings". It's tyranny. You take control of the internet you are in full control of the people.
$C: The fact that it's hard to tell is disturbing. 
$C: Thanks.
$C: Saywhat you want you know I'm right 
$C: States’ rights, bay-bee!  :D

In all seriousness, it could be as simple as a city or state telling the telecoms they can’t throttle signal within their jurisdiction, and let them figure out how to implement it.

The telecoms companies have been doing something similar with cellphone plans, so they should be able to make it work. The localized Paris Climate Accord restrictions would also serve as a model, to some degree.
$C: His job is consumer protection.  He's not doing that.  
$C: Yeah well, my mattress sucks, and I really need to get a new one. Here's an idea: instead of waiting until I buy a new one before I throw out my old one, I'll just go ahead and throw my old one away now. Sleeping on the floor is really the best way to tell my body I need a mattress, but I'll never understand that until I don't have one.

If the mentality of republicans here was that the FCC couldn't be *relied* upon to enforce net neutrality and it really requires a law passed by Congress, where is that law? Just like my mattress, the new one should be here before I throw away the old. 
$C: That's broken logic. That's like removing the tourniquet and letting the wound bleed on your way to the hospital. There is no point in repealing this if you agree with a need for neutrality when you can leave it in place WHILE pursuing legislation.
$C: I'm sure the Republicans in congress will get right on that... 
$C: I believe it already is
$C: Principles don't count for shit if you abandon them in special cases.
$C: Nah, don't blame the child for Sins of the Father, but certainly ridicule the child if he maintains and shred of respect for his father.
$C: Such punchable teeth too
$C: Gaurantee you you got banned for trolling 
$C: Stop hurting my feelings, meanie 
$C: Awesome, I only ask because they retain a lot of diacritical marks that have gone by the wayside (like rôle, for instance).
$C: I know it’s not a partisan issue. Unfortunately Trump and his ilk have made it that. His base will believe anything he says, like that net neutrality is just Obama-era regulation to crack down on conservative media, and just run with it.

It’s a dangerous world when idiots unknowingly spout misinformation that they believe is true bc they’re too stupid/indoctrinated to do their own research. 
$C: It is a partisan issue, almost all Republican politicians are against NN
$C: THIS. Ignorant/stupid people who use the argument of 'prior to 2015 rules' are more rampant than I would have ever thought. Pretty much the only defense they use too.
$C: The 2015 FCC reclassification of broadband as Title II period dipshit. 
$C: I am literally sitting at my desk in the network engineering department of the company I work for as I type this. I have a CCNP, Cisco Certified Networking Professional certificate and do this shit in my sleep. 
$C: It always boggles me when people say both parties are equally bad. I mean from an outsiders point of view (im not american), the republican party seems much worse to me than the democratic party. They both have their faults ofcourse, but the GOP sometimes almost seems wicked compared to their counterparts.
$C: So get him fired and vote him out
$C: Iowa.
$C: You mean to tell me i’ve been lied to?
$C: These people are spreading anti-democracy propaganda; that's all it is. They truly do not believe in government of the people, by the people, and for the people. "Democracy" and "republic" are entirely different axes on the "what kind of government is this" graph.
$C: It is the same, but Why is it so strange? I just chose the phrase "constitutional republic" instead. 

$C: "You people"? Who exactly are "you people"? 
$C: That sounds pretty democratic to me. 
$C: I disagree. Democrat representatives hold themselves accountable to their constituents. When they held power, they introduced SOPA/PIPA, which were fucking terrible. They relented after enough outrage was generated.

The outrage regarding net neutrality has been twice as loud, but this time republicans are in power. Only problem is, republicans are not held accountable by their constituents like democrats. They are held accountable by whatever controversy is being pushed by conservative media, which refuses to touch actually important issues with a ten-foot pole. Anecdotes about immigrant crime and Hillary Clinton’s new book are far more important than preserving the functionality of the internet.
$C: I don't disagree with a thing you just said. The OP however was heavily implying this should be the sole issue. Which I don't agree with. Definitely something to consider and the implications against the person's character. But there is a lot more to it.
$C: Not at the expense of any action being taken. You try to dissuade us from this tactic because you doubt it will work. The doubting is fair, but the dissuasion is not without an alternative. You're arguing for inaction, which I can't abide. 

You can point it the fault without calling for inaction. You did not. That's where you went wrong.

Also, you handled it with a lot of hostility. Nobody likes that. You weren't being direct, you were being abrasive.
$C: I just don't think people care. The whole calling everything fake news fetishism has fucked us. And so has "so long as the libtards are against it I'm for it!" And the other way round. 

But hey. If I'm wrong I'm happy. 
$C: Better than not whining at all. That is after all what we all just did. Send a letter whining to our reps.
$C: Their function is lawmaking. They are at the moment incapable of doing that, if you have not seen. I think they would be better suited as fertilizer than lawmakers, but why does it matter I'm certain the people who wrote the patriot act have my best interests in mind. 
$C: I think it's wrong that geordil is being attacked for having stated a fact. You could have simply said "Well, they voted now, and it came out how we thought it would." You didn't have to tell him to "Shut the fuck up". You were being aggressive for no reason. And if spez had just waited a few more minutes before posting, this pointless comment thread would not exist, while the thing with actual content still would.
$C: Nope.
$C: Stop being ridiculous.
$C: Your sense of entitlement is beyond insane. Its literally astonishing. No wonder other countries hate the USA.

You are literally trying to convince me about how people cant survive without internet when I do it on a constant basis. 

Go spend 3 months on Baffin island and come back and tell me how no one can survive wihout internet.

Yes. You can live without internet. No, you cannot compare it to water or food or heat or shelter, because no, you will not fucking die without internet. You will fucking die if you freeze to death, or starve to death, or dehydrate to death.

If you find even one article where someone died due to lack of internet, you will hold MAYBE announce of merit to me, u til hen you will just be anoher greedy sheep that believes money is eveything.

Go learn how the rest of the world works m8, you will be surprised.

Literally a walking example of the issue right here. Im goin to save this just to use in he future to prove my point about people like you. I have a nice album going, pherhaps I'll post a greatest hits.

So I will repeat it once more... no, we do not need the internet, it is but a convenience.

This mob mentality of the internet being inherent to everything we do is causing this problem to begin with, and it wont stop until idiots like you stop spreading misinformation, as well as quit endorsing hese crooked fucks to begin with.

Yes, if you want your mcdondalds to shove in your face, your luxury sedans, your pets, your self making coffee, your uggs, your video games, your new iphone every year, then yes, yo NEED the internet.

If you want to actually be a part of the solution and not a first world proble  whiney bitch, the you could always stand up for whats right.

Ill be right here, standingnupmfor the people that deserve it. Not..... filth... like you.
$C: The problem is money in politics and money in media. You don't have the time, money, means, or intelligence to topple that beast legislatively. This is just a game you can't win. The only way to fight unchecked capitalists is with capital. You use their capital to negatively affect their capital, in a way that forces change. Anything short of that, and you've lost.

And I'm all ears here for proposed effective strategies. The problem isn't that I've proposed a strategy. The problem is that no one else is even attempting to discuss what can actually be done in a capitalist system to make it work for us rather than us for it. So, please, what do you propose we do? Give me a strategy, right now.
$C: The AIC (in reverse) is definitely making them keep it up to monitor Russian activity. (I had a comment ghost removed when I mentioned them doing it in a world news thread).
$C: The terrorists are in the government, not the streets.  We've been playing your little game my whole life and before I was born - it leads to NO CHANGE and NO REPRESENTATION.

I'm fucking sick of being a god damned slave in this country.  It's finally time to rise up.  Stop moving the goal posts and either fight for freedom like we once did, or continue to fall deeper and deeper into slavery as we are now.
$C: Yeah, and no matter how vocal we are they laugh and brush it off because audio offers no threat.  Fuck there's a video on Reddit right now of them reading our pleas to maintain net neutrality and fucking laughing about them.  These people need to fucking die.

If you want these fuckers to actually represent us and do their jobs, they need to fear us.
$C: You know how T-Mobile can have a $40 unlimited plan that includes unlimited music streaming?  They can afford that because Spotify and other streaming services pay them to prioritize their traffic (mobile data isn't subject to neutrality rule).  Prior the the 2015 Open Internet Order, Netflix was partnering with Comcast to build faster infrastructure and in exchange Comcast would prioritize Netflix streaming.  It's just fact that Net Neutrality means slower and more expensive internet.

I personally think keeping the internet open is worth paying more for it, but that's a value choice.
$C: There's technically nothing illegal about it iirc. I'm not a lawyer so I can't be sure, but I figure something would be done about this if it were. So it's just trashy. 
$C: Im more of a internet troll than anything else, cyka.

Actually in all honesty, I take heavy interests in politics and issues of today as they are more likely to affect me, while I occasionally browse the dank memes and the other stuff as a means of personal entertainment, and the Sharia Law thing was because it seemed like something feminists would rally against but don't for some reason....the russian slang is cause I play too much counter strike, and because I can pull off a russian accent pretty well.
$C: This is so weird, any dissent in this post is downvoted.

I like Reddit, but it's pretty obvious that Reddit is not only being manipulated but also has its own interests, i.e. net neutrality actually being repealed.

They were literally silent for the last 3 months, bar a handful of posts including a post bragging about how good OUR user-posts were.

We live in a different world my friend, a sad different world.
$C: If only there was some kind of script to automatically tag anyone who posts regularly in the_donald so I can more readily identify their misinformation and bullfuckery.

$C: I think your confusion is based on the fact that "pedophile" has a different definition in a psychiatric context and a legal one. Specifically, in psychiatric terms, you're a pedophile if you are attracted to prepubescent children, regardless of whether or not you act on that attraction.  

In legal terms, you are a pedophile if you molest someone under the age of consent.   (Also this is an unofficial term.  The term pedophile has no "legal definition"  Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia#Law_and_forensic_psychology

These two definitions don't always overlap. 
$C: According to gallop people are a little more in favor of abortion now.

Conservatives may care more about guns now, I have no idea, but was there any serious push for gun control back then for them to fight against?

Basic income is a fiscal issue.

We're *way* more liberal in terms of gender/minority/lgbt equality. Recreational marijuana is legal in multiple states.

$C: Perhaps, but what are you going to do? Fight some of the largest companies in existence? 
$C: They could discuss general terms in person first, then after general agreement, they would say "okay, just sign this NDA, then we'll send over the paperwork."
$C: Maybe before but now that it passed "the squeaky wheel gets the grease". In other words the conservatives that opposed it will fall silent or into a minority. /r/conservative used to mildly be for it it but now if you go there it's being supported as a good thing getting repeaealed that's upsetting liberals. I think you can imagine how it's going over at an erratic sub as T_D. Feel free to link me to where places like Fox News starts decrying this as a bad thing (as of today or later).
$C: > Net Neutrality Repealed, Left Loses Its DAMN MIND

Is the top post on /r/Conservative.

The Donald has this right up the top,

$C: "Follow the circlejerk" ?
$C: Almost any site can be used as a proxy if set-up properly and it won't be immediately apparent to the ISP because of the way many sites draw info from multiple sources.


Hell, we could even use each other as a proxy.


Them trying to stop proxies will be as effective as them stopping p2p networking. Which is something they've actively been trying to do for 2 decades now but physically can't in a feasible way.


I'm kinda kicking around an idea to make a p2p 'back-up site' service that can push around basic website info (that doesn't need security) and use a network of people to draw info from, thereby minimizing the amount of data speed for each to nearly nothing.


So unless they 'slowed' data speed to zero (which would mean they run afoul of not providing the service they promise) then they would lose almost complete control of the situation. 
$C: Interesting point of view.  I hope you aren't right but do fear the possibility that you are.
$C: Why didn’t they before 2015? Don’t quote the Netflix story, that wasn’t net neutrality. That was Netflix wanting to do more than a business connection was capable of doing. 
$C: VPNs are very tricky to block, that's how people in China access most of the western internet.
$C: Exactly. The VPN package will be the most expensive for sure.
$C: You know that VPN's are used quite extensively for business purposes to secure communication? 
$C: They can try. It will be like China with proxies popping up faster than the ISPs can block them. 
$C: But, legally, would they be able to throttle or block your service on a hunch that you are doing this? They are well aware that people use VPNs for torrents, but they can't just assume "This guy is using a VPN, must be a pirate! Block him!". VPNs and the ability to use the internet anonymously is still our right. 
$C: the catch is that it's a VPN that they control, and all of the regular rules about throttling other connections still exists in full.
$C: Don't forget monthly usage caps
$C: Though if it were hosted outside the US, using an international VPN would then prevent traffic throttling, unless your ISP throttled all VPNs as well.
$C: Because net neutrality is a government restriction on their service.  I can imagine that things were alot simpler for them before... You know, just several years ago when it didn't exist. 
$C: Well there you have it - you are shooting at the wrong target, all of you. Don’t fight for NN, fight for market freedom that will put any ISP that doesn’t maintain NN out of business in a week, through healthy competition. The real problem lies in your “the FCC will block anybody trying to compete”. 
THAT is that problem. That they can do it. And by you guys calling for the same FCC, the same central authority, to keep NN, you’re just again shoving more power to the hands of the wrong people, people who should have no power to regulate, push, or block any business from competing. 

TL;DR - politicians won’t serve the public’s will, ever, because they cannot be bought by the public but can be bought buy corporate. Corporate WILL serve the public’s will, because they are forced to if they want to survive and prosper. Regulators and regulation is the corporations’ trick of going around public will and killing competition, thus denying the public the choice, so that they survive and prosper despite not serving their clients’ will.

Why not? 

On Verizon-owned Tumblr, they even removed posts and hashtags about Net Neutrality. And they didn't give a shit when users noticed. And they didn't give a shit when Tumblr's CEO resigned in protest of what Verizon was doing.

They are stronger than the American people. Because most American people don't give a fuck as long as they can get keep shoveling Hamburgers and Coke into their faces.

Okay so when are you gonna start criticizing r/latestagecapitalism? They do the same thing. 

Stop targeting one thing because it suits your agenda.
$C: If /r/politics (or 2XC, or WorldNews, or any one of dozens of other subs) was a platform for discussion, then you could make that argument. But since any/every bit of criticism doled in their direction is met with bans, and they go out of their way to push their agenda, it's very clear to see that that forum is more of a soapbox than a platform. And that soapbox has been used tell everyone to 'get over it' to this very thing this topic is about.


$C: >But since any/every bit of criticism doled in their direction is met with bans, and they go out of their way to push their agenda, it's very clear to see that that forum is more of a soapbox than a platform.

> I guess I'm against net neutrality!"
$C: I think a multi-party system should be possible over the next 10 years. 
 
Currently your largest voting block is old, tired, and stubborn. They prioritize "the way it's always been" over anything new. Their slogan might as well be "if it aint broke don't fix it!" That amounts to "bah I'm too lazy to think about this, so I'll just vote for no change."
 
As the older generation dies off and the younger generation takes over, you'll see a lot more moves to change. Fractures have been present in both parties for a long time and those fractures are getting wider every election cycle. It won't be long before both parties shatter into 4 parties or more. Hopefully more. 
$C: I said I'm for net neutrality, but that I'm against no oversight government regulators, which shouldn't be controversial after todays events. Yet still down voted. This is exactly why today's events happened. It's not them. It's you. People so against hearing opposing viewpoints they automatically down voted someone who does anything less than ENTIRELY agrees with them. It's okay keep doing it. It's work great for all of you so far /s
$C: That's not how opinions work friend.
$C: We call that democracy.
$C: Damn you’re dumb! You misspelled democracy. 
$C: So just let the ISPs do whatever they want? With no regulation that most Americans want?

Don't use the phrase "My god the mental gymnastics" if in the next breath, you betray your ignorance.
$C: What? Are you telling me I'm wrong somehow? Or are you assuming my position on any of this? I'm not sure I follow. 
$C: You are trying to control the information and services accessible to citizens.  
$C: Alright, so you disagree on that point? What DO the vast majority of Republicans think about the private sector? If you don't believe in the private sector and you simultaneously slash the public sector, then what do you believe in? I guess even more enormous piles of money, then.

It is undeniable that a rollback on net neutrality fucks up small business who CANNOT COMPETE against the likes of Netflix and Google. How can there be competitive services when it is impossible to undercut the market with a better product because you can't pay isps to allow internet traffic onto your site? This is the opposite of what Republicans stand for, as far as I understand it.
$C: Can you elaborate rather than just calling me a mindless sheep?

Debate it, don't be an ass, don't drink the Kool aid
$C: He knows that. He just another redditor Sociopath who believes: "Both Parties are equally evil!!!" No, I take that back. He doesn't *actually* believe that, it just pushes his right-wing agenda of: "I can get people to believe my doctrine, then I can make them vote right-wing."
$C: Can't you imagine that such a competition backed by greed only can also lead to deals and arrangements between companies for the sake of profit that do not benefit the consumers in any way, or can even be detrimental to them? I do not see why you're so sure that free competition should *always* be beneficial to the customers. Logic and history both seem to indicate that it is actually not always the case. 

You seem overly optimistic if you don't thing this can happen, and internet monopolies are a proof to me that such thing do in fact happen. In this case government regulation is a band-aid, not a good one I admit, but a necessary one until we find a better solution to this problem. At least government are subject to our votes. People don't realize nowadays that money is a vote and don't use that as a mean to reward or punish companies. 

Now I mean to say we sometimes need such shitty band-aid when situations is getting even shittier, that is until we can find a system that encourages greed to some extend but does not reward the most extreme cases. The problem isn't greed or free market to me: the problem lies in centralized hierarchical structures. We need new way to organize humans on a large scale, these systems from the past are failing and we need to recognize that, and in that manner the government has the dame flaws as corporations. 
$C: Dude he gave you specific examples wtf are you on about
$C: ... you ok?
$C: THE USER ABOVE IS A MOD AT r/nonetneutrality, and has spammed this message dozens of times pretending to be for net neutrality, presumably because they lead an incredibly sad life. Report and move on.
$C: Wow I wasn't aware that I couldn't both be pro net neutrality and think we should make it easier for new ISPs to enter the market.

Guess I better choose a side!
$C: Your definition of freedom is highly skewed. Sometimes we need regulation to enforce freedom and to protect freedoms. If that you're saying is true, then we need regulations to enforce corporations to stop the consumption of smaller businesses to create more options in the market. Check your logic.
$C: You do know that regulations are not the only things that make monopolies, right? even with low startup costs, oiligopolies tend to form without regulation.

in the case of ISPs, just like water companies and electrical companies, there is this thing called a natural monopoly, created by large infrastructure costs. Please go read an Econ 101 textbook...
$C: What about the legality of destroying a republic? The legality of silencing an entire populace? The legality of allowing charlottesville to happen? The legality of handing the nukes to a man who may or may not have the beginnings of dementia? Legality? Fuck legality. There comes a point when you have to fight for your rights. That time is now, and the legal system is NOT on your side, and they are NOT your friends. They obey laws that were written by senators that have been bought by your enemy.

$C: Great response why don’t you try a little harder next time tho ecxain how that’s a fallacy? How can you complain the republicans don’t vote dem enough but I can’t point out the exact opposite is true? I means what’s wrong with you guys that you can’t just own up and admit the two major parties have a lot more in common than you would think you can laugh all you want but it won’t get you anywhere 
$C: Um, I did. I'm a Berniecrat that voted Trump. Clinton was a horrible option, and many of you still refuse to admit that. I knew Trump would be bad for the country, but at least he's a cartoon that wears his evil on his sleeve. Clinton would be much more subtle and i dont trust her not to fuck things up in less reversible ways. If this is what it takes for the Democratic party to wake up and actually front a progessive, then fuck it. Bern it down.

$C: > The immediate effects on American citizens due to Hillary's election in the primary are not comparable to the effects which will occur due to the NN repeal

You can sure as hell contrast them.

Your whole argument collapses on itself. 

First
>The Democrats, right now, need to push internal issues of corruption aside because the fact of the matter is although they have their own slew of problems, theirs pose MUCH less of a threat to contemporary American democracy than those of the Rs on the other side of the aisle

This has absolutely nothing to do with what we have been talking about, and frankly proves that you still don't understand the train of thought is, you are just seeing this as an "us vs. them" argument, when it never was that.

The argument that the corruption at the FCC level is more significant than the corruption at the DNC is ridiculous.

The DNC are the ones who decide who will be running for THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. If they are corrupt, then NO ONE has a say in who gets a chance to run for the leader of the united states... let it sink in a bit and tell me you want to keep arguing that the DNC being corrupt doesn't effect the people.

>Just because Hillary was brought up, the comment was moot in this discussion

LOL what? Why?

She is the past? EXACTLY, what do you think examples are? you can't make an example out of something that hasn't happened yet. Once again you are failing to understand the actual argument being made and want to see red vs. blue.


$C: > Removing power from the companies who you want to expand

> That's the thing. None of us want any of the companies in power of the internet

Yes, none of you want the very companies who build and expand the infrastructure to have power over their own infrastructure.

Take a step back and think about that. 

>All of them should be completely broken apart and their infrastructure should be made open to the public.

Which would encourage better and faster speeds, and more options.... how exactly
$C: Yes, the people that put in infrastructure don't want to lose control of their own infrastructure

Duh?

>These companies need to be broken up like ATT back in the day and have their regional monopolies destroyed

Tell me, how would that benefit the consumer? Honestly.
$C: So no matter what happens, no matter how they vote, you think they're bribed

I mean that's incredible, thank you for the insight into your world
$C: He's a TD poster, don't bother.
$C: You say that they way people choose to express their unhappiness shouldn't detract from the validity of their underlying claims.

Firstly: Maybe you don't mean to imply so, but just for clarity: I don't believe that someone who makes an inane claim about "the internet being taken away from them" or somesuch actually has a measured and reasonable underlying belief they are just expressing in a crass way. I have seen many examples that people literally have grossly unreasonable beliefs. 

Hence, we sholdn't have the image that the person writing that "THEY ARE STEALING THE INTERNET" necessarily or almost certainly has a reasonable belief underlying that. It's also quite probable that they also have a strong yet very diffuse anger against a vague idea.

Secondly: These are different concepts to discuss. I am talking about the obscenely misleading statements about net neutrality as a separate topic, which is very much worth pointing out. I am seeing people in other countries say in earnest "We are fucked now" and the like. This is a topic in itself, with importance in itself.

It's also not even a reasonable starting point for a discussion. It's similar to "TRUMP WILL PUT GAYS IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS" - is that _really_ an expression of frustration hyperbolically representing the person's very nuanced appreciation of the most likely very minor impact on gays? Or is it just a deranged expression of anger with no reasoning behind it and no inherent invitation for a discussion of what's probably not even underlying it?

>do you think net neutrality will help consumers?

Separate from the issue of lies and agitation about net neutrality above: I think net neutrality will have very little impact at all on consumers, and that it's mostly irrelevant.
$C: Yes, it was better, but it was still low. The point is how can we make it so that 20% is not a high number?
$C: Yes, but I doubt that 80% of the population was being suppressed. I know a hell of a lot of people personally who just don't give a fuck enough to go vote. No suppression involved. 
$C: This right here. I can barely find time to go out and vote between work and school, let alone plan or protest without losing everything I've worked for.

Sporadic voting and auto-generated emails are about the best I can do.  That being said, those emails go out every chance I get. 
$C: Ive been thinling about it for a while, but I'm just a 25 year old data scientist. 
$C: Wasn't it like a oh shit movement. Didn't the ISP's actually try to do it?
$C: Works on non-young people too.
$C: The parties aren't the same but each one as nearly as bad as the other but in different ways. Repubs repealed NN and are screwing up the EPA while Dems introduce anti-2A legislation whenever possible and are making some pretty nonsensical immigration run arounds.
$C: French revolution style executions of the top 1%
$C: We need campaign contribution reform. Desperately. Pay special notice to politicians that promise this and vote for them when the time comes. Pressure them to get it done and vote them out when they don't deliver or their actions don't align with their promises.

It requires us to be alert and informed. It is asking a whole lot of us as citizens, but we have to in order to protect our rights from these power hungry wack jobs.
$C: Vote for people who support net neutrality, and align with people who have done so in the past.

TL;DR: vote for democrats.
$C: The Reddit community should put forward candidates for the seats themselves, every red/blue candidate has their own agenda, and works to party lines anyway.

Lots of talk on this website, more direct action needs to be taken. 
$C: So, vote out all republicans - got it.
$C: Okay I can agree with that.  But for real if these fools go against the will of an overwhelming majority of ppl in America, imo people should get violent
$C: Sorry we're not all neanderthals and would prefer slow progress over starting a civil war. Rome was not built in a day and political progress won't happen as quickly as your instant-gratification mindset would like.
$C: The tax scam that will save my middle class  family $1,800 a year?
$C: I see. That makes a lot more sense now. Thank you.
$C: Because it wouldnt be a thing. Politics are all reactionary. They wouldnt have even thought of it until it was repelled and the outcry came. also obama put pai into office, because republicans forced him to pick between a bag of dogshit and a bag of catshit. Also plenty of democrats take those big checks everyone criticize the republicans of taking just from different companies. 
$C: Except in this instance, it's not fake, it's using previous personal information to convey an opinion that doesn't truly reflect my own.

I'm not making "proclamations of doom", I just don't like the idea of a false opinion/statement being made on behalf of myself in a public forum that's actually supposed to be used to form a potential legal change.
$C: Well, i can't lie, you'll make more money from med school in the U.S than Canada. But i find that quality of life is much better here, even though we make less money. I've traveled a lot in the U.S, and although I've had some great experiences, i just could never see myself personally live there. I find Canada has less extremes. Not really politically, although that also.
$C: So pretty much what slacktivism has been from day one.

Why the fuck are people protesting AFTER the fact. I don't understand this, they did this with Trump being sworn in. What the fuck was going to change?
$C: Sure Buddy.  Sure.

$C: Damn it, lol. I'll just keep it in at this point
$C: > louder thAn

I seriously can't believe I made that typo, must go fix it.

$C: That black and white chicken sketch from a few weeks ago was truly awful. 
$C: This guy is asking for an act of terrorism, for keeping net neutrality, just let that sink in, violence is not the answer

I mean think about it, if this vote was bombed to keep net neutrality, what would everyone think about it? Everyone would be afraid to have a differing opinion, sure it's not your opinion, but why would you force someone to live in fear just so you could have net neutrality, the more peaceful it plays out, the more likely it is that more people will support net neutrality.
$C: nope. asking for a place to be bombed to create terror and mayhem is terrorism.

edit. what about all the people there who are against it?
$C: To be fair, it is absolutely terrorism. Literally, by definition. 

However, terrorism can work. As proven by the utter success of the 9/11 attacks on my fair city.  The stated goal with that attack was to scare us enough to pull us into a war with no clear enemy and no way out and bleed our economy dry. They totally succeeded. 
$C: Terrorism is disgusting give it to the left can't get their way must have a revolution must kill if you're that angry about NN being repealed give shit to ISPS not 1 guy doing his fucking job and he clearly did it pretty well 
$C: Doubtful.  The Americans were attacking military units, not civilians... because we were the civilians. 
$C: We didn't bribe though.  Maybe just a large GoFundMe?  If that's all they want is the money I could throw in a few bucks, it will save me big money in the future anyway
$C: [deleted]
$C: You can vote.  Millions across the country did not.  Violence is not acceptable.  
$C: Use the second amendment rights you guys keep championing for something other than a red neck hunting a deer with an AK.
$C: Oh you support violence huh? Go do some them ya big strong internet warrior.  You know where he works.  

I know you aren’t going to because your all talk and no action.  Pussy.  

Calls for violence are not acceptable.  A simple act of Congress fixes this all so go out there and vote in the mid terms (something millions don’t even fucking bother with).

The vote today is purely ceremonial.

Literally.

[Watch the recap and at the 2:17 when all this starts](https://www.c-span.org/video/?438447-1/fcc-vote-repealing-net-neutrality-rules&vod) you will hear them say "LEAVE EVERYTHING" 
$C: Your comment kind of proved my point. But there are people who would fight over it so things would get messy
$C: Hopefully more than a threat
$C: per the youtube livestream, everyone is coming back.
$C: When he gives you a promotion for bringing such wonderful content into his life make sure to think of me 
;)
$C:  But what does MINE SAY??!
$C: They'll simply have law enforcement remove the people from the area once it becomes too inconvenient. Peaceful protest doesn't work, hasn't worked and cannot work when the people in power no longer care about the common people. They don't care about what you or I want, or what we have to say. They're going to do what they want anyway.

If violent protest happens, it will not be the fault of the protesters. It will be the fault of the government officials who ignored their constitutional responsibilities, and the desires of the people they're supposed to represent, in order to make money for themselves and their friends. If something happens, it's because they've driven us to that brink by removing all other options from our grasp.
$C: Sure. The population changes quite dramatically after these sorts of events.
$C: Before everyone grabs their guns and heads out into their backyard for Guerilla Warfare. Maybe just educate yourself and spend 15 minutes voting every year instead of every 4?

Elections. Have. Consequences.

Every single pseudo-intellectual fuck who moans on about how both sides are the same is deluding themselves to make excuses for their political apathy. 

This was decided last November. 

/r/BlueMidterms_2018 

$C: Democrats are not perfect, but Republicans unilaterally have made this past year a living and future hell for all of us in the States.

Voting would have mattered if Clinton was elected, and I'm not even a fan of hers - she was clearly the lesser and more easily influenced devil than Trump (and all his peer Republicans, who are essentially the same without the loud bragging).

Let's face the facts:

Pai is implementing what Trump and other Republicans have requested since Obama's days.

3 Republicans out-voted 2 Democrats on this panel.

107 Republicans in Congress signed a letter to Pai, asking that Net Neutrality be repealed.  No Democrats signed that letter.

The Federal government - all three branches - is controlled by Republicans this year.

Under Obama (a Democrat), he built on what Bush Jr. started and enabled Net Neutrality with a mixed bag Congress.

. . .

See the pattern?  This is what happens when not-only-Republicans are in charge:

https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/25/technology/path-clears-for-net-neutrality-ahead-of-fcc-vote.html
$C: Electing better officials would solve this issue.
$C: That's because they want their violent revolution fantasy.
$C: His party voted against net neutrality before. This was a surprise to you guys that net neutrality is dead? 

How? Why? 

Ajit Pai is NOT an elected official. He doesn’t answer to us directly. There is an elected official who put him there. 

There were plenty of elected officials who were in favor of net neutrality and worked for legislation to protect it. 
$C: It’s scary quite honestly. 

I feel like I need to who people voted for before they open their mouths. There’s a clear history of one party being against net neutrality before as well. Idk why people thought that was going to magically change.
$C: Why is it you think repealing NN is corruption but the original passing of them wasn't?
$C: The bigger picture that justifies you killing people? Yeah, you're right about that. I definitely don't see that.
$C: TBH it should be done. It'll never happen in a million years though.
$C: Our founding fathers would call us pussies. If ANY government official had participated in shady operations to the extent that they are today, that person would be fucking buried in a day. No good for humanity, so get the fuck out of it. 

We have lost the mentality "take the good and leave the bad" and replaced it with "take the good and take the bad, and fucking deal with it"

It is pathetic, and we are pathetic as a nation and as a goddamned species. Pa.fucking.thetic.
$C: But law and order should be the goal. Violence needs to be the ultimate last resort and I honestly don't believe we're at that point yet. I don't want people getting hurt or hurting anyone else. Public outrage is good, but I don't want violence if we can avoid it.
$C: Her bed you say?
$C: Exactly.
$C: Not if Ajit Pai is the victim and the killer makes sure cops take him alive to spill out his motives
$C: First, unless innocent bystanders, people dying in war isn't murder. 
Second, now you're throwing around "civil war" 
Third, I didn't say "lol jk" I said it was intended as a joke. I'm not saying that because there is dissent. I'm saying that because revolution is a drastic step over something like this.
Fourth, because you have had run ins where you thought someone was joking only to realize they weren't joking doesn't mean that it's automatically the situation every time afterward. 
Also just throwing this in there (because I'm sure some dense fucker is going to try to exploit it if I don't). People were definitely murdered in the American revolutionary war. ((Also in the civil war(for the extremely dense))).
$C: How it's supposed to work:  We elect officials to support what the MAJORITY of the people want.  
How it's working now:  We elect officials to do what the corporations tell them they want.
$C: Enlighten us all on how the government is supposed to work counter to the idea of 80% majority favor something that paid politicians are trying to repeal?
$C: Care to share how democracy works?
$C: ☝🏿This guy posts at the Donald in case anyone was thinking of bothering to read his comments 
$C: WOW WHAT A COMPELLING ARGUMENT REEEEEEEEEEEEE

Because you’re being a condescending asshole in the face of one of the most blatantly corrupt political decisions made in recent history, and it seems like you’re being fucking stupid on purpose. 

Get the FCC’s dick out of your mouth. I was willing to have a polite conversation about it before they actually voted to repeal it. 

I don’t want to have to pay ISPs to have access to specific content. These fuckers are some of the most blatantly corrupt people in the world even before today and you can’t help but be on your knees for them, as if the word “government involvement” is an evil phrase. 
$C: You seem like exactly the type of person who is easily manipulated.
$C: Exactly. These people are acting like their families are being murdered but at worst, at literal worst case scenario their internet bill goes up. 

Imagine if conservatives acted this way over Obamacare raising our premiums THOUSANDS of dollars a year. 
$C: "I can't post an actual reply so I'll make a strawman argument and rest on my laurels" 

Fuck you and your inability to form a logical argument
$C: Oh yeah think about the elderly's internet bill vs. fucking a few corporations taking over the internet. Wtf
$C: I said your thought process is like it. I never compared it to be as bad as net neutrality. It's not my fault your power of comprehension is lacking. If you want a less sensationalist analogy, compare it to a child with paint given to them by an adult. The child is ISPs. The adult is the country. When the child is given paint to paint with, it's pretty well assumed that the child is not to paint on the walls, but then the child goes and paints on the walls. The adult then has to step in and tell the child to not paint on the walls and supervise the child to make sure that doesn't happen again. Even though paining on the walls is now a rule, it was implied before.
$C: MLK fought for basic civil rights to be extended to all people regardless of their skin color (something Democrats were very much against).

You all are talking about inciting and justifying violence *over the internet going back to the way it was before 2015*.

Talk about making a mountain out of a mole hill. Y'all need Jesus.
$C: [deleted]
$C: A farce that failed to shift the power of the organization of our society to the working class. That was no revolution.
$C: I don't get it, man. I made a few comments about not wanting violence, and they've all gotten downvoted. I hate Pai too, but I don't get the bloodlust.
$C: Actually, I'm 32 and you're opening line combined with your post history shows me that you're a complete fucking moron who isn't worth the time to debate.

Enjoy ignorance.
$C: He's talking about cutting cable/internet lines to get back at Verizon and Comcast. He's really fucking dumb.

The violence you're talking about is more thought out, but i still feel like it wouldn't lead anywhere. There isn't going to be a massive revolution as long as people are able to provide for themselves and loved ones. 
$C: That's it, keep saying big words on the internet. The revolution has already kicked off.
$C: Gonna go out on a limb here and say anyone that is seriously planning any sort of violence isn't talking about it on reddit like you are.

If on the off chance you actually do plan on doing something you probably shouldn't use the medium that your enemy has complete control over.


$C: >You have no clue how violent we can become. 

You're not going to do shit. You think you have the will of the people on your side? You have a bunch of limp wristed soy boys that've never even used a gardening tool before.

Come try and enact your little left wing revolution; all you'd be doing is giving us the chance to declare you domestic terrorists and put you down like the dogs you are.
$C: Lol
$C: Then do it you fucking pussy go and try it and after you die ill laugh.

Oh no you'll have to pay to stream 8k vr loli porn what an atrocity 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Kys HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
$C: And a major war ever 20 - 15 years? Just because it's not on the homefront doesn't mean we've been peaceful. 
$C: Fair point, though I would say that Trump supporters and supporters of the status quo are like 90%+ overlap. They may not think they are, but the evidence suggests otherwise.
$C: Girl. And I don't condone violence because it's what they *want*. 'til all other options are exhausted (which I don't currently believe they are), I'm against it.
$C: Agree to disagree. Apart from the reasons that I already addressed in my previous post (a lack of soldiers for an army, specifically; they just don't have the numbers), I will also say that I have lived in the rural~ish south for my entire life and—from my anecdotal perspective—a lot of these gun toating "badasses" are cowards.
$C: No. He isn't a candidate anymore. He's the president, and considering his current track record and approval rating, people who still support him are willfully ignorant or delusional.
$C: If that candidate was Trump, then yes, you're insane.

Just because he has the title of candidate in front of him, doesn't mean he and you are infallible in your beliefs. 

So if you voted for Trump, you're a big part of the problem of us being here today. Fuck you, and shame on you.
$C: Did you even read the last part of my comment?

Revolution is not like your masturbatory fantasies. How are you expecting to get any of those? You think you're just gonna go up to Russia or China or any other country at geopolitical odds with the US and expect them to give you a functional army's worth of weapons?

God, Reddit is living proof that people should wait a bit for the dust to settle before voicing their opinions on anything.
$C: Who won the popular vote again?
$C: >The majority not "liking" an administration is not grounds to violently tear down the foundations of our nation.

It's not just "not liking" the administration, they are specifically taking actions against their own constituents and proving they have no consideration for the will of the people. The foundation of our country was built on government for the people, the founding fathers would be begging us to revolt.
$C: So who voted for Ajit Pai then? Oh that's right, nobody. He is not an elected official and was clearly bought and paid for. You can spout off about the law all you want, but we would be better off without people like him in this world.
$C: > You're not supposed to like them, they govern you.

Nonsense. Governing is not supposed to be punishing, it's supposed to be helpful. You *are* supposed to like those who govern because they should be governing in a way that is *beneficial* to you. 
$C: It's actually in the Declaration of Independence that overthrowing is a right. Also it's arguably implied in the second amendment.
$C: **Soapbox**

A soapbox is a raised platform on which one stands to make an impromptu speech, often about a political subject. The term originates from the days when speakers would elevate themselves by standing on a wooden crate originally used for shipment of soap or other dry goods from a manufacturer to a retail store.

The term is also used metaphorically to describe a person engaging in often flamboyant impromptu or unofficial public speaking, as in the phrases "He's on his soapbox", or "Get off your soapbox." Hyde Park, London is known for its Sunday soapbox orators, who have assembled at Speakers' Corner since 1872 to discuss religion, politics, and other topics. Blogs can be used as soapboxes within the context of the World Wide Web.

$C: Yeah, I don't get how this is insult.  He is saying Hillary would have listened to the American people and stopped this from happening.  *what a bitch!* /s
$C: Because if another company does that, all of their customers will leave and go to your company. So if you don't adopt those policies, you gain all the customers that drop their provider that's screwing them over and make butt tons more profit
$C: They could, or they could just not. If they don’t, all the customers who were detrimentally hurt by the changes would switch over. 
$C: >if nothing changes really drastically, then come election time no one will remember.

Which is why it really would not surprise me one bit if nothing DOES change drastically for quite a while. Make it easy to blame whoever comes next for whatever problems may come. "It wasn't getting rid of NN that made the internet horrible! It's the fact that the democrats are in power again!"

I'm not really much of a conspiracy nut irl but if they were really smart they'd protect their people for the next time they need them.
$C: History has also proven to us countless times that capitalism works and that stifling free market doesn't end well. Not wanting to pay for something doesn't mean you should restrict and industry's ability to charge you for it.
$C: Did you just say the internet was a basic human necessity?
$C: > vote what I feel

Curious as to if you always vote with emotion or vote for what logically could benefit you in the future as well?
$C: What if he is just replaced by somebody worse and more extreme?
$C: I think you mean Democrats, since every "mass shooter" in the last decades have been registered Democrats, or have espoused Democrat-like political opinions. 
$C: This guy is a lying, spamming troll. He's actually a mod at r/nonetneutrality, trying to make the opposition look bad.
$C: >this guy just advocated for terrorism.

tbf Pai also just advocated for terrorism, just in a more subtle and not immediate way. More extortion, less loss of life, but still terrorism. Pay X or else vs Do X or else.
$C: Guns and abortion
$C: the gulag is too kind for pigs like him
$C: I feel ya, but at what point does being compassionate and forgiving truly not work anymore? That time is coming. We can't be naive to think we can vote away their wealth and greed. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: It hasn't yet at least. The fact that Net Neutrality is even a partisan issue right now is ridiculous to me. A bunch of Democratic Senators told the FCC to wait and delay the vote so they could actually hold hearings, while a hundred Republican Congressmen sent a letter to the FCC telling them that they're doing a good thing by repealing Net Neutrality.

For the time being at least, the Republican Party is attacking my livelihood with their current behavior. All of my income, all of my work, happens online. I will always have to vote against the party that wants to hurt my livelihood in favor of pandering to the ISPs. For the foreseeable future, that is the GOP.

If our elected democrats start fucking around too, I'll vote against them as well. 
$C: No he wasn't, Ajit Pai has held various positions in the FCC since 2007.

YES, he was recommended for the position of commissioner by Mitch McConnell, who was Senate Minority Leader at the time. And YES, it was Obama who accepted the recommendation and made the nomination, I assume because he was trying to work with the Republicans even then, even as they stonewalled him on everything.

But it will always be Trump who named him Chairman, knowing what Ajit Pai's position on Net Neutrality was. We all knew what Ajit Pai's position was, mostly because of the dissenting speech he gave in 2015, when under Obama, Net Neutrality was enshrined by the FCC.

There's no way to spin the blame on Obama for this one. This vote rests at the feet of Ajit Pai, and the Republican Party who have endorsed and supported his attack on an Open Internet.

EDIT: Also important to note, the FCC Commissioners have to be split 3/2 along political party lines. There can never be more than 3 Republicans or 3 Democrats sitting on the FCC Board. Ajit Pai was nominated for a seat that had to go to a Republican individual.
$C: It's just basic assessment of accomplishments and legislative agendas.  It's not hard. And it's not about "belief" 
$C: Then why did you bother asking your question?

Not every representative has sold out. Pay attention to what's happening around you and don't just assume the worst.
$C: > Netflix paying comcast

To quote the article you linked "The video-rental company has agreed to pay Comcast for direct access to its broadband network"

So in this case that agreement isn't actually subject to regulations because it's an infrastructure agreement about direct connections. So even if the net neutrality agreements are in place this agreement gives netflix an advantage over it's competition by having the infrastructure to deliver more data faster.

> considering here VOIP providers are worried about NN being removed

VOIP were some of the biggest arguments [against title II](http://www.tmcnet.com/channels/business-voip/articles/399293-voip-innovators-criticize-fccs-title-ii-decision.htm) ever being implemented back in 2015.

In fact the FCC initial action on VOIP was to try and [declare it illegal](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-pulver/fear-and-loathing-as-tele_b_5654881.html)

"The conversation always came back to the question of the legality of using IP networks for voice services. The uncertain legal atmosphere made it extremely difficult to attract investors in Vonage. Everyone assumed the FCC would put a stop to startup’s “bypassing” the telephone networks via the usual all-good-things-come-to-an-end sentiment. The history of telecommunications policy includes plenty of examples where government prosecuted innovation as a crime under Title II rules. The first FCC petition after the arrival IP communications argued for declaring VoIP software illegal."

> That is why NN rules have exceptions for that. Literally a part of European NN rules.

We're not talking about the european rules. We're talking about the american title II rules which do *not* have that exception. That's why it's considered a poor framework.

> So poor families don't watch Youtube? Where the heck do you get that idea?

I'm not sure how much you interact with poor families, but there are many that don't because they don't have home internet because it costs too much. There are families who use month to month cell phone plans and have to turn it off every other month to afford the bill. I'm talking about the ability to have a plan to at least bring some internet to these families as opposed to the current status quo of none. A cheap plan that lets kids in these families do research for school from home would be a benefit rather than detriment.

> So title 2 won't actually fix any problems, just introduce new ones for online services.

Right. So this vote is to remove those new problems. We agree title II is bad here?

> they literally did it in the past without any problems

I think you need a bit of a history lesson on what happened with comcasts abuses. A few of these are actually outside the scope of title I and title II.

So previous generation of the internet had companies that hosted servers and and users. They sent and received data. Well backbone ISPs charged smaller ISPs for the extra data they carried for them. Backbone ISPs sent each other large amounts of data all the time, but rather than the headache of tracking the exact amounts came up with peering agreements. Some of these basically said "we each send each other about equal amounts of data so we'll just connect our networks and not charge each other". Others agreed to charges based on the ratio of data sent.

So later in comes comcast. Well comcast doesn't host servers and their network is all downstream to users over cable and not fit for upstream. Mix this with the introduction of music streaming. This suddenly causes and uproar because comcast looks at the data and says "hey you're sending us a lot of data and we're barely sending you any. We should charge you because of the data difference based on how you structure peering agreements"

Well level 3 didn't want to pay because past deals were not setup to deal with a network like comcasts who was all end users. Comcast then held their own customers hostage by disconnecting, those users complained to the websites that didn't work (because other routing that didn't go through level 3 still worked). Those websites then complained to their small isps who complained to level 3. Well level 3 telling all their customers that they don't want to pay comcast didn't go over well so they payed up.

So that became comcasts general principal based on these old peering agreements - if someone sends you a disproportionate amount of data you can charge them for it.

In comes the netflix who is the opposite of comcast, they barely receive data but send out massive amounts rivaling anything else on the internet. So comcast tries to pull the same stunt only netflix has a larger direct pull to customers.

In the end they ended with a similar agreement with netflix connecting directly on comcasts lines.

What we need is new laws that actually make sense for dealing with this kind of thing. Title II is overly restrictive and if you are going to google search responses I'd suggest you read and understand the material you post before blindly saying "here this refutes you"

$C: Yea they're all great countries in their own rights. Canada sounds Iike a decent option too I just thought I'd give you some more variety to choose from since someone had criticised Canada in this thread for having similar problems, but then again a perfect country doesn't really exist. I quite understand your concern with language but I wouldn't worry about that too much if I were you, cause as I said if you live in the capital area around Helsinki you'll be just fine (I'd say around 98% of people you'd meet speak English), and I'm positive the same goes for e.g. Stockholm and Oslo as well. 

But hey best of luck with all this, hopefully you find someplace less screwed up than the US atm. Plus here's a link to the Finnish migration office website http://www.migri.fi/frontpage, if you wanna have a look (better do it fast before your ISP blocks it ;) ).
$C: I know the differences between Cable TV and the internet, thanks. The point is that the market adapts to consumer demand. There are no revolts happening in Cable TV because the market has settled to prices that are fair and the same will happen with internet.


The fact that we rely on the internet for far more important things than entertainment is precisely the reason I believe there is even less to fear, and that we will get very competitive pricing. i.e. I believe the seriousness of our need, our economy's need for the internet makes it simply impossible for any ISP to try give us anything less than great deals without going out of business.

$C: The FCC is supposed to be a neutral regulatory commission acting in the best interest of and in good faith with the citizens of the United States.


They are not, thus the citizenship is rejecting them. Loudly. That’s how our federal democratic republic works. Many things can be regulated at the state level, communications must not be. That would create an impossible to navigate clusterfuck much like firearm regulation. 


This is part of the democratic process of the US, if you don’t participate now, you don’t have the right to blame everyone else when it doesn’t go your way.
$C: Fun fact: a single web browser page load can make back-end service calls to dozens of applications that may be using servers literally scattered all over the country.  For example, my web application that gets hosted in the Amazon cloud can be deployed to "US-East".  Beyond that, the application is actually simultaneously running in multiple different data centers up and down the eastern seaboard, may be cached in another several sites around the globe, and inject Google AdWords advertisements who has their application servers scattered in hundreds of sites around the globe.

There is logistically zero way for a state to even begin to regulate only the traffic coming from/going to their own state.

*Thinks Net Neutrality has ANYTHING to do with private site comment administration*

Fact: You are talking out of your ass.

>Net Neutrality was a made up concern in 2015

Really? Because a court case in 2014 made it perfectly clear why it was required. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications_Inc._v._FCC_(2014)

The FCC was literally incapable of holding any ISP accountable in a court of law without Title 2 classification under that ruling. Whether you "Agree" with it or not is irrelevant, the United States Court of Appeals ruled that this was a necessary classification for the FCC to even do its job as a regulatory entity at all.

But sure "Obama made it up". I'm sure "Crooked Hillary's Butter Emails" were somehow involved as well. 

$C: Aw yeah, give me that sweet sweet neurotoxin robo daddy!
$C: I feel that at some point it should be. Hell, given the public's positions here, I'd even upgrade this to honest-to-God low-level tyranny, and you know what they say about that.
$C: At some point in the future, being this corrupt and bought by money, when dealing with the public. It needs to be, that or life sentence in jail


$C: It's what we have and they are garbage. My internet goes down a couple times a day and has intermittent latency, but I'm told fair point is even worse.
$C: It's starting to roll out now, whether through the "last mile" approach where someone like Google rolls out mini-towers connected to their fiber backbone or Verizon launching their 4G internet service that gets real-world speeds of 953Mbps. You better believe if all you have to do is buy property and put up wifi towers to get a whole city connected to fast internet, it's going to happen from a bunch of people you've never heard about before. 

For example, where I live we now have four competitors that are planning on launching gigabit internet (not counting wireless companies), and I live in Arkansas. The barriers to entry are going to start disappearing soon. 
$C: If those companies throttle online content that are deemed competitors (like the Verizon/Netflix thing), there are already laws on the books that handle those problems without FCC intervention.

You don't hear any dissenting Net Neutrality opinions on Reddit because it's mob rule right now. Most can't even explain to me why the opposition may actually want this regulation to be removed, only that they're evil people that are also corporate lackeys. There's no point in even debating.
$C: He had the ability to choose whoever as long as it was an Republican option. Did he not? 
$C: People here don’t like facts, this SOPA/PIPA /net neutrality bullshit is finally gone
$C: That doesn’t make sense.
$C: It’s racist to disagree with someone of color. 
$C: No, you're completely missing my point. I never alluded that the constitution will never be perverted, I said that we should avoid it, just like we should have avoided the 18th in the first place. We should avoid a constitutional amendment regarding the regulation of the internet because that introduces positive rights. Positive rights conflict with negative rights which would lead to a whole load of problems.
$C: > They are robbing you blind, and its sickening

They aren't, I'm being robbed blind by the British government actually (don't live in America). And besides, those companies purchased the infrastructure and thus compensated the government (and by extension the people) for it, so it's theirs i.e. it belongs to shareholders of Verizon and Comcast (I'm assuming they purchased it and weren't gifted it by the government - again, correct me if I'm wrong!).

> Your philosophical argument collapses, when you recognize that Corporations aren't people 

That doesn't change anything. Take "the right to free healthcare" as an example. It's not a faceless multinational evil bloodsucking corporation providing you healthcare, it's an individual - a doctor or a nurse under the umbrella of a hospital. If "the right to free healthcare" is a right, then it violates the negative rights of the healthcare professional. By all means guarantee your citizens free healthcare, but you can't call it a **right** because it's not.

On the topic of the internet, if access to the internet is a right then you have to force corporations to provide their services to people for free. You aren't asking a corporation to part with their resources, you're asking individuals who own the corporation to do so (the shareholders). I implore you to investigate the nature of public corporations. The infrastructure isn't owned by the American people, what makes you think it is? (I'm not criticising, I'm just trying to educate myself further - the better educated we all are on these topics, the better off we all are)
$C: The internet is not owned by the government.....

$C: I don't want to condemn my children to having to live with that type of voting base, so yet another reason to stop having kids.
$C: > Go ahead, go on strike, stop reproduce. Watch if that prevent the 1% from playing golf.

It isn't about preventing the 1% from playing golf.  It's to prevent one's children from being wage slaves and living under some corporatocracy.

I don't care what they are doing, beyond how it affects us.  I care about the rest of us.
$C: A totally automated society that operates without some degree of human labor is a pipe dream. The bourgeoise will still require exploitable human workers to maintain an automated state-based society.

Furthermore, if the 1% doesn't care if we stop breeding, why have they been so invested in trying to get us to keep doing so for decades with subtle, nuanced tactics like via incentives, propaganda, etc.?

Even those aren't working as well as they used to. Elitists are now openly begging us "pesky employees" to have more children due to the global decline in birthrates. Paul Ryan for instance has just a while ago openly pleaded with millennials to produce more active wage slaves to replace retiring baby boomers.

So I find it unbelievable that our oh-so benevolent rulers are going to play golf with a cool mindset knowing there's going to be less future wage slaves maintaining their favorite courses.
$C: Your post is self-contradictory.

>Having kids is a human being's right.

NOT having kids is also a human being's right.  I'm merely suggested that people exercise *this* right.

What about the child's right to not be born into a world of shit?  I think it's important to view things not only from the parents' (or potential parents') perspective, but also the child's perspective.  They have rights too.

$C: It's not the government that put people in jail. It is specifically a judge who decides your fate. Before you get to present your case to the judge, you have to be arraigned.

There is a process and you have access to lawyers at all sequences of the process.

You shouldn't do it, because it's wrong.  And you shouldn't be protected from the social consequences of doing so.

I'm actually shocked to see so many people rabidly demanding that people be thrown in prison for saying mean words.  It's ridiculous.

$C: Healthcare premiums have been spiking higher *every single year* since the passing of ACA. As someone who has bought insurance through the Marketplace since 2014 I can attest to that. It has little to do with Trump and most to do with the system being purposefully set up to quickly ramp up the premiums whilst being anti-competitive.

$C: Well my point is it's virtue signalling and not real virtue, because when the votes have a chance not going the way that benefits corporations then suddenly the Democrats are suddenly not unified in favor of the people anymore. 

It's good cop, bad cop. 
$C: Obama implemented it..the decision to repeal wasn't up to for deciding at the time. I may also tell you that Pai was appointed by Obama to the same department he is now chair of. 
$C: Which places are you talking about specifically? Also the net neutrality camp is one huge echo chamber circle-jerk, you can’t even deny that. 
$C: Of course it is. They fear the truth.
$C: I know, I just mean a tech company which has an understanding of how people use technology would be better suited to run it than an outdated corrupt government.
$C: We funneled arms and provisions into the UK prior to entering WW2 for years. Do you think that was politically related or not? If not, you're lying.

Also, it doesn't matter if it's a Democracy, a Monarchy, an Oligarchy, or anything else. If the government is doing things that go against the greater good of the people, the only answer that's ever proven to be successful in the history of mankind is what? 

This attitude of trying to be nice and not hold people accountable is disgusting. If people act opposite of the public's best interest in politics, accountability is needed. Not voting them out, not firing them, imprisoning or, if egregious enough crimes committed, execution. It's not a game anymore, heads need to roll to get the message across. 
$C: I’m sorry but It doesn’t say shit, he ran against a literally child molester. If he had lost it would be an embarrassment to both parties.
$C: Why does it have to be those two options? We don't have to give more power to the government or corporations, let the consumers decide. With a free market, the consumer gets to choose where to spend their money, rather than having the government pick winners and losers. And the freer the market, the more competition, therefore better infrastructure, faster growth, more bandwidth, lower prices, etc. Capitalism works.
$C: Wrong, regulation is necessary, but shouldn't be abused. In my opinion
$C: you can't alter legislation by stealing TVs from a store, either.
$C: "The left" isn't planning anything. You are suffering from in-group/out-group bias, which basically means you see people on 'your side' as individual actors capable of making independent decisions, but everyone on the 'other side' as a monolithic entity. 

This isn't about 'getting our way,' btw. This is about people who are informed about what NN means, and people who aren't. The only three possible reasons for being against NN are 1) being a cable exec who stands to profit, 2) being ill-informed and not fully understanding how the Internet works, 3) being so hyper-libertarian you masturbate to pictures of the poors dying of starvation. 
$C: Nor were they intended to. NN was solely and only ever intended to preserve the free and open nature of the Internet, where the sole deciding factor in what sites you visit and what services you use is your decision to do so, not which ones ISPs feel are more economically beneficial to their bottom line. So here again you have someone who clearly doesn't even understand the actual argument calling someone who does insane.
$C: It's interesting how all you the_donald types care about is liberal tears when something legitimately shitty is happening to the internet as a whole.
$C: “Nothings going to change” yeah nothing but the life of every American who browses the Internet which is almost the whole population
$C: Just keep sticking your head in the sand. 
$C: Found the FCC troll account.
$C: It should be, yes. Get with the times. 
$C: so then what features of any given face make it 'punchable' in your opinion. What makes any given face NOT punchable?
$C: I attempted to get him to clarify what he thought made a face 'punchable' as opposed to one that is not, and he chose to ignore the request. So I am left with my original conclusion: he's making a racially charged statement against a non-white based on their appearance.
$C: Fortunately, there are others willing to help educate me without anticipating my questions in a derogatory and smug tone. Thanks anyway. To be direct, I wasn't asking you.
$C: Ohhh, thanks
$C: So you're a "conservative" who typically sides with democrats?
$C: Hi! We've been tracking your internet usage and see that you enjoy using social websites such as Reddit and Facebook. We'd like to let you know that your access to those sites will soon end, unless you upgrade to our social media package for only another $5! You'll get access to 100 tweets a month, unlimited Facebook browsing, and the ability to upload 10 photos of your choice! Reddit, on the other hand, will not be included in any of our packages and your access to that site will end immediately. Enjoy your upgraded social media package!
$C: Pretty sure this dude's mom changing the wifi password is a bigger threat to his internet access than the ISPs.
$C: He skipped all the steps and went straight to #5.
$C: Lol, gets pulled over, sorry officer i need to get home and download the internet before it's gone. I'm all for storing data locally but this is a extreme case. The Facebook and Google's are going to fight to keep you as customers. They are not going to allow isps to block their services. For startups, well they are screwed now.. 
$C: Let me see if I'm following you.

A supporter of Net Neutrality says that they're upset Net Neutrality is going away because politicians are going to impose more restrictions in the absence of Net Neutrality.

I point out that the repeal of Net Neutrality means the exact opposite.

You concede the point, but in the same sentence say that maybe it's a *bad thing* that we don't have politicians "taking everything away gradually".

So if repealing Net Neutrality causes politicians to gradually take over the internet, then it's a bad thing, but if repealing Net Neutrality doesn't cause politicians to gradually take over the internet, and in fact does the opposite, then it's not a "*good* thing".

Awesome. Must be really comforting to not have falsifiable ideas.
$C: Touche, except I don't speak Russian and don't have to see that shit.
$C: The comment isn't really deep enough to have multiple ways, but irony acknowledged.

Though with that said I don't believe "American" is a race. :P
$C: [deleted]
$C: Not really, it was Trump and his Trumplings. Obama codified rules as ISPs were testing the waters with throttling. 
$C: That's a supremely idiotic and childish way to look at it. Just look at Alabama, a few thousand votes have changed the makeup of the congress in the reddest of red states. People like you should be screaming for the 40-50% of non voters to get to the polls. 
$C: This. Your damned if you do and damned if you don't. Hillary would have killed American wages by letting the entire 3rd world in to compete for too few jobs while wages were bid down. Trump kills everything else by giving corporations everything they want. Bernie would have been perfect - national liberalism with border controls and oversight for big business. I'm surprised he just got pushed out and wasn't killed or something. 
$C: > I even voted for Kasich in the Republican primaries as damage control. 

Then you helped Trump get elected. Kasich was a spoiler horse. His main purpose of staying in the race was to split the vote to help get Trump elected in hopes of being his VP candidate.  
$C: Hoooly shit. You're actually pathetic.
$C: You'd have had a choice if you fuckwits actually fucking voted.

You made your bed, now lie in it.
$C: Same
$C: Like most government things, net neutrality was bundled.  Too many corporate protections and not enough consumer protection. I agree that net neutrality needs to happen but it needs to be done just for the sake of consumers, not to increase profit margins of tech giants like google and amazon.
$C: Well, at least we know what the official ISP of Western California will be...

$C: That's the point... Money talks. Once their pockets start emptying, they'll be forced to actually pressure congress to revert the net neutrality repeal.

If they think they're going to benefit from this, they're entirely wrong. I think people are going to get sick from being nickel and dimed everywhere they go on the internet, and will eventually just say "fuck it, I don't need this service, it's not worth it." Why not do it now to make a statement, and let those companies see how this repeal affects their bottom line?
$C: Agreed. Also, from a consumer and professional point of view its a logistical nightmare to live without internet. You can't even apply for a job without the internet now in most locations. Not to mention do your banking, pay your credit card, buy goods and services ( I don't even know where to buy things since Amazon came out and Sears went under.), look for health insurance, buy plane tickets, etc. People use to have to make time to do all of that and there had to be a physical location to get this stuff done which is largely going away.
$C: > I don't think I am.


But you are.  What you think has nothing to do with what is true, and the truth is that you're wrong.  Net Neutrality has literally nothing to do with privacy or meta-data sales.

$C: "Net Neutrality" is a very specific thing we are talking about. Namely the rules/laws introduced by Congress. I do not beleive that those rules that are to be repealed (or not) touch on privacy, datamining or marketing of metadata. Hence why they aren't a part of Net Neutrality as I am talking about here. If that is incorrect, please let me know where it is mentioned, I would like to learn.

It appears you've conflated "Net Neutrality" with "Internet Freedom". While "Internet Freedom" is a good cause to rally for, I do not think that all of the items rolled up under "internet freedom" can be tackled by not repealing the existing Net Neutrality laws. Net Neutrality is a part of Internet Freedom, but it isn't everything under Internet Freedom.
$C: Low effort, bud. :(
$C: Sure, you have a different perspective on what net neutrality means, but it's one that most people don't share. So although you may have a good point, you're saying it in a way that's needlessly confusing for almost everyone.

Evidently, "net neutrality" means one thing to you but something different to everyone else. The thing is, when you say "net neutrality," we hear the latter, not the former.

Effective communication is the responsibility of the speaker, not the listeners. If you want people to understand you, it's up to you to put it in terms that make sense to them.

[Relevant xkcd.](https://xkcd.com/1860/)
$C: > Is it not possible I have a different perspective?

Again, you having a 'different perspective' doesn't change the facts. Your complaints about Reddit have literally nothing to do with net neutrality or the events this thread is discussing.
$C: Absolutely. 

Again, wrong movement.

I don't disagree with you, but NN is not about shouting at site hosts and marketing agencies. If NN fails nothing you've mentioned will matter as ISPs will do anything to milk you for money. Get angry at the people doing the most evil and go from there.

Stop the person murdering everyone before stopping the guy selling drugs. Drugs may hurt people but at least you're not gonna randomly die. When you're sure no one's going to kill you, then go after the methlord.
$C: When Facebook and Google start charging ~$100 a month for access to their services, you might have a point. Since they don't, your deflection away from ISP's to social media companies has no merit. They are different companies, with different services, offering different products. The focus is on ISP's because those are the entities behind net neutrality violations. 
$C: There are definitely issues with those companies and they are well worth looking at, I just think that's a slightly different issue.  Tackle both at the same time by all means but I don't think calling them both 'net neutrality' issues is cogent.
$C: How is reddit not practicing NN? Ignoring the fact that they are not an ISP and are therefore not regulated under it.

Just hypothetically, what do you even mean? 
$C: Your whole shtick is ruined by your own posts telling me to go fuck myself after calling me a useless drone, of course with zero facts behind anything you write. You shot yourself in the foot right from the beginning. Low effort trolling, shame on you 
$C: Sure thing. It was posted to td originally I think. I just stripped it down and applied it here. Correct if needed as well. 
$C: Clearly you are not prone to emotional over-reaction OR violence. You sure showed me.

EDIT: you removed your post and then tried to clarify what it said or didn't say. LOL.
$C: You're an idiot.

$C: No, our propaganda calls us that. I have never believed that to be true for a second. 
$C: No. I am not a bot and I apologize for misspeaking. I meant to say you called a brown man a terrorist. 
$C: You're against people making their own alcohol and gambling their own money?  That's very much anti free choice.
$C: really?  

Client -----> ISP ------> ISP ------> Server

Exept where client/server ISP are the same.

For me to acess content in europe, my ISP must allow the connection to europe and the EU ISP must allow the connection to go on.

Comcast can easily stop incoming/outgoing traffic from/to any EU ISP they want. 

Lets choose an UK one for simplicity: Sky Broadband 

Comcast can tell Sky broadband that it will block all traffic incoming and outgoing to it. Unless it pays comcast for acess. And since Comcast is basically a gatekeeper for over 23 million people Sky has little choice on the matter. Specially since business clients WILL need access to US servers.

This will lead to higher ISP prices in the UK. 

Now, again I am not saying they are going to do this. BUT, THEY CAN DO IT NOW.
$C: Yea that's not how it works, international website most certainly either use a CDN when hosting their site or they've purchased european servers. 
$C: What I wrote it how it will work. And how the fuck am I supposed to know what websites you use?
$C: I'd argue that a $20 collection would probably be a fine investment, but to hell with paying full price per installment.
$C: Name any other business that is able to mistreat it's customers so horribly and still remain profitable.
$C: that is never going to happen.

$C: Not really though. He is still just one vote on the FCC. You said he "joined" as if it was solely his choice. Obama appointed him and the US senate unanimously confirmed him. So I think you should probably also direct your outrage at every single sitting senator in 2012. 
$C: kill ajit pai
$C: kill ajit pai
$C: So Obama didn't have a choice but Trump did?

Both Obamas administration and Trumps administration are responsible for this. Neither get a free pass. You can't tell me Obama, The President of The United States, didn't have a choice.

He certainly could've chosen any other person but he decided to listen to Mitch McConnell. If there's some other information I'm missing feel free to enlighten me but I highly doubt there's more to it than that.
$C: If it wasn't Ajit Pai they'd just appoint another Republican. They campaigned on killing net neutrality and the country elected them.
$C: Thanks for consuming your daily soy quota
$C: I am not privy to that knowledge, i was simply making a statement that they all received payment from telecom companies IIRC.
$C: Democrats were unanimously for Net Neutrality in the senate, though there were 6 Democrat shits the House that should be on the list to be primaried next year (out of 183).

$C: **Regulatory capture**

Regulatory capture is a form of corruption. Specifically, it is a government failure which occurs when a regulatory agency, created to act in the public interest, instead advances the commercial or political concerns of special interest groups that dominate the industry or sector it is charged with regulating often relating to an Oligarchy. When regulatory capture occurs, the interests of firms or political groups are prioritized over the interests of the public, leading to a net loss to society as a whole. Government agencies suffering regulatory capture are called "captured agencies".

$C: > Right, democrats only think of people.

[According to the votes](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2pwhvt/the_differences_between_the_democratic_party_and/), yes, they do. Obviously not all of them, but if you were to label one party as "the people's party" it would be the Democrats. Unions, for example, are a liberal thing.

>hey would never, say, take advantage of a certain section of the population that votes for them 90% and ignore them, exploiting their minority status and relative poverty via workfare programs for votes?

I'm black. I vote for Democrats not only because they see me as a human and recognize the importance of racial equality for all Americans, but also because they aren't full of white supremacists and literal actual nazis like the Republican party. The same Republicans who used to be Dixiecrats in the 60s, and were courted by Nixon's "southern strategy". 

But not only that, I also vote for them because Democrats understand economics and Republicans do not. Whenever Democrats are in office the economy is doing much better. Compare the Clinton era to the Bush era. Republicans do not understand economics. All they understand are tax cuts for the rich.

Democrats also care about infastructure, transportation, renewable energy, the environment, the internet, education, common sense healthcare, and so on.

>You aren't 'better', and democrats often help republican donors achieve their plans through brazen dumbness. 

[False](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2pwhvt/the_differences_between_the_democratic_party_and/). You sound like one of those "BERN IT DOOOWN" false equivalency idiots who is directly responsible for the rise of Trump.

$C: Regardless, he's not wrong that liberal condescension is a huge part of why people like Trump are succeeding on the right at the moment. 
$C: imo your point about the funding coming from a wider variety of sources would actually make it more difficult. In a structure with a group of billionaires you could make a run by convincing a few of them to back you. In a structure where the money comes in smaller amounts from more sources you would have to convince a larger number of people to go against something that has been a core Democratic value for all of recent history.
$C: Honestly mass shootings make up a pretty much nonexistent percent of gun deaths. Australia banned guns to reduce shootings and their murder rates didn't change at all. In fact for a couple years they actually spiked.

$C: You mean the 2014 when congressional republicans refused to extend Obama's payroll tax cut? Because that's what happened in '14. Blue states would have lower taxes if freeloading red states would actually pay their own way. NJ gets less than $.50 back per federal tax dollar, vs "fiscally conservative" states like Alabama take more than $3.00 for every dollar.  You're right, New Jersey spends too much money...on Fed dependent freeloading red states.

$C: > $2500 tax break

Which disappears in 2025 under the Senate bill, while corporations get to keep theirs. Your Social Security will disappear before you get to collect it too, since Republicans will use the deficit that they're exploding as an excuse to cut your future benefits. But people like you can't see past your own nose, so you'll get played by this and vote GOP anyway.
I'll get a break for the first few years too, but I'm smart enough to understand the long con here. A few extra dollars in my pocket now doesn't mean shit when I know these dirtbags are using the deficit  as an excuse to take away my future.
$C: I voted Sanders in the general. Mostly because I'm in a solid blue state. If I wasn't I probably would've voted Clinton, just to get the Orange Fleshlight on his way to an uneventful grave.

Because its about to fucking crash.

Nevermind that the other party wants to regulate the fuck out of everything so that corporations could easily stifle competition (they can pay for additional expenses, smaller firms can't). 

Or the fact that they want to tax the everloving shit out of you. You want it to be like in Europe where government takes more than half of your income and then you have to pray that they actually put it to good use instead of pocketing it for themselves? Do you really trust that your government won't be corrupt?
$C: Such language! Is baby boy upset?
$C: Lets take a look, liberal is accused of child molestation or sexual assault: they are fired, resign, lose their show and are largely held accountable. When a conservative is accused of sexual assualt you make him president or try very hard to get him elected into the Senate.
$C: Are Democrats really acting like they have the moral high ground?

How many hundreds of thousands of dollars did your prostitutes in DC accept from Harvey Weinstein over the years? How many visits to Obama's white house did he have? Everyone and their mother who ever Googled the guy knew he was a sexual predator yet not one Democrat cared until two months ago. 

Moral high ground from a major political party. Great joke!

$C: If you can prove me factually wrong, that obama DID NOT appoint Pai to the FCC, then I’ll admit that I’m wrong. Simply saying someone is wrong because your own opinion is biased is not a healthy way to live, my friend.
$C: I think you're missing my point. I didn't want this. In fact, most of us didn't.  The generalization is not fair to me or many other young americans. I classify my self as a reublican, that doesn't mean I agree with or defend the actions of others in the same party. I hope you understand that.
$C: I guess that's what an "organic takeover" looks like. 
$C: Let's just cut to the the [actual ruling](https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-284286A1.pdf) that came out of this:  

> the Commission concluded that Comcast has unduly interfered with Internet users’ right to access the **lawful** Internet content

That's pretty explicitly saying the opposite of what you are.
$C: Piracy traffic? Since when is Bittorrent just used for Piracy?

$C: You'd know if you clicked the link. It's the paragraph before I quoted.

>The FCC first enacted net-neutrality regulations in 2010 that barred broadband providers from blocking access to any websites or "unreasonably" discriminating against any traffic. Consumer-advocacy groups had hoped for stronger rules, and most of the cable and telecom providers felt the rules were an acceptable compromise.
$C: *Yawn*

$C: Boy, you had him, then you went off the deep end with that comment.

$C: Yes 3-2 I mean anyone could have predicted it. I believe it's going to court. So there's a small window of hope yet. Who knows what will happen yet.
$C: I can see that. We have to exhaust this method first. Next state elections we have to go out in droves. If that doesn’t do something then it’s time for something bigger
$C: > I'm not at all naive, but you are very naive.

Yes, you are. Without regulation you don't magically get more competition. You get just exploited by megacorporation monopolies that could care less about you, in the name of endless profit.

>We have all kinds of regulation, which is how we get monsters like Google and Comcast.

Lack of regulation is what creates monopolies. Regulation is what levels the playing field and gives little guys a chance. If there are no regulations then the monopolies will do whatever they can to prevent the rise of competitors, obviously.

>And you complain, but I bet you let Google intrude in your life in many ways.

False.

$C: so...brain damaged? 
$C: Right, so your brain is damaged lol
$C: Stop saying "literally"
$C: It's one thing to say "We live in a scary time." but "T_D is a national threat that literally murdered someone."?

$C: Or if you got off Donald Trump's dick you may not blindly agree with any person he happens to support. It isn't a coincidence that every person that has responded to me happens to be regular commenters on the /r/The_Donald but I guess it must be because you are all so **woke**.

Linking me several articles is just lazy and I can do the exact same as a counter argument with a [simple google search](https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/19/these-are-the-arguments-against-net-neutrality-and-why-theyre-wrong/).
 Address me with an actual point instead of throwing these at me and there can actually be a discussion.

>You better do it quick tho, before Ajit Pai starts charging you 5 bux per search.

I never claimed the results of this would be to this effect or occur this quickly. But the idea that now ISP's have the ability to do ridiculous things like make certain websites cost more is stupid, even if they don't do it instantly or at all.
$C: Not really in this case.

A pretty extreme example:

>Killing is bad.

The core idea of this is universally agreed but there are some cases where killing might be justifiable.

Similarly,

>Net Neutrality is good

Maybe the laws that enforce it aren't as good as they should be and have negative side effects but the core concept of Net Neutrality is universally agreed to be a good thing. Hell, even people who supported the repeal of Net Neutrality are likely to agree with this.

It isn't like you need to repeal the entire thing when they have the ability to change certain aspects of it.
$C: Dude, what?

1.  I didn't have an "original comment" that you replied to.

2.  I don't think you understand what irony is.
$C: That matters Why? We already know the outcome of it
$C: No one gives a fuck how you identify, boy.
$C: Why not give it a try and let it see play out? Things are clearly not great right now and it's not an irreversible decision. We had it both ways before.
$C: They could before 2 years ago. Just didn't.
$C: Anymore? Can you show me a dollar twitter or reddit has *made*?
$C: Fuck **n o** I didn't. I am so happy Obama's legacy is getting fucking smashed. Long gone are the dreams of federalizing the web and shutting out conservative voices.
$C: You are lumping hundreds of thousands of people together? How is that helping anyone?  
I have found myself talking to brick walls on both sides, lefties and righties, it's not just one group or the other.  
If someone is deleting all the posts a couple hours after writing them, it's fairly safe to assume that person isn't interested in debate and just wants to push an idea/position - it doesn't speak at all to their idea/position and how valid/invalid it is.  
$C: The President himself was taken off Twitter for a while. They also dished out a life time ban to New York Times bestselling author who happens to be a gay, jewish immigrant married to a black man, 'member? Reddit bands entire subreddits using standards that clearly do not apply to others.

ISPs are still not allowed to censor, and I already pay for "faster access" to Youtube, Netflix and HuLu. 

But what is important is that the FTC takes over now, and they look into monopolies.
$C: No, there is no proof of Reddit or twitter silencing conservatives at all oh wait;

$C: Reasonable? That's debatable.

Hear's what one Reddit user had to say about those changes:

*Yea, well by doing so they spit on the fucking grave of the man and the idea which made this place truly a bastion of free flowing information.*

*You know why they veil everything they do? Because they know exactly what would happen if their malfeasance was exposed. They know no one would use the platform. So they trick users, lie, and ban anyone who is in the know that opposes their agenda. Ever wonder why the admins allowed the predditors tumblr to spread (Chen sourced his hit piece from the predditors tumblr) even though mods informed them of it's existence 18 hours before Chen got his grubby hands on the info??? VA knew and they threw him to the dogs to save face for corporate, using SA as a stupid plaything in the process.. https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ptsny/dear_internet_vigilantes_and_lynch_mobs?sort=confidence
No one is saying the reddit admins who use the metasphere to monetize are not intelligent or hard working, I'm just saying they're fucking evil. It's disgusting.*

*Yea, I'm just here to do my part. At the end of the day they created the fucking problem via their detestable payola and they deserve to lose out on any ill gotten gains from the manipulation of the free flow of information.*

*That's the go to excuse for keeping thing hushed about the anti-spam measures. But this wasn't anti-spam. This move was anti-content.*


*TOS and rules of reddit say that bots may not be used to kill content. That's how digg died.*

*Reddit admins can order mods to do things. The longest serving tenured mod can remove all other mods. If third parties are involved it's via one of two mechanism. Firstly, third parties contact mods directly and payola occurds (reddit admins don't like this. Think Ian Chong, Saydrah, and Cinsere.) Or, secondly, the admins have involement with third parties (both internal and external) who then issue marching orders to mods of the largest subs. Perhaps emplying them as contractors with NDA's involved? Who knows.*

*Multiple perspectives on a given issue provide the tools necessary to escape the perils of media bias. Reddit and sites like it must be protected from those who seek to contort the medium for their own ends.*

*To protect aggregates is to always expose this type of censorship when it occurs. Force those who forsake their sworn duty in the furtherance of personal satisfaction, to answer for their sordid deeds in the most public of forums.*

$C: That's not what Net Neutrality means. 
$C: > spez claims to care about neutrality. Does that neutrality

No offence mate, but if you use the word neutrality in a thread on the topic of net neutrality, getting surprised because people assumed you were talking about the topic at hand is a bit stupid.

No shit people thought you're neutrality meant net neutrality.

Here's an idea, edit your comment to make it clear.
$C: >I can not

"I did not use a contraction so therefore I am smart."
$C: What? No offense meant, it's just that I should have ignored your comment as pointless blathering instead of trying to correct what looked like a misunderstanding. Feel free to return to blathering, I'll leave you to it. :)
$C: It wasn’t good to begin with.
$C: Thanks, I sure try my hardest, because I know it's hard for people like you to understand.
$C: I don't give a fuck who was doing what. I actually know what net neutrality is. I actually know the history of this issue. I have come to the conclusion, given the facts, along with the majority of this country, that repealing net neutrality is an assault on free speech. Go suck off Dear Leader in your safe space.
$C: You’re stupid. I’m neither redneck nor Christian. You can’t just say because you had a bad time that everyone else does. If it’s as bad as you say, no one would live here except racist nazis.

Honestly, the fact that TD hasn't been banned completely is a fucking miracle.  It's one thing to not notice that your subscribers are getting nuttier and the rhetoric getting more angry, but to then not only *not do anything about it* after an innocent gets murdered, but actually suppress the information is all kinds of wronged up.
$C: In your own screenshot, you dunce.
$C: Disguising abuse as "just an opinion" is incredibly disingenuous and you know it. 
$C: Okay? I don't know what that has to do with you not knowing what you're talking about. 
$C: Why? He is not an isp, also he knows what nn is. You don't
$C: You don't get why completely uneducated and nonsensical "criticisms" are not worth of a response other than "that's not what NN means"? It's like you morons are living in opposite world.
$C: Proof? He did only on one occasion to fuck with you guys after calling him a pedo multiple times, apologized and never did that again
$C: Except I wasn't wrong, you were just upset that Reddit is hypocritical 
$C: Yeah but how will you survive in the future without your fake internet popularity points?
$C: Maybe you should try posting some facts then.
$C: Agreed, downvotes are essentially upvotes in certain subs
$C: Hey, hypocrisy is an argument on its own.
$C: The irony
$C: Buried? That's not what NN is you moron.... 
$C: That's retarded. 
$C: I feel like we're done with the hivemind though.  It implies that users typically think the same and vote the same.  Organically coalescing into some powerful swarm.

Ever since spez ~~rigged~~ fixed the algorithm and classified it, it's more likely the admins curate content rather than users...
$C: There are more people in Western society now that depend on the internet for their way of life than people who rely on it for entertainment.  This includes me and my wife, whose work is centered around the internet.  Our situation also does not lend us to competition with several ISPs; we have one that we can use, and it's Charter/Spectrum.  We don't have a choice but to pay for internet, and this is the case for a very large portion of our country at least.  At this stage in civilization, the internet is a utility for the majority of us.
$C: wait so aren't you getting fiesty that you can't accept better over time and you want it to stay what it is and no i don't work for the FCC or Verizon worst case scenario you pay 3$ more for a few years then it gets repealed and nothing changes 
$C: Kill yourself, paedophile-lover
$C: I'd wish the same on you, but your Korean pecker is too tiny to fuck anything lol
$C: Prob someone who believes hate speech has no space on reddit
$C: Well if this affects the internet in a very negative way, we'll know who to thank.

You're really telling me this opportunity to make more money for charging for websites won't eventually happen? Just seems like blind faith in the honor system
$C: Think about it. So repealing title 2 will offer slow and fast lanes for a price, right? If say your favorite streaming company thats currently free cannot operate a business model with this. What will they do? They will offer a fee for their service or cease to exist. 

Thats how i see it. And how i see many small internet companies going under because of it. 
$C: Of course repealing it isn't in the platform.  You think they would actually put "repeal the 2nd Amendment" in their platform?  They would never win another election.  They don't call it "repeal the 2nd Amendment", they instead use the misleading catch phrase "common sense gun regulation".  It's a neat trick because "common sense" can mean anything to anyone, but to the majority of the Democrats "common sense" means "legislating the 2nd Amendment out of existence"
$C: man its like we are talking about the repeal of the obama-era net neutrality rules or something. THAT WAS LITERALLY WHAT THE FCC VOTED ON AND WHAT THE POST IS ABOUT.  Jesus maybe keep your cock in your mouth instead of your hand might save you the embarrassment. 
$C: Stop trying to act black you fucking transracial cracker.  It’s pathetic.

Edit: These down votes sure is surprising how many people are completely uneducated on this subject. No wonder our government is as incompetent as it is. 
$C: So you're okay with monopolies and corporations sucking every dime out of hardworking Americans who have no other options in their area. 

Cool.
$C: >  My tax dollars shouldn't go toward providing people with internet access.  

I'm ignorant to this, how are tax dollars paying for internet?

>It's not a necessity. 

Bold statement to make while online

$C: It literally is a necessity in today's world. It's where you do the research necessary to pass high school or university. It's where you go to find job offers and apply for work. It's how you keep up with current events, including emergency information. It's how you communicate with your friends and family and know what is going on in your social circles.

The long and short of it is: Internet access absolutely *is* a necessity in modern developed societies.
$C: While I'd normally agree with you, it would take years, maybe even decades, to establish enough competition to make sure this actually wouldn't happen, especially if we didn't declare the internet a utility. Would take a long time for other ISPs to cover the country several more times over to adequately serve every location with competition, right?
$C: Free markets only work in industries where the barriers to entry are low.

ISPs are inherently not such an industry. Just like any significant infrastructure, the costs of rolling them out are *enormous*, and so there will inherently only be a small number of players, even without any regulation getting in the way. But then, of course, there *are* regulations that make it even harder to get involved. At the most extreme, the existing major ISPs have lobbied to make it illegal in many areas for local municipalities to install their own public Internet.

But regardless of the reasons for it, the fact is that currently there is very limited selection of ISPs, with the vast majority of Americans having just one or two options. In that scenario, a regulation that exists purely to make sure all data is treated equally simply makes sense. It's not about government "having control", it's just making sure things are treated the same. Not so different from governments requiring public roads be able to take cars regardless of who is driving or what brand of car they prefer.
$C: The article you linked explicitly states it doesn't harm small ISPs...

I can understand a removal of some regulations, like filing fees and other stuff like that, but a full-scale repeal? Your own source completely disputes that

$C: The internet has been commonly called the information highway. It is essentially a road to many sources of information. Would you not be pissed off if the owners of roads could say that we will build a wall blocking off your business from our road unless you pay us millions?
$C: How am i denying that what you're implying is Russia cares and somehow its their fault net neutrality is being repealed you hate the country so much you blame everything on them because you can't accept not having hostile relations the only time you would is if it was still the Soviet Union which would fit your political agenda

<citation conveniently missing>
$C: Yes it does. Like most people who didn't bother to do any research, you weren't trying to falsely imply that ISPs were doing anything bad before net neutrality. It was only getting worse right up until it passed which is we got it to begin with.

And oh ya I guess I did meet with a Russian but that was the only meeting. Oh ok fine those 2 were the only times. Ugh no I can't recall that one lol". 

Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign manager, was a paid operative of a Russia-linked political party in Ukraine.

In June 2016, Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort met with a Russian operative who promised them dirt on Clinton. What exactly would you call that?

"Trump's eldest son exchanged private messages with WikiLeaks during the presidential campaign at the same time the website was publishing hacked emails from Democratic officials, according to correspondence made public Monday. Donald Trump Jr. did not respond to many of the notes, which were sent using the direct message feature on Twitter. But he alerted senior advisers on his father's campaign, including his brother-in-law, Jared Kushner, according to two people familiar with the exchanges.

"In the messages, WikiLeaks urged Trump Jr. to promote its trove of hacked Democratic emails and suggested that President Trump challenge the election results if he did not win, among other ideas. They were first reported by the Atlantic and later posted by Trump Jr. on Twitter."

Trump hired Roger Stone and Paul Manafort, the guys who invented our crony lobyist system in the late 70's early 80's that Trump so honesty detests. Trump only said he wasn't bought out AFTER the supposed best dealmaker couldn't close with some of Jeb Bush's donors. If you aren't some Russian troll, fuck you're dumb.

From your source, 

>"We've seen direct construction costs climb by over 30 percent," Wilson said, "and a lot of that is directly attributed to what builders are having to pay their subs and trades in wages." 

So the costs of construction has gone up 30%.. a "lot" of that, is due to labor shortages. You realize who has to pay for that difference right? You.. the person buying the house. The top level people aren't taking a pay hit for this...

And 30% in construction costs is a fucking far cry from "wages have climbed 30%"..

$C: > Sorry for wanting to prevent 10 year old girls from being raped.

LMFAO - Point to the one case of a shitty person that happens to be trans that you can scrape up.  Okay

You realize that we've all been sharing restrooms with transpeople FOR FUCKING EVER, right?  Guess what, it seems that it's not been an issue until some scared little bitch decided to make it a legislative issue... cuz muh jesus or some such shit.


$C: Yes, you build the wall to keep out the colored child rapists, and work to get the white child rapist a seat in the Senate 

Haha! Like you give a fuck.

Are you even reading your own sources, jackass?

"Wilson claims that sort of shortage can add a month or two to the time it takes to build a home. 

But apart from higher prices and inconvenience to consumers, Marek said the worker shortage is a drag on the economy, keeping the recovery from going full throttle. Marek said he is turning down projects for lack of workers."

$C: After endorsing moore no one believes you want to fight pedophiles tbh
$C: How about the plans of selling public land and the building of the keystone pipeline. Not to mention the annulment of the Paris Accord.

Trump is bad for the future of our planet.
$C: Surely no one would be raped if we left the magic gender forcefields on the bathrooms.
$C: No, it dates back to the Cold War:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism
$C: Well, its the best they can do. 
$C: I never said that. Please don't put words into my mouth.

I knew someone would reply with this though. It's the same black and white thinking as *if you're not with me, your against me.* That accusation is right out of the pro-establishment/corporate dems social media manipulation playbook. 

I must think they're equal because I dare to criticize the left for its bullshit, right? Don't be ridiculous.
$C: Well, that's just not good enough. You can't just claim that the mods of a sub have been bought, even citing a specific $ value, and then back it up with "it's so obvious I shouldn't have to prove it". That's childish and stupid, which coincidentally makes for a great fit in that sub.

I'm well aware that there's a constant war between the political "left" and the political right on Reddit, with both sides spamming the other with downvotes, exaggerations and lies just to "win". This is why the content on /r/politics is strictly "liberal" if sorted by "best" or "top" and far-right if you sort by "controversial" - the "left" simply outnumbers the right here on Reddit. Similarly, subs not often frequented by "liberals", like /r/conspiracy, have been colonized by users from t_d and similar subs.

I didn't automatically believe the Steele Dossier when it surfaced, just as I don't take anything backed up by nothing for granted as the truth. No one should, yet almost EVERYONE on this site are. Both sides think they're better than the other and that *they*
 are the smart and enlightened ones, looking down at the mewling curs that dare oppose their grand intellect and infinite wisdom.

Either post some proof or believable indication of your claim or get the fuck back to your hole.

$C: Y'know, saying "even if I posted proof you wouldn't believe it" is actually even less likely to convince people than posting proof they disagree with.
$C: Those videos are stupid. In the first one it clearly showed that he couldn't post because he didn't subscribe to the sub. 

The person who made the video then doesn't understand why archive.org would be listed as a rehosting site.  
$C: I agree, Donnie or some of his affiliates (Russians?) bought at least a couple mod spots.  That is what you're talking about, right? 
$C: Ah, gotcha. Always surprised me how many stupid fucking people were willing to believe random shit from 4chan.
$C: You're brainwashed

[Uranium One is  bullshit](https://youtu.be/QZAQZufnjIQ) and the [dossier was originally  paid for by conservatives](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/27/conservative-website-funded-initial-fusion-gps-trump-opposition-effort.html)

Congrats

You fucked yourself

Hope you like paying extra to go to wallow in shit at  the_Senile  
$C: Why 10 minutes arbitrarily based on your popularity rather than your actions? Would it be that hard to actually moderate a sub instead of imposing arbitrary limits based on popularity? Isn't this whole announcement and campaign about not limiting information/data based on its source, but rather allowing the free flow of information. It's extremely hypocritical.
$C: Yep. LOL
$C: It couldn't get any worse than it is. The only way to fix that is to eject from social media all together. That is never going to happen though because people are to obsessed with themselves and the validation of others. Social media has become a toxic cesspool of narcissism, misinformation, and propaganda. It is great for business and staying in touch but the positives just don't outweigh the negatives. Net neutrality hasn't stopped any of this, I'm not sure that you can.

$C: Or maybe people see through your lies and you get called out for it... like you are a dishonest liar and a troll.
$C: Ah, Trumptards are doing a trolling spree? Sad that you're so braindead you don't realize this is bad for you.
$C: Why are you guys triggering yourselves? You are a vast minority now, you should stick together. (Protop: high school is not a job)
$C: i thought child labour was illegal?
$C: Shhh, what would he know about an honest day's pay? That freeloading slactivist redditor cunt needs to take his ass back to /r/politics
$C: Your time spent on Reddit is what I meant when I said Reddit life.  If you’re posting new content to t_d daily, then it’s sweeping into your real life as well.
$C: They don’t work, so they assume no one else works.

Part time minimum wage jobs don’t count cucks ;)
$C: In this case words means he can't even make a casino stay afloat. Sad!
$C: Pretty sure it's twice a day.
$C: Yes, we do. We know Soros and the Clintonistas spend [millions](https://www.thedailybeast.com/hillary-pac-spends-dollar1-million-to-correct-commenters-on-reddit-and-facebook) on "correcting the record" on the internet with astro turfing.



>Citing “lessons learned from online engagement with ‘Bernie Bros,’” a pro-Hillary Clinton Super PAC is pledging to spend $1 million to “push back against” users on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and Instagram.

>Correct the Record’s “Barrier Breakers” project boasts in a press release that it has already “addressed more than 5,000 people that have personally attacked Hillary Clinton on Twitter.” The PAC released this on Thursday.


**LOL** BERNIE CAN STILL WIN!


$C: LOL im the one shaking in a thread about Obama's legacy getting cuck smashed LOLOLOL cry for the mods to come save you faggot

$C: You should make that more bold and maybe add a caps lock, that's the only way I can really understand you.

As far as the ISPs stealing the internet.. I never said that. And I think that's what's referred to as *hyperbole* and just because you don't quite grasp that concept doesn't mean anyone's being deceitful. 
$C: Tell me why Comcast would claim they'd never throttle internet connections to certain websites or connections [when they've been caught in the past doing the same](https://web.archive.org/web/20171214201925/https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5n8z88/megathread_intelligence_report_claims_russia_has/dc9t7cw/?st=jb6xh3zq&sh=f00ffe4c). Tell me why they've lobbied so hard to get it removed if it doesn't incredibly benefit them to do so.
$C: If you support the DNC then you support sexual harassers, corrupt politicians, antifa.

You know how stupid that sounds?
$C: I'm not a registered GOP voter, but something tells me you're a real political party kinda guy 
$C: Please do something, see how it goes. If you respond violently to poking and prodding you deserve the fate that will be inevitable should you participate in a revolution of any sort.
$C: It 150% is a partisan issue
$C: You're right, but if you think this of all issues is the one worth revolting over, you're a delusional leftist.
$C: Lol so you're comparing yourselves the the Germans right before they commit genocide. Makes sense honestly
$C: You didn't have to. Peace among worlds, rick
$C: Lol if you're about to exercise the 2nd because of the *internet being deregulated* you deserve the bullet the US military is going to put in your head
$C: You literally just proved the opposite... You have to be a troll.. no one is this stupid not on purpose. 
$C: "Muh Russia"

lol delusional
$C: Well to be fair, "soon" is a relative term. Tomorrow? No. In the next decade? Oh, absolutely. If you think Comcast and co. isn't chomping at the bit for this sort of thing, I don't know what to tell you other than to maybe hit up a library to catch up since you've come out from under that rock in the last twenty minutes.
$C: 1488 is a white nationalist symbol. 14 stands for the 14 words. 88 stands for HH, which stands for Heil Hitler. 
$C: What’s so hard to understand about not advocating for the deaths of people? 

Your individual comment won’t be used, sure. But you ignored my actual point there. No matter what your political views are, hoping that people are murdered is not the way to go about enacting change, it’s just an easy way to make yourself and your cause look terrible.
$C: You are so weird.  I dont wear a black mask.  I am not a Communist. I don't *like* Communism.  I am not a Jew. 

Are you writing this from a care facility of some kind?  I would find you so much easier to understand if I knew you were unstable somehow.

Otherwise I just have to believe you are really *really* stupid.

$C: I mean with regard to discussions here, not the net neutrality 
$C: I mean, his account's only 2 months old, and he's got a whole anti-NN subreddit, is spamming/trolling, and has a shitton of karma.

Something's rotten. If he's not on the take, then he's just an asshole. Which, somehow, is worse. Just indepedently behaving like garbage without being paid for it.
$C: Lol
$C: I get your arguments and while your reasoning is logical, I don't think you're looking at it correctly. Here's why:

I think that the internet is, or is getting to the point of where it's as big as banks are. If you remember 2008 you'll remember banks being saved by governments. The reason for that was banks being too big to fail, which was horrendous but true. The reason for that is because banks had tremendous amounts of freedom that led to terrible products such as the subprime mortgages which subsequently led to the crash of the banking system and the entire world economy. As I said, I think that the internet is at the same point or will get to that point or possibly surpass it.

Your reasoning for why free markets can improve ISPs is absolutely fair and I agree. However, my issue is not with ISPs becoming better, my issue is with the integrity of the web as a whole and the importance of it to the world economy. That is why I believe that, unlike what happened to the banking system, governments should stay in control. The internet is simply too big to fail. An inherent problem with free markets is the tendency to crash, partially or completely, and I believe that we should not risk the web to improve ISP internet prices or web speed for individuals. We should learn from what happened to the banking system in 2008.
$C: Explain it to me. 
$C: And surprise! It has nothing to do with NN.
$C: 19 hours later...comment's still there.

[Archived for posterity.](http://archive.fo/vmaW2)
$C: actually Trump had more people with college degrees vote for him look it up
$C: Democrats traditionally win the majority of the least educated demographic, 'highschool education or less.'
$C: It also shows that the majority of mentally ill people vote republican... oh wait no it's the other way around.
$C: The Internet is also more than the hardware that supports it, but I don't expect you to understand that. 
$C: Facebook, twitter, and reddit are in no way monopolies. They do not have a monopoly on the infrastructure, land, and service coverage for massive regions in the US like Comcast and Verizon do. 

People use facebook because they want to. Many people purchase Comcast subscriptions because they have no other choice. That's the difference.
$C: [deleted]
$C: You're not being censored, if you were being censored, none of your comments would even exist on this website. 

Other than that, that doesn't sound like an argument, you sound like you're saying censorship is good. I certainly don't agree. Internet in this age is very nearly a necessity, and allowing ISPs to control what content we see is an objectively bad decision to make.
$C: Because those are clearly the same thing. Right.
$C: My water company doesn't charge me more based on what type of water.  

You're really moving the goalposts from the original point of the discussion, but with such a crap policy to defend, I guess that's the only way?  Peace.
$C: Sure why not, if it is cheaper than paying a flat rate I would rather choose to be build per GB.
$C: Maybe next I’ll put it in a meme for you 
$C: Your loss
$C: You're not reading his rant because you revel in being misinformed and crying your eyes out all over Reddit with childish, thoughtless, pathetic one-liners because you don't even know what you're arguing in favor of.
$C: They could have made a campaign for fucking Harambe and he would have done better than Hillary at least Bernie had a message Hillary had nothing but her old stink tank the one her husband is trying to escape and i don't blame him
$C: You should look and realize how much things are shifting thanks to Trump and the Republican failures. Public opinion is definitely changing. Calm down mate. Remain civil and hope for a better tomorrow.
$C: Yet they have bots....
$C: http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/028/130/0bd.jpg

$C: I don't see how allowing Major ISP's to slow down or block sites they don't like allows small ISP start ups to flourish. Wouldn't they slow down or block sites that argue for easier access to set up an ISP in competition to them?   Not ALL Regulation is bad, and I think that is the trap you are falling into here.  Yes, we should eliminate regulation that has been purchased to help the filthy rich, but Net Neutrality is the opposite of that.
$C: >  Technically, I am paying them by consuming their ads

Technically, you aren't because you aren't losing money in doing so.
$C: I don't care about your thoughts and views, I was stating a fact that NN will most affect sites in the shit tier of the Internet. Sites like Twitter, gooogle, etc will all be fine. It will be competitors that will suffer if Comcast starts demanding payments like they did with Netflix. 
$C: Are you not aware that /r/the_donald bans people for having different views than them? An eye for an eye retard.
$C: Covfefe
$C: It's good that comcast screw you over so they can get more money out of reddit and google? What if they don't pay and then reddit takes 5 min to load the front page for you? anything goes now
$C: All bytes should be treated equally. There, that was easy. 
$C: From what Im reading charge for access can be more of an issue with the repeal of NN. Also how will this stop ISPs from suing other up-and-coming ISPs from opening their lines near or around existing ISP lines? Everytime a company like google tries to open internet lines in my area they get sued to infinity thus making it impossible. How does this change with the repeal? Im not arguing im genuinely curious on why some people dont want NN. 
$C: Which is my point. No one voted for Pai, he was appointed. That’s not democracy.
$C: That's bureaucracy for you. That's the long and short of it though. It protects you from ISPs regulating what you have access to.
$C: Am i annoying because i said the truth and it triggers you if you post something so disgusting and expect no backlash go comment on THE_Clinton or some shit 
$C: No way. ISPs could already throttle. ISPs will now offer slow and fast lanes. If internet companies cannot afford they wont exist. 

Plus there already consumer protections on the internet from title 1. Title 2 was simply government overreach. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Cool, insult me, all it shows is that you don't actually have a real response.
$C: Yeah man I'm getting paid by a nazi. Not like the president endorses those or anything. Why don't you crawl back into your slimy
little whole, you pathetic human being.
$C: Comcast throttled people in 2007, at&t imposed secrete fees between 2011 and 2014 and Comcast AGAIN tried in 2016 while NN was in place. And those were only noticed when a formal suit was placed, God only knows what happened behind the scenes.

Get real dude, once it's gone every major isp will impose fees because it's the smart business modal thing to do and without net neutrality protecting us it becomes a winner take all over the internet.

Ur argument that it never happened so it won't happen now is a joke
$C: Uh, you couldn't be more wrong. Google has always paid more for their connection because it has to be fast to handle all of their data. NN means your ISP can't screw with it on your end.
$C: Your concerned about porn and social media. You realize the internet as a utility is used for free commerce. Not to even touch on how controlling having certain companies choosing what you see and can even access. Your talking about full blown political propaganda going to the highest bidder. How are people this stupid? 
$C: Well, glad we agreed that your ADHD was cured by a dietary change, and not porn.
$C: [removed]
$C: In metropolitan areas we are limited to 1 or 2 options... Most of the times it's 1.

How is this free market?
$C: How? What part of this bills repel will increase competition?
$C: It sounds like you're not really aware of what all this means. Small businesses are, in some ways, the most at risk here. Here's an article from the Harvard Business Review. 

https://hbr.org/2017/12/what-small-businesses-stand-to-lose-in-a-net-neutrality-rollback

This vote makes no sense, aims to achieve nothing,  and is the biggest threat to small businesses and lower income folks. A free and open market is the absolute last thing on the FCCs mind. You've been duped.


$C: LMAO, so the larger corporations can continue blocking expanding your infrastructure like they did to Google.

The market is anything but free.
$C: Hey man, I applaud you for taking the karma hit. You commented your opinion in a decent manner and gave clear answers to everyone's questions. You really shouldn't be down voted to hell based on a minority opinion. I was initially for NN but it drug on so long that I got sick of seeing everywhere. Now I wanna see it fail in a "watch the world burn" type of thing on Reddit. I make decent income, I'll pay whatever I need to for internet. Anyways, thanks for sticking to your guns.
$C: You keep gargling that up... but you've yet to actually explain how local municipalities who are under monopoly are actually going to have an increase in competition.

I'm just assuming at this point you're a fucking moron that can't see further than the end of your nose (like a lot of the Trump supporters on this website).
$C: I mean it seems to have worked out pretty well seeing as we have cool things like the iphone nowadays.
$C: Ah, yes. I really should have shouldn’t I? But it’s a nice paying job and it supports my hobbies well. However, if boycotting was actually effective we wouldn’t be here right now have this exchange now would we? 

Also you should probably learn how having responsibilities work. You can just up and move anytime and whenever. 
$C: 1st. I don't have options other than Comcast so I cant boycott them
2nd. ISPs have demonstrated great reluctance to improve service for financial benefit when WE gave them 400 billion to create national fiber internet.
3rd if ISPs control the internet, smaller service providers will simply be blocked.
4th its very hard to break up monopolies when "anti-government" republicans support citizens united.
5th Companies like Google will soon be rich enough to buy out the United States, imagine that, Google is your new government, except it doesn't hold elections and is in no way responsible to the people. The point of a successful government is to allow people to control their own lives (elections and stuff), so instead of giving all the power to private companies, lets focus on creating a government that actually puts our interest first.  
$C: But in my area (and many others) there is only one option. There is no way to switch, and laws are in place to stop people from creating their own isps. There is no way around it for me.


>One way we will hold back progress is to mandate that only one entity is allowed to administer or oversee administration of goods and services.

What do you think repealing net neutrality is doing? All your argument amounts to is [At least it's not the government!](https://i.imgur.com/dfGXwCx.jpg)

$C: Nice strawman
$C: Go ahead and check my post history. How many posts have I made about NN in the last year?

I'm pretty sure it's 0.

I'd go check your post history, but I'd rather not see tons of posts of hairy guys sucking each other's cocks.
$C: Also, since you decided to selectively omit this section: "He has served in various positions at the FCC since being appointed to the commission by President Barack Obama in May 2012"
$C: I'm not blaming Obama. I voted for Obama. I'm just correcting the guy that said Pai is doing what those who appointed him wanted him to do. Pretty sure Obama wouldn't want a repeal of net neutrality.
$C: Don't earn money? You mean become a poor person? That doesn't sound like a fun time with how the leaders in government treat poor people. 
$C: Wait, you believe Ajit Pai's narrative? He's offered no evidence whatsoever that this actually benefits anyone but ISPs. I didn't realize anyone still bought his snake oil.
$C: you'll def enjoy when you'll have to pay 1$ to watch a YT video. Not from the US, enjoy the shithole you've digged.
$C: You know what's weird? When the Dem's were in charge, we got Net Neutrality. 

WEIRD. 

And now that they're not... we're losing it. 

WEIRD.

Yeah that totally means they're the same and the Dem's would have taken it away... after they gave it to us... for some reason...

Where do you seriously get this shit from?
$C: Fuck off with that "both sides are the same" dogshit. 

Republicans have wanted to get rid of Net Neutrality since it was enacted. 
$C: SURPRISE!!! Conservative has no fucking clue what he's talking about. Shocker!
$C: No, we should let the FCC keep free reign to fuck us over as they please. Yeah, that's worked real well...
$C: |REEEEEEE people will rape and kill if you don't give them 10mbps

Just so that you get a grip of what you're talking about. I first got 10 mbps in around 1995-2000.
My current DL speed is at 300 mbps, for about $50 a month. I could get a much faster connection if I want to, I think the most my current provider can offer is around 1000 mbps for like $100 a month.
And I have like 6 providers to choose from, so if my provider did anything I didn't like I would change in a heartbeat.


We have less people in jail, less poor people, better school results, better healthcare for the average citizen, we're happier, better paid. Things that US has more of is: Opioid addicts, victims in terrorist attacks, shooting, police violence, rich people fucking over everyone else.

I'm happy here, thanks.
$C: I mean to be fair (and not to get into a debate), Hillary is just a different side of the same coin. I feel like either way we would have been pretty fucked, just in different ways. The problem is that people keep voting these corporate shills into office instead of people that genuinely want to make a difference. People believe every god damn word that they’re told on TV and don’t have an ounce of will to be informed.  Things aren’t going to change until people care as much about their government and their country’s well being as they do about the latest Kardashian trends.
$C: This far predates Trump and Hillary.

The long march towards a second gilded age began with the demonization of the progressive left in the 50's and 60's, culminating with their exile from Democratic Party politics in the wake of the McGovern Comission in 1968. Its impossible to overstate just how pivotal that comission was (and by extension the '68 election) in the course of modern american politics. The new deal era was effectively over.
$C: Gtfo and let the old people die in their retarded dualistic world. I can't wait to see this rotten political landscape finally collapse. 
$C: Fuck off ya twit 
$C: Yes, I too am economically illiterate. 
$C: The internet must've been really bad before 2015 when the policy was put in place
$C: [deleted]
$C: Yes, and then I read more.  Even his wiki states has was nominated to the FCC to fill a republican seat in 2011, and then nominated as chairman in 2017 by Trump.  Stop reposting pro- Trump bullshit.  
$C: from what I've seen, /r/libertarian
$C: Yeah I just edited my comment, my comments section was being weird but when I went back to it it was right. Sorry about that. 
$C: Hmm... perhaps it's a joke that got recycled a few times. Didn't see the roast.

$C: good bot
$C: Coming soon: Comcast Facebook Pro access package for only $39.95/mo!
$C: Jesus Christ
$C: So? You can fill applications without gigabet internet. You don't even need broadband to do that hell you could do that with dial-up.

People using the net and companies who built on another structure don't get to whine when the property they built against changes.  You aren't entitled to a platform on private companies services.

Your profile has no right to go online neither does anyone managing their finances.
$C: And freedom of companies to make competing services. 

The real problem isn't whether the internet is federally regulated (it should not be). 

The problem is local/state-level policies that result in monopoly scenarios in which ISPs get act like shits and get no consequences. 


$C: All of those nightmare scenario memes are fallacious, and based off of how Portuguese mobile internet service plans work, not home-based service. 
$C: The Room is the best movie ever
$C: No, but I support small government and as little regulation as possible when it comes to private industry. 

I also do not at all like the idea of the federal government having an iota of weight to throw behind what kind of content can and cannot be shown on the internet, or what kind of sites can be accessed. 

NN was the first brick towards building the Great Firewall of America. 

ISPs may act like shits, but they are subject to market forces, and, if we are lucky, local/state regulations will be relaxed so we do not have regional ISP monopolies anymore. 

It is not nearly as easy, if even possible, to fight back against systematic government oversight and control over the flow of information.

Look up the Countering Information Warfare Act of 2016. It was silently slipped into a military budget bill on Obama's 11th hour.

Here's a TLDR of how it works together with NN to create the possibility of complete federal control of internet traffic and content: 

https://i.4cdn.org/pol/1513233742005.png
$C: Were you able to do that before December 2015? Yes? Good news! You’ll continue to be able to do it from now on too!
$C: Of course, my town in Illinois is too small to matter. 
$C: I live in Houston but thankfully San Antonio and Austin aren't far whenever I'm ready to move out from here.
$C: Now i feel bad for correcting you
$C: I agree completely with your second paragraph about needing more local competition. That is the true solution for average consumers. 

Regarding states being able to make their own net neutrality laws. Sure I guess? The problem with that is - how do you enforce them? Based on the registered address of the ISP? The physical location of their servers? What about ISPs with service in multiple states? What about wireless (satellite) providers?

My above criticism was based on your statement “Mississippi should not have an equal voice to California when deciding the future of the internet”. 

That just sounds partisan and exclusionary. But now I think it was just poorly worded for what you actually wanted to say. 

If you are simply saying “California should be able to regulate ISPs inside state borders however it sees fit”, then I have no immediate problem with that. Nor do I think there is anything preventing California making such laws right now. 

Ironically it would probably push the tech industry away from the California-centric shape it has now. 

Competition is always a good thing. 
$C: The romans abided by and feared the mob. Sic semper tyrannis, thus always to tyrants.
$C: LET'S GET THE BASTARDS!
$C: I will say, this does lend great clarity to the current inequality and corruption of the rich in this country.
$C: They don't care about protesters, Americans, or our democracy. That's pretty clear. 
$C: They are fucking with the very thing that keeps people complacent. What do you expect people to do.
$C: Some people deserve the violence brought upon them. Go around being a piece of shit doesn't lend itself towards making friends. I'm shocked the dude can go out safely in public to be honest.
$C: I'm certainly not going to encourage violence against any particular person for any particular act, but your argument isn't realistic.  

If a job becomes dangerous enough, eventually nobody will want to do it, no matter what it pays.  

Also, violence adds credibility, not removes it.  Things are always taken more seriously when they're backed by violence.  It's why nuclear ICBMs are so important to North Korea.

It's (arguably )why the 2nd amendment exists.

edit: Please note again that this is in no way meant to encourage anyone to take any sort of violent action.  Rather, I simply wanted to note that violence has always been an effective tool whenever there's a disagreement.
$C: The difference is he allowed himself to be a puppet. He's not being controlled by anyone.
$C: I agree that it isn't right to target his kids.  But it's also pretty predictable that it's happening.  He put a target on his whole family's back.  
$C: Nothing is going to happen
$C: opening up the market making more options  ending monopolies isn't protecting the consumers so wait do you want to do nothing and drop the thing he has been trying to pass for years and years no you would have done the same the Man is being attacked not the ISPS which is disgusting what do you want him to do resign stop in the middle of passing a law that has been tried to be reinplemented since 2015 you know because the internet was so terrible before  then right?!!!/1?!??1?????/?/?
$C: Man, I really think we should change the speed limit for this one street.  Let's throw out all our heavy-handed traffic regulations until that can be fixed!
$C: Passing a bill like that isn't even guaranteed..

So in this analogy, you also don't have the money to afford a new mattress, so you just threw out your old one before you were sure you could get a new one. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Nice. This pleases me. 
$C: But what if your principle is literally "people should not be harassed, except if they're harming humanity"? Then you are not abandoning them.

Principles are not disallowed from being qualified.
$C: can a german person please help invent a new word for this situation
$C: I got banned for politely pointing out that a user was posting incorrect information about net neutrality. 
$C: I've gotten some pretty hard pushback when I've written "naïve" and "naïveté". Some think it looks pretentious, but I most certainly don't intend it to be that way. 
$C: Because they made it that way. The reason it isn't a partisan issue is because it affects us all. They will feel the hurt and will have an anuerism trying to rationalize why they supported the wrong team.
$C: Right.  It's only been ~25 years.  I mean there was a period between the mid 90s and 2004 where there weren't really any policies in place, but this was also the first 10 years where the Internet was a common household fixture.  Shit was still pretty new and in growth mode.  NN wasn't really an issue yet for either side.

 The next 10 years we saw the Internet hit its stride.  There was more movement in both directions and court battles as providers established themselves... culminating in the 2014 Verizon case and the following Obama FCC policy.

This is still a new fight. 
$C: Your insults reveal your insecurities. You're right, though. There was a time period before 2015 when net neutrality regulations weren't required to keep the net neutral.  That's just the way it was.  Partly because it was new.  Partly because providers wanted some regulatory assurances before changing that.

What has changed, I wonder?  A lot.  But it's incredibly naive to think that doing away with NN will magically return us to pre-NN de facto neutrality when NN itself is a reaction to providers trying to change that very thing.
$C: Wow I've never met a 10 year old with a CCNP. That must be a world record right?
$C: For some people it's something they say to feel smarter like "I'm not one of those shills, I'm in the center, I have my own beliefs" for others, though, it's to make the GOP look not as bad in comparison. 
$C: In some respects I think they're both bad, but the Republicans are clearly worse.

$C: I think a lot of people think that both having faults implies that they're both just as bad.
$C: It's lazy cynicism that frees them from the hard work of actually evaluating the difference between things.  Anyone can simply offer this pithy nonsense without actually knowing anything about either party, and they like to pretend that hating both means they're not being manipulated by either, despite the fact that the GOP fucking **loves** when people repeat the idea that all their bullshit is just politics as usual.  It normalizes it, which is why Republicans answer every criticism with some fictional scenario where Democrats supposedly did the same thing, instead of trying to defend their actions on their own merits.
$C: Neither are good, but the Republicans are demonstrably worse.

Unfortunately both sides are corrupt to some degree. It's a "lesser of two evils" situation. We deserve better :(
$C: They aren't the same and people who say they are, are either maliciously trying to muddy the waters, or stupid as fuck 
$C: from an independent perspective (I am an American independent voter, no party affiliation and voted Johnson in 2016), the RNC seems to be hard asses and the DNC seems to be gullible. Both are conspiratorial, power hungry and lying mass manipulators. Their candidates ALWAYS reflect their qualities and walk party line regardless of what citizens in their areas of all political affiliations, whom they must represent equally, want. Shit, not even the merit of a bill is considered frequently, only whether it fits with party doctrines. The divide created by this polarized two party system is slowly turning our political system into the Israel-Palestine conflict.
$C: Dane here, and I feel the same. I mean, we have some funky politicians but nothing like I see in America.

To be fair, a large part of my knowledge of American politics comes from The Daily Show and similar, and that is obviously aimed for a democratic audience. Other than Fox news, are there other TV outlets or shows in America that are anti-democrat? 
$C: [Not for lack of trying](https://thetylerloop.com/is-louie-gohmert-unbeatable/), but when your district seat has less than 100k population and 15% of them attend the same megachurch where your rep gets up and gives speeches we're a bit SOL. I'll vote against him if I'm still here next year, and he'll probably get 70% of the vote again anyway. 
$C: Exactly. They're as independent as something being both blue and a square.
$C: People denigrating democracy
$C: Moreso than the FCC positions and the vote this thread is about, yes.
$C: All I'm saying is the only true power in our current state of things is the almighty dollar bill. You off a Republican and a Democrat the same amount and they'll both cave. That's just the way it is. Can it change? Definitely. Will it? Slowly, but I think we'll see it in our life time, for sure. People are becoming more aware and are speaking up more and more.
$C: It’s not often you find someone you agree with 100% of the time in the world, let alone in a politician. People should research candidates and make informed decisions. 
In most scenarios there wouldn’t be one sole reason I would or wouldn’t vote for someone. My bad for missing that implication in the OP. 
$C: Woah woah woah. I don't doubt it will work. It DIDNT work. 

I'm *clearly* asking for a better tactic. How the hell did you miss that? 

As for the hostile stuff, I'm sorry if I give a shit. I'm make sure to bring Disney movies and a glass of milk and some cookies next time. 

The time for nicey nicey letters to santa has passed. It's time to grow up and do something that has some weight to it. Although that time passed a while ago it's just people were ignorantly satisfied by texting a bot to send a letter for them. 
$C: The thing is, this is something we shouldn't even have to care about. Ultimately, ensuring the internet works correctly is a technical problem requiring a technical solution, and a few people here and there to implement that solution. Enough people find an interest in that sort of thing that the people who aren't don't need to worry or start a career in IT just so they can get their email.

But ISPs decided to pull stunts like [AT&T blocking Facetime](https://www.savetheinternet.com/att-facetime). <insert rest of Net Neutrality-related history here> And here we are.

And they're trying to get rid of copper lines. Fiber optics are great for high-speed internet access, but how am I supposed to make a phone call when the power is out? AT&T tricked me into getting their U-Verse Voice service by failing to disclose to me that my phone line would no longer be over powered copper wires. And the only reason I was calling them in the first place was because they screwed up my bill, where I had tried to order one service but they charged me for another. Instead of fixing that, they tried to offer me a "better deal", and I ended up taking it. It's not a better deal at all. I'm pissed.

People do care. I didn't try to convince other people they should care about this stuff until I saw that there was a problem that the geeks couldn't solve.
$C: Telling our reps is a solution. It failed but you're just whining because your not suggesting a solution. Stop trying to act so negative for no reason. People want to solve this problem, you're not helping.
$C: Also the fight isnt over because Ajit pai has to go to the courts to get this vote approved. It's failed before but it can fail again if we call our reps.
$C: r/killthosewhodisagree
$C: You're suggesting 10 million people stop using the internet like its no big deal. I think perhaps you're also being a bit ridiculous. 
$C: Sorry man, but you are flat wrong. No matter how many people live in the rest of the world without internet or what ass of whatever island you have visited or how many paleolithic half man apes didn't have internet; modern American life, the life WE ARE TALKING ABOUT requires internet.

People lose jobs because the internet is offline inadvertently all the time. I not only have internet but I have a cellular backup. Oh, and if you follow that "lost job" idea a few steps it is really not too hard to find people who die. They die because they lost their heat, they can't afford food.

Calling me entitled and claiming that because people survive without internet doesn't make boycotting a valid option. 
$C: > The problem is money in politics and money in media.

That is certainly a problem.

>You don't have the time, money, means, or intelligence to topple that beast legislatively.

Correct. No *single person* has the time, money, means, or intelligence. That's where unity comes in.

>This is just a game you can't win. The only way to fight unchecked capitalists is with capital. You use their capital to negatively affect their capital, in a way that forces change. Anything short of that, and you've lost.

But people have fought and beaten unchecked capitalists before without superior capital. They did it by out-organizing them (among other things). Look at the anti-tobacco movement in the 90s.

>The problem is that no one else is even attempting to discuss what can actually be done in a capitalist system to make it work for us rather than us for it.

I hear people talking about this all the time. Politicians have to talk about this in order to get elected.

>So, please, what do you propose we do? Give me a strategy, right now.

I don't have a strategy or a proposal. Sorry. As I said, we need more people willing to listen, not people willing to tell us how things should be done. But what do I know? Maybe you do have it all figured out. In that case, the best thing you could do is run for office.
$C: That legit sounds believable, that subreddit is filled with super far right assholes, obvious trolls, and people with broken English that post pro-Russian comments hmmmmm
$C: You are misconstruing what I am saying. I'm just trying to keep people safe while they protest. Large corporations and the "government" will attempt to label those that pursue a more violent path, to get what they want, as terrorists which will make it more difficult for us to protest.
$C: We aren't going to kill anyone. Pai is an annoying, piece of shit but violence gets us no where. It will just make things worse.

Fearing people is to peacefully flood the streets with protest. Going to the stairs of Congress and showing how strong we are as a people.

But very few want to do that so it is just doing this kind of back and forth arguing which gets us no where.
$C: Netflix was not "partnering with Comcast to build better internet". 

What actually happened is that Comcast deliberately throttled traffic to Netflix, resulting in video buffering to the point of unwatchability, not informing their customers about this fact, which resulted in Netflix customers cancelling their subscription en masse. They did so to blackmail them for millions of dollars, which they got. Purely through rent-seeking.

When I'm talking about people who oppose NN being liars, I mean people like this. I mean you.
$C: Well unless anyone has proof nobody could pursue anything but those "donations" from the isp companys probaly could be shown to have changed that chairmans vote. Hes a money hungry scoundrel

$C: Yeah, they could be like little stars they are forced to wear. Then we can easily get them all rounded up and put into camps.

$C: It just feels like such an easy way to lose an argument.

If you have enough legitimate ammo, don't muddy the waters with hyperbole.  
$C: You're a child molester if you molest someone under the age of consent.  Equating pedophiles and child molesters prevents pedophiles who do not act on their urges from seeking help.  There is already a huge social stigma against the disorder.
$C: They don't have to stay silent about an offer made. The only thing they can do is make an offer to negotiate, and to sign an NDA about the negotiations. That's probably what is most likely to go down, so that they aren't revealing their crooked offers.
$C: Maybe if people quit thinking because they are big we cant touch them they wouldnt wield so much power.

The assumption that we are powerless to these big corporations only making it easier for them to weild the power they have.

In the end they exist solely because of our hard earned money that we willingly give them. If people actually researched where all the money goes when they buy a product and decided accordingly upon purchase wether or not to support those industries, directly or indirectly, we wouldnt have these issues. Too bad people dont want to know where the money they spend on their concert tickets, coffee, fast food, or pretty much anything else goes. Ignorance is bliss yo, too bad it also destroys our society from the inside out.


$C: Lol, Fox News? You do realize they run on shitposting and fearmongering, right?
$C: Oh yes, *clearly* these subreddits represent all of them instead of being an echo chamber. That's like saying Tumblr represents all of the left.

$C: Not for long.
$C: You good people's.  I like you.
$C: They likely limit bandwidth to everything that isn't on the whitelist. So yeah, you can access a proxy, there's no way they'll manage to blacklist them all, but your connection to the proxy is slow. The fact that the proxy's connection to the internet is faster doesn't help - the connection bottlenecks between you and the proxy.

And yeah, if I'm dealing with throttled internet, I could use you as a proxy, but even if your connection is unfettered by ISP bullshit, that doesn't help if my connection to you isn't whitelisted by my ISP. And it probably won't be. Your small-time website won't be either. And the huge corporate websites that *are* paying for faster access are not likely to set up general proxies for people.

It wasn't feasible to do this before because they were operating off of blacklists - they were trying to detect proxies, p2p, etc., which is hard. But they don't have to do that once they start operating off of a whitelist. If *everything* that isn't whitelisted is slow, then proxies are slow too.

You might be able to get around it using some sort of distributed proxy scheme like it sounds like you're describing - making slow connections to many proxies and essentially turning your browser into a torrent client for websites - but that's a pretty big change, the infrastructure isn't really designed for it, and it wouldn't help at all whenever packets are deprioritized rather than bandwidth limited.
$C: > Them trying to stop proxies will be as effective as them stopping p2p networking.

Which is incredibly easy to do when you're slowing and blocking EVERYTHING except your whitelist of sites in the packages you've paid for, none of which will contain proxies or VPN servers, or ssh access.
$C: This, coupled with an r/darknetplan would be a great idea. And why not throw in a free VPN for good measure?
$C: [deleted]
$C: [deleted]
$C: doesnt a vpn just mask your ip? How could you use one if you don't have internet because you don't pay? I'm pretty ignorant to all this network stuff. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: ISPs don’t need to individually block them if everything is throttled besides their whitelist.
$C: Yes, the FCC just killed the rules that prevented them from throttling or blocking literally anything for literally any reason they want.  The ability to use a VPN is an extra $1,800 a month as of this hour.
$C: Also because it's their tunnel, they can still read all the traffic passing through it. 
$C: ISPs will use a whitelist. Everything will be throttled except the sites that pay. 
$C: Net Neutrality was given a formal name in 2015, but it's existed since at least 2004.

> In February 2004 then Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael Powell announced a set of non-discrimination principles, which he called the principles of "Network Freedom". In a speech at the Silicon Flatirons Symposium, Powell encouraged ISPs to offer users these four freedoms:
> 
> Freedom to access content
> Freedom to run applications
> Freedom to attach devices
> Freedom to obtain service plan information
> 
> In early 2005, in the Madison River case, the FCC for the first time showed willingness to enforce its network neutrality principles by opening an investigation about Madison River Communications, a local telephone carrier that was blocking voice over IP service. [...] The investigation was closed before any formal factual or legal finding and there was a settlement in which the company agreed to stop discriminating against voice over IP traffic and to make a $15,000 payment to the US Treasury in exchange for the FCC dropping its inquiry.

There may have been ambiguous laws regarding ISPs, but the FCC established a set of principles and enforced them.

Edit: And before that, the internet was accessed over dial-up modems, which used phone lines, which were protected by the Telecommunications Act.

Edit2: After dial-up modems, and before broadband (what we use now), the internet was accessed over DSL, *which was also protected by the Telecommunications Act*.
$C: I see you're shitposting
$C: You dong think having a single ISP at more than a third of American homes isn't anticompetitive?
$C: Go read Bell Atlantic v. Twombly and tell me that antitrust litigation and regulations against these ISP's will work. I'll give you a hint, the same shit happened with the same companies maintaining illegal monopolies in the phone business and they got away with it to this day
$C: Those laws are nigh unenforceable, and actions take years.
$C: [deleted]
$C: MADISON RIVER:  In 2005, North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.

COMCAST: In 2005, the nation’s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly blocking peer-to-peer technologies that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. 2007 investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.

TELUS: In 2005, Canada’s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, began blocking access to a server that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.

AT&T: From 2007–2009, AT&T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such “over-the-top” voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&T when it came on the scene in 2009.

WINDSTREAM: In 2010, Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream’s own search portal and results.

MetroPCS: In 2011, MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon’s court challenge against the FCC’s 2010 open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency’s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.

PAXFIRE: In 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person’s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service’s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites. 

AT&T, SPRINT and VERIZON: From 2011–2013, AT&T, Sprint and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called Isis, which all three companies had a stake in developing.

EUROPE: A 2012 report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace. 

VERIZON: In 2012, the FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon’s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the 2008 airwaves auction.

AT&T: In 2012, AT&T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers’ iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&T’s own products. 

VERIZON: During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC in 2013, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency’s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: “I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.” Walker’s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.
$C: You must be new to Comcast.
$C: There's plenty that has been done, apparently.

https://wccftech.com/net-neutrality-abuses-timeline/

This is just the first thing I found after looking up "before net neutrality" on Google. I'm sure there's a lot more to find. I recall reading about Comcast actually blocking Gmail at one point so that it would fail to send mail, and then they'd pretend it's a bug on Gmail's end and suggest using Comcast mail instead.
$C: Why would they try to get a major online player to pay extra money for a service it already has? Why would an internet provider degrade service to erode user base?

There are no examples of this kind of shady business practice hasnt been done?

Really?

Start by googling the fight between netflix and comcast. 

$C: > We’ve had no net neutrality plenty of times in modern history and this hasn’t been done.

You mean, like, before the Internet? Cuz yeah, it was totally fine then.
$C: > no net neutrality plenty of times in modern history

You mean duing the time when there was no Internet? 
$C: We can fight, but no one is united. It will get worse until we unite. When we unite thats where we take control.


But until then, we will continue to get crushed.
$C: I wish people would understand their stupid little power fantasy over their guns was so absurd as you have described it here, so they'd focus on making sure the government stays benevolent enough that they don't have to worry about it.
$C: The North Vietnamese army beat the U.S why wouldn't an armed populace be able to do the same.

$C: Exactly. And making this point isn't a whataboutism, it's a firm reminder that Party loyalty Ruins nations. Period. 
$C: Bullshit. One is WAY more complicit than the other. Saying "both parties are the same" became really unfair years ago.

In the case of Net Neutrality, the vote split between Reps and Dems is clear - all Dems are FOR NN, while nearly all Reps are AGAINST NN.

Youre getting excited that youre getting negative attention...that alone tells me you have issues but the fact that this affects you too and you still talk like somehow youre above it all?

Priceless!
$C: What are you talking about? This decision should be celebrated. Net neutrality belongs in the hands of the FTC, not in the hands of the FCC. Do any of you even know what you're crying about? You're all corporate tools.

Oh and conservatives should have a safe space on Reddit. You guys have the rest of the site. 
$C: None.  Unlike a lot of the liberal shills spamming subs and creating subs.
$C: You say that like my criticism does not extend to them, too. Difference is, /r/latestagecapitalism didn't enable the current situation that is now going to inhibit Reddit's bottom line and oh so much more after the fact.

Speaking of 'targeting one thing because it suits your agenda' and all. I love it when you guys attack the middle like it's the far left.
$C: latestagecapitalism isn't against NN and doesn't support the oligarchic government of Trump. T_D is bad for this site and damaging to any hope for a return to democracy.

**And** when those places become relevant *to the current situation*, then that will [not] sound ~~more~~ like a 'whataboutism'.

Focusing back on topic: We start with excising the biggest cancer, otherwise it's going to continue to do more damage. Then, like a terminal illness, I doubt the people it will affect most will care until it's too late.

edit: i fucking kno words
$C: What kind of music you into bro?
$C: If the mods of the sub aren't allowing reasonable few speech,I don't get why Reddit needs to give the sub free speech either
$C: I got called a pinko commie traitor and banned from T_D simply for disagreeing with the group. I wasn't actively shitposting, I wasn't attacking people, I wasn't trying to troll or stir up anti-anything-sentiment. I just disagreed.

Next thing I know, I'm called the above things, labelled a "russian" and kicked from the sub.

For the record I'm in Australia and literally didn't have a dog in the race for whether Trump was elected or not. I participated in the subreddit occasionally because often there were people there making very good points about certain things.

So don't try to defend the rabid tarring-and-feathering and subsequent banning of people from T_D as enforcing the rules, because it's not, it's about eliminating dissent. Communities need civil dissent to thrive - it allows growth. Unsurprisingly T_D is currently circling the drain and huffing its own farts.

$C: I keep having to explain what it is when I urge people to do something about it. I'm so used to being in my bubble of Reddit, techie coworkers, and news, that I forgot how many people just plain don't know what it is. 

I relish this opportunity to explain it, but a lot of times the ISP marketing get to these people first with their billions of dollars pushing false information. That's tougher, because then you have to deprogram them first, bringing up sources and explanations that contradict whatever lie they were told last, tailoring your argument to whatever preconception they have in their head. It's very frustrating.
$C: If it's a bad idea or Trump agrees, they're for it. Although those two have been the same thing a lot lately.

I don't think anyone understands what you are talking about. And they probably suspect you don't either. And that sentence kind of reads like a contradiction, or at least a confusing and nonsensical statement. Just my 2 cents.
$C: The only people who will benefit from this are the ISP execs. This is not a good thing overall. I am arguing that a "good" outcome would be if Congress would have done what you said *beforehand*. But we both know they're paid to do the opposite.

If you support the decision of Pai, the joke was you are either a paid shill, or an unpaid water carrier.

Or the person is just too stupid, and does not see regulatory capture as a problem. 
$C: No, you get rid of local regulations that make it needlessly difficult to compete with ISPs. You know... the **actual problem.** Reddit doesn't seem to give a shit about that though... weird.
$C: deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.9371  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/83024)
$C: If you're defending OP's comment, then you are wrong. If your complaint is about centralized government power, but then you support NN, you're an idiot.
$C: It was a joke. He was saying Republicans are brain dead and cannot think.
$C: you mention that small businesses can't compete against the likes of Netflix and Google, which is true.  They're well established and have a huge following.  But the tech industry has much lower costs associated with starting than most industries.  Anyone can just make a website or an app that blows up.  Monopolies don't exist in a Neutral Internet because you can visit whatever websites you want without anyone influencing that.  Google can influence what comes up on their searches, but there are other search engines and internet browsers to choose from if you don't like the results they give you.  

ISPs are also huge businesses that no small business can compete with.  They even have local monopolies in many places which means that consumers don't have another option.  They are already overcharging consumers for services.  Without net neutrality, they will be able to demand that businesses pay for "fast-lane" internet.  That won't hurt the large businesses like Netflix and Google--they can afford to pay it.  The people who it will hurt the most are the small businesses and individuals who want fast internet.  It will add an additional cost to every internet business that is trying to start up.

In theory the extra revenue *could* be used to support infrastructure and give consumers cheaper products, but they have had subsidies in the past from the government that they squandered.  Consumers have no reason to trust them on this because they have a long history of filling their own wallets, and disappointing their customers.
$C: Baao got it right. I was poking fun at republicans implying that they don't think.
$C: Modern republicans are either brain-dead or maliciously greedy or, more often than not,  both. If this isn't what they stand for,  then why were they ones to propose it? Why were they the only ones in favor of it? Why didn't they listen to their constituents telling them not to repeal it? Oh right, because republicans don't stand for the people, only themselves. 
$C: They think you take jokes too seriously. He was right. Shut up.
$C: I had a guy calling me a mindless sheep cuz I wasn’t voting for trump. Pretty annoying. Dude just kept saying, “just think about it, you’re not thinking at all.”
$C: You took an absolutist stance in your politics. I was hoping you were smart enough to extract that from the statement.
$C: Dont tell me or others what I do and don't know. You dont know me. 
$C: I’m great, just sick of all the knowitalls proclaiming all matter-of-fact like that this is the end, that providers will become the mafia, and so on.  This law was never about customers, or cost controls, or anything of the like.  It was always about control, and everyone should understand that with government control ALWAYS comes increased cost(s), corruption, inefficiency, and political games.  The repeal is a win for anyone that understands that competition is crucial to a successful economy.
$C: Wow, the people on that sub seem really ignorant and way too eager to throw things into the hands of corporations. I’m not exactly the most trusting of government, but I think big business is worse, because they pursue profit over everything, which puts consumers and employees in precarious positions. 
$C: You're not though, which is the point. The people screeching about net neutrality could be screeching about **the actual problem**, but they're not. Why? Because you guys have an irrational, outdated fear of markets, and a natural proclivity towards government control.
$C: Is this a joke? Here's your definition of "freedom":

So much regulatory capture in local governments that it's impossible for new ISPs to even exist. Then, to "solve" that problem, you just add on more government regulation to control what those unnatural monopoly ISPs can do. In what sense is that "freedom"? It's the dumbest shit I've ever fucking heard.

My definition of freedom: STOP LETTING THE GOVERNMENT CONTROL PEOPLE.

Where's the flaw in my logic exactly? There's nothing wrong with corporations naturally consolidating because they can use economies of scale to be more efficient. It happens all the time and it's fine. PLEASE, show me where my logic is flawed. I'd love to hear it.
$C: What ISPs or utility companies exist in a free market?
$C: YEAH. FUCK THE POLICE.


*Cough* Uh, yah?
$C: I see that you are getting downvoted, but I think you make a perfectly fair point. I currently live in Texas and we have a bad rap of being racist rednecks. However, I find the people in this state to be far more welcoming to immigrants than many other places I have lived. I have always respected the fact that most leaders in Texas, even Rick Perry and Ted Cruz, that have been in support of legal immigration.  For the record I have little respect for these 2 other than that. As the state approaches 50% Hispanic, we have a thriving economy and culture built on immigration, and most our political leaders recognize this.

I also live next to a border wall that was built during the Bush junior administration that has done nothing to prevent illegal immigration and only contributed to our country's recession at the time. I have contempt for the GOP leaders that act like they have a monopoly on Christianity while spewing hate for "the other". The GOP is again promoting building walls and banning muslims in the name of security, and these leaders by far get the support of the religious right. 

And I am now way off topic. 
$C: > next time tho ecxain how that’s a fallacy

Huh? 

Libertarianism is Brain Cancer.
$C: > Um, I did. I'm a Berniecrat that voted Trump.

There you go u/DizzleSlaunsen23! Point proven! You disagree that his statement isn't good enough take it up with him!

> I knew Trump would be bad for the country, but at least he's a cartoon what wears his evil on his sleeve.

OOOOOOOOHHH! So...  BECAUSE he is the biggest, open, obvious idiot to NOT vote for, you'll just go ahead and vote for him anyway. obiwangoodjob.gif

Oh ok.
$C: The only us vs. them I see is the woke members of the underclass vs. the greedy billionaires and the citizens who subscribe to their plutocratic propaganda and agenda against their own interests, the former of which needs to be met with regulation and the latter of which needs to be won over.

My comment above reflects the issue of Hillary being repeatedly brought up as a whatabout by those who are seeking only to say, with resignation, that everyone is equally corrupt. That's false.

Sure, if you want to follow the chain of events and trace it back to the fact that maybe, if Bernie had won in a fair primary, none of this would have happened. But that's useless. A rigged primary is far from our biggest problem right now, and shouldn't consistently be fallen back on as a lens to say "Oh well shits broke"
$C: > Yes, none of you want the very companies who build and expand the infrastructure to have power over their own infrastructure.

We paid for the infrastructure expansion you fucking moron.  YOU take a step back or go back to /r/conservative.

>Which would encourage better and faster speeds, and more options.... how exactly

In the same way that we might invent great things oh, i dunno, like the fucking internet because we broke apart the enormously powerful ma bell monopoly in 1983.  Weird that the invention of the internet and the break up of the monopoly coincide so well.
$C: Is this like that time Verizon promised new infrastructure and took over 2billion dollars and then.... Did nothing? 
$C: Think about this: Fedex and UPS don't deliver to everywhere, for example, extremely rural locations.

Same exact principle for a wholly private internet. It wasn't profitable for any local ISP to run wire to my grandparents country farmhouse, so they ended up getting some crazy extortionate satellite internet hookup.

Sure, maybe a fully corporatized, private marketplace can create some healthy competition in urban metropolis' or otherwise well-populated areas.

But it's simply not in their best interest to do so for the entire country, despite the fact that internet is quickly becoming an essential utility. We need to consider serious changes because of the evolving nature of our society. Email now is getting to be as essential as mail was in the late 1800s.
$C: Tell me, when corporations are big enough to set their own prices and have regional monopolies scattered across the country, and THEN they want to become the profiteering middle man for all senders and receivers of electronic information, how does THAT benefit consumers? 

Honestly, the pro-net neutrality side is the one with the evidence.
$C: Obviously the people that want to put in their own infrastructure want to maintain control of it. The problem is they want exclusivity to put in the infrastructure in the first place. Essentially, if we build the lines and poles for the City or for this neighborhood then no one else can use them. "Sorry you want to use Verizon's services you live in a Comcast neighborhood" is unacceptable for basic telecom lines. It all goes back to the idea that the internet should be regulated as a utility. 


In regards to your other question: It increases competition, provides consumers with choice, both of which demonstrably result in better services, products and costs. 


I've been a lifelong republican, evangelical voter, but the actions of the GOP under Obama and the administration have jaded me. There has not been a single action taken under this united Republican government that has actually benefited the country. The middle class is making less than it did before, prices are higher for all types of goods than ever, the poor are continuously maligned and mistreated, they alienate potential voting groups with unnessecsey xenophobic and sexist comments, and they have refused to engage in any type of rational debate or process in pursuing ANY of the measures they've put forward. This is just one of many steps that follows on that path. 

I'll be exercising my vote in the primaries and the general to get these people out of Washington. It's time for them to represent me, my peers, and my community and not these self-serving business who will nickel and dime us whereever they can. 


$C: It would shake up the market and allow actual competition and drive down prices and force innovation.
$C: redditor for 2 months

spews trump and anti nn rhetoric nearly constantly

ayy lmao
$C: You really think they're not. I'm sorry for your stupidity
$C: Ah thoroughly brainwashed already then. Move on
$C: In response to your first point, fair there are probably people who don't have any real grasp on the issue and are just parroting angry statements. But, I personally think that it's not feasible from the perspective of a movement to have everyone have a film grasp. Similar to war(though I hate that analogy) there are the generals and commanders the know he full scope, and there are the grunts. I think it's necessary to gain traction so as to avoid having to educate every single person.

I'm not going to pretend to have knowledge on your second point, I have no idea how this will pan out internationally.

When it comes to consumers, I don't think it will end up apocalyptic, but I do see some predatory pricing practices coming.
$C: Let them know that they are the worst shame of a democratic country. When people literally die for that right and they still can't see why they should give a damn.
$C: so you're old enough to run for Congress
$C: I like how you say they're not the same, but then try to give them moral equivalence. So in your mind, actively trying to tear down our government so they can point and say "see, I told you it didn't work" is the same as trying to pass gun control. You also buy into the idea that any gun control is anti second amendment. What is an arm, are bombs arms, if I was able to procure a nuclear bomb does the second amendment allow me to keep it? Look at the historical context and stop pretending that the founding fathers were enshrining your right to a weapon that can kill hundreds in seconds.
$C: Well lets just put this way The dems are a lady down the blokc who acts shady and a little kid disappeared when he went near her house never to be seen again, but then we got the gop who everytime a family moves into a house on their block they disapear and the scent of rot and decaying flesh has defiled surounding neighborhood emanating from his house's basement
$C: Dilly dilly
$C: To the pit of misery. 
$C: That's what is required imo. People are letting far too much slide in this administation. Ya'll need to be out there with pitchforks throwing rocks at this point for christ sake.
$C: I like your suggestion. Whether they're left or right doesn't matter. What matters is their heart for our well being 
$C: So, Bernie then.

None of the above matters if the party doesn't even nominate them. Is Bernie running for 2020?
$C: We have a volunteer!
$C: Lol your fucking "slow progress" is getting steamrolled by corporate interests. Power is consolidating into so few hands that the boundaries between the wealthy and the state are the most blurred they have ever been. Your power no longer lies in the legitimacy of your institutions, but the power we have in numbers. 
$C: And raise other family's taxes by far more. Even if it helps you, it hurts many more.
$C: Well I hope you enjoy that pittance for however long it lasts (latest news is that GOP is now looking into having those cuts expire even sooner) and pray you don't get fucked by the exploding health care costs, massive cuts in public spending, and the inevitable recession. Oh and you better not be a resident of a blue state, who are going to be hit hardest by the tax scam. 
$C: I'm guessing you don't live in a blue state, then?
$C: In this case, there was protest before the vote - mostly by complaining to congresspeople, who then called on the fcc to cancel the vote.

And now that the vote is done, we have 60 days to get Congress to vote with a simple majority to cancel it. Actual in-the-street protest can help with that (but, you know, republicans...)
$C: While they don't stand on the same ground for every issue, they're both corrupt. If what the DNC did this last election didn't show you that, I don't know what will.
$C: You already did it, and thank you, but if anyone else wants to send but doesn't know what to say: tell them how you feel by the FCC'S vote. If you feel betrayed, tell them that. Tell them how important you feel net neutrality is, tell them that if they don't support it, they'll lose your vote in the next election (and mean it). 
$C: He can ask for it if he pays for it but it's unlikely it'll change anything. 
$C: I get what your saying now. The wording is a bit weird I can understand why people are confused. 
$C: But this is no longer about net neutrality. This is about our government directly and willfully ignoring the people who give it it's power. To stop the tide, it will take a lot. We might as well start now, before we lose anything more important.
$C: And the future would be a startup from mars vi spaceX....  oh wait without net neutrality there is no future internet......
$C: The future, now that this has been repealed, is *actually paying* for internet porn
$C: Did you ever try actually getting a Prodigy account?  It was almost as difficult as getting an eWorld account.

And as we all know, EarthLink got swallowed up by AT&T already....

$C: Is it terrorism if it's on behalf of a belief that 80% of the people hold, that an unelected body is attempting to destroy? 
$C: Oh...so the billions of dollars we spend on our military are for moral support with marshmallow slingshots?
$C: /r/wordsalad
$C: You should try learning to type out your words correctly. That way your bullshit won’t be such bullshit.
$C: Obvious troll is obvious
$C: While the idea sounds nice. It really doesn't fix the problem. Plus, for every dollar we give, these lobbyist will throw in $10,000. 

In the end, it will just be more money in your politicians pocket and them still siding with the highest bidder. 

We all know the reason answer is to get lobbying out of the politics. Of course, those in charge have to pass those laws and they would never do so. But, that is the real answer and fix to every problem America has. 
$C: Of course it will be used as such.

They're already lying and making stuff up. Faking votes from dead people. All in attempts to make it look more positive for their position. 

At this point, I would not be surprised if this bomb thread was fake and simply done as a means to use as more fuel against net neutrality supporters.
$C: Violence formed this country

$C: Well you can stream direct TV for free with att. I get Spotify and like 40 other music apps I've never heard of data free with metro PCS. TMobile has the same thing. Face it, reddits red background image and supportive "we stand together" is all fucking bullshit. Nobody is or ever was going to create fast lanes or slow down sites for an "extra payment". Why would they? I'd just get my wife an att phone with data free tv and I'd keep MetroPCS for the data free music. Has everyone forgotten the internet prior 2015? And then the internet post 2015.
$C: You just told me that Net Neutrality kept companies from throttling or giving fast lanes to certain sites and services.

What happened when Comcast did that? Outrage? Are they still doing it?

How about the other example you used. Outrage? Are they still doing it?

There was no need for the internet to be power grabbed away from the private companies who provide the service and placed in the US governments greedy little pockets. Why the fuck should an ISP ever have to worry about getting a yearly fucking BROADCAST LICENSE? Search "fcc title ii".
$C: > but they did screw it up and if they wanted, Madison could challenge it since FCC had no authority on it

They likely would have lost that challenge and it would have changed the entire framework of how we are having a discussion today.  I have very little doubt that the federal court in that jurisdiction would have found in favor of the FCC which would have set precedent for other courts to find in favor of the FCC in future cases.
$C: Saying the vote happened when it didn't yet happen is the very dictionary example of saying a lie. I get it, getting the thread out early and all, but you can't with a straight face say that an empirical lie isn't a lie. 
$C: Can you explain the point my comment proved?
$C: No, don't wish that on them. That's not right.

EDIT: Really? I'm being downvoted for not wanting people to be fucking bombed?
$C: > They'll simply have law enforcement remove the people from the area once it becomes too inconvenient.

That doesn't work if there's 100,000+ people.

Korea ousted their president using peaceful protest. Iceland rewrote their constitution and dissolved their government using peaceful protest. 

I think if there was a sustained mass protest, blocking key areas of commerce (and thus costing those in charge money), it would work. It has been proven as such.

The only problem is that Americans seem like they don't have the time or persistence to really make these protests matter and last, which is the only way they'd be effective. So instead they are considering violence, which only puts the ball in the court of those who have a monopoly on violence: The state. 

They WANT people to get violent if they're going to protest, then they're easy to marginalize and gun down without reproach. If there are peaceful masses who won't move until a problem is solved, there's no way for them to deal with that without looking like the bad guy, which only rallies more people to the cause. 
$C: Which is exactly why they won’t let us elect them. If you still think the voters actually have any say, let me remind you of the democratic primary. 
$C: 'I don't vote because I heard once it doesn't matter, therefore every vote is a throwaway. We should just kill our leaders once we get tired of them."
$C: I understand that. But there were also a lot who were against it, despite overwhelming majorities of their constituents vehemently supporting net neutrality. You can’t ignore that.
$C: It's not just about net neutrality. I'm not condoning violence but have we forgotten that it is a fundamental right of the American people to forcibly overthrow our government if it no longer represents our interests?
$C: I in no way agree with all of Obama’s policies, but Net Neutrality was good, it actually helped the average human. It’s repeal was corruption in every sense but the legal one, because our government has legalized corruption in the corporate sense and called it lobbying. Ajit Pai was *lobbied* to kill Net neutrality, yes he was payed thousands of dollars, promised cushy jobs after his term and had clear conflicts of interest with the Telecom business, but that was all legal... because it was a corporation doing it. Until we kill the corporation’s participation in our government, and ideally the corporations themselves, we will never have a fair or just government that acts on the behalf of the people.
$C: sounds like someone wouldnt kill hitler cause he couldnt see what he was gonna do before coming in power. good one bro, you just let something like 6m jews die 
$C: You guys need to calm down. We really don't need a civil war part 2.
$C: Back then the military was just as well armed as your average dude, at least in comparison to today. 

I could do without MRAP's and Strikers outside my apartment. 
$C: no that unfortunately doesn't work. You don't want to make a martyr of him. You need a mass movement.
$C: > First, unless innocent bystanders, people dying in war isn't murder. 

I'm not sure you understand what a **CIVIL** war is.  The kind you're advocating.  Do you know how they recruited people to fight in the American civil war (Confederate)?

They rounded up all the men they found, gave them a gun, told them to fight.  Anyone that refused got a bullet to their head.

War is a giant clusterfuck and you're advocating for it.

Not having your politics win (I'll leave the reasons for that aside for now), **IS NOT CAUSE FOR WAR**.

> I said it was intended as a joke.

So you were joking about actually wanting any sort of american revolution?

You are not the first leftist on reddit to say that seriously and defend it.
$C: [deleted]
$C: I should’ve checked his post history before even bothering. Just another troll that gets off on making people angry as if being an asshole is a virtue. 
$C: You're a nasty shit who can't have an argument without hurling insults. So how's this? Fuck you, fuck the bloated federal government, I WIN. HOW YA LIKE THEM APPLES YOU LITTLE BITCH
$C: And your the person that would rather have the federal government wipe your ass rather than guy buy some toilet paper
$C: That's not worse case scenario, but not surprising you think that given you're agreeing with a guy who doesn't understand even the basics of the net neutrality argument, which frankly puts you in the same category.
$C: Because when you go saying shit like "hurdur internet is a necessity" you quickly make it apparent logic does not apply to you. 1. No it fucking isn't and 2. Did I fucking miss something? Is the government unplugging the internet? Do you need to sacrifice your 1st born to access it? Or are the rules just going back to what they were 2 years ago, you fucking inbred retard
$C: What? You misunderstood maybe. I meant the elders’s bills will go down. 

People that use the internet for all sorts of things would be punished the most. People that do next to nothing online but check emails would be fine. 
$C: Uh huh. Whatever you say pal
 Either way saying the law has always been in place is fucking retarded. And your implications are a complete work of fantasy.
$C: 14 year old redditors don't understand that net neutrality didn't even exist a few years ago.

They think this is the end of the world.
$C: It's reddit. They'll bitch and moan and use the curse words mommy and daddy use when they're not around, and then after a month or two of \#rise and unanswered calls for action they'll retreat back to Netflix and r/adviceanimals and later talk about how epic and momentous their rebellion was

So don't worry; their bloodlust is at least an empty threat
$C: Damn man, you got me. You're so above me that you just automatically win every argument without ever having to even make one. I'm impressed.
$C: He just said violence. Cutting ground wires is vandalism and not violence. I'm pretty sure they meant more overall

A riot isn't usually a "massive revolution" either. A riot doesn't need to lead to a massive revolution to still be effective. 
$C: Understood. But were reaching a tipping point. A lot of people are forgetting that more people are not in favor of this. The majority of people do not agree with how the country is being run. We have the numbers but do we have the right. People in the past didn't riot over Obama presidency because a majority of people supported legislation passed. Now a majority do not agree. 
$C: Bring it on. Go back to the_d while some black man you hate cuckholds your wife while you jerk it to pizzagate conspiracy articles and asphyxiate yourself to the tune of some Toby Keith music. 
$C: It's funny people seem to be thinking they meant like form a goddamn militia or something lol.

I took it as rioting. Which, lots of groups have successfully rioted in the US. Also, most people on a riot go home afterwards with 0 consequences and only a minority are arrested and fined/convicted or injured. People are hardly "put down like dogs".

I do think you're wrong to assume only  limp wristed nerds and basement dwellers care about this stuff. This affects all Americans. This affects many businesses negatively. I think you need to step back and consider just how important the internet is to society and consider that more people than those you described are very emotional over this.

People have rioted over less. People will continue to riot over less. And you are insane if you think people protesting and turning violent will successfully be labeled as domestic terrorists by the actual general public.

And naturally we are American. We are fairly violent so I don't understand why you would want to downplay any movement with potential to turn violent in the future.

Your whole post just makes you seem really unaware of the country around you 
$C: >dogs

Please don't insult dogs.
$C: Please go back to the donald , unless you're cool with me cuckholding your lover while you jerk it to pepe memes using liberal tears as lube ? Oh you probably don't know What cuckhold means. Ha go back to the hole you came from troll. 
$C: >  Go right now. I'll be on the other side. 

No you won't you fucking pussy, you'll be hiding in the corner of your basement and will beg for mercy the second someone finds you. And if you were on the other side, shame on you for supporting the FCC.
$C: lol
$C: Uh oh we got a big boy over here 
$C: What kind of brute are you?
$C: But Iraq and Vietnam didn't happen because of the American Revolution, while twenty years of France being in war with everybody was a direct result of the French Revolution. 
$C: I seriously doubt that. When Obama was in office, there's no way 90% of them supported the status quo. 
$C: Sorry girl
$C: I see. In that case if the left were to revolt against an oppressive government, an urban insurgency that spreads to other cities and the countyside is probably their best bet.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Ah, well fuck you too then, bud.
$C: Ah, another unreachable.

Fuck you too.
$C: When did I ever say it was realistic to expect it to happen in the US? An authoritarian US government would basically be invincible. No way anything would be able to bring it down barring a foreign invasion. Even then most foreign nations would prefer an authoritarian US over supporting opposition parties.

All I'm saying is that those things are essential to run a revolution or insurgency. The Viet Cong had those things and backing from North Vietnam and the USSR. Iraq's insurgency had backing from foreigners living in Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia and others. They also had many of the weapons needed to conduct an insurgency.
$C: You could repeat that same sentiment, again, during the Obama Administration to the right group of people, and they would storm the Whitehouse and burn any semblance of order that we currently have. 

Are you willing to sacrifice your family for the internet?

That, is the stakes we are talking about with any revolt. 

Give me liberty or give me death, always has a 50% chance of death.

Ajit was part of that deal, and we were making that known back when he was running.

That's my threshold. Can you guarantee I will ever like my government?
$C: The Declaration was a letter to the British - that is not a law of our land.  Try again.

The 2nd Amendment was to ensure a balance between state and federal armed forces, as a nod to the fact many people were still wary of a centralized, standing army after we had fought hard against one (i.e., the British and their allies).  It had no clause to kill the government if you were unhappy - quite the opposite, it was meant to offer a balance of military roles in support of our security at national and state levels.

$C: Is the market really free when Internet service is essentially a localised monopoly (sometimes legally, in cases where local laws prohibit new ISPs from setting up)? It's interesting to me that the republican-backed FCC has no real interest in striking down laws at the local level preventing competition, and I'm sure it has nothing to do with the funding republican lawmakers have received from large ISPs.
$C: Capitalism works wonders but only when it is regulated, cause if we don't have regulations we are at the mercy of companies. Again history has proven capitalism works, but the laissez-faire Capitalism you're referencing didn't work. You know why it didn't work? Because if companies have no real competition (like the ISPs who were lobbying to repeal net neutrality do) then they can charge whatever they want and we have nowhere else to turn to.

And also not wanting to pay for something doesn't mean you should restrict an industry's ability to charge you for it? Are you kidding me? If a company wanted to charge me $300 for a glass of water and they were the only company I could buy water from do you think that I should just stop complaining? No of course not, I'm going to tell the government that they should make rules that say that big companies that have no competition can't charge me out the ass for stuff if I have nowhere else to turn to for.
$C: Well we are moving more and more in that direction. Listen healthcare and food production are the only true thing I think we need but imagine if the internet went bye bye tomorrow...woudnlt' be pretty
$C: Good question. I'd have to think about that one. I don't think I've even been in a position where voting one way or another would "greatly" benefit me.
$C: Don't you ruin our fucking festival for fucks sake
$C: You're being lied to by Fox news and the great big Cheeto. Very few mass shootings are related to political affiliation. The only standout link between any of the following mass shootings is the republican policies of allowing everyone and anyone to have a gun, and a restriction on access to mental health care.

**The top 10 deadliest mass shootings.**

Las Vegas - no known motive

Pulse Nightclub - Religious Motivation, anti-gay, republican viewpoints.

Virginia Tech - Mental Illness, schizophrenia

Sandy Hook - Mental Illness

Sutherlands Church - Mental Illness

Killeen Texas - Hated woman and minorities, that's pretty Republican.



It's pretty clear you are gullible and partisan, I hope Roy Moore's loss this week prepares you for the inevitable prison sentence.


$C: Well... I think the whole idea of taking money from these businesses and voting in their favor is extremely corrupt, but its not really similar to advocating for politically motivated violence. 
$C: That time has already came. If you have the opportunity to benefit yourself, emotionally or monetarily, 9/10 times people will do it even if it hurts others. Claiming that getting rid of net neutrality won’t make ISPs take advantage of their customers for money is ridiculous. It already happens with data on phones. They advertise unlimited data, but if you go above 30gb, they throttle you to nothing.

$C: That's exactly the problem with our politics. You aren't willing to give an inch or compromise.. which many on the other side arent. This has lead to complete polarization in politics. You're absolutely correct about there being a wrong side in politics and neither party falls on the correct side on all issues. The polarization brings us to each party trying to dismantle and discredit everything the other party previously did. It's unbelievably counterproductive.  Until the parties can work together and come to meaningful middle ground... We'll continue to be screwed by politics.
$C: > If our elected democrats start fucking around too, I'll vote against them as well.

$C: How do they go out of business? I only have one choice where I live. Installing new infrastructure for a new company to compete is not only a legal nightmare but requires significant financial investment with no way to make that money back (not a big enough market to get return of investment). It's incredibly unlikely in smaller, rural areas (even towns of 50-100k) to see competition and we would be subject to (in my case) Charter's whim with no recourse. How would you suggest I deal with that situation? If the answer is move, then that's exactly what I am suggesting.

$C: two ways I could see mesh networks helping.

if there are isps (ex Google, cloud providers like aws, etc) not throttling the internet, mesh networks could route traffic around the 'damaged' parts of the network.

if enough people get on the mesh, it could lead to providers offering services solely on the mesh, not the internet as we know it. similar to .onion sites on tor
$C: Could we not set up an oversized "lan" that uses U/HF radio waves to transmit or satellites? Granted we'd have no external access from this, but we could lay a foundation?

I saw a post a few weeks back about some guy that provided internet to his neighborhood through his own connection, the other houses simply didn't have the fiber drop there from the local ISP. So if we do this but with some net neutral provider at the nearest outlet to each region we could simulate a free internet again right?
$C: Where is the ISP involved in a p2p mesh network? Like say with all Bluetooth connections? Or even all ad hoc wifi?

> 
> 2nd: It stifles small business and free market

This is flat out wrong. Small businesses will have a harder time breaking into the market without Net Neutrality as they will need to pay to play with businesses many sizes bigger than themselves who have a vested interest in keeping them down or destroying them.

As for Small ISP's trying to compete, good luck. Google couldn't even compete with the amount of lawsuits and paperwork that current ISP's made them jump through. The cost to entry for ISP's is too high for any small business to even consider trying to jump in, this simply won't happen.

If there are other reasons besides that please tell me, there is a reason that net neutrality is almost universally supported by businesses and universally opposed by ISP's.

Hahahaha. I'm sorry he has no answer to the points I put up. You can't prevent the suffering your kid will face. If you think it is unnecessary to reproduce because of some personal choice, please be my guest. You will be breaking an unbroken line of mothers since the beginning of time.

>unnecessary suffering

But to repeat what I said to him, to you. The arrogance of this statement is off the charts. Even the working class american is way more wealthy than any standard of living in the past. There has never been a time in history without suffering. Your statement is such a slap in the face to everybody who has come before you, including your parents.

You also seem to think being alive is unnecessary suffering, the cost of living is too high to bring a new person into the world, so why don't you kill yourself if life is so horrible? Whatever answer you have to that question, applies to your future kid too.

What I'm trying to say here is that they **need** us.  Without us, they are **nothing**.
$C: Well, most are a mixture between socialism and capitalism, with a variety of proportions. Many countries have (partially to fully) state owned railway, telecom, television, postal service, health insurance etc. companies, as private entities are not trusted with certain obligations and risks. There is no truly socialist country in europe, also because obviously disallowed by the big capitalist player, but that doesn't mean certain levels are not implemented. Also, with the probably upcoming loss of jobs through more digital technology, there are serious discussions about going further towards socialism as you can't tolerate large portions of the population starving. An example is an unconditional income for everyone, which is currently being tested in finland, if i recall correctly.
$C: I mean you make a detailed criticism I'll make a detailed rebuttal. Since we're operating on the level of lukewarm takes and internet snark, I figured I'd reply in kind.
$C: One can accept the reality that war is a business venture, and not an ideological crusade, while also believing most soldiers genuinely think they are fighting for the greater good
$C: Unemployment rates (U-3) have a cap for how long it can count someone as unemployed. The real unemployment rate (U-6)is 8%, almost double what the unemployment rate the bureau of labor statistics gives out. That is no where near an all time low. 
$C: If its on the news it has to be true.

I dont have the patience to explain everything I want to and its unfortunate because you might benefit from it. Just remember the media has an agenda. The unemployment rate is FAR from being an all time low. Oh and stop watching so much news.
$C: So that's 0.5/2 on that request...
$C: I know you're joking, but drop the "literally" and that's pretty much true as long as "we" also refers not to millenials, but wealthy elites.
$C: Eh, chalk that up to my ignorance about Canada. But ignorance of America didn't stop them from commenting in the first place, so I guess we're even.

$C: Oh the typical "Just move" catchphrase. If it was that simple, I would, dumbass
$C: I think a great deal of us couldn't be happier, too!
$C: Yes, I completely agree.  Death threats aren't protected speech, and I don't think they should be.  They should be taken seriously.  But that isn't what we are talking about here, is it?  We're talking about calling someone a "tranny", intentionally misgendering them or refusing to use their preferred pronouns, all of which are illegal (to my understanding) under the new Canadian bill.  This is an overreach.  Doing those things certainly makes one a rude person at the very least, but unlike making actual threats of violence, *they should not be illegal*.

If I'm incorrect about the bill itself, I'm quite open to correction on that.
$C: I know what you are trying to get at, but your premise isn't correct.  It *is* the government that throws people in jail.  The judge who decides your fate, and the court that holds your trial, and the legislative body that writes the law **are all directly a part of the government**.  Obviously there is not one individual "government" boogeyman arbitrarily deciding to throw folks in jail, but it is indeed the government that writes the law and punishes those who break it.  Who else would it be?
$C: Ahh my feelings! GO TO JAIL!😭😭

ADVICE THIS GOOD COMES ONCE IN A MILLENNIA AT BEST 
$C: You're right about lack of options, although the number of participating insurers actually went up between 2014-2016 (slightly down from the peak in 2015) and started dropping significantly in 2017. 

[KFF](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/number-of-issuers-participating-in-the-individual-health-insurance-marketplace/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D)

But what Trump is doing is purposefully exacerbating the situation to make ACA crash and burn at our expense. 

> President Donald Trump's decision to halt payments on subsidies for low-income enrollees is likely to send ripples through the market. Under the Affordable Care Act, marketplace insurance companies are required to lower deductibles and prices for doctor’s visits and other services for many enrollees. Until now, the federal government has picked up the tab, reimbursing insurers about $7 billion this year alone.
> 
> In 2017, 58 percent of all marketplace enrollees received cost-sharing reductions (CSRs)—in some areas, almost all enrollees did. Insurers are still required to reduce costs for these roughly seven million enrollees. Without the reimbursement, insurers will have little choice but to hike rates or decide to not offer plans at all.

[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/health-insurance-marketplaces-for-2018/)

And Trump's claim to reform:

> "Many Americans lost their plans and doctors altogether, and one-third of the counties -- think of it, one-third only have one insurer left.  The insurance companies are fleeing.  They’re gone; so many gone.  The House bill to repeal and replace Obamacare will provide you and your fellow citizens with more choices -- far more choices at lower cost".

My Premium has more-than-doubled. 

Edit: Btw I'm not downvoting your responses, this shit is complicated and hard to parse and imo worth it to discuss. 
$C: Healthcare premiums spike EVERY YEAR PERIOD.  They did before the ACA.

>It has little to do with Trump and most to do with the system being purposefully set up to quickly ramp up the premiums whilst being anti-competitive.

Actually no.  Trump's refusal to pay for cost sharing commitments is directly raising healthcare premiums.

>Rate increases in Arkansas will be roughly double what they would have been had the cost-sharing subsidy funding continued. The average premium at insurer Ambetter will rise 21.4% next year, instead of 9.9%, the state insurance department said Friday. Arkansas Blue Cross Blue Shield will boost rates an average of 14.2%, instead of 7.8%.

>Pennsylvania regulators said Monday that rates will jump 30.6%, on average, rather than the 7.6% hike that was expected had Trump continued funding the subsidies.

>"This is not the situation I hoped we would be in, but **due to President Trump's refusal to make cost-sharing reduction payments for 2018 and Congress's inaction to appropriate funds, it is the reality that state regulators must face and the reason rate increases will be higher than they should be across the country," said Acting Insurance Commissioner Jessica Altman.**

It's an embarrassment to the Republican party that they supported his candidacy.  They thought far right , anti-constitutional amendment policies were more important than molesting children.  They were wrong.
$C: That’s too idealistic and susceptible to high level corporate collusion that would abuse the consumer.

The repeal of NN means the ISPs will gradually take things away, not politicians.
$C: Are you seriously going to tell me that there wasn't another Republican that didn't have some level of 'shared stance' with Obama on the issue?
$C: We could string voters along with the “worth a shot” line. 

People have been constantly throwing shit at walls forever, and some shit sticks. Voting can’t be that hard, if you can’t get your heart to it just do it half heartedly. 
$C: ^ lol 
$C: So you didn't vote for Hillary? You caused this. You are the problem. If this net neutrality issue bothers you, admit your voting mistake and modify your actions next time.
$C: I could have just not voted in the primaries then. I'm a registered Republican in a deeply republican county. The only way I get a say is if I'm able to vote in the Republican primaries. Voting in the Democratic primaries would have no effect. The best I could do was help deepen the RNC party divide.
$C: I mean, the electoral college strayed from the popular vote though
$C: I hope calling me pathetic makes you feel better.
$C: I feel sorry for you 
$C: Really we didn't. An honest election would have put Bernie in. Just like honest democracy would legalize weed and take killing power away from cops. This "democracy" stuff is a load of fucking bullshit. The best thing we can hope for at this point is alien life intelligent enough to vaporize all the politicians (except Bernie) and implement direct democracy through decentralized data transfer like blockchain. 
$C: I've been a supporter of internet freedom groups like the EFF for a long time.  I disagree that this issue is only about tiering and peering. 

Have to agree to disagree, I guess.
$C: I acknowledge traffic tiering and rate limiting are important issues.

But am I the one conflating internet freedom with net neutrality when reddit is promoting websites named KeepTheNetFree and BattleForTheNet?
$C: Someone else said I was conflating net neutrality and internet freedom.  Which is actually a fair point.

I replied asking, am I the one conflating net neutrality and internet freedom when reddit is promoting KeepTheNetFree and BattleForTheNet?
$C: What is net neutrality to you, and how did the vote today impact the enforcement of net neutrality ideals?
$C: I see reddit posturing nobly about a free and open internet and at the same time I see them acting somewhat less nobly in other ways.  I also see these issues as related. That's where I'm coming from.
$C: I don't think it's a different movement.  I have always considered privacy as an internet freedom issue, and profiting from data mining is milking the consumer in other ways.  I don't want to see these other issue forgotten in the fallout from a fight between Verizon and Level 3 on one side and Google and Facebook on the other.
$C: And if Google decides to derank your website?

I believe there is merit to considering social media networks as important to this issue.  
$C: > How is reddit not practicing NN?

**There are multiple cases of Reddit admins throttling individual posts - most recently Judicial Watch had posts Shadow-Banned on a thread they created in a popular subreddit. Multiple instances of other posts locked at 0 upvoted artificially despite massive support (most recent was a mockery of HRC).**

- Reddit has a near monopoly in content aggregate / voted-forum field and they are using it to promote Astro-Turfing (see r/politics) and arbitrarily blocking some subs from reaching r/all while allowing the opposite political opinions to spam r/all all day from suspiciously tiny disposable hate driven subs. Putting their thumbs on the political scale is a violation of Net Neutrality principles.

- u/spez himself ended up participating in direct editing of comments he disliked. 

- Leaks of Reddit admin discussions show clear political bias and demands for activism from lower level mods towards the top tier. They demand outright banning of all political opposition, and so far are only allowed to throttle.

- This very annoucement promotes obvious astro-turfing of the Net Neutrality issue. If Reddit admins wanted to support a political issue neutrally - they should have first hosted a debate allowing equal exposure to the competing ideas. Instead they promoted the "organic" takeover of multiple subs all spamming the front page. They only allowed such behavior because it was their political opinion - when opposing opinions get that much r/all access, they get throttled. 

Net Neutrality is the principle that a company providing a service should treat all users EQUALLY and promote EQUAL RULES FOR ALL. It should be blind to the political aspect of any content that does not directly violate the law of its host jurisdiction. 

Instead Reddit admins are clearly corrupt and biased and as such their demands for Neutrality from ISPs is hypocritical. 

It is particularly laughable considering the FTC regulates ISPs and Neutrality lawsuits prevented past challenges to the principle, while Reddit is entirely free to mess with its users with no oversight (yet). 
$C: k. Do you even Survivorman?
$C: I never made any terrorist threat. I gave an opiniated statement that, alough goes against popular train of thought, is protected by the first amendment. Please try again. 
GOOD DAY BOIIIIIII
$C: *starts stroking own cock* omg yes! Perfect!!
No, i did not make a threat i gave a suggestion. 
"This is what we should do" vs "we are meeting on thursday to" or "im going to" are completely different statements. 
Bro omg *stroking cock so hard* 
Ive been doing this for years, ive been to court over this multiple times and guess what? *cuuuuuuums all over your mom* never ever ever charged once
Slip in my ass with that big cock boi. Hit me hard with them knowledge you think you know. 
You. Aint. Shit. 
You are part of the problem in which i speak, a blind sheepling that couldnt figure how to put 2 and 2 together without the nipple of the government propaganda in your mouth. 
Edit: further more, instead of being part of the solution you instead try to justify a false claim inside your head because someone on the internet had a different opinion than you. 
$C: Oh i believe you man i'm not saying you specifically do, just that Americans have a certain bravado that they identify with. I believe confidence is huge so its not a bad thing to act like you have the biggest swinging dick in the hurricane, its just we could really use some walk with that talk right about now.
$C: Just because he's brown, you're saying u/ILikeRedditAWholeLot is a racist?  That's pretty presumptuous reasoning there bud.
$C: Btw, a truck in that tight of a space would have been much more deadly than his random spraying..

Thankfully he didn't plan a truck attack.

But really, that attack which you brought up, is neither here nor there.. this is about principles.
$C: I never claimed to be free choice. I'm anti 'my neighbors destroying themselves and bringing me down with them.' you want to be an antisocial anarchist fine, but there will be consequences. 

i just hate how parasites prey on people. cigarettes, alcohol, gambling, all exist because people give zero fucks until its too late. then they want help. i want that help to exist but i also want to eradicate the source of the woes. smoking kills. it should be an industry that we laugh about ever existing. and dont even get me started on the sugar industry. 

i dont have all the answers but if i want to be a whimsical little utopia fairy where everybody has a doctor and an accountant, then i cant be all 'be an alcoholic and piss away your money at the slots cuz well catch you when you fall, its fine.' 
$C: You are basing this on the assumption the website is ONLY hosted on an american server.

This is false for ANY bigger website.

$C: Ok. Thank you for your help 
$C: You failed to seek out her message. Many other people got the message and foresaw the distinction between her and Trump. You gotta take accountability sometime.
$C: I'm gonna kill your mom with my big ol dick how bout that gaywad
$C: > due to the fact that the FCC requires a minimum of two representatives from each party

Trump brought back a democrat on the FCC after their term expired, if you didn't know.

FCC chairman is an entirely different choice, with no party restriction.
$C: God I hope you're a troll. If not, I'm disappointed your family hasn't offed/disowned you yet

Thus, blocked. I'll leave you with [this](https://splinternews.com/here-is-the-final-popular-vote-count-of-the-2016-electi-1793864349)

$C: Sorry if I came off as hostile, I was just trying to explain that it is really more of a bidding war between major corporations.
$C: great thats 2011, this is 2017.
$C: Obama appointed Pai.

edit: also could you please show me the numbers to support that %?
$C: um no he didnt lol. he just said both sides are to blame... you are the one that just stated dems aren't as "bad" as republicans as a fact 
$C: .....
Literally incapable of understanding I'm talking about longterm corporate strategy to capture regulatory agencies.


And this is why comcast wins.
$C: Obama could have refused. Ajit Pai isn't some random person. I know maybe you think that way because you just heard his name like a year ago.

Obama also literally appointed Tom Wheeler, who at the time had the same EXACT views as Pai.

This angered the hell out of democrats who supported Rosenworcel as the chair.

You know, a life long proponent of net neutrality and NOT a comcast lobbyist.


Now you're lying by omission in suggesting Obama didn't stack the deck with players to help the regulatory capture of the FCC.
$C: Yes, I'm aware of the 2011 vote: https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2011/h252

I'm also aware that funding shifted towards President Candidate Barack Obama for the cable industry to attack it from the executive branch's side.


Since you're not interested in realizing it's about buying branches of government.
$C: .....

The references are to his 2012 bid and his 2013 inaug. You didn't even look at the links.


Wow. Congratulations. You literally are doing what comcast likes: tribalism and don't bother caring, just party lines! 


Next when they rebuy democrats (democrats were the top donors in '08, the first push against net neutrality through congress that almost passed), you'll be quiet like you were when they tried to it under Obama in December of last year.
$C: tl;dr obama sold us out, but we don't give two fucks, because D~~!!!!!!

Even if they turn around and don't ever support NN again, we don't care, we'll vote democrat till we die.

Ok. I bet you will never vote republican, regardless. So you're literally what corporate america banks on: the stupid democrat voter that will let the regulations be applied quietly so the equally stupid republican voters can pass the provisions that really benefit corporations quietly too. It doesn't matter if you're more noble in your intent, you are equal to Trump voters because of how stupid you are in the long-game.

So congrats, yes, you're as partisan and dumb as a republican in the long game. I don't care if you think you're more 'moral', you contributed to this fuckery equally knowing the republicans would take your regulations and abuse them so you're actually WORSE than they are because you KNEW they would.

You're a dog owner who puts a steak in front of dogs, leaves the room, then gets mad the dog ate the steak. You're WORSE. Republicans might act out of great ignorance, but you **know** strong government gives the republicans the ability to set the rules in their own way, yet you still give to them. YOU ARE WORSE. YOU ARE LITERALLY THE WORST BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR ACTIONS WILL CAUSE.

Wow, congrats, you're bullshit diatribe of democrat repeated nonsense about 'false equivilency' actually makes you more garbage than the republicans who act out of greed and ignorance because *you should know better*. But you pretend like you don't. So wallow in your shit, because you're worse than the worst conservative - you granted them this power with your god king emperor Obama. Enjoy it. Worship it.  You caused this. If not for you, Trump would have less power.

So enjoy that an independent totally rejects the democrats and hopes they get SLAUGHTERED in 2018 to figure out some semblance of neoliberalism again. Progressivism is a cancer and the socialism is eating the democrats alive. And yet you smug, self-absorbed shitheads can't get of your pots long enough to realize American doesn't want a single party house/senate/president/court/state govs. But we have no choice.Yet you won't internalize and go "wow, we better adopt a more liberatarian stance or else we'll continue to lose state house/senate seats". Nope, you can do no wrong. Well enjoy losing. Because you're great at it. You won 1 special election in a DECADE, and barely against some fucking pedo. 2018 won't be kind, and you'll be here on reddit, crying you're goddamn eyes out, instead of just embracing neoliberalism like you should be.


 Also, all economics academically support 'conservative' economics (in the traditional sense).

So you're off base. No economics goes "man, those democrats are great!" that is serious. Because their arguments are stupid garbage economically. Argue for *humanity*. We should do stupid economic things for *humanity* sake. Not for overall wealth.

Because overall wealth is strictly a conservative thing. Now be educational.

Also Clinton was a neoliberal, aka neoclassical, aka REAGANITE in principals. If you want to return there, cool, that's great, but recognize you're a 'trickledown' person. 


Jesus the lack of education is insane.
$C: Username checks out. That was cancer
$C: I'm sure you did
$C: Hey at least Hilary’s VP choice isn’t violently against who I am as a bisexual woman.
$C: Oh you don't exactly agree with me on everything? Have fun being stupid, anti-science, discriminating, bigoted, literally evil, and wrong about everything ever!

--How it seems people feel about me as a mildly conservative person

Edit: and no it doesn't push me super to the right, and yes I see the same attitude from the right, but that doesn't make it better.
$C: That and the conservative media has decided any discussion whatsoever is a war on ___ values or anti-___ regardless of how true it might be.

Net neutrality is anti-competition. End of story. You don't have to think about it any longer, trust us your friends that it is against what makes America great because the Democrats want to sell you to the Chinese. 


$C: That's a bunch of bullshit. He succeeded because a majority of people don't do their own fucking research, they put zero thought into the action of voting, likely due to the little weight they believe it holds. It has nothing to do with people reacting to being talked down to, and everything to do with why they'd be talked down to in the first place.

Roy Moore got 48% of Alabama - is that due to people's overwhelming love for child molesters, or simply because of the (R)? The fact that no one would want to vote for a child molester but he got half of the vote kinda proves my point on people not putting any thought into their votes. They're fucking stupid for doing so, and me calling them stupid might make some think twice in the future.
$C: Not to mention that banning guns doesn't even reduce the number of murders. Check UK stats.
$C: I'd love to see where you are getting your numbers. Not that I disbelieve you, I'd just rather trust scientific studies over strangers on the internet.
$C: "Woah you have a gun? why do you have a gun? I am an upper-middle class suburbanite or downtownie who doesn't like the fact that i am responsible for my own safety"

"Also what are race/iq/crime statistics that's just racist"
$C: So now it's legal to just kill thugs.

Now you're gonna say "show me where I said that it's legal to kill thugs." 
$C: I support firearm safety and gun control. 
$C: Ah, I see. No defense, so completely avoid what I said. You really are a true believer Democrat, you're the exact equivalent to the idiots on T_D on the other side of the spectrum.
$C: you will eat these words too
$C: Same to you fuck face
$C: The argument is already apparent. Net neutrality is important enough to me to warrant supporting the political party that supports it. That's not the case for the other person. Nothing to argue because we're at an impasse so might as well tell him to go fuck himself.
$C: You're directly replying in response to someone who stated that the parties are now basically the same. Yes, I'm ignoring all of those things you pointed out, but with good reason. I'm ignoring them because in my opinion all of those things you point out are completely off base and not at all what the person meant by "they're the same."
$C: You have your viewpoint set and I️ have mine set so arguing is futile. 
$C: Yeah a little
$C: That’s what I’m saying. I don’t care anymore about moral high ground. I just want to punish the people actively working against my interests.
$C: Wow, the internet is a scary place.

Also, physical_removal had all reasons to be, well, removed, because people don't go "let's kill <random_people> because they are ranting about us on the internet" normally.
$C: Trump hired him to HEAD the FCC.

Pai then got rid of Net Neutrality.

Obama simply made him a member of the FCC **on the reccomendation** of REPUBLICAN Mitch McConnell. 

Again, you're wrong. Sorry my friend

But hey if you want to use zero logic and blame obama go ahead. You'll just be wrong. 
$C: >I classify my self as a reublican, that doesn't mean I agree with or defend the actions of others in the same party. I hope you understand that.

Republicans wanted this. If you voted Republican or consider yourself one. You enabled this. 

It's pretty simple. 

Thats why people vote for politicians. To get stuff done. 

Republicans are in power, they supported this, they hired pai. This is on them. Who voted for these people? Republicans. 

Sometimes you just need to own up and say "my party fucked up, I wish they didn't do this"
$C: No, I realize that, but p2p traffic is largely piracy.

[From a 2011 Study](http://documents.envisional.com/docs/Envisional-Internet_Usage-Jan2011.pdf), we know that on the bittorrent side, the ofthe  top torrents (they looked at 10,000 of the most shared), almost all the non-pornography content was infringing copyright law - as in about 99.9%. This was across films, tv, games, software, music, books, etc etc.

I've certainly used p2p in legal ways too, but lets not fool ourselves into thinking that the majority is non-piracy.
$C: You didn't post the follow-ups to any of these...they were all handled under the regulations that were in place prior to 2015. Which completely undermines your argument. The repeal of net neutrality in its current form would make no difference in the final outcome of these violations.
$C: I'm sorry, but someone who supports infinite detention and torture ***IS A PRETTY FUCKING HORRIBLE PERSON***. 

How the hell did I go off the deep end ***BY CALLING A HORRIBLE PIECE OF SHIT SCUM WHO SUPPORTS INDEFINITE DETENTION AND TORTURE THE HORRIBLE PERSON THAT THEY ARE?!!!!***

It's not "off the deep end" to get mad at torturers. 

It's "off the deep end" to decide that torture is ok.
$C: Heh
$C: Regulation always favors the "megacorporations" and kills small businesses. Grab a book on economics. 

We have tons of regulations now, yet we still have these monster corporations.


$C: As I just showed you, no.
$C: You do realize that the internet was without NN here until 2015, right? Whatever, eat up all the hype, work yourself into a feverish pitch of hysterical screeching about it if you want to, I'll just be here doing the same shit I always have, for the same if not less cost.
$C: I didn't realize "mocking" was your new term for hating people enough to kill them. but nice swing.
$C: How about you understand they issue violent threats all the time:

https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7a4bjo/time_for_my_quarterly_inquisition_reddit_ceo_here/dp6youa/
$C: Like I said, hes scared. He feels attacked constantly because the only things, the ONLY things that are happening right now, are things that fuck him over personally. Its scary shit. All I'm saying.
$C: Was that shooter conspiring on Reddit to do so? Did those anti-Trumpers conspire on reddit to torture that kid? Did that bomber conspire on reddit to set off a bomb?

The fact that you're trying to change the subject with whataboutism isn't helping your point.
$C: Sources please.
$C: Eh, the only one of those who you can really tie to the American left is the first one. They're all scumbags, but it's not like they're all democratic party activists. 
$C: Oh right. Wait what are you referring to with the 10 minutes?
$C: You seem to be missing the point I was making.  I couldn't care less about arguing the topic with you.  It's all said and done.  I was merely pointing out the ridiculousness of your situation: being so sure of your position without even having the faintest idea of what the opposing argument is.  And apparently without having put even the slightest effort into finding it out.  The links are there to show that there is, in fact, a well articulated opposing argument instead of the 'Muh Trump supporters' that you seem to have conjured up in your head.  
  
But don't despair, you have plenty of company on reddit, with people just like you who are following the herd wherever it takes you without question. 
$C: I suppose the idea of an internet existing, and said internet being neutral, is nice. Sadly, assholes like the OP (/u/spez) do not live those values in their own lives, far from it.
$C: It's jumping the gun. Never a good thing.
$C: Hahahahahahah
$C: They blocked other companies or websites in the past 
$C: They're still getting paid, aren't they?
$C: Hundreds of thousands of ACCOUNTS, not people. They regularly evade bans by creating new accounts, and then they tack that subscribe onto t_D. This has been going on for well over a year. Look at the controversial sort of any r/politics posts that hit the front page, theres dozens of alt-right posts by usernames that are just random strings of numbers. Its a constant revolving door of fake posters.
$C: What does repealing net neutrality have to do with who Twitter or Reddit ban?  Milo violated Twitter's terms of service, which he agreed to when he made his account, and got shitcanned.  Reddit banning communities dedicated to hating specific groups of people is fine too.

you don't pay for "faster access" to individual websites, you pay for a faster internet connection, but if net neutrality is repealed you might be asked to pay on top of what you already pay to prevent your ISP from throttling your connection to those sites.  is that what you wanted?

What incentive does the government have to go after ISP monopolies now?  Net neutrality doesn't even address that specific issue with internet access in the United States.
$C: Then don’t use the sites you don’t agree with. That’s pretty simple. 
$C: Don't forget the way they collaborated and conspired against the Daily Stormer and other dissident far-right websites to keep them offline for the naughty thought-crime of "racism", while taking no similar action against the numerous leftist antifa websites calling for literal violence (complete with doxxing of enemies)
$C: [deleted]
$C: Milo was banned for coordinating harassment against Leslie Jones.  Why wouldn't they ban him for violating the terms of services he agreed to?

the_donald being barred from the front page for obvious algorithm manipulation is also fair.

Facebook and Twitter don't silence conservatives.  You can click any trending topic and find a litany of pages and people commenting in support of conservative views.  If anything, the article you linked shows how Mark Zuckerberg stepped in to stop potential censorship because he didn't want to politicize Facebook.  Almost like you linked an article with a title supportive to your argument and hoped people would just believe.


$C: What tinfoil hat bullshit did I just waste my time reading?
$C: So this is clearly the future you're encouraging. Where the ISP itself can do the exact same thing, but instead of on a single website, it can censor an any and all content relating to a certain creator (like Prager U). Good idea. 
$C: Where was that attitude when gay marriage was legalized, or when the travel ban was struck down?
$C: I know. Go play in a sandbox somewhere. 
$C: > I hope he gets tortured to death

Because your Netflix might, hypothetically but probably not, get more expensive. Sort your fucking priorities out.
$C: An implied threat is still a threat. They take these things very seriously.
$C: Probably. What exactly did spez do you by posting the news?

And yeah, he also disabled all inbox mentions, so he won't see any of what you're commenting
$C: Bad bot. 
$C: He knows, he's just defending himself with nonsense because he was called out.
$C: keep the straw man thing going. I am sure there are plenty here on reddit who will appreciate it. 
$C: Neat. 
$C: Has anyone really been far as decided to use even go want to do look more like? 
$C: Loool. 

The mindless drone failed to gain self control.... Control reverted back to his corporate overlords.
$C: >given the facts, along with the majority of this country

Argument ad populum in an attempt to intimidate and belittle. Obvious psychological trick.

> that repealing net neutrality is an assault on free speech.

Reddit's format is literally an assault on free speech.
$C: I apologize, I meant more rural in comparison to blue states.

Well, in addition to it not being that great relative to other developed nations, the more rural an area, the worse it gets. 

I actually briefly discussed this with another redditer recently who was in the education profession.
$C: Alabama election results. Or do you think 9 random women decided all at one time to come out of the woodwork? And before you retarded make some comment about the yearbook, she annotated the thing, not forge it.
$C: just saying he's not a Doctor... of any sort. 
$C: Look at you whining about it. My *opinion*, as you say, is that you talk big shit while continuing to rake in as much cash for you and yours as you can. You're welcome to have that political view, but I'm going to call you a political hypocrite. 

Why don't you start paying for your own support systems and in line with the rest of the country, you free loading "lifer".
$C: >Ignores majority of context.

>Provides cherry picked irrelevancies to prove nonexistant point. 

Sounds like a southerner to me. 
$C: Your farms aren't valuable, you're costing the country billions. The subsidies you soak up are insane. 
$C: "Muh valuable farms". 

Oh god, whine some more please. You don't own those farms. Monsanto and other mega-corps founded by coastal elites do. You farm using our developments and we will eventually replace you with robots. 

News flash, square acreage as a measure of personal value stopped right around when we forced you to give up owning people outright. Get with the times, whiner. 
$C: Nah he picked flip floppers, who did vote right the first time.  He was on board the first time when the law passed in 2015 to make 25mbps be the baseline for broadband internet nation wide.  Which was the right thing to do.  
$C: Well it usually does, so pardon me for thinking the latter.  Uhc works in all other great nations friend. It can work for us
$C: Lmfao its politics thats common place routine. Oh boy ya found out the dems do what the reds been doin. Gtfoh
$C: >None.

Glad we agree, but still, my question was how /u/Spez can justify himself saying he stands for a open and free internet, while his company openly censors people, and he himself is guilty of using backend tools to edit users posts. 

If you think it has nothing to do with what in essence the entire argument over NN was, then you are lost.

Yes the legal ramifications have  nothing to do with ti, but that didn't stop people from running around crying about "but but what if a new YouTube comes out and they charge more!" 
$C: You're getting down voted, but if you look at the deleted comments on the Donald in NN threads it's not hard to come to the conclusion that you have.
$C: The home of the brave?
$C: I can't tell if this is serious or not lol
$C: My response was to this assertion:

>The_Donald is full steam censoring any comments that criticise the repeal and it's users are responding as they normally do.

-

>holding a bag of dicks

That's where we disagree.
$C: >and the rhetoric getting more angry

Says the guy who posts in /r/politics. The subreddit that has been calling for Ajit Pai's beheading or whatever else your small imaginations can come up with all day. But they're not getting more angry, rhetorically, nah. It's almost like you are incapable of seeing that there are two sides to the coin and everyone has been pushed more partisan. But I repeat myself, I already said you were on /r/politics.
$C: Cheese pizza? What's wrong with liking that? Maybe he's a pineapple pizza kind of guy, I guess? I like pineapple pizza. Where's the incessant part? Why did he edit comments where a user simply stated reddit is failing? 
$C: Do you mean like reddit called Alabama Republicans pedophiles?
$C: Anita Sarkeesian playbook
$C: >Abuse

Lol, that's adorable
$C: Ahh, so "muh free speech" is okay for you, but not for anybody who disagrees with you?

You think namecalling and feefee hurting is "abuse" that should be censored, do you? Should we start with all the virtuous tolerant regressive leftist losers who "abuse" Trump?
$C: Honey, all I did was paraphrase what /u/Spez has said and done


$C: He clearly doesn't, tho
$C: Yeah, he's just the CEO or something of an incredibly powerful corporation. But he's not an ISP.
$C: Yeah, that's not an argument. You're just insulting him. Doesn't exactly change my mind that NN is censorship if you're only capable of dehumanizing and trying to censor anyone who doesn't support it.
$C: Wrong, He admitted to doing it on multiple occasions literally in his apology you dolt
$C: What? He said that that's not what nn means, he is right, what you wrote had anything to do with nn. 
$C: Fact: Reddit (the company) pretends to care about neutrality and freedom, while the site is literally built around censoring communities it doesn't agree with, and literally built around popular opinions (upvoted) reaching more and more people and unpopular opinions (downvoted) reaching less or no people.

Fact: Reddit is the exact opposite of neutrality, yet pretends neutrality is important
$C: Non argument.
$C: So what have you done? Are you just going to take it? I came up with a solution for people like me... And I know there are flaws. But I didn't come here as a genius. I came here to offer some insight and say what im doing to fight it. I feel like comments like yours are part of the problem... I feel for you. I totally understand. But it feels like you came here to tell me specifically that my type of protest won't work because it doesn't work for you. That's super counter productive and probably exactly the attitude that lead us to this apathy. Guys. WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT. WE CAN WIN. But not if you don't want to. 

So random redditor, I challenge you: FIND A WAY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. 

And you know what? if you can't help fight the FCC, pick another injustice and fight *that*. I'll help you fight the FCC, and I'll help fight for people like you who have no option. 
$C: ... what?! do you... what?! Enjoy your 3$ gaming package I suppose. 
$C: What paedophile do you think I love?
$C: Me <----

The Joke <----

You <----

Bernie's Chance of Being President <----
$C: i don't see this as a good thing. why charge more for people that already pay taxes, a home and so many other things? this is avarice at its finest. think about the millions of college students who are already broke as shit. i don't see any pros to this (unless you count companies gaining more $$ than they already do) and i don't see why there are people who do. just my p.o.v
$C: > Of course repealing it isn't in the platform. 

Exactly.

>You think they would actually put "repeal the 2nd Amendment" in their platform?

No, because that is literally not the position of the Democratic party. Lots of Democratic senators own guns.

>They don't call it "repeal the 2nd Amendment", they instead use the misleading catch phrase "common sense gun regulation".

Those are entirely two different things. Why are you conflating them?

>but to the majority of the Democrats "common sense" means "legislating the 2nd Amendment out of existence"

No it doesn't. I'm a Democrat, and I don't want to repeal the 2nd amendment. I've also never met a Democrat who wanted to repeal the 2nd amendment.

Seriously, stop watching Fox News. It's corrupting your brain and putting you into a world that doesn't exist.


$C: Alabama went to a democrat. That's a 30 point swing. 11 months. 11 months until Trump is a lame duck president. Not that he's doing much now. :)
$C: Did you eat paint chips as a kid? I know mommy and daddy did everything for you growing up but now it's time for you to be responsible for yourself. I provided a good jumping off spot for learning more but I don't have the time or inclination to hold stupid people's hands. If you lack the wherewithal to simply Google the decision then you aren't just uninformed you're willfully ignorant and I have not a second more time for you.
$C: Nothing under cuts facts. If you want to remain willfully ignorant that is your choice. I know there is nothing leftists hate more than knowledge 
$C: Comcast is a great company that provides a great product at a reasonable price.  I've never had anything but good experiences with them.
$C: You mean how my comment talking about being a happy Comcast customer has been downvoted?
$C: Lower taxes, booming stock market, 40,000 manufacturing jobs added since Trump took office, ending TPP, new trade deals with allies, net neutrality repeal, and the dismantling of the Obama presidency.

The guy I voted for is doing exactly what I wanted him to do and he's doing it at a very rapid pace.  My political philosophy is winning sport, you're just a butthurt asswipe that gets a weekly posting on /r/iamverysmart.  I bet you didn't even know that one did you?  Lolz
$C: Yup, giving the government more power to censor is a great thing. 
$C: Can you explain what's good about it?
$C: > So you're okay with monopolies and corporations sucking every dime out of hardworking Americans who have no other options in their area.

Yes.  As I said before, internet access isn't a right.  I shouldn't have to subsidize your access to it just because you can't afford it.
$C: > Bold statement to make while online

It's not.

I know it's hard to believe but millions of people don't have internet access and they are just fine.  
$C: > It literally is a necessity in today's world.

No it's not.

>It's where you do the research necessary to pass high school or university.  

I did just fine using a library.

>It's where you go to find job offers and apply for work.

Newspapers, employment agencies, etc...

>It's how you keep up with current events, including emergency information.

Daily newspapers and television.

>It's how you communicate with your friends and family and know what is going on in your social circles.

Picking up a telephone works just as well for immediate contact.  


>Internet access absolutely is a necessity in modern developed societies.

See above...  it's not.
$C: That's the price of doing business.  
$C: I'm not implying that this is their fault directly but they've perforated our entire executive branch and severely compromised the stability of our government. Which is a good thing for them. Also I don't hate Russia, but we are trying to fill the same niche thus they are our competitor. Any destabilizing factor is good for them. Which I would say this is.
$C: I’d love to live in my own fantasy world like you do.  
$C: That's an interesting site, thanks!   And yeah, bias is inescapable, it's human nature.  The goal is to prevent your own biases from clouding your judgment, or stop you from listening and learning.  As long as you understand your own biases, and don't let yourself get weighed down by them, I think you do fine overall.
$C: >herpy derp durr
$C: God you are *really* bad at this
$C: I'll refer to my previous comment. Every pick would be a piece of shit with the same agenda so what's the point
$C: Something, something, revolution.

$C: *Yawn*. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Your own citation gave the end date to several of these problems you retard
$C: No it wasn’t, AOL is a good example on why they weren’t doing that. AOL died. 

Maybe you should read the 300 page net neutrality. Instead of reusing buzz words 
$C: When the post was only an hour or so old, it was gilded with a positive karma score in the 100s. I would imagine t_d was early to the party and the rest of Reddit showed up organically and downvoted them into oblivion.
$C: is it not to send him a highlighted message?
$C: Do you need me to explain what circumstantial means?

There is no solid proof, just circumstantial evidence. I said that in my post you fucking bellend. 

> You're surprised a largely left wing website has a lot of left wing mods? Are you also surprised a lot of Chinese people commit crimes in China?

No. I'm surprised a supposedly neutral politics sub on a largely left-wing site suddenly removes mods of many years and replaces then with a new bunch of fully left wing people around the time Hillary & Co were spending millions to 'correct the record' on social media. I'm surprised the sub basically changed completely in a matter of weeks and rags like Salon were now allowed instead of being called out for the biased waste of bandwidth they were. I mean, Shareblue itself and Mediamatters make up half the submissions there nowadays.. are you kidding me?

It might shock to learn that before this mod change and CTR/ShareBlue crap politics was fairly neutral.



$C: You accidentally posted this comment twice but this just gives me a reason to give you another upvote.
$C: The bigger irony is, he made a separate account to shield his internet points on his main account.
$C: Oh this is where you’re confused, you see, I don’t do this because it’s “important” I do this because it’s fucking hilarious. Especially when I post something benign and then a libtard sees my username and replies with some really triggered shit. God damn other people's anger is great.
$C: Well I guess you get it then because almost everything I say is really just a joke, which just happens to trigger the right people :)
$C: You forgot literally Hitler. Never forget literally Hitler. Classic mistake liberals make is not calling a trumpet a nazi at least once. It adds to your sense of pride and accomplishment and really makes the opposing side think deeply about your argument. Now try again.
$C: You don't have to be a bot. You just have to be dumb enough to be convinced by them. So that puts you in the same basket as your fearless leader. 
$C: I said propaganda not bot. Whether you're the one starting the propaganda or falling/spreading it I don't care. Can you read?
$C: That doesn’t contradict my ability to embrace reality, but yeah, sure, let’s go with that!

I’m a sad, demented little child that’s laughing his ass off at the largest mass triggering since Nov. 8th 2016. Oh, it’s glorious.
$C: Why tf would you want to go back to r/politics?
$C: Did you read the name of the person making the appeal?
$C: I have seen Republicans make a lot of comments there without getting removed or banned and the banned user has LGBT in their name but sure they are totally biased.
$C: inb4 *"yea, but is there any REAL proof?"*

$C: Interference does not equal collusion. About one year and $300 million into the investigation and there's still nothing. I think skepticism is understable here.
$C: It's a stupid fucking source. What the hell did OP expect.

Jesus h finnegans.
$C: Lol you serious? I'm not one that needs self gratification in proving my own point.
$C: Don't you get it!

Whenever any of the 400,000 TD subscribers comment in a subreddit that isn't TD, it's brigading!  There's no way they'd find a stickied announcement on their front page by themselves!!!
$C: So now you guys are arguing against higher wages? And you call me crazy? You're flip flopping on the same issue because the guy making it happen doesn't have a D next to his name. 
$C: Keep changing the meaning of words. Now what does that have to do with our current conversation? You have no argument, so you cry about anything else. 
$C: We're doing better recovering than ever before. That said, [have another one.](http://dailycaller.com/2017/07/13/shortage-of-foreign-labor-forces-maine-businesses-to-hire-local-workers/) Perhaps all of this illegal immigration will have a positive effect on the black community, but who gives a shit about that right? 
$C: >Not to mention the annulment of the Paris Accord.

So you didn't read my post. 
$C: **Whataboutism**

Whataboutism (also known as whataboutery) is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument, which is particularly associated with Soviet and Russian propaganda. When criticisms were leveled at the Soviet Union, the Soviet response would be "What about..." followed by an event in the Western world.

The term "whataboutery" has been used in Britain and Ireland since the period of the Troubles (conflict) in Northern Ireland. Lexicographers date the first appearance of the variant whataboutism to the 1990s, while other historians state that during the Cold War Western officials referred to the Soviet propaganda strategy by that term.

$C: So it's the old talking point handed down from the Kremlin.
$C: You are "criticizing" the left for something they supposedly do which is in no relation to the topic at hand. 

Talking about Person X breaking the law, you jump in saying "well yeah, but person Z broke the law too", isn't actually contributing to the conversation and is just an attempt to distract from Person X
$C: You did. Nobody fell for it.
$C: I've edited my post, if you want to take a look.
$C: "Liberal" is a catch all. The left is at war with itself. The progressives and moderates* are fighting. The neoliberal/centrist leadership is instigating this conflict. Demanding that all dems should step in line or else. Treating those with opposing views/constructive criticism as enemies. Calling their followers "moderate dems" and claiming they are progressives when they are not real progressives. Pretending these people are the majority on the left, when they are not. 

The right on the other hand (is no good imo) but they are at least working together. The corporate dems are for moving toward the center. They think this is the only answer. They're even willing to alienate progressive dems and independents they need to win elections, to do so. They're trying to beat the republicans at their own game with big money and it is not going to happen. Their base simply won't have it. 

 
$C: I've since edited my post. 
$C: Maybe but it's the truth. If you ever argued with a troll or ~~shill~~ PR person, you would know this. They move goalposts like no other.
$C: >Those videos are stupid

How are they stupid?

>In the first one it clearly showed that he couldn't post because he didn't subscribe to the sub.

I'm pretty sure that is a normal notification everyone gets when they are not a part of the sub. Yep, I just unsubscribed and posted a news article and had no problem.

>The person who made the video then doesn't understand why archive.org would be listed as a rehosting site. 

But he understands that real clear politics isn't and that's the point of the video. Let's try to focus on that. 
$C: That's likely, but we aren't talking about t_d. They are a safe space echo chamber. r/politics is not supposed to be that. Politics isn't even a genuine echo chamber, due to the convo being influenced/controlled. 

It is anti-Trump/Russia content 99% of the time. What happened with the media during the 2016 primary is what is happening in the sub. The pro-establishment narrative is to keep people focused on Trump/Russia angle and pedophile Republicans. No moderate/corporate Dem or DNC criticism allowed!
$C: >uranium one is bullshit

**THEN LINKS TO A YOUTUBE VIDEO!**


ahahahahahaha.


So because a conservative originally funded makes it okay that hillary did it.


You kids are fucking retardedly bad at shilling
$C: it can always get worse
$C: Sure, I must be brainwashed to come to a different conclusion than our all-knowing libertarian messiah. I'm actually quite open minded about these topics, and I'm not the one demanding ideological purity from others. 
$C: Government "regulation" is where most of your liberties comes from... 
$C: That's not a real argument though, but ideology. Some regulation increases freedom, like designating certain lands for the public, some regulation decreases freedom to offer other advantages like security and stability. Not being allowed to murder people certainly decreases my freedom, but still seems like a fair trade-off. 

NN btw. is part of the first group, it may decrease the freedom of ISP's, but increases the freedom of consumers and smaller businesses. I still haven't heard a single *good* argument for the repeal.
$C: Look at this cuck, folks.

***SAD***

$C: Nah, usually republicans gets downvoted hard in politics, i'd suggest the red states welfare slacktivists to use neutralpolitics but they never do since you have to post sources in every reply there.
$C: I enjoy the trump bashing in politics as much as the next guy, but freeloading and slactivist are way off base.
$C: They count when president fuckass talks about the unemployment rate.  Weirdly, people who have given up on finding jobs in this shit economy don't.  Hmmm...
$C: My bad, that's the saying, but my phone is on military time.
$C: That's just a really long way of saying no, you don't have anything credible to support your theory that admins and mods were paid off.
$C: You spend a shocking amount of time on a website you claim to hate.
$C: So you have no support for your claims?
$C: If you’re not some edgy 14 year old kid then I feel really sorry for you and the mongoloids that raised you. 
$C: You've got a pretty severe case if autism dont you, skamp? 
$C: It's kind of hard to take you seriously when half of your account is posts like this. Maybe you should reply to this comment saying "reeee faggot" to set me straight? 
$C: Haha, god you're a faggot
$C: Are you ok?
$C: Geez, that must be a boring way to do reddit. Just copying and pasting the same string of gibberish over and over. 
$C: I didn't say that you specifically said this. I said that enormous numbers of people on Reddit said this.

Hyperbole is a category of misleading statements, with a vague border to outright lies. If you accept that Reddit was screaming with _hyperbole_, then we're far closer to _lies_.
$C: Your link leads nowhere relevant.

>**Tell me why they've lobbied so hard to get it removed**

What is your source that they have "lobbied incredibly hard to have it removed"?

If you're going to make a reference to donations, please separate out the part they donate to politicians ordinarily and for any other political purpose, from what they have specifically donated for this specific purpose.
$C: Didn't know antifa was an official arm of democrats. Huh, TIL
$C: Careful, your oppressive dictator side is showing.

Seriously, that kind of talk is north Korea level of oppression. Get that shit out of this country

$C: I can't even reply to this because it makes almost no sense.
$C: Will do! Sounds yummy!
$C: They have a whole subreddit full of these posts!  The worst part is, some people will be fooled!  Some will be convinced!  Poe's Law tells us that of the hundreds of fake accounts, some real people will be convinced!

I need to get off the fucking internet!  I never thought this site I joined years ago would be such an egregious example of the SHIT of humanity forcing their agendas on all the rest of us with no thought or concern to what's best for anyone!  FUCK.

Fuck Ajit Pai, fuck Donald Trump, I want to kill the president, I have bombs, CIA, NSA, Watergate, wikileaks, kneecaps, banned words, ~~Mein Kampf~~ (that's probably a positive phrase to them), fuck all this shit.
$C: Good point
$C: Correlation with government doesn’t help. Maybe use you gray matter buddy.
$C: Yeah I think they admins are literally allowing and permitting calls for violence against political figures. That’s fucking disgusting, I don’t care who you are who or you want to hurt. 

/u/spez is a cuckold, slack-eyed, drooling meatslapper of a cunt whose existence is a bleak and worthless stain on the earth; he should die and slowly choke on his Cuck’n Crunch cereal next morning. 

(Not really, I just want to see this get removed so I can laugh more at their hypocrisy)
$C: Source for that? Not saying I don’t believe you I just can’t find one and I’d love to save it. I just get every biased trash news telling me only white trash hicks voted for trump while everyone else voted for Killary. 
$C: Lol did Trump tell you that?
$C: Yeah they are voting for the people that will actually try to help them rather than the monsters that won't. 
$C: No, but it sure don't work without the hardware.
$C: >  They do not have a monopoly on the infrastructure, land, and service coverage for massive regions in the US like Comcast and Verizon do.

They have monopolies on web traffic, and are the gatekeepers. 
$C: And social media are the gatekeepers/monopolies of discussion, the modern day town square. Verizon and comcast never censored me -- twitter, facebook, reddit, and youtube/google all have.

If you don't have a presence on them, you don't get any traffic.
$C: I've been censored plenty. My subreddits have been banned and defamed in media, and I've had my passwords changed on prior accounts when there was another head of community at reddit. 
$C: >My water company doesn't charge me more based on what type of water.

The electrons that go through the copper wire for your internet signal are the same as your neighbors. Even if your neighbor is paying more than you; or vice versa. Just like water.

So again, just like water - you use more, you pay more!

HOORAY! YOU GET WHY no-NN is good!
$C: That's what no NN allows for! Hooray!
$C: Maybe take it to Facebook

They love whiny little kids
$C: Oh no I didn't read some kid's rant

The world is ending
$C: Did you read the NN rules being repealed?
$C: oh for sure, but the outrage i see today is something i wish i saw a year ago and i guess i'm jaded now. plus this is still a fight that can be fought in the courts, but still. wish people thought ahead and not only about themselves.
$C: Oh okay, where's the evidence then?

*That's what I thought. Baseless claims.
$C: I am losing my time, which has value.
$C: > I don't care about your thoughts and views, I was stating a fact that NN will most affect sites in the shit tier of the Internet.

And I don't care about yours either. Are you dense enough to believe I would keep reading your opinion after a statement like that?

Here something you can think about 

-Net Neutrality is dead

-Trump is the President

-The Trans Pacific Partnership was destroyed

-We left the Paris Climate Change Agreement

-Trump let the Keystone pipeline be built

-Trump removed all the Obama regulations on the drilling

-The Wall Prototypes are done and being tested

-The tax bill will pass this week with major cuts into OBAMACARE

-Refugees and Illegal immigration is being cracked down on

There is nothing you can do about it and its only going to keep changing. Enjoy the next 7 years under Trump soy boi


$C: Going in there and calling republicans nazis and retards is not having a different political view its being an annoying asshole and last time i checked subbreddits can have their own rules and fucking reddit itself should never censor something  because its not part of their agenda this is the type of shit YouTube does puts random fucking videos on trending   blocks anything they want freedom for the internet? how about we fucking get freedom for reddit first these greedy pieces of shit on Facebook Twitter and even Reddit don't give a single shit about NN it won't effect them trying to look like the good guy or and you people buy it ... Freedom For The Internet because the Internet isn't free if we pay 3$ more and companies like YouTube can't abuse their users anymore no censorship!!!!! ofc only for the things i agree with anybody with different political views must be banned and shut down ?1?1?!?!?!?!?!??!?
$C: Omg that would make me so happy, I only go on this site to fuck with people 
$C: That's a silly, childish argument, because all things aren't equal. You had one job to do, and you failed miserably at it.
$C: yeah thats because no one is enforcing anti trust laws

what you are reading is sacre tactics to convince you to giove the us government control over the very tool that we use to expose them

there have never been nor will there be pay for site access

its a red herring

$C: No, its because your stupid, and believe so much that your correct that your defending the lives of dispicable people, and you are so arrogent that you have no idea how wrong you are. So much so that your completly altering what im saying to fit your misconseptions. Because you cant even fathom to grasp that a guy who is paying elected officials to ignore the votes of his citizens he swore to represent, doesnt deserve to breath anymore.
$C: > ISPs could already throttle.

No, they couldn't. The FCC voted to allow them to.
$C: The white supremacists need net neutrality in order to spread their propaganda. With this change, their movements will die off. This is arguably the biggest civil rights victory since 1964.
$C: you know my response. PEACE OUT NN, HELLO LAWSUITS FOR GOOGLE, TWITTER, REDDIT.
$C: Hahaha soros helped  nazis capture his fellow Jews and you take his
Money while calling other people nazi. The irony 
$C: No, it means it has to treat every major website the same. 

Do you honestly think that all of these major companies have your best interests at heart? Do you honestly think this isn't about their bottom line?

$C: Stopping porn and other bad stimulations while starting meditation decreased the symtoms enormously. After that I changed diet and poof, it's like my ADHD never even existed.
$C: simple. the government dictates how I earn MY living. unnecessary legal forms need to be done yearly, costing unwanted legal fees. i have to deal with government and black suits constantly, just because of the business i run. can't wait to see them, the bureaucracy, the government overreach, and the exorbitant legal fees go.   
$C: *crickets*
$C: i've been far from duped buddy. i advocated in 2011 and 2012 when the idea of NN being government controlled was first brought up. just the talks killed investment by several hundred million dollars. i was against it then. and i'm against it now. today, innovation and investment can be unleashed once again. 
$C: simply a small ISP owner wanting the red tape and black suits to stay out of how i run my business, thank you very much. this has absolutely nothing to do with Trump. 
$C: If you were responsible you could. And has there ever been a boycott over the internet? Maybe you should try it before you knock it. Boycott campaigns are successful if applied and promoted correctly. But Entitlement 
$C: 1) you obviously dont know how boycotting works. So we’re done here.
Get off reddit Bernie.
5) Companies already run the government. Its called Crony Capitalism for a reason. And most of them push liberal propaganda through their Media outlets. So how is this a Anti government republicans issue?
$C: So you don't have a single cell provider to switch to? That sounds unlikely.

"At least it's not the government" is a perfectly valid argument, because you and corporations don't owe each other anything. If you don't like how a corporation works, you can do it better. You can find something better, you can create something better, or you can deal without. You are entirely free, just like them. If you don't like how the government works, well suck it up. It's the law and they will use their hired guns to enforce it.
$C: Yea My bad. 

I do know what net neutrality is and I also know that the 2015 "NN" isn't really net neutrality. If you are open to learning more/or seeing the problem from the other side I would suggest watching 1791L's video about it on YouTube, it's all factual and very detailed. 
$C: That’s pure projection, but I expect nothing less from a brainwashed idiot
$C: Uh... the section covered that.

>In 2011, Pai was then nominated for a Republican Party position on the Federal Communications Commission by President Barack Obama at the recommendation of Minority leader Mitch McConnell. **He was confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate on May 7, 2012, and was sworn in on May 14, 2012,** for a term that concluded on June 30, 2016.[1] Then Pai was designated chairman of the FCC by President Donald Trump in January 2017 for a five-year term.[16] He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate for the additional five-year term on October 2, 2017.[6]

I omitted nothing.  You had to read more than one sentence to find it is all.
$C: He was chosen and effectively nominated by McConnell. The comment is correct.
$C: No, I mean, earn less. 

$C: The head of the FCC was an Obama appointee. Just saying.

And yes, they are totally the same.

$C: 75% of Republicans are against the repeal.

Mhm I do always love your deflection when a little girl is torn inhalf by some subhuman African you imported by saying well hey were happy


$C: Yeah, I keeping hearing this argument, but it doesn't make sense. Democrats are for Net Neutrality; Republicans are against it. Democrats are against a tax cut for the wealthy; Republicans will gladly cut education and other vital programs just so their wealthy overlords can pocket more money. You think Hillary would have pulled us out of the climate agreement? Or got into Twitter fights on a regular basis? Or continually have made incendiary comments to any and all of her perceived enemies? There is no equivalency here. This both sides are the same myth needs to die.
$C: Downside of a Republic: an idiot’s vote counts the same as a smmart person’s vote. Which do you think is easier to influence? It was assumed that the Internet/Instantanious communication would usher in a golden age were all people were able to access any information. 

Instead we have been swamped with disinformation and our senses overwhelmed with an unending onslaught of fear mongering.  
$C: Don't know why you're downvoted, but here, have an upvote
$C: Workers of the world unite!
$C: False. The concept of an open and accessible internet has been how it has been ran since its inception. Don't spread that false shit just because the *most recent* change in policy was 2015.
$C: >Technology *allows* us to be facists, so that's what we'll do
$C: Thank you
$C: I’m very much so aware. 

Free market only works when monopolies aren’t allowed. 

A capital intensive infrastructure such as the internet is automatically no longer a free market when government allows it to monopolize. 

NN takes away some power from those monopolies and attempts to simulate a free market condition (when in fact, it’s not). 

By repealing NN, you repeal the free market condition, and monopolies get to do whatever the fuck monopolies are gonna do. 

Case in point: my current choice in Internet is Time Warner/spectrum. 

That’s it. 

That’s the only provider legally allowed to provide access to me. 

They can fuck me as hard as they want. The government (who caused the monopoly) also prevents that through tools like NN. Which is now gone. 
$C: Sorry! You can't JUST get Facebook access, we package Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, myspace, and an assortment of social media sites you have never and will never use for the bestValue™
$C: It was the worst icing on top I've ever fucking seen. 
$C: And what about the businesses who get shafted by this? The ISPs can slow or stop traffic to their sites. You do realise that it is going to be boning businesses? You also realize that more people are going to be uninformed? Ever think about crime rates? That'll definitely go up for a while because we can't afford to use the ISP's "private services" as you say. I'll break it down.

-If they slow porn sites down or make it more expensive, rape rates are likely to go up due to sexual frustration. 

-People may take to stealing so they can pay their bills for decent internet. 

-This can lead to infrastructure failing due to many jobs needing internet to function. If the infrastructure fails, we could easily fall into anarchy with no solid control. 

This could also lead to a few job issues. I'll break that down too.

-IT workers (a lot of them) use the internet to get their jobs done. If they don't know the fix themselves, likely it is on the Internet.

-Teachers need to find worksheets and/or access their grades. Since internet will cost more, you have a couple possible outcomes:

---Schools become run down as they can't get a grant but need to keep internet up

---Teachers get paid even less or even laid off due to monetary constraints

---Taxes go up so they can keep maintained, internet, [[[and]]] teachers. If the taxes go up too much, the people in poverty become even poorer.

Back to job issues:

-Students need internet to keep informed, do some homework, as well as learn.

e.g: Friend of mine's little brother is in a program at his high school (The Math & Science Center, in the US) that has a Computer Science class. He doesn't NEED internet at home, but its really useful as a lot of his course is online.




Sorry it got so long, this is just something I'm REALLY passionate about.

$C: It takes a long time and alot of money to do what Google is doing . You could try to see if you have an ISP in your area that supports NN
$C: Or ISP's lobbied them the fuck out of dodge like what Comcast did in Pennsylvania
$C: It's fine you doing so helps me realize my mistake 
$C: I don't think he can.
$C: He has bodyguards
$C: Well.... With your thought process if youre ever a piece of shit you should be beat down in the street. So I might think someone's a piece of shit for being rude to someone who works in retail. So we should attack anyone who's rude to people. Alright that'll really make things better. 
$C: Not a single reason to believe that.
$C: Periods dude.  

And just because neutrality was the status quo during the early Internet does NOT mean it will be so in perpetuity.  NN was established precisely because providers were making moves to dismantle that neutrality.  


$C: All I'm saying is that 

> we might as well repeat it now so we can hurry up and blah blah

is broken logic.
$C: Really? I don't find either of those archaic. They're one of the few that I thought were still in serious use. I'll have to check my Garner's Dictionary.
$C: Eh, it’s more of people who are further left or further right on the spectrum. You can hate both parties, that’s not hard to do. But you can’t logically say the dems are as bad as the republicans. They’re both bought out but the republicans have their masters hands so far up their ass you can’t call them human, they’re living puppets. 
$C: Yeah I guess thats true
$C: That is what I say. People often think of you are a Democrat you automatically believe everything they say, or sometimes they will go tribalistic and assume you are the enemy. Same goes with saying you are Republican.
$C: Politicians are all shitty, immoral, life long lying pieces of shit, but i do enjoy chuckling at people who think their respective party stinks less so I suppose you can carry on.
$C: And that’s why gerrymandering is bad kids
$C: Please show where i denigrated democracy? 

Was it because i used the term "constitutional republic" instead of "representative democracy" or "constitutional democratic republic"? theyre the same thing, right? I just used the first term that came to mind. 
$C: Republicans - “We’ll accept telecom campaign contributions and vote exactly how they want us to”

Democrats - “We’ll accept telecom campaign contributions, but we won’t vote against the public good”

Morons - “Both sides are THE SAME!!1!”

$C: Here's a tactic: [meshnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_mesh_network). However, at the moment it is not a sufficient replacement for ISPs and the wires in the ground (and across the ocean). However, if the internet becomes *completely* borked, then if we have meshnet at least we'll still have some connectivity.

Another tactic: [neutrinos](https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/08/after-43-years-gentle-touch-of-a-neutrino-is-finally-observed/). Neutrinos can pass through the entire Earth unimpeded. If the technology to emit and detect them develops enough that a "neutrino modem" would fit in someone's house, then potentially anyone could start an ISP, and without infrastructure costs or requiring their customers to live on the same continent as them.

However, that's a long ways off. If we want neutrino modems, then we'll need to get more people interested in doing neutrino research.

Until technical solutions are developed, we're going to have to keep fighting legal battles.
$C: >Woah woah woah. I don't doubt it will work. It DIDNT work. 

And it will DEFINITELY not work if we don't do it. We knew it was a slim chance anyway, but that's why we even wrote in the first place.

>I'm *clearly* asking for a better tactic. How the hell did you miss that? 

Because you haven't asked for one. Bashing a tactic doesn't imply you think we need a better one. Just that you don't like this one.

But explain something to me. *Even if and when* we come up with other tactics, why not *also* write? There's no reason I couldn't both write and march. Or write and run for office myself. Or write and do any number of other things.

>As for the hostile stuff, I'm sorry if I give a shit. I'm make sure to bring Disney movies and a glass of milk and some cookies next time. 

You can care about something without lashing out at those on your side. You can be both passionate and diplomatic. But you're not. You *for some reason* see that as beneath you. Your anger is not a virtue, it's an obstacle.

>The time for nicey nicey letters to santa has passed. It's time to grow up and do something that has some weight to it.

##Like what?

This is where you need to provide alternatives. I already provided two: march and run for office. If you care so much and want a solution so bad, then brainstorm!


$C: Pointing out that we shouldnt use the same tactic that failed last time isn't whining. It's just being logical. At the very least my comment is painfully obvious and therefore boring. 

Only a delusional hopeful or someone who stands to gain from the repeal should be saying call our reps. It's flawed. 
$C: "if we call our reps" ahahahahahahaha good one.
$C: r/killthosewhokillotherpeople
$C: Are there ten million people who might?
$C: Yes it does. You being entitled doesnt mean that boycotting wont work, it just means you are a greedy gluttonous fuck that can live wihout fast food or porn for even 24 fucking. Your a sad fucking person man. Done wasting my time on shit like you.

Literally half the world lives without internet, according to you they should all be dead right now, because we cant survive with no internet.

No, we can survive, we just cant all drive BMWs and stuff your faces with McMuffins for breakfast and Pizzahut for dinner while we all sit in our separate rooms wih our 5 separate TVs and eat supper even though you own a perfectly good 3000$ dinner table.

Yep. Definitely an issue with survival and not entitlement.
Get real m8. Seriously.
$C: If you want to be safe you have to fight.  To not fight is to die slow.  All he labels they toss at us in the world won't matter when their head is in he guillotine.
$C: Yeah, a bunch of people standing on the steps flexing their muscles and going "huh? how about NOW?" is *really* gonna make them change their minds.  They're totally not going to ignore that like they've done every single other time in the history of this country.  No way.  This time it'll work.

They don't live in the same world as us.  They are insulated. 
$C: This is why we can't have civil political debates.  People like you assume the other side is evil rather than just a human being with a different opinion.  Hell, we don't even disagree, I'm just trying to point out that the issue isn't black and white, yet you call me a liar.  I hope you find a way to talk more respectfully to people in the future, because people like you are the reason we can't have civil discourse.
$C: >could be shown to have changed that chairmans vote

Nah, I think that cunt was going to sell you all out regardless of the payment. I'm confident he could stand up in a court and say "I was going to fuck America over regardless" and it would be the truth.
$C: I mean, I'm not intent on censoring anyone. I just like to know where things are coming from. However, you make a good point, and it's definitely not a good idea. Thanks for your opinion on it, and I agree, it is immensely frustrating when they start gaining ground on literal insanity.


$C: >I don't like promoting mass tagging because eventually someone will use it to actually censor them, like some subreddits instantly banning people for posting somewhere they don't like, 

Which happens all the time
$C: Oh please. Could you be more melodramatic? I'm not looking to put a badge on the_dipshit users in the real world, nor am I looking to downvote them simply based on them posting there. It's about context. If someone posts an idiotic thing, I still want to understand where they come from. Knowing they're regular posters there gives some context, since I've spent plenty of time reading that sub to try and understand where they're coming from.

But but but lirburls are hitler fema camps Killary Killton soros conspiracy etc vaccines chemtrails blah blah false flag Pizzagate soyboi takeover MAGA!

Whatever helps you sleep at night, bruv.
$C: I'm sorry you feel that way.  Best of luck to you.  I hope we can eventually go back to respectfully disagreeing on the issues again, with respect for each other as people still intact.
$C: There's no good reason for an ISP to approach Reddit for negotiations but require an NDA on what would be discussed.  The very act of requesting one would be enough to indicate their intentions.
$C: Most people in the US cant pick their ISP.
$C: I know they do.. and yet it somehow propelled them into one of the top news channels. The people thinking this is a good thing most likely use it as their #1 news source (aka the current president).
$C: Ok, I've been looking for conservatives, offline and online, who are opposed to gutting the NN rules.

I've yet to find any.  All of them are like,"Trump's said he's going to MAGA, and this will MAGA."
$C: Where else should we look to see how conservatives are reacting to it?
$C: Man someone should really make a bot for this.

$C: If only reddit had some feature that limited the amount of karma negative comments take away!
$C: It don't be like it is but it do
$C: but what I'm saying is that even if they slow *everything* to 1 Kb/s it won't matter this way because 1000 * 1 Kb/s = 1 Mb/s in effective data transfer.


For simple information sharing sites or even text based forums (like Reddit) that's more than enough. It doesn't solve everything but it could be a start or at least a decentralized base for information sharing that cannot be slowed.


I hear you that the infrastructure wasn't designed originally for it, but nothing really starts out designed for something that's new. That's the inherent nature of newness.  
$C: Blocked here in the states too. 
$C: Not all of the VPNs, no. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: it's closer to a tunnel to a device in another location through which you can get internet access
$C: If only it were that simple...

It takes all your info, encrypts it and sends it to a "VPN provider", who decrypts and relays it to the original destination. This hides the sender from all next nodes, including government interceptor or the destination server. 

As far as your ISP, all they see is that YOU (identifiably) sent stuff they can't see. With net neutrality gone, they don't have to let you do that unless you pay a TON, because it allows you to send anything to any server. That would force net neutrality on them.
$C: Secure work from home over a VPN. Or in my case to access my school's server to do my schoolwork in a virtualization class: With the VMs running on their server.
$C: University students use a VPN all the time to access scientific journal articles from home. 
$C: People work from home too. Remote employment is a very big thing in 2017. Those people would be screwed.
$C: I work from home and use a VPN.   I set up a IPSEC point to point tunnel with a few of my friends as well.   Why should some companies dictate who uses VPN's and who doesn't?
$C: Realistically, they’re far more likely to pass the cost on to the consumer rather than have to handle billing for billions of websites, plus hire new customer support to assist them, etc. There are really two ways ISPs could get greedy here


1. Pass the cost on to the websites and block or throttle anyone who doesn’t pay. 
2. Pass the cost on to the consumer and charge them extra for certain services.  

While scenario 1 would be far more dangerous, scenario 2 is far more likely I think, since it’s a lot cheaper to implement and maintain. It’s still not good, but it’s not the doomsday dystopia scenario 1 would be, either. 
$C: > The ability to use a VPN is an extra $1,800 a month as of this hour.

huh? I just checked a bunch of the free VPNs and they seem to still work fine. I think you're getting ripped off if you're being charged 1,800$/mo. 
$C: Not really. Building an ISP is phenomenally expensive. It's also a natural monopoly (which has a specific meaning that might not be what you think it is if you're not familiar with the term).
$C: that's the ole plausibility pleading standard case

$C: And they know full well the regs can come back as easily as they were lost.

$C: Except that the people fighting for guns are the ones who want less government. Those fighting the 2a would love for Uncle Sam to run their life

$C: Blame first past the post.
$C: Both parties have different concepts of freedom/liberty, negative/positive rights so they're both campaigning for these different concepts in each issue.

Quit trying to make Republicans look bad, were all in this together, right?
$C: No. Not nearly all reps are against NN. I'm Republican, my physical and online friends are republican, we all support NN. I can think of very very few reps who are against NN.
$C: Yes. Abandon the left. It wouldn't be called the right if it was wrong, right?

$C: I’ve seen some examples of this so called reasonable free speech, it’s not very reasonable. Even if it was the sub is clearly a Trump fan club, saying anything that could even be considered anti-Trump will probably get you banned, and their mods have the right to do that. If I go into a leftist sub and don’t fall in line with everyone else, I’ll get banned. I know this because it’s happened to me multiple times already. 
$C: Imagine being this retarded ^
$C: Just like in the real world, no one is terrified by you. You're the neighbor that has domestic quarrels at 3 in the morning, parks in everyone else's driveway, and pisses on your own front lawn at halftime on a sunday...oh wait, you're boycotting Kaepernick...

But no one is terrified over the aging jackasses. Just disgusted by the classless ignorance that is a temporary - but annoying - obstacle to inevitable progress.

Heck though, Putin had a lot of criticism for America today, but nothing but praise for Trump. Putin's an oligarch who wants to join forces with a single party America. That's what you wanted, right?
$C: Yeah, sure. Whatever. I'm sure plenty of criminals have Reddit accounts.
$C: And Doom killed all those kids at Columbine

$C: Yeah I hate the altright but  it more than just the_donald. uncensorednews is worse, they are white nationalists pretending to be a news source
$C: And Doom killed all those kids at Columbine
$C: You are correct.  And it goes this way for so many things. Someone saw some nonsense on tv over and over, they tell it to family, friends, and people repeat it back.  Now you have a bunch of people going around like that against what would really be good for them and the future of their children.  If we could just shut off the tv until sanity and honest reporting returns.  And we will have to insist on it.  This internet fight may be the most important of all along with removing corrupted politicians who work for corporations instead of people. 

We must all keep talking about these things to anyone who will listen.   
$C: I must've blocked them myself manually ages ago and forgotten I did it, then.
$C: Jesus fuck you need some reading comprehension skills then. All he said is that he wants net neutrality regulations, but through the correct channel of *Congress*, not through the FCC. How is that difficult to understand?
$C: Which ones? Be sure to specify the ones that mean NN doesn't matter.
$C: HAHAHAHA! So, Corporations rights are unlimited, but people's rights don't matter? The rights of small start up companies don't matter? Ethics don't matter? The will of the voting public in a democracy does not matter?

That is some boot licking.

You don't mind having news cenceroed, information censored, sites throttled, and small companies put out of business because BIG Companies Bribed their way into unseemly amounts of power?

It's like you are unaware of Regulatory Capture, or why it's bad, in almost every case.


$C: Question: would it be acceptable, in your view on how businesses should be governed, for a local power company to decide that it doesn't like giving power to homes that contain Jews or Muslims and to disconnect those homes? What if they, owning the power lines and poles and servitudes that allow them to exist, decide not to let any other company run lines to those homes using the discriminating company's infrastructure.

This is a good outcome? Or should there be an intervention to assist the discriminated group? 


If we allow intervention here, why not to protect other interests otherwise limited by the monopolistic powers inherent to certain industries (like net neutrality)?
$C: You made some off hand remark about giving the FCC more power, and I pointed out that this is the FCC choosing to not exercise power it already had. Like most other things in this administration, Trump's appointees are dismantling the agencies, not strengthening them, for better or worse (usually worse).

Why are you like this?
$C: Well said!
$C: Thanks, obviously my understanding was a bit lackluster, this clears a couple things up for me.
$C: [deleted]
$C: >>vague banalities that make no sense 

>>insinuations that you're incapable of basic analysis 

>>insults to combat well-reasoned arguments

That's why nobody said a word about politics at Thanksgiving.
$C: Lol you post to the the_d and just sound pissed that you can't astroturf without being called out. Go back to gagging on that mango dick and calling the jizz liberal tears you fucking pillock.
$C: Imagine your phone company blocked all of your phone calls to your best friend because you were talking shit about a political candidate they wanted in office. That's what Title II was created to prevent, and it's the reason your phone company cannot deliberately block you from calling people. They can't edit your text messages in transit, they can't distort your voice before it gets to the other party, and they can't stop you from calling your best friend to talk shit about Trump. 

They can sure as fuck do that on the internet now, though.
$C: > Why?

Because that's the issue being put forth right now. There's no large FCC debate about local municipal broadband that's front and center in political media, but there is a large FCC debate about Net Neutrality. You're asking us to ignore what people are actually talking about to push some other agenda.
$C: So how would this work? Realistically?
You expect more smaller ISPs to pop up. K, cool. Sounds good for the sake of competition, right?

Except it will NOT go that way. Perhaps in a dreamworld, but not right here in reality.

Setting up independent networks locally has an immense initial cost. And then, what? Big ISPs can just offer cheaper internet in that area, undercutting the prices of smaller independent ISPs that may pop up. So small ISPs can't compete and fail. In return the big ISPs can now just jack up the price for, whatever. Whatsapp data usage or something, all over the country, to make up for the cost of undercutting the new ISPs. After all, they can provide internet everywhere, and smaller ISPs can not.
This is also why smaller coffee shops will not exist anywhere near Starbucks. It is not viable, Starbucks can afford undercutting prices to cause another business to go out of business.

Then there is the problem of how the internet operates. Big ISP has a ton of servers with all of the internet on it. They can just block smaller ISPs from accessing that, or extort for money. Thus resulting in multiple versions of the internet, different in size and community. Because of ISPs also potentially putting limits on which news you are allowed to view, it becomes a tool of brainwashing, not free speech. It is fuvking scary.

THAT, is why it is not a good idea to give this much freedom to the big ISPs. In an ideal world the competition would be awesome. But it will not realistically happen.
$C: Murder is illegal because of government regulation. You're a special kind of person aren't you?
$C: The ISP's have been caught abusing basic net neutrality before it was official by blocking or throttling legal traffic in order to promote their own products. They misbehaved and shown that they will continue to do so. Net neutrality rules needed to be in place to stop this. They have proven that they cannot self regulate.
$C: exactly. You handle shit like this by doxing Ajit Pai's public records. Where he lives IS public record. Making that information easily accessible is what doxing is about. Then, if a bunch of clowns take him out for a night behind the woodshed its on them. A beating or five would do ajit pai's attitude a world of good.
$C: Wow I made a typo but of course you spend your whole response on that instead of actually responding to what I said. I mean if your gonna split one liners at least be able to back them up. And I’m the one with brain cancer? And where did you get libertarian from? 
$C: > OOOOOOOOHHH! So... BECAUSE he is the biggest, open, obvious idiot to NOT vote for, you'll just go ahead and vote for him anyway. obiwangoodjob.gif

This country has a lot of problems, and some either aren't going to get addressed, or will be addressed in such a halfhearted manner that it will be marked as "done" in the social consciousness and no momentum will ever bring it back to the debate floor again.

What exactly do you think would have happened to net neutrality under Clinton? I wager nothing. It would have sat there as an FCC reg. It wouldn't be repealed (not yet), but it wouldn't be codified into law either. It would sit there until the next GOP president, when it would be repealed at that time.

At least doing it now with Trump, it can be lumped in as one of his horrible policies, so when the inevitable backlash comes, it's more likely to be reinstated, and with stronger protections than being an FCC reg.

I don't trust the democrats to do the right thing unless they get a sharp kick in the ass. Electing Trump, and allowing him to show all the possible abuses of the system, gives Dems the proper motivation and gameplan. Without him it would be business as usual, and quite frankly I'm sick of what was status quo.
$C: >Hillary being repeatedly brought up as a whatabout by those who are seeking only to say, with resignation, that everyone is equally corrupt. That's false.

Once again, that was not the point of the reply.

>A rigged primary is far from our biggest problem right now, and shouldn't consistently be fallen back on as a lens to say "Oh well shits broke"

How the hell do you think the voters could possibly get a meaningful piece of legislation that protects themselves without being able to elect a person themselves??

If we can't put someone in power that represents us then we don't have the support from within that makes changes, how do you not see that?

This is even off the original topic, the point is, we didn't do anything about corruption then, when it was a huge fucking deal, then there is the probability that we won't do anything again when we see corruption in effect on a lower level.


$C: >We paid for the infrastructure expansion you fucking moron

No, no we really didn't, lad. 

>In the same way that we might invent great things oh, i dunno, like the fucking internet because we broke apart the enormously powerful

The internet was created as by the military as a research tool, not because we broke a monopoly, friend. 
$C: Is that why Verizon covers like almost every populated place in the country?
$C: >Sure, maybe a fully corporatized, private marketplace can create some healthy competition in urban metropolis' or otherwise well-populated areas.


Sure, let the market handle itself, instead of discouraging ISPs from expanding and upgrading.

It would be like if Fedex and UPS built their own roads. If we take away their power to control their own created roads.... They would be heavily discouraged from building more roads, and heavily discouraged from upgrading old roads
$C: > Tell me, when corporations are big enough to set their own prices

Tell me, is it bad when companies set their own prices? Or is it just companies you're tantruming about

Also, why can't you answer the very simple question:

>These companies need to be broken up like ATT back in the day and have their regional monopolies destroyed

Tell me, how would that benefit the consumer? Honestly.

$C: > Obviously the people that want to put in their own infrastructure want to maintain control of it.

Duh?

>The problem is they want exclusivity to put in the infrastructure in the first place.

Yes, they don't want to invest in places where they have to compete, also duh. You aren't going to open a donut shop next to a dunkin donuts, because you aren't stupid. 

>I'm a lifelong republican but I vote out republicans

You aren't fooling anyone, lad
$C: Yes, because breaking companies, throwing investments away and ruining entire corporations always encourages investment!
$C: AYYYYYYYYY!
$C: Sorry I dared to disagree with you
$C: I forget that reddit is mostly young barely teens

Then you remind me
$C: You want historical context? The men that wrote the constitution/Bill of Rights were soldiers, captains, commanders and generals in the revolutionary war and knew exactly where the future of warfare was headed. The repeating Puckle gun had been around for decades. Cannons had been around for centuries. War ships had been around for centuries. Absolutely none of these weapons of mass destruction were prohibited by the founding fathers. So yeah, when someone(so far only democrats) introduces a bill to outlaw the sale and manufacture of AR15s it is unequivocally unconstitutional.
$C: That comparison isn't too bad. Ask yourself this, would you want either babysitting your kids?
$C: Dilly dilly!
$C: Dude this isnt france we are going to need more then pitchforks cause they will bring tanks
$C: Let's focus on younger political talent; Bernie's policies are great but we need young leadership. I'm keeping an eye on Jason Kander and Kirsten Gillibrand, myself.
$C: I don't know. My point though is that our voice as people in this republic is at stake and nothing else will matter once they have taken that away. And it will disappear silently, right under our noses, which is what is already happening.

Make it loud and clear that we don't want other fringe issues to get in the way until we have secured our right to have a voice again. Other social reform can wait, because it won't matter anymore soon if we don't act. We are the people, and we should take control of organizations like the DNC when they don't reflect our voice.

I'm just a guy trying to take care of his family, so I'll be the first to tell you, I don't know how. But I know we should be asking, what is the DNC doing right now to rectify that they silenced over half of their constituency? Why aren't the GoP not doing more about this when they are always claiming to be the champions of liberty?

Voting different than we do can help, it will be a slow process, but voting turnout is so low, that if we just convinced those that sit at home on vote day to just get out and make the best decision they can with what we have to work with, we can and will make waves. They want us to be complacent, remember that.
$C: Bruh... Bernie is going to be dead in 2020

$C: Ya raising taxes on the rich. What an awful tax scam.

$C: The loud sound of moving goal posts.  

“I *feel* they’re corrupt, even when I can see in the fucking voting record that they support net neutrality” 
$C: I basically included a picture of my great nephews ( that I raise thanks to the opiate crisis) and explained that my ecommerece business is the reason they can do scouts, go to camp and have nice winter coats ( Ohio is cold ya'll) and that they are taking it from them by doing this. AND TO REMEMBER THEIR NAMES.

The problem is higher than Pai.
$C: Seems about right to me
$C: He's far beyond a 'scammer'
$C: True, but that takes a lot of time and forehead space, and won't be legible from as far away.

On the plus side, it would hurt more.
$C: Ah, but who says I did it for him? :)
$C: Terrorism - the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims. 

Bombing the FCC vote is literally an act of terrorism, American against American, I'm fairly certain a large part of our patriotism is the fight against terrorism.

Am I saying that what the FCC is doing is right? Fuck no. Am I saying we should let it happen? Fuck no. Am I saying killing over Internet policies is okay? No, it isn't.
$C: I'm not saying anything about the military, I'm saying violence isn't the answer to net neutrality, you don't think terrorism/bombing just to get your way about the internet isn't a little silly? I want net neutrality to stay in place, but bombing and killing to keep it, that's not right.
$C: Calling for a revolution and assassination isn't bullshit but saying its wrong and stupid is? no wonder the left likes Islam so much 
$C: If i was trolling i would say something i don't believe in just for the sake of triggering you oh and am i Russian too? or maybe i'm bot beep boop beep boop 
$C: Are you suggestion revolution? 
$C: Well AT&T is apparently into ear stuff so that's just another dick blocking your shot. It's Telecom dicks all the way down.
$C: What do you think is going to happen after repeal? It doesn’t look like anything will change. 
$C: All I'll say is that if I saw his obituary I wouldn't see it as a negative in any way.
$C: your now on a list for threatening violence against a government offiical lol
$C: Yes there is outrage, but at the same time, who is there to step in and say "you can't do that to people" especially when there are tons of places that are only one company in charge. Example, Google wasn't allowed to have Google fiber in my old neighborhood because att had the contract with the city, att was also set to merge with charter essentially making a monopoly in many places. Comcast still does these fast lane practices and just pay the fines because of how big they are, now they can so it without fines
$C: That's what happened with the 2014 Verizon court case, they said ISP are title 1 and thus FCC has no jurisdiction over them at least from my understanding
$C: That there is so much venom in your mind about gender, that when the word itself is mentioned with little to no context you have to insert your own opinion.
$C: Yes
$C: I don't have a lot of love lost for traitors.

I'd feel bad if reporters/the D members of the board were hurt, but I wouldn't feel even a second of trepidation about the 3 voting yes.
$C: Honestly, I'm disappointed a sniper didn't take a shot at Pai before the vote. Didn't even have to go for a killshot, just like, shoot out his fucking kneecap so he might get it in his head that "Oh shit, people really fucking want NN to stay, maybe I shouldn't repeal it."

Obviously, if he went on to repeal still, THEN you do the killshot. On him and the two others who voted with him. So then maybe their replacements will think "Hmm, maybe we should reinstate Net Neutrality."
$C: > They WANT people to get violent if they're going to protest, then they're easy to marginalize and gun down without reproach. If there are peaceful masses who won't move until a problem is solved, there's no way for them to deal with that without looking like the bad guy, which only rallies more people to the cause.

You really think they wouldn't frame a completely peaceful protest this way, if they wanted an excuse to crack down on it? It's been done in the past. Remember how some of the media painted Bernie supporters as violent and unlawful during the primaries, and later it was found out that it wasn't the case? Of course the truth didn't come out until the movement had been marginalized. Remember Occupy Wall Street? Yeah, we saw how much hundreds of thousands in the street helped us there. There were protests from shore to shore, and not a thing was done, and in the end the banks got exactly what they wanted. The people got nothing but a figurative boot heel in their collective face. The powers we're contending with control the media for the most part; they control the narrative. I have no faith that peaceful protest will solve these problems. When literally millions of people are flooding their representatives with phone calls and emails, and even knocking on their office doors, and we still get nothing, and corporate interests get exactly what they want? You think getting in the street is going to suddenly net a different outcome?

I also don't know how you can say, with a straight face, that Americans "don't have the time or persistence," to fight this. Like we're impatient or lazy? We have **been fighting this Net Neutrality fight for literally a fucking a decade**. ISPs have been pushing this agenda since the early 2000's. They've shown they won't stop and will pay whatever it takes to get their way. It has gotten completely ridiculous. Many of us have been in this fight since day one. If we're feeling like we're running out of options, it's because we are. They've taken our options from us.
$C: For something like that to happen, hundreds of thousands of Americans would have to be desperate.  Starving.  Not-cynical.
$C: America is not a dictatorship. The presidential election is not the only person we elect. Even though the presidential does seem to be slightly rigged due to gerrymandering, the electoral college, and the DNC, it is still mostly fair. Hillary Clinton had more votes than the other candidates. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Results_of_the_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries,_2016 Either way, most of our government(house and senate) is directly elected by the people. The House of Reps has 239 Republicans and 193 Democrats. The Senate has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats. Do you agree that the American people directly voted for these people?
$C: You have a right to overthrow a tyrannical government, not the one which does things you disagree with.
$C: When you overthrow a govt, you also forget you’re signing up for decades of instability that none of us want. It’s not like you overthrow a govt tomorrow morning and by next Sunday, things go back to business as usual.

The constitution has given you so many ways to overthrow or undermine a govt. Once those methods have been exhausted, fine. Go for complete anarchy. 

But suggesting anarchy after a presidential election in which 45% of our country didn’t show up is laughable.  Maybe get into political activism. Maybe convince people to wake up & participate in the govt. 
$C: Well, you explained why you think repealing it was corruption. But why do you think the same thing didn't happen when it was first passed? 

In the end, though, ending NN was probably good. It just represents regulation that will make consumers worse off. The internet existed for decades without NN and developed just fine.
$C: Again, you need to heed my advice above about discontinuing talking.
$C: We dont need it, but at least from my perspective one seems to be on the horizon
$C: That's debatable. 
$C: Maybe if ajit Pai gets defeated someday, then someone decides the best way to rub it into him is to break then murder (emphasis on break) him after all (for him) is lost.
$C: Alright I'm just not feeding this any more. I never said civil war and now you are trying to contradict me on the words you put in my mouth.

$C: I know what your going to say worst case is, and that is the total blocking of some sites or business by a company like Comcast. But if you think they could actually pull that off without mass cancellations, protest, and media coverage I’d say your a little confused. 

The internet was strong before 2015 and it’ll be strong after 2018. And the only way a business will be successful in violating net neutrality principles is if they can show that the majority of their customers would benefit(save money) by the change.

$C: We've been in a major war since we became a country not just iraq and Vietnam. 
$C: No, like you said re: Trump, they didn't support Obama or his administration but they obviously supported the status quo of classism and corporate elitism.
$C: While I do absolutely agree that the right is more united, the left isn't *as* divided as you think—in my opinion, anyway. Maybe it's just because I'm a staunch intersectional feminist, but both myself and all of the liberals I know are very unified in our desires. We're as concerned about the things that BLM wants as we are about attacking misogyny and rape culture, living wages and healthcare. I know that there's plenty of division in the left—fuck, look at how hamstrung the ACA was to begin with because of left-wing bickering and capitulation—but I think that a broader sense of unity is starting to emerge, and I hope it's a trend that continues.
$C: ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
$C: Yeah, because you're so enlightened right???

I don't mean this unironically, kill yourself. We need morons like you, and your genes, out of the pool forever.
$C: Okay, yeah, I get your point now. My original point is still that everyone here saying "Overthrow duh goberment!" really doesn't have a functional grasp of what that actually means. 
$C: Are you still not seeing the point that an administration that is satisfying 70% of the population doesn't justify a revolt, where if they're only satisfying barely a third, it might? This whole "last administration" narrative just isn't going to work. A revolt isn't necessarily a violent revolution,  it's just a mass show of rebellion, it can be in the form of a general strike (which is of course what I'd advice first, grab em' by the money).
$C: I get what you're saying, but Pai should not have this kind of power. If congress won't pass a law then we have to do something else. Doing nothing about bad behavior is the same as encouraging it. If things break down and there's fighting in the streets so that we can prevent things like this in the future then I'm fine with that. I'll even go out there and get bloody myself. Am I angry? You're damn right I am. But what makes me more angry than anything is seeing one thing after another like this, it's all the same. Over and over again it's just an attack on all of us, on our ability to make a decent life for ourselves. I am not afraid of fighting and dying in order to make something better. Living this way and waiting for them to slowly take everything away from us is just a slow death anyway.
$C: No, but I can guarantee you have a very poor or twisted understanding of functional governments if you want 0 taxes.
$C: And I suppose this ideal government would be funded through some sort of magic that materialized money out of thin air?
$C: True, but generally that's how it plays out in most markets and is the accepted theory. Like in the US, our Telcos could do the same thing but don't, because usually not screwing the consumer results in better profitability
$C: Now I’m intrigued. How would ending NN, which keep in mind was only implemented two years ago, suddenly end the internet due to its repeal? 
$C: Alright. Usually I vote in a way that suits my values and that I believe will benefit myself/family best. 
$C: That was an 18 day old account. You got baited. 
$C: What’s wrong with you? 
$C: Yeah it is called Extortion instead, I did try to to make that distinction, and it is definitely politically motivated. 
$C: Well, it's as if the whole thing is a teetering, worm-eaten pillar of shit and the companies need to go down too.
$C: As long as the accusations are credible, as the ones against Moore were, I would never vote for a pedophile, alleged or proven.

I'd love a perfect world where our candidates are half-decent human beings that just have different views on how to make things better for everyone, but I acknowledge that that world doesn't exist. A candidate's character is definitely something I'd look into before voting one way or the other.
$C: Now you're misreading my post lol. Obama didn't put Ajit Pai in the FCC, he nominated him for a Commissioner Position on the recommendation of McConnell. Ajit Pai was a member of the FCC before Obama was ever even elected President. He worked his way up through the FCC for 8 years before McConnell recommended him.

So yes, Obama nominated him to become commissioner, but no, Obama did not put him in the FCC, because Ajit Pai was already in the FCC. See the distinction now?

Second, as I said in my edit, the FCC has to be 3/2 along party lines. it was a guaranteed Republican Party slot that had to be filled by a Republican. Given McConnell was the Republican Minority Leader at the time, of course he'd be allowed to weigh in on which Republican should be nominated for the Republican seat.

Also I like how you went from "I'm not blaming anyone for anything" to "This vote should rest at the feet of the guy who put Pai in the FCC and that was TOTALLY Obama!!!"

Weird how you're perfectly proving my point. 
$C: Democrats passed the net neutrality regulations that Republicans just repealed. 

Ignorance is not a position of virtue. 
$C: Don't know, not a lawyer. But I imagine that these companies exploit a loophole in the system where "donations" are not considered bribes.
$C: Are there any high-level prosecutors that aren't also corrupted? 
$C: Trump is just one republican. FCC dropped the ball, now it's Congress's turn to play. A NN bill will be more direct and relevant than Title II protections. Net neutrality is a bipartisan issue.
$C: The problem you're describing has nothing to do with net neutrality though. Poor selection in small towns/rural areas has always been a thing. 
$C: Hey u/spez

Fck off.
$C: That’s why you fight those organizations.


Change doesn’t come purely from the state level. The federal government has to see the unrest they are facing.

Oh wait, sorry those are **TRUMP SUPPORTERS** we're talking about here. We should alienate them and relegate them to unseen ghettos by actively creating new rules that apply only to them and creating a site-wide filter specifically against their subreddit.

It will never be imposed in a court of law because lawmakers would never pass a law that puts them in jail for life or executes them for taking money from corporation.

You can argue for it, but it will never happen
$C: Same here. I never thought I would say this, but it was actually better when we had time warner. Spectrum has found a way to be worse.
$C: Let me ask you then, how will the government effectively monitor all internet providers to make sure they are not shaping data? How will internet providers ensure that their own staff does not shape data on their own?

We have the same issues with the financial industry and compliance with CFPB regulations, which has caused many smaller banks to either merge, be acquired, or shut down because of the costs associated with the strict, ever changing regs that aren't even written down for reference. Look up the problems with UDAAP and you'll see why government regulation, even for the common good, can end up becoming death by unintended consequences.
$C: And that guy was an asshole.

They have rights once they have been created.  You should not create them if you cannot observe the rights that they *will* have once they are created.

Yes you can. By not fucking creating it. Just deal with the lives of people (and perhaps other sentient beings who can also suffer) who already exist.

>You will be breaking an unbroken line of mothers since the beginning of time.

Pick your logical fallacy: Argument from nature or from tradition?

>Your statement is such a slap in the face to everybody who has come before you, including your parents.

Well I didn't need to exist, nor any of their other descendants. They all decided to procreate knowing their children could end up not liking existence. It was a selfish decision. So fuck them, I have no problem giving them a metaphorical slap in the face. Plus it's not like it can bother my ancestors who are now dead.

I don't owe them anything.

>You also seem to think being alive is unnecessary suffering, the cost of living is too high to bring a new person into the world, so why don't you kill yourself if life is so horrible?

Because once you already exist, you're addicted to shit while trying to avoid pain. You can't really decide to stop caring about your own suffering.
There's a thing called evolution and it includes something called natural selection. Survival instincts are a thing, because of this. It's not like easy methods for suicide were always available. On top of that, empathy and love for people who would suffer from my death is not out of the equation. I'll gladly keep existing if I can prevent more suffering than how much I cause.
$C: Shoot, and I'm usually good at spotting them lol. They tend to all speak in the same way. Apologies
$C: You think only Republicans buy guns? Hell, I've never even registered to vote so I'm neither. But I've got a few guns lying around the house.
$C: Which is why democrats should distance themselves from gun control. Democrats are alienating a lot of people by supporting gun control. I'm left leaning, but I'll never vote for someone who wants to limit my right to own a gun or limit in anyway while criminals can get their hands on whatever they want. 

Edit: I fixed the false part of my statement. I know this is a controversial subject for a lot of people that lean left. I merely felt the need to share how I feel about this issue. 
$C: I'm confused why republicans don't like net neutrality. If anything, don't they appreciate limited government interference?

This seems like something that both parties could agree on, but I guess not. 
$C: That means nothing. You're putting assumptions into statistics. Here's your logic:

A: Only republicans own guns (false)

B: All republicans want to abolish net neutrality (false)

$C: You'd have to ask /u/azerbajani that.  But if I had to venture a guess, I'd point out that 'turfing the government out' is pretty hard considering how badly gerrymandered things are, not to mention how hard the incumbents (*Republicans*) have worked to disenfranchise people who aren't traditionally republican voters.  There is a strong perception among the Americans I speak to, perhaps not entirely unwarrantedly so, that the system has been corrupted past the point of no return.
$C: Didn't it say something about unemployment before it was deleted? I am employed. I just don't make a lot of money. So get an education to get a better job right? I'm saving money to go back while paying off the debt from going before. But I shouldn't have gone before and gotten into debt. Too bad 17 year old me listened to all off the adults saying sign this, you can pay it off when you get a job relevant to your major. I should have picked a better major huh? So I should just go get a better paying job to afford a better education.

$C: I'm not denying you, but any proof of anyone that was arrested for calling someone a "Tranny"?
$C: I think, technically, you are not correct. Let's say a police officer accuses you of breaking a law. The police officer who is representitive of the executive branch of the local government has certain rights that allow him to take you to jail and process you in. However, all 50 states in the US have laws that say a person who has been processed into the local jail must be arriagned within, I think, 48 hours (don't quote me on this, I'm not an expert). The officer who arrested you must appear at your arraignment to explain to the official (sometimes a judge) what crime that he has evidence that you committed. Then the judge or official can set your bail or deny it. The officer and the judge and all the people who process you into jail are representitives of the government. But, if you are accussed of a crime, it is effectively you against the police officer. If the police officer fails to show up during the arraignment or when your case goes to trial, the judge will dismiss the case. No other government official can stand in for the police officer. 
$C: It wasn’t funny though

$C: You need to chill out a bit.  You run the risk of living your life as a very angry person.  I wasnt suggesting that she become an illegal.  I was highlighting the fact that travel is not "impossible" if you are disadvantaged.  

Though, now that you mention it, if the alternative is killing ones self... I would argue that fucking off and at least trying to find happiness as an illegal would be a better option. 
$C: I'd prefer this scenario than have the US taxpayer be held hostage by insurance companies. We should not be subsidizing the insurance industry, especially not for the high-deductible plans that most of us are now being forced into.

$C: Well if you think the internet was fine from its founding up to 2015, then you have nothing to worry about. Which it was.
$C: Oh OK
$C: How so? Best case scenario the ISPs won't do anything to their services as they were before net neutrality was appealed, which wouldn't make sense at all. Getting rid of net neutrality allows ISPs to block or throttle the content they want to, which gives them the opportunity to block or throttle websites they disagree with or wish to make money from charging the website or consumer for full speeds. There was no reason to repeal net neutrality.
$C: Are you even serious? They will put in the work if it means more money

$C: Ah, you're one of those geniuses who likes to get less for their money and trusts in the goodness and righteousness of the american corporation. They've never taken advantage of consumers, and never will!
$C: Literally shilling as hard as they can so that the big corporations such as Netflix and Reddit (Conde Nast) won’t have to pay more for using up all the ISPs bandwidth. 
$C: Lol. “Damnit, I only have two terabytes of hentai, must download more!”
$C: I'm sorry that this whole thing is a joke to you but what do you expect us to do? My waifu is in there and she might get deleted forever. I have to get her out or Trump might take her away forever. It seems like you don't have a waifu yourself so you haven't discovered what true love is yet. True love is buying TBH hard drives and heading back to his mom's basement while running red lights and stop signs to save his waifu. I will do everything to keep her safe even if there is a 1% chance of my waifu being gone. One day you will find your waifu and you'll understand what I'm telling you right now.
$C: No, repealing Net Neutrality will mean more freedom for ISPs to calculate prices more effectively, by perhaps charging prices in proportion to bandwidth, and offer products consumers may like better.

Also all government regulations is wasteful at best, but I won't go down into that here. Here is a [primer](https://mises.org/library/primer-regulation).

$C: You can (and should) support the EFF, and wanting stronger privacy options is great, but it has *nothing* to do with net neutrality.  No one is advocating against your cause, you're just... wrong about what it's called.
$C: As I said Net Neutrality is but a piece of Internet Freedom. It is perfectly fine to talk about "keeping the net free" if someone is talking about removing Net Neutrality because doing so would make the internet less free.

It however doesn't make sense to group "Privacy" and "Marketing of Metadata" under Net Neutrality because they aren't directly related. They just roll up under together under "Internet Freedom".
$C: Having some marketing company track users on a private website doesn't affect a free and open internet in any way.
$C: No, user security and use of data is a privacy thing, this is about being able to access the internet in the first place. If you're genuinely that concerned about marketing and data selling then don't use the internet. Ever. No website will ever, unless you explicitly ask them to, withhold your browsing data from people who want to buy it.

You have more to worry about than some google employee knowing you whack it to midget bdsm. If you think not, welcome to the internet!
$C: Comparing apples to oranges. Google is not an ISP, I don't get how you don't understand this. Or maybe you do but chose to ignore it. If Google 'deranks' a website, your access to it doesn't change. You can still type in a URL to the site and directly access it, despite whatever propietary ranking Google does. 
$C: Net neutrality verbiage pertains only to ISPs, so all of this is moot. You still had access to those sites and pieces, just not on reddit.

You do see the nuance right? Reddit can stop you from seeing it on reddit. Your ISP can stop you from seeing it at all. Reddit doesn't control your internet.

Obama then enshrined the Internet as a Title 2 to protect Net Neutrality.

But yea, let's somehow try to blame this on Obama.

$C: > The references are to his 2012 bid and his 2013 inaug. You didn't even look at the links.

So then your arguments are even more baseless, because Obama's FCC protected Net Neutrality. So your argument is they attempted to buy Democrats... and failed because the Democrats protected us anyway.
$C: > Right, democrats only think of people.

[According to the votes](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2pwhvt/the_differences_between_the_democratic_party_and/), yes, they do. Obviously not all of them, but if you were to label one party as "the people's party" it would be the Democrats. Unions, for example, are a liberal thing.

>hey would never, say, take advantage of a certain section of the population that votes for them 90% and ignore them, exploiting their minority status and relative poverty via workfare programs for votes?

I'm black. I vote for Democrats not only because they see me as a human and recognize the importance of racial equality for all Americans, but also because they aren't full of white supremacists and literal actual nazis like the Republican party. The same Republicans who used to be Dixiecrats in the 60s, and were courted by Nixon's "southern strategy". 

But not only that, I also vote for them because Democrats understand economics and Republicans do not. Whenever Democrats are in office the economy is doing much better. Compare the Clinton era to the Bush era. Republicans do not understand economics. All they understand are tax cuts for the rich.

Democrats also care about infastructure, transportation, renewable energy, the environment, the internet, education, common sense healthcare, and so on.

>You aren't 'better', and democrats often help republican donors achieve their plans through brazen dumbness. 

[False](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2pwhvt/the_differences_between_the_democratic_party_and/). You sound like one of those "BERN IT DOOOWN" false equivalency idiots who is directly responsible for the rise of Trump.

$C: I also like the fact that your only upset at the hillary thing.  I was proving a point. Lieing about being fearful for your life is childish.

The whole point of the post was that the repeal of net neutrality has nothing to do with either party and has everything to do with corrupt companies and too much government control...but hey, I guess it went way over your head.  SRY
$C: Hilary is in fact not violently against who you identify sexually, but she is certainly pro-war and for invasion of the middle-east and the destruction of Iran and its population. That's why you americans were fucked from the go. Your choices were between Hilary or Trump, aka 2 dangerous clowns who could destroy the World. But lets being angry about your sexuality or because you consider yourself a bi-pan transexual homosexual. You americans are slaves, you are slaves of your system. You don't even know what a democracy is anymore, since you think you can only have 2 choices. Hey lady, there was at least 30 others candidates that could have done a better job than the decadent hilary or the degenerate Trump. Problem is, whoever has the money has the power and the media to back it up. Your country is a fucking shitshow and I hope your civilization end very soon. 
$C: Oh neat!  There's tens of us backing you here on Reddit!

$C: Well, here goes. Yeah republicans, I hate every one of you! **Every. Single. One.** of you wanted this!  

You see what I'm getting at? You're demonizing millions who didn't want this done. I didn't go republican to go against NN, rather for other political issues. Blame it on us, sure, however don't forget there are many republicans who do not like this decision.
$C: Ah, so i guess since they "blocked piracy traffic" they magically found a way to differentiate between 100% legal traffic and piracy?


No? They just blocked it all?



Comcast's exact reason was because P2P was using up too much traffic on their network, rather than spending their constantly growing profit margins they decided to fuck over the consumer (Notice a similarity?)



$C: > How the hell did I go off the deep end

I dont understand how can you defend this,  it is nothing positive for consumer,  even if perfect world ISPs not abuse this, the chance always lingers there.

I live in country which always had NN, i pay 29 euro/month for 100mbs internet access, with  that speed to any website/service i want. All internet except mobile are unlimited data here.  With 10 euro i would get 10mbs which is enough for any use.  4g mobile internet costs 10euro here with suffcient monthly data

I dont see how destroying NN that protrcts companies and customers would help me

I specificed
>Can someone tell me ONE legitimate reason they think this is the case?

in my original post and literally requested a reason for it. And then when the guy who actually did give an attempt of a reason I responded to it. I can be sure of my position because I know what you lose when you get rid of this act and [what you are giving ISP's the ability to do](https://wccftech.com/net-neutrality-abuses-timeline/) and there are very little pro arguments for Net Neutrality that [I haven't seen already been addressed](https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/19/these-are-the-arguments-against-net-neutrality-and-why-theyre-wrong/) in some sort.

The opposing arguments are so ridiculous that to get to any valid points you have to go through a bunch of non logical reasoning and a bunch of morons using hyperbole to make people defending Net Neutrality seem crazy (such as "You better do it quick tho, before Ajit Pai starts charging you 5 bux per search."


And I never claimed that there weren't any arguments for it, I literally asked for them.

You are trying to tell me that I have such a sure position without considering the opposing argument in response to a post where I ask for opposing arguments.

$C: Nah. In  my case, YouTube Red is literally paying to get rid of the spinning arrow.

The difference is *who* I might pay for getting rid of nuisance throttles. And at least where I live there is more competition among ISPs than there is for the big social media sites.

No. Am I mad? Yes just like millions of other people who have said way worse things than me and they probably mean what they're are saying. So why don't you "report" the FBI on them? But i'm done with this because it's clear you're just a troll. You will soon have to pay extra money to troll people online and you should be pissed.

Urbanization does lead to increased wealth. Too bad our constitution was written with the express intent of giving rural communities an equal voice in government knowing their population is lower than Urban Centers.
$C: That's not proof. These were allegations. I'm not saying that allegations shouldn't be brought forward, but you and the media are actively calling this man a pedophile without solid proof. That's the problem. You cannot condemn a man without a trial. 
$C: It's a joke. I'm not retarded. 
$C: Mate, stop. You're making the left look bad, don't insult people because of where they are from. If they say something stupid, go after that. 
$C: I'm not even sure what you're talking about at this point. A few questions, if you'll entertain me...

1. What money am I raking in?
2. How much?
3. How can I get access to said money?
4. What weird part of the internet do you read?
5. Did you know that William Clinton sexually assaults women and you can find more information on that subject at informationbattles.org?
6. Who hurt you?
7. Are you aware of the fact that I am person, and am not, in fact, a Southern state?
$C: How is any of that the case? You said “they take more than they give” which is a completely false statement.

“Proved me wrong with factual information”

But considering you last comment...

NN rage is because  now the ISP which in many cases have monopoly,  can blackmail the customers and the companies. They can choose which companies  are successful and which not. Small company? Well if you are not willing to pay whatever sum  ISP made up, you wont have any customers. ISP can block you or  alow the access to you so slow that nobody ever uses your service or website.

ISP can start charging  websute packages. Want to use something else than 1 news website and facebook?   Hey just buy our premium user package only 100$/month.

The decision is only negative for consumers and the IT business.

If you give companies chance to be assholes, they will be becayse they live to make money. No matter how they promise they wont abuse the system

$C: I know mate, I've not at any point been misled about your point of view on this.
$C: >The subreddit that has been calling for Ajit Pai's beheading

Where?  How many article are posted on /r/politics that call for violence against anyone?  TD routinely allows topics calling for civil war and other types of aggression.

Anyway, my point is that information is you can't complain about some idea that you have about /u/spez when your own mods are doing something much much worse...and you don't have to take my word for it, just make a new account and post an article on Lane Davis.  See how quickly you and the topic last.

Keep well.
$C: You and i both know that in your screenshot "cheese pizza" is in reference to child pornography, you intentionally obtuse fuck.
$C: I never said anything about censoring anyone. I'm just pointing out that him framing spez editing shitposty comments as some deep violation of his human rights is ridiculous. You guys hit spez, and spez hit back. For people that pride themselves on reals over feels, you sure do get upset when someone flips the script on you. 
$C: Then please explain how NN could possibly mean censorship in any logical sense.
$C: In like one day. That's what I was referring to.
$C: >He said that that's not what nn means

No, he said I was "completely wrong"

>what you wrote had anything to do with nn.


Oh, honey
$C: How is saying "That's not what NN means" a response to legitimate criticism? It's a fucking copout.
$C: I still don't see any. Let me try posting a fact so you can see what one looks like.

Fact: /u/PopeADopePope doesn't understand what net neutrality is.
$C: >So what have you done?

I've made my calls, written my emails, spread the word and the discussion, and most importantly, I have voted.  That's what I can do, and for the vast majority of Americans, all any of us can.

>I came up with a solution for people like me... And I know there are flaws. But I didn't come here as a genius. I came here to offer some insight and say what im doing to fight it.

There's a difference between coming up with a solution you think will work for everyone based off an emotional response, and working together with people to determine an effective strategy to fight based off of logic and reason.  Your passion is admirable, but this isn't the time for emotion.  Pai has already claimed he will ignore any entreatments he deems emotional (not that he's going to give a damn about any entreatments at all).  This is the time to sit, think, discuss, and strategize a solution that is feasible for the majority of Americans.  Like I said before, the internet is now a utility for us; this means that we can no more function without it than we can electricity or running water.  Just "not paying for it" isn't a strategy that can work, and focusing time and effort on something that will INEXORABLY fail is a waste.  I can guarantee you this will be the case for more people than you realize.

>But it feels like you came here to tell me specifically that my type of protest won't work because it doesn't work for you.

This isn't the case, I promise.  I came to tell you that this line of thinking isn't only futile, but it wastes what potential and intellect you could be devoting to solutions that are actually feasible.  You don't have to lead a charge.  The charge has been going for a while now.  Lend your talents elsewhere because they're needed.  And as I mentioned before, it isn't because it doesn't work for me.  It wouldn't work for a single human being I know.

>That's super counter productive and probably exactly the attitude that lead us to this apathy.

Not once did I say do nothing.  Granted, I didn't offer a counter-idea, so I can see where you'd assume this.

I want to tell you something else.  Nothing is over here.  This isn't the death of Net Neutrality, not yet.  Congress can still vote to do away with what the FCC have done.  That's why it's so vital you contact your congresspeople as incessantly as you can, like a lot of us are and have been.  If you've been doing that, awesome.  Keep going because it isn't over.  If you haven't started, it's not too late.

If you don't have faith in Congress (understandable), know that if Congress does nothing, there WILL be some majorly nasty litigation being issued here, by people who have the money and clout to actively pursue this.  Don't be so fatalistic, because there's still plenty of fighting to be done.  The FCC has gone against the will of about 80% of the American people.  That doesn't usually end well.

$C: there won't be one  the ISPS could block all websites under a pay wall now if they wanted too yet they refuse but ofc they will rush to do is in a more open market with more competition makes sense 
$C: Awww that cute you wittle little triggered cuck snowflake who supports pedos and rapists.
$C: Oh yes. 

>there is nothing leftists hate more than knowledge

Facts.
$C: Because it's anecdotal on top of being a minority opinion.  What it sounds like you're say is "*I've* never had a problem with their service, so I don't understand why other people complain about it, or their overall business practices." which doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

It's pretty widely documented how shitty the big three internet providers are about running their businesses.
$C: If your philosophy is all about winning and you backed a candidate that cant even get out of his own way and has shit himself to an embarrassing approval rating, thats some top level lol.  "Butthurt asswipe"  Your room temperature iq just oozes r/donald level retardation.  Good try.  I'm glad my verbal dismantling of your half baked posts had you so triggered you had to come back and reply to one days later in a vain attempt to feel some sense of "winning"  Get back to making shitty threads no one gives a fuck about and take the L cleetus.
$C: Jesus Christ.... Yea the government putting a law in place that keeps the Internet completely unregulated is censoring the internet... Are you even trying to make sense?
$C: Not OP but: NN keeps the internet a neutral space, meaning that ISP's do not have a say in which content is reachable and which isn't. Given, there is a lot of manipulation on today's internet, and that's really bad for our society, but by revoking NN we open up the internet for a new kind of manipulation: Powerful groups can pay ISP's to suppress content they don't like. Instead (or more likely in addition) to having to manipulate sites like reddit, facebook et al, they can now simply make it extremely difficult for people to reach the content they don't want you to see. 

There's also an economic argument to make. Netflix could pay ISP's to throttle access to all streaming sites but themselves. The company with the bigger purse gets the deal, and new, small possible disruptors of the market get driven out, reducing competition in the process.

What are the practical arguments for the repeal?
$C: Can you explain what is bad about net neutrality? I don't think you're able to.
$C: That the internet is completely open and not manipulated by anyone, especially private corporations. The technology of the internet was created and funded with tax payer dollars so we the citizens have the natural born right to access this technology completely and freely. A founding principle of the internet is to give open access of the internet to everyone. 

There is literally no defense to repealing net neutrality and at this point its fucking mind boggling there are people that defend it's repeal. They are either completely uneducated on the topic or they are in it for the monetary gains that services providers will receive with the repeal. 
$C: Asking a question in response to a question so you can cover up that you know nothing about what you're arguing for. Hilarious. 
$C: Better monopolize water and electricity too then. Since the internet has become just as much a utility as anything else.

What taxes are we paying to "give" internet to people who can't afford it? Please enlighten me.

The billions that your heroes, the ISPs took to "improve" the internet infrastructure? The same billions they did nothing with?

Cool.
$C: >I shouldn't have to subsidize your access to it just because you can't afford it.

You don't understand this topic. You wouldn't have to subside anything. Data and infrastructure is dirt cheap to provide, relative to the fees the ISPs charge, with or without net neutrality protections. That's why an increasing number of companies and municipalities are able to easily provide inexpensive 1000MBps/1000Mbps internet without caps or any net neutrality violating shenanigans.

In your ignorance, you've been duped into arguing against your own best interests. It seems like every anti-net-neutrality proponent I've come across has been similarly duped. I'm still waiting for a decent argument from them...
$C: ok, so.... in the last 10 years, what's the longest you've gone without using the internet?  Or, more easily, are you prepared to be cut off from it tomorrow?  forever?

I guess more importantly, how are tax dollars paying for internet?
$C: They aren't doing business with ISP's because ISP's don't own the internet. They are just a means of accessing it
$C: Sure they have every republican is a Russian  puppet sure buddy the thing is this doesn't effect the stability of the USA at all Russia has no reason at all to help this law pass  they aren't the evil monster wanting nothing but the destruction  of the USA you put them out to be good relations with the USA would benefit both nations greatly China is also our competitor why isn't anybody blaming them if Trump and the Republican party was nothing but Russian puppets the USA would have been destroyed 1 month after Trump came into office NATO  disbanded  all support for Ukraine cut Russia doesn't give 2 fucks if you pay 4$ more for your fucking internet  ( btw makes 0 sense how one of the richest and now  the most powerful man on earth would listen to Putin if anything it would be the opposite Putin the one listening to Trump )
$C: Yeah you do that's fine, just stop being a disgusting racist xeonophobe about it ffs, just because barry couldn't secure the country from cyber attack, you're going crazy with these muh Russia delusions.
$C: you shouldn't be discriminatory towards people of disability, shame on you for mocking them.
$C: Must be your bed time.
$C: [deleted]
$C: No it didn't. The problem doesn't "end" when a company or service releases a scripted apology or temporary stops, and not all of them even had the decency to do that. It ends when they're no longer allowed to censor your internet or throttle your content, retard. As long as it is legal it will keep happening.
$C: AOL has absolutely nothing to do with net neutrality. There was no net neutrality legislation during AOL's time.
$C: [deleted]
$C: And yet OP was stating it like it was a fucking fact, good job showing you have 0 idea how anything works in the real world.

What an embarrassingly sad statement on your life.

$C: Can't tell if this is satire...
$C: You ever think this one through? Because this is hilarious.
$C: 15 years and two administrations ago? Same agency but not the same people, so not the same behaviors. Good try tho Vlad. 
$C: Once again - that was a Republican admin, and they knowingly lied.

Nice try, but that was 2 steps backward

$C: Nothing but charges, subpeonas and an admittance from Trump Jr but yeah nothing to see here. Its taken a year to carry out a complicated and thorough investigation but I guess these things are normally solved Chief Wiggun style "DIDYA DOIT?"..."Does that ever work?"..."Well, no, not really but uh...DIDYOU DOIT?!" 
$C: Nothing eh? I guess all these charges are imaginary
$C: > About one year

Is an [incredibly short time](https://i.imgur.com/kRiveU9.png) for one of these investigations.  Also it's only been about 7 months.
$C: **That’s not the point.** People wanted a source, this user provided it. Don’t get your upset at the individual supplying the source for it’s quality. That’s ridiculous.
$C: 400,000 hahahaha dude that place is bot farm central 
$C: With all the bans in the_safespace i'm surprised there is not only one guy posting on dozens of alts agreeing with himself while furiously masturbating.
$C: This isn't higher wages... This is a labor shortage in a single sector (well probably more than one realistically) that is driving up costs passed on to you directly. This isn't a company paying their employees more out of the good of their hearts, or something that is anything but temporary until more people are found.

It's no more a wage increase than gas prices going up during peak travel dates is a sign of higher oil prices.
$C: It's very interesting how you can believe anything that you like without any evidence. What's it like living in a fantasy?
$C: So you got called out for lying and you try to deflect with even more lies? Shocking
$C: I'm not the one you originally replied to, so I don't know about your argument. I was just pointing out how hilariously wrong it is to say your party doesn't want kids raped. Guess who else is a rapist? The president! 
$C: How exactly does a shortage in *legal* visa immigration in MAINE, of all places, have to do with deportation of mexicans?

And your article doesn't specify nationality. Those foreigners could be European or Canadian for all we know. Maine has less than 1% Mexican population and I don't think Donald is cracking down on Hoosiers. 
$C: If that were true (which it isn't), then why would trump annul it?
$C: Yep.
$C: So whataboutism right, except do I or do I not have a point? And why can't we focus on more than one issue at a time? 

Edit: Again, I never said the left was as bad as the right. I admitted to whataboutism (though I wasn't trying to downplay the Russian interference) and explained why I felt I had a valid point, but you never answered my question. 
$C: > Democrats are the good guys!

-retards, probably.
$C: I saw, thank you for that.

But you need to give me some guidance here, because there isn't a single title in any video, comment or post that points to an explanation of hos someone bought the mods of /r/politics.

Which video will show that? Do you have a timestamp?
$C: So, still no proof. Ok, cool.
$C: They don't move the goalposts, you don't even get close to them
$C: I was being sarcastic.  r/politics suffers from extreme groupthink.  

Sometimes it's possible to play different elements of it against each other.  In 2016 there were a lot of anti-hillary/pro-bernie posts.  That was normal for the heat of a campaign.  After Sanders was mathematically eliminated there seemed to be another uptick.  That time though many of the links (organically upvoted) came from places like brietbart and rt.  It only worked because a sentiment was already relatively broadly held.  That trick would not have worked in 2008 with Clinton losing because her embittered supporters (PUMAs) weren't reddits user base.  

Forums change too.  Before 2008 /r/politics had a strong libertarian  streak.  After the "great recession", not so much.  
$C: Uranium One has been debunked. You're dumb for blaming Hillary and not the other 8 of 9 supporters for the sale. You're even more dumb for assuming it's criminal when the Trump / Sessions justice department won't even investigate or prosecute. That is concrete proof that they fed you bullshit they couldn't eat themselves but you gobbled it right up.

No one is shilling here either. We have idiots like you, who open their mouth wide while Sessions and Trump shit into their mouth, and people like me and the guy you're debating, who look for truth. 
$C: It's a valid link,  should be available in Russian

Oh yeah,  you guys have *the best* shilling.

$C: You are so brainwashed is not even funny
$C: [deleted]
$C: What? You guys talk like that for real? I thought it was satire. No wonder you are considered a joke  on every site. Even 4chan despise the_safespace
$C: Not entirely sure what you mean, but it is interesting when outside of r/politics, Trump supporters experience hardy any (if at all) downvotes. In fact, they remain upvoted. Just goes to show you how bad r/politics really is
$C: You can thank the Kenyan for your part time jobs, that was his big achievement. Removing everyone from full time jobs and getting them into 3 part time shit jobs. God Emperor Trump, Savior of Mankind and Destroyer of Cucks is reversing the Obama economy. Thank God.
$C: oh no how are we on the internet today I thought it was the end you faggot
$C: Shhh, let him have his little victory. They think saying "reeee" and calling you a cuck/faggot is some epic burn or something.

$C: Lol you're threatening to attempt to overthrow a democratically elected government because you didn't get your way. You're delusional

News to me

(why would I get downvoted for this? I dare you to find any indication of my supposed status as a "trump supporter")
$C: Oh yes all muh make-believe facts and evidence, surely will finally be le end of le Drumpf.

$C: Congratulations, kiddo. You're about to learn a real, hard lesson in hubris over the next few years.
$C: Vote. Stop being an armchair general who wants to “wipe out all of Washington”, you sound like an edgy 13 year old.
$C: found the antifa
$C: This debate is pointless because we're not going to agree. You're not *wrong* in that it's about competition, and I'm not unfounded in my fear of my ISP changing their platform for my service and me not having an alternative. 
$C: Lol so it's a bad thing because NN is correlated with the government. Good god you're hopeless...
$C: if you google search you will find it that's how I did it
$C: No, its called not being a partisan shill and believing everything reddit tells you. This site is corrupted and full of propaganda, the sooner you realize that the sooner all of that pent up rage you have goes away. 
$C: Stats also show that Republicans are wealthier, happier, more mentally stable.  Careful when you use statistics.  Because statistics aren't too kind to liberals.
$C: It also doesn't work without the myriad other components that make up the Internet. Are you guys going to start pushing for electric companies to decide what devices cost extra next?
$C: Comcast and Verizon? Yes I agree.

Facebook is a popular service. It's not a monopoly. It's a populist place, so it's probably not the place for fringe beliefs and controversy. If you weren't embraced there or on reddit that doesn't mean they have a monopoly.

Unfortunately private companies offer no freedom of speech. I honestly think that's too bad, but it is what is. Reddit stopped tolerating the more uncouth subreddits quite some time ago. People didn't like it, but they're within their rights as a private enterprise.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Well I don't know what subreddits you subscribe to, but most every subreddit that has ever been censored has violated site rules, or just broke US law. Pretty obvious that doxxing, harrasing, and brigading are not allowed on reddit, or most every part of the internet. And I'm not saying those are ones you subscribe to, but pretty much all subreddits that get banned are hate subreddits.

Also, defamation is not censorship, in fact, it's freedom of speech. Neither is changing passwords, but I don't know the example of which you're talking about. Pretty mundane censorship considering reddit could shadowban you and remove all your comments for having a 'bad' opinion.

Could you help me understand here, which subreddits you used were censored unfairly?
$C: Why are you doing this?
$C: I'm not reading your comment, *take it somewhere else.*
$C: See if you can get that excuse to work in a court of law.
$C: I love the Trump presidency, maybe you misunderstand me, it's going to end up great for Democrats. Never before have we had such an incompetent and corrupt government, that's true, but it is also bringing about a huge resurgence in Democratic activism and voting. It's no surprise we won a Senate seat in the reddest of states and we're easily going to take the House and maybe even the Senate in 2018. Meanwhile, yeah, some minor bills will pass that are easily reversed, and any executive order is just as easy to remove once this fun reality show is over. 

I dealt with the Bush administration for 8 years, I can make it through Trump, especially since the guy literally is so incompetent, he can't get anything done. As a bonus I get a fun reality show where we get huge victories at the polls every few months, cabinet members quitting and being fired, and Trump officials going to prison. I think it's a good trade-off. 

The only thing the tax bill does is remove the mandate, it doesn't touch the Obamacare, that would require a super-majority in this bill 

Let them build wall prototypes, they like their legos, but the real thing will never be built 

Net Neutrality will benefit huge corporations like google, facebook, etc, at the expense of smaller sites like 4chan which will be the first to feel throttling and of course any type of competition to major sites. Won't affect me really and will eventually be back on the table. 

The rest of the stuff is dumb executive orders that just get removed once the new guy comes in. It's not all bad, I enjoy it so far. 
$C: I said something along the lines of "Why don't you believe in global warming?"
$C: I'm not the one with the asinine argument.
$C: > Your point is that unless every single person in the executive branch isn't directly elected then we don't live in a democracy

No, my point is that not every aspect of our government is democratic. The FCC is not a democratic commission, no one voted for them on a ballot, contrary to your claim. You’ve gotten yourself so twisted up in your false logic you don’t even remember what your position is.
$C: And you have? There are plenty of summaries available, and Net Neutrality has been the norm for the entire life of the internet, so I'd say your claims are pretty unfounded.
$C: So now you're mad the FCC has influence and instead of taking out your anger on the ISPS you take your anger out on a man who did what he was assigned to do its like being mad at Trump for winning the election isn't of being mad at the DNC for losing it votes of his citizens huh don't see anybody calling for a referendum buddy a few morons calling in because they read an reddit post doesn't effect anything  this whole NN bullshit is pathetic and you're disgusting calling for the death of someone is wrong in general and you having 0 fucking clue about NN just adds to it  you hate the rich yet you support the ones that fit your agenda

Do you honestly think fucking *Comcast* has your best interest at heart?

Google and the like support it because their interests align with ours, not because they care oh so much. These are companies that make money through our use of the internet. If we have shit internet, it hurts their profits.
$C: I am infuriated. You should be as well. And you really think this will stop kids from looking at porn and going on social media? No it won’t. Thier parents will just pay the 12.99$ a month access cost for MyFaceGram premium pro unlimited. 
$C: Investment has increased 5% under Obama's net neutrality rules. INCREASED. Read the article. This information is out there and there's no reason for you not to know it.

His net neutrality rules reflected a 2005 FCC policy statement that said that no provider should discriminate re: content. That has been the FCC policy from 2005 to now. All of a sudden, it needs to be rolled back.
$C: Lol the people arguing with you are the same people who don't understand why google fiber just kind of fizzled out
$C: When your modem bank in your basement becomes competition then we'll see if your tune changes.

I could boycott the big companies which in a sense I already do(work reasons). 
Question real fast: I’m paying money for a service, they decide to change policy and don something I don’t like. How does that make me entitled? 
$C: [deleted]
$C: republicans claim to be anti government while getting tons of money from lobbyists. For them as individuals, government is great.
2nd, your logic is flawed: I'm a huge corporation bribing the government and also running propaganda bringing awareness to what I'm doing, using my money to turn voters against me... lol what?
$C: I'm talking about a household internet, not a cell provider. Comcast is the only ISP of that sort. Cell service is not a viable alternative. 
$C: It's just funny how this was NEVER a partisan issue until trump got elected. Both the left and the right agreed that NN was necessary and important. Now that we have the right who will literally eat shit just so a liberal eillb have to smell their breathe it's a partisan issue lol now that the right will go against anything the left supports even if it's in their best interest as well. We've had some form of NN for over a decade. Why change now? Why give the ISP's that power? They spent hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying against NN. They're going to want a return on their investment and that will be coming from our pockets. Use your head. Don't just watch right wing shit.
$C: So apparently you're not aware of how the FCC works.

By statute, the FCC is required to have 2 Republicans and 2 Democrats, and the president gets full control over who to choose as chair. Because of this, whenever a Republican retires when a Democrat is in charge, the Senate chooses who gets to replace the Republican. Ajit Pai was chosen by Mitch McConnell.

Yes, Obama "appointed" Pai, because he is the only one with the power to appoint executive positions. But he was required by statute to appoint the person the Republicans chose.

So, now that you're aware of how it works, please don't spread this oversimplification that misinforms people anymore.

$C: 99% of Republicans in office are for the repeal.

I wonder why Republican voters keep voting for Republican politicians. 

Oh well, guess it really wasn't *that* important to them!
$C: My father is a heavy republican and even he saw through Ajit's bullshit. He called it "Unfair and completely uncalled for"

|Yeah you have less blacks and Mexicans than the US and more white people are you surprised to be doing better, though look at your negros and how inferior they are within one generation.

We have a lot of immigrants in Sweden, it's generally not an issue. And all research points to it having nothing to do with race/ethnicity and more to the fact that they've been through war and had to flee their homes. You don't think that would affect you? A few generations and there's no differance, they're as Swedish as me.

|Mhm I do always love your deflection when a little girl is torn inhalf by some subhuman African you imported by saying well hey were happy

We are happy, as a people. But that might just be because we're not such fucking cowards that you are. You're so fucking scared of people hurting you that I can't even relate to it.
Well, I'm not scared. Neither are most of my countrymen. We will keep trying to make the world a better place and try to minimize the damage that you keep on doing.
$C: Yep, very true man. 
$C: Typical, people just want to pretend that their bubble is perfect and don’t want to hear someone else tell them otherwise. 
$C: I'm not spreading anything. I don't know much about the issue. I'm merely concluding due to the apocalyptic nature of the "discussion" that NN must have solved some major issue when it was implemented. So what was that issue?
$C: [deleted]
$C: How is the government stopping time Warner for fucking you?

Not having NN is going to allow Verizon/Comcast to start royally fucking people over simply because they can. They say they won't, but you are kidding yourself if you think they won't find a "reason" to go back on their previous statements. 
$C: Just watched the video, that was definitely the worst. Also that laugh cut scene at the end, trying to be funny/quirky. Ugh. This is where American tax payer money is going to?
$C: The companies who built on horseshoeing probably did as well it's called adaptation.

They built on a private platform and it moved I'd advise them not to build on a private entity and expect it in perpetuity.

If someone wants to pay extra for unlimited 4k streaming they can arstechbica went into this 92% of the country has at least two isp choices and 86 have three the whining is over speed and you aren't entitled to fast speeds their nice but not a entitlement.

Porn negatively affects society and far too much of the net is wasted by it. Overly sexualization of people damages them and mucks up people also please don't pretend just because Timmy can't get 4k hell start raping 

If a person will be a thief on account of internet they were already a thief.

No it'll lead to just more linemen fixing things when a net addicted kid smashes lines because he thinks he's entitled to fast speeds.

Think about it your complaint is you may have to pay a fair rate for all you use you dropped the argument of access at all to go for access and high speeds will they also be expected to pay your entertainment bill?

Companies will pay the rate it's similar to taxes shift them around and even after all the whining you'll be surprised that most people turn out their wallets.

It professionals can afford it or their companies can afford it.

$C: What niche topics are you interested in learning about, which you suspect a privately owned, profit driven ISP would have an incentive to prevent you from seeing?
$C: You are kinda out of touch. This is a big deal cause the only ISPs in most places are Comcast. Time warner or Verizon. Maybe at&t. This idea of yours won’t work 
$C: Fiber is not a viable business model. Google has all but stopped expanding their fiber network, as have other companies.

His mind won’t be changed by all the reason in the world. When both sides of the political spectrum are against you, maybe you should reconsider your policy. 
$C: Good thing I don't go around being a piece of shit then cause I agree with you.
$C: Well it might stop people from being rude to retail workers, which I have to say I'm in favor of. 
$C: Not in this case since without a repeal no legislation would be introduced as it hasn’t even with a democratic majority since the framework of net neutrality was first put in place in 2014
$C: They both seem pretty fucked up to me. In the current era, albeit, Republicans take more actions that hurt the majority of the people in the country. They, however, view that hurt as strengthening the country...which is usually absurd but sometimes is accurate, e.g. the debt being a thing which we need to stop the growth of lest we burden the future too greatly. Anyway, I'll grant you that in general Republicans take actions which are less progressive and less populist than Democrats IMO. Objectively worse? Not all of them.
$C: That's nice, I'm an unaffiliated voter. There are some good politicians out there, but you keep doing you and painting with that broad brush.

That's still a lie at the moment, and I don't like people insinuating it (much less blatantly saying it). Until the GOP tries to cancel elections and go full Handmaid's Tale, at least, we are still a democracy.
$C: **Wireless mesh network**

A wireless mesh network (WMN) is a communications network made up of radio nodes organized in a mesh topology. It is also a form of wireless ad hoc network.

A mesh refers to rich interconnection among devices or nodes. Wireless mesh networks often consist of mesh clients, mesh routers and gateways.

$C: Nice. 
$C: Protest in front of the ISP's corporate headquarters, maybe?

Or... we could form a non-governmental regulatory agency that deals strictly with internet issues and telling the ISPs to knock it off when they're doing something wrong. Because for an individual, it's a pain in the butt to deal with the ISPs when there's a problem.

I don't think any of us have tried speaking to the head of Comcast or anything, but an in-person chat could mean a lot. We could hold a non-governmental election and have someone do that for us. See the results we get, and adjust our strategy from there.

Does that sound better than letters to Congress?
$C: Honestly, probably not.
$C: active in this community: r/sugardaddydatingsites
get off your high horse, m8. 
$C: Well if you want to cause chaos and violence then go right ahead. No one except law enforcement is going to stop you.

But I will make sure not to go that route thank you very much.
$C: The reason we can't have civil political discourse is that your side literally doesn't believe that things actually have truth value.

You talked about how people who are pro net neutrality are amazingly uninformed and called me myself uniformed when I cited the fact that the opposite is true. I cited a bad thing caused by lack of regulation.

You then proceeded to stan for it hardcore by a combination of marketing talk as empty as "innovation is being stifled and new jobs are not being created by big government" and literal outright lying.

At least 80% Americans are pro net neutrality. Almost every original comment to the FCC (99.9???9) is pro-NN, while anti-NN comments are faked via illegal identity theft. And yet, every single Republican is against NN. Every single. 

You make it a partisan issue and you choose to lie.
$C: Wow, that sounds very neutral. And we're on the internet. Almost like a neutral network. A net neutrality, if you will.
$C: We can go back to that as soon as you stop supporting a shit monger racist sexist asshole president.
$C: right but that doesnt mean they can sue people for having them tell other people they offered them a proposition

it's completely ridiculous... especially if there's no written NDA
$C: The reality is that everyone does not NEED an ISP. Its a sad world we live in because everyone fully and truely believes that we cant survive without internet or modern tech.

The truth is yes, we all can. Is is harder? Hell yes, but it is absolutely doable. People with a lot less knowledge survived for a much longer time without it than we have even had access to modern technology. The world is just fucking lazy, end of story. It also just happens to work out great for the elite to 'capitalize' upon the fact that oir society has been bred to believe convenience is all that matters.

If ISPs in areas where only one ISP offers internet start charging a higher rate to access some websites that people can't afford or aren't willing to pay, or if those ISPs straight up block websites they don't like, then those websites may as well not exist for those people.

That's pretty dystopian...

"Did you see that article about _____ yesterday? Haha no I didn't because Comcast decided it wasn't worth reading for me."

Get ready for digital unpersoning.
$C: Idk if you're joking but the VPN may be free from the proprietor but your isp can now charge your use of a VPN is what he was getting at.
$C: $1,800 a month is hyperbole, but their ability to do that if they decided to even right this second is very real.
$C: An ISP is not a natural monopoly.
$C: Not for another 2.5 years they can't.  This vote was nothing short of a farce - Just like the tax "reform" corporate "America" (even if they're based out of Ireland for tax purposes) is about to get.
$C: > So you must believe the internet was created in 2015.

Yes. That is the only conclusion.
$C: > There were no heavy net-neutrality FCC guidelines about two years ago and prior.

It is absolutely incorrect to suggest that we did not have NN before 2015. You can read about it on the wiki, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality. NN comes out of the idea of a common carrier, which vastly predates the internet.
$C: Ah, classic. The strawman followed by the straw-ier man. People who "fight for guns" don't want less government. They just want the government to tell us something different. In the end, it's not about big vs. small. It's about what we want to force society to be like using our own power, whether that's done on the micro or macro scale.
$C: The V.C had nowhere the military prowess the U.S had. You also assume that the military is entirely subservient to the "billionaire class." Along with the National Guards of every state including Texas who has, it's own nuclear arsenal.
$C: Except this isn't about the people, this is about the lawmakers.
$C: > Quit trying to make Republicans look bad

Perhaps they could stop electing people that make them look bad.

Regardless of their supposed feelings on the matter, the voters who elected the scumbags pushing this (or the scumbags who appointed these scumbags) are still responsible for the consequences of their votes.

You can't back Corrupty Mc.Puppyeater for president then act incensed when people suggest that you support corruption and puppyeating, because you *just supported it* at the booths. It's all hollow words in the face of damning actions.

Left leaning subs will downvote you, but none of the major ones ban people for differring opinions. TD however is a propoganda chamber. They even refuse to admit that Trump said in the election that he supports net neutrality. If reality is anti Trump then that isn't our problem.

I was offering an explanation of why that person was being heavily downvoted. That's it. Take your own advice re: reading comprehension skills 

$C: I'm sure they're different in each city, but one of the more important examples is probably what happened in [Nashville with Google](https://gizmodo.com/what-happened-to-google-fiber-1792440779). What happens is there are all sorts of rules related to attaching wires to telephone polls that heavily favor existing companies. Google gets bogged down in red tape and lawsuits, and what happens is they effectively can't actually install any fiber.

$C: I think you might be confused. I'm against NN. I'm making fun of the person who was complaining about the fact that the FCC has so much control over people's lives, but presumably is *for* NN. I took your response to be an argument against that notion. When you displayed confusion about my response to you, I clarified with "If you're defending OP's comment..." Clear enough?
$C: I don't want to sound like a dick, but you do realize that these guys are being bought by the major corporations that want this killed.  It's not a matter of what they should and shouldn't agree on.  Money talks louder than words.

$C: Imagine an alien dropping from the sky and claims you’re the new President of Mars.

Do you recall any of that hypothetical nonsense happening prior to 2015?

This isn’t fucking China.
$C: That is such horseshit. It's a big deal on the internet because you guys have made it a big deal. If not for your weird phobia about markets and your desire to control people, you would be up in arms anytime there's an instance of an ISP trying to enter the market but being stopped by regulation, or anytime a politician pushes for more regulatory capture by existing ISPs that increase their stranglehold on the market. Nobody makes a fucking peep about that. How odd.

Just fucking own up to what your biases are.
$C: >Setting up independent networks locally has an immense initial cost. And then, what? Big ISPs can just offer cheaper internet in that area, undercutting the prices of smaller independent ISPs that may pop up. So small ISPs can't compete and fail. In return the big ISPs can now just jack up the price for, whatever. Whatsapp data usage or something, all over the country, to make up for the cost of undercutting the new ISPs. After all, they can provide internet everywhere, and smaller ISPs can not. This is also why smaller coffee shops will not exist anywhere near Starbucks. It is not viable, Starbucks can afford undercutting prices to cause another business to go out of business.

No, the reason smaller coffee shops don't exist near starbucks (which is not really true, but ok) is because starbucks offers a huge variety of good tasting coffee, with the speed and efficiency of a large company. Predatory pricing is a boogeyman that basically never exists, because it doesn't make sense. So comcast sees that there is competition in one of their areas. They then drop their prices for some undetermined amount of time and hopes the other company goes out of business. They're losing money while doing this. The point is that once there are no competitors, they can just jack up the prices to make up for all of that loss. The problem with your logic is that a) there actually IS some competition among ISPs, otherwise your internet bill would be some arbitrarily huge amount, which it isn't. and b) once their competition goes out of business and they jack the prices up, another company could crop up and take their business again, and then comcast would have to do the whole process over again. It makes no sense.

>Then there is the problem of how the internet operates. Big ISP has a ton of servers with all of the internet on it. They can just block smaller ISPs from accessing that, or extort for money. Thus resulting in multiple versions of the internet, different in size and community.

By extort I assume you mean "charge". Yes, ISPs will charge other companies to use their infrastructure. Not sure what's weird about that.

>Because of ISPs also potentially putting limits on which news you are allowed to view, it becomes a tool of brainwashing, not free speech. It is fuvking scary.

Are you joking? You're on reddit. This is probably legitimately one of the worst places you can visit if you don't want to have your information or news curated for you.

>THAT, is why it is not a good idea to give this much freedom to the big ISPs. In an ideal world the competition would be awesome. But it will not realistically happen.

I find it equal parts hilarious and pathetic how people on reddit desperately try to make the case that certain industries somehow don't work in a free market, when the reality is you have a natural proclivity towards controlling markets through government regulation, and you're looking for any excuse to do so. Laying infrastructure for the internet is a costly business, but it's not astronomically expensive. There are many industries that require huge upfront costs that still operate in a free market. The facility to create high power processors cost in the billions of dollars. Laying some fiber in a densely populated urban area and then growing from there is not some insurmountable problem for the free market. We **know** that this is not a problem with the free market, because google has tried to break into the market, and they were halted due to local regulations. This also nullifies your contrived argument about predatory pricing, because google would be able to outlast comcast if a price war even happened, which it wouldn't.
$C: Yes because murder directly infringes on people's rights. There's a difference between the rule of law, and government regulation. The government **should** protect people's actual rights. The government **should not** control markets or what consenting people agree to. So for instance, if there are arcane laws on the books that say you can't install your own fiber on a telephone pole because of "reasons", that's bad government regulation. If the government stops me from punching you in the face, that's good government regulation. Why? Because in one instance, the government is doing its job: protecting your rights. In the other instance, it's using arbitrary rules to stop people from doing something that doesn't harm anybody.

Get it yet?
$C: Look man, all I really set out to say was that people only organize when effects of political decisions noticeably detriment their day to day lives, and the repeal of Net Neutrality is a good example of a problem that will be tangible in many Americans lives.

There's potential for organization there. But you harping on an issue which has literally died in the water, bitching about how no one did anything despite the fact that it's waaay out of all the major news cycles, is doing fuck-all. 

You have to work with the agenda setting MSM gives you and wait for a crisis big enough to spur action, that's when you take ALL the action, and a restoration of fair elections will undoubtedly be a part of it.

EDIT

> If we can't put someone in power that represents us then we don't have the support from within that makes changes, how do you not see that?

just wanted to say this is almost manic in its exaggeration. Bernie's loss isn't some death of elected officials. He's a signifier of the DNC, sure, but we always knew that the bigger the org, the more money it handles on a global scale, the more corrupt its suspect to be. Gotta give er a little kickstart sometime.

Still plenty going on in lesser elections.
$C: You're thinking of arpanet.  Mainstream internet, aka www, wasn't available until later in the 80s when DNS became popularized.
$C: Lol
$C: > They would be heavily discouraged from building more roads, and heavily discouraged from upgrading old roads

That is exactly what's currently happened with the NN vote. Under the telecommunications act of 1996 Telecoms were given tens of billions of dollars by the federal government in order to lay fiber optic wires across the whole country. Needless to say it didn't happen, and now the repeal of NN allows the ISPs to use their same shitty infrastructure while jacking up prices to those who want any semblance of respectable speed.

The repeal of NN has done the opposite of what you think, because corporations can not be trusted to look out for the better interest of American citizens. Corporations are not built around any formal Constitution of principles, they are built around the generation of revenue, at any cost, with any advantage.
$C: > These companies need to be broken up like ATT back in the day and have their regional monopolies destroyed

> Tell me, how would that benefit the consumer? Honestly.

Honestly? Honestly? If ATT provides internet services to say, 35% of users in America, the revocation of NN enables them to charge both on the supply and the demand end, selling various internet media as product to their users, and their users as product to media creators. Because, god knows, 20% of those internet users are between ATT and Comcast, so there's not great incentive to compete when your opponent is a known widely as one of the worst, most willfully deceptive, greedy companies in America.

Prices can ONLY go up as a result of this. So, if ATT were broken into say, 3 new companies, each of which only controls about 10% of the American internet userbase, that bargaining and price setting power greatly fades, while the leftover small businesses would have more incentive to actually compete against one another to provide lower prices.

Alternatively you have a government regulated program which provides baseline internet services to everyone at a flat rate, (think USPS) and then the remaining big ISPs (Verizon, TWC, Comcast) get to compete to provide better services above the minimal level (like Fedex, UPS)


EDIT: To run with this mail analogy, the FCC's vote today would be the equivalent of the USPS announcing that there will be an extra fee, paid to them, to both send and receive each of your various newspaper and/or magazine subscriptions each month, unless those publications were owned by the USPS itself. It's completely fucked, and anti-competitive. It's not often that capitalism benefits from regulation, but in the case net neutrality, which preserves capitalism's vital tenet of competition, it absolutely does. 

$C: Honestly, if we had a market where actual competition for high-speed providers existed, I'd be sitting a little better with a lot of this; not sitting well, but a little better. As of now, a lot of us have no alternatives and will just have to deal with rate hikes, internet site packaging, throttling, and whatever else they want to throw our way. Breaking up regional monopolies would offer alternatives needed. I'm assuming you're aware of the lack of service providers and just want to troll though.
$C: > ruining entire corporations always encourages investment!

It does when the corporations there have a stranglehold on one of the country's primary means of communication. It's not like killing off those companies is going to mean no internet, internet has become a staple of the entire western world.
$C: Tell yourself whatever you want bro. Makes it that much sadder
$C: The founding fathers were soldiers and because of that, they totally knew what was going to happen to technology in the next 240 years. You clearly believe your argument is good, I find it to be pretty fucking stupid. Beyond that the founding fathers did not set the constitution in stone. There is a system in place to make changes to the document because the writers, in their wisdom, understood that the world, and the needs of the people, would change over time.
$C: Name something that had the equivalent killing power of an AR15 that existed during the revolutionary war
$C: I will bring tank do not worry yourself comrade
$C: We were too, once. 
$C: Hm... That's not what I've heard. Where are you seeing this? I'm pretty sure I've seen tax raises for everyone up to 100,000. And if you make that much, I don't even think you're middle class anymore. Unless it's because you own a company. But even then, you're being selfish. Only like 24% of people will get cuts.

Also, they're cutting a ton of deductions which will counter the tax cuts. And a lot of the cuts are set to expire in a few years. Removing the individual ACA mandate will also raise insurance prices for everyone who stays with insurance, which will also counter any tax cuts.
$C: Liking an aspect of a party does not constitute liking the whole party. And a party not having been bought yet on an issue doesn't mean they can't be bought. I do not trust either side of the aisle and I don't trust politicians. Voting (D) isn't going to make this problem go away.
$C: He has evolved like my pikachu.
$C: > Am I saying killing over Internet policies is okay? No, it isn't.

Hrm. Why not, exactly? I'm not saying precisely that net neutrality rules should be killed over, but that's a pretty drastic blanket statement. What if the next "internet policy" was to remove access to the internet from regular civilians? Would that be an an internet policy worth killing over?
$C: Republicans call it a “second amendment solution” when they use it to threaten Democratic politicians who have been elected into office. 

Why can’t we call for a second amendment solution for unelected Ajit Pai selling our freedom to the highest bidder?
$C: Violence isn’t the answer. True. But If they should decide that violence IS the answer to our words that continually oppose their policies-  

Let’s hope we never have to live out that scenario
$C: Violence is the only thing that can actually scare these sociopaths. They don't give two shits about what reddit has done. They don't care about the complaints. They're laughing in your faces when you say you say "violence isn't right". What, all they have to do is ignore a few angry people while they continue their corruption? How adorable. 
$C: Yes
$C: Then a punch right in the gut can do unless T-mobile is into armpit stuff
$C: I didn't threaten anyone, I just said he deserves one.
$C: The FTC. They've been doing so since Clinton signed the open internet bill in the mid 90s. Not sure how you missed this, but the FCC just handed back COMPLETE CONTROL of the internet(not really, just to enforce the "open internet" laws) to the FTC. A regulatory body. Who has 2 decades of experience in internet law. Versus the FCC who has 2 years.
$C: Ok that's your city's fault as well. The feds don't give a fuck when a city signs a contract with an ISP. That's on the city. And since NN, Comcast paid a very large fine for fast lanes. Naw I'm playing, it was for overcharging people for equipment. That fine was paid to the FCC. If they do it again? They'll pay a fine to the FTC. Big companies do big company things.
$C: > That's what happened with the 2014 Verizon court case

Different court.  

>they said ISP are title 1 and thus FCC has no jurisdiction over them at least from my understanding

They did.  But that was because there was no precedent from previous cases.  In 2005, Madison River would have gone to a court that is much more friendly to the FCC than the District of Columbia court that Verizon tried in.  With a precedent from a previous court ruling, the Verizon case would have gone completely the other way as they would have to honor the previous decision from the court previously (likely Verizon wouldn't have even brought suit because they knew they would lose).  There's a reason that Verizon brought suit in the DoC rather than New Jersery.
$C: Fair enough, but I dont think my mind is filled with venom.
$C: Occupy wall street never occupied wall street though. Their core tactic was never actually executed. That's why it failed. And not enough people participated. 
$C: Yup, which is a shame, because in other countries they have a culture of protest where it doesn't require such drastic circumstances before people will stand together for what they believe in. 
$C: Who's to tell the difference? We celebrate the rebels of the American Revolution but disagree with people who supported the crown. Tyranny is subjective as it depends on whose reaping the benefits of the exploitation.
$C: In my viewpoint, there was no major corporate (or private) transaction of funds went into the passing of the initial Title II regulations. If you have any evidence to suggest that there was I would love to read it. As to your other point, I find that Net neutrality is a perfect example of government regulation to benefit the public. They saw that there was a potential for corporations to further exploit the public and pushed to close that hole in the legal system so that they could not. Simply because you patch a software problem before it can be exploited and turned into a virus does not mean that that patch was any less needed. 
$C:  people are tired of being used and theyre finally ready to do something about it. something that will bring their wants to actual fruition. 

jesus christ kid get your shit together the world isnt some movie or show with a happy ending. seriously how have you not learned that by now? apparently you have a silver spoon up your ass while growing up. wars have been fought for freedom, slaves would still be around if not for war and death. but i guess that doesnt justify it either does it

seriously, you're so childish and simple minded. go on live in your fantasy world like you always have. 
$C: > I never said civil war

What's a "revolution" against Americans by Americans called again?
$C: I believe in the free market over a bloated federal government. Sorry if you're too stupid to grasp that viewpoint.
$C: Nice try bot, but this guy's not learning anything today.
$C: You understand ISPs have a monopoly in parts of the US? As in, you cant get any other service. So you really think cancelling would work in those scenarios? I think you're more than a little confused about all of this.
$C: Alright man, I concede.

Enjoy your Christmas break, and try not to stay up to late. It'll mess up your sleep cycle when you have to go back to school
$C: So you can't read either ? Awwh you're so special. I didn't tell you to kill yourself. You must not know big words. It's okay.
$C: But why would you be on the other side? Why would you defend this?

[Edit] Nevermind. Just read through your history, and turns out you're a racist MAGA stormtrooper with no historical perspective. May your culture perish.
$C: But not as a direct consequence of the revolution.
$C: Oh yes. Because a liberal who is flipping shit and calling supporter insane is *so* much better than me.
Go cry in the corner, like you types always go.
$C: I mean could YOU think of any way that an authoritarian one party ruled US could be overthrown? Only thing I can think of is total economic collapse. Or the world climate getting really REALLY bad.
$C: I am playing a character. 

A character that makes up the majority of ones of our political parties. 
$C: The ideal government would be anarchy.

It's what the right wants, and this is how much of the US views their leaders. Better if they weren't there. 

Which is why we're running our current experiment in Anarchy under Cheeto Benito. 
$C: Depends on where you are. Where I am, our home telephone company is very local. They also have a LOT of isssues. Phone constantly goes out and doesn't get fixed, we used to pay for things like caller id that just never did work, etc. 

But because of that, because that company, if Comcast fixes their issues within 2 days it's GREAT and everyone loves them, even though their system goes down as often as Hickory's. Problem is, even though Comcast forces us to PAY for phone (in their bundled cable/phone/internet thing), we can't actually RECEIVE phone service from them, because Hickory Telephone won't allow them to come in with phone lines.

So, yes. Sometimes you can start fucking over your customers only marginally less than the other guys and still gain customers. That doesn't mean you're treating your customers well, it means that you're using the shitty situation they're already in to your advantage.
$C: I didn't imply that NN or its repeal would end the internet. I mean we pay more to get mail faster from place to place..but in that instance we just need to get it sent quicker. I guess I just don't need Comcast telling me I can only read reddit for 5 minutes a day or I'll have to pay more. These companies are making money hand over fist. they just don't need another pass on offering sub par service. We have the slowest internet in the 1st world...it is pretty sad....
$C: Yeah and it's terrible i agree 
$C: And that's my point: you genuinely intend to go single-issue on NN, but without that perfect world we don't have, you can't.  This is why politicians can get away with flagrantly betraying the people.  There will always be someone who'll betray more, and your only means of opposing that will be to support the candidate who recently opposed (or at least failed to support) NN.

Edit: Off topic, but Saints Row IV was a masterpiece, and I love your username.  :)
$C: >Now you're misreading my post lol. Obama didn't put Ajit Pai in the FCC, he nominated him for a Commissioner Position

Lmao

If you honestly don't see how this system is set up then continue believing what you want. Goodbye
$C: But net neutrality at least prevents my only option from gouging me, throttling me, preventing me from seeing/loading/playing etc... Like you said, this may not happen even without the NN rules but why take them away? How are these rules limiting in any way to companies that are already worth billions? The potential negative consquences are not worth the potential income increase for giant telecoms.

 All these rules do is protect my access to the internet. I'd go a step further and say I wish it were made a utility like electricity. It certainly has become just as important in day to day life and making it affordable to all seems like a no-brainer to me.
$C: Hey, just noticed your account is only one day old and all it does is shit on democrats and the Reddit Left. Nice alt you've got there 
$C: /u/KaramCatastrophe would like to know how you got negative karma.

You could be regulating ISPs right now in your State if power was taken away from the FCC. 🤣
$C: You feel wrong.

$C: I stand by my original comment lol
$C: Thanks, I appreciate it!
$C: No no, Boris, listen me. When shill too hard, the Americans, they no believe.
$C: Actually they just busted themselves breaking a Reddit-wide rule by brigading people.  It's obvious that your post has been targeted by people not participating in this thread, and it has to be one of those 3 subreddits.  If admins can view the posts in a moderator queue they can see who talked about doing that.
$C: The Reddit administrators *did* speak to the moderators, and did so repeatedly. Each time, those same moderators either ignored the warnings they received, or merely claimed that they'd alter their behavior (and didn't).

Those "new rules" you mentioned were put into place because certain subReddits were actively gaming Reddit's voting algorithm in order to push their content to the top of the site. Reddit could have very easily chosen to simply close those communities, but they instead allowed them to stay open and accessible. Furthermore, the concerns voiced by those same communities amounted to "We don't like that you're not letting us cheat!" and "Anyone who disagrees with me is wrong!" hidden behind a veneer of standing up for free speech.

In short, the subReddits in question broke the rules (repeatedly), were warned (numerous times), and yet still decided to undermine the very site that was giving them a voice. Rather than taking that voice away, Reddit simply unplugged the megaphone, which – as has been covered – wasn't allowed in the building to begin with.
$C: Hshahahaha you're actually thinking these people are willing to have a civil discourse? You need to get some help because these delusions are seriously clouding your judgment 
$C:  Not with that attitude 
$C: You're a strange breed of asshole
$C: Bad FCC
$C: Can't you go back to the cult leadership and asked them to spoon feed you guys some new insults?  This last time that they programmed you all, they came up with the most pathic shit insult I've ever heard.  Soy boy sounds so desperate and contrived. (Let me know if you need the big words explained to you). I understand you're just a simpleton and that you're unlikely to ever have an independent thought, so it isn't your fault at all, but it's making you look extremely pathetic. 
$C: Wtf. Are there actually people who talk like this or is this a troll?
$C: Soy's fuckin' crap and Coldplay is poofter-ish, so leg it, dog
$C: The British guys weren’t killed. they were just politely, yet firmly, asked to leave
$C: > Let me ask you then, how will the government effectively monitor all internet providers to make sure they are not shaping data? 

The government likely won't monitor the Internet providers and it will be up to consumers and businesses to notice the problem and report to the FCC, which is what they do now. Net Neutrality gives them a foothold to argue against anti-consumers practices.

> How will internet providers ensure that their own staff does not shape data on their own?

How do any businesses stop their employee's from breaking the law? Once again, when consumers and businesses notice they will issue an FCC complaint based on net neutrality. It doesn't matter who in the ISP throttled the data.

As for the rest you are comparing apple to oranges, the fact is net neutrality works and there is no reason to remove it, it only benefits the ISP's themselves.

$C: EDIT: fixed the comment chain.


>    Why would you do this to someone who you supposedly love? >Seems a bit cruel.

You have to have a view of suffering that it is so terrible that there is no other to reason to live, simply because suffering exists. If you think this is true, kill yourself right now. If there is a reason you are alive, that same reason applies to your kid.

Now most people so far say "the only thing keeping me alive is survival instincts" and then i have to list all the things that make life worth living, even though there is suffering. People actively choose to do things that cause suffering, like climbing Everest and report back that it was worth it.

Ultimately anti-natalism (the desire to not have kids) is a challenge to pull your life out of nihilism and find a meaning that makes your life worth the suffering inherent to being alive. And even if you can't come up with your own solution, your kid may be one of the many many people who DOES value their own life over suffering.

>You should not create them if you cannot observe the rights that >they will have once they are created.

The arrogance in the statement "a child has a right to not be born into a world of shit" is so incredibly top tier, it doesn't deserve respect. The world has never been not-shit. There has never been a time of more wealth and prosperity for humans (even poor ones) that this statement is a slap in the face to anyone who has ever existed, including those who birthed you.

So, with that level of offence in mind, and the logical argument about your value of your life in the face suffering, please kill yourself.


$C: > You try to dismiss everything I said

Huh? You said one line saying I was wrong with no backup. So yeah. I did dismiss everything you said.

>shows me that you did some extensive research on my post history. 

I skimmed 2 pages. Takes like 3mins to do that.

>You're probably too stupid to realize that my post history doesn't invalidate my arguments in any way.

Please elucidate what your stunning arguments are Mr Supreme Right Commenter™. I must have "missed them" in the face of your stunning brilliance.

>Don't worry about that, anything that comes out of your mouth can't be considered an insult.

Cool. So you're not a basement dwelling weeb who's too angry and hateful (because of the hate subreddits you dwell in) to improve yourself enough to get laid, so instead you fantasize about raping celebrities and preventing suicidal people getting help to gratify your resentment and hurt feelings?

You know eventually you're going to have to look in the mirror and realise that the monster is part of yourself. Stay the fuck off reddit, MGTOW will just sail you down the river and laugh behind your back whilst you buy their shitty t-shirts (metaphorically) and the porn subs make money off your pathetic excuse for a sex life and your families love drifts further and further away.

>Ah right. Classic. You had mommy issues too when you were 14? Did your parents beat you when you were a kid?

This is the second time I've seen you say this. Must be .. your issues, not mine? Fuck ur mum is the standard 15yr old CS:GO insult, hence the jab at the end of the more eloquent sentence. I think the contrast works well. 
$C: For fricks sake. I've had all these arguments before. Okay let's go around the hobby horse again!

>They all decided to procreate knowing their children could end up not liking existence. It was a selfish decision. So fuck them, I have no problem giving them a metaphorical slap in the face.

So you blame your parents for not liking your life. Good work. There are ways to exist in this world that justify the cost of living in it. It's your responsibility to find what that is.

>Pick your logical fallacy: Argument from nature or from tradition?

It's not even an argument, it's casual shaming. You should realize that you are the first generation to put away their reproductive rights because some internet idiots said it was a good idea.

>You can't really decide to stop caring about your own suffering.

Why would I want to? The Christians believe suffering builds character. Neitschze talks about suffering being necessary in life. The whole argument that suffering is a negative is the crux of this issue (like I keep poking at) and if you have an understanding of the world that can see positivity in suffering, then the whole argument falls apart.

>Survival instincts are a thing, because of this.

I know I included this in my response to the other guy. Every anti-natalist says this, as if the only reason they can function is because of survival instincts. How about this:

>On top of that, empathy and love for people who would suffer from my death is not out of the equation. I'll gladly keep existing if I can prevent more suffering than how much I cause.

The quickest route to ending your own suffering and those you love is to shoot them in their sleep, they would feel nothing. Then kill yourself. You have just saved them X decades of suffering. If that's what you care about, there is logically no better way to accomplish your goals.
$C: No I am a fan, the sarcasm was the subtext. It's okay, have a go anyway.

I said *Almost all guns* are in the hands of republicans, which is factually correct. You can go google that shit yourself.  *Almost* does not mean *All*. I am not republican and i own a gun. 
$C: While I'm not opposed to that idea, according to Pew, only around 20-35% of individuals own guns, with fewer than half of American households having one.

http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/06/04/a-minority-of-americans-own-guns-but-just-how-many-is-unclear/
$C: > Almost every citizen in the US owns a gun. 

lol, what? No, statistically, yes, but practically, no.
$C: It seems like Republican voters and Democratic voters both support Net Neutrality, and that policymakers who oppose it are receiving an lot of money from telecom companies.  

Since Net Neutrality, as it exists today, is a government regulation, its being pitched by Republicans as a reduction of government interference.  But from where I'm sitting, it seems blatantly anti-consumer, pro-big business, which would explain why these big businesses are spending so much money on politicians.
$C: Well clearly not enough of them care to save Net Neutrality, otherwise their totally-not-corrupt-as-shit representatives would have heard their loud protests, right? Oh wait, it was crickets? Yeah. 
$C: Your point A makes a basic math error.  If my assumption is that Democrats own no guns, then Republicans would also own no guns, as 2 x 0 = 0.

As for point B, Republican voters may claim to support net neutrality, but they are happy to vote for politicians who don't.  As I'm sure you're aware, how people feel about issues does not have as large an effect as how people vote on those same issues.

$C: I love how you're just assuming all of these things as if you know me. 
$C: I have none--I was going off of what a previous comment said in that case, which is why I'm quite open to being corrected if that's not the case.  But there is, notably, the recent case at Wilfred-Laurier, where a teaching assistant was sanctioned and told she was in violation of the law simply for showing a video clip debating the use of trans pronouns in a classroom.  It is a new bill and I'm not a Canadian, so that is the only case I can presently reference.  Again, if I'm wrong about the content of the bill, I'd rather be corrected than not.
$C: You make an interesting point about the power of the police officer in that situation, but admit yourself that the cop is a representative of the government. Besides, it is not wholly up to the cop. The judge and jury still have a say, and the cop does not write the laws. Collectively, it is indeed the government which does these things. The cop can't arrest you for a law the government did not pass.

$C: > I'd prefer this scenario than have the US taxpayer be held hostage by insurance companies. 

That's going to happen with or without the subsidies. So as long as there are insurance companies and we're stuck with a multi payer system, wouldn't you want there to be subsidies so that more people can have health insurance? Because that drives down costs overall for the rest of us, because they don't have to go to emergency rooms  for easily-preventable illnesses. 

Unless you're playing the long game and thinking that you'd rather the system gets even more terrible now in the hope that we can have single payer in the future.

$C: **American-led intervention in the Syrian Civil War**

The American-led intervention in the Syrian Civil War refers to US support of Syrian opposition and the Federation of Northern Syrian during the course of the Syrian Civil War, and active involvement of US military against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and against the al-Nusra Front from 2014. Since 2017, US has also targeted Syrian military positions.

The United States first supplied the rebels of the Free Syrian Army with non-lethal aid (including food rations and pickup trucks), but quickly began providing training, cash, and intelligence to selected Syrian rebel commanders. During the Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, two US programs attempted to assist the Syrian rebels.

$C: Zero data charging for selected services is a perfect example of a non-competitive advantage. For instance let's say if Netflix paid Verizon to allow people to stream Netflix without counting towards their data cap. That Is a huge incentive for people to use Netflix over other services and means that unless your company has the money to be zero charged then it's extremely difficult to compete.

I agree.  It is a step towards saner politics.

I stand by my original point, which is that the win in Alabama is meaningful.  It's a signal to the Republican party that balls-to-the-wall far-right politics that disregard everything in pursuit of the first 10 amendments is not going to win elections, *even* in a deep red state.

NN doesn't regulate what they can charge now.

Why would they need to calculate prices more effectively if they have no competition in any given region, or sufficiently little competition they can simply pick the same high prices without fear of being undercut?

> perhaps charging prices in proportion to bandwidth

All ISPs already do this.

> offer products consumers may like better

In what way does NN prevent that?

> Here is a primer.

And that's exactly the point I was making. It's not the case that regulation is never appropriate and good, yet here you are giving me a primer on "free market" that does not address anything about the internet at all.

U mean other than the fact that the entire DNC was conspiring to push him out? He was fighting BOTH political parties and I don't know that I believe the official story at the ballot box for that very reason. 

> and if you think it was all dishonest democracy, you should spend less time in an echo chamber. I don't really understand your point.

Actually I think you do - I think it is all a dishonest democracy. However, I don't know what that has to do with an "echo chamber" considering that a seemingly equal number of people on the left and right had concerns about election fraud - of which both sides were probably right to a degree. The right just stopped talking about it because their guy won.

And I don't think Trump necessarily lost. I think the "dishonest" part of the election was that Bernie won and Trump would have lost to Bernie. Of course, Hilary actually lost. Nobody wanted her - on the left or right. The DNC just hoped they could lie themselves to a victory. 
$C: 
I see reddit posturing nobly about a free and open internet and at the same time I see them acting somewhat less nobly in other ways. Furthermore, I also see these issues as related. That's where I'm coming from.
$C: And if Google decides to derank your website? 
$C: > Net neutrality verbiage pertains only to ISPs, so all of this is moot.

Good job being a hypocrite. 

Reddit doesn't control my access to the internet, but it does control my access to the most popular content aggregate and voted-forums on the internet. With other competitors like Facebook, Google / Youtube, Twitter - all tightening the screws against opposite opinions, my freedom to "go elsewhere" is becoming just as limited. If Reddit and every other social media throttle my political opinions the end result is the same as a block from the ISP. 

**Gab.ai is attempting to create a free alternative and was instantly blocked and throttled by Google, Apple and some Domain Registrars - so because of your arbitrary claim we can't even start a proper competitor to this anti-competitive social media oligopoly.**

Gee, I wonder where we could stop this at the source. If there was only some way to figure out.

Do you not understand? Obama appointed Pai. Obama reclassified the internet stripping it of the protections it had under the law (1996 telecommunications act - the thing SOPA/PIPA tried to undo, DO YOU EVEN REMEMBER?).

Tom Wheeler put in *forebeared* regulations. These were *never in effect*.

This vote now is to not to let them go ahead. They were NOT law. They were about to become law and this vote stops that.

Do you not get it? Comcast couldn't push through stuff through a bought legislature, so they bought Obama and Hillary to control it form the executive branch.


"BUT MUH DEMOCRATS PROTECT ME" is literally the most ignorant thing when we're talking about two totally separate branches of government.


Nothing the republican congress can do (short of dissolving the FCC) can touch net neutrality. It's ALL the presidency at this point and has been since Obama ordered the regulation of the internet under his FCC.

I don't care if you vote democrat or republican, just stop knuckle dragging and assuming that everyone is 'on a side'. It's not how it works. This is what Comcast is betting on: you being too passive and accepting of any D to notice what the executive branch does, while being mad at the R branch.
If you were a republican, it'd be the other way around.

Both are beneficial to Comcast's long-term plans.
$C: > I'm black. I vote for Democrats not only because they see me as a human and recognize the importance of racial equality for all Americans, 

Is that why black americans in solid blue cities have fared significantly worse than in purple districts?

https://www.vox.com/2016/9/1/12750102/black-lives-matter-democrats-memo

Protip: if you can't threaten the folks who represent you by voting the alternative, they won't ever prioritize your needs.


Unions are not a liberal thing. They're a conservative social philosophy, as are tariffs or protectionism. Liberal philosophy, economically, is free trade and free markets.


And democrats back technocrat billionaires, republicans land-resource billionaires. I don't see a 'party of the people', nor do I want a party of the people. That's stupid. What is good for someone in Kansas is not good for someone in Compton.

> But not only that, I also vote for them because Democrats understand economics and Republicans do not.

I literally hold a degree in economics. The president has almost no control over it. Congress and the federal reserve have much more, but even they lack strong influence in what you'd consider 'day to day' economics.

> Whenever Democrats are in office the economy is doing much better. Compare the Clinton era to the Bush era. Republicans do not understand economics. All they understand are tax cuts for the rich.

Ironically, every single time this happens you have a republican congress + republican president, and tax cuts happen. Things take 3-8 years to take effect on grand scales, including the ability to measure it in historical context, so the effects are felt under the following president's term. And this is coming from someone who thinks both democrat and republican economics are pandering stupidity due to the 50/50 measure they do.

Example: cutting taxes for the rich is beneficial IF you cut government spending by the same amount (the reason should be obvious). Otherwise, you're just giving the rich free money that has to be paid later.

Example: welfare can be beneficial at raising people out of poverty IF the poor can save. Democrats have gone to *extreme* lengths to insuring black Americans can't save money. That's why everything is a handout/entitlement that's paid third party or on cards that reload monthly and no cash is actually given. If blacks could save, they'd stray from the party because they wouldn't economically depend on democrats. Or are you unaware of the fracture of the black upper-middle class that's increasingly becoming independent? https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/much-is-required_us_5908a07ee4b0bb2d0871ff81

I can post leftist news posts that address this all the time. I'm not even touching other ideologies covering of this, such as Thomas Sowell. So try to pretend there's 'spin' or 'twisting' on this one: I'd love to see it.


But go on about how democrats are this holy party that is 'so much better'. Because from where I stand, being shitty and terrible vs. being shitty and slightly less terrible is still shitty and terrible.

So I hold them to that standard. I can, and will continue to be independent, and will simply vote third party or for the person over the party.


There's no false equivalency, your blind tribalism leads you to see yourself as somehow 'good'. But no, your party is stupid and dangerous too. I don't care if it's 'less stupid and dangerous'. Shape up and start putting liberty and individuals first, and stop with your collectivist, controlling, authoritarian, wage-slave enabling, billionaire-benefitting policies and we'll talk.

Till then, you're just a republican minus the KKK hood. And that's the truth of the matter. Change and back off progressivism and collectivism, or let the republicans continue to dominate - they're the original authoritarians, identity politickers, and collectivists, and they'll win that fight every time.


If it means 30 years of republican rule to destroy and reform the democrat party - so be it. And from the polls, more and more Americans are agreeing with that and wanting to see the democrat party return to the carter/clinton/tip o neal era of neoliberalism.
$C: "liberal" lol k dude. I voted for Trump but obviously since I disagree with you on NN I'm a "liberal"

$C: >You just said what i said, but added that I’m wrong.

Yes because your logic was wrong. How can it be Obamas fault when he did not put him in the position of power that Trump himself did? Obama didn't even nominate him, it was McConnell. 

So again this is all on the republicans. 

But hey if you wanna blame Obama, the very guy who imposed net neutrality. Go ahead.

Like, i've said before you're wrong. 


>Well, I can recommend that you quit arguing,

Not really arguing as you've provided 0 argument. Just flawed logic. 


Again you think it's the guy who literally gave us net neutrality, Obama, is responsible for taking it away. Because he hired Pai, and only did so at the reccomendation of the Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnel. Then Trump got in office, made Pai the head of the FCC, and he took away NN. 

Like I've said this is on republicans and Trump. 


$C: I mean, why wouldn't they throttle something 99.9% illegal for their network health? Seems like a reasonable plan to me.
$C: Do not confuse intent with results. Do you think Mom & Pop shops have the money to buy politicians? Or is it the "megacorporations" that pay politicians to create more roadblocks for their competetion? I don't care what regulations "exist" to do, it is what they actually do that is the problem.
$C: I defend this because I am for capitalism, not globalism. I'd rather have to contend with an ISPs ability to throttle my bandwidth rather than the government tell me what I can and can't see. And by that I mean if they wanna charge a premium for a faster service for media streaming, it is no different than the packages I already have to choose from. 

Additionally, we have ONE choice of providers where I live. One. Comcast. Across the street? They have clearwire. They cannot use comcast which is literally 100 feet away. Why cant I have clear wire? Because the local government is allowed the leverage to let them monopolize an area. I already have shitty service. Comcast doesn't care how much I bitch because they know I have no alternative. I live in a large city and have shit internet already because of this. My connections were faster and more stable last year when I lived in the middle of nowhere in louisiana and had a choice of 2 competing satellite providers. They were constantly trying to outdo each other and provided a good service to keep me as a customer.

Government regulation leads to what I deal with now, and I don't care for it. Our net goes down weekly. Its slow at peak times. Its expensive already. NN didn't do a damn thing to help me as a consumer when it was enacted, and I don't care for the government thinking it can censor what i have access to anyways. 

This is why I am for a free market in this industry.
$C: Prime example of a r/t_d user.

Big shock.
$C: Yes. Thats definitely funny. Its not a horrible situation at all.

There's a list of events threatening the death of another. However, my link showing they upvoted a comment where he said he would drive a truck into counter-protesters seems to have been deleted, so that may be untrue now. However, the threat of violence is still very real.
$C: I mean. I do not know the sources because I am not American and am not up to speed with all that happens in your country. That is why I ask. Thanks

$C: Had no idea. That's if you have negative karma on /r/politics exclusively?
$C: Nice back-pedalling there, mate.  It's ok.  You don't have to openly admit that you didn't know jack shit about the other side of the argument or attempted to find out, and was content to go along with whatever the rest of reddit was """organically""" pushing to the front page.  
  
We'll just leave it at a knowing wink and nudge, but try not to do it in your future outrages.  It's just detrimental to yourself.  
$C: FYI, the main mod of /r/nonetneutrality is also a moderator of /r/GoldAndBlack, an anti-Trump ancap sub. If you consider your attitude from an outsider's perspective, as well as more broadly the attitude and actions of the reddit administration more broadly (Ellen Pao, /u/spez, etc.) it's hard not view net neutrality as fitting into some kind of censorship agenda.

>The opposing arguments are so ridiculous that to get to any valid points you have to go through a bunch of non logical reasoning and a bunch of morons using hyperbole to make people defending Net Neutrality seem crazy

Not sure how what you're doing is any better.
$C: I dont' think you understand how seed capital and investor funding works
$C: I was simply making a point about the fact that the_Donald's subscriber numbers are rampantly inflated, and not a metric to use when estimating their popularity.
$C: Yeah, the leftists own Twitter now.  Need a safe space?
$C: Because it's ShitRedditSays, not ShitTrumpSupportsSay.  One look at their front page and you can see it's not exclusively about Trump supporters.
$C: The fact that you can say stuff like that here kinda goes against the “echo chamber” argument. Different ideas get posted, the ideas the majority of people don’t like/disagree with get voted down. Assholes (I would hope) get removed. 
$C: I'm so glad they got arrested.
$C: Leslie Jones was harassed and doxxed repeatedly.  Milo... got his feelings hurt?
$C: I always thought doxxing was a leftist thing but apparently you're ok with it too?
$C: It's conspiracy redpill garbage, sorry.
$C: LOL Right a deregulated market would *never* take advantage of customers. Never ever ever.  And a VPN!  Thank god we would have to use a VPN to access content we can currently access without a problem today!  Great idea - let's create a problem for no reason so we have to use workarounds just to access the same content we have today. You should work at the White House. 
$C: No, just smarter than you. Try not to huff too much glue while reading Stormfront. 
$C: Dude you're retarded. He already said he contacted the FBI in regards to you implying that you want to skin the chairman of the FCC alive.. and you keep talking about it.

I hope you're behind like 7 proxies.
$C: I'm literally smarter and more educated than you.
$C: They DONT have an equal voice though. Their votes are worth far more than a voter's in say Illinois. I'll try to find the video I saw recently, I think it was a wendover productions video?

Either way, the crux of the issue is that small states get more representation than big states, which is just plain horseshit
$C: That is solid proof because of his character and the character of his victims. Or do you think someone that has been thrown out of office twice for ethics violations is someone to be trusted?
$C: I find myself put in a position where reality has no sway so the only thing do to is blast very extreme rhetoric and hope it trips something. 
$C: > What money am I raking in?

You (being majority Republican states in general and the south in particular) have a very large [net income from Federal programs.](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/which-states-are-givers-and-which-are-takers/361668/)

>Are you aware of the fact that I am person, and am not, in fact, a Southern state?

Weird, then, that I was talking about southern states, not you personally. 

>8. Did you know that Pepe the Frog is a symbol of white supremacy?
$C: > How is any of that the case? You said “they take more than they give” which is a completely false statement.

By and large, Republican majority states and the south specifically pay less to the Federal government than they receive in Federal expenditures. That sounds like freeloading to me. 

>Sounds like a 12 year old to me.

Sounds like you can't handle reality because your feelings got hurt, greedy whiner. 
$C: > You would be banned in a ton of subreddits if this were targeted at any group other than Southerners.

Here's the good news: unlike things like your skin color, or your sexual orientation, being a "southerner" by my definition is something that you can *change* if you care enough to try. 
$C: > Bahahahahaha you are so salty, please don’t come near my farm. Nothing will ever grow again.

My goodness. You're just grasping so hard at everything that you possibly can to give value to yourself. I don't care whether or not you're particularly good at farming. That's not my problem. If you want to make money, you grow the food and we'll eat it. You can sit on your laurels (or should I say, bushels) as long as you want and that doesn't change the fact that you are **greedy** and you have no problem with taking money from cities and plowing it into your pudunk little town. 

More importantly, I don't even particularly care that you *do* that; what I care about is the hypocritical shit about "we are the lifeblood of America" and all that absolute trash bullshit. No one is, because we all are. Just as you support us with food, we support you with tax dollars; and in many other ways. I want you to **respect** us instead of denigrating us. 


$C: > The "people from other parts of the country are inferior" attitude is what caused the civil war.

What caused the civil war is **people owning other people**. 

>Cool your jets and don't be an assole to your countrymen on the basis of living far away.

Yeah, I'm going to go ahead and disregard the absolutely outrageous bullshit you just dropped on the floor and continuing to characterize reality in a truthful way. 
$C: Not what caused the civil war 
$C: Ha so you pull copout comment cause you been proven wrong.  Nah we live with most entitled people on the planet.  And you're not on the right side.
$C: So all of your arguments are "this might happen"

I don't subscribe to that ideology. I can look at how the internet functioned before NN, and know how it will look once NN is gone.
$C: >your own mods are doing something much much worse

lmao, its so wrong to have freedom of political speech!!!

> post an article on Lane Davis

Jesus your one fucking talking point that you bring up any time you need to talk about TD. Note how I did not try to attribute to you, as a liberal, any liberal violence like for instance the recent leftist shooter who tried to kill Republicans and shot and injured Steve Scalise.

BUT SOME GUY ON REDDIT, A SITE FOR SOCIAL RETARDS, WAS A SOCIAL RETARD AND KILLED A FAMILY MEMBER. YOU ARE IMPLICATED AS A RESULT!!!!! DRUUUUUMPFFFF IMPEACCCCHHHHH!!!

I literally do not care if the mods of the subreddit delete the story, it's not about Trump, it's about a user of the website. I honestly wish you would post it more often so you can get even more upset about this anecdotal bullshit you think matters.

Here's an idea, you limey retard, walk outside and go to your nearest Mosque, I hear they are all the rage in Merry ol' England these days, and tell them they need to accept Trans people. You have a real hard on for trans people, so why not spend time pushing the progressive agenda forward and talk to them? You realize I won't listen to you, as many times as you go, "wah someone died!!!", right? Ok, so, it's a better use of your time to go get beheaded for standing up for trans rights, right?
$C: Sounds like something a rifle toting pizzagator would say. Why do you hate pizza parlours so much? Don't go shooting one up, now. 
$C: You said speech is "abuse" not "opinion" (isn't that just your opinion?). So my question stands, when do we start shutting down this "abuse"? Where do we start? People who "abuse" Trump? Or is it only "abuse" when it hurts liberal feefees?

Can't have it both ways, cuck. Can't pretend muh internet is a human right but free speech all just depends on what cucks deem to be okay.
$C: It helps the companies that actively censor the internet pay less money for bandwidth. This is the only logical reason why they would shill for it as hard as they do. They're not virtuous, moral actors.

Like reddit. See OP.
$C: Maybe you should have specified

Not to mention, I've no doubt he's done it countless times, just this time he got caught 
$C: Sorry you're upset Reddit is hypocritical
$C: He's right, though. You should respond to his point. Why do so few NN supporters like free speech?
$C: And let's end this conversation with this important note.

**Spez is the greatest, haha jokes on you!** <-- You thought you'd get away with it? Not this time either haha!

Have a nice day everyone.
$C: So you're saying that what I posted is incorrect? Then please, provide a reputable source to dispute it. 

If not, you're just a typical leftist; willfully ignorant and useless.

$C: https://i.imgur.com/BqU6r8k.jpg

Winning
$C: The details are the important thing. The government can't ensure that we are not censored without placing a huge burden on them and thus raising the cost of doing business. This hurts everyone and reduces the efficiency of the internet, limiting the ways companies can process traffic. I'm against net neutrality. The name makes it sound like it is good for humanity, but it is most certainly not a step in the right direction. 
$C: You really think net neutrality keeps the internet unregulated? Holy shit they are good or you're incredibly stupid. 

$C: Yeah ISP's don't have a say, that power rests with the state dept.  I'd rather have my choice of ISP rather than have the choice made by the state.
$C: It creates a regulatory framework that stops small business from being able to enter the market.  Large companies have no problem negotiating this framework or even not complying with it as they can simply lobby and use political influence to allow them to not follow the rules.   For example, Comcast was able to argue that it's IP based streaming service should not be counted against my bandwidth caps during Title II NN.  Regulation don't mean shit when you own the regulators.  Actually they mean quite a bit, you can use them to stifle competition and secure your monopoly.
$C: The guy above him said it was common sense, asking for his understanding of NN is obviously relevant, and clearly going to be different to his opinion on it, because he holds the opposite opinion.

$C: Clearly we disagree but my opposition of net neutrality is just as valid as your support of it.
$C: > I'm still waiting for a decent argument from them...

How about this? 

I just don't like it.
$C: > in the last 10 years, what's the longest you've gone without using the internet?

Months, when I was in areas of the world that don't know what the internet even is.  After about a week I didn't miss it.

>Or, more easily, are you prepared to be cut off from it tomorrow? forever?

Sure.  Aside from not being able to argue with people on reddit, the biggest change would be having to go to the store more.  Much like above, after about a week I probably wouldn't even miss it.

>I guess more importantly, how are tax dollars paying for internet?

Well, for one internet subsidies for the poor that were introduced in 2016.  
$C: Trump is not even close to being "the richest and most powerful man on earth." But here's a destabilizing factor for ya: Trump is gonna get impeached but not before he does whatever damage he can and he's gonna pardon all his fucking buddies and everyones gonna walk away with a slimy wad of cash. Russia has nothing to do with this directly! That's not what I said, but they sure as shit have something to do with the GOP and my boi Mueller is gonna find it out.
$C: Retarded sexist. 
$C: He's just speaking his native language.
$C: Nah, just bored of you. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Hahaha. Now youre just having to turn a blind eye because you know you're wrong. You've already said I'm right. Each one of these stopped themselves. They suffered in investment and sales. The market stopped it. At the time of net neutrality implementation there were no problems. Wasn't broke and Obama fixed it. 
$C: And aol died due to their work habits, only tells you that company’s won’t do that cause it’s a stupid idea
$C: Where is aol at then? No one wanted to pay for internet time, if you need to be reminded again, you’re some young ass person lol
$C: Oh hey how’s it going?
$C: And yet you're replying to me, not OP. 
$C: I don't think you understand. I don't give a fuck about other people much less what they think. They're jokes to me because they trigger the hell out of people.

Sounds like you're Ajitated
$C: Look this a good effort so you'll still get that A, but you have to include Nazi or literally Hitler at least once to get the A+.
$C: Not to say they do or don't, but there's LGBT individuals who aren't Democrats.

The Pink Pistols, for example, are an LGBT group which advocates for responsible gun ownership. This is why they're banned from marching in various pride parades.

Incidentally, as soon as the DNC began supporting gay rights (2014?), local Libertarian Parties (began supporting gay rights in the 70s) was also banned from participating in some pride parades.

Edit: I said *some.* Specifically, [Olympia, WA.](http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/06/23/banned-from-pride-for-being-a-gay-libertarian-right-to-marry-clashes-with-right-to-carry-at-gay-pride-event)

 had a different response entirely.

$C: Whatever helps you sleep at night. 
$C: Sometimes I wonder if you guys are paid, or really are that stupid. 
$C: Again, trying to change the meaning of words. There's a difference between statuatory rape and actual forced rape. And in the article I posted, it was both. 
$C: It's an example of the effect it has. How do you think 11+ million illegals are making a living in the US?
$C: Because they wanted $100 billion a year from the US. Why should the US bear the brunt of every cost on the planet? The EU is rich, let them pay India and China to do fuckall. 
$C: So go find some instances of what you see as propaganda from the left, and bitch about it in that thread. You are literally trying to distract from the issue are you not? 
$C: Yeah, I mean it's really all worth checking out. Gathering just those links has taken some time as I've got to search back. I know of some others, but was having trouble finding them now. 

In closing, that's about all the energy I'm going to put into this comment, which just about nobody is going to see anyways, apart from maybe those of you who asked me to post it. Hope you understand.
$C: Keep ignoring the elephant in the room. 

I edited my original post btw.
$C: They absolutely do move goalposts. 

An example of that and more here: https://medium.com/@dave_pilmy/fact-check-5-staggering-logical-fallacies-committed-by-hillary-clinton-supporters-343b9a9f08e7
$C: And when pro Bernie post were being upvoted (they're still upvoted today as long as he doesn't criticize the DNC) it was legit, and those threads had pro Hillary and pro Trump people in them shitting on Bernie and supporters. Could some of them have been CTR and Trump trolls from 4chan or the farm? Probably. When things died down, I saw a lot of Bernie people go back to their Sanders subreddits. 
$C: >Uranium One has been debunked

You don't have a source you shill fuck lol
$C: > Uranium One has been debunked.

Holy shit lol!
$C: No i'm not confusing anything... I'm saying the government regulates what is and isn't an infringement of the bill of rights. They uphold the bill of rights as part of a social contract. We the people demanding for the government to uphold net neutrality as a part of our basic rights is  yes more regulation, but so is the entirety of our rights as a whole. And btw thats not what the 2nd amendment says, and cutting it short is doing a disservice to the original intent and meaning of the 2nd amendment. 

P.S. I'm from texas, I own a gun I'm not against the 2nd amendment, but I also understand that a fully automatic weapon is a terrible way to protect oneself. Buy a shotgun. 
$C: Section 8, food stamps, WICK, Medicare, Medicaid, affirmative action, etc etc etc are all government regulations. We can still bear arms and some of us with the qualifications can have automatic weapons and some of us without can still buy them see Vegas...

Maybe your the one confused.
$C: Gets the point across, doesn't it?
$C: Yes when you're on your altright garbage subs. 
$C: Your post has literally no redeeming value, and I can actually feel a headache coming on due to the sheer amount of brain cells I lost from reading it.
$C: Nice strawman there autismo supreme 
$C: **"No one should be stupid enough to believe it"** - ah, there's the clue.

You assert that when people were writing "THEY ARE STEALING THE INTERNET", it was clear to everyone they didn't mean that literally, and it was also clear to everyone they didn't mean anything by analogy pretty much like that.

You have no reasonable basis for this presumption. People are at vastly different levels of understanding. Your method allows any form of lie, simply by claiming "noone should be stupid enough to believe it".

By the way, you know that Obama raped a child when he lived in Chicago, right? 
$C: >https://medium.com/theyoungturks/comcast-spends-millions-in-lobbying-on-net-neutrality-without-their-news-networks-disclosing-their-499b3d9cb6dd

The Young Turks isn't a credible source. $4m is 1/20000th (one to twenty thousand) of Comcat's annual revenue. Actually an argument that it means very very little to them.

>http://bgr.com/2017/07/12/net-neutrality-explained-internet-day-of-action-july-12/

Literally states that they combine COMCAST contributions and COMCAST EMPLOYEE contributions, and that these tally up to an average of $6,345 in donations. Six thousand dollars. Clearly "incredibly hard" lobbying. Or rather, evidence of the complete opposite.

>https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15959932/comcast-verizon-att-net-neutrality-day-of-action

Doesn't separate out net neutrality-related lobbying from every other lobbying they do

>Or how about an example of when Comcast sent Cease and desist letters 

Not evidence of "incredibly hard lobbying", letters it takes someone in their legal department minutes to send.

Funnily, in trying to provide sources that they "lobby incredibly hard" to have it removed, you provide the complete opposite, evidence that it means virtually nothing to them. 

When annual revenue is $80bn, you would kind of expect them to spend more than $4m on something if they expected it to have a big impact on that revenue.
$C: Yep because I said that.
$C: No, I was telling you to fuck off when you said that I should suffer the consequences if I ever participate in a revolution of any sort.
$C: No
$C: Sound like? Odds are he is an edgy 13 year old. 
$C: No it’s not because that’s a good point, but you never made that point. 

I understand being worried about your ISP changing things but I believe that’s a short term bandaid that will hurt us in the long run and I hate government regulations because I was absolutely screwed by the Affordable Care Act, not just because of money but incompetence on the governments part. My wife was removed from our insurance twice for no reasons. We were left holding 20K in hospital bills because we had a letter in the mail when we got home from having a baby. Long story short- two years later I finally have it all cleared up. She was removed without cause and simply because the government was involved. 
$C: God* And we don’t need to be using that kind of language, I’m trying to gain religion neutrality over here.
$C: K
$C: Don’t forget red states give considerably more to charity than blue states.
$C: Well I'm sure you know the old saying ""ignorance is bliss""
I'm sure it has something to do with that.
$C: If electric companies could figure out which watts power the refrigerator and which power the electric toothbrush, I'd be fine for not having electricity neutrality.
$C: > . If you weren't embraced there or on reddit that doesn't mean they have a monopoly.

I was "censored" not "not embraced."

> Reddit stopped tolerating the more uncouth subreddits quite some time ago. People didn't like it, but they're within their rights as a private enterprise.

Then they should lose common-carrier status, agreed?
$C: If private companies can censor me, then why can't other private companies determine how people use their services? They're individual companies.
$C: Except Ellen Pao and spez himself have admitted it broke no rules, so can you please try again?
$C: Doing what? Mocking a ranty young teen?
$C: You're not reading my comment because you revel in being misinformed and crying your eyes out all over Reddit with childish, thoughtless, pathetic one-liners because you don't even know what you're arguing in favor of.

Not even reading the nn rules is good proof of that

$C: Actually, it does work: http://blogs.lexisnexis.co.uk/dr/can-wasted-time-be-claimed-as-damages/

$C: Spoken like a true white racist.
$C: Media matters shill obsessed with penis. Seems normal
$C: I pay Comcast, I can stop paying Comcast if I want to. Google is still going to push their products eat up bandwidth, and Facebook is still going to push its bullshit fake news, and twitter is still going to ban people for disagreeing with Jack. I can't control those actions, but I *can* stop paying Comcast if they try and screw me over. 

There is very little to lose if Google or Netflix has to pay the ISPs to push a quality product, if anything that makes my bills cheaper in the long run, especially if they start divvying it up. 

I can't wait for this NN to finally die. Its going to be a glorious day. But the fight is not over yet, there are still millions of shills that want to do google, and facebooks bidding. Its going to be a tough fight, but hopefully the right side will emerge! I already called my congressman and asked him to make sure these restrictions go away.
$C: > who don't understand why google fiber just kind of fizzled out

Because they tried to lay their cables, which required putting them next to existing cables, and the existing quasi-monopolies went to court screaming "*THEY'RE TOUCHING OUT STUFF THEY CAN'T TOUCH OUR STUFF PLEASE MAKE THEM STOP TOUCHING OUT STUFF!*"

Google gave up on it because it just wasn't worth it.

What do you think startup ISPs who don't have the basically infinite pile of money from Alphabet behind them will do? Grow naturally into a free market without being driven out of business by the "big 4"?

If so... I've got a bridge to sell you.
$C: I don't understand these people at all.
$C: right. say that to the couple hundred g's in the bank and my 3k+ customers. lol but i'm a "random paid shill". good talk. 
$C: Because youre too lazy to either read the ToS or too lazy to do anything about it except keep shilling. Nobody made you pick that job. You did that to yourself.
$C: Thats how boycotting works. You make the sacrifice and the market responds to counter that sacrifice. Otherwise you are as complicit as a soldier of the SS. Your reasons are literally entitlement based. 
$C: Democrats do the exact same thing under the premise of being anti free market. Either way youre bias in your logic. Lobbyists exist in every industry. Even the marijuana industry. Not every lobbyist is evil, however if youre going to give regulation power to the Government you should probably do so without Lobbyists writing that regulation. You’re plan favors the biggest Monopolies. Because once they leave Comcast or Verizon they will just buy the Regulators to help grow their investments. 
$C: Sure it is. Comcast can't control the internet if you can get internet without their influence same day. Just because you don't want to switch doesn't mean they're forcing you to use their service.
$C: Did you watch the video?
Set aside your preconceived notions that the internet is gonna die. You say I "just watch right wing shit" when everyday I see pro NN all over this website. 
Please watch the video with an open mind. You might learn something. 

The issue with any political debate is emotion. Clear your mind, think about it logically. 
$C: And yet he chose a Republican with a serious interest in repealing Net Neutrality.

$C: This is great news for the other side, though.

$C: Maybe he can be convinced to vote for someone else next time. There's always hope.

$C: I disagree, downdoot
$C: Nah we had it figured out, just had to continually regulate as ISPs overstepped their bounds. I like my internet open and unthrottled, thank you. 

Also, if you don't know much, don't make inflammatory comments. 
$C: If you haven't noticed, when corporations can do whatever they want, it isn't good for anyone but shareholders. It was to prevent them from screwing everyone before they could get away with it. Go troll somewhere else.
$C: Infrastructure takes several decades to build. NN takes a day to repeal. 

If you want to repeal NN, wait for the infrastructure to be built so competitors, true competitors, not oligopolies, can exist. You just agreed with a law repeal hugely in favor of railroads before trucks exist, under the claim “well they won’t be a monopoly SOMEDAY, so let them fuck over whoever they want.”

The internet works just fine as is, and doesn’t need destroyed. How we access it is the issue. 

How we access it will not change until technology catches up. 
$C: By net neutrality. That’s how. And that’s been repealed. So now they’re not stopping them from fucking me over whatsoever. 

Go reread what I said. 

Previously, NN prevented monopolistic market conditions. Now it doesn’t. 
$C: I truly don't think you understand the world. I'm not going to work myself up over this. Goodbye, and may you learn how the world works eventually

$C: So.. it gives people the right. To find him in the street and attack him. Please give them more fuel to win. Make us look like extremist willing to do anything even physically harm people to get our way.
$C: Lmfao. I can't even comprehend what goes through your head. Are you the type of person that solves everything through violence? 
$C: But they don't actually do those things they talk about, even the ones that could possibly sound appealing. For example, this tax bill will raise the debt by trillions. Cutting taxes for the middle class? Only if you make 75k or above and only for a temporary amount of time, if you're not crazy rich, then they're set to rise again.

Democrats do a few underhanded things. Obviously it's good the ones who sexually harassed got called out for it, and the DNC's bias during the primaries polarized progressives way too much. Personally, I was for Bernie until the general election and was as mad as any of them. But they didn't try to elect a known (alleged) statutory rapist for senator or collude with a foreign power that's a known enemy. And policy wise they've generally been trying to help people instead of divide them.
$C: Says the person who just painted all Republicans worse. What a fucking hypocrite. Have you considered running for President?
$C: Fair enough. Poor wording on my part. I meant we are not a true democracy, and what i mean is the mob rule type of democracy. We elect people to represent us and we have a constitution in place to limit the power of our govt. thats what i see as democracy. I just used the first term that came to mind, even though they are almost identical. 
$C: Oh, in the meantime, I came up with something else:

Tactic: Form a non-governmental organization to use collective bargaining power to make it too costly for ISPs to bother to fuck over their customers' internet connections.

Instead of paying Comcast, you pay the organization and they pay your bill and deal with Comcast for you.

If you don't like the job the organization is doing, you quit them and pay Comcast directly.

If you do like the job the organization is doing, you stick with them.

The organization would be able to negotiate the fine print to ensure that "Net Neutrality" are included in the terms. The new 2017 rules do allow the FTC to go after the ISPs if they lie about their service, so there would be a method of enforcement.

Thoughts?
$C: Do you know that? It's all about marketing and psychology. If you shoot down an idea before presenting it to people, then of course there probably won't be enough people... because they haven't heard the idea. Nay-sayers are more of a problem in radical movements than the system they'd like to overthrow.
$C: You are a sad fucking bunch of people. You all deserve what you are going to get, you entitled fucking children.
$C: Enjoy nothing changing and the government continuously fucking you deeper and deeper in the ass while you look over your shoulder with your pinky in your mouth and ask "can you listen to me *now* please?  No? Okay..." and then continue to get fucked.
$C: This response was barely coherent.  Cited a bad thing you did.
$C: Hmmm. Being on the internet requires me to be neutral? Oh, hold up, that's not how anything works! 

Hey, you tried. I'd give you a gold star, but uh... it'd probably be bad form, at this point. 

Pst, before you lose your mind, kindergartens all over the place use stickers, including gold stars, as a reward for things - like effort. It's called a joke, a word whose definition can be found by googling! But, better watch out... all those librul fascists controlled by Soros from his Child Pizza Dungeon using microwave listening devices love to post fake news - that might mean definitions too.

$C: India has NN.

INDIA. The country that blew funding to stop their people from starving in the streets on a space program that's never getting anywhere, is smart enough to have Net Neutrality.
$C: Not yet.  ;)
$C: If they try to unperson their competitors or critics, there's still unfair trade practices to go after them with. At least for now....
$C: Correct.  $1,800 a month is hyperbole, but their ability to do that if they decided to even right this second is very real.
$C: Sure it is. There's a shared infrastructure. It's far cheaper to add customer 1000 than it is to add customer 1.
$C: **Net neutrality**

Net neutrality is the principle that Internet service providers must treat all data on the Internet the same, and not discriminate or charge differently by user, content, website, platform, application, type of attached equipment, or method of communication. For instance, under these principles, internet service providers are unable to intentionally block, slow down or charge money for specific websites and online content.

The term was coined by Columbia University media law professor Tim Wu in 2003, as an extension of the longstanding concept of a common carrier, which was used to describe the role of telephone systems.

A widely cited example of a violation of net neutrality principles was the Internet service provider Comcast's secret slowing ("throttling") of uploads from peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P) applications by using forged packets.

>No, the reason smaller coffee shops don't exist near starbucks (which is not really true, but ok) is because starbucks offers a huge variety of good tasting coffee, with the speed and efficiency of a large company. Predatory pricing is a boogeyman that basically never exists, because it doesn't make sense. So comcast sees that there is competition in one of their areas. They then drop their prices for some undetermined amount of time and hopes the other company goes out of business. They're losing money while doing this. The point is that once there are no competitors, they can just jack up the prices to make up for all of that loss. The problem with your logic is that a) there actually IS some competition among ISPs, otherwise your internet bill would be some arbitrarily huge amount, which it isn't. and b) once their competition goes out of business and they jack the prices up, another company could crop up and take their business again, and then comcast would have to do the whole process over again. It makes no sense.

It does make sense.
Local new small ISPs can not offer country-wide service at all, if they will ever exist in the first place. As said, it costs a lot of initial investment to even set up a network locally, let alone provide country-wide coverage. Google did it, or tried to, but google is a massive company already, making their profits from other things. I do think that the local laws preventing further expansion were ridiculous, but I also think that the other ISPs had a hand in that as well.
So for a small start-up ISP, the only way of competing is provide a cheaper service locally, then grow and expand from there.
Meanwhile, big ISPs like Comcast or Verizon notices that in this area, there is a competitor. What they can do, is reduce the prices in this area ONLY to undercut the price of that competitor. This costs them a bit of money, but hey, losing customers to a competitor who then may grow bigger is a worse problem, so the goal is to eliminate competition. Either you keep the customers but they pay a little bit less... or you lose the customers and they will pay nothing at all. This is a good aggressive market domination strategy that works, and has been proven to work.  
They could also choose to slightly increase prices in an area where there are no other competitors, to offset their losses for undercutting a competitor in a different area. Considering that internet is pretty much mandatory in today's age, people in that place can not choose not to have it, so they'll pay the higher price because they have literally no other choice or else become handicapped.
This means that the only viable way of even beginning to compete, is to build a massive network immediately, everywhere, or hope that you get hundreds if not thousands of small ISP startups everywhere at once, making it unlikely that bigger ISPs can undercut the prices everywhere at once.
The only reason why comcast and verizon and at&t can compete (yet also make backroom price deals to prevent too much competition to the point of losing money), is because they are all big and all have coverage everywhere already. They are established and want to maintain that.

It is so unlikely this will change anytime soon. If anything the loss of NN made it less likely that it will change. By all means I do hope that, in the case of Net Neutrality being lost permanently, new companies will pop up and do the right thing and keep themselves to the Net Neutrality standard without needing a watchdog to force them to keep them to it. We already know that your big ISPs will not do that, however.


> By extort I assume you mean "charge". Yes, ISPs will charge other companies to use their infrastructure. Not sure what's weird about that.

Nothing weird about that, no.
I meant other, smaller ISPs. Because it already means that smaller ISPs can not provide a cheaper service than their "host" ISP from which they rent the infrastructure to provide a country wide coverage. This, in effect, means that we will indeed get separate versions of the internet, because it will start to use different networks. 
ISPs already charge smaller companies for accessing their network, but do not treat them differently than other consumers. 
With the loss of Net Neutrality they can also charge these small startups more BECAUSE it is a small company and internet is absolutely necessary to grow in today's age.

> Are you joking? You're on reddit. This is probably legitimately one of the worst places you can visit if you don't want to have your information or news curated for you.

I am on reddit, yes. Not my main source of news though, I'm more here for the gaming subreddits and writing communities. Don't judge me.  
But, let's say I'm someone who watches a lot of news.  
If I want, I could go to CNN for my news. Or FOX News. Or MSNBC. Literally anything. It's up to ME to decide that. I can just type in the address and go there.
Once an ISP decides they disagree with a certain media source or whatever, they can now block it from their consumers. For example, because MSNBC reported on the many protests against Verizon, and Verizon noticed a steep decline in their consumer base after news got out about those protests, Verizon now decides that MSNBC is negatively affecting their consumer base, and blocks it. They can even do it smarter and not block MSNBC as a website, but rather, certain links with keywords like "Verizon" and "protests". So that consumers are unaware that specific content is being blocked from them.

And what about the actual news media? Where do you think they get some news from, and then spread it? Phonecalls? Snail mail? Some of it, sure. But a lot of it also happens over the internet. E-mails, other news media they use as sources, etc.
ISPs can filter out e-mails from specific sources, prevent them from even arriving at the destination. They can filter out foreign news sources.
In other words, perhaps they do not even NEED to filter out content from consumers, rather, they'll affect the news sources directly to prevent it from ever getting public in the first place.

Possible? Yes. Legal? Yeah. Likely? We'll see. If it happens, I doubt you will hear about it though, because it will get filtered out one way or another.

> I find it equal parts hilarious and pathetic how people on reddit desperately try to make the case that certain industries somehow don't work in a free market, when the reality is you have a natural proclivity towards controlling markets through government regulation, and you're looking for any excuse to do so. Laying infrastructure for the internet is a costly business, but it's not astronomically expensive. There are many industries that require huge upfront costs that still operate in a free market. The facility to create high power processors cost in the billions of dollars. Laying some fiber in a densely populated urban area and then growing from there is not some insurmountable problem for the free market. We know that this is not a problem with the free market, because google has tried to break into the market, and they were halted due to local regulations. This also nullifies your contrived argument about predatory pricing, because google would be able to outlast comcast if a price war even happened, which it wouldn't.

Is your water supply, gas supply, electrical supply, also all unregulated and on a free market basis? It is not.
Would it be a good thing if it was? Or would the population health be at risk by some water service provider cutting corners on their water filtration system to get a better profit margin? Would hospitals be at risk of a power outage if some electrical company decided to cut corners and not provide a basic overflow of the energy net to account for power demand fluctuations? Would homes in the north be at risk of freezing over if a gas company decided it was a good idea to change the composition of their gas and provide less efficiency for heating but is far cheaper?

The government doesn't need to control a market and prevent competition. It does need to regulate and set specific laws so that the people are not at risk of being screwed by corporations who only care about profits and market domination (which is the entire goal of corporations). 
This is not a difficult concept, nor is it something outrageous to expect.
Net Neutrality is such a regulation to protect the people *just in case* the corporations decide to cut corners.
Does that automatically mean that the government is evil and actively trying to reduce corporate profits? I don't think so. Upholding and demanding a certain guaranteed quality is not punishing corporations unless it is a ridiculous quality that needs to be upheld. And so far, I have not yet seen arguments why Net Neutrality is so ridiculous.

Maybe some of the rules and regulations needed to be loosened, sure. But this is cutting the entire forest down to get rid of one rotting tree, which was pointed out by a lumbermill company who originally was not allowed to cut ANY tree because it was protected.
$C: So tell me how having two choices in every major city is an open market. The corporations are the ones enforcing this situation not the government. I can't even have access to Google fiber because of local governments siding with the isp companies despite Denver having an alarmingly high number of people in support of it. Freedom to choose is not freedom if the choices are already made for me.
$C: "doesn't harm anyone" it baffles that you believe in 2017 that having basic internet isn't essential to basic life in a vast majority of peoples lives. College students, self employed workers, any company that uses the internet for business(plot twist almost all of them). Without net neutrality these big monopoly companies can force you to pay more for everything you do and forcefully feed messages of their own agenda. Like Time warner, like getting your news from somewhere else besides CNN? Well with net neutrality it is legal for time warner to make it impossible to get it from elsewhere. Sounds a awfully lot like North Korea. Sure you can say "oh new companies can pop up" but when has that ever worked when has the big monopoly company not crushed the smaller ones? 
$C: >There's potential for organization there. But you harping on an issue which has literally died in the water, bitching about how no one did anything despite the fact that it's waaay out of all the major news cycles, is doing fuck-all.

The sentiment isn't a call for inaction. It is a statement of realism that shows an understanding of the pattern and current climate of the voters.

No one said that we shouldn't do anything, it is the cynical realism that the likelihood that the people get what they are fighting for fails until we have a new election.

Just because I think that there is a slim chance of something great happening, doesn't mean I don't want that great thing to happen, and won't do what I can to try and make it happen.

Yes, but tell me, if they're charging the supply end, it's in their best interest to charge less for the demand end... Because more users = more they can charge the supply end

>Prices can ONLY go up as a result of this

Except, you know, supply and demand says otherwise. They want as many people on the demand side as possible, therefor will charge less if they can charge more for supply side.


Which will in turn (slowly) turn into charging very little for internet (or even free) and then paying a tiny bit more for things like netflix, hulu, etc, bandwidth heavy applications

If you're a business charging companies access to customers, it's directly your best interest to have as many customers as possible

The lies on Reddit are reaching propaganda levels. Why is Reddit unable to push "liberalism" without lying?
$C: I agree I worded it incorrectly, it should have just been "over net neutrality" if it were something more severe however, only if not achievable anyway else should killing for said policies be considered okay.
$C: I'm sure that's what ISIS, Al Qaeda, Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, and Mao Ze Dong thought too, think about what you're saying, are they really the sociopaths if you're all suggesting BOMBING a vote to get your way? I don't agree with the FCC at all, but why the actual fuck is everyone's answer to disagreement fucking bombing? The more and more people suggest this, the more and more they sound like actual terrorists. Nowhere did I say ignore it either, I said to do it peacefully without BOMBING, if you read the post, it's almost certain that this will be brought to court and net neutrality reinstated.
$C: No, but turns out Time Warner has the same understanding of anatomy as Tommy Wiseau 
$C: I know that but some 80 year old dude who calls black people the n word and complains about "those damn commies" probably wouldnt see it that way lol
$C: The FCC been handling a lot of it since 2000ish, and the FTC is over burdened, they even mentioned in during the voting, FTC  will enforce antitrust and privacy, not fast lanes and prioritization, since it doesn't hurt competition between internet providers which is what most people have issue with I think
$C: Oh, gotcha. So it just wasn't in the right place. That was the problem. The thousands of people just have to be in the right spot, and *then* our elected government will represent the interests of the many over the few. Come on, dude.

The police caught wind of the protests and set up places where they would "allow" protesters to protest. The original, chosen locations were fenced off by the authorities. The police kept the protesters exactly where they wanted them: out of the way.

Protesting is no longer effective,.
$C: We used to have one.  But it was worn down to nothing.  The plutocracy played the long, slow game.
$C: No, tyranny has a specific definition in modern times, and that is when you can't remove your government through well established, peaceful means. One decision of the executive branch isn't tyranny, because you can vote out every single representative  who confirmed the FCC members, you get to vote the POTUS who nominated them out if you don't like him, etc. In short, you do have the power to change things. The only reason why you failed is because not enough people, who share the same power as you do, didn't care enough. Which is also their right.

And if you wanna go super worst case you could use dial up or cellular internet. The point is you could cancel if you had to and still be able to access the Internet well enough to complete school work or work work. You may not be playing video games but you don’t need that in an emergency.

Whatever you leave on the wall we will consider as art, and hang it in a museum for all the world to see and cheer over. 


$C: I mean, yes the repeal of net neutrality in the US will be a pretty crappy thing. But if you look at the historical conditions that predated past revolutions, they were *much* worse. And that was back when governments *didn't* have access to weapons orders of magnitude more advanced than a citizen would be allowed to/could afford to own.

Only way a revolution is happening here, like you said, is if it's a literal apocalypse scenario and most people have been without basic necessities for a few days. 

$C: Correct, but still, if you screw customers over only marginally less than the other guys, you won't get many converts because it's hardly worth the effort. Screwing over your customers a lot less gets you the big bucks. Sounds like you should just switch to cell
$C: When it comes to "The Issues" Net Neutrality and an Open Internet will always be at the forefront for me, so long as I work and operate here. Above tax reform, healthcare, gun control, and all those other hot button issues.

Now obviously if the candidate is a proven absolute piece of shit, I'm not going to vote for them. But in the more common scenario that both candidates are semi-decent human beings who might just have a couple mistakes on their belt and nothing criminal or completely immoral, I'm going to side with the Pro-Net Neutrality candidate every time.

$C: Ahh, I see where I misread. Here's what I'd seen on it:
>Between 2007 and 2011, Pai held several positions in the FCC's Office of General Counsel, serving most prominently as Deputy General Counsel. In this role, he had supervisory responsibility over several dozen lawyers in the Administrative Law Division and worked on a wide variety of regulatory and transactional matters involving the wireless, wireline, cable, Internet, media, and satellite industries.[1] In 2010, Pai was one of 55 individuals nationwide chosen for the 2011 Marshall Memorial Fellowship, a leadership development initiative of the German Marshall Fund of the United States.[1] Pai returned to the private sector in April 2011, working in the Washington, D.C., office of law firm Jenner & Block where he was a partner in the Communications Practice. 

>In 2011, Pai was then nominated for a Republican Party position on the Federal Communications Commission by President Barack Obama at the recommendation of Minority leader Mitch McConnell. He was confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate on May 7, 2012, and was sworn in on May 14, 2012, for a term that concluded on June 30, 2016.[1] Then Pai was designated chairman of the FCC by President Donald Trump in January 2017 for a five-year term.[16] He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate for the additional five-year term on October 2, 2017

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajit_Pai

I didn't see the part where he returned to the private sector for a year from 2011-2012. He served in the FCC from 2007 to 2011, and then left, only to return to serve as a Commissioner in 2012 when Obama nominated him on McConnell's recommendation.

$C: Dude, you're commenting in a thread on net neutrality and have no fucking clue what just even happened. It's like you're allergic to actual facts. Goodbye indeed. 
$C: >But net neutrality at least prevents my only option from gouging me, throttling me, preventing me from seeing/loading/playing etc...

There are plenty of people whose only ISP option DOES gouge them with price and poor service right now. ISPs like Comcast have been consistently terrible with or without net neutrality. 

Your conjecture is as good as mine on the future so I'll make some conjecture. If ISPs can make fast lanes and site packages, those could fit very well with certain users and the users could pay even less to get only the exact sort of internet they want. So that's a possibility. It'd be just like cable TV. A possibility.
$C: Yes please
$C: It’s almost like I elect senators and a representative from my state to represent me at the federal level...and that *still* isn’t working.


I trust my state level politicians less than my federal politicians, and my local politicians even less than both of the former.
$C: So what you’re proposing is we delegate the authority of an international, advanced technological system to individual states.


I wonder if a situation like this has happened before? If it has, there’s no way it went so poorly that we had to pass an Act to specifically let the Federal Government step in and fix things.

$C: >So you blame your parents for not liking your life. Good work. There are ways to exist in this world that justify the cost of living in it. It's your responsibility to find what that is.

I mean ... it's not like they didn't cause my existence which included a chance for me to not like life, right?

>It's not even an argument, it's casual shaming. You should realize that you are the first generation to put away their reproductive rights because some internet idiots said it was a good idea.

Casual shaming huh? 
Oh I still have the capability to reproduce. It's a fucking natural RIGHT. I don't **have to** use it. It's not just some internet idiot telling me to not do it. I had this mindset way before finding people who agreed. So maybe you should call me the idiot?

And if there is a need to find something that makes life worth living, shouldn't parents have the responsibility to provide that to their children? Should you have children if you can't guarantee they'll find this goal?

>The Christians believe suffering builds character. Neitschze talks about suffering being necessary in life. The whole argument that suffering is a negative is the crux of this issue (like I keep poking at) and if you have an understanding of the world that can see positivity in suffering, then the whole argument falls apart.

I see a point in suffering if this suffering can prevent even more suffering. We can agree on something here: some suffering can be necessary, even beneficial.

Here's where we disagree:

 I don't see life itself as a necessity when the default state is "non-existence" instead of being biased by our desires influenced by evolution.

>The quickest route to ending your own suffering and those you love is to shoot them in their sleep, they would feel nothing. Then kill yourself. You have just saved them X decades of suffering. If that's what you care about, there is logically no better way to accomplish your goals.

Not necessarily. First of all, that would require a gun, and the ability to have access to everyone I care about while they sleep in a span of time short enough to be able to finish the job and kill myself before getting arrested.

Assuming I could succeed, all those deaths could cause a lot of grief to other people who cared about them, relied on them.

I don't think it's a reasonable solution. Way too messy. It would hurt tons of people.
And humanity would keep going, and so would animal life. I care about suffering in general. My death would affect people who love me, but it doesn't mean I don't give a shit about the suffering of people who don't even know me.

However, if given the perfect solution, like a red button killing everything instantly and painlessly, then sure I would pick this option with much less hesitation. Give me some credit here, at least this is consistent with my position.

It would kill you too. But really, there's no downside. You wouldn't even see it coming. No suffering. No regrets.


Edit: grammar
$C: That's not even what you said. You said guns are in the hands of people who don't want net neutrality which is not true.
$C: It seems to me you misread the intention of his reply. No need to be so aggressive
$C: Why don't you Google your own claims. Pew research shows that 44% of Republicans claim they own a gun. 20% of Democrats claim they do. That's hardly *almost all*.

[Here](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/22/key-takeaways-on-americans-views-of-guns-and-gun-ownership/)
$C: I find that hard to believe. 330 million + guns and 330 million citizens, only 1/4 are gun owners?  Even people I know that don't like guns own them. I'm in GA, so maybe that's just the way it is. 

Edit: I feel the need to clarify here, I grew up in the south and grew up around guns. Most of the people I knew/know are gun owners. I didn't think everyone owned a gun, I just thought that it was most Americans. 
$C: >Since Net Neutrality, as it exists today, is a government regulation, its being pitched by Republicans as a reduction of government interference. But from where I'm sitting, it seems blatantly anti-consumer, pro-big business, which would explain why these big businesses are spending so much money on politicians.

huh, interesting, thank you for this. I found it interesting that NBC Nightly News opened up with this story, and blatently stated that their parent company (comcast) supported the bill, good on them for being open.

They also mentioned that the big cable companies announced that this new ruling will have no affect on their internet plans. So I'm wondering why say that; is it a lie? If not, why pay all that lobbying to not change anything?
$C: Hey you're preaching to the choir here man. I live in a full dem state but EXCUSE ME if I don't want to condemn all people with republican views because they aren't being represented properly. 
$C: What?
$C: Thanks, it does help to know. I see some of my friends who are successful and I'm happy for them of course but sometimes I feel like a loser. But I can count on one hand the people that are successful AND working in their field/like what they do. No one wins. The whole "follow your dreams" things was bullshit. 
$C: I didn't assume anything. Those were suggestions if you're struggling to make ends meet due to high cost of living. It doesn't fucking matter who you are, you can always work harder.
$C: Travel and perspective don't demand wealth or great distance though... Getting off facebook and reddit for a week and taking a long weekend to go on a little road trip to a neighboring state will do wonders.

$C: Did you read the last couple lines of my original message.  I recently lost a friend of mine talking exactly like OP.  I would have much preferred he take off and at least try to live than stay put, change nothing, and not. 
$C: > Unless you're playing the long game and thinking that you'd rather the system gets even more terrible now in the hope that we can have single payer in the future.

Yup, that. Ultimately I want single payer because healthcare does not obey the normal laws of the free market. It sucks that people will pay more for healthcare, but better they know the true cost of healthcare while denying insurance companies a cushy seat at a taxpayer-funded buffet. I would rather go without insurance (and I do) than continue to support this shitty system.
$C: Whoever doesn't think a biased source of information is a good source.... is a pizzagater?

$C: That premiums skyrocketed and choices PLUMMETED under the ACA?

I mean that easily-provable fact is what you're ignoring, sport
$C: Right, your black and white "one or the other" argument that splits people even if they agree on issues, kind of like this. 
$C: But Obama didn't veto it. And what about the senate? 

And not to mention there's more than one bill associated with the US actions in Syria. 

My whole point is that the parties don't really matter, so the fact they're evenly split doesn't surprise me. Just as long as it passes, they can divide up the useless remaining "nay" votes however is the most politically convenient for whatever stance their party is taking at the moment.
$C: “Won this” I never said that ? but if we’re counting I did trigger a few of you and I’m still here laughing my ass off at all the net neutrality shill soyboys. And for that post I could honestly care less, report me.

$C: >NN doesn't regulate what they can charge now.

Yes they do. The principle is that Internet Service Providers can't charge one company more than another under particular circumstances.

> Why would they need to calculate prices more effectively if they have no competition in any given region, or sufficiently little competition they can simply pick the same high prices without fear of being undercut?

This is objectively wrong. Most people have [more than one choice](http://esa.doc.gov/sites/default/files/competition-among-us-broadband-service-providers.pdf), and there are many substitutes to direct cable connections.

>All ISPs already do this.

Oops. I meant bandwidth usage. This is common for cell phone carriers, but not common elsewhere.

>In what way does NN prevent that?

See [this article](https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/2008-winter/net-neutrality/).

>For instance, in order not to “unfairly discriminate” against movie downloads, Comcast may also slow down other types of data transfers for which speed is essential. Certain “real-time” applications such as streaming video (e.g., YouTube), telephony services (e.g., Skype), and multi-player gaming require that data packets stream smoothly without interruption. In order for these applications to stream smoothly, and therefore function as intended, an ISP might give their data packets priority over those of movie downloads or email, for which smooth streaming is not essential.

>It's not the case that regulation is never appropriate and good

Yes it is, but nevertheless it is certainly bad in this situation, as I've argued.
$C: Google does not control access to my website.
$C: That doesn't make me a hypocrite, it means I can read.

The issues with ISPs being able to restrict access to content is their Monopoly status in most markets. I have one ISP option. You have unlimited choices that aren't reddit.

$C: What the hell does that have to do with Republicans consistent position on killing NN vs Democrats protecting it? 

I'm not ignorant to corporate interests in government. I'm a fan of Chomsky. But even he says "[the Republican party is the most dangerous organization in human history](http://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-39879374/chomsky-republican-party-most-dangerous-organisation-on-earth)". Get outta here with your *equivocation. 
$C: > Do you not understand? Obama appointed Pai. Obama reclassified the internet stripping it of the protections it had under the law (1996 telecommunications act - the thing SOPA/PIPA tried to undo, DO YOU EVEN REMEMBER?).

I can't tell if you're trying to paint Title II reclassification as bad for consumers here, because you'd be wrong, that's what allows the FCC to enforce Net Neutrality.

Not to mention the only reason that the FCC had to do that was because Verizon won a court case in 2014 where the courts struck down the existing regulations that protected Net Neutrality.

Maybe you should do some research before claiming both sides are the same when their actions are completely polar opposites.
$C: What in the fuck are you saying? Literally, what the fuck? You literally just tossed around a shit ton of word salad and topped it off by conflating multiple issues into one issue. Then you finished by arrogantly pretending to be non-partisan, despite this posts one-sided attack on Democrats. 

You seriously have to elaborate on what you mean when you throw around all these talking points without explanation and say, "SEE, GOT YA!" I want you to explain to me in detail what you think Title ll is and how it effected the internet negatively. Also, while you are describing these things tell me more about Tom Wheelers forbearance regulations and how they were "about to become laws."

To be clear, I am not asking you to describe these issues to me because I do not know what they are. I know very well what they are, I am asking you because you have clearly displayed that you do **not** properly understand these issues. I want you to tell me so I can point directly at your error and describe how it is an error. You don't just get to say, "TELECOM ACT, TITLE ll, LOBBYING, I DONT CARE IF YOUR A DEM OR A REP I *SWEAR*! SEE! POINT PROVEN I'M RIGHT!"

$C: >Is that why black americans in solid blue cities have fared significantly worse than in purple districts?

They don't. All Americans, of all backgrounds, on average fare batter in blue states and have higher levels of income.

>Protip: if you can't threaten the folks who represent you by voting the alternative, they won't ever prioritize your needs.

Why would you "threaten" someone who fairly represents you by voting for someone who wants you dead?

>Unions are not a liberal thing.

Yes they are. Labour unions are a fundamentally left-wing philosophy which is why all modern conservative politicians and conservative parties oppose them.

>I don't see a 'party of the people', nor do I want a party of the people.

Just because you're willfully blind to something doesn't change what it is. Democrats are the ones who actually look out for the common American, and this is something that is readily quantifiable based on the last 20 years of congress voting records.

No they haven't. I save money just fine. You're [drunk on propaganda from the conservative media](https://www.autostraddle.com/this-is-how-fox-news-brainwashes-its-viewers-our-in-depth-investigation-of-the-propaganda-cycle-297107/). 

>That's why everything is a handout/entitlement that's paid third party or on cards that reload monthly and no cash is actually given. If blacks could save, they'd stray from the party because they wouldn't economically depend on democrats. 

This is a thoroughly debunked but common racially charged false talking point commonly heard on the conservative media, far-right blogs, and etc cetera. Less than 1 in 10 black people are on any form of welfare. Black people don't "like" or "aspire" for "welfare" and it has nothing to do with their voting patterns, you moron. Stuff like shelters and food programs are basic components of functional society that all civilized nations have in the same way we have police, the fire department, and drinking water regulations.

And if anyone is relying on "handouts" (according to your logic), by sheer number, it is white Republicans. White Republicans consume the most welfare dollars in the country by far. Especially when it comes to the elderly.

>Or are you unaware of the fracture of the black upper-middle class that's increasingly becoming independent?

Not happening. In the recent Alabama senate election, for example, Doug Jones got 98% of the black female vote and 92% of the black male vote.

>But go on about how democrats are this holy party that is 'so much better'. Because from where I stand, being shitty and terrible vs. being shitty and slightly less terrible is still shitty and terrible.

[Here is a lengthy list of Congress voting patterns](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2pwhvt/the_differences_between_the_democratic_party_and/). Comb through this and tell me what is it about the about the legislation that Democrats support that is shitty and terrible. You won't do it, because you're not ready to challenge your thoughts or think critically. You're hear to parrot the latest debunked talking point you read on some conservative blog.

$C: I personally believe that net neutrality was just a power move for democrats. It was the solution to a problem we don’t and never have had. (Excuse weird grammar) It is obviously working. Besides Verizon that ONE time, when has a company ever done anything like that? Net neutrality is a scummy thing, only meant to turn the tides against the republicans when they repeal a useless act that was never needed. NN throttles competition among the existing ISP tycoons (as seen by a 6% decrease in spending among companies towards service development and improvement) and stifles competition. The amount of misinformation about net neutrality is horrifying, showing how all you need to sway public opinion is to sensationalize an issue and play to people’s emotions instead of the facts. “hey you, you’re going to have to pay money to use the internet unless you go against those dirty republicans!” Now, I just want to say I don’t lock myself to one specific party, but I def side with the ‘publicans on this one.
$C: "Sorry guys, we're gonna have to stop people being able to use water to flush their toilets today. We don't have enough water because we didn't invest in any more infrastructure this year. It's ok, you can purchase our Toilet packet for usage though."

"Sorry guys, we're gonna have to stop people being able to use electricity for their lights today. We don't have enough electricity because we didn't invest in any more infrastructure this year. It's ok, you can purchase our Light bulb packet for usage though."

"Sorry, you've gone over your sink water usage for this month. Pay £50 extra to use your sink again".


That's ok too?

$C: I'm not confusing intent with results. Regulations exist to control megacorporations, and what's what they do as well. Net neutrality is only a problem to ISPs that have monopolies and want to do things like throttle traffic and censor web content knowing consumers can't do anything about it.

$C: netneutrality is nothing to do freemarket. it even encourages start up companies.

I come from a country where we have always had NN  ,  i vould pay 10$  to get pretty fast internet with no data cap which can ccess ALL THE WEBSITES AND SERVICES  with the spwed i bought! I pah currently 29$ for 100mbs connection.

without NN, ISP can charge you extra on each different website you visit. Too bad fox news website is not included in social media package, pay 9,99$ more!

New company launches a web service? ISP can blackmail them to give them any money theh want , otherwisee  ISP will slow down the connection of all thwir customers to that said service. SOUNDS FAIR?  So free market

Luckily i am not US citizen, i can laugh from vwre with NN, good quality internet infastructure and fast cheap internet connwction.

In response to


>Can someone tell me ONE legitimate reason they think this is the case?

You told me you couldn't care less about the discussion of Net Neutrality so I went back to the fact that you claimed I have no idea about the opposing arguments when I had knowledge of several retarded ""arguments"" and asked for one valid reason. But sure, I backpedaled.

>go along with whatever the rest of reddit was """organically""" pushing to the front page.

Yeah, organically. Unlike a certain subreddit who stickied certain posts that was on their agenda to push it to /r/all essentially abusing the system and then complaining about censorship when the system was modified to not allow it.

I don't think you can reasonably pretend that Twitter's rules are impartial or nonbiased. The idea that Milo violated some rule on "harassment" by criticizing a movie star is utterly ridiculous. You do a poor job defending net neutrality when you make it so obvious that you hate freedom of speech. Why do *you* support net neutrality?
$C: How about /r/PunchANazi/ then? 

FPH never called for violence.
$C: SRS was a hate group since before Donald Trump was a political figure. BTW if "net neutrality" doesn't include neutrality for "hate groups", then it's not net neutrality, just net political correctness.
$C: That's kind of disingenuous though isn't it? In a thread with thousands of comments it would be impossible to read them all. The chances of seeing heavily down voted comments in an echo chamber is what creates the echo chamber. The very fact that you can go against the grain doesn't mean that it isn't an echo chamber. 
$C: So net neutrality doesn't apply to nationalists? Interesting.
$C: The chair of the FCC literally had his family threatened with actionable terrorist threats coming from your side. Please don't pretend criticism is "harassment" or that you care about basic human decency.
$C: That nigger literally told people to go out and attack people still has a twitter but Milo fans made fun of her not being able to write a sentence (because her IQ is probably under 90) and that is harassment.

One woman's son in law (or step son?), a store owner from the mall he was supposedly banned from, people who frequented the restaurant she claimed it occurred at. The problem, as I stated, is condemning a man without proof. You just want to believe he is a pedophile. 

Meanwhile, there is ample video evidence of Biden touching children inappropriately. You show me a video of Roy Moore being a rapist, and I'll change my tune. But I need solid evidence. It's too convenient for them to all come out at once right before his election.

Also your entire argument is very hypocritical since your top post has you confess that your life partner you live with makes twice as much money as you do. 

The most interesting thing showed by your article is the fact that almost all states are receiving more federal support than they pay for which means the government is borrowing heavily to support programs that it cannot afford.

Overall I grade your argument as an F might want to TriHarder next time.
$C: Except for states like Texas, Georgia, and Florida, as previously mentioned.

BTW, If that’s your rationale for everything then what about greedy Bernie? Vermont takes more than it gives, as does Maine, Pennsylvania, Hawaii, and Maryland.
$C: The states you mention all have a higher % of black people.

They also identify as a higher % of Republicans too.
$C: > with taking money from cities and plowing it into your pudunk little town.


you uh, you realise that the average farmer who owns his farm easily brings in a lot of money?

and besides, he's doing a service far more important than yours. The cities cannot survive without the countryside allowing them to live wasteful lifestyles in the pursuit of capital off of their backs.


$C: Youre a whiny prick. Stop it.
$C: Look, buddy, if you want respect you’re better off not starting a comment thread where you denigrate anyone who doesn’t live in a city. I personally have no problems with cities and I’m not entirely sure where you’re coming from with the greedy bit.
$C: So you're both disrespectful and ignorant. Good combo. Do me and everyone else you interact with a favor and don't be a buthead your entire life.
$C: So you're both disrespectful and ignorant. Good combo. Do me and everyone else you interact with a favor and don't be a buthead your entire life.
$C: The only thing you've "proven" is that you believe you're entitled to someone else's services at a price *you* feel is fair.

So basically you've proven that you're a spoiled brat.
$C: before it couldnt be possible,   now it might. Why give ISP this possi ility?

Can we make a deal that i may take everything yoj own anytime i want?

Hey! i mean, i only MIGHT use that. It only MIGHT happen. You lose nothing! So shall we? 
$C: Sorry, didn't mean to upset you, just inform you.  Keep well mate =)
$C: More intentional obtuseness, big surprise there.
$C: If they talked about things that spez did that they didn't like, that would be one thing, but they didn't. They just posted "fuck spez" and insinuated that he's a pedophile hundreds of times over. They wanted a reaction, and they got one. It just wasn't one that they wanted.
$C: So in other words you’re upset that sites you don’t like are supporting NN. That’s not a logical argument. NN has absolutely nothing to do with bandwidth if you had any clue about what you’re talking about.
$C: No doubt? I'm pretty sure if he was going to do it, it'd be on T_D for accusing him of shit, and he'd get caught real quick. If you've some evidence, show it. Even if it only points to the idea that he's done it on more than that occasion.
$C: Who is spez?
$C: Why would I waste my time putting together a thoughtful response?  Why would I bother trying to have a discussion with a person who views insults as a valid argument?

You're not worth anyone's time.
$C: Many liberals are for public education past grade 12. Public education is one of the most essential causes for the intellectual and technological advancement of humanity. How much more anti-knowledge can you get than being opposed to public schooling? (Betsy DeVos)
$C: Lol what?  You're either a really lame troll, or you're woefully ignorant of what the ISP landscape looks like. 

[This is not new.](http://247wallst.com/special-report/2017/01/10/americas-most-hated-companies-4/2/)
$C: I'm not going to tell you what companies to hate, or that you're wrong, your experiences are what they are.  That said, calling them a great company is not only subjective, but difficult to substantiate.  They're consistently rated as one of the worst companies in America for a reason.

When I was with Bank of America I never had any bad experiences, but it doesn't change the fact that they're not seen favorably by most people.
$C: Glad Barry could rebuild that economy, Ol donny almost has the job growth of Obama..keep practicing.
$C: >The government can't ensure that we are not censored without placing a huge burden on them and thus raising the cost of doing business.

How in the fuck would that raise cost of buisness? Because the buisness can't infringe on our rights so they can make more money? Lol what a load of horse shit. 

>I'm against net neutrality. The name makes it sound like it is good for humanity, but it is most certainly not a step in the right direction. 

That's because it is good for humanity... It is literally a founding principle of the internet for it to be completely open to everyone equally. That is literally all it is, I have no idea how you are struggling this much to comprehend how keeping the entire internet free, open and unmanipulated is some how a step in the wrong direction. It's like you're living in a fucking parallel universe were everything is opposite...
$C: And no response lol
$C: Still waiting on this "subsidizing" the internet for those who can't afford it fact.


$C: No. Your opposition is stupid and based on lies. It is utterly and entirely invalid.
$C: I hear you. It's kind of human nature to dig in when you don't or can't understand something. "I don't like it" is of course a shit argument if it even rises to the level of argument, but at least it's honest. We definately shouldn't be removing consumer protections on the basis of such irrational emotions though. 
$C: Is your argument that regions of the world don't have he internet, so the US should be able to handle it?  Kind of takes away from the whole "greatest country in the world" thing, doesn't it?  Why would citizens want a lower quality of life?  

>Much like above, after about a week I probably wouldn't even miss it.

I would have to say, this is likely complete and utter bullshit.  I'm glad you spent time around the world where you didn't have the internet, but I'm sure in your daily US life it is now a permanent part.

>Well, for one internet subsidies for the poor that were introduced in 2016. 

Do you want to remove all subsidies, you don't think you benefit from any?
$C: He went from being in the top 150 richest Americans to the top 250 after becoming President he gave up so much money time effort because he loves his country if he was doing this for money he would have dropped out mid primary he's the president  of the most powerful country on earth impeached sure you have been saying that the second after he won he's the last person to listen to fucking Putin and Russia if you can't understand that you're ignorant Xi Jinping bends over to  Trump   but apparently Putin is some kind of god with mind control or is he Trump's secret lover and will come out gay in 2020 and Putin will be his first man of the USA

2) AOL has absolutely nothing to do with net neutrality. There was no net neutrality legislation during AOL's time.
$C: What the fuck are you talking about? Are you lost or just well out of your area of expertise? You still pay for internet access; that's what an ISP is. AOL was an ISP and you didn't have to use their software.

AOL, once again, has absolutely nothing to do with net neutrality. There was no net neutrality legislation during AOL's time.

$C: [Heres a great example from back in July] 
(https://web.archive.org/web/20170725234519/https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/).  Its obvious their bots are malfunctioning.  We have 7 nearly identical threads with around 7k upvotes but each less than or around 100 comments.  Additionally, the threads themselves are rather boring content.  Theres no reason for each to have so many upvotes.
$C: Why do you think posts are all so highly upvoted, but the comments are usually a lot lower?  The bots only hit the posts.
$C: "I lost the argument "

Fix'd
$C: Ahh yes. The "They disagree, therefore they must be shills" argument. 

Must be nice to live in a world where facts don't matter. You can't argue shit. You're such a bitch, dude. lol
$C: Oh the irony is delicious
$C: The irony. With you i'm going for option 2 tho.
$C: A rapist is someone who engaged in sexual activity without the other party's consent. People under the age of consent CANNOT consent. "Actual" forced rape is not somehow more legitimate than other forms of sexual misconduct. Donald is a rapist. How is defending any form of rape acceptable to you, or your party? 
$C: Lol you are pathetic, you never had an argument and now are just plugging your ears because you were called out. 
$C: And I'm saying there's no Mexicans in Maine. It's not a product of shit.

And those are LEGAL immigrants. So that source is completely irrelevant to what we're talking about.

Here's your statement. "Wages have risen 30% from deportations." Which is total bullshit. One city in Texas and even in the article the locals are talking about how it's been bad for the economy. 

Wanna try again? Or are you just gonna go back to your safe space where every one agrees minorities are scary and facts << feelings

$C: No, I'm not. 

You don't believe there is propaganda from the left (Well, more like centrists and neoliberals) on Reddit?  
$C: Seriously, dude, I'm willing to listen here. But I'm not watching and reading through hours of randomly compiled conspiracy material until you prove your *initial* statement of the /r/politics mods being paid 29k or whatever. You Said there was proof, so where is it? All I need is a timestamp or a page number and I'll check it out. If that's credible, then I'll happily read and listen to what the rest your material has to say. I have no love for the /r/politics mods, so I'm not opposed to receiving that proof at all. 
$C: Step one: Make baseless, specific claim of censorship and shilling.

Step two: whenever evidence is asked for, hem and haw, make excuses, shift the burden of proof, cite incidental evidence, tell others to research for themselves, change the subject to what even is a liberal.

Step three: get down-voted by people who can read and reason.

Step four: continue making claim, citing down-voting as evidence.
$C: Lol
$C: I'm with everyone else. You need to provide proof.  You are just like all the people who trust what the president says even though there is overwhelming proof that he isn't telling the truth. 

We aren't idiots, if you want people to believe what you are saying you need to provide examples. 
$C: Trolls are going troll.  A lot of them are just straight contrarian.  Bernie was the first legit liberal (FDR/LBJ) a lot of people, including myself, ever saw run for office.  Hell, Al Gore and George W both ran at the center so hard by election day people in both parties were bitching there was "no difference" between them.  In 2004 Dennis Kushnich was the liberal in the race and he proposed, during a debate, a "department of peace".  

Sanders held his ground and never let up.  He used language that my new deal grandfather would have recognized.  The town* he spent his entire adult life in is now solid red.  He inspired people and they responded.  

*It ought to be pointed out the population today is about equal to when it was originally incorporated in the late 1700s.  It's peak was much larger.  I think it was the 1950s but it could easily have been the 1890s.  
$C: My source is Jeff Sessions not prosecuting and no indications that he's begun investigating. You OK? Or are you getting sick of eating shit yet?
$C: Yeah, there's people still thinking uranium one is a thing even if it was debunked dozens of times (even on fox news by smith), also the fact that no one ever tried to press charges is really telling about how it was all a distraction . "Lol" indeed
$C: read the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights. Read about Natural, Inalienable Rights. Thats what the country was founded on. The Declaration of Independence specifically says that the Constitution merely respects and defends our INALIENABLE, God-given Rights. 

You should have learned this in 4th-12th grade.


"**We hold these truths to be self-evident,** that all men are created equal, that they are **endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,** that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness."

$C: internet is like water of the 21st century tho
$C: yeah, I totally agree, our government cannot function when lobbyists write regulation 
$C: Cell service is capped. Most people use more internet than like 8 gigs, and satalite bandwidth fills up quick, and service may not be good, or existant In your area, and the cell companies have the same control over the internet anyways
$C: I never said the Internet is going to die. Where are you getting these assumptions? 
$C: Because he was ***required*** to. ***By Statute***.

Are you just playing dumb or are you trolling to spread misinformation here?
$C: Pretty much *any* Republican would have had a serious interest in repealing Net Neutrality. This is ignoring the fact that his FCC actually passed net neutrality rules, so why would Obama then undermine his own FCC. 

Just give up. You’re wrong. 
$C: He did vote for Trump, but I do not believe he anticipated having an idiot being elected to the FCC. Personally, I felt that all of the candidates had multiple flaws, but I guess that's just how it is.
$C: That's fucking hilarious
$C: I'm not trolling. I'm just asking what terrible scenario did I miss in 2014 that the 2015 policy fixed? 
$C: So you are okay with being fucked..? Just curious I've yet to see a logical argument as to why NN being repealed is a good thing for anyone other then telecoms / large corporations 
$C: Yeah your right people will start gangraping and murdering if they don't have 100mbps down you fucking retard.


$C: So in this imagined scenario, the ISP market has so much varied competition that an ISP with such a niche service as "christian centric internet" can still be a viable business model. 

Ok. Sounds like a very unregulated system to me. 

In order for such a niche ISP to survive, the market would have to be open to competition in the first place, which would imply that other non-christian services would exist to provide service for people who don't want christian censorship on their internet. 

So don't worry. 

If your imagined ISP stated banning anti-christian sites, there would DEFINITELY be an alternative ISP to switch to.
$C: Sorry. It just won’t work. Reddit couldn’t even keep a president out. Let alone now that he has power. 
$C: Yea

$C: Boycotts usually work when there is a substitute good or competitor. Let's not kid ourselves - if you are passionate about Net Neutrality it's unlikely you will be able to completely disconnect yourself in protest.
$C: An industry that's riddled with natural monopolies just broke out of the oversight required to keep them from abusing their position as the only provider of a service in many, MANY areas. The problem is that it's a choice between Abuser X, unsuitable access from Abuser Y or nothing. 

Your solution is to go with nothing because it hurts Abuser X? How about we stop electing corporate owned representation and actually apply our utility laws that already exist?

$C: Because they understand the value of an open internet.
$C: I really, really want to believe that congress will do the right thing. But most congress members are either paid off by ISPs or they don't understand what NN is and why it's important.
$C: Their start-up costs are not particularly high relative to other industries, they lack the production efficiency of NMs and they are not able to provide a service at an efficient lower price.  ISPs don't even consider themselves NMs because that would mean recognizing the billions governments have spent subsidizing them and they'd be open to government oversight.  NMs are utilities like electric companies who do not price gouge are expected to produce positive externalities as an operator of a public service.

ISPs are geographic monopolies and in some cases perhaps technological monopolies.  They dominated geographic regions early, (accepting short term losses perhaps in rural areas) and profit from population growth and anti-market lobbying.  Over the years, they've coalesced into several massive companies each with their own carving of land and political protection racket.

They are not natural monopolies.
$C: Which is more reason title II makes sense.

$C: Dude, this is not a debate, you sound like you are speaking out of ignorance, your words are just a copy paste of "it is not black and white", however in this case it is black and white, destroying net neutrality is terrorism against humankind
$C: Good. I'm glad you enjoy it there. However, as an American, I enjoy each and every one of my freedoms. And I hope they do not dissapear in my lifetime.
$C: Wrong.  Get out and try to enjoy yourself shitbag.  You might learn a thing or 2 instead of being told what to think.  Covfefe.
$C: Last word.
$C: > you fucking moron

So I guess you're just not going to learn from the lessons of the past. Like, you're actively refusing to.

Because statements like the above to people who were in the middle or on the fence about who to vote for drove them to vote for Trump out of spite. If you insult people you're not going to endear them to your position.
$C: You can't rebut. All comments have to be in the form of a question. But while you're here, tell me about Trump negating net neutrality. Is that what you loved about him? How he preferences the needs of the wealthy over the voices of those who have not been heard for so long? And Putin's oligarchy in Russia is joining forces with America's oligarchic patrons (Trump included) to form a **GLOBALIST** oligarchy. 

You're response is, "Wut?"
$C: So you mean to say that it's wrong when Reddit bans people over their speech, but it's ok when TD does it? And to support that argument you use whataboutism.  Stick to the point, you are only ok with censoring when it favors you.
$C: No, but what if she were? Is there something wrong with Filipinas?

Why is it always about race with you guys?
$C: I wasn't generalizing, fool. I was specifying.
$C: I don't know who you are quoting, but the beatings you took from your step dad must have hurt. Maybe even caused CTE.
$C: What gave ISP power is not the FCC deciding not to control them, it's regulations safeguarding them from competition, and sometimes even giving them money for infrastructure. The idea that NOT controlling something is "giving them power" is utterly twisted and backwards thinking.
$C: I don't think he is. I disagree with his worldview and how he wants to structure laws governing business, but I recognize his consistency here. He believes that the solution is for consumers to boycott and, in doing so, force corporations to stop activities they dislike. His boycott proposal does not involve government regulation.
$C: It's an ISP shaeholder you are speaking with. Or, a boot licking moron.
$C: You can read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7jsyqt/the_fccs_vote_was_predictably_frustrating_but/dr9qq3a/) if you're actually interested.
$C: > Oh I see. So what I was confused about was that your off hand remark was so vague as to be useless.

No it wasn't, it was a perfectly rational response to the person I was  responding to. Again, he was lamenting the concentration of government power. I'm pointing out that he literally wants the government to have more control over ISPs. That's neither vague nor useless.

>If you're against NN, maybe try explaining it rather than just acting like this? I don't really take a position one way or the other and think everyone is blowing things out of proportion and acting like children on both sides, but I try to take the time to explain why that is in specific instances.

I forgot that anytime I say anything negative to somebody who has implicated themselves as pro-NN that I have to have a disclosure in my comment about why I disagree with NN.

But since you're asking, it's because *at best* it's a bandaid that goes in the completely wrong direction. The problem with ISPs is that regulatory capture has allowed them to become monopolies. Companies like Google cannot hope to compete because of local regulations and lawsuits with regard to laying their own fiber. THAT is the problem. NN is throwing government control and power over top of a problem created by government control and power. The free market should be encouraged, and instead NN is basically saying "we're never going to have a free market, so let's just force the ISPs to do what we want." It's a ridiculous notion.
$C: Oh, right. So this is like one of those cases where they're only pretending to be retarded to induce those librul tears?

Get the fuck out of here with your asinine moron apologist bullshit.
$C: Hey brain-dead boy, it's the internet(well, not for much longer, for you) so do us a favour. Take the stick out of your ass, sit down, have a Billy and find an air compressor. Shove it deep down inside your balls, right down the shaft of the cock, turn it on and watch your balls explode, bud. Cheers, and oathenaise to ya.
$C: Yes, republicans believe what they do because liberals are mean to them. Makes total sense.
$C: Just pointing out all these hypothetical doomsday scenarios are absurd.  I can create some, too.
$C: He's a dick that won't acknowledge any evidence, he's either a troll or GOP supporter.
$C: Net Neutrality brings socialism into the provider space.  That’s the end of the conversation for anyone with an IQ over 50.  If you need clarification, see Venezuela.  All content isn’t equal.  Providers have the right to creat a plan that’s say 100/mo for someone who wants to watch hours of videos all day every day or 20/mo for the guys that just surf the internet or check their email for example.  You cannot treat it all equally without removing incentive for companies to create better products.  It’s as simple as that.
$C: I forgot that some random guy on the internet is the arbiter for what is and isn't a free market. 3 - 4 companies means it's not a free market apparently. How many would it take? 5? 6? The reality is that it's a free market when people are free from coercion. End of story. If there are only a handful of companies because of perfectly natural reasons (like high startup costs), that doesn't somehow magically make it not a free market.


$C: > It does make sense. Local new small ISPs can not offer country-wide service at all, if they will ever exist in the first place. As said, it costs a lot of initial investment to even set up a network locally, let alone provide country-wide coverage. Google did it, or tried to, but google is a massive company already, making their profits from other things. I do think that the local laws preventing further expansion were ridiculous, but I also think that the other ISPs had a hand in that as well. So for a small start-up ISP, the only way of competing is provide a cheaper service locally, then grow and expand from there. Meanwhile, big ISPs like Comcast or Verizon notices that in this area, there is a competitor. What they can do, is reduce the prices in this area ONLY to undercut the price of that competitor. This costs them a bit of money, but hey, losing customers to a competitor who then may grow bigger is a worse problem, so the goal is to eliminate competition. Either you keep the customers but they pay a little bit less... or you lose the customers and they will pay nothing at all. This is a good aggressive market domination strategy that works, and has been proven to work.

Ok but all you're doing is restating how predatory pricing theoretically works. I responded to that already. It's a dubious concept at best, and you're acting like it's a sure thing. Not only is it illegal, it's probably not even good business, for the reasons I've already stated and it doesn't seem like you're responding to. Operating at a loss can only be justified if you expect to then have free reign to OVERCHARGE in the future. The problem is once you're overcharging, you've created another opportunity for somebody to come in and swoop up the market. The other problem is the fact that Comcast can't just simply outspend Google.

You say " I do think that the local laws preventing further expansion were ridiculous, but I also think that the other ISPs had a hand in that as well." But saying "ISPs had a hand in that as well" makes no sense. I know ISPs had a hand in that. They are the ones lobbying the government for preferential treatment. That's why I want to reduce how much power the government has over companies, so that the BIG companies can't buy that power. Your solution seems to be the opposite.

>They could also choose to slightly increase prices in an area where there are no other competitors, to offset their losses for undercutting a competitor in a different area. Considering that internet is pretty much mandatory in today's age, people in that place can not choose not to have it, so they'll pay the higher price because they have literally no other choice or else become handicapped. This means that the only viable way of even beginning to compete, is to build a massive network immediately, everywhere, or hope that you get hundreds if not thousands of small ISP startups everywhere at once, making it unlikely that bigger ISPs can undercut the prices everywhere at once. The only reason why comcast and verizon and at&t can compete (yet also make backroom price deals to prevent too much competition to the point of losing money), is because they are all big and all have coverage everywhere already. They are established and want to maintain that.

No, I'm sorry but this is simply wrong. You can't simply raise prices in some unrelated market to "offset" their losses in another market. If they COULD, that's just what the prices would be at all times. Trust me, Comcast is already charging you everything they think they can charge you. The reason they're not charging you more is because, believe it or not, consumers do have power.

>It is so unlikely this will change anytime soon. If anything the loss of NN made it less likely that it will change. By all means I do hope that, in the case of Net Neutrality being lost permanently, new companies will pop up and do the right thing and keep themselves to the Net Neutrality standard without needing a watchdog to force them to keep them to it. We already know that your big ISPs will not do that, however.

What keeps companies in line is competition. What's stopping competition is the government. Reddit and the rest of the NN cults on the internet need to get their shit together and focus on the real problem.

>Nothing weird about that, no. I meant other, smaller ISPs. Because it already means that smaller ISPs can not provide a cheaper service than their "host" ISP from which they rent the infrastructure to provide a country wide coverage. This, in effect, means that we will indeed get separate versions of the internet, because it will start to use different networks. ISPs already charge smaller companies for accessing their network, but do not treat them differently than other consumers. With the loss of Net Neutrality they can also charge these small startups more BECAUSE it is a small company and internet is absolutely necessary to grow in today's age.

I honestly have no idea what you're talking about here. Why exactly do you think we're going to get "separate internets" if smaller ISPs crop up? We already have multiple ISPs, and we don't have multiple versions of the internet, unless I'm not understanding what you're saying.

>I am on reddit, yes. Not my main source of news though, I'm more here for the gaming subreddits and writing communities. Don't judge me.

>But, let's say I'm someone who watches a lot of news.

>If I want, I could go to CNN for my news. Or FOX News. Or MSNBC. Literally anything. It's up to ME to decide that. I can just type in the address and go there. Once an ISP decides they disagree with a certain media source or whatever, they can now block it from their consumers. For example, because MSNBC reported on the many protests against Verizon, and Verizon noticed a steep decline in their consumer base after news got out about those protests, Verizon now decides that MSNBC is negatively affecting their consumer base, and blocks it. They can even do it smarter and not block MSNBC as a website, but rather, certain links with keywords like "Verizon" and "protests". So that consumers are unaware that specific content is being blocked from them.

>And what about the actual news media? Where do you think they get some news from, and then spread it? Phonecalls? Snail mail? Some of it, sure. But a lot of it also happens over the internet. E-mails, other news media they use as sources, etc. ISPs can filter out e-mails from specific sources, prevent them from even arriving at the destination. They can filter out foreign news sources. In other words, perhaps they do not even NEED to filter out content from consumers, rather, they'll affect the news sources directly to prevent it from ever getting public in the first place.

>Possible? Yes. Legal? Yeah. Likely? We'll see. If it happens, I doubt you will hear about it though, because it will get filtered out one way or another.

The funny thing is that implicit in your fear mongering here is the answer to why it won't happen. MSNBC reported on the many protests against Verizon and Verizon noticed a steep decline in their consumer base. So why on earth do you think a scandal like Verizon blocking out MSNBC wouldn't have a similar effect? All of the pro-NN fear mongering is based on the incorrect assumption that consumers don't have any power. That's simply wrong, and it's rooted in people's irrational fear of markets.

>Is your water supply, gas supply, electrical supply, also all unregulated and on a free market basis? It is not. Would it be a good thing if it was? Or would the population health be at risk by some water service provider cutting corners on their water filtration system to get a better profit margin? Would hospitals be at risk of a power outage if some electrical company decided to cut corners and not provide a basic overflow of the energy net to account for power demand fluctuations? Would homes in the north be at risk of freezing over if a gas company decided it was a good idea to change the composition of their gas and provide less efficiency for heating but is far cheaper?

It absolutely very well could be better if it were in a free market. The fact that you say this incredulously like it's obviously untrue is kind of shocking to me. But aside from that, internet infrastructure is not the same as something like plumbing. It's a lot more feasible to put another cable on a telephone pole than it is to dig new pipes under every street.

>The government doesn't need to control a market and prevent competition. It does need to regulate and set specific laws so that the people are not at risk of being screwed by corporations who only care about profits and market domination (which is the entire goal of corporations). This is not a difficult concept, nor is it something outrageous to expect. Net Neutrality is such a regulation to protect the people just in case the corporations decide to cut corners. Does that automatically mean that the government is evil and actively trying to reduce corporate profits? I don't think so. Upholding and demanding a certain guaranteed quality is not punishing corporations unless it is a ridiculous quality that needs to be upheld. And so far, I have not yet seen arguments why Net Neutrality is so ridiculous.

>Maybe some of the rules and regulations needed to be loosened, sure. But this is cutting the entire forest down to get rid of one rotting tree, which was pointed out by a lumbermill company who originally was not allowed to cut ANY tree because it was protected.

I don't care if the government is evil, and I don't care if corporations are evil. What I care about is what makes sense and what works. If you want innovation, competition, good service, low prices, etc in ISPs, the answer is the same as it is in every other industry in every other country it's ever been tried in: the free market.
$C: LOL please re-read your comment. In one sentence you say the problems are the corporations. The next sentence you admit that local governments are creating laws that favor existing ISPs. Are you even listening to yourself? Your solution to government creating ISP monopolies is to add more government on top that simply CONTROLS those behemoth ISPs. How do you not see that at best NN is a bandaid fix in the completely wrong direction? The obvious solution is for you autistic fucks to focus your energy on getting rid of the local regulations that stop companies like google from creating their own service.
$C: To make sure we're on the same page. Are you suggesting that a company not giving you the internet is somehow "harming" you to the point where the government has to come in, put a gun to their head and make them give you internet? Because if so, you're batshit insane and have no idea how rights work.

>Without net neutrality these big monopoly companies can force you to pay more for everything you do and forcefully feed messages of their own agenda. Like Time warner, like getting your news from somewhere else besides CNN? Well with net neutrality it is legal for time warner to make it impossible to get it from elsewhere. Sounds a awfully lot like North Korea. Sure you can say "oh new companies can pop up" but when has that ever worked when has the big monopoly company not crushed the smaller ones?

You are a perfect example of the type of person who is the problem here. You have an irrational fear of markets, fueled by your ignorance. Sorry but they CAN'T simply do whatever they want to you. Why aren't they charging you $1000 a day for internet right now? Because, believe it or not, consumers do have power, even in the fucked up ISP market.
$C: [deleted]
$C: That guy is a troll undoubtedly.  His account is 2 months old.  I was mostly having this argument to educate others about why breaking up monopolies is good.
$C: I was the one who gave a timeline.  Get yourself a watch.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Supply side economics have historically failed over, and over, and over again.

The ONLY way I can see this benefiting consumers is if Google Fiber becomes a new norm.. NN is in Google's interest as most of their revenue is ad-based, so I could easily see ISPs of Google's nature, who are willfully NN-oriented, becoming the new norm.

The notion that these multi-billion dollar companies are somehow not already making enough to upgrade infrastructure to the benefit of consumers is a complete sham.

I don't know how you could see any of the modern statistics on wealth inequality in the United States and think that somehow our problem is on the supply side.

EDIT: If ISPs are charging on the supply side, how are new internet startups supposed to stay afloat? If they are expected to pay huge sums to ISPs in order to just access audiences which were previously free, how does that encourage competition?

I'd think an American like yourself would understand the importance of small business, and how detrimental the repeal of NN is to their interests.
$C: Breaking up the Ma Bell monopoly didn't destroy the telecom industry.  Competition is necessary for efficient markets. Monopolies distort the market.
$C: I'm 26. You proved my point. 
$C: There's a bit more to the second amendment beyond "shall not be infringed." Does a well regulated militia need AR15s? You can make an argument that they do, but it's a conversation we should be having. It is not blasphemy to say that the constitution does not grant us free access to all weapons. First off, that's not what the second amendment says. Secondly, the founders were not all knowing and they designed the constitution so that it could change to meet the needs of the people. I'm not sure what your answer to my hypothetical nuclear bomb question was, but your response about cannons and warships seemed to indicate that you believe the second amendment enshrines your right to own one.
$C: That's an interesting claim. Any numbers there? Maybe I missed the part where World War 2 was fought with muskets.

Edit: Or say, Vietnam?
$C: Thanks. Ya, I've been trying to catch up on the new one, and my opinions may change as they continue to revise them. But so far, it looks very similar, just to a lesser extent. Still tax cuts for the rich, but less so. Still a huge tax cut for corporations, but less so. And still the gutting of healthcare, and reducing certain deductions. Plus, they are still set to stop in 2020-2025, where taxes may rise and some deductions removed, like the one for medical expenses.

But it's an improvement. They're not outright removing as many deductions for individuals that were in the original House and Senate bills, like the one for grad students. I'm certainly thankful, they didn't deserve to be hit by this.

I'll keep researching and try to keep an open mind. But tbh, still not a fan. It trades a simpler tax code and a slight decrease of taxes for most Americans, for a major decrease in taxes for the rich and a lot of corporations, drilling in a beautiful wildlife refuge, estimated 13 million off healthcare, higher premiums, higher deficit, nebulous growth, and most likely other cuts as they continue to find ways to pay for the tax cuts. I suspect they'll make the same play they always do and cut social programs, hurting the people who rely on those more than an extra $400 a year. But we'll see.

And that's not even mentioning the fact that there's no proof reducing taxes will increase growth, but that's a separate argument. At least they're pretending to bow to their constituents by giving more take home pay even if it's temporary and mostly for the highest tax bracket. That's more than I can say about Ajit Pai, who has listened to no one, and who I will continue to insult all day. Fuck Ajit Pai.
$C: You have fallen for the trap of incrementalism.

Corruption is corruption.
$C: Oh you mean the courts that are being packed with Republican sycophants?
$C: Did you know that the U.S. revolution was largely started because of increased taxes?

One of the most significant wars in history was because of a greedy government attempting to seize more money for themselves.

Now we have the government, showing that its corrupt, and attempting to seize more money from the people and into the pockets of a few.

At what point do you think that the threat of violence becomes acceptable? Because it seems that you think even the U.S. revolution shouldn't have happened.
$C: To be honest, I think that's for the best. I honestly do not care about "fast lanes", etc. I care about the amount of red tape slapped onto the internet with a bow called Net Neutrality. Maybe this will force both sides together and a compromise can be made.
$C: Yes, they have to be in the spot that costs the 0.1% money. They didn't do that, so the 0.1% don't care. 
$C: Agreed. Union busting was a big part of destroying protests in general. People just don't know what to rally behind these days, because everything good is painted as evil and everything evil is portrayed as good. It's a confusing time to be alive
$C: Nowhere in the textbook definition of tyranny does it mention you can't remove your current leadership. It is simply cruel or opressive government. 
I don't disagree with you that you can't remove it because most tyrannical governments generally want to stay in power but again, what about the citizens with ties to the government who are living life just fine and disagree with the hoi polloi who are being opressed? 

No situation in real life is ever as black and white as you paint it, tyranny will ALWAYS be subjective. Going back to the revolution we got mad over a small tax on tea that was put in place to repay war debts for a war that we personally benefitted from so the British government felt that of course we should pay for it. And the "taxation without representation" was a hot button issue even though we were technically still British citizens and were represented by a government that was technically ours. 

The term "history is determined by the victors" rings true, please consider both sides of all situations.
$C: Think you missed the context clues. 
$C: Because you have never endured even a year of hell. You clearly don't know what you're talking about, but October Revolution would like a word.
$C: Holy ***SHIT*** that was edgy.
I can smell the teen angst from here, holy hell. Are you proud of yourself? You told me to kill myself, congrats. I'll go to t_D where we are making this country great again while you types cry your eyes out and shout over the internet.
I'm saving this one. It's a damn gold mine of laughter
$C: Forget about revolutions, a group of suicidal fanatics killing the right people would suffice. Suicidalness to prevent chickenouts too
$C: I do primarily use cell, especially since I live at college during the week. Unfortunately, most of my neighbors are elderly and don't understand or want those newfangled cell phones, and many also live in a cell dead zone meaning even if they got a phone it would be useless to them.  Telecoms in rural areas are nasty beasts with few or no alternatives.
$C: Good bot
$C: Thanks for admitting you were wrong

That's a welcome change
$C: If you're intelligent enough to understand my comment in response to your comment it had nothing to do with net neutrality voting. It had to do with me, not trusting anyone in government. Thanks

God bless. 
$C: ^^^I ^^^totally ^^^meant ^^^to ^^^summon ^^^you

Your vote is worthless to the FCC.
$C: **Interstate Commerce Act of 1887**

The Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 is a United States federal law that was designed to regulate the railroad industry, particularly its monopolistic practices. The Act required that railroad rates be "reasonable and just," but did not empower the government to fix specific rates. It also required that railroads publicize shipping rates and prohibited short haul or long haul fare discrimination, a form of price discrimination against smaller markets, particularly farmers in Western or Southern Territory compared to the Official Eastern states. The Act created a federal regulatory agency, the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), which it charged with monitoring railroads to ensure that they complied with the new regulations.

$C: POS Ajit
$C: Oathenaise.
$C: Okay downvotes with no counter points. Address this, if you dare. You have ignored my point about being able (presumably) to justify your own suffering, but not that of your kids. Guess you're not serious about it then, just willing to attack the appearance of an argument rather than the content of it.

This:
>People actively choose to do things that cause suffering, like climbing Everest and report back that it was worth it.

Why would people go through the unnecessary suffering of climbing Everest? How is that different to having kids?
$C: >  You seem to have a fixation issue here.

>You have to have a view of suffering that it is so terrible that there is no other to reason to live, simply because suffering exists. If you think this is true, kill yourself right now.

$C: >You know dude, you where can of fine at first but you had to ruin it at the end.

Okay mate. I'll take that advice into consideration. I'll give respect to suicidal nihilists when they earn it.
$C: You couldn't reach my level if you tried, Sir Mr Dr Supreme Right Commenter™ PhD Msc Bsc PDA. So you won't try. Good luck with life! Maybe i'll see you on r/watchpeopledie some day. When someone DOESN'T call the cops to save your life. (and btw this isn't an insult).
$C: > I don't see life itself as a necessity when the default state is "non-existence" instead of being biased by our desires influenced by evolution.

The base state is not "non-existence". We exist because of the coalescence of natural forces. There are places where it will happen again, given enough time. We are the universe experiencing itself.

The belief that nothingness is the end result of life and that should guide our principles is nihilism. Like I said to the other guy. I highly recommend (you won't listen, so whatever) that you read up on the [criticisms of nihilism](https://www.google.com/search?q=criticisms+of+nihilism&oq=criticisms+of+nihilism&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57.4198j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).

>And if there is a need to find something that makes life worth living, shouldn't parents have the responsibility to provide that to their children? Should you have children if you can't guarantee they'll find this goal?

No because we all have individual identities. The equipment necessary for one person to read another's life experience, emotions and thought processes and then on top of that, provide an an accurate analysis for the solution to their personal suffering, is too high a standard to ask for. If that were possible, therapy, mental illness (barring physical ailment) would not be a thing. You would be programmable down to the point of being an automaton.

>So maybe you should call me the idiot?

Alright. idiot.

>I see a point in suffering if this suffering can prevent even more suffering. We can agree on something here: some suffering can be necessary, even beneficial.

Again this is the core issue. There are a bunch of philosophies on the value of suffering, I'm not going to list all of them. Find 1 reason for the justification of the cost of life and your life will improve and you will pull out of nihilism. Stop projecting your shitty attitude onto your non-existent child and take responsibility for your wretched life.

>However, if given the perfect solution, like a red button killing everything instantly and painlessly, then sure I would pick this option with much less hesitation. Give me some credit here, at least this is consistent with my position.
It would kill you too. But really, there's no downside. You wouldn't even see it coming. No suffering. No regrets.

Then go ahead. At least you'd be fighting for the life of your beliefs then. Rather than your sad middle state where you are alive, but not willing to work towards living.
$C: You're fucking delusional if you don't think it was true. 
$C: Your stat doesn't prove the point you're trying to make.  

44% of Repubs is not the same as 44% of gunowners.

Example: 

There are 100 citizens, with roughly equal political representation in a two party system. 

50 dems (+leaners), 50 repubs (+leaners). 

taking your stats above:

20% of dems (and dem leaning indies) own guns, so 10.

40% of repubs (and repub leaning indies) own guns, so 20.

That makes 30 total gun owners in the total population, of which 66% are republican. 

I have seen other sites saying the Dem gun ownership rate is as low as 17% and repub as high as 48%.

$C: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/05/upshot/gun-ownership-partisan-divide.html

http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/06/22/the-demographics-of-gun-ownership/

So you're right. Republicans are twice as likely to own a gun than democrats.

That isn't all.

However that doesn't change that trump was voted in by gun owners, so the point is moot anyways.
$C: The people who own guns tend to own more than one. To claim that ~100% of Americans own a gun is crazy, every source I see reports closer to 30%. ~100% of people in your neighborhood might own guns, sure — but that doesn’t translate to a national statistic. 
$C: Simple: the average gun owner owns 3 guns
(Also, 3% of Americans own 50% of the guns)

https://qz.com/1095899/gun-ownership-in-america-in-three-charts/

Edit: if we're talking about anecdotes, I live on the west coast and can't think of a single person who I know for sure owns a gun.  

Edit 2: Ok, just thought of one person.
$C: There are thoughts there are as many as 600 million guns in the USA now. The 300m is so outdated 
$C: > I find that hard to believe

Fallacious argument from personal incredulity is fallacious.
$C: Because saying that the majority group supports something is 'condemning' them, even though you're *literally just pointing out what they are doing*?
$C: Youre working and saving to go back to school, you are far from a loser. Keep on grinding, your success is defined and determined by you.
$C: Let us know what your research turns up! Stay away from the anchovies though, you seem salty enough already.
$C: Not really. You're as boring as your are lazy.
$C: It does since it shows what repealing NN can cause. I hope you still have this stance when your ISP is fucking you over. Nice ad hominem.
$C: We aren’t talking about the internet here. Rather, the distribution of the internet and in Britain it’s not the best but it isn’t the worst either. The problem we have here is the speeds available.
$C: Wtf does this have to do with net neutrality? You’re excusing this major issue because of this immigration shit? Get real, how small is your mind.
$C: I think that the people in power are manipulating disenfranchised people against each other. They divide and conquer us while we argue over stupid shit that the government shouldn’t be involved in like gay marriage or giving the keys of the internet to corporations. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Gab.ai proves that Facebook/Twitter/Reddit/Youtube create a combined monopoly - an oligopoly, in the field of social media sharing of opinions and content.

Gab.ai being blocked from competing proves that my choices aren't unlimited. 

You clearly have no comprehension of the concept of emergent monopoly or oligopoly. 

When one political group (companies listed) controls 95% of all debate traffic, it doesn't matter if there are unlimited choices among the other 5%. 

Net Neutrality for all content. Stop the hypocrisy. 
$C: My response is being suppressed for no reason - trying again:
Gab.ai being throttled by Google/Apple proves that my "unlimited choices" are being limited by the same companies hypocritically calling for NN. 

When over 90% of the market is divided between a group of companies all promoting the same political ideology, it doesn't matter if my choices in the rest of the market are "unlimited" considering that 90% access remains throttled or blocked. 

Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Reddit - all throttle opinions opposite to their staff and/or ownership. They don't support Neutrality and combined create an oligopoly over the social media market. This makes them and anyone defending them a hypocrite when discussing actual Net Neutrality (and not the fakery that is this implementation of Title II that was overturned). 
$C: I have stated my extremist opinion, noting i was extreme and the reason behind why. I also clearified that it was beyond the internet (which just like the public roads you use and uh NEED in modern days). 
You. Are. Stupid. 
You are part of the problem. You cant see the big picture and ABSOLUTELY have to HABE EVERYONE AGREE WITH YOU. No!!!! Thats not how the world works. Also I've been doing my part in the diplomatic process, ive written the letters to congress ive called my reps, yet never once is what is the PEOPLES best interest in mimd. Neither side. Just money. How to make more money for me. Thats it, WAKE UP NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOU, YOURE NOT "TAKING ME DOWN". NO ONES WATCHING. 
You didnt even try to habe a conversation you fucking brainwashed idiot. Youre their golden boy. You THINK you kmow whats what, whats going on in the world but irl youre just some kid going to college with NO real world experiences. 
Ive lived. Ive loved, had that love commit suicide. That was when i was 12 bro. Okay, shit happens to me that you wouldnt dream of. You would  say "that didnt happen" but i habe the witnesses to back it up. I have that real life experience that has given me the ability to see past the bullshit and EVEN THEN i had faith that SOMEONE in power would give A SMALL SHIT about the common american citizen. But not fucki g ome does. 
Dont you think its weird that both canidates in the final 2016 election were cheating, common knowledge that hilary campaign had like 12 people assassinated yet nothing happens? Thats not concerning to you? 
That the moment we start sewing all the news channels for what they really are they turn "fake news" into a joke? Thats not wrong or alarming?? Dude..... youre sad...
$C: You think I’m attacking you tho. All I’m saying is you should take accountability. It’s clear many people got her message. Just because you didn’t doesn’t mean it was her fault that it didn’t reach your eyes and ears. 
$C: And when a democrat president keeps it this way, where will your bullshit be?

President Obama knew what was doing. Up until he left, he could have immediately deregulated the internet again and stopped the FCC from repealing NN using the 1996 telecom interopability act to prevent them from manipulating your packets (they could still throttle traffic).

Now it's all rules out the window.



But go on about how Ds are saints and the republicans are satan. That'll surely beat comcast. Comcast isn't playing you for an idiot. Nope.
$C: > I can't tell if you're trying to paint Title II reclassification as bad for consumers here, because you'd be wrong, that's what allows the FCC to enforce Net Neutrality.

It also allows comcast to sue a city from starting a competing telecommunications company. It also is what let Comcast rise to unstoppable power.

Have you even read what Title II is vs. Title I? Have you even done any research?


>Not to mention the only reason that the FCC had to do that was because Verizon won a court case in 2014 where the courts struck down the existing regulations that protected Net Neutrality.

You mean this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications_Inc._v._FCC_(2014)


Which removed JUST TWO provisions of the "Open Internet Order" by EO to be invalid because they violate the provisions of the 1996 (amended 2005) Telecommunications Act https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996


Until 2015, you had the protections of the interoperability agreement in the 1996 act, even with this ruling, albeit in a weaker form. As of the reclassification, you lost it *all*.

Congratulations.

And I'm addressing a slavishy devout democrat crowd. If I were on Fox News, it'd be an anti-republican one going on a tirade about their congressmen selling them out.


But, I **do** understand these issues. You do not. You see a vote and think that's all there is. You see some headline put out and go take it at face value when it's *your* political bias there.

Don't get mad at me you got played by Comcast for tribalism and didn't throttle the shit out of Obama for his necessary part in this. We would not be here today if Obama had done nothing.

We'd be fighting congressional republicans. And that's an easier fight then fighting the office of the president AND congress.
$C: >What in the fuck are you saying? Literally, what the fuck? You literally just tossed around a shit ton of word salad and topped it off by conflating multiple issues into one issue. Then you finished by arrogantly pretending to be non-partisan, despite this posts one-sided attack on Democrats. 

/u/ViktorV is what happens when a Republican steps out of his echo chamber and realizes he's been voting for the bad guy all along, but isn't mentally ready to accept being on their side yet. So he invents a new reality.
$C: Ah, you're twisting my words to use identity politics. How quaint.

And no, only the rich are better off in blue states: https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/opinion/sunday/is-life-better-in-americas-red-states.html

Personally, I don't care about inequality, it's a democratic stupid talking point. What matters is the floor, and here you can argue that blue states are better than red, but you can't deny purple states have it the best by this measure (relative poverty).


> Why would you "threaten" someone who fairly represents you by voting for someone who wants you dead?

You can vote third party or other. But you won't. And blacks absolutely are not fairly represented: John McWhorter has several publications and studies into this. 

There is no party that puts 'black' agenda anywhere NEAR front rank priority. Even hispanics get more sway (because they split their vote).


>  Labour unions are a fundamentally left-wing philosophy 

If you go by CNN and Fox News punditry, okay. But not in economic terms. Liberal literally means liberty, which means free. Unions are cartels of labor aka collusion aka monopolies aka not free.


> Just because you're willfully blind to something doesn't change what it is. Democrats are the ones who actually look out for the common American, and this is something that is readily quantifiable based on the last 20 years of congress voting records.

Who is the common American? You linked a BlueShare talking point that has several bills which fuck upper middle class Americans - the very people you need to be your doctors, run your small businesses, your small banks, etc.

All of which the democrats have attacked and torn down over the last 20ish years. I'm not saying republicans don't tear things down either, or screw the working class, but you're acting like Democrats don't do no wrong (or what wrong they do is justified for 'the greater good'). Even the Economist (a british publication known for not being particularly biased) has repeatedly said the wealth redistribution/progressive politics of Democrats have hurt Americans, not helped them, compared to their more neoliberal policies.


You seem to be confused that "americans" are all the same and make all the same and everyone should be the 'same'.


> our economy has on average done significantly worse in most quantifiable metrics when Republicans had too much power.

Are you sure about that? A downswing always occurs following a democrat congress (seriously). Does this mean that democrats are the real evil? Or do voting patterns of individuals simply follow economic trends and democrats tend to get voted in during good times and republicans during lean times (following the belief that when you have wealth, you share it, and when you don't, you don't)?

> Virtually all of the benefits, in every single imaginable way, go to the 1%.

You pay all taxes as middle class. The rich pay 0 taxes in an 'megacorp' economy. Tax walmart 40% more, you pay 40% more. There's no competition anymore due to excessive regulation and corporate control of the government (democrats included, remember dodd-frank? ACA? You know, the thing that was written by the insurance companies? it's everywhere).

Explain to me how you tax the top 1% without you paying for it in some manner without thousands of small businesses able to undercut the big players.



> No they haven't. I save money just fine. You're drunk on propaganda from the conservative media.

Bullshit: https://newrepublic.com/article/136200/racist-roots-welfare-reform

Try calling The New Republic conservative.


> Less than 1 in 10 black people are on any form of welfare. 

https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-97.html

Whoops. Nope. You're off by a factor of 3. A LOT of Americans are on assistance.

> Black people don't "like" or "aspire" for "welfare" and it has nothing to do with their voting patterns, you moron.

Name calling. Nice. And yes, it influences: http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/07/12/the-politics-and-demographics-of-food-stamp-recipients/

Same as farm subsidies influence rural white voters and rural hispanic voters. People vote to live a lifestyle they want. Or are you literally saying blacks are noble savages, unable to figure out how to survive in a system that routinely fucks them over?


> Stuff like shelters and food programs are basic components of functional society that all civilized nations have in the same way we have police, the fire department, and drinking water regulations.

Police, fire, and water are "fee for service". Don't confuse the two. That's a dangerous notion, also most assistance doesn't go to shelters or food, most goes in the form of free medicine and free retirement money to the elderly - who never even paid 1/5th of the amount they draw.

That's blatant stealing from the future, but that's another topic.

> White Republicans consume the most welfare dollars in the country by far. Especially when it comes to the elderly.

Correct. This doesn't make it any better. This is why the white elderly vote in blocks (AARP) against any changes to unfair, unsustainable, tax the young into poverty systems.


> Not happening. In the recent Alabama senate election....

I think you need to start looking back at history. 8% of the black vote not voting Democrat in 2016 is 2.5x the vote than in 2012 (3%), which was as much as in 2008, which was x2 as much as 2004 (1.5%). The trend? Upper middle class growth is starting to break away.


Don't worry yourself, they aren't going republican, but more and more Americans in general are classifying themselves as independent: http://www.people-press.org/2015/04/07/a-deep-dive-into-party-affiliation/ And that's a smart thing.


> Comb through this 

What about when the democrats reauthorized the patriot act in 2010? I see that missing here. This is a very incomplete, biased list that show cases less than 1% of the total votes taken by congress over the last 2 decades.

It also lists things like Dodd-Frank and other acts that are now known to be toxic. It also claims victory over TARP - literally the two things that economists point that has caused the most inequality in wealth in America since 2007.

Like, I can't express to you how propaganda'd you are. It's like the recent "war against coal" bill - just because it has a name that sounds good, doesn't mean the effects are going to be 'good' when it passes. I don't see how you claim Dodd-Frank a success when it was written by Citigroup and shut down most small banks in America that couldn't handle real time regulatory compliance on transactions. That was a consequence of a 'fairer banking system.

Also big bank profits went up through the roof.

Here's a right-wing biased article on it: http://www.heritage.org/government-regulation/commentary/why-big-wig-financial-execs-love-dodd-frank

here's a left-wing biased article on it: https://www.brookings.edu/research/setting-the-scales-dodd-franks-balancing-act-on-big-banks/

The most positive thing that can be said is "eh it may not be well balanced." That's damning when the leftist econ think tank can't even find something overtly positive.

> You're not independent.

I am. Progressives have the "if you're not with us, you're against us" fascist mentality, I know, but quite capable of not being with you and not being against you.


> You are naive and self-destructive all for no actual gain.

Ah, calling me a Sambo. How ironic. And no, there's actual gain. I do not like democrat policies. They are economically destructive and restrict my some of my basic freedoms. I do not like republican policies. They are economically slightly less destructive and restrict some of my basic freedoms, but restrict other's basic freedoms much more.

Do we get why yet? Or is this "whataboutism" not going to end until there's no democrats sitting in office anywhere? Still holding out for the 'blue wave' that's not coming?

> Except for the part where Democrats support a free open internet, technology, infrastructure, the middle class, the environment, clean energy, and believe in basic science.

Clean energy is a good thing. Except the government pays exxon-mobile subsidies for coal AND green energy now. Do you get it?

Infrastructure: democrats do not spend money on infrastructure. Should we bring up the DOT's state by state grade of infrastructure reports? Blue states spend the absolute least on roads per capita. Every. Single. Time.

What about technology? The same party that lets Google and Zuckerberg get away with stuff? That get slush funded by Citibank and others to implement crushing regulatory law in growing verticals in medicine till their mergers go through? Eppe-pen lol.

"BUT BUT REPUBLICANS" - I don't care about them. Tell me why I should vote for a corrupt, billionaire-supporting, poor-hating, economically bankrupt, and freedom restriction party that the democrats are. I don't care if republicans are worse. Why should I vote for your shitty party that only will harm me most of the time, just in different ways?

> Trump is so unpopular, and so guilty, he will be lucky to even complete one term

Sure. But again you're confusing this as a "US RESISTING AGAINST THEM". The public has a very poor perception of Trump...but also democrats and republicans. Republicans are not Trump. Remember that.

And you focus a lightning rod of hate at one person and suddenly the important office (congress, the supreme court, local gov/congresses) get a pass.


That's what I think I loathe most about progressive thought: it's about emotionalism and 'feeling' right, kinda like religious-right stuff. You don't care what sins you do, just as long as there's a demon you can point at and 'fight against'.

Because god forbid you own up to your own shit and make your party decent. But that's not the goal here. It's tribal control. My team needs to win, regardless the cost.
$C: That's a corrupt government.

Try the UK or Australia. 
$C: That's retarded, those companies would go out of business in a competitive environment. Too bad Democrats helped communications companies build monopolies via excessive regulations. Internet isn't a need like fucking water anyway.
$C: I am assuming that you have never owned or run a business. The small businesses and the "megacorporations" have to follow the same rules and regulations. A "megacorporation with teams of lawyers and lots of money have little problem navigating regulations. And the ISPs tried to do those things before 2015 and were stopped from doing those things before "Net Neutrality".
$C: How bout this - since we are from different countries, there is no sense in comparing notes on what happens there vs here at this point. I am telling you since NN became a thing here, my internet became shittier. I'll come back and let you know how we are doing in 6 months. I am certain the world will not have ended because of the deregulation. 

RemindMe! Six Months NN repeal and everything is fine.
$C: I didn't say you posted there, I said you were an example of a poster there.

But I shouldn't expect someone with your current responses to react positively to logic, so I'll leave it there.
$C: How do you figure? People are losing health insurance, the tax bill will completley fuck over grad students nationwide (i.e. the exact fucking people innovating and improving our country/ the world, so, better fuck them over right?) a lot of people are scared, ignored, trampled by their representatives who literally wont even appear in public, and respond with an email bot. Just because we arent facing imminent death from starvation does not mean these problems are not real. Not to mention, the mental health and opioid crisis currently underway, ruining thousands and thousands of lives.

You arent allowed to say what constitutes a horrible situation, and you arent allowed to dictate how people feel.

$C: /r/askreddit too 😔
$C: Sure, man.  Sure, whatever you say.

$C: A subreddit with two posts?  Ok.
$C: nice another person who doesn't understand what net neutrality means
$C: You don't know what net neutrality is.
$C: "Your side" has shown time and again they don't care about the lives of their constituents and only pretend to do so on the surface while they continue to support legislation that slowly strips away protections and rights for the vulnerable.  Pai and other Republicans don't know human decency, so don't expect it in return.
$C: lol you are so fragile!
$C: *Calls people retarded, faggots, etc*

"Kiddo" 

$C: I said not to huff too much glue; I didn’t say switch to huffing bath salts. 
$C: Yes they do. And there are many MILLION less people in rural states, meaning the people there have more valuable votes. And in the house, the numbers are skewed, the minimum number of reps a state can have is 3, which lets less populates states have more sway combined that the populated states.
$C: So how much Breitbart and Infowars do you consume? Hours a day or so you just keep the lies up all day?
$C: Wasnt proof for hillary but u idiots voted a moron into office
$C: > for claiming the problem is undocumented immigrants.

>Also your entire argument is very hypocritical since your top post has you confess that your life partner you live with makes twice as much money as you do.

Yeah, you would be the type of guy to look through someone's comment history to find ad hominem arguments. 

God, you're sad. 

>Overall I grade your argument as an F might want to TriHarder next time.

I grade Alabama an F+ this week, up front unrateably scummy. So if you want to have a real conversation rather than your obvious whiny tears about reality, let me know. 
$C: > Except for states like Texas, Georgia, and Florida, as previously mentioned.

**Cherrypicking**.

>BTW, If that’s your rationale for everything then what about greedy Bernie? Vermont takes more than it gives, as does Maine, Pennsylvania, Hawaii, and Maryland.

It's almost as if you can't help yourself but defend your own gaping faults by deflecting to others' equally problematic issues. Two wrongs don't make a right, and deflection doesn't address the fact that GOP States are greedy. 
$C: > you uh, you realise that the average farmer who owns his farm easily brings in a lot of money?

You, uh, realize that the average farmer uses illegal immigrant labor to make said money? 

The hypocrisy is golden. 

>The cities cannot survive without the countryside allowing them to live wasteful lifestyles in the pursuit of capital off of their backs.


"Off our backs"? What are you? Some kind of farmer oriented communist? 

Reee harder about the disrespect to farmers. It makes my point even clearer. Farming is one of the most heavily subsidized industries in the country **and** it relies in near slave labor. 

$C: I'm not willing to compromise on language to make people feel better. 
$C: > both disrespectful 

I thought being PC was a bad thing?

>and ignorant. 

The only one who's ignorant is the apologist who thinks that the Civil War wasn't the result of a whole group of extremely immoral people getting their asses handed to them by those who actually believe in this country. 


$C: hahaha, you do know we already paid for it, right?  $200 billion with a "b" to an internet infrastructure plan that never happened, and you think we're acting entitled?

What fucking planet do you live on?
$C: Did it happen in 2015? You *do* know the rules just repealed were put in place in 2015, dont you?

Again, your entire argument is based on what could happen, but theres no history of it happening. You failed to convince me. Have a good day.
$C: You have not informed me of anything, you just keep bringing up shit that happened in a foreign country relative to yourself to try to make a political point to a person in a foreign country. Why don't you go and worry about all the people dying from Muslim attacks in your own stupid country rather than telling me about my internet privileges, fucking retard.
$C: Plz stop doxxing and sending ajit pai death threats. 
$C: Okay so in your estimations that's okay to censor because it's hate speech or some other ridiculous muh feefees delusion you liberal idiots have dreamed up. Good, we have that clear.

Now how about the people who write "fuck Trump" thousands of times, call him a pedoifle thousands of times over, etc? Okay to censor them?
$C: Weird, cause the go-to example for NN supporters tends to be Verizon v. Netflix, which was obviously a case of Netflix being discriminated against and charged extra for the same traffic.

https://www.redstate.com/brandon_morse/2017/12/05/fcc-chairman-ajit-pai-attacks-twitter-censoring-right-leaning-people/

If I disagree with what the beneficiaries of NN are doing, then it seems like a perfectly logical argument for me to say that they don't deserve net neutrality protections. Fortunately, my democratically elected government also agrees.

If anything, the burden of proof would be on you to explain why I'm not allowed to call out /u/spez for being an unprincipled, anti-American, First Amendment hating asshole. Why should I support government intervention into the free market to help out corporations like reddit if I don't approve of how they run their business?
$C: Except he readily admitted to doing it more than once, and even said this is the first time he's been caught

Were you not around when that happened?
$C: >I'm pretty sure if he was going to do it, it'd be on T_D for accusing him of shit

I'd imagine you'd say the same thing if it was the CEO of Comcast injecting code into traffic to edit criticism of himself.
$C: You mean you lack the ability, right? You cherry pick one line out of my post and dance around pretending you have any idea what you're talking about. You're just an ignorant child who is throwing a temper tantrum because you didn't get your way. 
$C: Sorry did you eat paint chips as a kid?

$C: I'll ignore your tone and address the issues. As a principle it is fantastic. Everyone should aspire to keep the net neutral. As a government policy, it is a horrendous way for the government to control what you see and take that power from the ISPs. It also forces someone from the government to look at every packet and determine whether it is neutral, or pass that responsibility to the ISP which means they have to hire people to prove they are being neutral. 

$C: Its always crickets with these people.  You give a reasoned answer, they downvote and say nothing.
$C: Nor should be stifiling innovation  by over regulating businesses that should never have been regulated in the first place.

Keep the government as far away from my internet as possible.

Yes.

$C: 2) you’re not listening lol net neutrality isn’t needed since companies tried this here already and it failed. Keep up

AOL back then charged for time on the internet, the people didn’t like that and moved to another company, aol died off. Other company thrived.


I dumbed it Down for you. 

This tells you the people have power, if a internet provider does some shady shit they move to a better provider. 
$C: > Remind me again, where is your only source of evidence from

So I replied with more evidence. 
$C: Holy shit! Ajit Pai just walked into my room and handed me a plate of chicken tenders and I literally screamed at him and smacked the plate out of his hands. He started taunting me and telling me he is gonna make the internet great again and I slammed the door on him. I didn't mean to do that to Ajit Pai but I am in literal shock from the FCC vote today. Why the fucking fuck is he making meme videos? I am having a fucking break down. I don't want to believe that we don't need NN. I want a future where I can shill for all the large corporations. I just want to fucking receive my media matters paycheck. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't suppose to be like this, I thought pouring tens of millions of dollars into ads and shilling on reddit would have stopped him. This is so fucked.
$C: Lol this is great
$C: You're correct.

And those Democrats are also banned from Pride.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Edit- oh you edited your comment to make me look dumb.  Hey good for you learning from Spez.
$C: So by that logic then we can all admit to ourselves that all the net neutrality posts were botted? 
$C: So how was Trump cancelling it bad for the environment then? I told you it made no difference. 
$C: And we also have 5x lower population, so in general we pollute less. But that's not stopping India and China from catching up.
$C: Sure there is.

What does it have to do with this dumbass LARP being spammed by T_D? The comment you replied to said nothing about the left not having propaganda. Said nothing about the right having more propaganda. Said nothing about any of that. Simply stated that **this** is propaganda.. So what exactly is your point besides derailing the conversation?
$C: I never claimed that. I said it would make sense. I also said there's evidence of shills on Reddit. Evidence of bias and censorship on r/politics. In my mind, that's being compromised.
$C: Try again.
$C: LOL that is the burden of proof for leftists! Look at the downvotes!


**AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!**
$C: I've read both, I also understand more than just the parts you bolded. You post the whole paragraph, but only actually read less than 50% of the first sentence. 

The governments job is to understand and defend our rights, I'm not going to use the words unalienable or creator because they lack all meaning to me, as these rights are not in practice unalienable as they have been taken away, and are not endowed by any creator as I lack any belief in any such thing. However, I will look at the words that Governments are instituted among men and derive their powers from consent. That means that their power comes from the social contract made with the governed. That means as I said that our rights are upheld as part of a social contract.

 I also see the words Right of the people to alter or abolish it... That means the right to change what is and isn't apart of our rights to keep our safety and happiness. If we the people agree NN is a necessity for our safety and happiness and I would argue it is! And it is held by the majority then it is the governments responsibility to uphold it. At least according to the very paragraph you posted.
$C: Fuck it I'm  voting for FCC now, thanks bot. If I'm gonna get censored might as well have grammarly incorrect post banned.

Edit: this is a joke btw for those kinds of people.
$C: Sources?
$C: Yes, it does. But bitching and moaning back and forth does nothing.
$C: and i'm saying your un-american because revolution is the reason you exist today.  
$C: Technological growth is a big reason.

And I also believe in capitalism so I think it will make things better in various ways for the consumer. Other ISP providers can provide services that the big company is charging too much for. 

An example of this is TMobile. 10 years ago I thought they were a crap company because they had crappy service. 10 years later they are setting trends. Verizon and Att decided to cap data. TMobile destroyed them over it and their company is booming because of it. Now all of those companies offer unlimited Data even though the big companies didn’t want to. Competition caused them to have to change course. Yea it sucked for Att and Verizon customers fo the time but it is now in a better place because of the competition. I switched to TMobile and I no longer suffer underneath the tyranny of those companies lol. 

When big companies screw the consumer - the consumer changes to smaller company - who then grows and becomes much more competitive and match big company capabilities. 

The only negative to this situation is the possibility of only having one ISP provider in the whole area. I believe that is very very rare because of mobile abilities and satellite opportunities. So I assume that is a very small minority of consumers who will be hurt by a single ISP provider. And most likely, they chose to live off the beaten path because they didn’t want to be connected.

This is a good discussion...
$C: You must hate companies just like everyone else on the Left. 
$C: That's all up for debate.
$C: If reddit is allowed to censor me for my beliefs, then verizon and comcast should be allowed to block reddit for their beliefs. Fair is fair.
$C: /r/coontown
$C: Yes, because the government giving up some power.... means the destruction of freedom?

Your time math sucks
$C: You love the Brock cock
$C: I'm not worried about it. But I just want to tell you, I relish in the anguish that you and others who are worried about that issue. 

I gotta get back to work. Have a nice day! 
$C: Sucks you don’t live in a better place, but your entitlement anecdote hurts others who have the options of choice. So in essence you are asking everyone who gets the option to forfeit cheaper products so that you can get the same bullshit service that comcast will always offer you. Sounds pretty entitled to me.
$C: Spoken like a true entitled millennial. There are plenty of people who manage just fine without internet. 
$C: So it's not about monopoly. It's about getting service exactly the way you want it at the price you want with the level of quality you want all at once irrespective of who has to provide it
$C: Obviously the internet isn't going to die, it's called hyperbole. 

You are focusing on the wrong thing. If you aren't willing to watch a fact based 30 min video on NN you clearly don't care about the issue.
$C: Neither. I'm confused by this:

"and the president gets full control over who to choose as chair"

vs

"Yes, Obama "appointed" Pai, because he is the only one with the power to appoint executive positions. But he was required by statute"


$C: It prevents terrible scenarios. 
$C: No... 

You may be confusing me with the other guy. I am 100% unequivocally pro NN. 

The only reason I wouldn’t be is if the law simply weren’t needed (aka perfect competition). Under current technology and capital constraints, that’s literally an impossible market condition to achieve. 

It being repealed would only not be a bad thing if it wasn’t needed anyways. 

For example, imagine a “no selling visibly rotten food at full price” law at a grocery store with a plethora of other food to choose from. That law has no point. Who would pick that food? 

Much like this analogy, who would pick that awful internet package when I could go to 800 other internet providers with perfectly unspoiled internet.

$C: I hope the only reason you've ever hit someone was in self defense of yourself or another person that is being threatened in a physical way. Because if youve needlessly assaulted someone you're kinda just as much as a piece of shit. Just out of curiosity are you the type of person who wants to fight anyone who insults you? Or if your girlfriend or wife ever cheated on you would you want to fight the guy she cheated on you with? 
$C: There are various methods we could employ as a mobilized consumer force to boycott the industry. We could milk them by shorting their stocks. All we need is for everyone to listen to one person who will make the call, and we can amass a fortune to fight ISPs *and* establish municipal broadband. We just need to mobilize. Consider this: what would happen if we determined that in every city where ISP x and any other ISP exists we would all switch to the competitor of X? That is feasible. It only takes mobilization. 

Consider this as well: some group sets up a coin on the Bancor network, that establishes a contract with the intention of gathering as much wealth as possible to be used for the purposes of shorting one stock of a company that would be identified by the group as the company to be boycotted. We could destroy ISPs, but if you want it to happen, first you need to believe that it's possible. If you don't believe it's possible, then your fight for Net Neutrality is lost.
$C: Yes. There are various methods we could employ as a mobilized consumer force to boycott the industry. We could milk them by shorting their stocks.

Consider this as well: some group sets up a coin on the Bancor network, that establishes a contract with the intention of gathering as much wealth as possible to be used for the purposes of shorting one stock of a company that would be identified by the group as the company to be boycotted. We could destroy ISPs, but if you want it to happen, first you need to believe that it's possible. If you don't believe it's possible, then your fight for Net Neutrality is lost.
$C: > Funny, I just spent all day today handing out resumes

Handing out resumes?  At what?  Fast food?

No company I've ever worked for, aside from my first job at Geek Squad allowed anyone to just drop off a resume.  They were to be attached to the job posting form, on the company's site.

But, in reality, I post my resume online, and recruiters find me.

I suppose if I was flipping burgers, or doing yard maintenance, sure.  Maybe internet isn't required.  But, in that case, money isn't needed either, because they are minimum wage jobs, and not a living wage.

> I do know though, that you clearly werent born with eyes in your head that work, because if you had working eyesight you would not have missed the part where I said MOST people, therefore insinuating that there are the exceptions, obviously.

I will tell you *MOST* people cannot get a job that pays a living wage, without an internet connection, since ~90% of job apps are submitted via an online portal.

In fact, for most industries, not having an email address is a sure fire way to ensure the recruiter will never reach out to you to schedule a phone interview.

> But forget that m8, go back to being a closed minded part of the issue.

I wont forget.  Don't worry.  BTW, welcome to 2017, where most all jobs are posted online only.
$C: > Their start-up costs are not particularly high relative to other industries

I'm not sure what you think is going on. The start-up costs are extremely high, which is why Google Fiber is having trouble getting established. The lawsuits stopping them are lawsuits preventing them from piggybacking on other peoples investments, such as poles and conduits. 

The high start-up costs is building the physical network. I'm not sure why you think it's cheap to run wire across everyone's property to everyone's home in an entire city. Yes, if someone has already done that and you can rent space on their poles, then it's much cheaper. If you have to run your own poles from the backbone POP to the various neighborhoods, it's going to take a looong time to pay back that investment.

Contrast with the industry of selling cars, books, or bread. Or the costs of being an architect.

> because that would mean 

The fact they don't want to admit it doesn't mean they aren't.
$C: Because they’re busy swatting the geniuses who think unarmed people posses power on this planet. If the two could actually come together something might actually get done 
$C: The place our founders were willing to give their life in order to escape..... bang my head against a wall that people now want to turn this country back into it. Go back if you think the grass is greener 
$C: It is not a debate because you do not know what you are talking about. In parts of rural America, internet access has become extremely slow due to the implementation of net neutrality. You can't even maintain a decent latency or downstream anymore here via any of the wireless options offered in the countryside, because so many people use high bandwidth things like netflix. The demand for these big services literally cripples everyone's internet to the point that you can't reliably buffer a video, play a game, or download anything over a gig in less than an hour, even with a supposed 20mbps connection (which costs around $150 a month for rural areas that cannot get cable). So yeah, there are some major cons of net neutrality. I couldn't even use the online classroom system my college offered on a 30mbps package (at any time other than 2-6 am, i couldn't download anything at speeds higher than 250 kb/s, despite paying for much higher speeds. At 2-6 am, when few people on the area used it, i could get my advertised speeds) i was paying $200 for. They used to partially limit high bandwidth activities like netflix and my net worked great until the rules went and changed. 
$C: Well, good for you. I also love my freedoms, but i consider the right to bear arms too dangerous and uneffective.
$C: Wrong, you can ask anything you want. 

You sound very agitated, I think its time you go and get some shut eye. This is not that serious. 
$C: Reddit = "free and open"

t_d = Trump fanclub 

This reminds me of the whole politics vs t_d argument. The difference between the two, in both cases, is that t_d does not advertise itself as free, neutral, open, etc. Reddit and politics does. 
$C: Is that a yes?

"I'm in an interracial marriage"

"Why do you bring up race?"
$C: "You think that all X are Y. That's exactly why all you A are B."

You literally use the fallacy you're arguing against in your argument against it. But I'm not surprised. They don't teach useful things in school any more. Maybe try reading a book?
$C: I think we are interpretating his comments in different ways, at the very least. The question was wether or not it was a good outcome, which his last comment adresses inconsistently.
$C: Or somebody who doesn't have a moronic fear of markets.
$C: Do you disagree with NN principles? Or do you disagree specifically with the designation of ISPs as common carriers? Because it actually sounds like you're in favor of NN, only by way of free market forces. Just trying to keep the terminology straight.

Which is a perfectly fine position, and is probably even easier than what you describe: eventual 5G rollout will likely solve the local regulatory issues with new fiber infrastructure by attacking the problem a different way. I've actually been surprised that neither side has spent much time talking about how 5G will accomplish these goals in a rather straightforward manner.
$C: So why are all major ISPs against NN when it gives them monopoly and ruins their competitors?
$C: Why can't people just be respectful? I never said Republicans believe what they do because anyone is mean to them. Having a respectful conversation with someone is the only way you'll get anywhere, IDGAF what they believe
$C: They're not absurd at all as these companies have been caught throttling sites and attempting to fuck over their clients several times before, not so much with an alien claiming I'm the new president of Mars.

There is no reason to believe these companies will actually start to compete without net neutrality and a fuckton of reasons to believe they wont.
$C: Offer both those guys a plan where they can watch and browse whatever the fuck they want with no data caps and see if both wont prefer that one.
$C: Thanks again!

It's really two different mindsets, so I'm going to call it quits and agree to disagree. Thanks for your time to write that and respond to me. You're absolutely right that Reddit curates out comments like yours, which sucks because I find it interesting to read opposing arguments.

You did convince me, though not entirely, that the loss of NN won't necessarily be a massive disaster.
But time will tell for sure of course.
$C: For someone who has no income without the internet and will lose his entire way to survive it is the same thing, just a bit cleaner. They don't charge 1000$ because it has to actually be reasonable otherwise nobody will pay for it, but they can slowly censor and increase prices to be able to bypass these censors. However you went with the good ole personal attack by calling me insane for attempting to defend my means to put food on the table. So go take your bigotry and complete lack of intelligence elsewhere. 
$C: Because I am not breathing. Its called a comment. where people make COMMENTS about their beliefs...
$C: I think you're a bit confused
$C: > what was the point here again? no repudiation of any of my comments, no address of any substance, just a map of internet infrastructure?
> 

Uhhh 

Literally a map of the fiber optic network you claim doesn't exist, you dingleberry

How the fuck do you claim that's not repudiation?
$C: >Supply side economics have historically failed over, and over, and over again.

Tell that to the literal millions of websites who function and survive off that very thing (Including the very website you're using now)


$C: And repealing NN is good for competition, as it encourages ISPs to branch out into other territories 
$C: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_casualties_of_war At least as far as American Casualties are concerned: the revolutionary war, war of 1812, Mexican-american war and civil war(black powder) all have a much, MUCH higher body count than newer self loading rifles used in WW1(believe it or not; some of these would have been by black powder but I don't know exactly how many,) WW2, korean war, vietnam and the various skirmishes on the middle east.
$C: I understand corruption, all I said was bombing wasn't the answer, I never said anything about opposing net neutrality or even what my political stances are, all I said was no bombing.
$C: If it goes to court it will require more than 3 votes, it will allow the majority to vote for it, if anything it will make its way to the Supreme Court, this is a serious issue, if it actually reaches a real court, it will reach more audiences and more will vote to veto the FCC vote
$C: I never said it shouldn't of happened, I'm saying bombing a vote isn't right, y'all are taking this 700% the wrong way and in directions I didn't intend, the US government is heading worse and worse into corruption and failing, eventually there will be another revolution, and that's good, fuck the corruption, I just don't agree with bombing the vote for net neutrality, that is it.
$C: You didn't read the rest of my comment. The police won't *allow* you to protest in the spots where it disrupts those people. People tried to protest right in front of the One Chase Plaza in the financial district, and the police cordoned it off so they couldn't get in. They stuck protesters in a park, where they were out of the way and away from the bankers. They won't let you inconvenience them via protest. The system does not allow you the freedom to do so.
$C: No you just used a big word without knowing what it meant and you got called out for it.

Just face it, you're a retard. And that's okay. There's no shame in it.
$C: You have no clue the hell I've been through In my life and the amount of time I've endured it. 
$C: >  I'll go to t_D where we are making this country great again

Ha, please do save it so you can revisit it and apologize once your orange leader is removed from office. And you're delusional, the only one acting like a teen or a child is you; But that's not surprising, you're delusional enough to believe Trump is a good president or gives even 1 fuck about you. 

News flash, he gives 0 fucks about you, or the country. KYS

I'll still contest that since the Commissioner seat had to go to a Republican, and Ajit Pai was the Republican Minority Leader's recommendation, that no blame for today's move can be placed at Obama or any Democrat's feet though. 

I feel that my original point still stands. Democrats enshrined Net Neutrality when they controlled the Presidency and the FCC. Republicans repealed it when they controlled the Presidency and the FCC.

If the Republicans want my vote in future elections, they're going to have to stop attacking my livelihood and do a 180 on this issue.

 Your trying to use the fact that StockSlayer hasn't killed himself to claim that life must be worth living. But there are quite a few reasons why people may not kill themselves even if there life is terrible. And to force another into this life should be criminal.

It pisses me off when I see a politician get in front of a podium and say "we have to ban the heat seeking magazine clips!" If they aren't educated on firearms, they have no ground to stand on when trying to ban or limit them. 
$C: Like I said, I'm from georgia, even the people I know that don't like guns own them. It's just different here. Lots of people in the south east own guns. I'm at 3 guns, about to buy a 4th. I'm not saying what you're saying is 100% fact, but it's totally plausible.

$C: NN wasn't terminated under Obama. 
$C: The internet was under Title 1, "information services." That said that ISPs couldn't discriminate against providing a service and that it could not block use of the service. ISPs began exercising their ability to throttle the internet. It was reclassified under Title 2 so it could not be discriminatory, block, or throttle the service. Democrats were using regulations against the ISPs to prevent ISP regulation against the general population. Republicans are killing those regulations as "government interference" like they always do. However, this regulation was to prevent ISP regulations and power reaches. I dont think you understand, you just keep saying things like 'I get it,' 'you dont get it' and obscurely using the titles without further definition of your intent behind their usage. Sure Democrats were regulating ISPs but it wasn't for a power grab, it was to deny ISPs from a power grab. Some regulation is *necessary* if you don't understand that then talking to you is literally useless. 
$C: He thinks that because Democrats weren't able to regulate *all* of the ways in which Comcast acts shitty we should be mad at them for trying at all. 
$C: Not even close. You all are just knee jerk reactionaries who fap to tribal identity and don't give a crap what comcast is doing behind the scenes, as long as it's YOUR party.
$C: So you're saying that rich countries with mostly homogenous populations and relatively little societal unrest tend to not be violent? 

That might explain how the US can have half of the world's privately owned firearms without being especially violent.

Said the person who hasn't applied for University, College or a job in the past 5 years.


Just applied for University a week ago, only way to apply was through the UCAS form on their website.

Job applications for small part time jobs are almost always "Yea, just go on our website and apply" responses when you ask about them.
$C: You're misrepresenting the entire point on purpose. The regulations we're talking about are regulations that specifically target the kind of abuse that large monopolies do. It has nothing to do with small business.

>And the ISPs tried to do those things before 2015 and were stopped from doing those things before "Net Neutrality".

No they weren't. They did all kinds of censorship and throttling, and got away with it, which is exactly why net neutrality legislation was introduced to begin with.
$C: Lets we see, but this can easily effect us rest of the world as you know US is kinda big player. Netflix, Google for example are from US
$C: So everyone you disagree with is a T_D poster?

Interesting!

Well I'll make sure to make a mark of that. If I believe that T_D hasn't literally killed someone, then I'm very obviously an example of the users from there.

Wowzers, I bet the vast majority of Reddit are prime examples of T_D posters, then. Weird!

$C: > People are losing health insurance

What, the ACA? The bullshit that fucks over a lot of young people and others who don't want that shit because poor people are fucking stupid? Yeah, boo hoo. That cancerous act tripled the amount of staff in hospitals that don't do anything to benefit healthcare. 1/3rd of a doctor's work day is them doing paperwork due to the ACA and all the bureaucratic bullshit it added. Meaning doctors are doing less doctor work and hospitals are having to hire way more people to keep up with paperwork. I'm glad that shit is getting repealed lmao.

Incidents like these are why net neutrality is needed, and this is just a small fraction. Just because you're ignorant, or a blind partisan for Trump and the conservatives who are hell-bent on ruining the internet, doesn't mean damage wasn't being done before 2015. The ultimate redpill is that conservatives and Trump do not have your interests in mind and consistently support anti-internet legislation.

$C: What I mean: in the 21st century, our career, community, and education is 100% reliant on the internet. The millennial generation is not the author of modern society nor the internet. 
$C: yeah, like grandpa selling his woodworking projects
$C: Oligopoly is as bad for the consumer as Monopoly
$C: Let me clarify this for you then... No more than 3 FCC Commissioners can be from a single party, the president gets to choose the commissioners but like judges they have to be confirmed. Since there was already three democrats a republican was required and Pai was the only option Obama had that the Senate Republicans would allow through. It's really not a confusing situation.
$C: Pai wasn't chair when Obama appointed him. 

When Trump took over, he fired Wheeler and made Pai chair. 
$C: If your vague, "terrible scenarios" didn't happen before NN, what would lead me to believe they will happen after?
$C: Oops my mistake.
You seem like you've got a good understanding of the subject, trying to learn more so I can explain to others why its so important.

Is there a simple way to explain how/why Comcast and Verizon are the only options for internet in the majority of the country? I've heard of timewarner and Cox but they seem rare compared to the others

$C: What kind of profit do you plan to take from your investment schemes here? Boycott of utility companies? You're delusional. 
$C: Hell, back when I was looking for work as a highschooler even the shitty retail jobs made you apply via the website.

More to the point, IIRC NATO declared internet access a human right somewhat recently.
$C: Banks, ISPs, machine shops, skidoo dealers, Hardwood furniture crafters, grocery stores, a few bistros and steakhouses, pretty much anything but fastfood. I handed out 45 resumes today, as did my fiancee (as we both just moved to a new town)

So please tell me again how places only take resumes online.

Also, if your going to get a career, your not going to do so by handing out resumes, your going to go to school, which people did fine for many many decades without internet.

You just sound overly entitled, like everyone else in "the land of the free, and the home of the brave".

Get over yourselves, you arent brave. You dont stand up for shit anymore. You used to be the best, now your just a sad lump of moronic inbred fucks for the most part, easy to manipulate and gullible as all shit, just how big daddy wants it. 

But USA! USA! USA! USA! Right?

Thanks for the welcome, but Im already here, with the people who know how to handle their shit.

Excuses arent reason m8, just saying. You can spit them out all day, but in the end they are all just excuses to defend how you arent the problem (but you really are).

Its so sad that they have you morons so brainwashed that younare defending them and dont even realise it anymore.

Im done, so say your piece. I wont respond after this, you dont deserve to have me to waste my effort on such a hopelessly blind fool.



$C: #1) No ISP owns the poles or conduits in most places (possibly none of them anywhere but each state is different).  Poles are subsidized assets of the municipality.

#2). Fiber lines are run underground in most cases, the digging is more expensive than older pole-based cable lines.  Again geographic monopolies have an advantage because they don't have to adapt to modern infrastructure enhancements.  The cost of running new cable is cheap.  Geographic monopoly lobbying has prevented this from happening.

Ultimately you can't have it both ways, if you argue ISPs are NMs then they are necessarily utilities and bound by title II.  If they are not NMs (as they and their proponents have argued to avoid regulations) then they should lose any protections that are usually afforded to NMs, including geographical monopolization.  


$C: I live in eastern europe, Poland to be exact. And i'm glad i don't live in US. Why? Because we don't pay thousands of dollars for healthcare. Because there's nearly no way i can get shot while coming home after dark. Because we have decent social care. Sure, some things are better in US. For example, the jobs are better paid. But on the other hand, everything's cheap here. And university is usually free. And nobody here heard of "student debt", too.
$C: That's just a cost of living in a rural area in the same way that a cost of living in a state like California or New York is that you have less say in the presidential election than someone from Wyoming.
$C: If you don't have the right how can you evaluate it?
$C: Things Trumpers say:

"You sound angry"

"I'm Hispanic"

"My wife is Asian"

"I live in a major City"

"I am financially successful with a 401k"

"I've traveled all over the world (in the USN)"

"California is failing because of taxation"

"MSM"

LOL, so predictable.


$C: No. And you're pretty bad at trolling.
$C: You struggle in all aspects of life, don't you grandpa?
$C: That's fair. I think his response was an oblique way of saying "it's a good world even if the situation sucks; the goodness comes from the fact that government isn't forcing anyone to take particular actions with their property." 

I got that interpretation from the fact that he was responding to a rhetorical critique of abusive business action in a world without governmental protections for non-property rights.
$C: When I say NN, I'm talking about ISPs being designated common carriers.

And I'm glad you think it's a perfectly fine position, but you might want to pass that message on to the zealots on the internet who clearly don't.
$C: huh? I never said that NN gives ISPs a monopoly.

And why are all of the large sites like Netflix for NN when it's supposed to help new competitors crop up?
$C: They are.  Anyone arguing government control over anything will benefit the consumer is delusional.  The government is incapable of running anything remotely well.  Lots and lots and lots of history and precedent to support that.  So all the doom and gloom is yet another grass is greener scenario that will ultimately destroy that which everyone claims it will protect.  Government control inevitably means corruption, out of control costs, political games, inefficiency, etc.  I’m sorry nothing anyone says here will change that.  Ever.
$C: Of course they would, but the issue is at what cost to the company that’s being forced to provide them?  It’s easy as fuck to make these claims that we deserve GB speeds with no caps for 50 cents a year.   But nobody making them has a remote idea of what those plans really cost to maintain, support, repair, and so on.  Not all data is equal.  You can say it is, but everyone knows it costs more to serve up video for example that some simple web pages.
$C: >For someone who has no income without the internet and will lose his entire way to survive it is the same thing, just a bit cleaner.

WRONG. They're not the same thing. One is you being free from something being done to you, the other is you forcing somebody else to give something to you. The fact that you don't see the obvious and profound philosophical difference between those two things means you need to sit down and let the grown ups talk.

>They don't charge 1000$ because it has to actually be reasonable otherwise nobody will pay for it, but they can slowly censor and increase prices to be able to bypass these censors. However you went with the good ole personal attack by calling me insane for attempting to defend my means to put food on the table. So go take your bigotry and complete lack of intelligence elsewhere.

Wow you're so close. They don't charge you $1000 because people wouldn't pay for it... that means consumers have power. Once you accept that, all of this meaningless drivel from your side evaporates. All of the fear mongering about how 'there's nothing stopping comcast from doing _____' is meaningless.

$C: The literal millions of websites who function and survive of that very thing right now, as Net Neutrality is currently preserved??
$C: Really? I mean, a quick check shows that the Mexican war had a a count of 15,000 all told, 1812 had about the same. Civil war gets up to a whopping 600,000 or so. Of course at least half if not more was disease but let's be generous and include death regardless of cause.

 WW2 had 50 Million and Vietnam another 1.3 Million. I'll leave out WW1 because sure, maybe muskets were used , I don't know. I doubt they outnumbered the various other modern death machines.
$C: I thought you said no violence?
$C: Yeah I feel you on bombing, but you said violence, not just bombing.
$C: > and the police cordoned it off so they couldn't get in. 

This is why you need more people, like I said originally. At some point, they can no longer contain people. If all of wall street is a police blockade, that shuts it down too...

$C: Regulate =/= manage.
$C: > nd lol, you use kys as an insult, of course youd pretend being suicidal is something to make fun of.

I've been suicidal myself, so go fuck yourself?

I use kys as an insult because of the logic of anti natalism. *If you read my comment you would get that.*

Disinterested shitposting is not the same as rage-induced keyboard mashing. Projecting?

You don't actually have a counter argument. Have fun with throwing away your sex drive for no reason :)

>but at the end of the day you havent made a good argument for natalism.

I haven't needed to. I've only needed to show the flaws in anti-natalism. Let me repeat them for you, cause you weren't gonna read my comment anyway. Just knee-jerk flail ur hurt dick feelings all over the screen.

Anti-natalism depends on the idea that suffering is a negative thing and not bearable. This is more a comment on the reader's nihilism than any comment on the reader's future children. If you want to be the 6th person I show this fact to, be my guest.

Now, if not: Take your own life as that is the only way to rid yourself of suffering, which is what you hope to do for your 'unborn child'.
$C: I'm disgusted by single-issue voters who would throw their country to the dogs in order to protect their ability to own guns. Apparently the majority of gun owners don't have mental capacity to understand when they should actually be ready to protect the State from foreign aggression. Should the easily-manipulated be tasked with protecting our country and trusted with weapons, or should we leave that to the trained military? Only the fearful, with delusions of grandeur, feel the need to carry on a daily basis.
$C: If you believe the figures you cited of 330 million guns / 330 million citizens in this country, every gun beyond a single one that you own, and every gun beyond one that everyone you know owns, represents one American citizen who doesn't own a gun.

Your ownership of 3 - 4 guns means that there's 2 - 3 other people out there who don't own them, statistically speaking.

$C: It’s not free if there is a monopoly screwing you over... No shit we have a free market, but since the US ISPs are set up in a way that a few companies monopolize everything there is no free market, the repeal of NN harms the smaller ISPs more than it helps them. You have no argument.

Reddit is blocking the most popular non-default subreddit from reaching r/all of having its subscribers properly counted, while having other default subreddits actively astro-turfed / brigaded by botnets, with clearly biased moderation that shuts down opposition speech. 

You can find the same stories indexed but they aren't allowed to break into the front page or r/all.

https://www.oneangrygamer.net/2017/09/gab-ai-forced-to-censor-post-after-registrar-company-issues-threat/38824/

These stories were blocked by Reddit from freely showing up in r/all because it throttles the subreddits that are capable of doing so organically. 
$C: Yes, shut down on every level the SJW retreats to their "youre 14" insults and scrambles in hopes that I'm just an internet troll. No. You refuse to have a real conversation furthering my proof youre an idiot. A bafoon. A joke. 
$C: Admittedly, I merely assume that your feelings on how many people did or did not get her message isn’t a telling argument. She succeeded with connecting with 3m more people as far as it translating into votes, and that’s really all that matters in elections. You have this conviction about a mass of people you don’t know, about why they voted for her, and I’m kind of curious why. It appears it’s to justify you not doing your homework to seek out her message, but I don’t want to assume two things in one comment. 

It’s gonna be like this for every election. Candidates run for office and talk and shout and write their positions and policies for months before the election, but it’s on a caring citizen to go listen. And it’s too much to fit into a single sentence or sound bite. 
$C: They attempted it twice. Remember reddit in Dec 2016? Do you recall?

But nice try astroturfing to pretend the presidency and the congress was acquired by the telecoms in order to carry out their agenda.


That desperate to avoid deregulation you'd rather live in a hellscape where comcast is the only internet provider? Maybe a state owned, government one instead like China?
$C: >  ISPs began exercising their ability to throttle the internet. It was reclassified under Title 2 so it could not be discriminatory, block, or throttle the service.

And in doing so, abdicated the interoperability rules which literally means they cannot fuck with the actual packets going over the internet.

Congrats, now since 2015, comcast has been injecting 400 lines of javascript into folks webpages with older modems.

Do you not understand what you allowed to happened? 


Ever consider maybe Comcast had trouble passing SOPA/PIPA, so they also bought the president, had him regulate the internet pretending to put some rules into place, then later, just did away with it?

Remember: this is the *third* time the vote was up in the FCC. The first two times were under Obama's term and were stalled.
$C: Nope. We care what Comcast is doing.

It just so happens that Republicans don't. You such a manipulative little partisan shit that you can't seem to accept the fact that Republicans are fighting to make the internet collectively worse for everyone. Apparently that fact is giving you so much internal cognitive dissonance that it's making you invent new realities to cope. No matter how much you distort reality you can't change the position of the Republican party, and you can't change the fact that Democrats are **demonstratively** fighting hard to keep the internet open and free. Nobody is saying that because they're "our party" you salty moron, we're saying it because that's how they vote.
$C: We do give a fuck what Comcast is doing that's the whole fucking *point* you ass hat. 
$C: A lot more violent than the UK.

$C: Go to the library you entitled child.
$C: Misrepresentation is what you are buying into. I can only offer you my opinion based on my own research. I'd sugguest you do your own research if you want to learn what protections, like Title 2, were in place before 2015. 
$C: >So everyone you disagree with is a T_D poster?

Nice try, but a swing and miss.
$C: Try again, this time give me some facts or sources, dont yell your unsubstantiated opinion at me while simultaneously insulting me.

I doubt you will, but if you do I'll read through them and get back to you. If you just call me names and continue acting like a stupid kid, the conversation is over. 

Do you get sick of everyone you interact hating you afterwords? Must be lonely up on that high horse.

As for Trump, deregulation and a massive tax cut on the horizon are fueling investment into capital and hiring.  Consumer confidence has rocketed since the day Trump was elected as well.  More consumer confidence equates to more spending, more spending means more goods and services being sold, more goods and services being sold means more jobs and investment into capital.

So how about Obama?  Where's his "magic wand"?

Use and require are two different things...  I own my own business and use the internet because in theory it makes things easier.  In practice, instant access to me via email complicates my life.  That said, my business does not require the internet and I could switch to telephone and mail with very little loss of productivity or profit.

The guy says he worked for ShareBlue. He has insider knowledge and photos and personal info on people from ShareBlue that don't show up anywhere else. This doesn't mean everything he is saying is truthful but it certainly adds weight to his claims. He claimed that the mod list was sold to ShareBlue.

The mod list was completely taken over weeks after ShareBlue was formed. The sub changed dramatically from fairly neutral and well sourced to now being nothing more than a ShareBlue opinion piece echo chamber.

Does that not sound a little iffy to you?

Do you think spez wouldn't possibly do such a thing? After editing T_D comments, quarantining them, coding the sub differently to keep them off /all etc. ( have to laugh at the context here : *..but we’re not done fighting for net neutrality.* ) certainly there's some kind of bias there that shouldn't be right?


$C: Holy shit! Ajit Pai just walked into my room and handed me a plate of chicken tenders and I literally screamed at him and smacked the plate out of his hands. He started taunting me and telling me he is gonna make the internet great again and I slammed the door on him. I didn't mean to do that to Ajit Pai but I am in literal shock from the FCC vote today. Why the fucking fuck is he making meme videos? I am having a fucking break down. I don't want to believe that we don't need NN. I want a future where I can shill for all the large corporations. I just want to fucking receive my media matters paycheck. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't suppose to be like this, I thought pouring tens of millions of dollars into ads and shilling on reddit would have stopped him. This is so fucked.
$C: Your local Pride must not be Olympia, Washington.
$C: That literally was a joke.  He just linked to the current TD page.

This is why nobody takes you seriously.
$C: Perhaps, but i actually agree with your original point. Yeah td is manipulated too, most people on reddit can agree with that. And apparently this is why theyve been banned from the front page? So im not deflecting, i dont visit that sub as i dont fit in with die hard Trumpers

I dont even have a hard stance on net neutrality, but what i do hate is this site being ruined by obviously manipulated NN posts. The way you are describing TD posts fits these NN posts to a T. And yet Reddit denies it. I call BS and i dont trust their analysis as they have ulterior motives

If it was just this, ok, but the problem is that anti trump shit is literally infecting every aspect of my life. Most of it is unfounded alarmism. 
$C: >You also didn't address my previous question. Why annul the Accord if it doesn't matter anyway?

I did address it. Because everyone else volunteered to do it without the US anyway. 

>Why shouldn't you pay for pollution proportionately?

Because then India and China would still be paying out more than the US. But under this system they're being paid to and basically allowed to grow their pollution to 2030. You want 3+ billion people polluting on a per capita level as the US? Because that's where we're heading. 

And don't forget that these guys are already massive polluters. Where do you think all the trash and plastics in the ocean come from?

>How is this going to solve the problem of pollution?

See my first answer. If the Paris Accord can't be done now, even though everything else (outside of US government funding) is there, it wasn't effective to begin with. US cities and States have already volunteered to go business as usual, regardless of what Trump did to the Paris Accord. 
$C: How. Literally the only word related is "propaganda"
$C: Of course you think that.
$C: People always make things black and white when they really aren't so black and white. Yes they fear oppressive government, but they also knew the importance of a strong government. And government plays a big role in the interpreting and protecting our rights. So yes the bill of rights relies on the government to 1 uphold it, 2, to interpret it, and 3 to enforce it.
$C: If you are protecting our values, why would you be against a revolution of any type?
$C: OK, cancel your internet service and then your ISP will have no say at all.
$C: No, content is the information and reddit/facebook a carrying the payload, further carried down the chain by the ISPs. In fact these large sites are often their own ISPs.
$C: So? It's comcast and verizon's service, they can do what they want with it. If you don't like it, don't use the internet or use it at McDonalds.
$C: Cool, then you won't mind recommending some equal in size and legitimate alternatives to Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Reddit? They have to have the same potential reach in userbase. I'll wait. 
$C: No, coontown was a great subreddit. It was banned because spez disagreed with it.
$C: The more government rules.... the less freedom

Duh
$C: The bad part about either of those is when the barrier of entry for competition is too high, either due to corporatism and regulatory capture, or unregulated predatory practices.

I don't disagree that there is a regulatory capture problem in the market, which is why we need to focus on continuing the momentum from the Net Neutrality repeal to undo more competition-stifling regulations.
$C: Thank you for the clarification. I understand your annoyance now.

$C: Oh, well, now I understand you then.

Forgive me, and I genuinely mean that literally, for not believing that Democrats would virtuously ignore huge fat checks from Comcast and other ISPs in order to vote against NN.

$C: Again, corporations will do the worst if they are able to. They had to be forced a few times to stop slowing things and blocking things before NN. There is no reason to not think NN is a good idea. It's just the right thing for the citizens.
$C: Hey it happens, no problem. 

Great question! To make things easy, let’s divide internet service into two categories: phones and computers. I’ll tackle each one separately. 

*Phones*

These need cell towers to access internet when not connected over WiFi. Only 4 companies own 98% of this market share. To keep things simple let’s say they own their cell towers (they don’t, but kinda do). 

If a Sprint customer wants to use a Verizon tower, Verizon has to not only agree to let them use it, but they’ll make sure those Sprint customers get a worse service, at a more expensive cost (roaming). 

But why would one of these companies ever let a competitor use their equipment? Because their customers get the same service in return, which means more cell coverage. 

BUT, one of these companies wouldn’t allow a competitor with nothing to give them in return use their towers. 

So a substantial amount of coverage, and capital (the size of the company) is needed for a cell provider to be able to offer national coverage.

So that’s how you get 4 companies owning almost the entire market. Verizon has a market cap of over $200 billion. So to compete you’d need around $20bn+. Good luck convincing a bank to lend you that if you’re a new company. 

*computers*

This ones quite a bit simpler because it’s less conceptual. 

Basically, to get access to local internet, cable needs to be ran to your house. If 50 companies were allowed to exist, you’d need 50 companies digging and running cable to each home. 

This is physically impossible, and so customers generally are left with maybe one or two service providers in their area. Municipalities will legally allow internet companies to have a monopoly so long as they follow certain minimums of service and cost. 

So if you don’t like how your ISP runs things, well, tough. It’s illegal for another company to provide you access. 

We ran into this with power lines/electricity and it was solved by making them into public services. Classifying internet as title II was done with this goal in mind too. Pai just reversed that decision. 

You could get an entire degree on these topics (I did!), so it’s a lot to get out there. 

tl;dr:

For cable ran internet, it’s physically impossible and highly impractical to allow even two internet service providers per home. 

For cell tower provided internet, without $50bn+, a company will not be able to provide any better than highly local service (think 30-50 mile range)
$C: A simple way to explain it with an analogy: imagine trying to compete with the huge railroad companies, when you can only afford 10 miles of track, and even if you could afford thousands of miles, the government won’t legally let you build there. 
$C: > Banks, ISP

I don't know a single bank or ISP that will let you walk in, and drop off a resume.
$C: [deleted]
$C: >  Poles are subsidized assets of the municipality.

Incorrect.

>  The cost of running new cable is cheap

Except for the cost of buying access to the places the cable is run.

> Ultimately you can't have it both ways

False dichotomy. You can apply some regulations without applying other regulations.

Also, your boldface is obnoxious, implying that the reader is too stupid to read what you have to say without you screaming in their face.
$C: Great, then stay there. I have a 100% polish grandmother who’s family cake in the last 100 years. Obviously not everyone feels the way you do. Wish people from other countries would keep their $.02
$C: You just lost your argument. You cannot be a proponent of free and unfettered access to the internet and preach neutrality amongst all users while you say, 'fuck you' to the 46 million Americans who have to live in a world of substandards set by the very same regulations so that YOU can have more than they can. 
$C: I've seen the statistics for how many mass shootings are there, how many people are shot dead, etc.
$C: I said nothing from that list. When you're sounding like Alex Jones talking about the evil globalist scum, you know you've gone too deep. Go get some shuteye. I'm positive it'll help.
$C: Yeah, this whole thing has been ridiculous. On the balance, I think I probably would have left the common carrier rule in place if it were up to me, but "zealots" is definitely the right word here. None of the harms anyone has been talking about are going to materialize based on this change.

That said, Pai has been a contemptible human through all of this, and it's hard to come to his defense on any of it. And I doubt his analysis was any more in-depth than "regulations bad." But the end result isn't ... wrong, I suppose. Certainly not anything to get worked up over like Reddit has.
$C: > Anyone arguing government control over anything will benefit the consumer is delusional.

This is so wrong. Thinking greed will always benefit the consumer over government control is **highly** delusional. Just open a history book and o see that greed doesn't always end up well for consumers. 

I admit that there is lots of configurations where competition backed by greed is beneficial to the consumer. But there also is cases where it isn't, and government regulations and control is more beneficial. Such is the case in healthcare , education and (because of the monopoly situation ISPs have over you territory) internet providing services. 

We just haven't found the right incentives to drive the free market to improve this kind of services. Because of the associated costs in providing a high quality service in these domains, companies would rather join and harmonize a poor quality but expensive service that will serve greed at the top rather than benefit the consumer. 

Realize that this is not an all-or-nothin. Government control is not *always* better, no more than free market is *always* better. Both have flaws, a smart dude would realize that and try to make the best of both worlds. Rejecting one in bulk is exactly the definition of being delusional, buddy. 
$C: >The government is incapable of running anything remotely well.

the governwent wont *provide*, it will *regulate*, which is the reason we have a government in the first place.

>Government control inevitably means corruption, out of control costs, political games, inefficiency, etc. I’m sorry nothing anyone says here will change that. Ever.

**That** is being doom and gloom for no reason, what do you expect? A government appointed commissar following Ajit Pai around all day?
$C: First of all, use your real account.

No one is asking for 50 cent internet, they want FCC to keep the rules so ISP don't mess with the consumers. They already did stuff that blocked access to some apps and sites. 

The US user already pays a high enough price to cover the internet costs, hell, Comcast and Verizon said that money is not a problem since they're getting big numbers.

It's not socialism what people want, they want fair grounds for competition, what the FCC does is kill it with taking down Net Neutrality. No new companies can enter, some app ideas? nope, they get shut down by the ISPs and then they copy them with worse result.

You don't understand this because you might never give a fuck, or because someone law is made by a socialist, it should be killed, but believe me, this reappeal kills all chances of a "free" internet.
$C: > but the issue is at what cost to the company that’s being forced to provide them?


You are vastly overestimating how much it costs them to provide their service, once the infrastructure is there it's cheap to operate.

All they need to do is to use some of the vast amount of money they're already making with their monopoly to improve their infrastructure. Improving the capacity to provide a service in front of growing demand is what literally every company does, the only exception are internet providers who try to pretend it's reasonable to expect infrastructure from the 90's should still be able to deliver today as well as it did back then when it's painfully obvious the tendency is for people to use the internet more as time goes on.
$C: Now you get it.
$C: > Because I didn't claim our network didn't exist, which is a strawman on your part. Because what I was really remarking on is how our fiber optic network isn't all that great

Here's a direct quote of what you said:

>Telecoms were given tens of billions of dollars by the federal government in order to lay fiber optic wires across the whole country. Needless to say it didn't happen

So I provide a literal map of fiber optic wires across the whole country... And then you claim you just said it's not great

Sure kid, sure

>But here we are, in the mid-low average

Wrong, we're #12, behind countries with ten times the population density. Population density means less wire per customer. Run two miles in the US, get an average of 14 people. In South Korea? You hit 250
$C: The rules being repealed went into effect in 2015...

Pro tip: *The internet existed and was just fine before that*
$C: You guys are all nitpicking, I obviously meant bombing the FCC vote, violence is only the answer for some instances, not all
$C: And now guess what you've become, in the eyes of the law? An aggressor. Any non-compliance with a police blockade will be perceived as aggression. You now have a protest that has turned "violent". You literally just illustrated how/why peaceful protests can't and will not work anymore.
$C: >Common sense would say it's erotic asphyxiation

Lmao. Alright buddy, you win. I don't even know what to say to that. Go celebrate with your parents or something, have them buy you can ice cream cone.
$C: Well no, and times have changed we can kinda survive a little easier now 
$C: Wow, you just proved his points. You do seem delusional, reading his comment history compared to yours makes you look like the troll here guy
$C: I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed now.

They destroyed the housing market and finance, then destroyed it again with Dodd Frank.

They destroy business with over regulation do you know that only giant corporations can get into business now?  But you've never had a job. Not have you tried to start a business. 

You're probably some angry Bernie bro that's been stepped on or ignored his whole life and wants to wield government power to impotently attempt compensate for your own life failures.

Not sure how that's my fault, but it seems to upset you 
$C: I mean I could sit here and argue with you over this but honestly what purpose will it serve, go cry with the other net neutrality shills and then forget about it by January. 

Also You keep talking monopoly’s as if there was one giant company, where I live I have around 6 different services providers so that’s more than enough to create competition, not even mentioning the FTC and antitrust laws. all net neutrality is pointless regulation that doesn’t need to exist. Also the ISP’s wouldn’t fuck everyone over just to make quick cash, if they did they might risk losing all their customers and starting the nationalization of internet services as a response. 
$C: If you're a "conservative" siding with communists, then you might need to reevaluate your position.

$C: 1. I see posts from the Donald on All frequently. It's not blocked. It's not on the Frontpage. Pretty common.

$C: What the fucking hell are you talking about, how in the fuck did Title ll ever 'abdicate interoperability rules.' ISPs fucking with packets isn't proof of Title ll regulations being bad its proof that ISPs need regulation or else they will undermine our services. You literally spout off dozens of different talking points per comment, totally ignoring previous statements that were rebuked and you aren't even elaborating on any of it. Is trolling reddit *really* that fun.....   
$C: tl:dr democrats own, even though Obama sold you out.

got it. You don't care that Comcast donated more to the presidency, you just care you feel right.

OK.
$C: Then where were you when the internet as 'regulated' and everyone said this would happen?

Where were you when Reason said hey, wait, guys, the telecoms donate HUGE amounts of republican congressmen and President Obama.

Where were you threatening to Republican for president if Obama went through with the title II and removed the very weak protections the Telecommunications Act of 1996 gave us?

WHERE WERE YOU? Oh right. Fellating him and then acting shocked when Comcast executed part 2 of their plan - using the power your president handed over, and even tried to use in Dec 2016. 

Did you all forget? Just up and go stupid?

$C:  “Republican majority states and the south specifically pay less to the federal government than they receive in federal expenditures. That sounds like freeloading to me.”
$C: If it's got proof of your bullshit, link it.
$C: The link was the statement, but I guess it was silly to expect you to click on it.  New ideas sure are scary!
$C: You still havent posted a single trump policy that spurred all this growth.  Probably because you know the growth of the economy has been steadily climbing ever since ol Barry came in and fixed it.
$C: >I can't make you believe the other side

Yea because it is idiotic and against the founding principles of the internet, simple as that. Police cost money and enforcing laws are a regulation so I guess we should get rid of all the police! Protections cost money and are for the greater good, if you still can't comprehend that then I don't know what else to tell you. 
$C: It's objectively false that innovation and investment have been stifled. According to the ISPs own financial reports and according to the new companies easily providing fast inexpensive internet despite consumer protecting net neutrality. You can feel what you want but you can't change reality...

He did it once and then hasn't done it again, did you not think someone with dev access to servers could edit comments? You do realise every single platform you post on has the ability for that to be done, right? Facebook could do it, Twitter could do it, Youtube could do it etc.

$C: Webarchive is t_d frontpage? 
$C: I know that everybody is going through with it. That's why I'm asking. What is the reason that trump annulled it?

Him annulling it does nothing according to your logic, so why would he make a pointless gesture?
$C: Look at the subject in OP. Realize politicians are corrupted by big money. That  social media manipulation and propaganda exist. Understand that it will only become more of a problem. 

We all hear about the Republicans  love for propaganda. If the left, who are supposed to be better than the right can't admit that this is happening on the their side, then how are we going overcome this issue? An issue that has everything to do with net neutrality. Which is also about sites not shilling out (which includes censorship). Reddit has done this itself yet it sits here trying to pretend to be the good guy.  
$C: You've also been quoted by someone in /r/subredditdrama for having no proof for the dumb shit you're saying.

$C: Facebook and Reddit are hosting user created content, just like YouTube. They also ban hate speech, so they can even say it's curtailed/curated content - a specific brand of content. It's a "product" in that way. Reddit is not just a news amalgamator, people come for the user commentary, the photoshop battles, the user created memes, etc. 

None of that is true of Comcast and Verizon. They do not create original content, they are only the gatekeepers to existing technology. They are the freight company, or the railroad, or the riverboat. Reddit and Facebook are loads of product.
$C: I mean, I can understand if you felt welcome or felt like you were a part of a community, but that sub was NOT okay.

>There is no reason to not think NN is a good idea. It's just the right thing for the citizens. 
 
There are zero arguments in those two sentences. I am not just going to take your word for it. 

$C: So because in YOUR CURRENT LINE OF WORK you need internet, that makes it a basic human right for eveyone everywhere at any time? How is that at all a legitimate justification? Maybe if you're as brainwashed as you are, sure.

$C: You are as dumb as a sack of bricks.  Hence the bold.
$C: I'm not saying it for my internet access. I live in a rural part of Maine so I'm well aware of the shitty internet here. I used to live near NYC and when I moved I noticed that the internet got significantly worse. However, being an adult and realizing that the world isn't perfect and that the fundamental truths of economics are that decisions have tradeoffs and that human desires exceed the available resources, I am willing to accept the bad internet here for the other benefits that living in a rural area provides.  You tried to make me seem selfish by saying I was giving a big 'fuck you' to a minority of Americans (a group that I am a part of) for my own gain (which isn't true) but by supporting the repeal, are you not giving a big 'fuck you' to an even greater number of Americans for your own gain?

$C: All I know about Pai is that the internet mob hates him, which tells me precisely zero. If you can point me to some things he's done or said that is actually contemptible, I'm open to be swayed.
$C: Free market is always better.  I’d love to see any data that supports the claim that government run/managed anything actually improved - on en economic level - the program/policy.  Government has a role - to provide and maintain the framework that allows everyone to have the same OPPORTUNITY for success, but never to be in the business of picking winners and losers.

The incentive for business is to make money - within the framework - and to provide a service that more an more people will want.  If they can’t make money doing it, or their income potential is limited on an arbitrary level, there’s no incentive to compete or at least create new and innovative solutions.  If they don’t do a good job, the market will take care of them.  Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and so on all managed to become pretty successful prior to 2015 didn’t they?  Was the internet not free before 2015?  What effect did NN have?  I know of one - a decline of almost 20% in broadband investment after its passage.  Can you think of other positive outcomes?
$C: You’re kidding, right?  That’s not doom and gloom, that’s called reality.  Healthcare, Medicare, Medicaid, social security, and so on.  Yeah the government in some cases “manages” them and in other merely “regulates” them.  The result? Less competition, more inefficiency, fraud, waste, over regulation, etc.

Ever offered to pay for a medical procedure with cash?  Try it some time...ask them what the cash rate is.  Then compare that with the insurance rate.  That’s what government regulations do.

EDIT: corrected spelling
$C: a) This is my real account.

b) Fair grounds for competition?  So you think the government picking winners and losers is "fair"?

I don't understand?  FOH.  I don't give a fuck about pie in the sky assumptions, fantasies, end of the world predictions by smug millennials who don't understand basic economics or can't be bothered to appreciate the very, very long history of government involvement in large sectors of the economy.  I use common sense and prefer reality (or history) over people who either have an axe to grind with the current administration and will default to hating everything they do...or simple refuse to admit that they want socialism and want government to take care of them and make decisions for them.  I don't.  You may and that's your prerogative....but matter-of-factly claiming all these things WILL happen is absolute bullshit.

The internet is "free" and government intervening won't make it "freer" no matter what...it never has and it never will.  I'd welcome you to offer a single example where government intervention into a large area of the economy either lowered costs (no, I'm not talking about artificially doing so like the ACA which just shifts the cost burden onto everyone else), increased competition, or made it more efficient or "fair."  I hate to break it to you, but you might be on a very long and fruitless search.  The truly free market has a way of taking care of business - look at what happened to cable providers for example.  For years these scumbags perpetually raised prices and offered the same shitty service and customer support over and over and over...until services like Netflix, Amazon, Sling, etc came around.  People started cutting the cord and told the cable guys to fuck themselves...it forced them to lower prices, make a better product, serve their customers better, etc.  Right?  What incentive does the government have to do something like say control costs?  Zero.  What incentive do they have to not over-regulate?  Zero.  I'm just saying that you've got two choices here...one isn't the best, but it's still pretty damn good.  The other one is a complete pipe dream, and isn't based in reality at all.  It's merely assumptions about the way things should be, but probably never will.  I can keep using the ACA example again and again, but it doesn't seem to be making a dent.
$C: This isn’t an economic analysis...it’s a bunch of assumptions which is exactly my point.  All these matter of fact claims are both useless and ignorant.  When you can show me actual data that isn’t put out by some partisan group I’d love to see it.  Until then, common sense should rule.  Arguments that simply ignore rising costs for everything - including regulations, labor, and so on cannot be taken seriously...at least that’s my opinion.  Seems to me a majority of the people here would hate anything - whether good policy or not - that was done by the current administration.  Every company has the right to garage whatever they want - consumers have the right to pay that or not.  I agree there are some deficiencies with the status quo - nothing is or ever will be perfect - but government control will never fix what the free market would.  There should be more competition in the provider space...I agree, but government takeover won’t do that job.  Take a look at the ACA healthcare market ffs if you need a real time example.

People might agree with you, but unless you are able to effectively communicate exactly what you think, how can we, or you, know that we agree?
$C: Man i just gotta say that in my opinion you are totally right about this whole thing. The one thing common in almost all armed uprisings ? A bad harvest or two preceded, there was no grain and therefore no dietary staples such as bread. 
$C: > You now have a protest that has turned "violent".

The people would reject that assessment because no violence had occurred. This would show the government to be liars even more, which would rally more support. 

However if people literally start shooting guns, then there will not be that support because the public will find that label of "the protesters were violent" to be accurate.

Sure.

Because their opinion is illogical. This is a public board, I'm going to reply to stupid shit. Just like you have, asshole.

> the fact that we dont choose to be born cannot be disputed. and our parents DO owe us when they give birth to us, because they fucking chose to and we were unable to give consent.

Except it's the other way around. You owe them an existential debt for existing. You're just blaming your parents for your problems. They feed, water, clothe you, put you through school (assumedly), maybe help you get to university. How many more ungrateful years are you going to suck out of your innocent parents lives? Are you so special everyone of your bad feelings is someone else's fault or problem? Your parents dealt with it. Your parent's parents deal with it. And so can you, if you so choose.

>you dont understand antinatalism, you just hate it because it goes against your values. fuck your values.

You haven't read my comment. You just want to wallow in your suffering.

>if people have the right to have children, then we should all have the right to kill ourselves conveniently and painlessly.

Then campaign for euthanasia or move the countries where it's already legal. Go on, do it. If you're so invested in these values, Kill Your Self. I keep saying it. Yet no one does it. Because ultimately you guys are not looking for death, or to "save your unborn children from suffering" you are wallowing in nihilism and lack of understanding that suffering can be positive.
$C: The same thing I would say to those in a flood who needed a boat and didn't have one. The good thing about boats, however, is they aren't a threat to innocent civilians.
$C: Yeah that's great, change your voting habits, but until then you're supporting those that made these decisions.

$C: As a practical matter, antitrust litigation is often costly, time-consuming, and untimely (i.e., relief may come “too late” after the conduct has happened). Moreover, proponents claim that while antitrust law typically focuses on price and output effects—quantifiable in dollar terms—it fails to protect nonpecuniary values such as freedom of speech and democratic participation. The whole antitrust argument falls flat on its face because of this. 

Just because you have multiple ISP providers doesn’t mean everyone does. About 50 million Americans only have access to 1 ISP.

$C: I side with what I believe is right, regardless of what bullshit political marker people identify with. If you think that net neutrality is a good thing and supports conservative values, then I amend my previous statement to a “moderate who was formally conservative until it was manipulated and hijacked by brain washed neo cons” 

Having the internet open is a wonderful thing, freedom to learn and have access to information regardless of income is powerful, it allows anyone to achieve, learn code, new hobbies.

$C: Your acceptance of #2 tells me we will never agree on Net Neutrality - you did not even read the articles before coming up to the conclusion.

Gab.ai implemented better liability protections than its direct competitor Twitter, and Twitter still contains samples of forbidden content that it is legally required to remove (pedos and violent islamists are particularly frequent). 

Gab.ai is held to an impossible standard while Twitter is allowed to spread their app freely.

Twitter is not called the "app favored by pedos and islamists" or "app favored by alt-right" despite all three groups having a presence there.

Gab.ai is libeled as "app favored by the alt-right" in almost every article about the startup by liberal leaning journalists. Such lies are used as basis for the blocking of the app despite competitors being equal or worse.

Gab.ai can look for alternative registrars until you realize that once one of them breaks the Neutrality firewall and doesn't result in a riot, all of them can follow suit. 

Net Neutrality cannot have exceptions based on your preference - either all legal speech is allowed with equal rules for all speakers, or the system breaks down. ISPs are just the most obvious target. 
$C: Yeah. You already know you're disagreeing with me, yet instead of proposing an alternative you decided to insult amd attack, trying to oppress. So, knowing that i hadn't committed a crime (which you desprately believed i committed) i decided to have fun at your expense. 
Edited for spelling- again although hilarious (i lol too)  im basically blind on my phone. 
$C: 3 million ‘more’ votes. I’m sure she got voted for by some because of her gender and I’m sure she got voted for by some who wanted to avoid Trump (that really should’ve been sufficient, but not the argument here). You’re implying that’s all she had to offer because you state she said ‘nothing about her and what she wanted to change’. 

Again, you’re projecting what you got from her onto everyone else’s take on her message. And with that weird conviction again. She talked policies constantly. Making tuition free for in-state families making less than $125k, immigration reform, overturn citizens united, not raising middle class taxes, fighting for equal pay, background checks on guns, raising minimum wage... there was 40 pages of details and policies on her website that she continuously referenced when campaigning.

But you dig your heels in saying she only attacked Trump and suggest it’s because she’s a woman that half(more?) wanted her in office. 

You didn’t do your homework, man. And there’s info still out there to check and see. Why is it so hard to take accountability?
$C: Sure, but how much is NN worth to you?

Would you support a republican who voted for NN, but is anti-abortion and wants to cut medicare over a democrat who voted against NN, but is pro-abortion and pro-socialistic policies?

Something tells me you won't. So you're already being disingenuous. This style of politics mirrors Trump's - "whatcha doing for me now?"
$C: Sigh. Look up the 1996 telecommunications act.

If you're too uneducated to understand what an information service is, that's what comcast hopes.

Different rules apply to common carriers (telecommunications lines, and now the internet thanks to the previous president) and information services (formerly the internet).


That's why you had a weak form of net neutrality from 1996 to 2010, and a stronger form in 2010 to 2014, and a weaker form again in 2015-today.

Are you this brazenly dumb to think comcast didn't screw with your traffic from 1990 to 2014 just because? Did you forget SOPA?

PIPA? Has every progressive and democrat on reddit lost their goddamn mind because they just need to show they're somehow 'better' than republicans?

Okay, you're better than republicans. BUT POWERFUL PEOPLE IN YOUR PARTY HELPED THE CABLE LOBBY GET TO THIS GODDAMN POINT AND YOU DO NOT CARE. THIS IS WHAT THE CABLE INDUSTRY HOPES YOU DO.

DO YOU GET IT NOW? Jesus.
$C: > You don't care that Comcast donated more to the presidency

They didn't. You such a manipulative little partisan shit that you can't seem to accept the fact that Republicans are fighting to make the internet collectively worse for everyone. Apparently that fact is giving you so much internal cognitive dissonance that it's making you invent new realities to cope. No matter how much you distort reality you can't change the position of the Republican party, and you can't change the fact that Democrats are demonstratively fighting hard to keep the internet open and free. Nobody is saying that because they're "our party" you salty moron, we're saying it because that's how they vote.
$C: Isn't that what you people say? It's being taken over by Muslims?

I mean, there's lots of people in the UK. It's pretty multicultural. After all, you've got all sorts of people from all over the world, seeing as the City of London is a massive hub for international business, as is London proper.

So it's full of diversity.

So why isn't it absolutely rife with shootings? 
$C: muh socialist internet
$C: Well you felt that there was enough evidence counter to my "the tax bill will completley fuck over grad students" statement with a childish joke, so, that.

Edit: also, your counterpoint to the ACA and how that in any way related to my statement that people are losing health insurance, and your claim that it fucks over young people (who now have way way shittier care for more money)

and last note, " because poor people are fucking stupid? Yeah, boo hoo." fucking serious man? What are you, 16? That is not how poverty works.
$C: Milo got kicked off Twitter for harassment.
$C: You just said you don't care because it doesn't address Twitter "censorship," so why should I when you're not interested?
$C: No one likes CNN but in fairness the CiC’s diet and health are legitimate issues of public interest. 
$C: Why are you talking, again, about things that aren't really relevant to the point of political hypocrisy? I like those things about the South, too, but they don't override my respondibilty to point out other things that are problematic. 

It's not hate. I have no personal emotion in this; I'm commenting on ideas not people. 
$C: > You were saying it’s only southern GOP states

> He did it once and then hasn't done it again, did you not think someone with dev access to servers could edit comments? You do realise every single platform you post on has the ability for that to be done, right? Facebook could do it, Twitter could do it, Youtube could do it etc.

Lol what? It's not about the possibility of it being done is it? It's about it being done. 'Well, other people could have done something similar if they wanted to' - just a strange way of thinking.

I'd rather reddit not be a biased, shill infested pile of shit than have to go to a different site full of blatant racists for decent discussion and news tbh.

$C: $100 billion US taxpayer money being given away to foreign governments to do as they please, with no guarantee or expectation of anything is anything but a useless gesture. We're already in huge debt, infrastructure is fucked, and you want to give more money we don't have away? Screw that. 
$C: Net neutrality has nothing to do with shills. Stating that the poster you responded to even mentioned or insinuated anything beyond the simple fact that this whole story is a fabrication being spread by t_d is simple false. You are simply changing the subject from this being a completely fabricated story to try and spin it as no big deal because "everyone does it". It is the epitome of whataboutism to try and change the subject and distract from this steaming pile of bullshit being passed off as legit
$C: You are either reading WAY way to far into that comment, or you really have a bone to pick and are either lying to me or lying to yourself about why you brought it up.

The subject of the OP you responded to was that this was a LARP being passed off as real by T_D. Not politicians. Not corruption.

Propaganda has nothing to do with Net Neutrality. Shilling has nothing to do with Net Neutrality. Censorship has nothing to do with Net Neutrality. Reddit removes communities that break their rules and lets mods run their communities however they see fit inside the sitewide rules. You are truly clueless if you think the admins are "censoring" anyone.
$C: I'm flattered, but it's not "dumb shit." Which claims have I made that you require proof of? Tell me and I will search the web and do my best to find you proof.


$C: Well that's just fundamentally false... There was a healthy fear of tyranny back than, but they understood that a strong government was necessity. They were afraid of any 1 man having to much power, but the system as a whole needed the power to function. The "great" philosophers your talking about didn't distrust government they distrusted people. Fuck Socrates though democracy was the worst form of government for a reason. Thankfully we don't listen to him. Government should be watched by active citizens who express their full legal rights, to influence outcome of elections, and to protest injustice. Distrusting government only serves to make it corrupt through apathy.
$C: So you are for and against a revolution based on what "you" want. You don't actually support the right of an American to start over if their government becomes to corrupt and no longer represents them.

If Obama started taking away guns, you would have my fill support to March on the capital, but because I don't like corporations buying our Congress, I don't have your support to March and forcibly separate our government from business.

You don't care about American values, you only care about your values. Which from what you ha e said, are trash that would lead to a dictatorship if your values were the representative of the whole country 
$C: I tire of arguing with you -- we won, anyways.

Also: you guys can choose to censor what you want, and that will be fine. When the tables are turned, you will have no voice and no freedom of speech. We'll make sure of it.

Just wait until these young kids in the alt-right grow up and get older. We're going to be so cruel to the left.
$C: So you agree that censorship is good, and only things you agree with should be allowed? OK.
$C: You hope I get cancer because you don't even understand basic concepts like less rules = more freedom? 

That's kinda sad
$C: Dude you’re a fucking asshole across the board.  Look that this mans^^ comment history.... a straight up dick head.  Go fuck your mom.  
Edit:  downvote this bitch
$C: You're right.

Good thing nobody said introducing regulation was a good idea.
$C: Lol. Ok comrade.
$C: Oh, so you're just a troll. Got it. Have fun with that.
$C: Can you provide a cite for the poles being owned by municipalities? Because I actually worked for a company that planted poles, and they weren't owned by municipalities. Also, can you give me a breakdown of the ratio of fiber underground to fiber on poles? Because there's a shitload of fiber on poles, but I don't know how much is underground.
$C: Except the world is doing a much better job than America is. We pretty much don't even exist amongst the first world when comparing quality of access to the net. That is with some fifteen years of a mixture of net neutrality and its precursors. The government will not do shit about our nation's crippled, awful infrastructure. The only people who can and MIGHT (better chance than getting it from Uncle Sam, but still slim) do something about it are the ISPs who actually own and invested in the infrastructure themselves. These companies cannot and WILL not ever grow their infrastructure if it is not profitable. The current regulations make it an unprofitable climate for the ISPs.  
$C: I think agreeing to disagree is the best option. Not everyone has to have the same opinions after all.
$C: Thats not on the list. Your agitated state is causing you to have trouble reading. Go get some shut eye dude.
$C: Well that video he posted for starters. Imagine this: you head up a government agency and the public thinks something you're doing is wrong. Rather than reach out to them and explain the issues, you make a video mocking them. Now, you and I know they're being zealots, but they still deserve a proper explanation. 

Plus a crazy Pizzagate proponent was in it. The optics are terrible. 

He was also previously keen on deregulating the prison phone industry, with its insane rates for inmates in a totally uncompetitive environment. It's a completely indefensible position. He just has a history of bad choices. 
$C: Are you aware of the money grab that happened with cable companies? When investment comes in there, its not so often invested into improving the quality of service, whether regulated or not. 

Realize that things like prison, justice, education are working out much better in countries where the government operate them.

If regulations don't work, the problem isn't necessarily about regulation, it could be that the government isn't able to come up with the suitable rules. That happens very often when your government is corrupted by money, such as the current US government.

Saying that free market is always better clearly ignores lots of us history and economics, and doesn't wanna look elsewhere for examples working perfectly being managed by government: Norway's public prisons, France's public universities and healthcare system. Or the degraded situation of UK's public transit once it got privatized.


It's not always as simple as *free market wins*. I admit it's often the case, but not always, that's plain ignorance.

$C: > Japan, Sweden, Norway? Smaller, sure, but also lesser populations. Similar density. There goes that argument

Sweden :58, Norway:0.08, but the majority of both countries are uninhabitable

The argument didn't go anywhere, and the fact you included literally any of those (Especially Japan) really shows you whiffed hard

Hey, let's ban alcohol and cigarettes, they both heavily out weigh gun related deaths, seperatly.  Remember in prohibition how no one was able to get alcohol? Hey, let's make crack illegal while we're at it, that way no one can get addicted to crack. Banning things has always worked really well, right?

To me, his posts were about as condescending and they could possibly be, so I responded in kind. I'm not against taking the low road. Maybe you need to take a step back and consider how perspectives can change perceptions, and realize that, to me, nothing is more cringy than the drivel you've shit out on your keyboard.
$C: Fortunately I don’t have to make that choice. Like, I’m fine with eating TPP if it means negating all the other BS Trump has done. 
$C: >If you're too uneducated to understand what an information service is, that's what comcast hopes.

I wasn't asking how because I was ill informed or hadn't researched Telecom Act of 1996 I was asking how because it wasn't a direct result of Title ll and you offered no other explanation other than an exclamatory statement. Title ll didn't diminish it or allow it, the fact that Comcast keeps abusing any loophole they can despite increasing regulations isn't evidence that we need to forgo all regulations. Quite the contrary. I knew that Comcast was fucking with out connection, that's why the internet was reclassified from title l to title ll. It was an effort to fight it. They are trying. They have not succeeded entirely *yet.* Quit pointing your finger in the wrong direction and let them actually accomplish something. 
$C: "You people?" the fat angry white men you imagine you're talking to every time someone disagrees with you on the internet?

$C: Wanting traffic to be treated equally no matter the source is Socialist? Thanks for confirming you're unable to make an argument before spouting shit. 

I suppose it's also socialist for wanting water for my bath and water for my sink to be the same cost?
$C: So you want to go over the math of that? The bill aims to count fee waivers and grants as income tax. Whether that part of it will pass or not hasn't been decided, but it's obviously going to be different for everyone. If you get 1 million in grants and fee waivers then sure it'll be pretty hefty. But if you're taking 30-50k and having to list that as income, how much will you think that REALISTICALLY will affect people? Do you honestly think it's enough to "fuck" them over?
$C: Well, that's objectively untrue. He criticized a feminist cuntwad.
$C: My side already won so it's not like I have anything to be worried about. I'm open to hearing why you support net neutrality, but you haven't posted anything ITT except fuck conservatives, fuck free speech and supporting hate speech laws, so it's hard to see how net neutrality has nothing to do with censorship or anything to do with actual neutrality.
$C: Please explain the difference to me. Keep in mind you also said “specifically in the south” too.
$C: I read it when it happened and stopped giving a shit.

And you aren't linking any of your horseshit, after I asked for proof multiple times. *Real shocker*
$C: You're joking, right?  I'm overwhelmed with how stupid this is.
$C: Thanks bud, I think I'll continue to view reality as it is. Unfortunately in this case, the reality is you've been duped. Thankfully you're in the minority.

$C: You're putting words into my mouth. It's as simple as this: this is a ridiculous reason to revolt, so no, I don't support it. Taking away 2A rights and changing the way the internet is regulated are two very different things. One of those have been in America's interest since our nations inception, the other is a bunch of pricks speculating and fear mongering without fully understanding what they're so afraid of.
$C: The best thing about you is that you cry about censorship from private corporations and yet support the rollback of net neutrality that will make that even easier.

Your brain is twisted, and you're very confused. You, and the rest of the alt-right, are headed for a nasty fall. Alabama just voted democrat for the first time in decades. This is not going to end well for you, and I really can't wait for you to realize your fantasy is just that - a fantasy.

I'm not surprised you giddily describe denying your fellow citizens equal rights. That fits. You're a traitor, just like your president. I wish they hadn't changed the punishment for that.
$C: I believe that censoring hateful or dangerous content is okay, but censorship isn't just "censoring opinions that you disagree with". Arresting a person who threatens another persons life is censorship, but it's okay because free speech is stopped at threatning other people.

Censorship isn't good or bad, it just depends on how it's used. And no matter how much you say it, coontown was fairly banned. Besides, at the start of the thread, you sounded like you were pro-censorship? OK.
$C: I think you might be drunk.
$C: Im sorry, I thought you were talking about removing laws that said you cannot start a new ISP
$C: It's ok if you can't make a good argument in favor of your position. Most people have a hard time with anything beyond sound bites. I really don't hold it against you.
$C: If anyone is a troll its the one who gets shot down and has no comeback. You have no retort aside from calling me a troll because you cant prove somebody wrong if they are correct.

No shit.

$C: No I don't think they do deserve a proper explanation. They've behaved terribly and disgustingly. I've seen posts calling for his death with hundreds of upvotes. You don't get to treat somebody like that and then complain when he mocks you.
$C: Gonna need some detail on that money grab you’re referring to.  I’ll just say that the strength of broadband providers was again the fault of government - specifically local governments/municipalities that actually create virtual monopolies.  Here in Dallas we were all set to get Google Fiber.  Amazing speeds for something like 40 or 50 bucks a month.  But what ended up happening is the barriers to entry enforced by the local governments who ultimately decide who gets to lay down infrastructure and where made it virtually impossible and economically unreasonable.  As far as I know in DFW only ATT and Comcast can operate in several areas and in others if they don’t serve them then Verizon (or company that bought their FiOS) subsidiary can serve that particular area.  I’m fuzzy on those rules, but that’s an example of how companies like that can charge astronomical prices for below average service(s).  You like calling the Philippines and answering the same question
13 times before you can actually speak to someone who can help you?  I know I don’t.

You don’t increase competition by handing over the keys to the government.  You don’t make it cheaper, you don’t make it more  efficient, and you don’t foster something real and sustainable.  

Feel free to find examples on a large scale.  Justice and education have nothing to do with Net Neutrality, but it’s much more simple to implement a successful form of socialism on a small scale.  The problem is that the majority of success stories involve very homogeneous populations and incredibly high taxes and even in some of those cases the degree of success is debatable.
$C: [deleted]
$C: You're saying net neutrality hasn't been around since 2015? That is not correct. Net neutrality was preserved in 2015 under Title II. Your argument is hard to tackle only because of how removed from reality it is.

None of these scenarios will be reversed going forward, that will be the fallout of today's vote.

Oh let me guess you're a teenager? Everything's your parents fault, they're selfish for making you exist and more importantly I JUST DONT GET, YOUR DEPRESSION, MAN. Well I never mentioned Depression, just like I never called you WEAK. Stop TALKING ABOUT YOUR LIFE AT ME. Deal with your depression. I want you to understand that **suffering** can be valuable. If you want to talk about your depression, then fine but that's a different topic.

>the idea that suffering can be positive is an OPINION

The idea that suffering can be positive is part of a PHILOSOPHY. The entire viewpoint you have on life. You know, the thing that influences your understanding of the world the most. I have OPINIONS about what your PHILOSOPHY is and should be. 

>you arent looking to enlighten people. you just want anyone who has a different mindset than yours, which is to reproduce without questioning it like unintelligent organisms, to fuck off.

> ill suck however many "ungrateful years" i need to until i find a painless way to kill myself.

Then you have a goal. So why not invest in having some great sex, some great times, and some great effort into achieving that goal and hey MAYBE you'll realize life is worth living after all. This is not about "anti-natalism". This is about the depression that is eating up your life, LIKE YOU KEEP TRYING TO TELL ME.

So here's the deal with PHILOSOPHY that you don't give a fuck about:

Nihilism is the belief in nothing. You will never form a coherent goal in life if you believe in nothing as the highest value. You will never value suffering and you will float (not suicide) through life doing NOTHING. because that's what you believe in. 

Existentialism is the belief that we only exist for our base survival instincts and desires to exist. Hence "exist"entialism.

If either of these two things ring true with you. Read Neitschze or any of the famous philosophers on the topic because they can challenge your perspective on life. 

>you havent read my comment. you just want to make sure your life values feel valid.

Why the fuck would I give one flying shit what you think of my values? They're MY values. I've been through where you are and forged a decision to follow these values through more life experience (and possibly reading) than you can think exists. Do some fucking work to make your intellectual life better. Read good philosophers.

Or i'll fuck ur mum. And she'll love it.
$C: This went from a discussion about limitations and controls to and argument about outright banning. There needs to be strict gun control and training. I know what is already in place, but it's too easy to squeeze through the cracks. If you want to own a gun, don't be a felon or has any psychological issues, and undergo some thorough training so you're not firing wildly into a crown of innocents when you think you see a terrorist.
$C: How could this benefit anyone except ISP owners? It's nice to have vague beliefs like "small government," but in this case how could taking the power of enforcement out of the government's hands possibly be a good thing? 

And aside from that, it's not the amount of beliefs, it's how much they matter. And I'm sure you have more than one disagreement why the Republican party, the question is then which extra contradiction flips your allegiance. 
$C: You're a Trump supporter

While telling people to be skeptical of sources

Bizarre.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Which Trump policies?

Most of his are expanded Obama-era policies or roll backs, which of themselves are expanded W Bush era policies.


This is the issue. Democrats will never vote republican because of single issue (and vice versa), so corps have the advantage: the rich do not care about social issues. They are *above the law*.

Thus, they'll split your vote across parties (use one branch/party to set up the ball, and the other to knock it over) and use it against you, and you can't stop it.

You won't vote every single democrat out of office over something that profits corporations heinously (Dodd-Frank for major banks, or the rampant deficit spending for instance), just as republicans won't vote out every single republican for the same (NN or the current tax bill that bloats the deficit), it all gets rationalized away as 'well its bad, BUT the other side is worse'


It really doesn't matter if the one side is 5% worse, or even 25% 'worse'. 

I'd say Trump has done less damage to the nation than Obama and W Bush. That's an objective fact, maybe given him 3 more years and he can equal the 16 of those two, but for now, anything he's done can be undone within 30 seconds of another president. You just liked Obama. You hated W Bush. You now give it a pass because W Bush isn't up for election, but if he were, you'd say don't vote for him. You could have voted out Obama in 2012 for the spying on citizens, the drone strikes on citizens, expanding the war on terror, his refusal to close gitmo, or even just criticize him for his awfulness for things like the ACA which is a republican-crafted piece of legislation that has profited insurance companies to the tune of 400% increase in profits (2016) over 2010's average. What about the ignoring of the growing heroin issue? His never ending war on pot? Arming mexican cartels? 

Extreme support of the Patriot ACT? Unless you supported W Bush and thought he did great, no one can say Obama did anything different but was a better orator. I'm not even touching Obama's cronyism that was leaked out with Citigroup et al (I figure most presidents have to do this in some respect to get elected, but just saying he wasn't above it).

That's the problem. You. Not specifically YOU but this mindset. You're not fine with anything you don't like and you'll vote that way at the ballot box.

Thus, this will always, always happen. You must feel you are in control and voting for that control, just as republicans do. And the powerful bank on that.

Hence, Comcast owning the internet now. You still, to this day, do not believe Obama did anything 'wrong' to help Comcast....despite being the biggest recipient of donations and literally blocking last-mile unbundling (which is what everyone wants, not specifically net neutrality, but the ability to pick between 20-30 different companies who all lease the same line so that its harder to get away with scammy shit regardless of regulation).
$C: So, letting comcast and verizon, companies who rose to power using Title II regulatory protections, should be controlled under the same provision, that they don't care about?

How about we get more companies in it? Why are you SO against competition in the market?
$C: White isn't a culture. 
$C: Dude companies paid to build the wires. They own them. You have no right to regulate it. It's not a utility.
$C: And government has such a fucking great track record regulating shit huh? You people just love getting fucked by big daddy government.
$C: Most grad students do not make much money at all because often times, they work for universities or research facilities working on their graduate work or doctoral thesis. As such, most of their income is counted as a grant or scholarship, rather than them being paid by their institutions in standard wages. If that were to be taxed, they would owe far more than they actually earn as free income.
$C: The wonderful thing about the internet is that if you and Milo don't like Twitter, you can use other websites instead of whining like cucks about getting kicked off for breaking rules.
$C: lol net neutrality has nothing to do with whatever side you're on.  your ISP isn't checking your political affiliation when they decide you shouldn't be allowed to access whatever sites you use or that you should pay more on top of what you already pay, it's completely up to them.  nothing's stopping the big name ISPs from muscling out the competition either, and most of them have monopolies over internet service in the whole country.  so enjoy paying $5 extra a month for the conservative news package.
$C: The difference? I can excuse people from other GOP states somewhat because I believe their motivations are somewhat different. I'm sick and tired of Evangelicals jamming their religion in my face via hypocritical extremist messaging while double dealing in congress. I have less of an interest in, say, the fine people of Alaska. 

The double layer hypocrisy and holier-than-thou sweetness of the southern arm of the GOP is beyond bullshit and clear into unAmerican. 
$C: Look, I can't help if you willingly admit you're lying about knowing any of this stuff

$C: Minority or not, I will be on the winning side of the argument
$C: It's always amusing to follow-up on abject idiots like that guy.  Especially when he already created an alt to use as a shield to hide behind when venturing out of his safe-padded T_D chamber.

RIP u/ksedksedksed, the stereotypical spineless weanie T_Der who talked himself into a corner, then ran away and waited two weeks before deleting his account, just as predicted in my very first reply to him.  

>Guess you'll have to hide behind another new alt next time. Good luck.

Unfortunately for him, in anticipation of his cowardice, I had archived his stupidity.

Moron.

You're a fucking idiot mate, happy to treat others differently if they don't share your views or you dislike them.

And what about those Jews? Am I rite? Taking all our money, the majority of Germany dislikes them.. babies, fuck them, I know what we'll do..


$C: Because the local government didn't volunteer until after he annulled it. Local governments can pay what they want, just like you can donate as much (of your own) money as you want to whatever you want. The issue was that the US was financing everything. That's why he got out. I don't get how you're not understanding the difference between the US government being forced to commit $100 billion a year for decades, and people voluntarily giving away their own money. 
$C: Please, educate me. How does Net Neutrality relate to propaganda, shilling, and censorship.

And before you say it, an ISP filtering a website is not censorship since theoretically you can pick another ISP which does not filter it. Just like a "family friendly" filter isn't censorship. Censorship keeps getting thrown around for any case of perceived inconvenience for accessing something it has lost most of its meaning.
$C: I've updated my op and provide some poof. I can always find more. It isn't difficult. If you believe there are no shills on Reddit and that something funky isn't going on over at r/politics, I encourage you to look this topic up on a search engine and you will find several accounts from people and articles about it. 
$C: You think it's a rediciouls reason, so your want to deny our ability to do it because it's what you think?
$C: > You're a traitor, just like your president. I wish they hadn't changed the punishment for that.

too ez
$C: I think you might be an assclown......Assclown. 
$C: I'm talking about removing laws that make it extremely difficult and costly to start an ISP, including regulatory burdens, licensing, zoning and compliance.
$C: Ok. Your "argument" doesn't exist though. Go back to t_d.
$C: Someone hurt your feelings, eh?

Your lack of argument didn't deserve an argument back, you hoser.
$C: You're losing it dude. Might be the sleep deprivation.
$C: There's certainly some of that, and it's disgusting. But that's not nearly all or even most people. 
$C: I'm referring to this story I found out a while ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/6c5e97/eli5_how_were_isps_able_to_pocket_the_200_billion/

I don't pretend that government regulations help or increase competition in any way, I mean to say that some things shouldn't be left up to competition because it doesn't yield the best outcome. Some services need to be protected by other means than solely relying on the market to reward or punish companies not acting in the best interest of citizens and the long-term future of the local area, the country or the world.
$C: I mean if your own words are "incoherent" to you, maybe that's why you end up lying so much, because you don't even understand your own words
$C: >You're saying net neutrality hasn't been around since 2015?

Not even remotely close to what I said

>That is not correct. Net neutrality was preserved in 2015 under Title II. Your argument is hard to tackle only because of how removed from reality it is.

It's hard to tackle for you because you clearly didn't understand it in the slightest
$C: [deleted]
$C: Benefit by creating more service providers now which was deemed impossible by the Act. It takes away the regulation on which competition was built to form, albeit still no open internet provision (bad). And as far as I’m concerned, I’ve gone over it a bunch of times and as of now I’ll always lean right, and I’m registered independent btw. 
$C: >Sources Fox and CNN as legit sources

Sad, really
$C: Yes, I get that from you "pointing out my cringy drivel." It's almost like people with different perspectives are going to come out of a conversation with different opinions on how it went. You'll get it one of these days, I believe in you. 

Your reading comprehension needs some work as well. Nowhere did I call myself intelligent. I'm just smart enough, and know enough truly intelligent people, to know that I am squarely in the middle. I only pointed out that you, and the idiot you're so staunchly defending, appear to barely be able to cobble sentences together. The sentences you do manage to fart out generally contain purely ad hominem insults and opinions that are hardly based in reality, much less fact. I admit, I sank to your level with a couple of my comments, but that's because it's fun and I like it. 

Is that enough "calling you out on your bullshit?" Am I absolved of fear? Do you need more follow through? Also, the ultimate sign of fearing the continuation of a conversation is the premature "have a nice weekend." I'm sure you're used to being premature though, so I won't hold it against you. Lub u bby.
$C: Right on, I hear you man. Although, I recall Obama wanted a single payer solution but was forced to compromised because politix. I'm sure you'll say he was forced to compromise because of the massive lobbying effort by the health care industry. Sadly, their power is able to influence public opinion which influences the representatives and vice versa. And Obama needed congressional support.  
$C: Isn't that what you people say?
$C: Whereas companies don't pay for electricity cables and water pipes?



[You sure they paid for them? Im pretty sure US taxpayers paid for it and was then never given it due to false promises](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-kushnick/the-book-of-broken-promis_b_5839394.html)
$C: Muh no regulations, i suppose it's far better to be fucked by big daddy Comcast? Please tell me how it fucks the consumer at all to have all traffic be treated equally?

You're changing the goalposts pretty hard tho, adorable.
$C: Sure, it would suck IF it passes (and even then it wouldn't take effect until 2019-2020) but is it going to fuck them over, realistically, if they have to pay 2k~ more per year on average, assuming they can't get it or a large part of it written off? 

Sorry still missing the point where being shit scared about 2k per year than can be written off as something legitimate.
$C: Okay? Now that NN is gone Gab will be able to compete with them even more easily.

No one on the right is trying to force you to respect free speech, if censoring people you don't like somehow makes you feel better about yourself, then that's between you and your dead movement. Just seems to me that it's hypocritical compared to the rhetoric used to promote net neutrality. (I.e.: this thread)
$C: Sounds like projection because that's what *you* would do if you owned an ISP. Actual capitalists have morals.
$C: Still not linking shit, still shifting burden of proof onto someone else, still making shit up.

Good ol' Trump supporters. Man your country is fucked.
$C: You're dumb.  Statement.
$C: Well no, if the winning side is less consumer protections you'll lose too. Lose-lose for the dupes in this scenario unfortunately. I will be curious to see how all the lawsuits play out though. Fingers crossed! 
$C: God you *are* a cry baby.  Just telling it like it is.  Reddit isn't "resetting it to 0," the majority are telling t_d to piss off, but t_d can't take the hint and resorts to writing a fictional narrative to feel better about themselves.

But hey, good job deflecting away from your baseless accusation to be racist instead.  Guess you'll have to hide behind another new alt next time.  Good luck.
$C: Nobody forced the US to sign the deal? And the US is the richest country in the world, don't act like it's economy is in trouble.
$C: Okay, so to recap, this thread goes:

Original comment:
>[Was supporting net neutrality included in the $2.8 million you got for selling /r/politics?](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7jsyqt/the_fccs_vote_was_predictably_frustrating_but/dr8wrl5/)

>[Explain?](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7jsyqt/the_fccs_vote_was_predictably_frustrating_but/dr8ypwp/)

>[The mod team at r/politics was bought out for that total by the same.groups that run ShareBlue/Media Matters/etc. Essentially the DNC owns the sub now. They also use a bot army to downvote and hide any wrong think that their bougjt and paid for mods dont address.](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7jsyqt/the_fccs_vote_was_predictably_frustrating_but/dr8z960/)

>[Could you link us some proof or strong indication of this being true?](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7jsyqt/the_fccs_vote_was_predictably_frustrating_but/dr90381/)

Then you go:
>[Proof that there's shills on reddit or that the r/politics has been compromised? You could always investigate for yourself. Maybe even go there for a time and see how things are. Somehow I think no matter what proof I provide you with, it won't be enough to convince you.
Would you look at that. 2 posts in and I've already got a 10 minute post queue. It's almost as if people are in here downvoting like it's their job.](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7jsyqt/the_fccs_vote_was_predictably_frustrating_but/dr93nhx/)

Then you provide as proof 40 minutes worth of videos where they say shocking things like:

>[So do you think that the mods, at least in the r/politics sub are liberal-leaning, and the fact that the site is liberal-leaning and the comments are liberal leaning, do you think that's because of the mods and the way they direct the way they do their job or is it just because Reddit attracts liberal people?](https://youtu.be/ObhNFATlQ9s?t=2m50s)

>[No, I'll honestly vouch for those guys, bias is really checked at the door, we have a very long half-mod status to make sure that people are checking their bias at the door. If they're making some questionable calls we won't ever promote them to full mod and they'll very quickly no longer be a mod at all. And that's something we're keeping an eye out for.](https://youtu.be/ObhNFATlQ9s?t=2m50s)

Shocking. Really incriminating stuff. The rest of the videos and posts are about reddit and shills *as a whole*, including a video where they show that you can buy a post up to the front page. Cool. So the goal post has moved from:

**REDDIT SOLD R/POLITICS FOR $2.8 MILLION DOLLARS TO SHAREBLUE**

to

*Uh, we definitely have proof that shills exist, please just generate views on this youtube channel.*

Why do you bother?
$C: Like I said, feel free to revolt. Just don't be upset when your violence is met with violence by the state and they win with overwhelming force. Should a revolution spark, especially out of this, I stand with the US. I'm not going to stop you, that's not my job so I'm not denying you anything. If you want to form a well armed militia and die for your cause be my guest...
$C: I can practically taste your salt from here.
$C: Oh sorry I was talking about the laws that make it literally illegal to start one at all, not even getting as far as the ones you were talking about. (Getting rid of such laws is called regulation if you weren't aware)
$C: Most people also become hostile when presented with the harsh truth that they can't back up their position as well. Par for the course. I've stated earlier that I am not well versed in the issue, therefore I take a neutral position leaning towards my biases (my bias being that I prefer less regulation to more). So you're right, I don't have an argument, I'm not arguing anything. In a world filled with sound bites and misinformation I'm going to need a legitimate argument before I will be convinced that NN is ultimately a good or bad thing. 
$C: LOL. I'll get some sleep when you explain why the corporate tax cuts have no expiration date but the indivdual tax cuts do.

*Stick to the script! He's trying to catch you! Stick. To. The. Script!*
$C: So then maybe he's only responding to the shitheads?
$C: Things like what and why? If you’re saying that the free market isn’t the answer then there needs to be some demonstration that in practice the government solution is the better answer and not just because it fits some perceived notion of what should be “protected.”  That’s a dangerous way of thinking and leads to more and more things that are going to be labeled too big to fail or too important to leave to the free market or whatever.  There’s not absolutely perfect solution, but the but history of what you’re describing simply doesn’t support the idea.  It’s amazing that despite all the data that should convince otherwise that people still seem to argue these types of things. I’m not calling you arrogant,  but it’s certainly an arrogant way of thinking...that people need protecting by you or the government from big bad corporations even in today’s age of information.  Getting into bigotry of low expectations area.  People are smarter than most give them credit for, and in general just want to be left alone and allowed to make their own decisions.
$C: The thread you linked and the “money gab” is a result of governments involvement, not an argument in favor of it.  Why would those guys need to move quickly when they know they don’t have to compete with anyone?  I’ll use my google fiber example again...if Google Fiber could have built out their own infrastructure (which was what they tried to do - General Dynamics was going to be responsible for the construction) then they could have easily forced those big boys to spend the money where “it was supposed to go”...but instead they get a hand from the federal government and local governments that forced Google’s hand and prevented them from being able to compete which would have forced those guys to lower prices and built out and upgrade their own infrastructure.  I will say that prices did come down a little bit and Fiber or something close to it finally became available citywide here in Dallas, so something good did come of it....but I still pay about it 100 bucks a month for my Fiber.  Google as far as I understand would have been about half as much and probably a whole helluva lot better.
$C: [deleted]
$C: Regale me then, reddit genius.

Cause AFAIK net neutrality was somewhat of a grey area prior to 2015, with the FCC possessing regulative authority over such actions if it so chose, but after 2015 it was solidified.

Now it's being solidified in the other direction, ensuring the FCC is stripped of that consumer-protecting regulatory authority which saved us from those instances prior to 2015.

Please though, by all means, if you've got evidence to the contrary I'd be interested to read it.

EDIT: I worded "You're saying net neutrality hasn't been around since 2015?" poorly, I meant to say "You're saying net neutrality wasn't around until 2015?" 

With that in mind I'd be interested for you to address how your words, "The rules being repealed went into effect in 2015..." are not equivalent to "net neutrality didn't exist prior to 2015"
$C: > you also brought up that you've had the same views on society as i mentioned before, about work being monotonous and slavery.

I've never said. How many times you gonna put words in my mouth? 3? 4?

>you keep saying kys because you think you're proving a point that people arent actually feeling how they say they are, as if you know anything about them

You're missing the point. I never claim to read their minds. I claim to challenge them to kys, so they can see where their logic leads. It's all about the logic of anti-natalism and NOT YOUR FEELINGS.

> you think SUFFERING MAKES ME STRONGER!!1 I CAN GET THROUGH THOSE TOUGH TIMES!!! BECAUSE LIFE IS GOOD AND YOU CANT DISAGREE!!

Never said suffering makes you stronger. I said you can find positivity in it. You can disagree, I suggested material that counters common causes of anti-natalism. If you're just going to ignore the debate over the points I made, the underpinnings of anti-natalism and accuse me of tyranny, then I have already won. Thank you. Now fuck off.

> life situation =/= shitty mindset.

that's rich coming from you. unable to separate out opinion, philosophy, your feelings and what I'm talking about as separate things. the same argument applies. you don't know my mindset. so fuck off with your snarky "come back".

>still act like the idea that life is worth living is factual and not opinion.

How many times do I have to repeat there is philosophical debate here. You are literally just ignoring what I said. Straight up. Just not a shadow of doubt you are ignoring it.

>i cant tell what you're trying to say here.

**This is fundamentally your problem and has been the whole conversation.** You don't know what the fuck you are talking about. You just want to vent your shitty feelings on me. For the 4th or 5th time.

> im past the idea that life is meaningless. like, yeah, it is, but it doesnt stop people from enjoying their life. i just dont.

This is literally what I am talking about. Existentialism. You've ignored what I wrote. This is my criticism of ANTI-NATALISM. IT APPLIES TO YOU AND ANTI-NATALISTS. Go read up on it, cause I'm not wasting any more time on you.

>the guy that treats sex as a reason to live

I never actually said that. You are so desperate to grasp on to what you think my mindset is so you can grab the moral high ground, you completely miss the fact that I said that as a counter-argument to your post. I'm not actually pouring out my world view here to you. I'm only challenging the anti-natalist garbage you refuse to talk about, and keep bringing up your depression. GO GET HELP FROM A PROFESSIONAL AND NOT REDDIT. For FUCKS SAKE.

>im sorry buddy, you arent changing my opinion, just as im not changing yours.

This isn't Tit for Tat. If you got a point say it and if it's valid it will change my mind. Too bad everything you say is about yourself and too easily challenged.

>why the fuck would i give one flying shit what you think of my philosophy?

Because we are talking about anti-natalism. Good work making it all about you. You selfish. Little. Brat. Get a life.

>your jokes are as shit as your mindset. 

It's a taunt, not a joke. It's deliberately crass for the added insult. Learn social skills. Oh my mindset that you so completely know? Good work.

Guess I got you invested. Funny that. Keep venting your shit onto my page and maybe you'll ACTUALLY READ WHAT I WRITE. 

I'm disabling inbox replies, so goodbye.


$C: Do you actually think more service providers are likely?
$C: Stubbed toe, broken spine.. they're all the same really
$C: Well Obama is a great politician, but really he's an even better lawyer who has one of the best constitutional law minds in the nation and that includes his shifting stances/wordsmithing to make an argument for the moment (he's very careful never to be clear on anything so he can't hang himself with his own words later): http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/16/barack-obama/obama-statements-single-payer-have-changed-bit/

Honestly he's a great executive republican. Respectable on the surface, willing to dabble in cronyism to enrich his fellow rich industries (and in doing so, tie the industries to the US' best interests), and willing to start wars and have folks straight up murdered who fuck with him. You DO need these guys every 8-16 years to come in and drag the world around by the political balls to remind them you're in charge as a super power.

I just didn't think we needed 16 years of it. I'd rather have Obama in 00'-08 and someone else in 08-16.


But as to why we're in this miss:
I don't think folks realize some things - the desire for 'government help' (aka free shit, not actual democratic control of capital - which is a nightmare itself - whether is medicare, social security, housing loan subsidies, free college, energy subsidies, corn subsidies, etc) in a democratic government is pretty much begging the rich to take over, because it comes from them and the rich folks always have major strings attached.

That's the thing no one mentions on the left or the right. The right ignores how much 'socialism' it engages in (subsidies, tax breaks, 'workfare', medicare, social security) and the left refuses to acknowledge socialism (in all forms) is admitting the rich are too powerful and the common person can't live a 2017 lifestyle without serious government intervention that relies on taxation on the rich (top 1% pays over 30% of taxes in the US, top 25% almost all of it). This means the top 25% of the US basically have 99% of the power because they can threaten to leave, pull funding, divert their increasing wealth to defeat incumbent candidates, etc.


And no one is willing to "ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country" and essentially take the burden back on themselves to wrest the power back. Everyone (and I'm including small businesses and large, unprofitable industries too) is too busy putting their hand out and demanding.


So anyone in a position of earning more than the average for whatever they are (person, corporation, etc) becomes the new unmovable pillar. You can see it in Europe where the same wealthy have been so since the 1700s (though there's some autocrat leftover stuff that helped this, of course, some nations are kingdoms where the crown owns most things still in name and is leased to people for 99 years).


And that's why you're seeing the technocrats move in, as tech is replacing the oil and farming giants. What's worse, is the oil and farming giants had to give a shit about the US because they are land dependent.

Guess what billionaire industries don't have to care and provide their services anywhere? Wait till Zuckerberg is your next president. You think Trump is bad? 


A society is only as democratic as the bottom 80%s ability to earn capital. And the only way they can do that is via working jobs that add real value to society and starting their own enterprises. You can tell which those are because its the ones that pay more than they get (or are net neutral).

As long as a majority of this nation gets more than it pays, the power will continue to rest with the top 1%. And with them, the next 29% because they don't want to end up like the remaining 70%.

And that's the problem you're seeing here. You have no voice because you have no economic sway. It's really as 'simple' as that. Fixing it is even harder because no one wants to hear it. You have to wait for the crash, the suffering, and then folks will start relying on themselves again and take more of the power back for a temp period, until this happens again.


Just look at the last 100 years of US history if you want an example of this. I hope I'm totally wrong and history doesn't repeat itself.
$C: What's white culture?

Is it exactly the same from Milwaukee to Moscow?

$C: if they have to pay even a 20% tax on a say 60k grant, with upwards of 40k in tuition, that would leave them with 12k of their 20k real income gone. instead of the 20k getting taxed, the money that they pay the school gets taxed too.

And I remind you, that they receive this grant in exchange for their work in research or whatever relevant field. They are working a job. So, its not like they can just get another job while working full time AND trying to achieve whatever education degree they are seeking. Not reasonably, anyway.

Edit: and that's a LOW estimate on the price of their education. My college (Illinois Institute of Technology) cost over 30k per SEMESTER, if my 25k a year scholarship was taxed that would have been devastating.
$C: Good luck accessing Gab when Twitter pays your ISP to throttle all traffic to Gab and other competitors in the post-NN world.

You have the right to harass people online, but that doesn't mean you're safe from the repercussions of doing so.  It's pretty damn petty to want NN repealed just because Twitter won't stand up for its users targeting and harassing someone, which, again, has nothing to do with net neutrality.
$C: Until you discover Comcast and other gigantic telecom companies were pushing for repealing net neutrality for exactly that scenario I just outlined.  
$C: Great job market, no more tpp, record high stock market, 100+ billion in debt reduced, 3 trillion saved from exiting the Paris accords, skyrocketing retirement plans, lowest regulations since 2004

$C: Oh my god. You realise that the 'racist' example (lol wtf is racist about it?) was mocking you right? Course you don't, you're an idiot. Because it's literally the exact thing you're doing. Discriminating against people and using their 'crimes' to justify it.
$C: So what? Just because Americans work harder and create more wealth they have to support everyone else? Fuck that. Nothing's preventing India or China getting its shit together. 
$C: I never said "REDDIT SOLD R/POLITICS FOR $2.8 MILLION DOLLARS TO SHAREBLUE" please look again. I said it would make sense. What I did claim is that the sub has been compromised. Whether it's shills and bots pushing a clear pro-establishment narrative with vote manipulation/brigading, or mods knowing and allowing this fuckery to continue or worse, being involved in it and abusing ban/post removals. 

Oh, you've got 275 posts in /r/EnoughTrumpSpam. I'm not a Trump supporters, but that explains a lot. I don't know how you can see all that I linked and shrug it off. I mean there's more out there, but like I said in my op, just about no amount of evidence is going to change your mind, especially not if you aren't allowed to agree with me. 
$C: How am I salty? Trump is president and net neutrality got nuked. Today has been a good day.
$C: I wasn't aware. In fact, I'm still not sure I believe you. That sounds like you're either being an extremely pedantic troll, or you're just making up definitions for words.

Whatever the case, the point is that reduced limits on competitive entrants to the ISP market are what we need, whether they be removal of laws, removal of regulations, application of regulations that remove laws etc.

$C: If people are needing 100k for their education per year, they're pursuing a high paying career that they're MOST LIKELY taking out loans for, as well. 

Once again I fail to see how this "fucks" someone over. Is it an incovenience, if it passes and comes into effect in 1-3 years, sure? Is it something worth being "Scared" over? Not unless literally everything scares you.

We're talking about an area where people take upwards of 250k if not way more in loans and you're trying to excuse him being "scared' by potentially having to pay more, if he somehow can't get it written off? You should now see why it's a pretty good joke. 
$C: >Good luck accessing Gab when Twitter pays your ISP to throttle all traffic to Gab and other competitors in the post-NN world.

Citation needed.

>You have the right to harass people online, but that doesn't mean you're safe from the repercussions of doing so. 

Harassment has a legal definition. If someone wasn't convicted in a court of law of harassment, then it isn't harassment; you're simply using buzzwords to justify your ideological censorship.

>It's pretty damn petty to want NN repealed just because Twitter won't stand up for its users targeting and harassing someone, which, again, has nothing to do with net neutrality.

It's because I don't believe in corporate handouts, especially when the corporations in question are a threat to my freedoms. Fuuuuck that shiiiit.
$C: You wish. If that were true why would you support NN?
$C: What, am I pinning you down lying about one thing, so you've gotta move onto more?
$C: Oh no, the guy who's been insulting since the beginning doesn't like being called dumb!
$C: Haha yes, that's one battle you could probably win. When you're so easily dupeable, you gotta find ways to feel like you're winning I guess. Thanks for the chat bro, apologies that I embarrassed you... 
$C: Yes, I know you're trying to deflect with some dumbshit attempt to compare your actions and behavior to racism in a transparently pathetic attempt to attack my character with more fiction, rather than address the facts.  It's a T_Ders MO to use diversion and deflection when you run out of bullshit.

You're just like Moore's spokesman right now.  Staring blankly with your mouthbreathing maw open as you try to weasel out of your own idiotic statement that has no basis in truth, and then shout out nonsense that has no relation to the point being made.

**Most of the Reddit doesn't like you.  Get over it, princess.**  Clearly from you repeating the constant fiction of "hurr durr, Reddit must be setting it to 0!!! yes, that will make me feel better about myself!" you still haven't accepted the simple truth:  when T_D is exposed to the millions of redditors on r/all, they down vote you.

Do you have anything to actually say about T_D threads getting downvoted by the reddit masses on r/all, or you going to deflect like a coward again?
$C: Because Americans pollute harder than almost every other person on earth (except for some gulf states) they have to pay more. Also since they have more wealth they have more capacity to, you know, stop a global catastophy from happening. The west pollutes more and earns more per capita. You're being intellectually dishonest if you don't see this. Who has more means to invest in clean energy? The high tech country with self driving cars or the country full of poverty stricken farmers?

But still, why would trump annull an Accord even though he knew the annulment would make no difference? Since you keep evading the question, let me give you my hot take. He did this to make a point to his voter base that he doesn't give a shit about the future of the planet. His voters like this, they want someone who puts America's interests over the long term interests of the human race.

I'm Dutch. I don't give a shit about internal us politics. Just matters that concern the world outside of the US. He hasn't started any wars, but he is breaking up any hope for combatting climate change. My country is about as rich as the US but emits 50% less per capita, it's not like you can't be rich and pollute less.
$C: The landscape is already changing in congress with the special election. Your bad days are bigly close. Just wait.
$C: But they aren't though. It's becoming increasingly clear that Comcast, and other Telecom companies are trying to scam the consumer. There is no reason for companies freedom to be a priority over individual freedom

It's a Twitter feud, not a civil lawsuit.  I think you need to get over Twitter not wanting that shit on their website.

If you don't support corporate handouts, then why do you support repealing net neutrality?  It's a fucking *huge* handout to telecom corporations.

We're already paying more to reduce the pollution. [Here are the CO2 emissions by country.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions) As you can tell both China's and India's populations play a huge role. 

[Here's the pollution index.](https://www.numbeo.com/pollution/rankings_by_country.jsp) America is 75th. 

We produce pollution, and we get rid of it. That's why the US isn't full of garbage, has plenty of fresh air, etc. 

> Also since they have more wealth they have more capacity to, you know, stop a global catastophy from happening. 

And because of wealth (generated by its people) its America's responsibility to care for everyone in the world? We're not the "grown ups" here, they can take responsibility for their own bullshit. 

>The west pollutes more and earns more per capita. You're being intellectually dishonest if you don't see this. Who has more means to invest in clean energy? The high tech country with self driving cars or the country full of poverty stricken farmers?

We don't need the Paris Accord to invest in greener technology. We also have the best people in the world when it comes to developing new technologies. So why send all of that money overseas? 

>But still, why would trump annull an Accord even though he knew the annulment would make no difference? Since you keep evading the question, let me give you my hot take.

>I'm Dutch. I don't give a shit about internal us politics.

The EU is not only wealthier than the US, but they work less, and have far better programs. Maybe it's time the EU start putting their money where their mouth is? $100 billion a year shouldn't be too much to ask for from the entire union. Hell if you really believe so much in it, why not hand $200 or even $300 billion a year over to China and India, and have zero expectations of them changing for the better? You're free to do with your own money as you like, I'm not going to sit here and chastise you about what's good for everyone else. 
$C: Roy Moore? I was glad about that. Bannon needed his power level removed, I mean the guy can't even dress and he thought Milo was a winning move.

In the long term having the right win too much will be a disaster because people won't go far enough. We need to keep the hate alive for a cleansing unlike anything seen in human history.

$C: >/all and other algorithms were changed specifically to keep T_D off the front page. Thread counts being reset to 0. Stickies from T_D not allowed on /all. 

You were speaking in the context of r/all.  Then you spent 2 replies specifically attempting to avoid the topic, and then only when explicitly called out on it and backed into a corner, you suddenly "clarify."  Yeah, okay buddy, backpedal harder.  PS:  Non-T_Ders can still go and downvote threads in T_D.  You still have absolutely zero proof that the reddit administration is "resetting threads to 0."

Do you actually have proof, or you just full of shit?  You still haven't actually added *anything at all.*
$C: I don't get you. First you say entire countries should pull themselves up by their bootstraps, then you say shit's not fair because the EU is richer. Why doesn't the US just step up and get richer? We are not richer than the US btw, just compare gdp per capita.

And we are putting our money where our mouth is, we are not the ones canceling the Paris agreement.

It is the responsibility of the richest of the world to make sure that we don't kill our planet.

Oh and you're right, I used pollution when I meant the word emissions. 
$C: Something we agree on. We DEFINITELY need a cleansing.
$C: [deleted]
$C: That sounds wrong, seeing as Google was for net neutrality and that they were allowed to enter the market, just that they couldn't effectively expand. Do you mind citing the rule you're referring to? I looked and can't find anything that would not allow entry
$C: You can dismiss any source you disagree with, bub.

The point is by hitching your wagon to Trump, you've already shown how little regard you have for truth or facts, so you kinda abdicate any skeptical high ground you might have had in dismissing sources, be they CNN or Fox.

This is why you might as well go chase pizza.
$C: Not an argument.
$C: Remember when 'a bug' caused only T_D to hit the front page? With 0 counts? Admins said it was 'a fault in the database' or something? That just happened to only affect T_D? Pepperidge farm remembers.

https://imgur.com/a/qP90b

Remember before said bug, before the algorithm of /all was changed? T_D was often a few threads deep - remember seeing any at 0? No.

https://archive.is/Qe8KB

Why was the alogrithm changed? Apparently because T_D actively chose to flood the frontpage of /all right? So if they were flooding the frontpage, but were then always downvoted to 0, they'd drop off the frontpage - so there'd be no need for the algorithm change in the first place.
$C: >I don't get you. First you say entire countries should pull themselves up by their bootstraps

I said nothing of the sort. I said countries should be responsible for their own pollution/garbage.

> then you say shit's not fair because the EU is richer. Why doesn't the US just step up and get richer? We are not richer than the US btw, just compare gdp per capita.

You're in the EU. EU has a bigger economy than the US. Your argument was that because the US was rich it should pay for everything around the world. We already maintain peace around the world, protect the EU from Russia, etc. If you truly believe that the rich should foot the bill for everything, then back it up with action instead of words. The EU has just as much money they can throw around as the US. 

>We are not richer than the US btw, just compare gdp per capita.

Western EU sure is. But again, what else is the EU doing that's on par with the US? Science, tech, medical, etc research is not even comparable. Maybe stop slacking off and taking so much time off work? But never mind that, because Americans work more hours, take less time off, fewer vacations, etc, we have to use that extra money to pay for everyone else? No thanks. I don't bust my ass 14 hours a day so I can go fund someone else and make the socialists in the EU happy. You want it, you do it yourself. 

>It is the responsibility of the richest of the world to make sure that we don't kill our planet.

Since when? Again, the US doesn't benefit from Asia fucking up the oceans and their entire echo system. I haven't seen a penny from that. In fact, I'd much rather we move all US production back to the US where we have better pollution standards, and we won't have to ship everything across the planet. 

The countries that pollute need to take responsibility for what they're doing. And if the governments don't feel like making changes, maybe we should put some trade embargo's on them. 

If what say/believe is so important, then get your own government to finance it. Don't "volunteer" someone else to do it for you. 
$C: Agreed, the games have started up but have slowed down, can't wait until they get hotter again.

Well duh I'm presenting such things that you've said 

You're not good at this whole "rational thought" thing, huh sport
$C: I wouldn’t necessarily say”preventing entry” more along the lines of meeting their guidelines (vague and subjective). “And the FCC specifically has proposed to eliminate the vague "general Internet conduct standard," which gives the FCC far-reaching discretion to prohibit any ISP practice that it believes runs afoul of a long and incomplete list of factors.”
$C: So Fox, CNN and Politifact

Any other amazing news sources you'd like to reference as totally reliable and not at all biased?

Perhaps https://www.Democrats.org/? https://www.GOP.com/?
$C: You're learning.
$C: So all you have an old, isolated incident, which wasn't secret, to "prove" that **current** threads are being randomly "reset to 0?"

Do... do you not actually know how to actually prove a premise?  Go on, pick a current thread in T_D sitting at zero and prove reddit just "reset it to 0."  You know, your actual claim, not "hey one day in the past this error happened..."

E:  Since you like to edit in whole sections later.

Algorithm change != setting T_D posts to 0.  You're just trying to punt the goal posts around, yet again.

$C: Define hotter. This oughta be good. Chances are you're too ashamed of your own thoughts to write them out though.
$C: So there was never a rule that prevented entry? Then how can you think that more will enter now? And why would a general rule allowing regulation  (which again is the entire point of this) be a bad thing? 
$C: Why don't you give me an example of a source you consider reliable?


$C: Current threads? Lol at you moving the goalposts like a lame.

5 mins ago it was 'nuh uh didnt happen' now it's 'one isolated incident? Show me it with current threads!'

What a clown.
$C: I don't need to define anything. However, I can link to you something to perfectly explain everything as fair as possible:

https://www.cnet.com/news/reddit-facebook-bans-neo-nazi-groups-charlottesville-attack/

See the image of the reddit post?

That's me.
$C: Because now there’s less regulation, which opens borders. 
$C: I'll give you a hint:

CNN, Fox, Politifact, Democrats.org and GOP.com aren't on it

*SHOCKING*, I know
$C: Ah yes, the old fall back of the hypocrisy of a T_Der.  Point that finger of goalpost shifting up your own ass where it belongs, dumbass. *You're* the one that made the claim that "reddit is setting threads to 0."  This is yet again you just falling back to your intellectually bankrupt tactic of being evasive because you can't actually prove an idiotic statement you made.

You're also a grossly dishonest liar.  I didn't say that one isolated incident "didn't happen."  I even said it wasn't secret.

Per your claim, prove that right now, threads in T_D are getting "reset to 0 by reddit."  You've had plenty of opportunity.  Make an excuse or deflect and we can all take it as tacit admission that you're just full of shit and are not capable of proving it.  Not that you care about facts.  You clearly don't.
$C: You win. I'm ashamed of even honoring you with responses now. You'll get no more from me.
$C: But that's just not true. If there was nothing preventing entry than getting rid of additional regulation does nothing. Getting rid of regulation because it's regulation is beyond stupid. The reason people don't enter the market is entry costs. You can get to that conclusion easily yourself, read up on natural monopolies and when the free market fails. Clearly the repeal of these rules hurts consumers without helping anyone. 
$C: And it is?
$C: > /all and other algorithms were changed specifically to keep T_D off the front page. Thread counts being reset to 0. Stickies from T_D not allowed on /all.

That was what I said. You even quoted it yourself.

See the word 'were'? That is past tense. Do you understand past and present tense? You clearly don't.

First you were saying that editing comments and fucking with algorithms was fine if it's against people you don't like. Then when I point out that it's the same thinking of Nazi Germany you call me  racist (lol) and then say there's no proof. Then when I provide proof it happened you suddenly forget how the English language works and we're onto 'prove it is happening right now'.

Give it up dude, you're a mong.



$C: > Per your claim, prove that right now, threads in T_D are getting "reset to 0 by reddit." 

Also, if there's no threads on 0 now, then what does that tell you dude? It tells you that your stupid claim that any T_D thread that hit's /all frontpage gets downvoted and that is why it is viewable on /all as 0 isn't true. Because it's not happening is it? Why is that? Why are no T_D threads hitting /all and the frontpage then being downvoted to 0?
$C: I hope her mother read that comment. There's a very real possibility that she did.
$C: I gave you a hint

Do I have to force feed you or what
$C: Backpedaling and goalpost shifting again.  Funny, you didn't bother "clarifying" "once in past, this one time, during an obvious bug that was announced."  But now you're redefining your position again.  Because your position is indefensible.

Got it, you're full of shit.

>First you were saying that editing comments and fucking with algorithms was fine if it's against people you don't like. 

LMAO, were you trying to make yourself look like more of a dishonest shitheel that can't "win" an argument with out making things up, whole cloth?  Because you're doing a great job claiming I said things I never said.  Not only did I never say that, the first thing I said was:

>:psst: That's just everyone letting you know you're a bunch of insufferable assholes, and showing you the door.

Clearly you cannot prove your position, so you'll just change it, and then outright lie.  I'll let your blatant dishonesty and stupidity stand for itself.  Just what I've come to expect from a spineless T_Der:  hypocrisy, dishonesty, and no integrity while making claims that can't be backed up.  If you don't want reddit to see T_D as idiotic, insufferable assholes, that they downvote when they hit r/all, you should stop perpetuating the stereotype.
$C: So now you're trying to argue that your lack of evidence proves your point?  LMAO.    How does it fit your claims that threads are "reset to 0" if none are at zero?  You didn't think this through, did you?  You just openly acknowledged that threads don't get reset to 0.

Fucking moron.
$C: Well there's really no need to be coy about it, if you have a source that you consider reliable and unbiased, I would've thought you'd be proclaiming it loud and clear. So go ahead and force feed, what's your source?
$C: > [:psst: That's just everyone letting you know you're a bunch of insufferable assholes, and showing you the door.](http://svdp-annefrank-2013.wikispaces.com/file/view/train3.jpg/406966492/train3.jpg)

Here's a tip: 

Avoid the literal most biased places possible (AKA anything you've provided here)
$C: We already know you have no valid argument, princess.  There's no need to keep reiterating you're incapable of rational thought while you cry about it.  Grow a spine or stop behaving like an abject idiot.
$C: You already attempted that back pedaling.  Any person with 2 brain cells making that argument would've clarified that on the first reply, not dance and weasel around it, then make one "clarification" that failed to mention that "one time."  Let's also not forget what you responded to:

>I see the_donald on /r/all frequently, i don't know why people keep saying this.

Your response to that was:

>/all and other algorithms were changed specifically to keep T_D off the front page. Thread counts being reset to 0. Stickies from T_D not allowed on /all. 

So now you're claiming you intentionally made an irrelevant reply about a singluar past event that had nothing to do with T_D not being on r/all, presently.  Looks like you're having trouble keeping your web of falsehoods and lies straight; contradictions and plot holes are showing.

On point:  more deflecting and evading and arguing about arguing and goalpost shifting.  Keep dancing, jester, you're the dancing fool and I find it entertaining to watch you make a bigger fool of yourself.

E: fix some words

Why are no T_D threads hitting /all and the frontpage then being downvoted to 0?

Here, dickhead - let's start from the beginning.

I'm discussing spez fucking with T_D. You read this :

> /all and other algorithms were changed specifically to keep T_D off the front page. Thread counts being reset to 0. Stickies from T_D not allowed on /all.

Then decided to take this bit :

> Thread counts being reset to 0.

and reply :

> :psst: That's just everyone letting you know you're a bunch of insufferable assholes, and showing you the door. So you want exposure to r/all, and then cry like a bitch when you don't get the response you want? Go cry in your safe space about it that you're disliked by the majority. Baby.

Here you seem to think that I'm referring to threads getting downvoted to 0 by /all and you say 'that's because you're assholes' yadda yadda yadda.

First of all, my whole sentence was about changes by admin. Fuck all to do with people downvoting. The entire topic was spez abusing his power right?

So you, being a moron, pick one piece and somehow think I'm talking about just getting downvoted to 0? What? Or is that just your excuse for it? Like 'achkchully no, spez didnt do anything, it's just people downvoting to 0 because ur dum dums'

I say no, they were set to 0.

You say - provide proof. I show screenshots of the 'bug' as well as /all before any bugs or changes.

You say - show it's happening now.

Now listen close - **if it was happening now, that would mean that yes, it is people downvoting threads to 0 like you say. IT'S NOT HAPPENING NOW YOU FUCKING CRETIN. So it is not people downvoting is it?**





$C: You're like a fountain of bad sources

Sad, really
$C: Oh man, your reading comprehension gets worse with each reply you make in a fit of rage.  How precious.  The line you just quoted... perhaps you should actually read it.

No where did I say "all threads of T_D get downvoted to 0."  Once again, you are lying and making shit up to "win" an argument.  Pathetic.  What I did *imply* in the line above is that in threads that *do go to zero after reaching r/all,* it's not because "reddit reset it," but because it was downvoted.  Additionally, I only ever said that the front page of reddit downvotes T_D, nothing more.  Oops!  You're a dumbfuck.

PS:  This is still a deflection.  You're the one that made a claim; I merely provided the reality of what happens to T_D threads that reach r/all and hit 0, not that "all T_D threads that hit r/all get downvoted to 0."  But you know, as I already pointed out before; lies, dishonestly, and intellectual bankruptcy are the only tools you possess.
$C: Oh how amusing, you're going to continue doubling down on your back pedaling.  Let's pretend you're telling the truth though.  You just argued that you're incoherent, incompetent, and incapable of basic communication.  Congratulations.

First, you removed the context of your statement in your attempt to retroactively change the meaning.  The other guy was clearly making the argument that presently, t_d still makes it to r/all:

>I see the_donald on /r/all frequently, i don't know why people keep saying this.

This is what you responded to.  In the context of this argument, claiming that you were really referring to a specific one time event that wasn't secret or intentional, is *completely incoherent and irrelevant.*  What in the world does something that happened once, many months ago, have to do with t_d appearing on r/all frequently, now?  Absolutely nothing.  Sorry I presumed you were making a relevant response.

Second, your multiple meandering and blathering replies make no sense if that's what you really meant.  You danced around even answering for multiple replies, then spent yet another half dozen replies or so before suddenly shouting that you "really" were referring to that one time that there was a bug.  If that's what you meant, to which my initial reply wouldn't make sense, why would you dance around answering for so long instead of just saying exactly what you meant?  Are you just grossly incompetent and incapable of saying what you mean?  What kind of moron are you that you would make yourself look to be evasive and incapable of making a coherent reply instead of just clarifying what you meant?  And then you shout at me for your inability to state your point clearly.  Ok.

So you're either a completely incompetent idiot that can't communicate clearly, or you're back pedaling instead of admitting you were full of shit.  The second is the most likely, but you put so much effort into arguing that the first scenario is the proper one, I guess I'll have to agree that you're just an incoherent moron that can't communicate.

This says nothing of your multiple outright lies and attempts to invent things I never remotely said.  Every time I called you out on your lies, you just glazed over it like it never happened.  You've proven that more than anything, you will use dishonesty and lies in a pathetic attempt to "win" more than making a legitimate argument.

Finally, none of this invalidates what I've pointed out:  reddit isn't manipulating votes to keep t_d off the front page, and the reddit user base doesn't like you.

Do continue with your desperate spinning webs of lies, though.  I'll just keep giving you more rope as long as you're willing to keep taking it.

E: fix words
$C: Literally all you need to do to avoid looking like an utter dunce here is name one source that you consider reliable and unbiased. I don't even need to agree with it. 

I'm genuinely rooting for you here, guy. Don't let me down. I'm sure there's plenty. You just need one.
$C: Sorry sport, you'll have to grow up and find information yourself

Here's a tip: 

Avoid the literal most biased places possible (*AKA anything you've provided here*)
$C: Just one. You can do it.
$C: Just avoid literally every source you've read in the past

You're likely to hit something good
$C: And a good example would be...
$C: *avoid literally every source you've read in the past*
$C: avoidliterallyeveryourceyouvereadinthepast.com 404s

You got anything else? It doesn't even need to be your best or your favourite or anything like that. Just open up your browser history and pick a random source of news that you've found even moderately trustworthy.
$C: > avoidliterallyeveryourceyouvereadinthepast.com 404s

Still a better source than CNN
$C: Just one, buddy. C'mon. No point dismissing even CNN or Fox if you can't yourself cite anything better.
$C: Sorry you don't have any reliable sources, sport
$C: I'll even go first: The BBC. Definitely more reliable than both Fox or CNN.

Now you need to choose one. Because it's starting to seem like you just don't have any, and are instead relying on your independent pizza research.
$C: Whiff
$C: http://whiff.com/

I mean, it seems like it might be a reliable source of perfume information one day, although I suspect they've got a vested interest in making money off their perfume, whereas the BBC for example is publicly funded. I even question whether it's actually a news source at all, and in any case, doesn't appear to have launched yet?

Nothing else? george-soros-secret-jew-kill-network-exposed.com? alexjonesbrainfartz.tv?

Literally just one is needed to surprise me and show that my assumptions about you were inaccurate. One source. I believe, Oh Lord, I believe. Here it comes. He's gonna do it.
$C: Sorry you don't have any reliable sources, sport
$C: Alright, I'll go with another one while you think: The Economist.

Now, your turn. This is a super easy game. I know you can do it. One news source that you personally would consider reliable.
$C: Whiff
$C: So right now CNN is still more reliable than any source you've provided. Even if we agree that it's unreliable, we'll need to default to it as the victor in the absence of anything you can provide....

You're on the canvas. The 10 count is coming. Fucking *CNN* is strutting around with its gloves in the air. Don't let it end like this man, I'm cheering from your corner... Let's GO!
$C: Sorry you don't have any reliable sources, sport
$C: Ah, not a bang but a whimper.

It's been fun, ya little scamp. God knows I love playing with my food, especially when it's pizza. :*
$C: Sorry you get all your news from democrats.org
