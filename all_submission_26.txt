I found a bunch of fake cameras at Goodwill

$C: That chain of command in the last one. The supervisor watching the supervisor watching the supervisor watching the guy who does all the work. 
$C: I also have a gun, a picture of a sloth in an anstronaut suit, hundreds of dollars in cash and Christmas candles on my hallway shrine too.
$C: Is that a cut out of the "When Life gives you lemons" guy?

Also, are you the "When Life gives you lemons" guy?

Edit: [Here's the video I am referring to.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-RE7RUzjf8&feature=youtu.be)
$C: [deleted]
$C: This gif just keeps on getting better 
$C: Can we forget about the cameras for a moment and discuss the sloth and firearm shrine at the top of his stairs?  

$C: bold move showing your face in that mirror wearing that hat
$C: These seem like a joke, run a little wire from the back side and it really does deter people from doing bad things. I worked in a shop where we had three fake cameras and  people paid attention to them. 
It's almost like people don't want to be seen on camera looking to see if the camera is real?
$C: Change your toilet paper, you psycho!
$C: They just sold them as ‚Äú fake cameras‚Äù. Now they are watching you...
$C: I used to have a somewhat realistic-looking dummy CCTV security camera and when my friend and I moved into a house together, we thought it would be funny to put it in the bathroom facing the toilet. When we first moved in, we had a lot of parties and everyone would nervously ask about the camera in the bathroom. ‚ÄúThat camera, in the bathroom, you know? That‚Äôs... That‚Äôs fake, right?‚Äù When told it was a joke, that it was fake, everyone thought it was funny. Even though we had to physically prove to a few girls that it was fake, they found it funny. But one girl (who was like a friend of a friend of a friend), despite being told by everyone it was just a running joke and everyone knew it was fake, didn‚Äôt find it funny and somehow managed to rip it off the wall. I don‚Äôt know if she jumped or threw a towel over it and yanked it down, because it was pretty high up, but she managed to destroy the wall and the ‚Äúcamera‚Äù in the process and ended that joke pretty quick. 
$C: I'd enjoy being roommates with this person for a while
$C: The kitchen cupboard one would freak me out because I'd definitely be drunk sleeping over on someone's couch and then wake up in the middle of the night to steal snacks and think to myself I got caught red handed by his huge ass cupboard camera. 
$C: I wanted to get about 30 of those and do them all on the wall facing the toilet, just to really weird out my friends. 
$C: It would be funny to set these up in a public bathroom and then film the reaction of people leaving the room.
$C: Trying to figure out who used all the TP and didn't put a new roll on.  I'd resort to extreme measures too.  
$C: I‚Äôm watching you watching him watching the frog
$C: The camera pointed at the camera pointed at the camera is brilliant. 
$C: The ones with the stuffed-up frog had me dying
$C: Every turn another bizarre thing showed up. Nice 
$C: Gets lucky and brings home a date, they need to use the restroom.
‚ÄúUh there‚Äôs a camera in your bathroom! Wtf?!‚Äù
You: ‚Äúoh don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs fake, I promise‚Äù
$C: I used to work in a public library in the YA world. We had a collection of various magazines of interest to teens back in their area, but they kept getting stolen. I bought a fake bubble-style camera for like $4 and stuck it to the ceiling facing that corner. I also put up a little "smile, you're on camera" sign. Theft stopped!

After I quit and got a new job, someone who was still at the library told me that the camera lost its stickiness and fell off while some teens were back there, so the ~~gig~~ jig was up.
$C: This is the kind of shit I hope to find when I boot up the internet each new day. Top notch mate. 
$C: The three cameras on the wall reminded me of metal gear solid stairs area.
! ! ! PFFT PFFT PFFFFT
$C: there are so many fake camera's on Amazon! time to start stocking up for April Fools day. 
$C: Cameras covering the utmost important parts of one's home, the cereal cabinet, toilet, and pet sloth shrine.
$C: One camera, two camera,

Three camera, more!

I bought some cameras,

From the Goodwill store.

One for the shrine,

And one for the loo,

Now I can watch you,

While you're taking a poo!

Now, don't get all fussy,

And don't raise a shout.

These cameras are fake,

So stop freaking out!

I don't have many friends,

Like these people eating [shawarma](https://youtu.be/EYiZeszLosE?t=30),

So I made up this post,

Just to pull in some karma!


$C: 101k? Reddit baffles me. 
$C: Where is the fedora cabinet?
$C: I need some of these for my sloth/gun shrine
$C: We had this ‚Äúhandyman‚Äù at one of my old jobs, my workmate and I found an old fake camera so we jimmied up an LED with a 9V battery and installed this thing above his work bench.

He went from doing zero work every day to the hardest worker in the factory.

This lasted all of 6 hours until our boss came in laughing his head off and told us off for being fuckwits.

Totally worth it
$C: This looks like it was made to be as cringey and funny as possible. Well done. 
$C: I think your home qualifies as a modern art exhibit.  
$C: Where can I buy this exact model of fake camera?
$C: So nobody gonna talk about the scumbag who left the empty toilet paper roll there?
$C: You‚Äôre a funny guy.
$C: I like the look.
$C: Camera on Camera action. 
$C: When life gives you cameras.
$C: MotionPi them
$C: Now invite the local church group over for some tea and mention your hobby is on-line videos
$C: A camera,

**watching a camera,**

***Watching A CAMERA!!***
$C: Quite possibly the best thing I‚Äôve ever seen on the internet. I keep watching it over and over to find new little nuggets of awesomeness.
$C: Public restrooms 
$C: CHAFF grenade. 
$C: What‚Äôs it worth putting all those holes in your walls?
$C: /r/justneckbeardthings 
$C: I feel like they are looking at me like the Pixar lamp 
$C: Can we get a better picture of the sloth shrine?
$C: You‚Äôre out of TP. 
$C: This reminds me of my favorite quote from mgs1, "!"
$C: Fake cameras are best for filming fake news
$C: This will certainly deter whoever is failing to replenish the toilet paper at that commode.
$C: You are out of toilet papers yo.
$C: I like the "Watch my/your daughter pee cam" 

/s
$C: I especially like the one in the cupboard. I need to get one and focus it on thr peanut butter jar. For some reason after only a couple days they are empty :((( 
$C: Horrifying. No toilet paper left on the roll.
$C: I'd do some questionable things to meet you in person.

$C: The most important thing to ask: Is the thinmint cookie cereal any good?
$C: That is one meme-filled house lmao 
$C: Oh god a fedora 
$C: Am I allowed to post my Snapchat?
$C: Where is the funny part? 
$C: this guy narwhals the bacon , so random xdddddddddddddd
$C: You seem to have found a whole lot of other shit as well.
$C: That awful Halo effect.

Google pixel?
$C: Put it by the butter stick
$C: I'd Chaff grenade the place to hell.
$C: LMAO
$C: OP...are you the ‚Äúwhen life gives you lemons‚Äù vine guy?
$C: Whos watching the watchers of the watchers.
$C: 'Well, when life gives you lemons!'
$C: Progression was great. Well done 
$C: The hell you dressed as? 
$C: So this is definitely another instance of Scp-2884, right? 
$C: Brian Quinn?
$C: At first I thought, ‚Äúok.. where‚Äôs the picture I just saw.. why is this new a video‚Äù then I saw the first camera, then I thought, ‚Äúoh same post, wow what a dumbo actually using these thinking they are cool..‚Äù then I saw the second camera, thinking ‚Äúok, this is actually funny now‚Äù then it kept going. I enjoyed this post and will provide an upvote of karma support.
$C: I wish I could give extra votes for the Sloth Astronaut and the gun. 
$C: And yet, some brazen hooligan has still made off with all your TP.
$C: Do not destroy vital testing apparatus
$C: I love the camera watching the stuffed animal with the camera watching the camera. 10/10
$C: I know a guy who put one in the ladies restroom at the local bar haha
$C: u/Richurd
$C: A side note, they found that security signs and cameras are more of a deterrent than the actual security instalation.
$C: Who is the inhuman monster that didn't replace the roll of TP?
$C: You are a legend. I‚Äôve been scrolling through your posts for an hour and I think they‚Äôre my favorite thing ever. 
$C: You need toilet paper
$C: When the camera points to another camera, you know you can‚Äôt trust anyone anymore 
$C: All these shots have really amazing timing. Well done. 
$C: I'm in public and had to cover my mouth to keep from laughing like an idiot, this is gold
$C: This is like Adam Sandler's Five Nights at Freddy's.
$C: Camception at the end was great  
$C: That empty toilet paper roll is a crime unto itself.
$C: We need a mock camera to watch that hat so it doesn't end up on your head again. 
$C: Replace the TP roll you heathen
$C: Now I want to see security cameras playing poker.
$C: Replace your toilet paper roll you scumbag.
$C: Little did he know they were actually real cameras spying on him.
$C: Fake cameras for fake reporting on fake news by fake news media
$C: [I have no idea what the comments are talking about... is it supposed to be a gif? I just see this ](https://i.imgur.com/7BBW7WM.jpg)
$C: You live in a weird place.
$C: Obvious choicees: Locker Rooms, shower's, and changing rooms in malls.
$C: This video just gets better the more I watch it. üòÇ Do you live in Ohio? I noticed the Kroger broth hahah. 
$C: That one staring directly at the toilet is hilarious 
$C: My dad was a manager at a Goodwill and he put a few fake cameras up to try and deter shoplifting. A few months later, not just merchandise, but money began to disappear, so we put real cameras into the fake ones and caught a assistant manager stealing.
$C: Nice hat btw
$C: I too have a framed picture of the beloved Astronaut Sloth (https://i.imgur.com/qSbU7vi.jpg)
$C: You've been lied to. The cameras are real and the lizard people are watching
$C: Change your toilet roll!
$C: Is that thin mints cereal good? 
$C: I worked at a small drug store back in 1980 and these cameras were just coming into use. The owner made it appear that there were cameras all over but most were fake plastic lens. The only real cameras were pointed at the cashiers (so they don't steal) and in the back where they handled the drugs (so they don't steal either). Having the cameras had little impact on the stealing. 

(just noticed my cake-day... redditor for 12 years)
$C: All the fake ones are distractions from the real one in the bathroom obviously.
$C: Goodwill Hunting, the fake camera stunting
$C: you're out of toilet paper

$C: Why is this funny? Am I old? I think I'm old
$C: Excuse me sir, but were you wearing a cowboy hat indoors?
$C: How's your 1980 XS400?  :P You gained a new creeper today.
$C: this is Epic
$C: Better then how we use the ones at work. 
$C: G‚Äôday m‚Äôlady.
$C: Yo dawg, I heard you like security cameras, so we got you a security camera to watch your security cameras watching your security cameras
$C: remember to buy toilet paper

$C: I've been thinking about putting fake camera in front of a toilet for ages, but to hide a real camera somewhere, just to see how people would react. 
$C: My grandfather passed away last March. This reminds me of him. He found these fake house alarms at the dollar store (he was the type of man who swore by duct tape and frequently picked up ‚Äútreasures‚Äù others left for trash on the side of the road). Anyway, he put these alarms up in his house, and they were soooo crappy and loud. We made fun of him for them all the time, but he swore they did the job.

He might not have been wrong. I‚Äôm sure anyone trying to break in would have been scared shitless by the sound of that and ran. Ha. 


$C: Is your house a meme?
$C: I had a friend who installed a fake camera looking at his kitchen sink... right after everyone started doing their dishes. 
$C: Trust no one, not even yourself.
$C: This is genuinely hysterical. Nice work OP.
$C: The last cam-ception nearly killed me. Literally. Infected lung and laughed to hard
$C: u/zprtc
$C: I never thought I'd say this, but today I saw a post on r/funny that was actually funny. 
$C: The bathroom span made me laugh. Totally a single guy. 

1 tooth brush.
Toilet paper is empty.
A bottle of drain-o on the floor. 

So either he shaves his beard in the sink and keeps getting clogged or he just took a massive shit and the plunger didn't cut it.
$C: You seem like the kind of guy I want to hang out with. You doing anything this weekend? 
$C: I need to know. Did you set up your shine for this video or has it always been there???
$C: M‚Äôcamera
$C: my old roommate and i installed an old security camera in the bathroom of the house we rented. we ran the cable behind a picture frame just to make it look like it was hooked up. then we took it one step further, took a picture from the camera's angle and would pull it up on our computer or tv when we had people over. we would usually have it pulled up when they came out of the bathroom just to freak them out. one guy got so embarrassed and said " I must have looked like an idiot waddling around like that." we still don't know what he was doing but we die laughing every time this is brought up.
$C: never forget the first sloth astronaut
$C: if this is what your home actually looks like, i no longer feel bad that my place doesn't look like something outta /r/malelivingspace 
$C: I was gonna be like ‚Äúwhy are you like this?‚Äù But I saw your previous posts with your parents involved and I see now
$C: Fridge 
$C: My WiFi network is ‚Äúbathroom cam 1‚Äù. 

I think I need one of these. 
$C: This is great
$C: "Fake" nice try NSA. 
$C: You need to replace that TP roll homie, or some poor bastard visiting you is gonna have to squat walk to the linen closet (because something tells me you don't have any extra rolls under the sink) 
$C: Change the toilet paper roll you knob !
$C: You can never trust your serveiling "stuffed animal serveilance camera" camera that's why you must always set up a "serveiling 'stuffed animal serveilance camera' camera" surveillance camera 
$C: These things work great too. First job out of college was a manager of a Family Video, and someone was going into the back room with the porn and stealing the insert covers from the dvd cases. Put up a fake camera back there and never had issues again. 
$C: Why do you have a cardboard cutout of yourself?
$C: Come on down to real fake cameras!
$C: Score!  I actually purchased these from Radio Shack when they were $30ish a piece!  I used them to detour kids from vandalizing a house I was flipping.  They had been vandalizing it for weeks, and it worked like a charm!
$C: This probably really stresses out Solid Snake.
$C: put one in your bathroom then when guests come over and use your bathroom they will notice it and freak out.

edit: didn't realize this was a video. clicking the link directly only gave a picture
$C: The NSA got nothing on you.
$C: i now want to do this so badly at my house 
$C: No surprise he‚Äôs wearing a fedora 
$C: Well they definitely fit with the child like humor the house is decorated with 
$C: Hahaha!! The bathroom one is my favorite.
$C: I thought its purpose was to pass butter
$C: Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty good.
$C: Hey what's up guys it's Jack Black here.
$C: Your bedroom and your parents toilet.
$C: The camera in front of the toilet got me hahaha
$C: This made my fucking day
$C: Is no one going to address that weird shrine with the sloth and the gun? wtf is going on there....
$C: Is that a fedora? 
$C: I remember doing a magazine drive in middle school and if you sold enough magazines the fake cameras were on of the prizes you could pick. I worked my ass off to sell enough to get that camera, and I mounted it above my bedroom door to keep my brother out. It fooled him for almost a year. 
$C: Anyone else expected a camera to be in the toilet and another in the eye of that big plush?
$C: I once bought one of those. Installed it very conspicuously in the men's washroom. On the bottom of the mount I stuck a decal that said "property of (coworkers name)". Hilarity ensued.
$C: Had a security camera at the Subway I worked at when I was 16. The red light was on, but the VCR had long since broke. 
$C: Thank you for this! I really needed a good laugh after today and this did it!
$C: Utterly redundant tech after the smart phone... 

$C: The fucking blink from the red light on the first one had me fucking dying
$C: Never laughed so hard, funniest reddit post to date!!! 
$C: I want to put these in obvious places around my bedroom.  Ceiling, wall, a foot away on the headboard.  If the girl freaks out I'll tell her they're fake and we will laugh about it.  If she doesn't, I'll replace them with real ones.
$C: Cameras covering the utmost important parts of one's home, the cereal cabinet, toilet, and pet sloth shrine.
$C: OMG. Stop vertical video syndrome!
$C: I also have a gun, a picture of a sloth in an astronaut suit, hundreds of dollars in cash and Christmas candles on my hallway shrine too.
$C: I wish I could do fun things like this but unfortunately it is illegal to have mock cameras up in Louisiana.
$C: Can we get a better picture of the sloth shrine?
$C: What if they're actually real and someone monitors you doing everything?
$C: M‚Äôlady
$C: Need to refill the toilet paper! NEXT!!!
$C: This gif is hilarious from start till end
$C: edgy
$C: I feel slightly better knowing you're the OP.  Saw it already posted to /r/gifsthatkeepgiving and thought someone just had a shrine for you with that cutout.
$C: That house looks so creepy already without the weird cameras
$C: you need toilet paper
$C: Don't post it online you idiot. Now you've told them you have fake cameras. Ruined the whole point of buying themü§êü§êüò©
$C: This guy lives in a meme jungle
$C: anyone else think of MetalGear Solid?
$C: Which part is the "funny" part?
$C: Why does this have 108k upvotes?? 
$C: I wish I could give you more than one upvote. Every shot got funnier. 
$C: This is the gayest shit ive seen

$C: Big Brother is watching (you pee).
$C: You need a camera pointed at the toilet paper rolls. Striking paper is gold round these parts.
$C: Okay this made me laugh, well played.
$C: Amazing hat
$C: There's a guy that doesn't put a new toilet paper roll. Right there. Pfft.
$C: Hilarious camera placements my dude. 
$C: Your house looks like the house of a friend where all the other friends hang out.
$C: The snack cam was a nice touch 
$C: Can tell you have used that toilet paper again since there was less than a half a sheet left on it...
$C: Cameras watching cameras. Thats security for your security people.
$C: Sloth shrine got me!

Imagine the prank potential these things have with housemates... xD
$C: I wanna do this but I really don't wanna drill a hole in my wall
$C: You have a lot of weird and interesting things in your house.
$C: Paranormal Activity 7 is going to be sweeeeeeet
$C: Its the NSA's new spying tool
$C: My dad used fake cameras when he owned a store. If someone denied pocketing something he could point out the cameras and the would be thief would return the item.
$C: Why do you have Mick Dundee‚Äôs hat?
$C: Your house should charge admission to enter and view
$C: Your house is full of the exact sort of things that I would expect from someone wearing that hat. 
$C: Bathroom stalls.
$C: Low key though the bathroom one is real right?
$C: Glorious 
$C: I love how the red light of the camera flashes once when he opens the kitchen cabinet
$C: So random XD
$C: Genius
$C: Replace the toilet paper, heathen.
$C: Do you wear that hat as a joke?
$C: I would like to come to visit you!
$C: I totally expected a camera inside the toilet
$C: What if op made this gif to trick his roommates into thinking they aren't real security cameras? ü§îü§îü§î
$C: "Fake"
$C: the shrine lol
$C: That 3rd camera at the end... Well done. 
$C: Love the ending with the camera's facing each other.

$C: Must be viewed with California's newly legal weed 
$C: Bathroom for sure. 
$C: thats strong comedic timing 
$C: [I don't know why you would hide that glorious fro under that hat.](https://i.imgur.com/Xwqgoiu.png)
$C: Is that what you tell all the ladies you take to your house right before they use the washroom?
$C: The plot twist of the camera pointing at a camera.............pointing at *ANOTHER* camera has me cracking up.
$C: When you can‚Äôt trust anything or anyone
$C: I work for UPS and I had a shipment investigation at this apartment because packages kept getting stolen. So I talked to the guy about going online and making it so that he had to sign for his packages. He was telling me that after a couple of packages got stolen he bought a camera for his front door. But someone stole the camera! And a week earlier his car was stolen from the parking lot. Lol I told him his best bet was to move.
$C: I absolutely lost it at the three cameras pointing at each other 
$C: Needs one pointed directly into the lens of another, so that he can properly "watch" infinity.
$C: I bet they are mock mock cameras so he can film people on the toilet but just claim they are mock cameras. 
$C: I've never laughed as hard on a gif in my life. Thank you for this.
$C: Lmfao
$C: A camera for a camera for a camera for a large plushie, I love it 
$C: I'm not sure what Reddit gold is, but this fucker deserves all of it.
$C: What about a camera to record the other camera incase someone thinks about stealing the first camera
$C: Hahaha, I like the three cameras at the end the best.
$C: The ending was brilliant 
$C: The last scene with the 3 cameras killed me üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Also, as a diehard rainbow six siege player thatd give me a heart attack. 
$C: It‚Äôs the life and lemons guy! 
$C: Rare to see such quality OC on Reddit.  Bravo.
$C: It's funny that he has a cowboy hat
$C: Replace ur toilet paper roll u mad man
$C: i want to hang out in this awesome house
$C: *looks at toilet paper roll*

OP, you're bad people
$C: See thats why the bad guys never win. They never have cameras for the other cameras.
$C: North Korean camera setup at the end there
$C: Me - hey guys wanna come over for the weekend?
Friends - not if that camera is still in the bathroom.
$C: Yo the sloth shrine was hilarious but I lost my shit at the frog and triple camera action
$C: Good job troubleshooter!

Friend Computer is pleased with your Mandatory Happiness Enforcement training!
$C: I love you.
$C: Have that
$C: I love the trifecta at the end!!!!
$C: Thought it was a still picture at first. I have never been so happily wrong. 
$C: the saying "when life give you lemons" needs to be updated to "when goodwill has fake security cams on sale"
$C: Lol. What are you wearing? What is your house?
$C: I own one of those giant stuffed frogs as well. My girlfriend named it Richard Gilmore. 
$C: Your house is a valve game. 
$C: the one in the bathroom got me.

why can‚Äôt i find fun things at goodwill? 
$C: There's a bounty on your head, OP.
$C: i expected a camera in the toilet 
$C: Just like Danganronpa! You must be controlling Monokuma! 
$C: I laughed way too hard at this.
$C: Well when life gives you cameras 
$C: I‚Äôve worked at a few places with those up. My boss even kept the boxes
$C: Jesus Hat and Beard Guy Christ. 
$C: I laughed so hard at this. Great setups.
$C: Is this in your Air B&B?
$C: The re-sale store near my house had one of these mounted in the back where they accepted drop offs and to this day I still wonder if they knew or not...
$C: Bad Luck
$C: "WOW" -Owen Wilson
$C: This made me actually chortle 
$C: You're peculiar guy haha
$C: The first and last ones might as well be Banksy installations.
$C: Big Brother is watching
$C: I hear they work great at filming fake news
$C: As you don't have an anus?
$C: I thought the punchline was gonna be realizing goodwill was using the same fake cameras
$C: Plot twist, the government planted them in goodwill so they could spy on you.
$C: Change the toilet paper roll you anarchist. 
$C: I wanted to hate OP when I saw him in the reflection, wearing a stripper's cowboy hat. This post made me chuckle, so I do not hate OP. 


Burn that hat before you get head and face crabs.
$C: *Robbers breaks in, opens pantry and sees camera

Robber 1: These people must be fat

Robber 2: Why do you say that? 

Robber 1: Because they watch what they eat


$C: Are the really take cameras?
$C: https://imgur.com/a/WTy8I
$C: I thought the camera would be inside the toad
$C: That ending lol - corporate America at work
$C: "fake" cameras riiiiiight OP I'll play along...
$C: Where is the gateway to the Narnia that is your house? I must find it. 
$C: Are you Mcree? 
$C: I knew the camera was going to be pointed at the toilet but I expected it to be a little more discrete or in the corner, not right at eye level. Hilarious.
$C: The one in the bathroom just made everyone in surveillance laugh.
$C: How is the Thin Mint cereal?
$C: Time to refill the toilet paper, OP
$C: Only one toilet cam? How are you going to make any money? It‚Äôs not even a real cam. It‚Äôs a phony! A big fat phony! 
$C: What are you wearing tho XD
$C: nice hat there dorkis. 
$C: From the placement of the scale right in front of your toilet, I can only assume you're measuring your biggest shits.  Please confirm.  
$C: You should stick one on top of your hat 
$C: I swear if I was rich I would hire you to be my home decorator 
$C: I would put it in a WC, possibly a public one!
$C: Meme palace 
$C: I had a fake one with a motion sensor. I put it in my bathroom. 
$C: I have that exact picture also framed in my kitchen. Been there for about 2 years, my family knows but no one has moved it. 
$C: FYI, these things are actually pretty useful sometimes. We use them as deterrent for burglars in my building, so that they think they are being watched, but I still feel like I get some sort of privacy.
$C: I've never seen a real camera with a blinking red light like that. when you see blinking red light it means 90% that it's fake
$C: lol I have that same sloth picture on my desk at work

always gets a laugh
$C: This is an answer to "who will watch the watchers?"
$C: I'm pretty sure you could charge redditors for the opportunity to walk through your home.
$C: During my days at Radio Shack we would say "simulated security cameras for simulated security." 
$C: need lots of more Cameras 
$C: Are you THE Mr Reddit?
$C: Please clean your grout.
$C: hidden cams HD cams ,LOL
$C: Public water fountains. Like right next to the spout,  pointing at people's faces. 
$C: Cameras purchased from a Sale??
$C: The meme density is off the charts
$C: Wait, how did you get a video of all of these cameras?
$C: this man is living in a meme universe
$C: Dude. No toilet paper? Are you a savage?
$C: New life goal
$C: I laughed way too hard at this, props!
$C: When I lived in a bad neighborhood but was to poor for a real system I put up fake cameras, they would move every so often and had a red blinking light. They were like $15 each and ran on triple a batteries 

Never got broken into 
$C: I got one of these for Christmas in homeschool once. So I put it up in the top of my locker, as a joke.

Didn't even make it to the end of that day before the royal bitch of a teacher across the hall saw it and told me I had to take it down. I explained it was fake, but she was all "Video recording, or even the suggestion of video recording is prohibited, take it down or it's detention."

Much later, I would hang it up in my "college house" inside the door to my bedroom. One time a very attractive friend was over and told me she flashed the camera. I told her it was real and she started to freak, so I told her I was kidding and took it down to show her. She calmed down and inside I cried that it wasn't real.
$C: do you live in a playhouse? 
$C: I know store owners who used these in the early 2000s, as well as cheap but paranoid grandparents.

On the lens it even says "TV CAMERA" and what would a security camera be without a faux red recording light?

I used to see these listed all the time at Harbor Freight back in the early 2000s and for some reason in pool catalogues, like In The Swim catalogues. 

My grandparents would get pool supply catalogues and I'd fantasize about all the cool pool toys and floats they had. My grandparents only ever ordered buckets of chlorine. I thought the 60lb package weight on UPS mean they were getting something good like a water slide but it never was :(
$C: Bad Luck
$C: [that last shot](https://pics.me.me/trust-nobody-not-even-yourself-not-trusting-yourself-22919447.png)
$C: Disposable income: the post
$C: Clyde Frog?!?
$C: I wish I was friends with this guy.
$C: So many questions...

$C: That's a sweet shrine. 
$C: this guy jokes. 
$C: Love your hat! üëç 
And this is something I would do, just like the fake sign in my yard "protected by ADT" for safety reasons, ya know?! 
$C: This is fake ha ha ha ha 
$C: Time to get the Camera Shy achievement
$C: How about the trash?
$C: Where to buy these? T_T
$C: Put them around your local dog park so assholes might be more inclined to pick up their shit.
$C: Though I was going to see the butter robot 
$C: my sister had fake cameras once. they didn't actually flash with the red light. that's lit. u should put them outside tho!
$C: Fantastic lol
$C: I have the same giant stuffed frog.
$C: Win. 
$C: The toilet one lol
$C: Refill the TP dispenser you animal!
$C: It's been awhile since a Reddit post has made my laugh out loud. Helped that I didn't realize it was a gif at first.
$C: That was legitimately hilarious. I laughed hard. Thanks for this. :)
$C: Cool hat, bro.
$C: A+, + suspenseful camera work.

This guy memes.
$C: You and BART must shop at the same place.... 
$C: Everywhere...
$C: I like this quirky bearded cowboy who films himself on the crapper. I think we could make a three fake camera sitcom out of him. With David Schwimmer as his tightly wound elder brother forced to live with him by court order. 
$C: The one in the cabinet got me 
$C: WHAT IN THE HELL, MY WIFE HAS THAT EXACT SAME FROG!
$C: This is stinking brilliant
$C: is your snapchat private? my snapchat feed is pretty boring currently and id love to follow some comedians
$C: I'm just really curious what any potential female visitors would think of this sacred mansion. I'd love to hear some testimonials. 
$C: "Fake" cameras, uhuh.
$C: The only crime occuring in that house is there's no handles on the kitchen cabinets. 
$C: Public washrooms

$C: Ahahahaha epic 
$C: I was pretty stoked for the Thin Mint cereal myself... it hurt the roof of my mouth but the cereal milk at the end was 9/10.
$C: Love the cowboy hat!
$C: I used to work at a place that had these installed. 

Also had a broken detector that would go off when you had the sensor sticker attached.

Only one exit worked. 
$C: Gotta make sure you have a camera watching the camera that‚Äôs watching the camera. Can‚Äôt be too careful these days 
$C: deleted
$C: It's like the Truman show 
$C: Are you Banksy?
$C: Now you just need to set up a hidden camera and capture burglars reactions for maximum value.

Also need burglars. 
$C: I need this. to put in the front yard. Every few weeks I catch a car parked in front of my house, and then if I casually go water a plant or go check the mail-box, they spontaneously remember that they have an appointment to get to that that exact moment. I assume they're scouting places to rob in our neighborhood or something. 
$C: This post made me genuinely smile from cheek to cheek. That happens rarely. 
$C: What have bathroom users said so far?
$C: r/madlads
$C: How long have you been an AirBnB host?
$C: Take the damn upvote as I get chewed out by my boss because I was cackling at work.
$C: My boss uses these. Puts them up all around her property, as well as deer cameras (which she never checks the pictures on). She does it to discourage hooligans from running rampant. 
$C: Recorded with a fake camera.
$C: put them all in the bathroom
$C: You're my fuckin hero
$C: Exactly my type of humour. I love it.
Although I'd have had the last camera on the adjacent wall, watching the camera watch the camera.
$C: Hello neighbor.
$C: I...I have so many questions about this video.
$C: The thin mints cereal box though, that stuff is pretty good!
$C: Thank you for this golden gif
$C: That sloth shrine though.
$C: Where did you get that frog.....
$C: Real fake cameras!
$C: Why can‚Äôt I stop laughing! The cabinet?
$C: Colon is a great spot for fake cameras
$C: Initially thought it was a picture. Was in for a wonderful surprise
$C: The house that meme built.
$C: LMAO IM CRYING 
$C: Joke is that the toilet camera isn‚Äôt fake, the others just give a false sense of security.
$C: Don‚Äôt forget to replace that toilet paper roll before your next toilet break!!
$C: Lmao! Every time I look at it I laugh more 
$C: My past job bought a bunch once because someone was stealing. Well the dipshit assistant manager, she left them out in the open for like 2 weeks. She was finally was going hang them but i told her everyone already saw how fake they was...  i just laughed and ended up taking few home because they was never going use them
$C: Just leave them in showers at the gym.
$C: Funny story, I used to work at a local news station for about a year and instead of having any real security they just put one of these exact cameras at the back door, the LED didn't even work.
$C: Who is watching the watchers? And who is watching the watchers of the watchers.

I like it.
$C: [is this you?](https://cdn4.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Hello-Neighbor-12.png)
$C: Okay, you got me.  I laughed out loud at work at this one.
$C: Incase anybody wants to up their memery game.

$C:  a shrine for a sloth astronaut
$C: Mr.President will be proud of your home
$C: I have an unhealthy desire to visit this residence with a portal gun in hand. Surely there's an achievement for finding them all?
$C: Now you can rent it out on Airbnb.
$C: r/ATBGE
$C: I like how they looked like they would be hidden well, and then they weren't! I need to go to goodwill more often....
$C: I put one of those up at work a few years ago. Got a few people spooled up.
$C: my dad did the same thing when I was a kid. He found a bunch of broken security cameras in the bin outside of the store he worked at and he took them all home and set them up all around the outside of the house complete with fake wires that went literally just into a piece of wood. Everyone in the neighborhood thought we had a real security system. 
$C: Ur running low on tp
$C: The people who lived in my house before me put two of these up outside! They have wires that attach to nothing and just dangle though, so it's only fooling the world's dumbest criminal. 
$C: I won‚Äôt say where, but at least one of the kayak and surfboard rental locations in the Outer Banks only uses these. You could roll up with a pickup truck and a cheap pair of bolt cutters and make off with several thousand dollars worth of boats, boards, and paddles. 
$C: Be sure to fit one in the bathroom!
$C: Gotta make sure no one steals the cameras.
$C: I like how the lens declares "CAMERA TV LENS" just in case you didn't realize.
$C: Two of the fakes we ran were just "returned cameras" that didn't hook up.. They just looked like they probably are on. We never messed with the red light. Just looked fishy to us, to have it on.
$C: Now put the cameras in a loop watching each other.
$C: lol this is verry funny to have a camera pointing at you when u taking a shhht
$C: It's been at least a year since a post on /r/funny was OC and actually made me laugh. Bravo.
$C: Nice... hat?
$C: yo dude if i had to take a shit in your bathroom i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôd be more concerned about the camera or the fact there‚Äôs no tp on the roll
$C: ‚ÄúWe have this camera to look at this camera that looks at this camera that looks at this camera‚Äù
$C: 
What‚Äôs it worth putting all those holes in your walls?
$C: Holy crap I have that frog. 

https://imgur.com/gallery/KQNr6
$C: Hahaha. That was actually awesome. 
$C: All hail Mother Mary Sloth
$C: This guy is a savage. Lmao this made my day thank you lol.
$C: The cameras watching the other cameras is sheer genius, sir. 
$C: Reminds me a lot of Metal Gear Solid haha
$C: Lol I love the sloth shrine! 
$C: Wow.  You are a fucking comedic genius.
$C: Hilarious
$C: They're not fakes. They're mocks.
$C: I'm gonna do worse than give you one star
$C: You should have two of them in a staring contest.  Who will win?!?!
$C: Did I just see the best altar ever?
$C: WTF is the obsession with turning videos into gifs
$C: Is your house a meme?
$C: Plot twist: the bathroom camera one actually works.
$C: I got cameras on my cameras that watch other cameras cameraing
$C: I havent laughed out loud at something on the internet in a while
$C: Everyone should invest in the fake camera market, as I have a feeling the amount of bought fake cameras is going to increase by 2,947,891,723%.
$C: The one in the bathroom is really funny, gotta catch any would be masturbators in your house XD
$C: OP needs to change his TP roll before he finds himself doing the pants down shuffle past his shrine to the hallway closet for more... especially now that it would be on camera.
$C: You‚Äôre actually buying and eating the Thin Mints GIrl Scout Cookies cereal? You‚Äôre my hero and you should be ashamed of yourself
$C: Is that Onyx? The weird interview guy? Lol 
$C: Nice hat.
$C: This gave me a heckin giggle
$C: Sweet hat
$C: I just wanted to share that I've been in bed with the flu for 5 days and this is the first thing that has made me laugh since last Thursday.  
$C: Gold 
$C: A couple I babysat for had some cameras similar to these... I wonder if they were fake, too
$C: Harbor Freight still sells those, or at least 'decoy' cameras
$C: I loved the recursive frog cameras :3
$C: Puts fake cameras everywhere in the house as a joke; puts real one in bathroom
$C: I don't know what Reddit is, but you are some of it
$C: TWIST: They're not fake.
$C: "Dude why do you have a camera aimed at the toilet"

"Oh don't worry its fake lol"

"Uh huh"
$C: Ok.
$C: This is awesome!  I wanna hang out & drink beers with you.
$C: Here are links to different models from their amazon store.
Dome style: [ooo](https://www.amazon.com/Mitaki-japan-Non-functioning-Security-Mounting-Template/dp/B005HP5EOK)
The one from the video: [ooo](https://www.amazon.com/Fake-Security-Camera/dp/B008RYDLFC/)
$C: Be honest. That scale next to the toilet is only there to weigh your poops, isn't it?
$C: As a housekeeper who's really starting to get weirded out by all the cameras people have in their houses, I thank you for making this!
$C: Important side point: Thin Mints Cereal (which appears in the kitchen) is really good. If you haven't tried it...find a box.
$C: When I worked in the mill I had a buddy named Crazy Pete.  He ended up putting one of these up in the wash house shower stall. The guys were throwing soap at it & one guy at one point went to hit it with a broom, but he had welded it to a plate on the wall. It was there for 2 or three days.
$C: Women‚Äôs restroom stall 
$C: "what is my purpose"
$C: You'd be surprised how many stores have fakes cameras "professionally installed."
$C: I‚Äôd like to put up a security in the bathroom too. Fuckin hate it when people don‚Äôt change the roll when they use the last of the toilet paper. WHO ARE THESE ANIMALS?!
$C: What piece of mind knowing that the fake cameras have coverage of the fake cameras in that last setup. 
$C: We have the exact same "camera" at our front door. 10/10 Never got burglarized yet
$C: That sloth is legit my phone case background haha
$C: Based on the shot in the bathroom, I am convinced you are in fact Al Chestbreach himself.
$C: I want to state the matter at hand about why you didn‚Äôt courtesy replace the toilet paper after finishing it?
$C: Howdy partner! 
$C: That's a nice frog.
$C: Tripple camera is dope. The one by the toilet, pretty easy to cover with a towel, duh!

$C: Put them in a semi-public Bathroom!  Place then in obvious places you can't possibly miss seeing them, like right above the urinal pointed down at it and such. And put a real camera outside the exit to catch people freaking out as they leave...  Probably not the most ethical idea but would be entertaining!
$C: So you're going to put them up in... Good Will?
$C: You need to replace your toilet paper. That is, unless you wanted to film your own frustration the next time you poop.
$C: John Marston, is that you?
$C: The one that needs REAL monitoring is your TP situation.
$C: I am dying hahahaha. The one pointed at the stuffed animal and then the one pointed at the one pointed at the stuffed animal. I woke my angry boyfriend up laughing but he'll thank me later haha
$C: I like your hat
$C: Do you want a roommate?
$C: I hope you have a backup roll of toilet paper on deck
$C: big laughs, thank you
$C: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
$C: This reminds me of one of the first blueprints in Shenzhen I/O. Great game, but boy do Zachtronics games get hard fast
$C: Plot twist. That's not OPs house.
$C: I live that more then I should lol
$C: Goodwill?
Kroger?

South East US for sure.
$C: You should really point one of those at the box of thin mints. 
$C: I happened to be listening to Tears For Fear's 'Mad World' when I clicked on this. Not only did the timing match up but it made the whole experience incredibly surreal.
$C: The last one got me good.
$C: Nice
$C: They're not actually fake, NSA is watching you now
$C: reminder: https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/5istuq/help_please_wife_is_mad_i_spent_money_and_i_cant/
$C: ‚ÄúWhen life gives you lemons‚Äù
$C: Our dispensary used those when we opened in ‚Äò08 before we could afford the real thing. At least it got some laughs from patients.
$C: Gosh why haven't I done this yet camera on camera action
$C: This is some stupid shit like I would do lol.
$C: "Don't worry, the camera in the bathroom is fake too. Haha..."
$C: I get them at my local dollar store for 3$ a piece, I don't get the humour in this, they really do work 
$C: lol
$C: Is that  a Fedora I see???
$C: teh whacky and randome monkey cheese pirate
$C: Change your TP, you savage
$C: A surveillance camera?
$C: "i have all these cameras for your protection, m'lady" *tips hat*
$C: I want to shake your hand sir.
$C: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
$C: ‚ÄòWhat is my purpose‚Äô 
$C: Spotted the Girl Scout mint cereal! 
$C: It looks like thw butter robot from rick and morty.
$C: It seems like half of the time real cameras don't work and that most of the time when they do the footage is so grainy that it's useless anyway. Might as well use fake cameras.
$C: Jesus Christ... It's like a meme house.  When can i move in?
$C: I can't view gfycat in work and I am having a lot of trouble figuring out what this GIF is from the comments. 
$C: I needed this today.
$C: huh, i have that same cardboard cutout
$C: I held in the laugh until the camera pointed at the other camera.
$C: Seems like some Hello Neighbor shit. 
$C: My mother has one in her bathroom. Cracks people up every time
$C: The empty roll of TP = gold.
$C: I think you should aim them all at toilets for the bonus outrage lulz.



$C: are they battery powered?
$C: i wish you'd found a bunch more of these because i didn't want this to end
$C: I'd set them up around the neighborhood and play real life Metal Gear Solid.
$C: Fake security cameras, weird.
$C: The real joke is he put a Raspberry Pi with camera inside each one. 
$C: "To ensure the safe performance of all authorized activities, do not destroy vital testing apparatus."
$C: Rick won't be happy about this guys 

The passing butter found new a job. 

God damn those mex-t-cam. 

$C: You have the coolest house
$C: video=genius.
$C: Put them in public bathrooms and act ad a bystander to get reactions 
$C: Did you have to drill holes in, that's a commitment to the prank

$C: Reminds me of this episode of Rick & Morty. 

https://youtu.be/X7HmltUWXgs
$C: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got the whole house wired up; bedrooms, bathrooms, bathrooms.... other... bathrooms‚Äù
$C: Public bathrooms
$C: The second camera at the end did it for me
$C: lolol I love it! The altar at the beginning was hilarious.
$C: Wow Reddit people actually upvoted something that's actually funny
$C: Damn this is amazing 
$C: So much work for internet points‚Ä¶
$C: I guess you can say... you went goodwill hunting... kill me xD
$C: I know a genuine Panaphonics when I see one. 
$C: The last 3 killed me
$C: The thing is.  Real cameras, batteries, and storage are now small enough to fit entirely inside those fake cameras, which are probably from the era of VHS security tapes.
$C: **A surveillance camera?**
$C: I have more questions than answers.. O_o
$C: Saw a restroom at a basement bar in Singapore with one like these. They paired it with a fake video feed on a monitor outside the room. Good stuff.
$C: Just need karma

$C: Nobody gonna steal that frog
$C: I have the same astronaut sloth picture as a painted poster!
$C: We can tell that you are the only person who lives in that house.
$C: Inside a public restroom stall!!! 
$C: idk what is weirder, the cameras or your house
$C: The bathroom cam is actually quite smart. Whoever uses the last of that roll will feel obligated to replace it.
$C: If I had those I‚Äôd put them all in a stairwell, Metal Gear style. Then paint an exclamation point above them.
$C: I prefer ‚Äúdouble-dundency‚Äù
$C: Wtf m8?
$C: Metal gear camera setup irl
$C: Loooooool at the toilet scene
$C: Dear lord. That giant green stuffed frog... My were driving across Arizona and the wife had to go to the bathroom. So we stop at a truck stop, and she disappears. I'm checking the instagram, when she walks out with that Frog and dumps it in the passenger seat of the car before climbing in back.

"The fuck???"

"I don't know. I just had to have it." 

And so it sits, right by our doorway, guarding it with its lifeless eyes. Though I should take a page out of this post's book and put the pet camera in it so it will actually be something useful as opposed to just annoyingly creepy.
$C: Nice hat.
$C: Dude that‚Äôs amazing, please tell me i can order them online!! 
$C: Start AirBnB hosting. It'll be crazy popular!!
$C: [Maybe you should have hidden them so nobody would know they were being fake recorded.](http://assets.amuniversal.com/a4e93f20b1b8012f2fef00163e41dd5b)

$C: The Kerotan Frog from Metal Gear Solid 3?!
$C: Facing the toilet
$C: How to tell they're fake: real cameras don't have blinking red lights. 
$C: Omg 
$C: I love it.
$C: damn dude this video is hilarious          
that camera movement is on point
$C: I really appreciate the camera watching the camera watching the camera watching the camera. 
$C: That vent is really low in relation to the stove. 
$C: What if you put them in public bathrooms
$C: I wish I could share this video with my co workers. We install surveillance systems.
$C: The real question is WTF is going on in the rest of your house.  Jfc.
$C: Brilliant 
$C: Nice fedora op
$C: was waiting for camera placed in bathroom. was not disappointed. 10/10
$C: I thought a camera was gonna be one of the eyes of the stuffed animal 
$C: I kept clicking back because I thought it was just a picture and that my Reddit was glitching
$C: If only your house was a mansion, we could remake the Resident Evil camera angles.
$C: As far as weird items in your house go, the fake cameras are like really far down on the list.
$C: I lost it on the third camera 
$C: I genuinely laughed wayyyy to hard at this. 
$C: Is that a wiimote under your cabinet? If so, why for?
$C: The camera watching the camera watching the camera üòÖüòÇü§£
$C: Your house is just one big meme. I love it.
$C: Thought the gun was strange, until I saw the cowboy hat in the mirror. Then it made sense.
$C: Why, your bathroom, of course.
$C: Bathrooms are the best place for fake security cameras
$C: I'm the dude that's watching the camera, that's watching the camera, that's watching the camera.
$C: So far you winning 2018! üòÇ
$C: Worth it 
$C: Who watches the watchers
$C: I have a few questions...
$C: OK, that's officially awesome.
$C: I‚Äôm really more interested in the sloth and gun shrine.  Also u sir are a savage. Put some toilet paper on that roll. 
$C: Bathroom cam! Love it lol
$C: Dude!! Start a 24 hour news channel!!
$C: Great hat!
$C: Dat [Space Sloth Tribute Murder Shrine](https://i.imgur.com/iaKV6rH.png)
$C: Nice hat.
$C: Easily the best thing I've seen on the internet today.
$C: I have so many questions. 
$C: now OP can turn one of these into a real camera and no one will suspect a thing. 
$C: Could we get an explanation for what the first security camera is looking at?
$C: Clyde Frog!
$C: Not gonna lie, these are a must if you live in a place where things get stolen a lot.
$C: You should sign up for a reddit profile page. I like your posts and would like to subscribe.

$C: Where did you get that giant frog?
$C: M'lady
$C: Like the one pointing directly at the toilet
$C: This is some good shit! Great comedy.
$C: That "Camception" at the end got me.
$C: Horrendous hat 
$C: I like the camera redundancy, can't eliminate a camera without appearing on another camera!
$C: And responded appropriately.

$C: haha
$C: Support the poor in your area by donating any spare faux security cameras today!
$C: Robbers when spotting the cameras be like (you input whatever)
$C: About that shrine.....
$C: It looks like something out of the game Hello neighbour
$C: Get your real fake cameras here
$C: Bowser, is that you?
$C: Frog in the living room, solid addition from home goods
$C: I like your hat
$C: R/thriftstorehauls
$C: Hey man, nice hat! 
$C: Now people wont dare to toucha your spaghett
$C: This was absolutely hilarious.
$C: The cabinet one is horrifying and I would probably have a heart attack if I saw it.
$C: Nice hat. 
$C: Plot twist, they're real and you are now under surveillance by a very smug spy. 
$C: The handgun just laying out unsecured......  I'd be locked up in jail for that in the state I live in.   
$C: Is that Q from Impractical Jokers that I saw in the mirror?
$C: Lmfao
$C: Op can we be friends?
$C: What is my purpose? 
$C: Can anyone find these on Amazon? 
$C: I hope you take that bathroom one down when/if you have guests, you could legitimately get sued regardless of whether it's real
$C: Put one in your bathroom so when people come over they'll think your a creep
$C: plot twist - the one in the toilet has an LTE chip with live stream to an unknown IP.
$C: Thanks for the laugh!
$C: What is this, the house of memes?
$C: You need to change your toilet roll...before you go take a shit again.
$C: should be live streaming 
$C: I love it
$C: I love them!
$C: lmao that's a lot of security
$C: my family has a house that usually is vacant, it was getting broken into a lot. We put these up, solved the problem.
$C: But who watches the watchman's watchman's watchman?
$C: Oh dang big brother 
$C: This is alright for a novice. An adept like me can make a real camera look at a fake camera, look at a fake camer, look at a fake camera, look at a fake camera, look at a laptop livestream the entire thing.
$C: Well, when life gives you lemons

$C: Not gonna be funny when your fake cameras get stolen and don't know who it was. 
$C: Good work with the cameras at the end.
$C: The craziest thing in this video is the fact that somebody didn't replace that empty toilet paper roll.
$C: What happens when someone doesn't care about the camera and takes it and you can't get them arrested
$C: This seems like something James Veitch would do
$C: Your house reminds me of that GoDaddy internet meme commercial 
$C: oh my god
$C: Ok dear wtf up with your device gun altar?
$C: Don‚Äôt forget tp on your next trip to the store. 
$C: Plot twist - the toilet one is real ( OP's Fetish ) and the long con

$C: are we gonna talk about that hat Indy?
$C: i thougt you meant bootleg like ifone or nokea 
$C: Y h
$C: And this was the moment where Kermit the mutant enlarged frog realized his life would never be private again...... they were always watching 
$C: The artful triple reveal at the end was well-done and the care you took shooting it was not lost on me. 
$C: "what is my purpose?"
You pass butter
".....Oh my god"
$C: I wanted to get about 30 of those and do them all on the wall facing the toilet, just to really weird out my friends.


$C: How much did you pay? I see similar ones for sale on Amazon for like $20 for 4.
$C: I have a couple of the fakie dome ones, with a  blinky  red light.  Thank you harbor freight.
$C: [Had me right up until the super cringey neckbeard hat.](https://media.giphy.com/media/pDsCoECKh1Pa/giphy.gif)
$C: Plot Twist they're  actually real cameras and the feed goes directly to the FBI. I mean so does the cameras in your microwave, television, webcam, and showerhead.
$C: I've always wanted a Mikon.
$C: they make giant carnival sized pepes? what a time to be alive
$C: Sir.  It is only Jan 9 and you have won the internet for 2018.
$C: I love that last setup: No one is going to steal this camera... or the one watching it... or the one watching it!
$C: You seem to have secured the valuables...

$C: Like the cowboy hat, dude.
$C: The ultimate meme lords castle.

$C: Hello neighbor 2
$C: I was half expecting the bathroom one to be attached to the inside of the toilet lid.
$C: The kitchen camera should be aimed directly at that box of Thin Mints
$C: lol gun shrine

and they say americans have an unhealthy attitude towards guns
$C: Well done ::slow clap::
$C: Wow. If this is the living space can we please see the attic/basement?
$C: It bothers me that you didn‚Äôt change out the empty toilet paper roll.
$C: Is that the "when life gives you lemons" Vine guy as a cardboard cut out? 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcLPNGLRHU8
$C: I have one of these at my shop before we got real cameras. I'm totally putting it in our customer bathroom on April 1st. 
$C: You sir, are a fucking legend
$C: Security camera on to another camera that was faced on another, such innovation much wow

$C: WELL DONE SIR! I just laughed from the deepest part of my belly, from the tiny details to the major punch line shots. I thank you OP for getting a genuine and sincere laugh out of me! 

A fantastic way to start my day üòÇ
$C: Cool.
$C: You made me laugh so much, thanks a lot!
$C: He‚Äôs got boxes full of Pepe. 
$C: If OP can find 30 more he can film fake bullet-time video like in The Matrix.
$C: We had one of these set up in our bathroom growing up. It was motion activated and would  blink and sound an alarm when it detected motion. Great way to scare friends. 
$C: Hahaha this is amazing!
$C: Hello fellow Fern friend
$C: This is like NSA porn!
$C: I have questions 
$C: They use those cameras to shoot the fake news!
$C: Need to replace you tiolet paper roll
$C: I questioned how this could be funny, and was pleasantly suprised.
$C: when life gives you lemons
$C: What is my purpose? 
You pass butter.
$C: Are w enjoy going to talk about how beautiful his hat is?
$C: Are you what they call a "memer"?
$C: love the video, but damn.... who was that kitchen made for.

 As a tall kitchen faring person i would struggle to use that stove daily. 
$C: It's not just the placement, but the reveal that makes this fantastic cinematography.
$C: When life gives you lots of lemons, you become rich enough to buy faux security cameras.
$C: This made me smile well done
$C: [SCP-2884](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2884)
$C: Bathroom. 
$C: I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôd feel if a camera was looking at me taking a dump...
$C: That thin mints cereal is amazing.
$C: Sweet hat
$C: You should've put two facing eachothrr
$C: /r/bettereveryloop
$C: It be ya own cameras 
$C: I think I might be in love. Can I subscribe to your newsletter?
$C: Nice hat, Tex
$C: Well done.  You win the internet today
$C: I never thought I'd say this, but today I saw a post on r/funny that was actually funny. 
$C: Looks like hello neighbour
$C: Seems like a safe place to keep your gun
$C: Put one in front of the toilet and showerüòÇ
$C: This actually gave me a good laugh. Thanks.
$C: I lol'd throughout, but I lol'd out loud at the camera watching the camera watching the camera watching the frog.
$C: Can we talk about how close the stove hood is to the stove? Do you hit your chest on it a lot?
$C: I wonder if pointing a mock security camera at my fridge would help with my diet...
$C: What gun is on the shrine?
$C: I have to try it too üòÇ
$C: I have so many questions 
$C: Five nights at Freddie's really rubbed off on you. I don't think that frog is moving any time soon.... but what about the Sloth picture?
$C: The one in the bathroom is funny af. I want to do this now.
$C: I feel like I should set up shrines like that all over my house. And then invite a bunch of people I don't want in my life anymore over for a dinner party. 
$C: what is my purpose? 
$C: You get a free lifetime supply of beard and moustache wax with that hat?
$C: May have been mentioned already, but you need to pick up some toilet paper the next time you head to the store. 
$C: It just gets better the longer you watch
$C: That thin mint cereal. Delicious
$C: Are you Jon Snow?
$C: That was the ugliest sex doll ever.  Which one of you holds the gun when you... you know?
$C: I was gonna ask when you installed these, but judging from your reflection it‚Äôs clearly high noon.
$C: Replace your toilet paper you savage!
$C: Fake cameras always lead to fake news 
$C: I lost it when the cameras were looking at each other. 
$C: What is my purpose?
$C: dun dun dunnnnnnnnnn
$C: We have the same taste in decoration. 
Marry me
$C: They are up for grabs at my local dollar store.  :)

Kind of fake looking up they work.  (Also, they look like 90's security cameras, not like the ones we have now.)
$C: What‚Äôs with the cowboy hat?
$C: Now install real cameras in to the fake camera boxes.  Sell them as 'decoy fake cameras' at a marginal profit!  

It's like the triple-deke, Mighty Ducks style. 
$C: I never knew I needed this in my life till now
$C: plot twist: those aren't real fake cameras, they're cheap knockoffs. 
$C: As criminal justice has confirmed, even just seeing anything that looks to be security can cause criminals to think twice. I had my dorm room broken into and I had HTC Vive sensors mounted to the top of my dressers. They look like cameras, even with a little green light. Didn't have anything stolen, just my room mates shoes next to the door were taken
$C: watch the movie ICU.COM
$C: ..This is my favorite video at the moment. 
$C: This is gold 
$C: This is GOLD! 
$C: ...why was there a picture of a sloth and a gun? Is this John wicks house? 
$C: Were you wearing a cowboy hat in the bathroom clip??
$C: God I love how much fun you have with your house
$C: I laughed way too hard at this. 
$C: Never laughed so hard in the bathroom, at work.
Good one
$C: lol Looks like they came right out of Metal Gear Solid.
$C: What is with the candles and the gun? 
$C: I bet the guy at the NSA got a pay rise coming up with this idea üòÇüòÇ
$C: Plot twist: they're not fake they just send what they record to an undisclosed location.
$C: why is this posted in /r/funny, because it's clearly very funny
$C: As a r6s player... This offends me :^)
$C: I envy the amount of free time you must have
$C: !
$C: If they put this in Delhi, it would still help more than the Police.
$C: I didn't know how badly I needed these in my life up until now.
$C: I see a cowboy hat
$C: Wait you're the Life Gives You Lemons guy? That's amazing lol
$C: The GIF won‚Äôt play for me :( can anybody offer and alternative link or something? I‚Äôm on mobile. Gif cat never works for me

$C: Subtle comedy is the best comedy
$C: badwill

$C: You‚Äôve got some weird shit in your house
$C: A house I used to party at in college had a fake security camera pointed at the toilet. One of the guys that lived in the house joked with me that they post the footage on teensquatters.com 
$C: Your home has a lot of random stuff.
$C: is that a cutout of the "IF Life gives you lemons" guy?
$C: Love the bathroom one.
$C: Goddamnit Ferns. Your content is always great.
$C: These cameras are designed to belittle intruders/employees until they feel so bad about themselves that they leave.
$C: This is my kind of decorating sense.
$C: Is that a cardboard cutout of the "Well when the life gives you lemons..." guy?
$C: Chaotic evil
$C: Let's hope they aren't realüòâ
$C: They look kinda real and the places you have them are funny
$C: I really hope you shoplifted these.
$C: Hilarious
$C: Hey you're  the life gives you lemons guy!

Why do you have a cut out of yourself?

Edit: Also my friend could be your stunt double https://imgur.com/80UmW0h
$C: Nice fedora
$C: I see you enjoying the thin mints cereal
$C: Hey! Give me back my üê∏. He was just in my house before I left!
$C: cool hat
$C: I would be honored to have a beer with this guy.
$C: of course hes a mlady guy
$C: Wait.. that green frog.. it's from my local gas station...
$C: This reminds me of many of Banksy's security cameras.

$C: You‚Äôre out of TP bro.
$C: OH LOOK. Its the lemon guy!
$C: Hey! You can get those from Northern Tool and Equipment, or Harbor Freight.

$C: Your bathroom floor needs cleaning. 
$C: You know that a gopro can actually be put into these
$C: Fuck the cameras, the entire living space is hilarious.
$C: No way, it‚Äôs the when life gives you lemons guy
$C: I acquired one of these years ago and I put it up in my bedroom. I didn't mention it to my girlfriend at the time and as luck would have it, she noticed it right as she pulled her shirt off. She absolutely lost her damn mind. Started screaming. Took a swing at me, and not playfully. I was laughing so hard that I couldn't even explain to her that it was fake for probably 30 seconds. Within the hour, she found it hilarious, but in that moment she definitely wanted me dead.
$C: Bookmark
$C: Are you tired of cameras that actually film people and record stuff?

Then come on down to real fake cameras that‚Äôs us!
$C: Why does this man look like McCree?
$C: Who watches the watchers?
$C: My father uses the fakies. üôÑ
$C: Everything in this is wonderful 
$C: Haven‚Äôt laughed like that for years. What the heck is that shrine 
$C: I have that same picture on my desk at work. Albeit a little smaller. https://imgur.com/6gUq4kG
$C: You need to put an exclamation mark above one of them. 
$C: Are you making sure your memes are under surveillance and are not robbed by a reposter?
$C: I'm dead af 
$C: What an amazingly weird and fun house you have. I like the gun shrine and giant stuffed frog!
$C: OP‚Äôs interior designing is lit!
$C: Your home says a lot about you, You are a strange person.
$C: Damn! I was actually wishing I had one of these last night. Someone stole my last delivered (according to UPS) package, from my front porch, and I'm expecting another package to be delivered today.
$C: Holy moly 130k 
$C: I love the shrine to the gun toting astro-sloth!
$C: Cool hat
$C: Maybe the best thing I've ever seen 
$C: top notch use of those security cameras in my book
$C: I saved this video for future laughs when I want to cut my own hands off
$C: Checking if I‚Äôm able to comment
$C: There's an indoor flea market near me that has several of these scattered about.  It's amusing.  It might as well say "FAKE SECURITY CAMERA" on the side.  I always love the "TV CAMERA LENS" text, too.  Really drives it home.
$C: Does every good will in the world have good shit except the one I visit? All mine has is junk.
$C: Change your toilet paper and nice cowboy hat!
$C: That last one üòÇüòÇ

$C: These do actually work!
$C: Is there a video`?
$C: I need this so bad. I have an echo in my bathroom and like to use the drop in to ask if the shit is going good.
$C: They used to sell those at spencers
$C: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wqzLoXjFT34
$C: Your home is a 3d meme.
$C: I have about 40 questions. Not a single one is about the cameras.
$C: Holy shit that's hilarious
$C: This reminds me of an episode of the black mirror
$C: I don't think you have good will.
$C: That hat makes everything so much better.
$C: I always enjoy putting them up in bathrooms. Definitely one in my house somewhere and maybe stick them up in a public one that isn't totally obvious but not hiding very well. 
$C: I used to work on the security industry.  I had a 'Warning; 24hr video surveillance' sign inside the bathroom door, and at one time a 'BEWARE! 10.000 VOLTS!!' sign behind the cistern.  

I found out ages later that one of my friends kids was too scared to go at my house in case he ended up on YouTube or got electroluxed TO DEATH when flushing.  
$C: Omg, thank you. This made my day. Lol.
$C: Public bathrooms... 
$C: The punchline made this hilarious. A camera for a camera for a frog?
$C: When life gives ya cameras!
$C: Well, I laughed 'til I peed. 
$C: But the gun is real.
$C: Nice cowboy hat
$C: I want one!

$C: /r/weekendgunnit is leaking. 
$C: I am a fan of the cowboy hat
$C: I see this and all I can hear is the milkman theme
$C: Made me laugh while at work, good work op. 
$C: You just gave me an amazing idea!
$C: I guess whoever put these cameras up doesn't have much good will.
$C: Sup friend! Glad to see you're still keeping up a high level of goofing around.
$C: Public bathroom that will *Freak* people out.
$C: The cakes is a lie.
$C: This makes me want to play Goldeneye
$C: looks like your out of TP. 
$C: Now you can catch whoever used the last of the toilet paper roll and didn't replace it. 
$C: Rick and morty anyone? 
$C: Hilarious 
$C: Jokes on you. They were actually fake fake cameras and are broadcasting everything.
$C: "It always feels like, somebody's watching me!"
$C: Stolen from r/4chan
$C: Okay, so are all just ignoring the fact that the toilet comes off the kitchen and there doesn't appear to be a door?
$C: well when life gives you lemons
$C: This is amazing :D
$C: I expected nothing less than one in the toilet, but the fedora was an unexpectedly nice touch.
$C: would gold if I had gold, truly hilarious
$C: The trick is that they actually work. And now the goblins are spying on you. 
$C: Dat cowboy hat tho...
$C: I-is this what being an adult is like?
$C: This was honestly great. Your shrine is honestly #shrinegoals.
The final one got me bad though.
$C: I used to have something like this. I got it from one of those book ordering magazines that schools would occasionally give out. I thought it was an actual spy camera, really disappointed when it wasn‚Äôt.
$C: Hey dickhead!  You made me LOL in the dentist office and a couple grandmas I really wanted to bang just looked at me funny.  Thanks for ruining my chance to get laid dick
$C: U can clearly tell, this man is a bachelor. üëçüëçüòÇ
$C: No joke, my moms and step grandmothers have these fake cameras and has actually deterred people away
$C: I'd want to put real cameras in them.
$C: Trust no one, not even yourself.

$C: I like the goth cowboy look you have going on.

Immediately I recognized it and i went up to the office after and asked if its real. They claimed it was and so i askes to see the live feed but they couldn't comply. I told them my brother has one exactly like it and i knew it waa fake. They just played stupid abd said it was. Nothing. More to this story, just wanted to share.

$C: "What Orwell failed to predict was that we‚Äôd buy the cameras ourselves, and that our biggest fear would be that nobody was watching." - Keith Jensen
$C: I found these at my university in the bookstore. One was pointed randomly at some product where no one would be seen, so I put a book in front of it and told my friend "watch this is going to be here next week, this camera is fake" and just like I said, the book was in front of the camera because no one ended up moving it.
$C: Holy shit that's hilarious
$C: Ya. Goodwill hunting.

$C: Are you single? 
$C: ahh collector of weird shit, I see. Hello brethren. 
$C: You've perfectly replicated what i imagined the typical Redditors home to look like. Sloth shrine, empty toilet paper role and all. üëç 
$C: You should put up real cameras to monitor reactions to the fake ones.
$C: What is my purpose 
$C: Nice hat. 
$C: I helped build a huge 12 million dollar home for a guy in Utah that sells fake security cameras on the internet. Big business
$C: The OP has a fucking giant Pepe the frog and a gun. christ on a crutch
$C: Who just keeps a gun on a table? 
$C: I have that same stuffed frog 
$C: Your home looks like a hipster exploded inside of it. Also, change the tp. 
$C: I'm fucking crying right now
$C: Well this was perfectly constructed for Reddit! 
$C: ...and made a cool weird video about them.
$C: John Snow in a cowboy hat...hero.
$C: This actually made me laugh a bit. What the fuck is it doing on r/funny?
$C: This is barely even funny I have no idea why it's getting so many up votes. 
$C: CZ75?
$C: No paper on the toilet roll. Bachelor pad confirmed. 
$C: omg dude, you are sooooo quirky!  way to quirk my man!
$C: Add wheels and arms, and then another use for it is to pass butter r/rickandmorty
$C: What a total reddit douche. Anyone see is mirror reflection? LOL
$C: Why am i not surprised that OP wears a fedora?
$C: I‚Äôm just commenting to let you know that your house is filthy.  
$C: So edgy.

Get the fuck outa here ya stupid johnny cash wannabe. 
$C: This is actually stupidly hilarious, now I want to go out and get some of these and put them in funny places
$C: So do you live with your mom and she kept the cutout or did you get the cutout back from her and you just have a cutout of yourself around the house now? 
$C: how does neckbeard this have 143k upvotes? Oh, look at my gun with sloth shrine. I am very cool and badass.
$C: That's a lot of unnecessary hole in wall drilling for interweb points.  You must rent.
$C: IN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America
When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. ‚Äî That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, ‚Äî That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. ‚Äî Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. ‚Äî And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.

$C: Damn, I really need some of those 
$C: Nice fedora
$C: u/emilbogsted
$C: Are you Banksy?
$C: Are you the when live gives you lemons vine person? 
$C: You pass butter
$C: Love the humble brag when you walked up the stairs...made sure that gun was seen.
$C: Jesus Christ man, you're a Goddamned modern Pee Wee Herman. Someone get this dude a drink. 
$C: Geesh OP, do you ever have women guests? Clean yer bathroom -- especially the piss-pools at the bottom of the toilet.

And replace that TP.

If I were a guest in your home and saw that I'd politely nope the fuck out because I'm not your mom.

Honestly, do men think this is a "cool" bachelor look? It's like the home of a toddler who failed at potty training.

Also, LPT: If you're uncircumcised and  don't at least dab your penis a bit after urinating, *your dick tastes like piss.* It's nasty, an unwelcome surprise, and many women might be too polite to mention it.  

Like the other decor, though. 
$C: That hat can go fuck itself. 
$C: Why don't you have any toilet paper bro? Don't forget to put more in the bathroom.
$C: Be careful with these. An old landlord of mine installed fake cameras in front of our apartment. When someone was mugged in front, the cops asked for the footage. Obviously she couldn‚Äôt present any. She got in some trouble. 

Just an FYI. 
$C: fucking congrats dumb ass
$C: I still don‚Äôt understand that shrine of a sloth?
$C: uh... random gun huh? American as fuck, bruh 
$C: That creeped me the F out for some reason...
$C: Someone care to explain, or is it one of those concept only understandable to those with an IQ below 30?
$C: What‚Äôs with the gun shrine?
$C: Pure gold. Those cameras look like they‚Äôre from an era ago.
$C: You have the best post of 2018 thus far
$C: [deleted]
$C: As a real heads up. In most states, having any visable cameras on your property for security purpose make police look at your house like a drug house. In places with no knock warrants, this gives them "points" (a lot of them) toward getting a warrant. I'm not accusing you of anything, most ppl pUT these up to deter crime, but the state/gov't uses that against you. Same with dogs, if they can hear ANY dog bark outside your front door, you get points for that too.
$C: Dude that airsoft gun display is rad
$C: Golf clap, well played. XD
$C: I assume the alter with Jesus and a gun is staged, but then I saw the cowboy hat and what looks to be a stuffed Pepe.  Then I wasn't sure how much of it was real, if anything at all.
$C: That altar gave me a strong "Siberian Education" vibe.
$C: So we're just gonna ignore the Sloth-astronaut Glock Shrine?  
$C: HAHAHAHAHA! (the most intelligent thing I could come up with atm)
$C: I like this guy. 
$C: I like ur hat.
$C: If they were real you‚Äôd find the culprit who didn‚Äôt refill toilet paper. Sorry ahead of time if already mentioned üòõ
$C: wow....there is a lot to unpack with this gif
$C: Dude, you are a walking, talking meme!
$C: Gun is fake, like the security cams,  you could actually be secure spending the same amount of money.  
$C: This is comedy gold! 
$C: You have a bomb ass house my freind.
$C: I came here to rant that these don‚Äôt fool anyone but after actually watching the Gif I laughed so hard and now just want to thank the OP for his creativity. 
$C: Im in my bathroom laughing so hard right now my mates are telling me to shut up
$C: All i can think is that you made a bunch of holes in your walls and that this kind of crap must eat batteries like nothing.
$C: What's with the shrine to the gun at the top of the stairs?
$C: Just a little injection of silly reality here. Courts have ruled against fake camera owners in the past. They ruled that the cameras give an expectation of safety that is not actually being provided.

http://blogs.findlaw.com/free_enterprise/2014/08/for-businesses-dummy-security-cameras-may-pose-legal-risks.html
$C: You are clearly a man-child. And I want to be like you when I grow up (I may be older than you tough).
$C: Best OC all year
$C: dude! refill your TP or you are in for a *shitty* surprise
$C: You just damaged the property by drilling lots of unnecessary holes in the walls. Cool. 
$C: Nice shithole house you loser fucking keklord virgin retard 
$C: He has a Pepe stuffed doll and wears a lame cowboyhat. +1 for rightwing cringelord fuck.
$C: Why would you put a gun that appears to have a magazine in it by a window? Someone can literally break the window and grab it and you would never see their face with your redneck camera set up. I thought americans cared about gun safety.
$C: You just leave your handgun sitting around like that?
$C: Does anyone else think this is misusing the Goodwill though? After all, whatever his circumstance, he took all of them, not just one. He could've left some for someone who might need a thief deterrent and can't afford one...
$C: Why go for fake one when you get real ones ? 
$C: Even if it‚Äôs repost this is freaking hilarious 
$C: In Vegas, everybody's gotta watch everybody else. Since the players are looking to beat the casino, the dealers are watching the players. The box men are watching the dealers. The floor men are watching the box men. The pit bosses are watching the floor men. The shift bosses are watching the pit bosses. The casino manager is watching the shift bosses. I'm watching the casino manager. And the eye-in-the-sky is watching us all.

$C: I was worried those weren't candles...
$C: you mean slothstronaut 
$C: He also had a cowboy hat on. All the evidence is pointing to a drug cartel boss. 
$C: But he ran out of toilet paper
$C: Yeah, well, I have a toilet paper next to my toilet.
$C: But he don‚Äôt have toilet paper anymore!
$C: "Also too"
$C: Yeah but no toilet paper
$C: In the bathroom to see who isn't changing the toilet paper roll.
$C: Talk about burying the lead. 
$C: You need to add some kind of bone or animal remains. 
$C: ..but no TP.
$C: Hey get me out of this fucking suit!
$C: My friend has a koala portrait near the entrance. On each side there are candles. During Christmas  time his mom places these small santa figurines on each side. Except they are like in a small cage. Looks like a shrine it‚Äôs hilarious!
$C: Objay
$C: Do use all ur toilet paper and not restock it for next time, too? üòÇ
$C: This guy just parties. What do you do for fun 
$C: Yes. 
$C: Better believe those lemons are under surveillance.

$C: I need to find me one of those
$C: That's Kevin! Sweet Dee briefly dated him.
$C: When life gives you lemons you     
      
FIND A NEW GOD!!!!
$C: Didn't he give this cutout to his mother or something and then she took a bunch of funny pictures spending time with it?

$C: Let's just hope he's not the "lemon party" guy 
$C: Thank you so much üòÇ
$C: Wait wait wait. Are you also the guy whose mom had a cardboard cutout of him for holiday dinners that you couldn't make it to, and whatnot? And is that the cutout in this gif?!
$C: I don't know if someone else pointed it out, but I'm pretty sure that's Olan Rogers
$C: Well when life gives you camerad
$C: Uh....context for us plebeians. 
$C: Maybe a little voyeurism with them bathroom camras.

$C: Those teeth are so hungry!
$C: He's got baby teeth like Kirsten Dunst!!!
$C: Fucks sake, how does one get so much upvotes from a comment?
$C: This was my exact question after a first viewing!
$C: I love the Pepe Silvia wall he's got going on there.
$C: Clearly you are pretty good at surveillance considering I only see 3. I certainly hope you have one underneath the desk pointing at the groin area?
$C: Please take a picture

Edit: Thank you for delivering, OP! 
$C: In the background. Which murder conspiracy theory is your officemate trying to solve?
$C: Needs more jpeg
$C: The visitors probably think he‚Äôs done some serious shit and needs to be watched.
$C: Is he tracking down Pepe Silvia?
$C: I worked security at an art college and someone put a fake one in the bathroom, pointed it at the toilet and posted a letter about taking student safety seriously. 

We got some actual complaints the first day and someone pointed it up at the ceiling because they thought it was real. 
$C: Do you work as detectives and if so, was your partner close to the case to where the Chief had to intervene with something along the line of "McMaynerbury, you're too close to this case. I'm taking you off" and that resulted in the pictures above his desk with string connected. Or have I just watched way too many movies and no fucking clue what I'm talking about?
$C: Is that a detective-style string chart with picture of Gordon Ramsey on it?
$C: That's my desk. Here's a picture for the reddits [photo] (https://imgur.com/a/RhnEx) of that conspiracy board.
$C: Has he found Pepe Silvia yet?
$C: I love the conspiracy thread wall. I don't know what came first, it or the security cameras, but they go together like chocolate and peanut ~~butts~~ butter.

EDIT - Don't eat peanut butts.
$C: You should joke that the guy is super shady and that he earns a new camera for every transgression.
$C: Was the picture taken with one of the CCTV cameras? I could barely spot the cameras vs other blocks of pixels.
$C: Do you work at dunder miflin?
$C: I can't see the cameras can you provide big red arrows please
$C: You should but one under his desk so it looks like it‚Äôs recording his crotch
$C: *Holy* ***JPEG*** *Batman,* I can see *all the pixels!*
$C: Do you work at Dunder Mifflin?

$C: Halpert is that you? 
$C: Justified was such a great show
$C: You're office seems like a fun place to work
$C: Looks like Charlie's still on the hunt for Pepe Silvia.
$C: For the next one put it under his desk aimed where his crotch would be.
$C: we do the same thing at work! funny thing is guy hasn't said a word about it, we are starting to think he just genuinely has not noticed all the (very obvious) cameras pointing at his desk/chair/in his office...
$C: Haha I've done the exact same thing except I've done it for my own desk because I actually don't have a coworker haha
$C: Needs more PC monitors.
$C: This is like I Spy. I can only find three of them.
$C: based on the photo provided and your comments, it seems like you have a pretty chill workplace
$C: Can we see that action figure collection?
$C: Can i get a picture of your action figures though?
$C: Nice PC, and my, is that Vault Boy?
$C: We had a CCTV camera at my first job at the grocery, everyone would tell new hires they were fake - and then management would catch new hires stealing shit. 
$C: You‚Äôre on Jim levels of messing with Dwight
$C: I‚Äôm more concerned about that conspiracy thing he has going on.
$C: Reminds me of the [convenience store in "Loaded Weapon 1"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgyjTnimZfg#t=23s)
$C: "Yea, we really don't trust dave. we're pretty sure hes stealing from the break room fridge but we just can't prove it.."
$C: The twist? He's suspected of stealing CCTV cameras
$C: How does this not have gold. Lol!!
$C: I can't tell if he has 4 monitors or one of them is just like 5 feet wide....
$C: Who is he stocking/ hunting with that string chart?
$C: I would shit a brick in his office if I didn't know about the camera joke, and swear I was being watched. 
$C: Please tell me there's also one under the desk, pointed at his crotch, to ensure fully creeping out anyone who spots it.
$C: r/gifsthatkeepongiving
$C: It was the one facing the toilet that really got me.

$C: /r/bettereveryloop
$C: I didn't know it was a gif till I read your comment
$C: From that brief reflection shot in the bathroom mirror, I feel confident saying OP looks like the exact kind of person that would have a meme shrine.
$C: I want to discuss it but I'm not really sure what there is to say. I saw it and now I have to live with it.
$C: What kind of animal just leaves the empty toilet paper roll there?
$C: I'm more concerned with the empty toilet paper roll.

If this guy has a GF (not likely, given the slothgun shrine), she's gonna be pissed.
$C: And the life size cut out of himself and giant frog...
$C: Looks like the starting gun in a video game. 
$C: I was taken aback by that until the Thin Mint cereal appeared. Obviously a courageous breakfast adventurer we've got here.
$C: Oh me oh my, OP sure is quirky! 
$C: and the fact he is wearing a hat inside the house?
$C: How about his lack of toilet paper on the roll
$C: no, because that is all he wanted from posting the video.

Praise be the sloth.

$C: You‚Äôre meaning to tell me you don‚Äôt have your mandatory Space Sloth shrine up in your house?
$C: /u/tippr $1.337
$C: I used to do security system installations and once it got cheaper to install cameras with a central monitoring station, more and more people wanted them added.  The newer wireless ones are obviously much easier, but back then, we had to run the line.  This guy wanted the cameras in the dumbest locations, in my opinion.  It looked like he lived alone.  Oddly enough, the easiest way to break into this guy‚Äôs house would have been through a window on the first floor, a bathroom window.  So he wanted a camera above it and facing down.  It basically had a vantage point of the entire restroom.  If someone broke in, you‚Äôd only see his or her back unless he or she turned back around and faced the camera.  Had I been more experienced, I probably would‚Äôve not installed in the bathroom for liability reasons, but I didn‚Äôt think of it at the time.  Surely enough, he calls me 6 months later.  Someone broke in to his bathroom, a couple.  I guess they decided it would be fun to use his fancy whirlpool tub for some sexy time.  It was all caught on camera.  I don‚Äôt know the burglars intentions, if they broke in but then saw the tub and thought they‚Äôd bang first, and then burglarize the place, or what.  But during their adult time, there was a moment where the female looked up and saw the camera.  This is like 720p footage and it was good.  He had to have me come see it, so I obliged.  The look of horror that came over the female‚Äôs face is a look I haven‚Äôt seen someone make since nineteen eighty eight when John McClane threw Hans Gruber off the Nakatomi Plaza, and plummeted four hundred ninety three feet into a concrete slab.
$C: it happened a while ago.. we try not to talk about it anymore
$C: OP is the spiciest meme lord 
$C: Literally everything OP owns is stupid and pointless
$C: The shrine is not scary at all, but the finished toilet paper roll gave me chills
$C: Don't you have one of those at your home?
$C: And the man has no toilet paper. 
$C: Polymer wonder. Probably a 9.  Makes sense to go along with the fake candles.
$C: Where do you have yours? Is the top of the stairs not a good place?
$C: And that hat OP is wearing
$C: I think that's a SIG?
$C: I have that same sloth print hanging in my hallway. Makes me smile every day. Also have a dope sloth [shower curtain](https://www.amazon.com/Slothzilla-Waterproof-Curtain-Climbing-Included/dp/B00I53704S)
$C: It felt like something you would come across in Resident Evil. Wow, a new weapon just sitting here!
$C: It's really hard to tell from the still frames but that looks like a sig sauer p226
$C: OP is way too committed to the joke.
$C: I was crying at that shrine, that is beautiful. I want to go drinking with OP, I bet he is a lot of fun
$C: Show some respect, asshole. 

We're talking about a living legend here.
$C: And I thought I was the only one with a Slothstronaut shrine at home!
$C: Is it a fake gun he bought at goodwill too?
$C: It's like something from a horror video game.
$C: All I could think of was the little hallway shrine in the chiefs house in resident evil 4.
$C: Neil Armsloth died for the pursuit of knowledge you pay your respects.
$C: I have the same sloth on a t-shirt. 
$C: Also, the pistol is laying on a pile of cash... looked like $20 bills, lol. 
$C: Pretty sure that full body cardboard cutout is as picture of himself too.
$C: Do you not have one?
$C: What about it?  I mean I keep my shit locked up and my wife has strong feelings about decorating like I‚Äôm in college, but I‚Äôm down.
$C: I see nothing out of the ordinary there. 
$C: Feels like a far cry 4 easter egg
$C: Or the fact there was no TP in the restroom? 
$C: I must admit I was disappointed that there was not a gun or rifle in each room, especially the bathroom.
$C: That seems perfectly normal to me.
$C: I think based on the meme levels in this house, this man might be that 4chan guy.
$C: This is my actual nightstand next to my bed.

Yes, that is a snowglobe.
$C: It gave me ideas as to what I should do this weekend
$C: Sloth astronaut thank you very much!
$C: No, because thats what OP really wants us to do.  Same with all those other childish things he just so happen to get a shot of.  
$C: Prime r/nocontext material right there
$C: I‚Äôm more concerned with the empty toilet paper roll. That‚Äôs a mishap waiting to happen. 
$C: There are a lot of things set up in his house to add to this joke. Notice the giant cutout of himself? 
$C: Because he's so random and quirky XDD
$C: you don‚Äôt?
$C: Does the cowboy hat not explain enough to you?
$C: What of the toilet paper roll? 
$C: Yeah, no way that was going undiscussed...
$C: Thank you ..!!
Creepy to the maximum level..!!
$C: I would if I could see more than one giant moving pixel
$C: What is OPs house
$C: Never forget.
$C: Why did I have to scroll to the last but one comment to find someone asking this....
$C: Security camera now making sure nobody messes with the shrine.
$C: And all that money *there is a bunch of money under the gun you daft idiots
$C: Why was that not where the three cameras were at???  Something fishy about that frog.
$C: This is what being a bachelor with money is all about
$C: Neck beard things
$C: I tried to make everything as absurd as possible 
$C: Hey he‚Äôs rocking that hat. 
$C: He's already internet famous. Already posted is his When Life Gives you Lemons video, but he's also popped up here before. I want to say one involved sending that cardboard cutout of himself to his family for holidays he wouldn't be attending, and he made some presentation about giraffes.
$C: I mean OP has security cameras throughout his house so I think he's good. 
$C: I liked the hat, pardner
$C: I liked the hat, pardner
$C: Yeah, here I was thinking Lemmy was dead.
$C: He was already on camera anyways
$C: I bought one of these on Amazon after I caught a couple neighborhood kids on my front porch looking in my windows. I made a show of installing it, getting out a ladder and a drill, even standing in front of it and waving like I was testing it out. A neighbor across the street noticed and seemed concerned. I told him don't worry, it's not pointed at his house. Those kids used to walk past my house every day, but after installing the "camera" they found a different route. Even pizza delivery people will ring the doorbell and then take a step back in front of it so it can see them lol.
$C: A good rule of thumb is that real cameras dont have the red light. If it has a red blinking light it's likely fake. 
$C: I think the kinds of people who would steal from a shop are also the kinds of people that would be fooled by fake security cameras.

Edit: To be fair, pretty much anyone would be fooled by one. I'm guessing that shoplifters probably don't treat fake ones any differently from real ones.
$C: We put a fake camera up in our department at work as a prank against our boss. He was furious and ended up dragging over the general manager who didn't have a clue what was going on. But he quickly caught on to the joke and told our boss it was for security reasons. He was not happy when he found out it was a joke. 
$C: Behavioral economics has done a good bit or research about this topic and related work.

Much of what we do is about appearance. For instance, if we were totally anonymous when it came to recycling, most wouldn't do it. Instead we have public recycling bins we put out at the end of our driveway. People don't want their neighbors to see them as the ones that don't have those bins and must not recycle. This causes people to recycle at a much higher rate than if no one knew we did or didn't do so.

In the same way, we act better when we feel we may be watched, even if we know the camera is simply a fake. In the back of our minds, we still think there's a tiny chance it could be real and thus we act better just in case.
$C: It also works if you just put a sticker on your door saying that there security cameras in there.
$C: > camera

[I see what you did there...](https://thepcgames.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Hello-Neighbor-Alpha-4-PC-Game-Free-Download2.jpg)
$C: I like smiling at all the security cameras I see because I want to try brighten the day of anyone watching them!
$C: Also, the flashing red light is a dead giveaway to most crooks that the camera is fake. Disable the led light if you actually want to use it for deterrence. 
$C: He didn't want to spark the over/under debate
$C: I am Kim Jong Un and thus have no need for toilet paper 
$C: What's why the camera is there. Is find out who keeps finishing the roll and not changing it. 

$C: Never trust a man with an empty toilet paper roll, it means last time they took a shit, they stopped wiping not because they were clean, but because they were out of paper and didn't want to change the roll.
$C: Thats nothing. His cabinets have no handles! Monster! 
$C: Plot twist they all function wirelessly 
$C: I think there's a subreddit where you can watch these. 
$C: Please tell me they weren't invited ever again. 
$C: Wow, what a piece of shit. 
$C: Joke was on her...she realized that even if the camera were real, it would have been feeding the video to another source?  I mean, cover it with a towel if you're suspicious, but if it's already too late, tearing off the wall ain't gonna make the captured video go away.  (at least not necessarily).
$C: She paid for the wall and the camera right?
$C: Looks like you passed the limit from where a joke is something that can be shared and laughed at; to a joke that appears as a reverse in-joke that you're tricking people.
$C: Fuck, that ending made me sad. Please tell me you hurt her somehow after this.
$C: He's also a living meme. 
$C: Careful. He might stick a real camera among the fake ones. 
$C: emphasis on the "for a while"
$C: He's so le random! 
$C: for a very short while. like 15 minutes...
$C: Until he didn't change the toilet paper roll...
$C: Yes, but just not too long. 

Because after a while, you'd be known as the guy with a camera mounted in his bathroom facing the toilet bowl.
$C: The best thing about that one is how it's just slightly cocked to one side as if it's smugly saying, "And just what do you think you're doing, hmmm?"
$C: I read couch as crotch.
$C: I would put them inside my toilet  too. 
$C: 29 fake ones and one real one. They'll never suspect a thing.
$C: All I can think of

https://youtu.be/L7RtJ1scnfk
$C: Ok there kreiger.
$C: Or better yet, hide a real camera in the fake camera so you can see their immediate reaction.
$C: I think it‚Äôs better to set it up in the bathroom then film while in the bathroom. The rollercoaster of emotions, from horror to relief when you tell them it was a dummy cam all along. 
$C: Happy cake day :)
$C: you can become a youtube star too
$C: [Nathan For You](https://youtu.be/btJWbVycaGU) kinda did it, the magnificent bastard.
$C: Set one up in one of the bathrooms at work and you would always have one free. 
$C: I‚Äôd put up a camera and get to the bottom of it. 
$C: He lives alone. The empty TP roll came from inside the house!
$C: I think this exact situation was the penultimate reason my previous roommate left. She was an absolute mess, leaving unpacked boxes in the living room for quite literally a year and unwashed dishes in the sink for weeks, etc. She'd leave the empty toilet paper rolls on the sink when the trash is two feet away. After a few months of throwing it away for her, I left a note written on the roll something like "THIS IS TRASH. PLEASE PUT IT IN THE TRASH." Received [this](https://i.imgur.com/rsrH897.jpg) response.
$C: I‚Äôm a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude. 
$C: Yeah the reveal was my favorite part about this.
$C: That triple reveal was gold
$C: OP studied Karma Engineering in college
$C: Nice
$C: Looking what else is in the house, i suspect any girl would be long gone long before needing the johns...
$C: You mean the jig right? Or maybe the camera was looking to eventually make it big in Hollywood...
$C: #!
$C: a surveillance camera?
$C: And the other cameras.

You‚Äôre a dick, prick; a sick hick,  
My voice hasn‚Äôt stuttered.  

So just for the record,  
When you try to rhyme?  
Be willing, and ready,  
To put in the time.  
It‚Äôs not about ‚Äòkarma,‚Äô  
It‚Äôs not about votes.  
It‚Äôs about all the smiles,  
You create with your notes.  

Your fake camera poem?  
Will not be rewarded.  
Drop this shit again?  
Please don‚Äôt record it.  

$C: That's just bananas...
$C: Forget to swap alts  /u/DrSeuzz ?
$C: Sick flow.
$C: A lot of poems get gold. I‚Äôd try but college
$C: Everything was going good until the Shawarma and Karma rhyme scheme attempt...
$C: I think it's quite deserving of the praise.

Oh and it's at 182k now :)
$C: Definitely nailed the cringey part.
$C: I found it compelling and thought provoking. A playful homage to 1984 with elements of a modern Satre/Dali on the surface.
$C: GoodWill
$C: Funny how?
$C: We'll kill him last. 
$C: For you.

$C: Above the urinals, pointing down.
$C: do removable mounting tabs not exist in your world?
$C: You realize it's pretty trivial to plaster over and repaint a hole, right?
$C: Could be using command strips.
$C: Worth it. 
$C: how?
$C: Wow you're like the opposite of my father 
$C: I am also wondering this. 
$C: I think it‚Äôs a cowboy hat
$C: that's called a cowboy hat lmao
$C: Scrolled all the way down here to see if anyone else noticed. 
$C: I think you can doxx yourself yes. 
$C: My ex goes to the same university as you did, I noticed you on the ‚Äúalso study here‚Äù tab on FB or whatever, kinda freaked out because your videos are hilarious haha I was saddened to see we had no mutual friends, but your videos are comical gold man, keep it up! 
$C: please doooo
$C: PM me your snapchat bb
$C: Post the snap plz
$C: I creeped on your posts and found it. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I want hilarious snaps sent to me. 
$C: Still trying to figure it out. Will get back to you as soon as I find out. 
$C: When you finally succumb to the cancer you spread
$C: edit: thanks for the gold!
edit 2: RIP IN PIECE MY INBOX lol
$C: Yeah, you too? 
$C: He is.
$C: i saw that too hahahaha
$C: Really?! So quick to pass judgement on this awesome post, don't you think BFF? I'm glad you went ahead and corrected yourself and gave this post the necessary up vote. My question is, what's up with that alter a few seconds after the video starts and why do we not have one as well? Hmmmm? 
$C: Don't forget the camera watching the camera watching the camera watching the frog
$C: Well yeah hidden cameras don't stop theft, they just help catch the thief
$C: ugh. I know, right? The pepe stuffed doll, the sloth astronaut, cringecringecringe.
$C: That, plus the giant cardboard cutout of himself....

Or is that Bam Margera 
$C: Yeah I was expecting the same thing.
$C: The VCR? I'm surprised they originally had that many tapes needed to to store 24/7 hour video...
$C:  Wait,  what? I am missing something right? Illegal???!!!
$C: I need enough for 20 wipes! NEXT!
$C: I‚Äôm wondering that also.
$C: There's mounts that avoid this 
$C: XD
$C: I'm currently employed by Goodwill , it's usually because most of the  interesting things that come through are  slightly  damaged, so they get tossed, recycled or sold by the pound . everything in good condition gets sold online.thats why Goodwill seems so homogenized .
$C: >Are the really take cameras?

The really yes take 
$C: Ok. I'll admit I don't get the reference. I had to do a double take. Please explain. 
$C: The gun on the table. 
$C: Hand me the butter
$C: What makes someone strange?  What is even strange?  Is it something that is not normal to us but normal to someone else?  
$C: right like come on.. >:( i can't even find the crap i'm actually looking for. 
$C: > electroluxed TO DEATH when flushing


That would suck...

$C: People worried about their safety, but OP probably just put it there for the video
$C: It's ok it's being monitored 
$C: That‚Äôs not a fedora. 
$C: Calling this dude a Johnny Cash wannabe makes about as much sense as calling him a Nicki Minaj wannabe... you're a hater either way, but if you're going to hate, at least make sense with it.

You are such cancer lmao. I bet your life is miserable. And before you try to take shots back at me, yes I use drugs. But everything in your life is much more shameful than that.

$C: Lol wut?
$C: There's mounts that don't require you to make holes and I can't imagine a small blinking LED takes up much energy
$C: It has the sloth astronaut that was floating around a few years ago
$C: Window is obviously not on the ground floor, making sloth shrine impossible to see from outside.

Gun could just be there for the video.

Gun could just be a replica.

Yes, there is "a magazine in it", but that doesn't mean that the mag is loaded.

It's just a joke, who cares
$C: You missed the point. 
$C: So who is watching the eye-in-the-sky?
$C: I'll always upvote a casino reference 
$C: Plus they got about a dozen guys up there, most of them ex-cheats. They know all the tricks of the trade.
$C: So you only need to have someone in the dealers and boxmen to beat the casino.

Since the other levels are not watching the game itself but the watchers. 

The dealer allows the cheat, the boxmen disregard what the specific dealer has done. And no one above knows anything.
$C: Take your upvote for a *Casino* reference. 
$C: you jew muddafucka you


$C: Yes, but do they put an equal amount of blueberries in every muffin?
$C: big brother sees all
$C: Can confirm. Am from Vegas
$C: Take this stiff, and *pound it up your fuckin' ass.*
$C: They‚Äôre onto me....
$C: And even then, some guy robs the place and makes a clean break
$C: People keeping an eye on each other reminds me of a (probably un-PC) joke my barber was telling last time I was there:

Why do you always take two Mormons fishing?

Because if you take one, he'll drink all the beer.
$C: But when the government tries to watch what he was doing that is not fair.
$C: I visited Royal Oak post office a year after the shooting there. There is a supervisor per three people hand sorting, supervisor of the supervisors, dog runs above them with people watching them, etc. etc...I can see how the expression going postal was started.
$C: > I'm watching the casino manager.

Even when he poops?
$C: Besides the elevator
$C: This is essentially what the movie "21" is about. Great movie on Netflix.
$C: Wait.....
$C: But is the picture autographed?
$C: Note to myself: Hundreds of dollars on my property raises the property value. Genius.
$C: Strengthens teeth
$C: That last one with the 3 cameras was fucking great lmao. 
$C: I'm convinced you are the son of Ken M
$C: *You are now a moderator of r/sloths.*
$C: I usually filter out my real estate searches for only properties that have that stuff. I also look for people that have half a sheet of toilet paper on the toilet paper dispenser. 
$C: Put them in semi obvious spots, like eye level when you sit down, then watch people abruptly and uncomfortable adjust as they realize they are being recorded. Then giggle.
$C: Thanks for this tip.
$C: By Hundreds of dollars!!
$C: If someone breaks into your house they will shit themselves and run away.
$C: OP, you're awesome. I just want to make sure you've been told. Carry on. 
$C: Looks like you love thrifting. I keep telling my friends, I'm not a Horder! I'm going to open a bar someday and need to decorate it! 
$C: I see you used the $4.00 from your dad *wisely*.

$C: You have too much time on your hands. You need to fap.
$C: I like you.
$C: What kind of gun was that?
$C: You *consistently* have the best comments in this post. How do you not have a million comment karma?

**^^^^awaits ^^^^amazing ^^^^reply**
$C: Peak feng shui achieved
$C: Is the gun real? If yes, what brand of 1911 is it? Join us if you havent already over at r/guns
$C: Everything checks out
$C: Get this man gold
$C: I love the camera in the bathroom. Lol. I'm guessing the person who used to own these cameras probably got robbed then decided to buy real ones. 
$C: Change your TP roll... You savage
$C: They say that bathrooms, kitchens, and portraits of sloth astronauts sell houses.
$C: It looks like something out of resident evil. Like if you take the gun but don‚Äôt have a replacement for the mold a giant stone will start heading your way to kill you. I want one now. 
$C: What is it with Americans and guns? You have shrine for a pistol? You post it online to show it off?  
 
Very badass.   
$C: Clearly, it's a shrine to the dark lord, what with having Money, the root of all evil, Guns, cause guns kill, and religion, because religion kills. Somehow. 
$C: Not if the gun goes off in said residence. 
$C: Some calipers would be nice.
$C: Lol, here I was thinking he was tripping cause he didn't mention the picture was framed. Good catch
$C: That is no fedora sir. It is clearly an absurdly small cowboy hat which is totally fine and not subject to ridicule according to the laws of the internet.
$C: At least you're closer than all the people who call trillby's fedoras 
$C: I loved your (petco?) Job ad  you posted a while back. Can you post a link for my enjoyment?
$C: Wait so you're the "vines that keep me from ending it all" thumbnail guy who's always on my recommended list?
$C: Praise be.
$C: "When Life Gives You Lemons" is in my top 10 internet clips of all time, well done
$C: "When life gives you lemons, don‚Äôt make lemonade. Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don‚Äôt want your damn lemons, what the hell am I supposed to do with these?"
$C: Can I just ask what kind of monster are you to not replace the toilet paper with a new roll when it goes empty?!  You even have a security camera showing you on the giant wall of camera feeds down in what I imagine is your secret underground lair that the roll is empty... image recognition software should be screaming alerts 6 ways to Sunday about this clear dire emergency.

Also, you have a camera watching the camera watching the camera watching the frog, but *who is the frog watching??*  We'll never know from this video, it ends too soon.

^^/s
$C: Hi. Can we be friends on Snapchat?
$C: Oh my god. I saw your lemon clip when I was dealing with a really low point in my life. It was the hardest I'd laughed in a while, and I appreciated being able to just... Crack up at something like that again. Thank you for your continued sense of humor!
$C: Keep doing what you do, I've seen your stuff pop up occasionally and it's always great!
$C: Dude, I can't get over the music at the end of the lemons video. 
$C: I love you
$C: Wasn't that cutout your stand in while you were travelling abroad?
$C: Nice.
$C: This makes a lot more sense now.
$C: I thought that was Will Sasso
$C: He is risen!
$C: Oh my god! That's my very favorite vine. Makes me giggle every time! :D
$C: Very very very funny

$C: Hey man just want to say this is my favorite video of all time. I watch it at least once a week and refrence it too much
$C: You're my desktop background no homo
$C: The when life gives you lemons video is one of the greatest videos of all time
$C: Well that answers my other questions.
$C: https://m.imgur.com/gallery/h3WFb
$C: The lord hath cometh
$C: One of my favorite youtube videos. Thank you so much for this. You'll never know how much that video has made me laugh.
$C: That must make you the guy who quit the petsmart in an absolutely hilarious way. You are a legend
$C: That may be one of my favorite vines ever 
$C: Can I ask where you bought it from? I work for a company that makes those.
$C: You responded to me on Instagram once. Still living off that high
$C: I did a double take at your cutout.  "Was that him?  It IS him!".  I miss your skits from highschool.
$C: Nice.
$C: That is forever my favourite vine/video. You are my hero!
$C: Belmont‚Äôs biggest claim to fame outside Brad Paisley
$C: My husband loves you and references that damn video so much, it hurts.


You've given me lemons.
$C: Your execution of the "when life gives you lemons" line could not have been better. I love it.
$C: Aha, that‚Äôs my fave vine of all time. Even at your deepest low that video can make your day. Thanks! This post was also entertaining, the end got me hard.
$C: Omg u so randome.
$C: Why?

Ninja edit : is that a life size cut out of yourself???
$C: Was the voice crack intentional? That's all I want to know.
$C: You and your home are fucking hilarious, thank you for sharing with us.
$C: When a simple "yes" gets you a gold you know your a karma god. 
$C: that is my favorite video of all time. I love you.
$C: The when life gives you lemons video is my favorite video of all times! It always cracks me up!
$C: Best YouTube video of my lifetime.
$C: I don't understand this video. Please help. 
$C: OMG! You are quoted daily in our butchershop, whenever someone fucks up they will do the empty stare and say well when life gives you lemonsXD i think i love you
$C: Wow. You look like a real douchebag. How about getting haircut and shave and cleaning up your shithole?
$C: yes to what question?  
are you really the guy?
$C: Keeps those lemon stealing whores at bay

he's seriously the wittiest person i've ever met
$C: It's not a cardboard cutout, but I was in a promotional event and they had a 10 feet canvas print of me and they asked me if I wanted it when the promo ended. Turns out, there isn't many uses for a giant picture of you, other than annoying your roommate by hanging it in the living room. 
$C: And I said CARol CARol 
$C: I got BOXES full of Pepe!!
$C: Would you calm down and have another cup of coffee?
$C: There *is* no Carol in HR. 
$C: one of my co-workers and i always quote that scene. he pointed out to me the other day that Charlie was reading "Philadelphia" as "Pepe Silvia" since he's illiterate. I'm not sure if that was the joke to begin with but i never caught it till he pointed it out, it blew my mind.

$C: Dude's got to be worried they are on to him.
$C: Okay I know I'm way late, but I need to know the what and the why about this board?

$C: Been on Reddit for 4 years. Love finding popular subs I had no idea about
$C: r/gifsthatkeepongifing

$C: Isn't that just /r/BetterEveryLoop?
$C: Beat me to it (because I'm always late to the party).
$C: pronounced 'jifs that keep on jiving'
$C: I particularly liked the set of three facing one another.

I like to imagine a puzzled guest awkwardly trying to pretend they haven't noticed 
$C: Now he can finally figure out who took THE LAST OF THE TOILET PAPER AND LEFT THE FUCKING DEAD ROLL ON THERE
$C: Even if you stand and pee its 1 foot away AT ASS LEVEL
$C: I thought that was a tribute to Krieger from archer 
$C: I imagine him sitting there now and thinking: "In hindsight, it might not have been a bad idea to spend some of the money rather on toilet paper."
$C: I think society is at the point that when we hear laughing from the next stall, we know someone is on their phone.
$C: I genuinely lol'ed progressively more after each one. 
$C: So you stuck your head in the toilet bowl and started cackling?
$C: OP‚Äôs house and life is just a surreal art piece.
$C: No woman has walked these sacred floors.
$C: I would like to add that I put on that hat to add another layer of ridiculousness to the snapchats and that I do not wear cowboy hats in my leisure time 
$C: He's a reddit/internet "celebrity" look at his top posts. He also has a cardboard cutout of himself
$C: https://i.imgur.com/YTmAnzZ.png

snapshot from gif
$C: It isn't just a meme. 
$C: I kinda feel like 'meme shrine' needs to be added to the urban dictionary.

edit: [it is now](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meme+shrine)
$C: You think OP is single?
$C: Check out his post history. All OC, hilarious stuff.
$C: Op literally is a meme
$C: Giant pepe noted
$C: And no toilet paper, with the empty roll left on the holder. 
$C: I think it's all part of the joke. 
$C: And the fact that the toilet paper roll needs to be changed. 
$C: He also has no toilet paper on the roll which is questionable. 
$C: And no toilet paper.
$C: What makes you think [this guy](https://imgur.com/7Zj78o2) would be likely to have a meme shrine?
$C: Girl Scout Thin Mint cereal, too. This guy knows how to party.
$C: That was my thought exactly.
$C: OP knows di way!
$C: OP looked a bit like Lemmy Kilmister. 
$C: Pretty sure that's Wheeler Walker Jr.
$C: R/justneckbeardthings
$C: But have you made your own sloth and firearm shrine yet?
$C: *"I came, I saw, I have to live with it."*

 /u/Robbie-Tsunami
$C: Be strong for all of us.
$C: >I want to discuss it but I'm not really sure what there is to say. I saw it and now I have to live ~~with it~~ for.
$C: [deleted]
$C: That's what the cameras are there to find out. Checkmate, criminal scum.
$C: Sloths. 
$C: The kind that wears that hat and keeps a gun next to a shrine of an astronaut sloth.
$C: I like to think OP did it just so people would point it out.
$C: If he has a GF, odds are she's the one that left it there
$C: I saw this too, but thankfully upon closer inspection OP has enough forethought to have the TP going the correct way.
$C: If your GF doesn't approve of your slothgun shrine you need to breakup immediately.
$C: Whenever the toilet paper roll is empty in my house, it's always the misses' who left it that way.
$C: I went the maintenance man route. No tp plenty of paper towels... and liquid plumber. No I didn't flush the paper towels. Sure you didn't. 
$C: I volunteer as tribute! Yes, I remember you, giraffe bb.
$C: I'm positive thats supposed to be pepe
$C: [The life-size cutout was a gift to his parents when he went to study abroad for a year](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mom-plays-joke-on-son-who-sent-her-cutout-of-himself_us_56faaf94e4b0a372181b0bc0)
$C: That cereal is delicious. 
$C: Came here to ask OP‚Äôs opinion on the cereal
$C: It's super gross. My husband bought a box out of curiosity, I threw it out after one bowl. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: And an ugly hat, at that.
$C: This means he's bald.
$C: It's his just-in-case-a-m'lady-comes-over-accidentally hat.
$C: /r/madlads
$C: And _not_ wearing a suit.  Heavens to Betsy!
$C: [deleted]
$C: That's the real crime here
$C: Don't link bestgunnit. normies go around reporting shit they don't understand and get us branded a hat sub
$C: Shopping at goodwill, man, this guy has MONEY!
$C: We can see 
$C: Needs more assless chaps
$C: No, really?

Thanks for the post. I teared up laughing, made my afternoon.
$C: clearly
$C: I'd watch your youtube channel
$C: You done good, kid.
$C: And you did a good job there.
$C: Motor oil in the bathroom
$C: Refill your fucking toilet paper you heathen! 

Also, was that a cardboard cutout of yourself?  It went by too quick for me to tell.
$C: Are you Lemmy?
$C: The wannabe Bandit Burt Reynolds look really sold that.
$C: Absurd? Wtf? Doesn‚Äôt everyone have a shrine for the famous sloth astronaut, a massive stuffed frog, and a cutout of the lemon guy?!

Edit: Ah wait, now I see the absurdity! Who the fuck leaves a toilet roll unreplaced! You monster 
$C: https://i.imgur.com/mnbY8BY.png
$C: I have a question though 

What time is it?
$C: The hat sells the sandwich.
$C: > Even pizza delivery people will ring the doorbell and then take a step back in front of it so it can see them lol.

That's kind of sweet in a way. 
$C: What about the cameras at Walmart that have super bright, camera flash LEDs?
$C: Real cameras might have a small red glow around it from the IR. You can use your phone camera to see if its on
$C: [deleted]
$C: Reminds me of Home Depot with the cameras that make noises when you are detected. Like yes, I get it, I'm on camera in an area where it is easy to pocket stuff. No one ever is going to look through that video, though. Must be so annoying for people that work there to hear those noises all day long. 
$C: That's why you just don't put a battery in it. Saves money too.
$C: I work in IT (which proves my tech creds, duh) and I‚Äôd be fooled by these. How often do you *really* look at a security camera?
$C: [deleted]
$C: Except for r/shoplifting, since they're really working on turning shoplifting into a science
$C: Fake cameras are a force multiplier. 

You spend $400 on a few real cameras, and then $50 on a pile of fakes.

Especially if you are dealing with assholes who will destroy the visible cameras, you can conceal the real ones so they won't destroy them.
$C: Former shoplifter... I looked for the cameras to know areas to avoid while I slipped things in my pockets or bag. 
$C: Was the angry boss hiding something?
$C: If he didn't want to spark an over/under debate he should have put it up the correct way. 
$C: There is no debate.  I shall solve the issue right now.  Neither over nor under, but a paper towel roll holder, vertical, open topped.  Two toilet paper rolls, one sitting atop the other, one unspooling left, the other unspooling right.  Take from whichever you please, for as you unroll one, it automatically respools the other.  It is a self correcting machine for world peace.  

You‚Äôre welcome, Reddit.  You‚Äôre welcome, America. 
$C: There is no debate. There are people who leave the loose end hanging over and people who are wrong. 
$C: Maybe he's OVER arguing about it.
$C: There is no debate. The [Patent] (http://www.businessinsider.com/patent-shows-right-way-to-hang-toilet-paper-2015-3) has showed this "debate" is OVER!
$C: Everyone here is arguing over vs under and Im still trying to find the motivation to not just sit the roll on top of it. 
$C: And yet there you go...
$C: I'm definitely saving this excuse.  "I didn't change the roll so my guests could have the luxury of choosing over/under."  Nobody will believe me and they will be right, but thats ok.
$C: [Dont you mean under/over debate...](https://imgur.com/a/6kV2Y) 
$C: That only further triggers the front back vs back front?
$C: There is no debate. Either it's over, or you are a Neanderthal.
$C: Well it's on now!
$C: They hate us cause they anus?
$C: Nuke me, Daddy
$C: As you do not possess an anus? Thusly negating you from being anally retentive?
$C: Oh my god has the DPRK perfected the seashell technology?
$C: Then why is the roll empty?
$C: A lot of our guests weren‚Äôt necessarily ‚Äúinvited.‚Äù People just showed up, most being friends, but she never came back after that...
$C: probably what she thought after taking a dump... looked at the camera and instantly thought this holy shit should never be seen by any individual. She took the opportunity to rip the camera off the wall... her only regret, not the fact that this was a fake camera and she just forgot... but that she did not wype her ass, and now her shit smear is over both her cheeks.

/u/tangohotel04 did not invite said person back again, not because she ruined the joke, but because she continued on with her night and stunk up the house.
$C: The camera was an old dummy camera with a blinking LED. I think it cost me $8 when I bought it probably 10 years prior to this happening, so I wasn‚Äôt really *that* mad. A little upset, yes, but not pissed.

As for the wall, I wasn‚Äôt too worried about it because the house was bought under the stipulation that my friend and I remodel it in exchange for extremely cheap (for where I live) rent. So, the whole wall was coming out eventually. In fact, a lot of demolition in that house was done under the supervision of Captain Morgan and Jack Daniels.

But she never came back because quite a few people were upset with her because she single-handed my ruined the joke.
$C: Absolutely. 

I told her that her hair looked bad.
$C: Ah, well I guess "a while" could be an afternoon right.
$C: He let his dreams be memes.
$C: It‚Äôll be the only pointing directly to the toilet
$C: Like a week max.
$C: Neat.
$C: I already did that for you. 
$C: Good grief, Krieger.
$C: Hmmm‚Ä¶
$C: Real fake cameras for sale!
$C: People are OK with being filmed on the toilet for a tv show, just not OK with filming for personal use.
$C: He did
$C: I'm a rooster illusion
$C: [Actually, I'm a horse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izJbgzP1tRA)
$C: Never go full retard. 
$C: Shit, I chose the wrong major. 
$C: You're right. 

Although, hey, maybe the camera came down because it had Hollywood dreams...
$C: Huh?

It‚Äôs just a box.
$C: Psycho Mantis?
$C: While I may not have my name called out by others,

I'll win without a sweat, if I have my druthers.

See, I've battled long before, and I've beaten many foes,

Soon you'll cry "nevermore," like the raven from Mr. Poe.

Your rhyming gangsta rap sounds just like I'm taking a crap,

While I ticka-ticka-tap on the laptop on my lap.

The rhyme replied to mine is a squeal from a swine,

From a boy who wasted time to step to the line.

See, I'm an icy flowing boss, and the line is a crevasse.

DrSuezz stands far across on the side he'll gain a loss.


$C: Who won? Who's next? You decide!
$C: Not my account, but I‚Äôll battle this bloke,  
His face may need fixin, it‚Äôs bout to be broke.

$C: Rita Rudner funny
$C: Funny haha.
$C: Funny weird.
$C: Your moms' bedroom
$C: You can come plaster all over and repaint my hole any day you want BIG BOY!
$C: I've never thought about it, but since no holes were ever filled in my house growing up, I just assumed it was difficult.
$C: They are good enough for MC Hammer, they are good enough for OP.
$C: I could pay you $4.00 in pennies instead of a giant cheque if you'd prefer opposites 
$C: Ive seen it 100 times, but paying almost 6$ for a box of cereal is borderline retarded to me.
$C: [deleted]
$C: No one noticed a fedora but we all saw the cowboy hat
$C: That would be very much appreciated! I feel like missing out here.
$C: this so much.    
   
Ninja edit! 
  
Edit 2: Thanx h8ers XD   
  
Edit 3: m'lady
$C: Yep.

Still a cool phone and video!
$C: Yeah. If something ever happened and the police saw those cameras and asked if they work, and you say no. You get cited for false sense of security. 

Source: my brothers dad. The cop.
$C: *Fake cameras*

I should take my text messages to my school writing center before I press post.
$C: If the hat lowers your chances of getting laid to the same levels that a fedora does, it's a fedora.
$C: So original. 
$C: How am I shameful? I don't owe my parents anything. Precious little snowflakes and ghetto people totally suck. People who try to buy attention from others are pathetic. 

At least I have a decent job and income. Bahaha. 
$C: Funny you should ask.

I was just thinking of going on Cafe Press or something and getting shirts made that say, "I AM THE BULLET YOU ARE ABOUT TO DODGE."

Like a Candy/reflective applique on black cotton, HW.

Thoughts?
$C: It‚Äôs stupid, but the victim of a crime can sue that they felt a false sense of security. They can win too because the act of putting up fake cameras as a crime deterrent shows the understanding of the areas potential for crime. So you‚Äôre better off installing real video cameras or not installing anything at all.
$C: damn, shameless referral link, eh? 
$C: Lost me.
$C: He has a mirror

$C: I.T department.

$C: One person, in a discreet location.

$C: The whore-on-the-floor
$C: > So who is watching the eye-in-the-sky?

The Watchmen. 
$C: Who's watching the watchers... 
$C: Soros of course. Have you not listened to the Trump fans?
$C: There's three ways of upvotin' things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and my way.
$C: I'll always downvote a "I'll always upvote" comment. 
$C: But overpaid tables will be reviewed by backed up video

Foiled

Need a dealer, pit boss, box man, manager, video reviewer, and Steve Wynn

Or just Steve Wynn
$C: You know the three most successful robberies in the history of Vegas?

Number three, the Bronze Medal - pencil-neck grabs a lockbox at the Horseshoe...He got two steps closer to the door than any living soul before him.

Second most successful robbery...The Flamingo in '71. This guy actually tasted fresh oxygen before they grabbed him. Of course, he was breathing out of a hose for the next three weeks. Goddamn hippy.

And the *closest* any man has ever come to robbing a Las Vegas casino...Was outside of Caesar's in '87. He came, he grabbed...They conquered.
$C: Had to leave before he could finish the signature.  
$C: *Neil Armsloth*
$C: Is there documented story attached.
$C: It was actually a tandem bicycle 
$C: It's still being autographed. 
$C: Hundreds of kilos of asbestos doesn't :(
$C: What‚Äôs your address again? 
$C: Bone apple teeth.
$C: What‚Äôs with you retards? You have a video in which money and a fake gun is lined up with money as part of the joke? You post online to show your lack of critical thinking?

Very badass 
$C: But all you get is a wooden bowl.

$C: Also remember to press 6 repetedly for added lemon-effect. no bamboozle

$C: Reddit is a blessing and a curse.  
On the one hand, you have practically unlimited content to browse, and on the other hand, you have practically unlimited content to browse ^^^helpihaventsleptin17daysgetmeoffofthiswebsite
$C: Wow that's honestly impressive. I saw that sub linked a few weeks after joining Reddit and have seen it linked at least 12 times since. Do you not normally sift through comments?
$C: r/sounding
$C: Wow it's suprisimg that you haven't seen that yet, but that's what I love about Reddit. There's so much that you often miss big things in the cloud of information.
$C: Browse /r/all more often and you‚Äôll discover the good subreddits 
$C: No, that's for GIFs that keeps getting better until they loop
$C: And the no toilet paper. Even if someone can tell it's fake, when you're contemplating what to do about no toilet paper, you might be a little extra paranoid. "A...aan...and....Is that a *real* mirror?"
$C: This entire gif is a window into a multi-layered living art exhibit.   I want to live there too. 
$C: r/unexpectedshialebouf
$C: I think I'd like to experience that for a weekend, but not make it my life.
$C: I did that with my first apartment. I think everyone should make their first solo living space into art in some way.
$C: I've never wanted a Reddit Edition of Cribs, until now.
$C: I aspire to this but my wife prefers nerd chic over "weird internet meme chic".
$C: Are we cool yet?
$C: Without toilet paper. 
$C: Lmaooooo
$C: OPS house is one giant dank meme.
$C: You mean your house isn't filled up with memes? Fucking normie you probably have girls over REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
$C: surrealty 
$C: Their were so many things that caught my attention. I don‚Äôt even know what just happened.
$C: I was just thinking this belongs in the r/surrealmemes
$C: This is in fact some kind of new meta thing being experimented on by r/HighQualityGifs, and it just happened to escape into another sub.
$C: NO GIRLS ALLOWED IN THE FORT
$C: (notes empty toilet paper roll)
Confirmed.
$C: Maybe he likes men?
$C: Of course not.  She'd be caged in the basement.
$C: Happy cake day!
$C: I dont believe you.
$C: Another quick question; is that a life-size cardboard cut-out of the 'Life gives you lemons' Vine guy?

I also have so many other questions but I'll contain myself. 
$C: What's your snap chat name?
$C: Oh thank Christ. You had me going for a minute.
$C: Implying that this isn't leisure time...
$C: but you have access to one...
$C: Only at work, obviously
$C: In the first moment I thought you were wearing a Fedora and suddenly the whole thing was less funny. When I took another look and saw you were wearing a cowboy hat, it was even better than before.
$C: He's wearing a hat HAHAHA
$C: How is single life treating you?
$C: Well you need to start.
$C: You should. Totally snazzy.
$C: Given that good looking reflection, you should definitely rock it.
$C: You should.

You should also walk around in a Fraggle Rock snuggie. If those don't exist, have one custom made. This is your life now.
$C: Is that a full body cut off of that vine guy?

https://youtu.be/n_PSKpmSEoo?t=12m50s
$C: Of course, cowboy hats are purely for business
$C: You seem like a very fun person. 
$C: Looked a little too authentic...  Btw I love the giant stuffed frog!
$C: Came into the comments for this here explanation, partner.
$C: Well, that's just a shame.
$C: That's exactly what someone who wears that hat regularly would say...
$C: What's your snapchat?
$C: Is he the "when life gives you lemons" guy?
$C: There is [context](https://reddit.com/r/funny/comments/4cak5u/jokingly_sent_my_mom_a_cutout_of_myself_while_im/) for the cutout, FWIW
$C: His parents seem kinda awesome.
$C: > He also has a cardboard cutout of himself

You don't?? 
$C: Also gave away the camera
$C: One toothbrush FeelsBadMan
$C: IT'S A WAY OF LIFE
$C: Nope, he's married to the game.
$C: Did you not already have one?
$C: Darth Sid
$C: Seems like he is a non believer. All who follow should go to his house and prepare him one or we should burn the heretic 
$C: Guess I have to replace my picture of John Moses Browning with space sloth now
$C: Is is what he would have wanted. Praise be.
$C: Kids, spouses... honestly I don't know if anyone else has ever changed the fucking thing in the entire history of the toilet except me.

And no, setting it on the counter/sink or ON the roll doesn't count!
$C: That frog sure looks suspicious. 
$C: My wife does this all the time, usually right before she gets in bed. So now I just take the old empty roll and throw it at her in bed.

If you're not being passive aggressive, you're doing marriage wrong.
$C: This guy fucks!
$C: Didn't know leaving empty toilet rolls was a gendered thing...
$C: She was going to get to it, relax! /s
$C: I remember in middle school being told I was disrespecting the building by wearing a hat indoors.
$C: [deleted]
$C: A cowboy hat, though? 
$C: IMO I don't think any hats are ugly, just how people wear em can make em ugly or good looking.
$C: Fudge, packer? 
$C: And we're not talkin' about the kind of fancy hat OP has in the gif
$C: But I like hats and gats :(
$C: I shop at badwill.
$C: Especially now that OP has a bunch of security cameras everywhere.
$C: Chaps are always assless. Otherwise, it'd just be pants
$C: Needs more chapped asses
$C: Peanut butter jelly 
$C: When you're making low wages the last thing most people wanna do is make more trouble for themselves
$C: As a former pizza delivery guy, we like to bring joy :) in the form of obesity 
$C: They're decoy cameras.
$C: You mean the black ball things?
$C: They are to get you to look at the camera. That way if you steal something they have a picture of your face instead of a picture of the top of your head.
$C: How?
$C: Many cell phones have IR filters and won‚Äôt catch the IR light. 
$C: Those red LEDs are probably infrared LEDs giving off some visible light
$C: Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, at Walmart they have an actual job where people do that all day, why would you think they don't have the same at home Depot. 
$C: I only look at them to do goofy faces and say hi.
$C: Once worked in a building where the IT guys put fake security cameras outside so they could use the real ones to monitor the community fridge in the break room

Apparently lunch theft is a big deal 

Yes, there were 4 of them, they had the doors covered too 
$C: I stare at them sometimes with a a creepy smile for like a minute or two just to freek out the guy watching them.
$C: I work in security. The blinking led's are a massive giveaway... No real cameras have lights to draw in your attention like that 
$C: About as often as I look at a man's shoes. 
$C: That would be useful in a shoplifting sting or something like that, but putting that in your retail business is just asking thieves to rob you.
$C: He was a brilliant boss. Knew his job inside out and always got the job done, but didn't always follow company policy as it could be counter-productive if you know what I mean? When you're in the same job for 30+ years you get to know how to do things more efficiently.  

It was more a case of the regional and line managers had it out for him at the time, hence his reaction.
$C: [removed]
$C: Hunting 
$C: A man of the people for the people
$C: Why have you not profited from this yet?
$C: What if I just want to re-spool? By spooling one I un-spool the other. Then I gotta spool the other one. Oh wait now the first one is unrolling. I'll never get out of this bathroom alive!

Edit: for the record I do think it's a very clever solution.
$C: but which spool will have priority? the top or the bottom? clearly the better or more used spool should be on top, so that replacing said spool would be quick and efficient. 

If you subject the bottom spool as the primary spool, you're doing nothing other than adding valuable time and effort in the maintenance of said spool.

Let's not even discuss the privileged of being the top spool, it's higher and is closer to the shitter, sitting on TOP of the bottom stool... if anything, this will probably lead to a war between right spool and left spool, a separate demographic and probably more aggressive than the top and bottom roll
$C: yeah and now you have the paper‚Äôs perforation not cutting as easily because gravity isn‚Äôt providing tension.

$C: What makes you think we don't *all* live there?

We're just living in his simulated reality, and he leaked this to us for shits and giggles.
$C: I once lived but a poop toss away from the SUNY Oswego campus in what can only be reefered to as a College Hovel. $280 a month and I lived *the* life of squalor. Upon entrance one had to step over the tree growing through the porch and walk past a card table with cigarette ash try that was sometimes smoldering on the covered porch that simply refused to ignite out of sheer stubbornness or possibility a structural superbug was fending off the flames.

Once inside the foyer, the floor of which was tackier than a Luke Bryan concert parking lot after the pregame affair, you might notice the katana shoved through the wall into the living room holding the sliding door in the wall in place. It was there in 2009 when I moved in and there in 2014 when I moved out.

The livingroom had a rug with a tiger on it that, like the portrait in the Prime Minister's office in Harry Potter, appeared to be fixed in place by some sort of devilry. I couldn't find a single nail, tack, or staple and there was no pad under it but it was fixed in place with what I could only assume was bodily fluids from when it was a frat house half a decade before I moved in.

The kitchen had grey linoleum that turned white after my housemate's drunk mother spilled chicken wings on it Christmas Eve 2010 and sat there crying eating the wings between the shards of shattered plate. Then the kitchen then had white linoleum, who knew?

The utility room was only used for a year because someone barfed on a hammock and in the infinite wisdom the guy who was sort of homeless that was living with us put the hammock in the washing machine where it wound itself around the agitator and burned the motor out.

The upstairs was no better. The bathroom was the largest game of "whoever says something first has to clean whatever it is they are complaining" about you've ever seen which resulted in a 2011 housemate meeting where we taped off the bathroom into quarters and took turns cleaning our quarter for the first time since 2009. I drew the short straw and got the toilet corner. Turns out an attempted doubledecker dropping had welded itself to the wall in the crack behind the toilet.

The bedrooms were kept in various states of putrefaction with mine being admittedly the worst. I had a large plastic case I had duct taped shut in such a blacked out frenzy I removed my shirt as it had become taped to the box itself. From Jan 2010 to July 2012 it sat undisturbed in the back of my closet. When I moved to the master bedroom a buddy of mine made the mistake of taking a peak. It was just soda bottles and mold whose filaments were 1-2" long between the bottles. I still don't know why I sealed it up but we threw it out then.

The master bedroom is where I sunk into true bachelor squalor the likes of which no one reading this has ever experienced. I let it go so bad that the ants infested a pile of pizza boxes and built a fucking nest, queen and all. I discovered the problem when I pulled a spoon out of my peanut butter snack jar sitting on my nightstand and stuck it into my mouth while playing call of duty in the dark only to find it squirming with live ants.

The previous tenant of the master bedroom wanted to see how badly urine could damage a toilet if left unflushed so he pissed in his toilet and shit in ours for 6 months without flushing. The porcelain was a goner. I scrubbed and used everything I could find but it either bound to the toilet or damaged the toilet so badly the porcelain was worn away I don't know.

About then I started dating my now wife and my eyes were opened. Humans were not meant to live in a place where carpets were sticky or where holes in the floor were where we dumped the dust after we swept. There should not be a carpet of dead mice in the basement where a strange heaven and hell scenario had been played out between a morbidly obese cat and all the mice in Oswego.

I realized I was meant for something better, a life where the occasional whiff of bleach didn't meant a housemate was making chlorine gas but that the bathroom had been scrubbed. I was meant to live in a home where a porch wasn't saying "Fuck this I'm out" and was slowly migrating away from the house an inch a way. I was meant for a real home with real floors and walls that didn't recoil from my touch as if even the load bearing bacteria had come to despise the occupants of the home they held upright.

In 2017 I bought a cute house with my wife and 3 months later found out the toilets weren't attached the sewer and just dumped their remains into the crawlspace.

It turns out the house might not have been the problem, I might be the multi-layered art exhibit.

$C: I don't either. Looks too natural and comfortable with it.
$C: He is the life gives you lemons guy
$C: Yes, it is a cardboard cutout of himself
$C: I think OP *is* the life gives you lemons guy
$C: Theorphanmaker
$C: Seriously, because I need this silliness in my life! 
$C: Yes
$C: Yeah spoiler alert or something damn ;)
$C: Is this how religions begin?
$C: Our Glock, who art in heaven, hollow-point be thy name.
$C: My sons both set the new roll ON THE FLOOR. Older daughter is a counter person. Younger daughter is oblivious to the tp situation until she is done going and proceeds to yell for me to get her some. Husband will actually change the roll, but hangs it so it comes from under the roll, instead of the right way. I live with a bunch of animals, basically. 
$C: This is without a doubt the hardest part about marriage and family life.  Three fucking bathrooms, I use one at most once a week, the other two or three times a week, and I use the master daily.  Never fails that every week I end up changing the toilet paper in every bathroom.  Once when I was out of town for two weeks I walked into the basement bathroom to find two empty rolls on top of the empty roll in the TP holder and a roll currently in use sitting on the counter.  My rage could barely be contained that day. 
$C: So true. I cannot remember a single time that anybody I've lived with since leaving my parents has ever changed a toilet roll. At least 15 completely different individuals with no similarities. Closest I can remember is someone sticking a box of tissues in a bathroom as a replacement. As I am inherently an arsehole, started storing rolls in my room, which then mysteriously either vanished or got smaller. Grrr people.

And the damn pyramids of empties that seem to accumulate if someone (guess who) doesn't stick them in the recycling.
$C: Once I found out it annoyed my brother, I never changed it out again
$C: i feel called out
$C: I started hiding the toilet paper and making my boyfriend throw a roll away before he could get a new one. I got tired of always having to go get tp so that only lasted like a month. Now I just continue to throw empty rolls away. One time I got into a a silent standoff and just ignored all the empty rolls to see how long it would take him to throw them away, it was 
fucking insane. There was like 5 or 6 empty ones on th floor, a few on the back of the toilet, an empty one on the holder with two more empty ones resting on top with the actual toilet paper resting on the sink across the bathroom. So I asked him why the tp was on the opposite side of the bathroom and he goes 'there was no room by the toilet.' Throw the fucking rolls away! I put them all on his side of the bed that night. Now he sometimes throws it away.
$C: This gave me instant rage because it‚Äôs so true. I just gave my husband the evil eye due to this thread (I am literally the only one who has changed the roll. Ever.) and I think he‚Äôs a little scared. 
$C: There was an Everybody Loves Raymond episode where the mom freaks out in everyone for not changing the roll.
$C: Not sure if throwing objects at people counts as passive aggressive. But it's certainly the correct way to communicate with your spouse, either way. 
$C: If you want to get very passive aggressive, put it in her purse. She will find it eventually (in public) and question you about it. Just tell her you thought she wanted to keep it because she didn't throw it away
$C: That's because they are retarded. 
$C: https://youtu.be/RtbXJqqzjXw?t=43s
$C: They're flashbang cameras.
$C: Like a decoy snail but for cameras 
$C: Really? So they're just basically electronic mirrors? TIL then.
$C: Cameras pick up IR, human eyes do not
$C: Cameras can see IR more clearly, point a TV remote at your camera and see.
$C: All cameras have IR filters, it still passes through.
$C: Obviously I could be wrong, I'm just based it off of intuition. They have tons of these little cameras in a bunch of different sections, and not only do you have the noise, you also can see yourself on a monitor right next to the camera. To me, it's all a big show. We are not talking big picture, eyes in the sky type of surveillance, this is more like in your face type of surveillance. Is there someone in a backroom watching the feeds of all 30 small cameras? Maybe during peak hours? But during non-peak hours, I seriously doubt that. 
$C: I look at them because I feel guilty of becoming aware of their presence without actively trying. So I make a quick stare at them to hopefully make known the fact that I have nothing to hide. But from that point on, I will forever feel its presence, until I leave the aforementioned pressure chamber. 
$C: Wal-Mart and target checkout cameras are the best
$C: Wait for your wife to change it
$C: I desire no profit aside from the betterment of my FELLOW HUMANkind. 
$C: When an unstoppable force meets an immovable object
$C: In practice, what I have found is that my wife and I instinctively reach for whichever roll is less used.  This seems to happen naturally, and maintains a pleasing distribution between the two rolls.  I am aware that one could inadvertently find themselves in a situation of favoring one over the other, though, and if you found this to be the case yourself I‚Äôd suggest simply keeping your preferred roll on top.  In this manner you maintain ease of use for yourself while also providing opportunity of equal access for any guests. 

For, you see, the vertical dual roll method is one of inclusiveness and equality, as opposed to division and strife. 
$C: I appreciate your apprehension, but in practice what you find is that the friction of the vertical dual roll method actually assists in tearing.  It‚Äôs a sort of natural form of those piece-limiters you see in restroom, but without the limitation or frustration.  Trust me, my concerned friend, give it a try and see for yourself. 
$C: I have never had an inadvertent tear scenario arise, though I‚Äôm willing to recognize this may be a possibility.  You could, for your own self assurance, use a spacer of some sort.  I wouldn‚Äôt think this should be necessary, but the vertical rail roll method is versatile enough to support such addons. 
$C: Just don't let them in the bathroom. Now you can have cats *and* toilet paper the correct way. Problem solved.
$C: I wish mounting the toilet paper backwards would thwart [Mj√∂lnir, the destroyer](https://imgur.com/a/nex9m).   
   
We keep the TP atop the hamper in the guest bath, and the other bathroom door closed. Any hanging TP is a toy to him.

$C: While in college I rented a former very low end brothel with three friends and turned it into an excellent and still legendary place to live. According to our unbelievably shady yet odly reliable landlord he used the place between and the brothel to house 20 to 30 or so semi legal workers from various eastern european countries.

Between the prostitutes and the 40 drunk russians the place was still in a much better condition than what you describe.

As a senior there - 110% believable now
$C: You, sir, need to put that talent to work. I would gladly pay to read a book you wrote.
$C: o.O

$C: If you wrote a book about a half eaten chicken nugget I would read it. You are a very talented writer and this was incredible.
$C: Your wife is a saint. I won't date anyone who lives like that. There's a difference in messy and squalor. 
$C: It is a thing. Shia hasn't let you in on it yet. 
$C: It is no longer unexpected if you know what to expect. Just prepare for that Shia-Surprise. (¬†Õ°¬∞¬†Õú ñ¬†Õ°¬∞)

$C: This doesn't surprise me haha
$C: Okay so he is definitely the type to have that shrine. My friends showed me that video clip and I still look it up from time to time to giggle. Glad to know he still lives a fun life.

$C: > Husband will actually change the roll, but hangs it so it comes from under the roll, instead of the right way.

Time for a divorce. It probably wouldn't hurt to give the kids up for adoption either...
$C: >My sons both set the new roll ON THE FLOOR. 


I lived with my sister for a bit when I was going through some hard times. Because there were two bathrooms in this four bedroom house, my bathroom was the one shared with the kids' rooms. 

Fucking. Toilet. Paper. On. The. Floor.

What makes it worse is that when they took showers or baths, they somehow got water fucking *EVERYWHERE* and would destroy all of the toilet paper in that bathroom. It was the worst.
$C: http://i.imgur.com/7ln7Th3.gifv
$C: Yeah, just go straight aggressive.  Open a new roll of TP and start shoving it in her mouth.  
$C: Yeah, just regular ol‚Äô aggressive. 
$C: Only if they're light object.  I would not, for example, recommend throwing the corningware that she left in the dishwasher at her.
$C: You‚Äôre very skilled at passive aggressive.
$C: I'm doing this. If you don't hear from me, call the police.
$C: I‚Äôm glad I could remember this again!
$C: Til when?
$C: Ah, cool! Thanks.
$C: Ones on most cameras you can see just fine.
$C: They don't have to watch it real time. It records. The presence of the cameras is to deter shoplifters, but the ones who aren't all that bright are on camera the whole time. That file gets turned over to police, who decide to do whatever.
$C: I will sometimes do the casino-style hand clear when I find myself making... lens contact with a camera. Just want them to know that I know, y'know?
$C: Awkward or insane?
$C: Set it on the counter until someone who cares comes along

$C: I think Seuzz's flow is more in line with traditional hip-hop. You can actually put it over a beat. Sprogg is wonderful, too, but the style of writing is very different in comparison. 
$C: Deleting and adding there - just saw it - thanks!
$C: You're eggs, kid. That's all that's left to say. Hope you lighten up

Where can you infer they implied civil suit in their story? Can you point to any evidence in the comment that was what the OP meant, or is it just self conjecture to self serve your argument?
$C: Actually it was a nefarious threat to destroy Washington, DC, by firing a giant laser set up on the moon if the world's superpowers didn't satisfy a ransom of $1M.

$C: I'm pretty sure I said the same thing after I walked out of that movie, and I had already seen part of the scene online before the movie opened. Even after you get the joke ("ha ha they are slow"), the execution is just fucking hilarious and it just...keeps..going.

I think it's going to go down in history as one of the great comedy moments in film. 


$C: I love when he picks up the stamp so slowly that the paper sticks to the stamp. Gold. 
$C: I brought the scene up at an actual DMV and got some interesting reactions from employees.
$C: I'm pretty sure the entire movie was really just a set up for the sloth/DMV joke.
$C: I saw the preview (including the sloth scene) ahead of Star Wars, sitting next to my Type-A, high intensity boss who has absolutely no patience for dawdling or slacking (he's got only one gear, full fucking speed ahead, and expects everyone else to do the same.)  

I could feel his blood pressure rising from where I was sitting, it was glorious.
$C: "Elephant in the room" still gets me. 
$C: I probably would have if it wasn't the scene I had seen in all the commercials for the 2 months leading up to the release.
$C: I thought the scene at the end where they pulled over the street racer and it was him was funny as hell too. 
$C: Who do you think runs all those big business' twitter accounts?

$C: Steven King? Is that the knockoff Stephen King?
$C: Well, there was *The Green Mile,* also known as *The Dread Stream*
$C: I was roundly ridiculed a couple of years back for referring to Stephen King as Steven King. Now it's my turn to continue the tradition *points and laughs*

$C: TVTropes generally has more interesting content (to the crowd that gets lost in internet links in general) ‚Äî it‚Äôs like asking, ‚ÄúWhy is the Onion Book of Known Knowledge more likely to suck people in than an actual encyclopedia?‚Äù

They‚Äôre just made for different purposes.
$C: Speak for yourself!
$C: Well somebody better pick up some toilet paper. 
$C: Pi probably it
$C: You just described how I feel when I see myself naked. 
$C: Did you go to SUNY Oswego and know Blast HardCheese?
$C: It was Christmas Eve 2010 and I was returning from a play at my childhood church. I pull up to the house and there is a Jeep parked sideways on the snowbank in the yard. I'm like "wtf" and walk up to the porch where I see the ash tray is on fire. I dump it into the snowbank and open the door.

Now before we move on for a full 12 months my housemate had been doing impressions of his mother that sounded like [Harvey Fierstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8730rsRoa8c). Let's call him Lance, because that was his name. Lance is gay and that is only relevant because he was hilariously dramatic about everything and reveled in his flamboyant mannerism which made his "Ma Stories" all the better.

I walk in the door and I hear *the voice* say "Oh my god you must be Chris! It's a pleasure to meet you Lance has told me so much about you and who is this tight piece you have here?" 

It was my sister who needed a list to spend the night with some friends of hers and was going to wait with us. My girlfriend had left me for a man with a much larger wiener a week earlier(or one that didn't black out drunk once a week, the truth is lost to time). 

It turns out that Ma and Lance had pregamed here, driven halfway to the bar, pregamed at a friend's house where she tried to get them to do body shots but she's 60 and....really enjoyed the sun. Lance started trying to out drink her to deal with the stress and they all walked to the bar where she bought shots for everyone and got baked down by the river(Old City Hall for anyone familiar with the area) in the blistering cold wind.

The only reason I have all these details is on the rare occasion that I see Lance or anyone from this house we relive this night over drinks. It was the cherry on top of a post-shower-fart wipe smear sundae. It is hands down our favorite collective story.

They got drunk enough Lance was carried out and she drove a buddy's Jeep back to our house somehow still ready to party.

I'm about to die, I couldn't believe his voice for her was so fucking accurate. It was perfect. You could not tell his impression apart from her actual voice one iota.

I said goodnight and ran to my room to also drink and left the smoke filled downstairs to the weirdos to talk about how much they missed Mass.

I pass out an hour or two later then wake up at maybe 3 to a crash from the kitchen. The flat footed stomping of Lance shakes the house as he runs down the stairs into the kitchen where the following conversation takes place with 2 people and 1 voice. I could only infer who said what because I heard the beginning of the conversation.

"Ma! What the hell are you doing?!"

"I'm eating chicken wings what does it look like I'm doing!?"

"But they're on the floor!"

"So what?! Are you too good for the floor now? It's clean it's fine sittown and get me a beer."

"Oh my god the floor is the opposite of clean!"

"Pussy."

I think I laugh cried myself to sleep. The floor was not clean, it was filthy, we had only ever swept it and wiped up stuff that fell with a dry paper towel.

The next morning there was a clear white spot on the middle of the floor and I realized it was white linoleum not grey. There was also a plate of wings in the fridge with a note saying "help yourselves, taking ma home to ct, see you after break." There was visible hair and fuzz on every wing and thigh, it's like he used a dustpan to scoop them up.

That was Christmas 2010 with Lance and Ma.
$C: Haha you and me both. I was a gross human but I guess she saw I had the potential to be mostly ok once she drenched me in lye and hosed me off at a car wash.
$C: Same here. I'll take it for what it was worth, a place to hang out for a few years and realize your home county didn't have jack shit to offer. 

0/10 would not go back under any circumstances.
$C: The truth? I was raised in a low income family with little education and always struggling financially. We were always so frantic to make rent and raise enough food in the garden keeping house was a low priority. A lot of weird habits arise from that kind of environment and when you're raised like that with nothing to compare it to you don't even *see* that there is a problem. It becomes normal. 

Weirdly enough going to Oswego and living there exposed to me to *what could be* and after a few years of goofing off I got my shit together and am now anally retentive when it comes to how I live. 

These stories are just funny to look back on now.
$C: [Here's a video](https://youtu.be/tofGWfM6sJA?t=29) of a clean flush my wife did as evidence of the problem.
$C: Ah shit man you got me we just spit on the floor and rubbed it around a little but I didn't want to seem too weird.
$C: Was it referred to as The Palace?
$C: He was a chemistry major and liked to play with chemicals in his room. I think the worst thing he did was try to make chlorine gas to be honest, everything else was pretty tame, he was an amazing cook though holy fuck could he grill a steak.
$C: Yellow house just off campus, miracles happened there.
$C: Too true. The mix of rural, townies and kids from Long Island was a hoot and a half. 
$C: She is! She stopped visiting after spending a night there and hearing a housemate vomiting from pregaming.

Eventually I snapped out of it, I'm still weird but realized I had been living an unhealthy lifestyle, lost 60 lbs, graduated, found a decent job and settled the fuck down. Nobody can believe I didn't become some kind of patient zero for something I picked up in that shithole. 
$C: Dang, here I was thinking it was a normal Tuesday night.

$C: The best part was the commentary, especially the heavy sigh near the end.

$C: Spelling is herd 
$C: That train of thought is usually derailed by "excessive customer service." As far as loss prevention goes, the cameras with visible monitors work pretty well, but overly friendly and attentive staff work far better. Having those cameras really only serves to have evidence down the road of someone doing more than just pocketing stuff. Think more along the lines of price tag/barcode switching or refund fraud.

Good for your uncle! That damn school saved my life, despite my awful stories of living in crap housing I would not be where I am today with their support staff. I realized that despite being a bit of a weirdo(or creative, take your pick) I could do better than a town with potholes so deep you can see cobblestones.
$C: Nah it's all good, we all have a story to tell, mine is a little unusual but it's got a few good laughs.
$C: Yup, that area could not be accessed without cutting through a drain pipe. The inspector could not get over there and it was just assumed that the toilets would go in the sewer. We're dealing with that this week, other issues were discovered that required a series of quotes to get them resolved.

When you buy a house make sure you have enough left over to have an emergency repair fund. That's made it possible to fix this stuff.
$C: True. All the brown the light touches was poo. I've been sneaking it out in our trash one bag at a time to avoid hazmat fees. It'll all be dirt by spring. Lesson learned don't buy a house that's been flipped, the odds are good the sellers aren't going to be up front with some of the serious problems and since they weren't living there they won't care.
$C: That sigh has been my life for two months as I suit up, go down there, scoop another bag every Thursday night and sneak it into our trash service so they don't get suspicious about why the can weighs a shit ton.
$C:  When did you go there?  They really cracked down on some stuff in recent years. 
$C: Kinky
$C: Of course this is gilded. I mean. It deserves it. But I was still pleasantly surprised.

Also poor cardinal :( That's horribly sad. 
$C: I'm surprised a home inspector of all people didn't pick it up. This is usually their job.
$C: You‚Äôre a great storyteller. Thank you for sharing your suffering and shit with us.

$C: I actually think trolling about his button is the best shit ever. Like troll level 9000 right there. He knows what he's doing too which is what makes the reaction from everyone else so much better. I don't like or support trump but damn if he doesn't do shitposting like a top class pro.
$C: DUR DUR DA PRESIDENT IS STUPID
$C: "Hurr I hate Trump you guys"
$C: >  non existing nuclear button

Nagasaki Japan would like a word with you...

$C: You took the bait hard, son.

$C: You can find the youtube account where I livestreamed a jar of meat for 2 weeks https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkA1SyuiffeLK0GdLs8Rc9Q/featured?view_as=subscriber

Or I suppose you can visit the tumblr where I post exclusively videos of my feet while I take loud shits. http://chriswalkerpoops.tumblr.com

When the day comes you'll know, I am not sure if I never got enough attention as a child or if I got too much attention and am desperate for more.
$C: looks like our kinks line up
$C: Ah. Smart move!
$C: You said ‚ÄúSad.‚Äù at the end of your comment *exactly* like trump and all his supporters. If you don‚Äôt want to come across as a trump supporter maybe don‚Äôt use his grade school mannerisms verbatim. 
$C: Just had the image of Trump doddering off the edge of a 4D chess board, crashing through the layers like a zinc sinker üë∂
$C: I have 3 kids and no monies.

Why can't I have no kids and 3 monies?

*Edit: it's 3, not 2.*
$C: DAE hate drumpf??

E: Issa joke
$C: Ahh, Nagasaki, my favorite holiday drink.  One part egg nog, one part sake.  
$C: to be fair, button technology didn't exist in regards to nagasaki (or hiroshima). they just dropped that shit. 
$C: It's briefcase called the football (carried around next to the president all the time) and a card with a code on it called the biscuit (the president carries this). Then the order is sent out and there's a series of passcodes, keys and locks to get it to go. 
$C: Your taste in male authority figures is... dubious.
$C: Zerogravitycrayon for the fukkin win.
$C: Subscribed. I'm probably going to regret this.

^(last tip didn't go through; my wallet was empty... let's try again)

1000 bits /u/tippr
$C: Lmao, you‚Äôre really reaching for something. One word triggers you huh? All that over one word?
$C: you're doing it wrong.   

NagA Saki.

It's one part Cobra, one part Sake.  60% of the time, it works EVERY TIME.
$C: Some places won't make it... Because egg nog is seasonal. 
$C: you know you're in R/ Funny?  take that technobabble reality crap somewhere else.  :)

Did they just push it out the door?  or was there a ...... button?
$C: Nah, I‚Äôm good. Thanks for asking. I enjoyed having this conversation with your cognitive dissonance on this day. Have a great year.
$C: fuuuuuuuuck
$C: See they tried the "push it out the door" method, but the big bomb was too big, so they dropped the smaller one, then went back to base, installed a button, and came back to drop the big one.
