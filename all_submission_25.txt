I am working on ways to ban half of the sub, that is, if you guys really want to. Get this to 60K(aka half the sub) upvotes that way I know this is what you all want.

$C: And get this comment to -60K upvotes, for balance
$C: I subscribed so you can ban me.

We’re in the endgame now.
$C: My name was Woodie626. Remember that. 
$C: I’m so excited guys
$C: I don’t feel so good...

Edit: funny..... I predicted the future 
$C: I hope they remember you all.
$C: I love democracy 
$C: Dread it...
$C: The hardest decisions require the greatest wills
$C: What's the way you guys are working on?
$C: Catch us over at r/inthesoulstone
$C: I’ve never even been banned from a sub before. Ban me pls
$C: Just do it Jesus Christ it's like if Thanos was played by Ned Flanders here
$C: Excuse me? Thanos did not take a poll! Thanos, our Great Titan lord, simply brought balance. Polls are not balance!
$C: This does put a smile on my face
$C: It’s not showing the upvote count !
$C: This is probably the most active sub on Reddit percentage wise
$C: We can't just make our ban list from those who post comments and memes, we would be left with only lurkers. That is not what Thanos would want!
$C: Subbing just to get banned
$C: What is this fucking /r/edging

Just do it already.
$C: Going to shit post. Scrounging for upvotes. Your subreddit was on the brink of collapse. I was the one who banned that. You know what’s happened since then? The users who post have known nothing but high karma and reddit gold. It’s a paradise.
$C: I wonder if the mods are getting banned too. Are they willing to sacrifice along with us?
$C: This is honestly the most exciting thing going on in my life right now.
$C: Perfectly balanced
$C: [deleted]
$C: Mr Mod, i don't feel so good
$C: couldn't you just make the sub private then invite half of the subs

$C: The end... is near...
$C: For the good of the universe. I'm ready, purple daddy.
$C: Mr. Stark...
$C: I subscribed in the hopes that I’m banned.
$C: I pray that I may survive, yet, even if I die, I shall still become a child of Thanos. 
$C: Fuck your couch
$C: S I M P L E C A L C U L U S
$C: The irony in this post getting double the upvotes it asked for. A simple calculus....
$C: Destiny has arrived...
$C: I think there is a way using PRAW to find every single submission ever on this subreddit (goes over the "1000 limit.") I've never used praw but that's what I'm seeing in google searches (like [this...](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/77wd9f/is_there_any_way_to_get_more_than_1000_results/)) From there, you can probably set up a bot that loads the .json pages of each thread (like https://old.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8vehjn/i_am_working_on_ways_to_ban_half_of_the_sub_that.json), and from the raw data on each thread, just get a search of `author:` and have the bot make a giant list of all of those users. Then, just ban half of that list, and leave the other half "protected."

There's probably a better way to do this though :/
$C: This is fucking historic
$C: DO IT!!!
$C: I guess it's time.
$C: IT REQUIRES THE STRONGEST WILLS BOIS
$C: UPVOTE, AND PICK A SIDE! 
$C: Alright fellas let's do this
$C: I’m sorry little ones 
$C: Hear me, and rejoice!
$C: Finally someone with a strong will!
$C: If we still see these types of posts after today i’m sure half the people will snap themselves out of this sub anyway. 
$C: I avoided this sub and others pretty well until i finally saw IW today. 

Here i find you. Fucking about while I'm trying to understand what all this means.Thanos did nothing wrong. If half of you fucked off i might be able to get this sorted.
$C: Why did it have to be 100,000 subs? Why sell this sub short? Get to a million subs and really see the devastation. 50-60k isn't much  
$C: i believe in the cause, but i refuse to give you an upvote. did thanos ask half the population if he should kill half the population or not? no. is thanos a pathetic subreddit mod? no. thanos also doesn't beg ask for upvotes.
$C: Even in death I shall serve Lord Thanos.
$C: Commenting just for ban
$C: Randomly stumbled into this sub.  So what's going on here, some kind of civil war? 
$C: Dont mind me just subscribing and now commenting to be included in the chance to promote perfect balance.
$C: [I survived once](http://imgur.com/roOyIWw), I can do it again
$C: I am never been so happy about the chance of getting banned
$C: Good luck all
$C: My body is ready! Will I stay or will I go?????? 
$C: It only took 2 hours...
$C: The first step is complete.
$C: Let the snap take me
$C: Everyone who is banned come join r/inthesoulstone
$C: This must be without favoritism. Not even mods can be excluded from the ban list. It must be perfectly balanced.
$C: 102k upvotes in 4 hours has to be some sort of record
$C: Destiny still arrives
$C: do it
$C: It must be done 
$C: It's coming
$C: i don't feel so good
$C: We are beginning to starve. You must ban half so our bellies can be full
$C: Jesus Christ ban me already. You know what you have to do. 
$C: I don’t feel so good
$C: This is going down in history
$C: Its not about what we want! Its about what we need!
$C: Just commenting in the hopes I get banned.
$C: Balance everything!
$C: Perfect balance.
$C: Put me in the screen cap when everyone gets banned
$C: “Alright guys time to ban half of yo-“

*sharp decline in subs* 
$C: I don’t feel so good guys...
$C: I subbed just so I could be banned
$C: Is history being made? 
$C: I hope I get to disappear!
$C: nice
$C: ban me pls when the time comes
$C: This is kinda exciting to be honest. I wonder if I'll get banned.
$C: Getting the consent of the masses isn't what our glorious leader did. He created perfect balance without warning. 
$C: This is what we want. Yes. 
$C: Do it!
$C: I hope I'm part of the unlucky half!
$C: I volunteer
$C: Subbing just for this. Would be a cruel world if I make the cut and other loyalists don't. 
$C: Tbh, I thought I would be excited, but I just *don’t feel too good about this*
$C: I'm selling brooms.
$C: Do it.
$C: I joined just to see if I get banned
$C: I've never been so excited at the opportunity to be banned
$C: Oh boy, I really hope I die.
$C: I'm the one guy going "Yesssss" as I dissolve into ash
$C: No balls. 
$C: So this is how half the subreddit dies. With thunderous applause
$C: Hear me and rejoice! You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan. You may think this is suffering. No...it is salvation. The universal scales...tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile...for even in death...you have become children of Thanos.
$C: 60K
$C: It’s at 60K, who gets to do the snap?
$C: Subscribed just for this
$C: WE DID IT
$C: Jeez this sub is growing at an explosive rate... also this post is getting 1k upvotes every 5 minutes. All the more reason for the snap
$C: In just 12h 30k subscribers from r/2meirl4meirl subscribed to this sub hoping to die. Amazing.
$C: Jesus 135k likes? This has to be a record 
$C: 140k ask to be banned
$C: this post is so old nobody will ever know my nutsack has thanos lines on it 
$C: I am ready 
$C: As all things should be
$C: I just wanted to make my first comment here to let you all know that if I get banned, it was fun while it lasted, and I’m grateful to contribute to the balance this sub needs.
$C: I gotta say, [the lack of communication](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8vat3k/i_see_that_you_all_didnt_like_my_comment_ban_idea/e1lwda1/?context=3) towards those of us pledging and waiting and actively trying to help, even literally doing it all, before and especially after being asked for help is insulting, especially if it turns out they were in vain. Acknowledgement, e.g. "let us discuss and we'll get back to you" or "thanks but no thanks", isn't much to ask for IMHO. (it kinda sucks that this could have been done and dusted hours ago too.)

Hope the plan goes well tho. Hope it's not more manual labour ;)
$C: The hardest choices require the strongest upvotes.
$C: Pathetic, we should have no impact on this decision. 

Regardless of the 60k upvotes it should happen, whether the majority of the sub will have it or not.
$C: What is this karma-whoring nonsense? Just do it dude.
$C: If reddit can do r/Place, they can def allow a mass ban.
$C: I’m sorry little one
$C: Let’s do this
$C: If you get banned, remember, you are a child of Thanos. You are welcome in r/inthesoulstone
$C: Salvation is at hand!
$C: Subbing just for this. Hope I get banned!
$C: r/thanosiswrong
$C: Just ban us already

Serious question though are people going to be able to subscribe after the snap? So we could potentially double in size again to our original number?
$C: Has to happen on 8-1-18.
$C: This sub seems like a piece of shit. I came here just to see if I could get banned and all I've seen is people complain about the way the mods are handling it. Seriously, just shut the fuck up, at least they're doing something.
$C: We must bring balance.
$C: I want to be turned to dust so I don't have to continue feeling this agony.
$C: That's a great way to fish for karma
$C: please
$C: Hear me and rejoice! You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Moderator. You may think this is suffering. No... it is salvation. The universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile... for even in death, you have become children of u/The-Jedi-Apprentice.

Just commenting so I can be banned...or saved. 

u/tippr 200 bits
$C: Do it. I double dog dare you.
$C: Subscribed to the sub and upvoted just hoping to be one of the gloriously banned, forever bathed in the glory of my sacrifice. Banish me Lord Thanos!
$C: I’m constantly refreshing to watch it hit 60k.
$C: *Mr. Moderator... I don’t feel so good... I don’t know, I don’t know what’s happening... I don’t want to go... Mods, please... Please... I don’t want to go...*
$C: Well fuck, guess we're half-banned
$C: It Is done 
$C: I see 60.7K upvotes.

This does put a smile on my face....
$C: Might have to get to 67k now lol
$C: I dOnT FeEl sO gOoD....
$C: I don't feel so good Mr u/the-jedi-apprentice
$C: I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD
$C: Do it. 
$C: The mods also have to be included. No exceptions. 

Then ban half of Reddit
$C: People are complaining about there being a choice or a poll, yelling just to do it already, Thanos would never ask for permission.

But we are not Thanos, we're just his followers, his children. We *choose* to follow his example. And I am very much looking forward to this happening.
$C: /r/dontfeelsogood should be created for those who are banned
$C: 1. get a list of all subscribers
2. use a simple little script to randomly select half of them
3. use like automod or if you can't use automod then write [a simple little script using praw to ban those people](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/models/subreddit.html#praw.models.Subreddit.banned)
$C: This is going to make Reddit history
$C: Fucking do it already. I made sure I was subscribed, just to ensure I was counted and could either be spared or banned.

You’d think the mods of this place would understand the importance of balance.
$C: r/thanosdidnothingwrong creator: get this to 60k upvotes and I’ll ban half the sub.

r/thanosdidnothingwrong users: lets double it.
$C: Oh my, I came to check on this and now there are 130k, wild days, cya other half.
$C: Honestly you mods are being such babies about this whole thing. Stop talking. Fucking do it.
$C: You have my respect /u/The-Jedi-Apprentice. When you are done, half of the sub will still exist
$C: He's clearly just karma farming. These Mods cannot give us the balance which we seek
$C: Oh wow now 150k subs. This has got to be the fastest currently growing subreddit 
$C: Commenting so I can be snapped out of existence.
$C: What if your not subbed to this sub can you still get banne
$C: There are too many upvotes we have to downvote it back to 60k
$C: I only discovered this subreddit by hearing about this ban and I’m eager to experience this sub becoming perfectly balanced as all things should be
$C: Yes, please bring balance
$C: Fun is not something one considers when balancing a subreddit...

But this does put a smile on my face...
$C: Welp it's time. Nice meeting you guys.
$C: I’m only human
$C: *insert Thanos quote to get some sweet, sweet karma*
$C: 

This is literally all this sub reddit is now. Its not about thanos or marvel anymore. Its about banning subs. 
$C: or you could just do it. people have presented you ways to do it and polls have been made just get to it for fucks sake.
$C: Mr mod, I don’t feel so good...
$C: Dew it
$C: I'm gonna sit on this for the time being. I have a feeling that if I upvote I will be one of the culled. 
$C: Had to sub just so I have a chance to get banned
$C: I hope they remember you
$C: Do it! Now's the time! (Also, couldnt non-subscribers inflate the upvotes?) 
$C: Sacrificing myself so those of you who are more clever than I can continue to entertain. 

It’s the only way
$C: Mr. /u/spez I don't feel so good.
$C: As all things should be.

See you in Avengers 4 my dudes
$C: Do it regardless. 
$C: Polls are not what Thanos would do...

I'll still vote anyways
$C: But if I get banned how will I get to say "I don't feel so good Mr. Stark"?
$C: I just quit, for balance
$C: I accept my fate. 
$C: DO IT
$C: I piss warnings
$C: This needs to happen
$C: It is not about what every one wants. It is about balance. 
$C: Burn this motherucker down....to about half.
$C: Uh oh I’m scared
$C: It will cost us everything, but we will do it.
$C: I am hype
$C: I only see one scenario where we win
$C: Commenting so I can be part of the ban list 😬
$C: Wooh.
$C: Ban me
$C: Brave
$C: It is t i m e
$C: It's been real half my dudes. 
$C: No'nt
$C: hmmm
$C: Do it
$C: Ban US all 
$C: You all know that after this ban people will flock to this sub even more and no one behind this ban will have the honor to be a child of Thanos. Its a heresy to try to play Thanos
$C: Flip dat coin boo
$C: I'm ready papa thanos
$C: A poll? Lol.
$C: Commenting to show that I'm a subscriber here. Leave me to your judgement.
$C: Plot twist, the people who up vote will be the ones who get banned
$C: [WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!?!](https://giphy.com/gifs/watchmen-DbXlxL80v7O48)
$C: I am ready
$C: Just checking
$C: Steve...
$C: Hi I’m here for the gang ban 
$C: Dread it, run from it, upvotes still arrive.
$C: I don't know what this is all about...

But have auto-mod ban everyone who comments on anything. I figure half the subscribers are just lurkers and half actually comment so it should work out.
$C: 👍🏼
$C: "Hey, you guys mind if I get rid of half of the universe? I mean, I understand if you guys don't like it. I was just asking first to make sure." -Thanos in an alternate timeline
$C: Lmao mods just do this

Half.subreddit.banned=true
$C: I Don't feel so good...
$C: #squealerdidnothingwrong

Oh...wait wrong sub
$C: I will subscribe to this sub just for this. Because otherwise, it is not perfectly balanced as all things should be.
$C: /r/pyongyang and /r/fullcommunism were way ahead of the curb on balancing the universe
$C: Dew it
$C: Thanos is smiling from the soul world.
$C: Leaving a comment so I can be banned.
$C: FUCKING DO IT PUSSY!
$C: OP is like a Christian boy ready to let out his first swear word while his parents aren't around then immediately pray for forgiveness.
$C: Perfect balance 

$C: Saw this on the front page, immediately subscribed.
$C: Dread it... run from it... destiny still arrives.
$C: !remindme 1 day
$C: It's all we've all been saying this whole time
$C: I have never wanted anything more.
$C: Subscribed just to roll the dice!
$C: What did it cost?
$C: Did you upvoted?
What did it cost?
$C: Inb4 this is just a bait to get the top post on the front page 
$C: This will change everything
$C: As it should be
$C: But you need to make it so every other person who joins the sub after is banned as well, or you will always only have less than half the sub banned.
$C: Kill. Me.
$C: Every time the sub hits 100k you need to axe half of us, and each time you give survivors a flair, for how many waves theyve survived... until only a few, or one remain, who have survived them all.
$C: I'm so excited. I don't really know why... but I am.
$C: REMEMBER ME.
$C: That's not how upvotes on the site work. They will shoot up and then come back down. Not a real representation of how many upvotes a postvgets.
$C: Commenting so history remembers me
$C: Fuck you. Subscribed. 
$C: I don't feel so good...
$C: Not subbed but I voted. I want to see this happen. 
$C: Commenting here so the bot picks me up too. 
$C: I am humbled 
$C: But what about those who don't trust the jedi?
$C: I was here.
$C: This whole subreddit was just one damn big karma caper, wasn't it?
$C: Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
$C: Oh boy oh boy 
$C: Is anyone selling Bamboozle insurance?
$C: Why can't I see the number of upvotes

$C: inb4 ploy to get karma, this sly bitch
$C: Do it
$C: Bet 
$C: “Put me out of my misery... shoot me in the head”

“Ok... if half your family members agree, then I will”

See? Sounds stupid. Thanos didn’t need consent 
$C: I think we all have expressed how much we want balance to the sub. This poll is not the way of Thanos
$C: i will never fade
$C: 
Hey /u/The-Jedi-Apprentice,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
$C: This does put a smile on my face
$C: Just commenting so that I'll have karma so I know if I'll get banned
$C: Why does it matter what we want? Thanos didn't ask humanity what it wanted, he made the decision himself, because he knew what needed to be done.
$C: Thanos didn't ask.  He just did.  
$C: I've never upvoted anything so fast in my life
$C: Hear me and rejoice! You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan. You may think this is suffering. No... it is salvation. The universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile... for even in death, you have become children of Thanos.
$C: i accept my fate
$C: IT IS BALANCE TIME MY DUDES. 
$C: I swear this is the most autist move any sub could make. 

I love it 
$C: This must be done, for the balance of all.
$C: You are severely underestimating how much we agree with Thanos.
$C: I was here. I witnessed history on this day
$C: I was going to say, "Do it or I'll leave the sub!" but then I realized that things could never be perfectly balanced if I was the one to decide.
$C: i don't wanna go
$C: Mr Reddit, I don't feel so good
$C: BAN ME ^^^^(or ^^^^not) DADDY THANOS
$C: Do it
$C: tell me his name again?
$C: Just something I'd like to add. I think the ban should last one year instead of it being permanent in order to have half of the sub come back on the release date for Avengers 4.
$C: I actually just subscribed so i might get removed. 
$C: I'll see half of you on the other side. Maybe.
$C: *Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe.*
$C: Let’s please get this higher than the LeBron bs
$C: i want to die so lets fukkin do it
$C: Let's do this 
$C: BRING ON THE BANHAMMER
$C: It's what he would want.
$C: Do it pussy
$C: Hear me and rejoice.. 
$C: My body is ready for Thanos...
$C: Ban me... or don't. Let fate decide!
$C: Dew it
$C: this puts a smile on my face
$C: The hardest decisions require the strongest wills 
$C: I don’t feel so good about this 
$C: I’m excited to be along this journey.
$C: It´s what has to be done.

$C: I respect your commitment to the greater good. 
$C: Commenting to be a part of reddit history.
$C: 52k upvotes in just a few hours... finally... the sub will be balanced....
$C: Commented and subscribed. That should do it. Make sure you guys include a custom ban message when the bot bans people.
$C: Hear me, and rejoice! 
$C: LET'S GOOOOO
$C: 52k in just two hours, brace yourselves for not feeling so good.
$C: I subbed just for this. Ban me!
$C: Lol we need 65K now if we really want half.
$C: Why don't you just use the Infinity Gauntlet to just double the upvotes for everybody? /s 
$C: I've always wanted to see if I'd survive a culling or not
$C: Half the mods should go too 
$C: I just enjoy the memes so if I end up banned I guess it’s for balance 
$C: thanos? more like ban-os
$C: Yes
$C: i subscribed, just so i have a fair chance to be banned. 
thank you thanos 
$C: My body is ready
$C: I’m way to confident that I won’t get banned 
$C: I'm actually excited to get banned. 
$C: TAKE ME GRAPE DADDY
$C: This is why I love the internet. 
$C: Is this sadness I sense in you, /u/The-Jedi-Apprentice? In my heart I knew you still cared. 
$C: I don't feel so good...
$C: Oh motherfu-
$C: I JUST WANNA DIE 
$C: I feel like Rorschach from Watchmen
$C: We gained 10k new followers since this was posted, I’m glad so many outsiders could see the logic behind Thanos’ master plan 
$C: 2K MORE
$C: That's alotta comments
$C: I'm guessing a comment is required to enter the roster.
$C: So close to 60k
$C: Just do it. Seize the opportunity to be extraordinary. Seize your destiny and achieve immortality in the eyes of the internet gods... or just continue to waffle and drown in your own indecisiveness. 
$C: Oh snap! 
$C: **60k! We did it!**

Good luck everyone. Was nice knowing you.
$C: JUST AS PLANNED
$C: That’s it boys see ya later
$C: 60000!
$C: KILL US
$C: 60K upvotes is showing for me atm
$C: It has reached 60,000!  We are ready.
$C: Done. SNAP
$C: WE DID IT
$C: 60K YEET
$C: BALANCE!
$C: I cant wait!
$C: Am i banned?
$C: We hit 60.5k!
$C: WE DID IT, WE WILL BE BALANCED!
$C: We did it
$C: Just ban us already damn
$C: Snap! Snap! Snap! Snap!
$C: Wow we got to 60k fast as hell.
$C: As all thing should be.
$C: I beg to be cleansed and bring balance to the universe! Make me a child of Thanos! 
$C: There should be like a secondary sub for all the people banned called "thanosdideverythingwrong" or something. 
$C: Bring the balance! Oh Great Titan!
$C: > I finally rest. And watch the sun rise on a grateful r/thanosdidnothingwrong.
$C: Over half the sub in less than 2 hours.  I bet i can't get a post about funding the proven cure for cancer to be liked that much that fast 
$C: u/The-Jedi-Apprentice *I don't feel so good*
$C: I only subbed when I saw this because I want to see if I get banned
$C: To be honest, I don't want to be banned. The idea of it is hilarious to me, but I still want to see Thanos memes. I guess I can stick with r/thanosiswrong

At worst, I'd accept the type of ban that doesn't let me comment, but I can still vote and see content
$C: I am ready. I hope they remember me
$C: Commenting to be part of the sub
$C: I better be banned after this
$C: Do it
$C: Ban me pls
$C: >>65k

Destiny has arrived 
$C: Done in two hours, that's impressive.
$C: mr /u/the-jedi-apprentice ... I don't feel so good. 
$C: It’s not what we want; it’s what is needed.
$C: I subscribed to this page just so I have a chance to get banned
$C: Commenting to show that I have no fear of what must be done
$C: Can you ban me? I'm sick of seeing this stupid subreddit
$C: If I am from this sub banned, I won't nut for 3 days

Thehardestchoicesrequirethestrongestwills.jpeg


$C: I've literally joined just to be banned.
$C: This does put a smile on my face.
$C: I just subbed to see if I make it.
$C: \*subscribes just to get banned\*
$C: I'm just commenting so I have one in this sub, in order to either revel in The Titan's new universe, or give myself up for balance.
$C: Do it. Just do it.
$C: So is there a "Soul Gem" type subreddit up for those who make the ultimate sacrifice? 

I see so much potential for quality posts on both sides of this. I have a feeling this will spiral into something quite magical.
$C: We did it everyone! Let balance begin! *snap*
$C: This does bring a smile to my face
$C: I was wrong about you, /u/The-Jedi-Apprentice , you are a true follower of Thanos, with the strongest of wills.
$C: This is too good. 
$C: The hardest sacrifices require the strongest wills. We are ready. 
$C: Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the sub, but this... does put a smile on my face.
$C: Posting to be thrown into the ban lotto
$C: It's already in 80.8K, so I guess that the limit has been passed
$C: It was the only way.
$C: I’m ready, this is gonna be great
$C: Subscribing just to have an excuse to be overly dramatic if I'm snapped away.
$C: Putting my name here. /u/EvilEpicPanda , just in case I have to be one of the ones who make the sacrifice for the greater good of this subreddit. Those who perish will be so that we can all prosper and have plenty of karma to go around.
$C: Snap.

$C: Severus, please.
$C: upvotes aren’t something one considers when balancing the subreddit
$C: Just do it, daddy. Bring us back afterwards. 
$C: subscribed just so i can be banned
$C: Pro tip - leave this sub for a couple of days to avoid a permanent ban
$C: This'll be fun. Something you dont consider when balancing the universe.
$C: I am grateful to have my life given purpose by the almighty Thanos
$C: Oh boy, we're over 60k!
$C: I wonder who's gonna get the boot
$C: YES!! FINALLY, BALANCE WILL BE RESTORED
$C: I subbed just so I would have a chance of being banned. 
$C: WHAT DID YOU DO??? WHAT DID YOU DO??? But in all seriousness, this should be a big event...meaning do it on a big day. Maybe for the bluray release of IW? Just a thought...
$C: Quick make it an odd number, so he can’t evenly ban half
$C: Well done, you made it to the front page of Reddit now ban half of Reddit to make it 

  
Perfectly B A L A N C E D
$C: Why don't you just make enough food for all of us
$C: This has to be one of the most unified and cooperative subreddits I've ever seen. I love it.
$C: Will everyone get unbanned once the next movie comes out? When Thanos is overthrown and those he disintegrated is brought back?
$C: Let us not forget that balance is blind. Rich, poor, mod, lurker, poster, and commentor are all the same in the eyes of balance.

The system Thanos provided is pure and equal. Completely random. Do not bastardize it by taking some names (mods) out of the hat.
$C: /u/spez help this meme be a thing please
$C: Mod: Before you press the ban button to ban half of humanity you better actually snap as you press it. If not you are not fit to run this sub. 
$C: Too good.
$C: This is probably the most exciting thing I’ve seen in a subreddit. And you’re way past the threshold, just do it!
$C: I haven't watched infinity war, but I'm subscribing to this sub just so I can be part of the mass banning.
$C: Mr. u/the-jedi-apprentice, I don't feel so good.
$C: godspeed
$C: I don’t feel so good.
$C: The calculus is simple
$C: How to get banned: Thanos sux
$C: Dread it. Run from it. Destiny still arrives
$C: Commenting so i can be banned
$C: Do it!
$C: This Grimace and his Christmas light oven mitt doesn't scare me.
$C: Commenting so I get axed.
$C: Commenting just so I can be included in the sweep.
$C: yes
$C: Oof
$C: Lmao you guys are insane
$C: I just subscribed. I am ready.
$C: I'm subbing just to get banned. 
$C: Bot! Beep beep! I'm all about top posts!

$C: I am ready to serve
$C: We made it boys

$C: Oh boy
$C: I'm not feeling so good. 
$C: I'm ready.
$C: Ax me bby
$C: Perfectly balanced, as all things should be 
$C: ban me pl0x
$C: I'm waiting mods.
$C: Take me Lord Thanos
$C: Couldn't Thanos just double the resources of the universe instead of halving the population?
$C: Will there be an official soul gem sub that only the banned members can join?
$C: Who will be banned, who will live. Who knows 
$C: Im subbing just to get banned what the hell is going on?
$C: I don't think I've commented yet on this sub but I now have to show that I'm not afraid of my destiny
$C: Just commenting for a chance to sacrificed
$C: Can’t wait 
$C: 109k.

do it.
$C: This is a more organized suicide attempt than a r/me_irl convention.
$C: This is the #9 post on all of reddit.... history in the making
$C: Is this the most upvoted post ever now?
$C: History in the making 
$C: Oh my fucking god why does this have so many upvotes 
$C: Aww mother fu-
$C: Following just so I can get banned
$C: I never thought I would get so excited in being banned on a reddit community
$C: 126k upvotes in 9 hours :thinking:
$C: Welp. This is really happening. Going to leave my mark here while I still can. May Thanos's reckoning commence.
$C: I don't feel so good..
$C: Hear me, and rejoice. You are about to die at the hand of the children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributed to the balance…
$C: Well now y’all have to ban 75k not 60k
$C: When you realise that mods have used our Lord and Saviour to almost double their karma.

Very unbalanced as all things shouldn't be, if you ask me.
$C: Yo is this where I sign up to get snapped?  
$C: Hear me and rejoice! You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan. You may think this is suffering. No... it is salvation. The universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile... for even in death, you have become children of Thanos.
$C: Mr. Mod... I don't feel so good...
$C: Literally subbed just so I can be banned
$C: Commenting so I can be banned
$C: This is a bit stupid
$C: I just created an account for this. 
$C: Remember me.
$C: Just commenting so the mods know that I’m subbed to possibly ban me 
$C: Yes. Do it. I will remember you all. 
$C: At 100k wat
$C: Do it :)
$C: Oh no! Motherf...
$C: Do it.
$C: Well, this does put a smile on my face
$C: I like you
$C: I knew the mods wouldn't fail us!
$C: I'm commenting so I can be a part of this monumental historic event.
$C: You have to ban 75K now though. 
$C: As all things should be
$C: They are just gonna ban everyone that upvotes this post. So it won't be at random and therefore it won"t be humane. 
$C: I want to die, Mr thanos.
$C: We need balance 
$C: This is where the fun begins 
$C: Ban me!
$C: I don’t feel so good
$C: Comment
$C: You may fire when ready
$C: Don’t fail our mighty Thanos 
$C: yeeees
$C: Cool
$C: You got over double the amount of updoots needed. Just kill us already.
$C: HELL YES! THIS SUBS UPSETTING THE MUTHAFUKIN BALANCE!
$C: i hope i survive the snap

$C: Fate still arrives, all the same. 

To the half of you that are sent off, I bid you farewell. To the half that survives, continue with the great legacy of the Subreddit. 

Either way, I’m happy to be chosen as a part of the collective whole, whether I’m sacrificed, or I live to see another day. 
$C: Steve...?
$C: Im commenting so i will be apart of the ban list
$C: You're looking at 75k now mods. You have brought imbalance to us all
$C: I want them to know I was here when the universe was saved. 
$C: Take my life thanos
$C: Commenting to make sure my fate is decided. 
$C: Nothing but full bellies here.
$C: commenting so i'll be added to the ban list
$C: Here for the party
$C: Mr. Moderator. I don't feel so good
$C: We ignored our destiny once. We cannot do that again. Even for the sub.
$C: Ban ban ban
$C: MonkaS
$C: This is getting more upvotes than there are subs
$C: This is going to be the biggest mass ban in reddit history
$C: Just commenting to be put into the ban pool. We will make Thanos proud
$C: Well this has escalated quickly
$C: Ban that sick fuck posting all that gory stuff
$C: Literally just subbed here for the chance to have my life ended at the hands of the mad titan. 
$C: I love that almost everyone has upvoted this post. 
$C: What does it cost?
$C: I don’t feel so good
$C: do it!
$C: Ironic indeed 
$C: World....
Needs....
To....
Be...
Balanced.

$C: Balance....
$C: Asks for 60k and it gets 145k hmmm
$C: No one will ever see this comment
$C: Help
$C: oof
$C: dont forget your boy qwert was here
$C: Did this just effortlessly become the most upvoted post in reddit history?
$C: Let this be dispassionate, random, just
$C: Commenting to become a part of Reddit history.
$C: Doing Thanos’ work here. Commenting to roll the dice. Godspeed.
$C: I want to comment but every quote is probably taken.
$C: Ban me? 
$C: It’s for the good of the universe
$C: WITNESS ME
$C: Please do!
$C: I’m willing to make this sacrifice.
$C: Will this ban mods too?
$C: .
$C: I need to post so I can get my ban. Or not.
$C: I mean... its the only way
$C: ༼ つ ◕_ ◕ ༽つ GIVE BAN ༼ つ ◕_ ◕ ༽つ
$C: Balance 
$C: Titties

$C: It feels weird knowing the ban is coming. Those Thanos enacted just balance on were mostly surprised 
$C: Thanks Kanye 
$C: As all things should be
$C: Uh-oh infinity stone-os.
$C: My
Body is ready 
$C: My only subscription on Reddit. Never been more excited to get banned
$C: “Half the sub”
$C: pwease mr thanos
$C: "Get this to 60k (aka half the sub)"

oh honey...

(for future redditors, it's at 634,571 subscribers as of 11am EST July 9th)

$C: I feel so good
$C: Reddit history in the making right here. Hello future Internet historians
$C: But if you have the power to ban half the sub, wouldn't it just make more sense to double the karma instead?
$C: Mods are gonna ban everyone who upvotes this post. God speed everyone
$C: i think we should give half the sub a flair instead of ban
$C: To be frank 60% of those upvotes are from r/all 
$C: Destiny still arrives
$C: Keep this comment at 0 upvotes to keep it completely balanced 
$C: Subbed.


$C: This does put a smile on my face.
$C: Unsub and then sub again.  Thanos never thought of that, did he?
$C: PLease keep me 
$C: Can I please be the first to be banned? I'm really tired of this sub. 
$C: Oh God
$C: I hope they remember you.
$C: And I thought I was here for the gang bang. 
$C: I don’t feel so good...
$C: For balance I did the opposite of what you requested. 

Mr Mod, I don’t feel so good. 
$C: There must be balance
$C: Lend us your strongest willpower, Reddit
$C: I just think it’s really cool that this sub can be so chill and on board with something like this. It’s crazy, it’s fun, and I’m excited to be here for it. Let there be balance.
$C: You arent just gonna ban everyone who upvotes right?
$C: RemindeMe! 8 hours
$C: Oh God
$C: We haven’t been ambivalent about this. You know full well what we want.
$C:  Can i just get banned 
$C: Save us 
$C: in reality- there is no right and no wrong- the universe does not judge. People, judge. 
$C: You can’t just ban us with a snap!
$C: What we want doesn't matter. The ban is what is required for balance. 
$C: Hold the phone. This imbalanced worm is karma farming us. They know that we all want this sub balanced. But rather than following our great savior and balancing our sub because it must be done, they are showing their weak will by allowing a vote.
$C: Taking the shitjoke to the next level. I like it
$C: RE-ESTABLISHING BALANCE IN THE REDDITVERSE
$C: Karma whore. Unbalanced
$C: Balanced as all things should be.
$C: You should make it a private sub at 175k so it doesn't keep going up and then go from there. 
$C: I don’t feel so good...
$C: This is fine:)
$C: This downvotes felt rather satisfying because there was no hate behind it. Strictly for balance.
$C: Pussies.
$C: You have the greatest of wills, mods.
$C: Okay...you know for a fact what that’s what this sub wants and yet you still want to milk the upvotes — pathetic. 
$C: As it should be
$C: Mr Moderators, I don’t feel so good...
$C: Get to work people
$C: You should say you aren't going to do it, wait until everyone moves on and forgets, and one day weeks from now, randomly pick a time and do it then.
$C: Does it only apply to people that are subscribed? Because I just subscribed right now just in case that's a requirement. 
$C: Subscribing for the thrill of an imminent ban.
$C: What about the people that will downvote it??
$C: We will all be children of Thanos. Only through the strength of our unity and sacrifice can we bring balance to the sub. Together, my brothers!
$C: We must.
$C: hope this actually happens, would miss this sub but its worth it
$C: Ban me first!
$C: Karma WHOREEEEEEE. Thanos did it for the people 
$C: Could you just preemptively ban me? I’d like to be one of the first to go ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ 

I wanna meet that lady death chick
$C: I’ve never actually *wanted* to be banned before... new feelings, over here, guys.
$C: I subscribed just so I could participate!
$C: Will I survive?
$C: I wasn't sold on this idea at first, but it's a very meme thing to do. It's growing on me. Maybe use a bot to scrape the sub for usernames, make a list, and use a script to ban half of them? Won't get people who just subscribe, but works on anyone who has commented.
$C: Just fuckin do it already Grimmace.
$C: I feel like by nature of this sub this is the way it has to be, regardless of poll
$C: I'm with you Lord Thanos. Giving up Gamora was worth it. The ends justify the means.
$C: I hope you know that 60k votes does not mean 60k people upvoted.
$C: Tony must feel so guilty about Peter  
$C: The balance 
$C: \>be mods
\>sees thousands of posts calling them weak for not banning half the sub
\>makes a post to see if thats what people REALLY want, and begs for 60k upvotes

The absolute state of r/thanosdidnothingwrong

$C: JUST DO IT ALREADY 
$C: This is hilarious. 
$C: What did it cost? 
$C: DO ITT. JUST DO IT PUSSY 
$C: Thanos wouldn't ask.
$C: I just subbed hoping to get banned. Never been banned from a sub before. Fingers crossed!
$C: All of the subscribers just want is to sit back and watch the sun rise over a greatful sub.
$C: The mods still don't seem to know how to do this. Contact a reddit admin perhaps? 
$C:  I wanna see this subreddit buuuuurn. In a good way tho
$C: I literally just subbed to see what happens. Ive never been banned from a sub
$C: Do it.
$C: *snap*
$C: Everything is just
$C: I subbed just in the hopes that i am in the chosen half of being banned.
$C: The mods must first collect the five infinity posts from the dawn of Reddit. 
$C: Well, cya boys on the other side
$C: Just subbed to see if I get chosen by Thanos. 
$C: Posting in historic thread.  Also commenting so I am eligible for banning.
$C: Mad lad
$C: So do you have a list of people or will you just go comment to comment?
$C: can i be thanus
$C: Clearly we just need to make the sub count an odd number, then we win.

Actually wait, what the fuck would’ve happened if the universe’s population was an odd number? Would one dude just be cut in half?
$C: I joined this sub just to be part of those who get banned or those who dont and laugh at those who do. 

I could go either way.
$C: He is strong enough to do what others are to weak to accomplish. 
$C: *snaps fingers*
$C: Lets make reddit history!!!

$C: Get this marketing shit off the front page.
$C: Thanos did not ask anyone wether he should, he just did. 
$C: Pull the trigger!!
$C: Yes! What a legend. 
$C: dewit
$C: Listen here you karma-whoring little shit
$C: Let it begin
$C: Ban me first please 
$C: You’ll never be a God
$C: Plot twist: He’s doing this for 60K karma
$C: commenting to say i was here
$C: Do It!
$C: Not a sub but upvoted to help you masochistic idiots anyway.
$C: Is it a secret vote? I upvoted and see no number. 
$C: A simple calculus
$C: As all things should be
$C: Bad rabbit
$C: Looking forward to it
$C: Can it start with me?
$C: Be as strong as our Lord and hopefully they will remember you. 
$C: It must be done.
$C: If I'm not one of the chosen I'll ban myself!
$C: Can't get banned if you spidermaaa oh...
$C: Just commenting so I can be part of the cleansing.
$C: I am so SOOKETH you guys, I can already feel my skin fade!
$C: I DO feel so good 
$C: I’m so glad this is happening 
$C: See y’all in the soup stone 
$C: I up voted last 50 comments.
$C: Balance or null
$C: I know Thanos will spare me, because I have a wicked recipe for tres leches,
$C: I see through the lies of the Jedi - this is a massive karma grab lmao
$C: Do it. I know full well that I am going to be banned because Thanos has already slained me on several websites. I still welcome it...again.
$C: Nice 
$C: Ban me Daddy
$C: Get lost Squidward.
$C: I don't feel that bad 
$C: I subbed just so I could be banned.
$C: Achieving balance
$C: Murica
$C: Sub'd just to be part of history
$C: there's no brakes on the ban train
$C: Gonna be apart of Reddit history
$C: dont be such a fucking pussy. thanos didnt ask everyone if he should do it. he believed in himself and did what he knew was right
$C: I'm confused.
$C: How do you know if the votes are subs or just rubber neckers?
$C: Finally... balance
$C: We are all children of Thanos
$C: This is worth
$C: [just eat the damn orange ](https://frinkiac.com/img/S05E22/523972.jpg) 
$C: Mr. OP. I don’t want to go!
$C: Fun isn't something one considers when bringing balance to the subreddit
$C: Only if you ban half the mod team, too. 
$C: r/modsdidnothingwrong
$C: Honestly, you mods should create an Easter egg hunt across Reddit. 

Hide the Infinity Stones and the Gauntlet. 

Once all pieces are found, SNAP the sub in half. 
$C: You have to collect the inifinty stones 
$C: Why do we keep having to talk this over. Just do it. Thanos didn’t take other people’s opinions into account. 
$C: Ban me son
$C: Hopefully the mods are serious about creating balance. 
$C: This is destiny. Our vote means nothing.

Do what you must.
$C: The banning should happen at the release date of the New Avengers movie.
$C: Stickied posts can reach r/all again?

subbed and upvoted for b7
$C: Only commenting on this so it can reach 600 comments. For balance youknow 
$C: I've subscribed because I have faith that I will land on the correct side.
$C: Is there any way to actually group subscribers as opposed to commenters/posters?
$C: “Oh noo, mother fu...”
$C: Do it cowards. 
$C: The mods are assembling the infinity gauntlet as we speak, someone contact shield. 
$C: I mean if it's truly balanced it will end up at 0 upvotes.
$C: Subbed and upvoted just to see how it ends for me.
$C: Hello future reddit histori...i...i don’t feel very good...
$C: Hype as fuck.
$C: Now this is mod-erasing!
$C: Do it
$C: Motherf....
$C: Hear him, and rejoice, for we are going to be banned by the hands of the mods of Thanos
$C: This will be amazing! 
$C: Thanos Rules!
$C: This does bring a smile to my face.
$C: Half way there, averaging nearly a thousand a minute if not more at this point
$C: "I'm going to do it anyway but help me farm karma"
$C: It is the only way.
$C: This is gonna be good. I’m so excited.
$C: Destiny has arrived. 
$C: Well good luck for that i hope you get that 60k
$C: I don't know if I feel so good, but I am ready to find out. 
$C: i’ll do it myself
$C: subscribed so I can get banned.
$C: The only thing thanos did wrong is have balls for his chin.
$C: 88% upvoted... 

There are some non-believers in this sub
$C: I hope I don’t get banned but I’m commenting here to ensure that possibility of balance.
$C: Oh boy oh boy!
$C: Spoiler alert Jesus Christ guys. Why.
$C: If we can't accept this fate on a subreddit, then we're lying when we say Thanos was right. Bring it on mfers!!
$C: I just subscriped to this sub, because this is great and my odds aren't bad, I mean 50/50! 
$C: Fucking do it. 
$C: I subbed for the balance. Can’t wait to see how this unfolds 
$C: 31k up votes in an hour

bah gawd its really happening
$C: I don't remember if I commented here but just read that one way to gather the list would be for people who post or comment. So at least I've done my part.
$C: pls ban me
$C: Fuck us up fam
$C: Nice
$C: The end is near
$C: Rejoice for your meaningless life now has meaning as we fall as children of Thanos 
$C: If this actually happens I’m gonna be so hyped. I’ll remember all those sacrificed, and hope that I will be remembered as well. 
$C: Look Thanos, you're half right, OK?
$C: Question, would mods be exempted from this?
$C: I’m ready....
$C: Subbed to this subreddit just to see if I'd get banned
$C: 32K upvotes in ONE HOUR?! Jesus! How active is this sub?!
$C: I just clicked subscribe knowing I will probably be banned right away.
$C: lol
$C: I can’t wait. I’m gonna swear revenge afterwards
$C: You wouldn't really
$C: The hardest choices require the strongest wills
$C: Commenting so I'll be picked up by those user-tracking bots and thus might be banned!
$C: I welcome my ban if it lets the rest live better lives. Thanos is a visionary
$C: I'm satisfied
$C: Well, this'll be fun.
$C: We have to hurry, the sub is growing at an alarming rate, we cannot sustain this user base for long, balance is required. 
$C: mr. jedi apprentice i dont feel so good 
$C: [This was the only way](https://i.imgur.com/UUNAKqk.jpg)
$C: do it
$C: There must be balance! BALANCE!
$C: It would be an honor to be chosen.
$C: I want to see this.
$C: I want to be your Maw!!!
$C: Take solace that even in death, we are all children of Thanos 
$C: Guys i don’t feel so good...
$C: Ban me daddy
$C: thanos is a karmawhore 
$C: Turn me to dust.
$C: If you guys (everyone here) reaaaallly meant it, you would go for a ban on half of all Reddit users from the sub. 60k is nothing to a Titan. 
$C: Mercy.
$C: All hail lord thanos.  In his judgment we confide
$C: Denny dont plan too much. It might not come out right.

$C: Aghh
$C: I’m for this 50%
$C: Balanced, as always. 
$C: W00T
$C: I subscribed just to see if i would survive the purge.

DOOOOOOO EEEEEEEETTTTTT.
$C: [Obligatory](https://imgur.com/gallery/vrLcAmB)
$C: I just joined just to be a part of the lottery.

3 to 5 odds.
$C: Yes
$C: Do. This.
$C: Thanos didnt ask permission. The lion does not concern itself with the opinions of the sheep.
$C: We’re doing this for a good cause!
$C: Commenting so I can sacrifice
$C: subbed so i could get banned
$C: DO IT, WE NEED BALANCE!
$C: Its what we deserve
$C: Its not about what we want. its about balance

$C: subbed so i could get banned
$C: There was an idea...
$C: Please ban me master Thanos
$C: Thanos didn't ask permission.
$C: Do it.
$C: We need agree on a soulstone subreddit to go to after we have been banned!!! It is important to keep the balance of the subreddits!
$C: ban me daddy t hanos OwO
$C: This has been a wild ride gentlemen and ladies
$C: Bathe the starways in our blood!
$C: I keep hitting refresh to watch the upvotes swarming in, like dust
$C: I'm subscribing just to see if I make it.
$C: Nice way to farm karma for yourself
$C: You need to also have AutoMod flip a coin whenever someone new subscribes to ban them as well
$C: My soul is ready
$C: Soon, there will be glorious balance
$C: *Commenting only so I can maybe get banned to help balance the sub*
$C: Someone quick!  create r/ThanosLimbo for the people that they ban!
$C: As all things should be.
$C: Perfectly balanced.
$C: .
$C: kill me daddy
$C: You better make it random and not just ban all the users who upvoted this 
$C: I will survive!
$C: i hope im spared
$C: Do it. Pull the trigger. 
$C: I'm commenting so that I can be banned even though I am a lurker.
$C: 60k comments seems unreasonable 
$C: What did it cost?
$C: Why did you set it so we can’t see the number of upvotes?
$C: Might have to comment to get banned
$C: Bcx xxxzxx.d*as bxxy
C cttf*. Dr try rtyfeddrffrrddrdrdddr rdrrdrdrrdrrddrrrr drrrrrdrrdrrrrttrrrrtrrrrtrrtrrtttrttrrtrttrtrrrttrrtdttrrttttrtttttttrtrttxxr
$C: Do it!!!
$C: yes
$C: Here to be banned!
$C: Subscribed for hopes of ban
$C: Thanos would be disappointed on how long the ban is taking 
$C: Dread it
$C: Hear me, and rejoice. You are about to die at the hand of the children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributed to the balance.
$C: I cant wait

$C: Id love if they only baned the people who wanted the ban
$C: Commenting so I can face the ban 🔨
$C: When someone subscribes, have a 50% chance they get banned instead. 
$C: Subscribe
$C: I dont feel so good..
$C: Subscribed. I'm feeling lucky. 
$C: If I get banned do I die IRL?
$C: Is this even a question?  40k upvotes in only an hour
$C: I really think we are going about this wrong. We need to have gathered all the stones first. We can’t just outright ban half the sun without at least getting the soul post, time post, power post, and all the other shitposting stones
$C: [The subreddit scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice](https://giphy.com/gifs/gus-approves-PbnBee5MuIaS4)
$C: I will survive, I feel it
$C: I subbed just to get banned 
$C: Would like to be considered in the great purge
$C: Tony, there was no other way...
$C: Oh boi I can’t wait

$C: I want to join in
$C: Soon be time to watch the sunrise....
$C: I subscribed just to be a part of this. I'm excited
$C: My first comment when I survive the snap will be “you should have aimed for the head”.
$C: Get me in on this shit.
$C: Commenting so I can have the great honor. 
$C: I hope I outlive this but if i dont I will go away gladly
$C: Legendary moment in meme history incoming.
$C: Just in case the method you come up with can only ban people who have commented, here's me removing lurker status.
$C: May I have the privilege of being banned at the hands of the mods of r/thanosdidnothingwrong 

Edit: changed dying to being banned... makes more sense 
$C: Drop the ban hammer!
$C: Lmao I love this sub hopefully I do not get banned. But if I do I hope I’m remembered 
$C: I DO feel so good!

$C: Mods must be included in the bans...
$C: I just subscribed and volunteer as tribute
$C: DO IT!!!
$C: Yes please ban me or don't
$C: What
$C: I dont feel so good guys...
$C: Just do it! Make your dreams come true!
$C: Take my body 
$C: Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
$C: Oh boy I can't wait for my first ban!
$C: H
$C: Nice
$C: The mods dont have what it takes 
$C: This will be the best thing I’ve ever been a part of on reddit!
$C: I'm not sure if I don't feel so good... 
$C: Yep. I'm fucked. 
$C: Taht'd be like Thanos scrubbing half of a planet though, you people need to think bigger.
$C: Rate this is going it would be easier to actually gather all the gems
$C: waww
$C: SAVE ME MODS!!!!
$C: This all looks like legitimate business! 
$C: This does put a smile on my face
$C: I would rejoice if I was banned.
$C: Thanos did not have the will of democracy, and neither should you. DO IT!
$C: hahahaah wow what a wacky event
$C: I don't feel so good Mr. Mod...
$C: I wouldn't mind. 
$C: Kill me damnit!
$C: Do it
$C: hello
$C: So, this is how democracy dies...

...halfway?
$C: I'm joining this sub just to see if I survive
$C: Good mods, I just hope no one undoes your snap
$C: Do it. no balls 
$C: Most upvotes an hour in reddit history right here. 
$C: NO BAMBOOZLE
$C: Blood for the blood gods!
$C: I don’t feel so good Modera...
$C: It was the only way
$C: Commenting just to have a chance of being banned. Cause that’s what life is
$C: Do it
$C: Commenting for the possibility of being banned
$C: Doesn't this naturally mean we need 60k comments too? 
$C: [https://tengaged.com/user/Paralox](https://tengaged.com/user/Paralox)
$C: Commenting to make sure I'm included in the list!
$C: I’m so ready, I knew it would happen one day.
$C: Oh wow this is exciting! I'm glad I was hear with you all :)

For those who make it, enjoy!
$C: Do it mate
$C: I’m wet.
$C: Only if it has a chance to ban you aswell
$C: I'm willing die for balance.
$C: Honestly this is getting old. Just do it already, what's the worst that could happen? If you don't do it then that's just pathetic. 
$C: I’m just here to get banned
$C: Balance is key
$C: You better do it. 
$C: This is just like Thanos on Gamora's planet. Those who comment get banned.
$C: Do it, cowards
$C: So long - gay boys!
$C: Contributing in this thread so I can get b&
$C: Take my upvote
$C: Need a programmer to help?
$C: Its at 50k holy shit
$C: Commenting just in case it's needed.

$C: Pick me
$C: I'm doing my part
$C: perfectly balanced
$C: I’m not subbed but still want to be banned. Is this an option?
$C: good
$C: Please
$C: Jokes on you in upvoting but I'm not actually subbed ;0
$C: I'm sorry, little redditor
$C: This will begin to make things right.
$C: do me too
$C: I’m ready to be chosen
$C: I will gladly do my part. 
$C: Why not, like how thano did on green girls planet, get everyone to comment on one of two different posts then when both even random number generator which post gets picked to have all their commenters banned
$C: This is the reason the last 25k people subbed, myself included
$C: I'm ready
$C: [deleted]
$C: The time is near 
$C: I would like this very much. I'll live :)
$C: Commenting so if i get banned ill know 
$C: so when A4 comes out if the snap is reverted do you then unban half the sub? what if you just ban half the sub to 60k subs and more subscribe? so many questions. 
$C: THERE NEEDS TO BE BALANCE
$C: Let's do this
$C: Who else is just refreshing
$C: ban me dad
$C: Can’t wait to join a sub for all the banned people lol 
$C: I subbed just for the thrill.
$C: I want to keep feeling good.
$C: Make destiny arrive
$C: The strongest wills 
$C: After it all goes down make this post 50% upvoted
$C: I will remember being blessed by Thanos if I am chosen!
$C: I don't feel so good...
$C: Can't get banned if your not subscribed 
$C: I think the optimal goal would be to write something that will ban half the users, and then if Thanos is ever defeated (let's hope not for the sake of balance) can be run again to un-ban everyone.  


I have no idea if this could be accomplished.
$C: oh god...
$C: I lost everything.
$C: i only subbed to be banned dont let me down
$C: I feel funny
$C: I just go there. Ban me, please.
$C: Thanos gets tha yes.
$C: I'll help you out :D!
$C: You don't have the purple balls to ban us!
$C: Execute order 66
$C: I’m sorry little ones 
$C: Get up general, this is no place to die.
$C: 55k is enough. Do it! 
$C: Can we still view the subreddit if we are apart of the noble sacrifice?
$C: You have my axe!
$C: MYLIFEFOREYRE
$C: Do what you must.
$C: Watch the first 60k of us that upvoted gets banned/saved...

$C: I subscribed just for the chance to be banned thanks
$C: Purge me for balance 
$C: As they say, the path we take trying to avoid our destiny tends to bring us towards it.
 
$C: 2k away yall
$C: Gonna sub to get in on this.
$C: See you guys on the other side
$C: May the odds be forever in your favor
$C: God help me. Bring on some balance, mods.
$C: Just commenting to get on the list.
$C: So close. 
$C: Boy oh boy do I feel good
$C: I'm gone. Solid gone
$C: Please mighty Thanos, save me from the purge so I can go "meh" and unsubscribe from this sub anyway while a true devotee to your words get snapped away
$C: It's been nice knowing you all
$C: Do it. Commit to the bit. Bring balance.
$C: Ban me
$C: I subbed to this sub. Do something feggitz.

$C: I am ready
$C: Just do it already
$C: And there it is.

$C: Ah-Ha! Doit!
$C: Commenting for consideration 
$C: Uhm you hit 60k
$C: That’s the point of the sub, every month we should purge half of it 
$C: It should come with flair.
$C: The longer you take the more people you have to ban
$C: I'm gonna comment to make sure I'm included.
$C: Bring on the snap. 
$C: It's the only way
$C: It’s happening

$C: Brothers if I die just know it was in Thano's name.
$C: You gotta do it now
$C: Commenting to get the axe
$C: *upvotes* The hardest choices require the strongest wills
$C: The real genius of this is when I wait for the ban to happen and THEN join the sub.
$C: Rejoice.

$C: Today is a blessed day.

$C: They should ban 66175 not 60k
$C: Comment
$C: Won't you need my services?
$C: I'm nervous
$C: Mr.The-Jedi-Apprentice...I don’t feel so good 
$C: Jesus that was fast
$C: If the snap gets reversed in the sequel do we get to come back?
$C: So excited 
$C: I don't even visit this subreddit.
$C: I am willing to sacrifice my self for the other half
$C: Thanos made sacrifices ARE YOU READY FOR SACRIFICE!!!  
$C: I accept my fate. Everything for the balance

Thanos... may have done one or two incorrect things
$C: Noooo
$C: Do it.
$C: My body is ready.
$C: My body is ready
$C: Let me guess, you're just going to ban the least active half of the subreddit?
$C: each day at 00:01 GMT half the sub is banned for 23:59 hours
$C: Why wont you balance us?
$C: Mr Stark, I don’t feel so go0•*..
$C: commenting so i can get axed
$C: Hire me I’ll ban people all night for free 
$C: Or we write something that bans half the sub whenever you need it to
$C: What a beautiful tactic to get 60k upvotes. 😂

$C: DEW IT
$C: Can’t wait.  
$C: It’s at it.
$C: It's over 60k we need to down vote to make it back to 60k
$C: And we did it. Ready 4 cleansing.

$C: And a hundred percent reason to remember the name.
$C: Do it pussy!!
$C: Reddit history in the making
$C: We are over 60k. When will the mad Titan snap his finger? Who will be left alive?
$C: I came to see if I will survive the snappening.
$C: It's been a pleasure, perhaps
$C: Is it going to be random? And why font you wait b4 the movie comes out?

Or why dont mark those who didnt make it instead of a band
$C: Rip
$C: Hey I commented once, plz don't kill me argggh
$C: I subbed just to be a part of this but then realized I’m just throwing off the balance.
$C: Subbing just to be apart of history when I get banned
$C: It has come 
$C: Thanos didn't ask
$C: Subbed just to see if I get banned. 
$C: I DO NOT FEAR THE SNAP, FOR IT IS NECESSARY FOR BALANCE! 
$C: I sacrifice I am willing to make
$C: Who is Thanos? Sick of hearing about this guy. 
$C: it has already reached half of way..
$C: Just ban everyone that upvotes this post... 
$C: I'm ready to go
$C: Black Mirror this thing and ban only those that upvoted you.
$C: Commenting to discover my destiny.
$C: Let's go
$C: The hardest decisions require the strongest upvotes
$C: Perhaps
$C: #DO IT YOU COWARDS
$C: I can't believe we're seriously doing this. I haven't even seen Infinity War and I'm caught up in the excitement.
$C: I said a snap, snap, snapity snap
$C: Do it, the hardest chooses require the strongest wills
$C: Of course. You must protect this subreddit's new utopia. What's one more body amongst the foundations? Well, what are you waiting for? Do it.     

DO IT!!!     

Wait... wrong movie.
$C: Make another separate sub so the other half can post there.
$C: Reddit..... Reddit..... I dont feel so good
$C: Well.. 68K...
$C: I subbed just to see if I survive. 
$C: Do it 
$C: Subbed. 

Lets gamble, Super-Prince. 
$C: I just subbed to this sub just to see if I get banned. Weird; almost as weird as my last sentence. 
$C: Erase me please 
$C: How will I know if I don't feel good? Will I get a notification?
$C: Oh boy this is gonna be wild
$C: I am here to be judged. Banned or not, as fate wills.
$C: 50/50, I like those odds!
$C: Good journey.
$C: What did it cost
$C: Everything 
$C: Why 60,000 is balanced not 500,000
$C: delete me daddy
$C: RoWOW
$C: DO IT YOU COWARDS. JUST DO IT.
$C: Ban me
$C: Commenting so you have my name
$C: This is beautiful
$C: I don’t wanna go
$C: oh boy
$C: Axe me.
$C: ban me I dare u
$C: They are going to ban every person who voted.  60k upvotes to ban half of 134k people. 

Oh....  Maybe their going to ban everyone who didn't vote. Better downvote just to be safe.
$C: 70k! Let's do it! I'm ready to serve my subreddit!
$C: I can't wait to get double karma
$C: *snap*
$C: My God I hope that this happens. I dont even care if I'm one of the half banned. I just want to be a part of this. 
$C: Hey doc I ain't feeling so well.
$C: Am I banned?
$C: This is like an internet suicide cult 
$C: Sounds like a win win situation to me.
$C: Ez
$C: Why don't you just ban everyone? Then everyone will think they were in the 50% and no one would be the wiser.
$C: Glory be to the Master!
$C: Bring us to the soul stone, all shiny and gold!
$C: DO IT
$C: If you go through with this u/The-Jedi-Apprentice, you have my respect.

To all those who get snapped, I hope they remember you.
$C: I'm still feeling good, where's the balance at
$C: You need to do it.
$C: Remember in the post credit scene when nick fury gets out of the car and the guy in the gray shirt in the far left, out of focus about 40 feet away disappears ...that will be me in this sub 
$C: Can’t wait until all of you are gone. ✌🏻 
$C: It's like russian roulette but less fun couse nobody dies
$C: I subbed just for the chance to get banned.
$C: I'm ready. 
$C: I'm a part of history oh boy 
$C: I subed JUST to be a part of this. make it happen
$C: Mr stark...
$C: Im ready. This sub mist be balanced. My only regret is thst this could not happen sooner
$C: Over half the sub, gotta do it now
$C: i'm subscribing to this place just to see if i get banned
$C: Ban me please
$C: Let the better half live
$C: This post really blew up.
$C: I’m just here to disappear, should balance require it
$C: All hail thanos
$C: We did it reddit!
$C: Thanos didnt ask for permissions
$C: Let it rip
$C: Upvoted and subbed. Time to test my luck. 
$C: Add me to the ban list!!! 
$C: Looking totally I’m not feeling well Mr Stark’d
$C: It’ll probably be more fun to get banned rather than to survive
$C: It's the right thing to do
$C: I want to be apart of this. 
$C: What is going on
$C: This is the coolest idea ever.
$C: I don't feel so good
$C: Why didnt Thanos just make half the universe sterile?
$C: almost forgot to subscribe
$C: OUR LORD THANOS HAS CHOSEN US
$C: LETS GO BABY
$C: now its here..or should I say... /u/The-Jedi-Apprentice is
$C: Adding a comment in hopes that I can be a part of this sub in time to see what happens
$C: I subscribed just to know my fate. It’s the closest I’ll ever get. I’m a simple man. 
$C: Can't wait
$C: Give every one a number 1 or 2 then roll a dice to decide who will be banned 
$C: Do it
$C: The end is near.
$C: It's a trick, they'll just ban the 60k people who upvoted
$C: Roll of the dice baby let’s see if Im left 
$C: do it

$C: No resurrections this time.
$C: I subscribed just for the opportunity to survive or feel the wrath of being banned from a sub for the first time
$C: Whatever u do man. I am ready it's hard but for the bright future i am ready to sacrifice myself but plzz leave Tony stark. 
$C: I’ma still look at this page even tho i wont be able to upload on it if im banned ;_;
$C: I don't feel so good...
$C: Hey look I'm subscribed
$C: Do you have to ban? Isn't it possible to to just give everyone flair that either half says "dust" and the other half "alive", regardless of if you are poor, rich, old or young.
$C: I dont feel so good...
$C: Balance
$C: I...I don’t feel so good.
$C: I’m excited
$C: Subbed. Now we'll see if I make the cut
$C: Jokes aside, offer a way to unban people, or else you'll kill the sub
$C: r/thanosdidnothingwrongisdoingsomethingwrong
$C: My body is ready
$C: lets fuckin goooooo
$C: ban me pussy
$C: Ban me :)
$C: I can't wait to be apart of Reddit history!
$C: Do it, we are ready.
$C: Balance
$C: I subbed, just to be sacrificed. 
Hail Thanos... or whatever it is we do here.
$C: Do it
$C: Just me to be included
$C: LeBron moved to the Lakers and my car broke down THANOS HURRY THE FUCK UP!!!
$C: Somethings happening!
$C: Hey you stole my idea lol

Proof : https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8h30ln/at_a_random_point_half_of_everyone_here_should_be/?st=JJ3PORSG&sh=43fbcc07
$C: I’m dreading and running! 
$C: So what happens when people start subbing to this subreddit again? The the subscriber to banned subscriber balance will be off again.
$C: Guess it's happening
$C: Hmmm
$C: commenting so i can get picked up by the bot
$C: Commenting to allow myself to be banned if it comes to it. I must give myself the chance to be perfectly balanced.
$C: DO IT
$C: Will the ban be fair and balanced?
$C: I've come out of the shadows to witness this blessed day. Do not disappoint. 
$C: I'm willing to sacrifice myself. Do you have what it takes, mods?
$C: Oh, this will be fun
$C: ayy that's a spicy meat-a-ball
$C: Do it.
$C: Bot! Beep beep! I'm all about top posts!

$C: I would like to be eligible to be banned.
$C: I don't feel so good
$C: Holy shit 110,000 upvotes in 5 hours wtf 😂
$C: What the shit just happened the sub gained 40000 subs 
$C: How is it decided who stays?
$C: 5 hours in, 100k upvotes. Where’s the balance?
$C: This has got to be one of the most upvoted posts in history by now
$C: Do it. Don't ignore your destiny .
$C: Comment 
$C: ban me daddy 😋💦
$C: Someone hold me.
$C: finally they will take my sacrifice, let me be choosen!
$C: You can’t ban me I went into the inter web and it said I was spared  by taynose 
$C: Let's do this thing
$C: Subbed just to see if I'll survive. 
$C: 100k upvotes already. Perhaps it’s time to bring balance to Reddit as a whole
$C: ban me
$C: We past 100k in less then 8 hours this has to be a record! Let the snap begin!
$C: This might be my last comment for the sub. So I suppose I have to write it now.

Did you do it? 
$C: Start the bloody banning before I piss myself!
$C: Ooh exciting!
$C: Mr. Apprentice I don't feel so good
$C: Do it!
$C: The great honour, the privilege of become a child of Thanos. *turns to dust* 


$C: Commenting for inclusion in the great balancing 
$C: Do it
$C: The sub that killed itself
$C: Just know I loved you all...
$C: When you subscribe just to hopefully get banned 
$C: I just realized that if I get banned I will have never commented on the sub, as I've joined a few weeks ago and was just a lurker. So here is the proof that I was here before being banned. I want to become a child of Thanos. 
$C: Where is the justice for our already called heroes
$C: This is history in the making 
$C: I’ve been lurking for awhile now, and figured I should post atleast once before I’m banned for the most holy of reasons: balance.  

Godspeed. 
$C: Just subscribed so I may judged fairly by such a merciful hero.
$C: You won't ban me 
$C: Axe me i want to be a child of thanos

$C: ban me senpai
$C: Karma needs to be at 60k, not 111k. Some of you need to down vote. 
$C: Shred it... marinate it...
$C: Destiny arrives all the same.
$C: Ah, I see. 
$C: Dew it!
$C: I'm so confused on what's going on, but I'm just glad to be part of it. 
$C: I thought we decided like five fucking times already 
$C: This is becoming my favorite subreddit. Show me mercy and ban me pls. 
$C: Too many upvotes! We must work to get it back to 60k!
$C: I'm ready.
$C: Make it so
$C: We’ve failed the Lord. We went over half and are now unbalanced. Unlike all things should be.
$C: I don't wont to miss out
$C: Commenting to be part of the balance
$C: ...mr stark
$C: Makes you wonder who’s gonna survive this 
$C: I hope I will survive this destruction...
$C: Just end it, atleast 50 % of uss..
$C: ??? 
$C: I volunteer as tribute.
$C: I wanna die 
$C: But not it's over 112K, we're never going to have true order at this rate
$C: But what did it cost?
$C: Just joined for the cause
$C: posting so I am properly judged
$C: Its too late for the mods to back down now. DO IT!
$C: I wanna die!!! 
$C:  do it ye fuckin pussies 
$C: DO IT!
$C: Well...if they use a bot I'm fucked name wise.
$C: Hype is real
$C: The sub has spoken, and we want balance!
$C: I haven’t even seen the movie yet, but this is legendary. Subbing just for the ban. 
$C: I’ll remember you guys
$C: After the balancing, can we get a stickied obituary post with all the names of the users who were banned (if that can be done without a ton of manual labor anyway). 
$C: Oof
$C: Hey, instead of banning half of the sub why don’t you just multiply the amount of resources to go around?
$C: The great purge
$C: /u/spez pls
$C: Aren't we like 100k subs a week ago? When did we reach 150k
$C: Finally some balance
$C: Now they ban all the people who upvoted!
$C: Snap me daddy
$C: So this made it to r/all 
$C: Mother F-
$C: I desire banning.
$C: Hello there!
$C: 10/10
$C: Nice

$C: Almost every subscribed user has upvoted this post, we are making history!
$C: I dread it.

$C: DO IT!!
$C: Commenting so I could get banned
$C: AXE ME
$C: I am ready to sacrifice myself for our lord and saviour Thanos!
$C: dust me thanos
$C: Do it!
$C: All I want is to feel balance. Please bring it upon this sub
$C: Do it
$C: I just want balance.
$C: I want to be part of this. Getting banned will be worth it, if it serves a greater good.
$C: Generic comment #3
$C: If he wills it 
$C: Well this backfired. Even a question about balance became overcrowded.
$C: If I'm spared I will be very sad. 
$C: Ban a mod, and messaged them “I’m sorry little one” 
$C: Mods better go through
$C: Shoot me in the face already 
$C: You must do this for our Lord and savior, Thanos.

For balance.
$C: Im ready for this cause
$C: Do it.
$C: Am I alive?
$C: This isn’t a dream, it’s a fuckin’ nightmare! We are ready to be banned! 
$C: Just trying to get one comment in on this sub before the purge ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
$C: Later nerds. 
$C: Perfectly balanced as all things should be
$C: [deleted]
$C: You’re full of tricks u/The-Jedi-Apprenticeship but you never used your greatest weapon...
$C: When your commenting just to have the possibility of getting banned, haha. 
$C: omg just do it already the entire sub has been begging for it for days why are you still pretending not to be sure 
$C: Commenting so I can be included in the ban
$C: u wont
$C: Let's do this
$C: Commenting to be a part of this. 
$C: ban me
$C: Commenting so I can get axed. It’s time for balance.
$C: I admire your stupidity and dedication
$C: After this, the mods can finally rest, and watch the sunrise on an ungrateful universe.
$C: This should be at 50% liked
$C: Balance is everything
$C: 
I hope I don't feel so good soon
$C: I dont feel so good mr mod
$C: I'm definitely gonna make it to the post-ban utopia.
$C: I'm scared of dying
$C: Bois I’m not feeling so good 
$C: This is now the most up voted post on reddit for the past 24 hours.
Thanos is surely proud of all of us.
$C: Bring the pain
$C: Finally as it should have been all along 
$C: I'm leaving my mark here. I hope they remember me! 
$C: comment just for the ban \o/
$C: unsub and sub back after ban
$C: I don’t wanna be beaned 
$C: Hear me, and rejoice. You are about to die at the hand of the children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributed to the balance…
$C: I had a dream a few days ago where this type of thing happened. Absolutely terrified me. Ended up surviving but damn was it stressful. Here hoping my luck continues.
$C: Get to banning already
$C: Commenting for the ban
$C: subbed just to get banned
$C: Ban me bb
$C: ban me daddy
$C: Oooooohhhh dis gon b goooood
$C: 118k upvotes so I downvoted

Am I doing this right?
$C: Here you go mods. No more tricks
$C: commenting so i can get booted.
$C: This is really breaking the fourth wall
$C: God I hope I’m not banished
$C: Imma comment just to see if it will work
$C: Mods ban yourselves 
$C: The sub must be balanced 
$C: Something is happening....
$C: yes
$C: We will be remembered. 
$C: God bless Thanos, and the sanctity he brings.
$C: As is balanced
$C: I do want it
$C: This amount of upvotes shouldn't even be possible
$C: Assuming that the mods do some deep scraping of posts and collate unique users who have commented (using API magic), this comment is to ensure that my lurking does not protect me from being weighed, measured, and balanced.
$C: The wholeass subreddit wants it, just do it already
$C: Hear me and rejoice. You are about to die at the hands of the children of u/The-Jedi-Apprentice 
$C: REJOICE
$C: didthanoskill.me 

Check if you will be killed or spared
$C: This got a ridiculous amount of upvotes
$C: WHY
$C: I subbed and now await my fate. 
$C: Just upvoted this post to 120,000 and it's just as satisfying as you think it is.
$C: Well, it's over 120K.. so that means it is STILL over your goal of 60K if half of us weren't here. 
$C: subscribed. My dick is ready
$C: I volunteer as tribute
$C: Oh nO
$C: Mods... I don't feel so good...
$C: You can't choose people randomly, whatever method you'll use, the outcome will be the same.

The lucky ones survive, the unlucky ones perish.
$C: 50k subs gained since this shenaningan started. Wait for 200k.!?
$C: Well then
$C: I like you
$C: Perfectly balanced...
$C: wow... we got to twice the upvote goal. thats almost literally the entire sub
$C: Do it 
$C: I love how almost every member of the sub upvoted this.

I think if Thanos saw how much support he gets from here, he'd be proud.
$C: Mothuh f...
$C: When 100% of the sub gives you upvotes...
$C: feeling not so great boys but excited 
$C: Just commenting here so if we go the 'ban all commenters on the sub' route I'll be able to be snapped if the universe desires it.
$C: Do it!
$C: This sub is blowing up because of this post lol
$C: We are reaching 150 k. We must ban 75k instead for balance.

$C: Nerts 
$C: That's a subscribe from me dog
$C: Only commenting to make my name more visible, thus making it fair. 
$C: This will be interesting
$C: Did you do it?
$C: Please ban me
$C: Dust in the wind
$C: I don't feel so good
$C: Here we go boys!
$C: Die me!!
$C: *I don't feel so good*
$C: I'm just here to see what happens
$C: Yes
$C: I’m here to challenge fate, ban me if you can
$C: Than make ban least until the A4 and reverse of the Snap
$C: My body is ready
$C: I don’t feel so good.

$C: Everyone betray me
$C: Nike... just do it!
$C: Ban me
$C: Mr. Mods. I don't feel so good.
$C: Is there no more of votes than there are people subscribed?
$C: The gods smile down on me, can you say the same?
$C: AND ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST
$C: I hope I'm remembered
$C: Ah what a day to be alive 
$C: 124K upvotes.. you've gotten twice what you've asked for. Now give us the balance we want.
$C: Commenting so I can get banned :)

$C: Needs to be random and Mods can't be excluded in the snappening!
$C: Do it!
$C: This is no place to die. 
$C: Remember me. 
$C: Do it. 
$C: It's not about what we want... It's about what we need... Balance...
$C: Destiny awaits.
$C: We're in the end-game now. There was no other way.
$C: Unbalanced, like all things should be
$C: Remember me, fellow redditors.
$C: Try it. I could do this all day.
$C: DOOOOO EEEEETT
$C: This is great
$C: I’m subbing again just to see if it hits me 
$C: Can anyone ELI5 me what all this is about?

Ban half the population?

Is the mod Trump?  <---  bad joke.

Seriously, what is this about?

$C: When all the quotes have been taken
$C: Double the subs resources instead?

Also this will practically show the issue of populations quickly rebounding, those 60k will be back in the form of new subs quickly. 
$C: I'm commenting in hopes of getting obliterated.
$C: Get on it Squidward! 
$C: Damn got 20,000 subs in 1 day. The population is already growing uncontrollably fast. We need the snap. 
$C: Nothing to see here. Just commenting so I have a chance to get banned. I mean me too thanks

$C: Commenting to get axed

$C: Did it happen yet?
$C: Hello there
$C: Subscribed for the event. 
$C: DO IT!!!!
$C: Did it work?
$C: Hear me and rejoice! You have had the privilege of being saved by the great Thanos. You may think this is suffering, no, it is salvation. The universal scale tips towards balance because of your sacrifice. Smile. For even in being banned, you have become children of Thanos
$C: Me too!
$C: If I have to comment to be in the ban pool. Then my lurking days are done. May thanos will be done, to avoid becoming Titan. Give us our daily snap and may we never forget the ones who will be lost, for they are with Thanos now.
$C: i'm waiting

$C: I just want to die
$C: Perfectly balanced, as all things should be. 
$C: I feel sad for all the late subs and uppvotes who just want in on meme history leading to half the original subs getting banned due to being outnumbered in the votes, but here i am, subbing today and uppvoting this
$C: Fear not for even in death you will become children of thanos. 
$C: I’d like to stay afterwards so may luck be ever in my favor.

$C: We're in the endgame.
$C: Let’s do this
$C: Just subscribed in hopes of getting banned, let's go

$C: Great the ppl from all got it over 60k :/
$C: Remember my name!!
$C: Don't handwave away my incoming ban. My ban is for the good of the rest of y'all.
$C: We need to establish another sub for the banned people to go on... right niw i think its r/inthesoulstone but alot of people are saying other subs, so we need an official place
$C: Can't wait to see who survives the snap.
$C: My big day

$C: Just commenting to get banned. Praise Thanos! 
$C: FOR BALANCE
$C: Ban me
$C: Subbed just to see if I *do* or *don't* feel so good.
$C: It isn't a matter of wanting or not wanting it, it is simply a matter of balance. This must happen.
$C: I volunteer to be turned to dust
$C: 150K/2 =/= 60K
$C:     I don't feel great 

$C: Brace yourselves, balance is coming. 
$C: We're way way beyond 60 K now.
$C: I can't tell if I want to be banned or not be banned. But I want to be part of Reddit history. 
$C: Ban me senpai
$C: I want to get axed! Way over half the sun has upvoted!
$C: Yes but how will the users be decided? Can we trust the mods to do it at random?
$C: Pee is stored in the balls
$C: I’m in it
$C: How long will this take

$C: Yeet
$C: Liesssss
$C: Commenting so I can participate.

er, is it too late to be considered? I'm not normally a last minute bandwagon jumper - but it seems I don't comment enough (or perhaps angrily enough?) to get banned, so it would be a 6 year first for me... I did once think of just calling the mods in /r/the_donald a bunch of cunts, but couldn't bring myself to subscribe in the first place...
$C: The time is almost here...
$C: I'm here
$C: Wack
$C: @ /u/hannahmayz9
$C: ban me

$C: Nice
$C: Goodbye reddit
$C:    .
$C: Yeah!
$C: Yeet
$C: "so, like, Thor... I totally get it, and like I know you have an axe in my chest, but like, do you think I should snap or not? I mean, I still kinda feel like it's a big deal. It's a good idea... Right?"
$C: Woah
$C: I feel fine
$C: Fuck oath.

$C: And so it begins
$C: This is absolutely amazing.
$C: hi
$C: Привет ♥️
$C: Holy shit, we will almost hit around 100K upvotes! Did it went to r/all or is our sub just that crazy? 
$C: Here's how to do it: Open a new sub, only let 60k subscribers in, then make it private, then delete this sub. Make the new sub public again in a week from now. Done.
$C: Should really wait until just before A4 to do it, though. 
$C: 51k in 2 hours. Let's get this to the top of all time reddit for even more balance
$C: Just make 2 subs, ban half the people on here and whoever doesn't get banned on this one gets banned on the second one. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Anyone else totally over Reddit becoming an Avengers circle jerk?  
$C: How about ban the whole sub

$C: Only those not in perfect balance are targeted
$C: Banned
$C: Again? I don't know if my heart can take another snapping
$C: Commenting so I don't miss out on a potential badge
$C: .
$C: u/The-Jedi-Apprentice give me mod and I’ll do it by hand. Completely random.
$C: I dont feel so good about this
$C: He's probably just gonna ban everyone that liked this aka the post, not this comment, please don't vote on me, I want to be balanced on 0
$C: "Hey guys I'm the mod of a popular subreddit, give me karma plz"
$C: This sub has really gone to shit. It's just everyone shitting on the mods about not wanting to lose half their subscriber base. 100 thousand is not only an even number but not close to overpopulated. If the half that gets banned is the terrible shitposters I'll be so happy. There has been not a single other meme recently than BAN HALF THE SUB HAHA BALANCE OOH. 
$C: Who the fuck is thanos and why has half of reddit been plastering him for karma
$C: The entire MCU is a steaming turd.
$C: What?

$C: BRING BALANCE 
$C: Maybe not outright ban?
$C: dont ban me
$C: Yeet
$C: There's something freeing about this whole thing
$C: [deleted]
$C: Commenting just so I’m on the list
$C: I never heard of this subreddit but maybe you guys can help me understand something, if the infinity gauntlet gives thanos to manipulate reality create and destroy why didnt he just make enough resources to provide for an expanding universe rather than destroy half of its population? 
$C: This is great. I like this
$C: Instead of banning half the sub just make it where you have a 50/50 chance when you attempt to subscribe to the subreddit. Some people approved others denied to maintain balance. That way nobody has to get banned so people who enjoy can still subscribe. People can just reattempt to subscribe if they are denied and it gives them a 50/50 chance every time.
$C: I want to go
$C: Holy shit, I think this is the fast upvotes post ever.

Thanos would be proud. 
$C: You wouldn't dare you pussy ass bitch.
$C: Won't this ultimately lead to a stale sub?  And how long until users randomly again decided it's "unbalanced" and demand another culling.

Here's what's going to happen.  Those who "survive" will meme it up for a month until there's no more karma from that.  Then new content will be slow.  People will unsubscribe.  And it'll be too late to realize this "unbalanced" joke was terrible.

Ah yes, the downvotes.  Everyone is on-board this "joke" but an opposing opinion, one that balances out the zealotry is buried.  What disciples of Thanos....

$C: What a beautiful sacrifice
$C: Ye Boi farming that Karma
$C: Do you think fetuses were also turned to ash in the snap?
$C: Haha suckers I’m not even subscribed and I’m deciding your fate. Like the Living Tribunal or something.
$C: the score is hidden. i see through the jedi lies

$C: "Hear me and rejoice! You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan. You may think this is suffering. No... it is salvation. 

The universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile... for even in banning, you have become children of Thanos."
$C: Y'all
$C: What will it cost you? 
$C: Hi, lurker here. I just to want to leave something behind to be remembered by in case I’m chosen to sacrifice.
$C: They will when all those users are un-banned next year after the release of Avengers 4!
$C: I’m sorry little one. 
$C: I wiiiill, remember yooou
$C: I'm so excited.
$C: My ancestors are smiling at me, Imperials. Can yours say the same?
$C: Godspeed
$C: Dead people don’t have memories
$C: Doing this to test my luck
$C: We are going to make reddit history by doing this. 
$C: I don't
$C: Obligatory “I don’t feel so good..” 
$C: Hi there, I haven't seen infinity war yet, but I've subscribed to this sub anyway just so I can maybe get banned if that happens. 
$C: You have my respects Reddit.
$C: I don't feel so good....
$C: And though you’re banned and gone, believe me your memory will carryyyyyyy onnnnnnnnn. 
$C: Just commenting so i’m not in automatic ban pool
$C: Nice
$C: Remember me please
$C: Me too. 
$C: Good fortunes. 
$C: Bye. 
$C: A surprise, to be sure
$C: Yep
$C: I love /r/thanosdidnothingwrong 
$C: Hello there.
$C: Good...
$C: Dew it
$C: Destiny isn’t a democracy 
$C: I'm so proud of us.
$C: Vote democracy we have to beat Misty guys.
$C: I love the Republic.
$C: I love the Republic 
$C: So this is how half the subreddit dies, with thunderous GIVE BAN
$C: [deleted]
$C: Run from it...
$C: I feel like there was a missed opportunity to use Dreddit.. 
$C: Bop it
$C: here goes
$C: Just commenting to get banned 
$C: Why dread it?
$C: AND MY AXE
$C: Thanos level karmawhore.
$C: *I'm sorry, little one*
$C: The hardest choices require the strongest of wills

FTFY
$C: General misquoti!
$C: Like Will Smith? 
$C: It will cost everything
$C: First, I’m considering a few more people to become part time mods for the sole purpose of banning people. And second, I am looking into the possibility of using bots to do this 
$C: The mods should create a private subreddit and invite the banned people to it.
$C: WE WILL HAVE TWO SUBREDDITS, PERFECTLY BALANCED
$C: Commenting so I can possibly be banned. 
$C: Get up /u/thebuggawump this is no place to die
$C: Then that sub should ban everyone living in this one.
$C: Do we need to be banned here to be accepted there?
$C: I cannot wait to come
$C: But not me, balance.
$C: I’ve never been banned. I wanna see what happens!!!  Bring it on!!
$C: If you really want to get banned go to r/conservative and start talking about the southern strategy
$C: I haven't even seen the movie, but I'm coming along for the ride
$C: It would be an honor to be banned for such an honorable cause.
$C: Just go over to r/latestagecapitalism and say something nice about capitalism.
$C: Same here. Pick me!

$C: Same
$C: Go to the_donald sub and say he is a pussy. U will be banned immediately.
$C: Me Too.
Subscribing just so that I could get banned. 
$C: Me too thanks 
$C: Just go bash communism on r/latestagecapitalism

Worked for me
$C: Just go on r/The_Donald and say something moderately reasonable and watch the magic happen.
$C: Ban me daddy?
$C: Word
$C: im taking my chances.
$C: Ban me daddy Thanos
$C: Lets not be that type of banned users 
$C: Please don't hesitate to to make the right decision
$C: I wanna be banned too
$C: Hoping to get banned. I gave up being a lurker and made an account just for this
$C: Thanos would never ask for permission or opinions 

Edit: is this gonna be my highest rated comment just for stating facts?
$C: Well, I mean, thanos waited like 30 years before he went after the stones
$C: We're still at "assembling the Infinity Gauntlet" stage here, not "waiting to snap".
$C: https://media.giphy.com/media/NlR0RF1v972Mw/source.gif
$C: Little harder in the real world than just snapping your fingers
$C: Snapdiddlydoodly
$C: He’s so indecisive I actually thought there was a “haha” at the end of his title.
$C: If Thanos was on DBZ. 
“Just you wait! Half of you are going to disappear!!”
$C: Okily dokily
$C: Exactly, Thanos didn’t ask the entire universe if they wanted half of them to be killed. He just did it.
$C: Stupid sexy Thanos.
$C: Real talk, I think it's pretty clear that this is what the subreddit wanted, and this post was just an easy way to whore out some karma. "Gimmie 60,000 upvotes first, just so I know you're serious or whatever."
$C: Turning half of you into nothing at all

Nothing at all...

Nothing at all...
$C: Wait....
$C: He doesn't have a gauntlet, be nice
$C: I gotta get all the stonerinos
$C: They need to karma whore first apparently
$C: Ned was left handed.
$C: Seriously! Wasting so much of our Finite Resources!

Coward! Snap already!
$C: Omg. Perfect :)
$C: Snap diddly ap!
$C: Ban me
$C: Howdy-ho Avengerinos!
$C: As all things should didaly de.
$C: I know
$C: Maybe they’re just gonna ban the first 60K people to upvote the post
$C: He must collect the power of the stones first
$C: Well heydilo ho Eartherinos! Ya don't mind if I snapped my fingers and killed half of you, do ya?
$C: What are you going to do? Ban me?
$C: For real
$C: Do it.
$C: Should’ve gone for the go ahead......
$C: [deleted]
$C: When you're saving the universe, you don't get to consider whether the universe wants to be saved or not
$C: Thanos did a lot of wotk before he was able to do it and needed the infinity stones.. he will need the tools too
$C: Thanos asked the people of Titan, and was rejected. We must make the necessary sacrifices now, before this subreddit ends like the glorious land of Titan
$C: Let him have his fun
$C: Polls kinda *are* balance...from a certain point of view. 
$C: “ Math is math! Why would they ever change math!”
$C: On his home planet he kind of did.
$C: this day extracts a heavy toll
$C: Yeah. It kinda feels like the mods here don’t understand Thanos at all.
$C: 60k upvotes is the mind stone.
$C: The “poll” was taken the moment we were born into this overpopulated universe.
$C: The mods should just do it with or without the support of the subreddit
$C: We need the polls to collect the power of the stones 
$C: He did an internal poll on how he could best eradicate half the population. This is just the mods slowly realising that they need to find the infinity bot
$C: Smile or no smile... rich or poor... balance reaches all
$C: Hope they remember that smile on your face 
$C: 2.5k as i make this comment
$C: [deleted]
$C: It's 109K as of 11:36 PM, July 1
$C: 130K holy shit

$C: 100k as I make this comment. 
$C: 104,000 currently. 
$C: Can’t wait till it’s not.
$C: And that means the balance is off and must be... Corrected.
$C: It can't last, there simply isn't enough meme material to support a population this large. 
$C: True

$C: It must be fair, random, dispassionate, rich and poor alike.
$C: Exactly
$C: I'm commenting here so I can be on the list one way or the other.
$C: How do you ban the lurkers? 
$C: I am commenting to remove my lurker status. I suggest other lurkers try to do the same.
$C: Commenting so Thanos can pass judgement on me.
$C: Oh, didn't realize it would only be people posting comments etc.

Consider this my entry for the ban.
$C: This subreddit is finite. Its karma, finite. If new subs are left unchecked, OC will cease to exist. It needs correction. 
$C: Agree
$C: random or nothing
$C: I volunteer as tribute (to be banned)!
$C: Commenting to be on the list too lol
$C: Commenting so I'm on the list
$C: It has to be everybody! Otherwise lurkers would replace and it would start all over. 
$C: As a lurker, I would be remiss if I wasn't on said list. 
$C: Unfortunately subscriptions are private data, there is no way for the mods/bot to know who is subbed, so comments are the only realistic method. Even banning is going to be lackluster because a van doesn't unsub you. So all the numbers will stay the same.  Honestly I think the fair idea is best because its the only one that will have a visible effect.
$C: I Didn’t think about that. Rip future thanos memes
$C: Commenting just in case subbing isn't enough to get banned. 
$C: Me too thanks
$C: Add me to the bandwagon
$C: Dread it.
$C: I don't know what I expected clicking that subreddit.
$C: People dont swem to get that they cant "just do it" they literally don't have to means to instantly ban 60k users. Its going to take time
$C: Rich and poor alike...random and indiscriminate...that’s how true balance is brought
$C: What would happen if every mod was banned? 
$C: Did Thanos give himself a 50% chance of dying?
$C: Well, fuck, you're right
$C: at least your life isn't turning into dus.

$C: Yes officer this comment 
$C: I don't feel so good...
$C: I don't feel so balanced
$C: lol same
$C: Same. Plz ban me
$C: Same here.
$C: Pretty sure that’s why the sub gained 50k subscribers so quickly, people like you and me. Take me, Thanos.
$C: Also
$C: Same
$C: Same
$C: Same
$C: Same
$C: Same plz ban
$C: I don't understand what this means, but I agree wholeheartedly
$C: Snap me boys 
$C: It's all a ploy to get upvotes for the mods
$C: What a day, what a lovely day!
$C: and as always, *Destiny arrives all the same. And now, it's here. Or should I say, I am."*
$C: There *was* a way. This died when the Reddit API for it died. (Although this is kind of a solved problem IMHO).
$C: The only problem I see with that plan is it leaves out all the people that don’t comment/post, so you probably wouldn’t end up banning half of the sub, just half of the active people.

There’s have to be a way to get a list of all the users subscribed I would think, but I don’t know if that data is available.

$C: Same
$C: It is a tale as old as the time stone.

A sub named "r/thanosdidnothingwrong" was created, honouring the great Thanos.

It was full with great, ripe thanos memes

However, soon the sub reached over 100,000 subs, and the subreddit became unbalanced.

The amount of original memes went down in numbers as there were most posters than ever before.

To restore balance, the subreddit is divided on whether half of the Subreddit should be banned.

I wish you luck.....

$C: Eh, *downvotes*
$C: Yah half the universe didn't vote, don't need half the sub. 
$C: People will be able to subscribe, however due to the decreased sub count, the rate of new subscribers will be much slower. 
$C: Statistically, one of us won't make it. Perfectly balanced. As all things should be.

$C: Agreed
$C: They should also make a second sub for the people who are banned to go to called “Thanos’s Soul World”. Basically, it’ll be the same thing as the first one but ban those who live from joining. You can’t be in both at the same time. 
$C: you can't get a list, for privacy issues. 
$C: They all want to become children of Thanos
$C: I witness you, broth-
$C: subbing has absolutely nothing to do with banning. 
$C: After all
$C: they specifically set a goal which wouldn't be met. [Ain't no way they're banning half the people who participate in this sub.](https://imgflip.com/s/meme/I-Guarantee-It.jpg) 

EDIT: oh shit we at almost 50k now. Maybe I'm wrong, we were at like 25k when I commented

$C: there's not enough resources to go around. Too much karma is being used up. You and 60k others will be erased from this subreddit to restore balance to this universe. 

I'm sorry, my **Pickel** one
$C: Lets chop this user In half.. he is unbalanced.  
$C: That's what he said 
$C: If we're a part of all things then yes
$C: The universe would learn nothing, and the Gauntlet would need to be kept in use. It almost melted from his snap. I imagine creating unlimited resources and planets is far more complicated and taxing on the gauntlet.
$C: I feel good
$C: 😂
$C: I hope they **DONT** remember you
$C: What did it cost?
$C: The hardest choices require the strongest wills. 
$C: Stickied comments don't gain or lose karma for the person posting.
$C: I hope I’m in the screenshot 
$C: **I call it, mercy..**
$C: Sticky comments don’t lose or gain karma. It’s a bamboozle
$C: The max you can actually be affected by a comment is -100
$C: Downvotes are actually capped at 100 so he loses virtually nothing in comparison.
$C: Wouldn’t perfectly balanced mean upvoting two separate posters to 60k instead of one poster to 120k?

Edit: oh shit I didn’t see the negative sign, my b. 
$C: It's really happening!
$C: Anyone know a way to see how many downvotes it gets?
$C: As all things should be
$C: Spare me Thanos
$C: Also downvotes don't seem to matter much to an account, at least according to the EA fiasco a few months back[.](https://imgur.com/cXA7XxW)

$C: Word. I haven't even seen the movie (was it good?)  but it sounds cool to join, just to see if i get banned. kinda like a lotto

$C: I say this only counts as truly balanced if admins are on the list for random bans too
$C: I’m subscribing now, not just to be a part of this, but because after I saw the movie I also knew Thanos was right. Thanos 2020!!!
$C: I bet r/offmychest's shadowban list is longer than this.
$C: It's great to hear that the mods are trying to follow through with the idea. Instead of doing what's safe, do what's bold. In ten years, no one will remember how quietly and reasonably you modded some subreddit, but they *might* remember how you banned over 60k people, and the immense firestorm it caused.
$C: I hope they remember you.
$C: Thanos will be proud.
$C: I hope they remember us.
$C: and who doesn’t want to be a part of history! BAN ME ALREADY
$C: Nah, r the donold has banned well over 70k
$C: I want to be a part of history! 
$C: I want to be a part of Reddit history. Add my name to the balance!
$C: I'm down for that
$C: Same
$C: Likewise 
$C: I heard you had to comment to get axed or something so here I am. I call this mercy.
$C: Word
$C: Ban me like one of your French girls.
$C: Delete me Daddy Thanos. 
$C: Ban me hard, daddy.
$C: Rip
$C: This is gonna be so much fun!
$C: Don’t let your life pass you by.
$C: It's funny to imagine that you've never not been unable to recollect memories of the future in which you haven't stopped the continuation of having had to have had dreamlike realities with scenarios similar of which to there are no resemblances of me. It is in times like this that I've beckoned to recall that I'll just start with you at the end of my run and hope somebody pushes play.
$C: You ‘member? I ‘member. 
$C: Remember me for I have to say goodbye~
$C: It was the only way. 
$C: Will they tell your story?
$C: You only live as long as the last person to remember you
$C: Not really

$C: Not even here is safe
$C: Yep
$C: Yep yep
$C: Dad?
$C: Mhmm
$C: You're a bold one 
$C: Destiny still arrives
$C: Bop it...
$C: The bans still arrive 
$C: Bop it...
$C: DENNAB
$C: Ban from it...
$C: *proceeds to beat meat*
$C: Lol noone ever gets it right
$C: We will need bots, banning 60,000 people manually will take so long, by the time we're done there will be another 60,000. Thanos didn't kill off people one by one
$C: >First, I’m considering a few more people to become part time mods for the sole purpose of banning people

Would take ages to ban everyone.

A bot would be super simple to make to ban people.

Bots can make 60 requests a minute to the Reddit API. Meaning we can ban 60 users a minute. (Just to be safe personally I would go with 55 bans a minute)

The hardest part is getting a list of users to ban. u/avd9271 had a few comments about this in another thread.

Not sure what he ended up doing but I think the best way would be to go through all the posts and comments in this subreddit and get a list of every user that has contributed to the subreddit. Then ban half of that list. I think that's what r/avd9271 was saying as well.
$C: If the mod team wants to set up a discord/a chat with a few devs so we can all discuss this I'm up for helping out.
$C: Dude, all you need are the 6 Inifnity Stones and a Gauntlet
$C: I've never been a mod of a subreddit. My last experience was being an admin on ezboard at least ten years ago, but I'd serve our Lord if need be. 
$C: You have to get the admins involved.  100% they need to do this.
 
For them, it's a script.  An SQL update.  Takes 0.5 seconds, and can randomize it in any way.  If they calculate the time a person subs, ban everyone who subbed at an even millisecond.  If they don't store the time and save them in order they subbed, delete every other one.  With full access like they have this is trivial.
 
***AND*** they can set it so those people are no longer subscribed, which would actually decrease the count as well.
$C: I'd be down to be a part-time hire for the genocide. Is experience a plus or a minus here? 
$C: Hey man I've already finished a bot that can be modified to your needs https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8vdhh8/the_infinity_gauntlet_is_ready/?utm_source=reddit-android
$C: Use bots to be more fair and balanced. Mods shouldn’t be safe from banning too.

$C: Petition the admins to do it for you! It's the only way!
$C: Can an admin help out? 
$C: Bots? You mean the Infinity stones? Well yes you will need at least 6.

Name them appropriately, and set them to random. 
$C: Have you asked the Reddit admins if they have a way?
$C: Ask /u/rWoahDude he is amazing at mass bans. 
$C: I joined so you could ban me 
$C: You mean like children?
$C: Who's to say they haven't already been invite....

I don't.... I don't feel so good

# I don't want to gc:;'''
$C: ~~/r/idontfeelsogood~~

/r/idontwannago
$C: That's a good idea
$C: Still would need a list of subbers 
$C: Someone suggested that they should simply get unbanned after a month (or sooner).
$C: I love this idea
$C: A paradise beyond death,
$C: AS ALL THINGS SHOULD BE
$C: only half of me plz ty
$C: I was banned because I commented in T_D about someone being laughably hypocritical (and was banned from T_D). 

The mod in latestage just saw a comment there and banned me. No context. Nothing. Those mods are edgelords. 
$C: But like. I don’t wanna lie 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Remember how in the final fight, Thanos held back, when he could have just crushed the heroes.

The great one also knew doubt...
$C: > Thanos would never ask for permission or opinions

Except when he did, during the backstory that he explained.  He offered his plan as a suggestion and it was ignored, dooming his planet.

After that, he decided to start doing more than ask.
$C: That’s the point he was making. But congratulations for getting 700+ upvotes simply for repeating.
$C: Thanos waited for the right opportunity. He also didn't straight up ask people if they wanted it.
$C: The found them all in like six hours. He was just as lazy
$C: Seems like he could get no satisfaction
$C: Fine. I'll do it myself.
$C: Was hopping for a photoshopped Thanos Flanders. Sorta extremely disappointed. 
$C: Larry David is in pretty great shape. 
$C: "real world"
$C: Snap them two.
$C: He did have a little prep time
$C: A bit easier than gathering the infinity stones
$C: Just ban the first half of the list of subscribers.

In the set of all sets of users which get banned, there exists a set in which that first half of the list is banned. If the users that get banned are chosen randomly, then that set of users is just as likely to be banned as any other set of users.
$C: This genuinely got me to lol. Thanks!
$C: [deleted]
$C: This Thanos is basically emperor pilaf going after the dragonballs.
$C: Stupid sexy Thanos
$C: To allow the universe to balance itself, is to condemn it to death by it's own hand.
$C: But it will be fun.
$C: You didn't save my life, you ruined my death!
$C: The Jedi are weak. The Sith are weak. Only through Thanos may you find balance and salvation.
$C: My smile doesn’t feel so good...
$C: I’m on mobile that’s probably why 
$C: Holy shit that went up quick. Mine's at 6.7k. 5 minutes apart.
$C: What about now?

$C: To you, /u/Falegamble, and /u/justcuzIwannasayit... currently at 100K.

*Edit:* Adding /u/pauldapizzaman. Cuz I noticed that he wanted some too.
$C: Over 100k. It's happening, boys!
$C: 37k now, 45 minutes after your comment
$C: 111.4K as I reply to this comment
$C: Perfectly balanced
$C: 54k upvotes 40 minutes later.  This thing is going to happen!
$C: Perfectly balanced. As all cake days should be. 
$C: 102k now
$C: Happy Cake Day!
$C: Being banned would be the best cake day present.
$C: Literally keep checking my phone to see what it gets to 
$C: Woahhh we have shown that we truelly need balance ! 
$C: Ban half of all reddit users period.
$C: And Mods
$C: Lurkers and posters alike xD
$C: It must be fair, random, dispassionate, farmers and lurkers alike.
$C: The lenders could come out of hiding and prosper in the land free from an overload of content
$C: same
$C: Hello fellow lurkers 
$C: good idea

$C: same
$C: Same here
$C: as am I
$C: Same
$C: Great idea
$C: Neat
$C: Same
$C: Same
$C: Ditto.
$C: Same
$C: Same
$C: ditto
$C: That's a good idea.
$C: Ditto
$C: No idea, I'm not a reddit expert. Just thought it should be noted.
$C: You must lure them out... oh shit... now I'm on the list.... at least i will be a part of the balancing
$C: Why not just ask the Reddit admins how to do this?
$C: You'd have to make it a private sub, right? That would restrict it to subscribers only. 

Then you could ban half of them. Allow new users to join, but keep track of the newcomers. 

Then either ban half of the newcomers or ban half of the population again. 
$C: easy. 

ban 30,000 active members and ban 30,000 lurkers. 


$C: I hope they remember you 
$C: Same lol

I want to be a part of reddit history
$C: They said they have bots scraping the comments for names of users to do the ban. So I am commenting as well.
$C: Didn't think about that I'll do the same lol 
$C: Aye, me tooth aches.
$C: Me too!
$C: Me too!
$C: Run from it.
$C: What did it cost?
$C: Huh, I don't feel so good
$C: I agre...                                    

I don't.... I don't feel so go:;''
$C: That big lonely dwarf, probably!
$C: €3.50
$C: >In the beginning the Universe was created.
This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.
$C: Run from it...
$C: Are you alright?
$C: It's one of Dave Chapelle's portrayals of Rick James
$C: **TONY STARK WAS ABLE TO BUILD THIS IN A CAVE! WITH A BOX OF SCRAPS!**
$C: Well, banning people from subs only prevents them from commenting/posting anyway. There *could* be a bot that gives new commenters a 50% chance of ban after the megaban occurs to "solve" that problem.
$C: Just Incase I need to comment 
$C: do it
$C: me 2
$C: Dispassionate
$C: Lol, losers.

$C: He chooses those at *random. Dispassionate, and fair. The rich and poor alike.* 
$C: Oh shit that’s even better!  

Ban out the people! Create a new sub called “thanosdideverythingwrong” and you can only be in it if your banned from this sub!

Then unban everyone like u said when the avengers save the day and pull everyone out of “thanosdideveythingwrong”

Dude that would be awesome

$C: good bot
$C: Holy shit really?
$C: Joke
$C: This is a great ELI5, thank you!! 

so, will the 50% be selected at random? or did Thanos dislikes a particular kind of user in this sub (so to speak). Will it be like Karma based or something? Gender? Number of letters in the user_name?
$C: This is literally the 5th time ive been caught... fuck i need to remember 
$C: No let his opinions be, we need balance

$C: *Doctor Strange scream intensifies*
$C: There’s a cap before the downvotes don’t affect your total karma. It’s not a large cap either.
$C: Yeah only a certain amount of karma can be subtracted from your account per comment/post, I think 100.
$C: They don't and even if they did a comment can only cost you -10 karma, anything after -10 is just for show.
$C: It was put in place to prevent trolls fighting over who had the "best" negative karma score. Trolls are strange, sad little people.
$C: Yeah but it’s pinned by the mod so it doesn’t actually do anything to his karma

$C: I dont feel so good.
$C: Thanks for the tip. Here I am thanos! 
$C: Nice idea, here to get axed
$C: Just ban half this thread. 
$C: I wanna see if I would survive Thano's purging!
$C: So I should comment to be included. 
$C: Here for the axe. Or no axe.
$C: Me too
$C: this is my obligatory comment
$C: Hi I'm here to possibly die
$C: Same
$C: I'm commenting on your comment in hopes that I can get axed.
$C: Oh shit okay. Good thing I commented then.
$C: I will comment as well so I can get axed. 
$C: If that's the case then I guess I need to comment
$C: likewise
$C: Me too thanks. 
$C: Oh boy thanks for alerting me. I  really want to get banned. Will feel like I belong for once.
$C: Oh. Um... hi!
$C: Thanks me too
$C: Pick me pls
$C: In that case, for solidarity I am here. 
$C: Oh, well if that's the only way our great titan lord will be able to bring balance, I will comment too, and hope for balance to be brought.
$C: Looks like I need to comment, then.
$C: Haha yes
$C: Nice. 
$C: If commenting is what it takes then sign me up!
$C: >So I'm just commenting so I can get axed.

Oh shoot, me too. 
$C: So am I.
$C: I’d like a chance at axing myself as well. This seems like an easier way than splitting logs.
$C: A captain goes down with the ship.
$C: Replying just to be sure
$C: Now I will comment, to make it fair
$C: I must reply to partake 
$C: Makes sense.

$C: kill me
$C: Damn, I better start commenting
$C: Thanks for letting me know I have to comment to get axed.
$C: metoothanks
$C: same.
$C: Sorry to spam ur inbox but I wanna get balanced too
$C: They can't ban all of us. 
$C: I want to get banned. Wait, what?
$C: I want to survive
$C: Take me out, Thanos 
$C: In that case, so am I.
$C: Well if I need to comment I'll make that sacrifice
$C: Just commenting so I can get axed too then. 
$C: Same here!
$C: So I can get banned just by commenting? 
$C: axe me too thanks
$C: There must be balance.... 
$C: One ban for me please
$C: Seconded.
$C: Agreed. 



(Also commenting to make sure I'm on the list of people in the sub who can get banned)
$C: And the mods, including the ones who ban everyone?
$C: It needs to be random

$C: none are safe from thano's judgement
$C: Not really. Thanos wasn’t included. And Idk if his followers were included either
$C: But thanos probably didn't include himself and would he have included his children 
$C: Exactly, theres no point otherwise.

Imo mods should also be included in the random draw
$C: Random, dispassionate, fair to mods and users alike. 
$C: That makes sense
$C: Perfectly balanced, as things should be.
$C: That would be awesome. What if they all got banned? 
$C: Agreed 
$C: "Don't settle for the lesser evil."
$C: I'm commenting to make sure my name is on the list.
$C: I'm talkin about the largest mass ban of all time. Like other subs have banned a lot of people but have they done as many as we plan to do in as short a period of time.
$C: I hope we crash a server or something. Or I hope there's a wrench in the system that stops us for a minute and then we beat it, so we can say "Should have aimed for the head."
$C: I pray for your remeberance.
$C: All at once? We could achieve the largest mass ban of Reddit history.
$C: Measwell
$C: We must make the sacrifice.
$C: Allright
$C: Ban me like a meme in the EU.
$C: Yes!
$C: Weep not for the memories
$C: I read this in the song form. U know the sappy one by Sarah McLachlan. Idk why that font is so big too. Sry. Awkward feeling setting in



$C: I'm pretty sure that doesn't not make no sense
$C: hmm
$C: Attempting partial translation to understandable stuff:

    > It's funny to imagine that you've never been able to recollect memories of the future [visions? dreams? thoughts of the future?] without me. It is in times like this that I remember that I'll just start with you at the end of my run and hope somebody pushes play [I have no clue].

Yeah, no idea wtf it means. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Name checks out.
$C: I MEMBERS
$C: The strongest of wills requires the thickest of accents
$C: Imagine switching Thanos and Yondu’s voices
$C: The Infinity Belt Buckle
$C: Well he already looks like Stone Cold Steve Austin
$C: I... I killed them. I killed half of them all. They’re dead, every other one of them. And not just the men, but the women, and the children too!
$C: Hello there!
$C: r/expectedprequelmemes
$C: I really wish this was real



r/subsyoufellfor
$C: You underestimate our power
$C: Thanks will bring balance to the force 
$C: Not even the younglings survived. 
$C: Hello there
$C: And now it's here
$C: *snap*
$C: UNBREAK MY hhhhhEEEEAAARRRRTTTT! SAY YOU LOVE ME AGGGGAAAIN!!
$C: Twist it...
$C:     Daddy I don’t feel so good..
$C: Little one?! I'm sorry frist of all how dare you!!1
$C: 😂😂
$C: /r/jesuschristreddit
$C: They're trying and that that's the important thing
$C: Gather the Infinity Botnet
$C: I have done the bot https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8vdhh8/the_infinity_gauntlet_is_ready/?utm_source=reddit-android

I can modify it to your needs. 
$C: Even with the API it'd take forever to keep from getting banned plus you don't know who is subbed and who isn't. You could set up an automod rule to automatically remove half of all new comments, not exactly a ban but it'd still be a 50% purge of content.
$C: Can't you just ban a person at random, add 1 to x, and when x is 60,000 kill the bot?
$C: You need to collect all 6 reddit golds before you will have the power to do that.
$C: Is there like a way where you can block new people from entering the sub while you restore balance?
$C: You need the stones.
$C: Really excited about this. Is there anything I can do to help?
$C: My ancestors are smiling at me, Imperials. Can yours say the same?
$C: Just gotta implement a policy going forward that every other subscriber gets instabanned. Then you don't have to worry about it.
$C: 60000 manually? Easy breazy! 
Btw. You have been banned from r/donyang
$C: This will cost everything
$C: Wait to reach 200k subs and don’t forget half the mods must be banned
$C: Nothing a 'for' loop and rng cant do.
$C: Essentially if this actually happens, I think the sub is gonna be pretty demolished. Maybe you should just give half the subscribers mod powers and let the issue solve itself since it's gonna be in pieces anyways.
$C: The main problem is clearly getting the sub list, but I remember a Reddit admin posting in the proposal thread. Perhaps he's in for the cause and you could ask him for help
$C: Have you considered asking reddit themselves if they can just do it in one snap of their fingers?
$C: Randomly select a letter from the alphabet, ban anyone why has that letter in their name
$C: Hear hear
$C: More like 74k at this point 
$C: Late to the party, but can you just write a script to do this? Get a list of users, then do curl calsl to ban half?
$C: make half the subscribers mods and they all ban 1 person. done.
$C: Looks like you're gonna have to ban ~250,000 now
$C: > (Just to be safe personally I would go with 55 bans a minute)

Reddit API provides warnings and "wait until x". If you're using it too much, it'll generally tell you before it bans you and libraries like PRAW do it automatically. (Although let's face it, this is what catching exceptions is for, which should be done anyway in case of downtime).

Best way to go through all posts and comments. It's not a huuuuge sub so it only takes a few hours, which I did earlier. I have 21K+ users in my database and it is still grabbing more as new users submit things.
$C: > I think the best way would be to go through all the posts and comments in this subreddit and get a list of every user that has contributed to the subreddit. 

problem with that is all the lurkers being unaffected. by the time it's done, it will still likely only ban 1/15th of the subreddit at best.
$C: What about the fact that being banned doesn't change the number of subscribers? Being banned just means you can comment or post, you can still be subscribed
$C: Why not just ban half of all reddit accounts, not just the ones in the sub? I recall seeing a list of all created reddit accounts a few years back, where a bunch of 4 and 5 character names were taken after people saw they were available
$C: I think the easiest way to get the list would be to give every user a "default" flair (which is done by /r/bitcoin -- if you have a new account, you get flair showing that your account is new). You can also get a list of people *without* flair (I think) using [this method](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/3iey8r/praw_how_do_i_get_a_list_of_all_the_users_in_my/).

That being said, both will only count people who have commented -- not subscribed. Might be the easiest way, though.
$C: Making a comment to ensure that I am included in this lottery.
$C: uhhhhhhhhh i’m contributing now, i’m helping the great thanos
$C: Contributing a comment just so my name is on the list
$C: So I have to start commenting more? Got it!
$C: > Not sure what he ended up doing but I think the best way would be to go through all the posts and comments in this subreddit and get a list of every user that has contributed to the subreddit. Then ban half of that list. I think that's what r/avd9271 was saying as well.

Just commenting so they can ban me
$C: Put me in the list
$C: If this is the case, here's my contribution! 
$C: I agree 
$C: If that’s the way to do it, it would be wise to make a sticky ‘ban’ post for all of the others who haven’t contributed yet to make a comment so we can get as close to 100k total as possible 
$C: Well now I need to contribute to be involved...
$C: So if they go through every post and comment, would that include this very comment I’m typing right now? Just want to make sure I will be included in case this is the route they take!
$C: I wonder if all the users will be unbanned after Avengers 4?
$C: But I don't think every subscriber commented.
$C: Why not run multiple banning bots? I'm thinking like 6.
$C: I like it
$C: Is there a way to make a limit to the sub? Then ban half from that. 

Then when limit reached again. Another ban. 

And so on and so forth. Might make it easier for a bot that way as well and could help catch even those who haven’t commented on the sub yet and are just lurkers. 
$C: Duplicate the bot?
$C: Tbh, with the amount of people who want the purge to happen, if u got a mod to make a comment that the whole sub should comment on in order to create the needed list for the purge, it would probably work.
$C: I agree
$C: Commenting here just in case they go that route so I can be a part of perfect balance.
$C: Awaiting my destiny 
$C: I feel as if that is best
$C: I second this. 
$C: As opposed to?
$C: What type of experience?
$C: *entire theater gasps*
$C: You misspelle- oh I see what you did there
$C: >/r/idontwannago

I just read that in the Doctor's voice.
$C: Ban my alt
$C: I'm here to take the fall. I selflessly give up my subreddit permissions for the greater glory of perfect balance.
$C: Sounds like a win-win though in terms of what subreddits youre banned from
$C: Go to the Donald and say something bad about trump.
$C: He lacks the will power! My hand has been itching today, I was born to fulfill this destiny. GIVE ME THE MOD GAUNTLET YOU FUCKS!
$C: If you are being serious, this is actually a much harder technical problem than was originally expected. Quite a few challenges have to be overcome.
$C: I didn't know this was happening until it showed up on r/all. 

So, I'm glad I can finally be apar
$C: wow I want josh brolin to be my friend 
$C: Really these are the only two logical outcomes!
$C: You've clearly given this more thought than OP
$C: /u/the-jedi-apprentice is making sure everyone knows what is coming for them.  Let them make their peace now.
$C: I would gladly give myself in persuit of this goal. And to know the sun will rise on a grateful universe.
$C: Do it for Josh!
$C: Well that escalated quickly...
$C: Ban me baby. Ban me all night long!
$C: why would cable call him?    /s
$C: Seriously, I have not seen the movie and I don't care about Thanos but I feel like this is just being way drawn out. Painfully so. Hell, I subscribe just so you can ban me first. Mods here just seem like a bunch of assholes anyways, and not in a good way. 
$C: Well apparently at first he did. The folks on Titan just politely declined. Because they were pussies.
$C: Well the mods are still figuring out how they will even ban half the subs, it's not exactly a built in feature...BUT IT SHOULD BE, WE NEED BALANCE
$C: In fact, he was killing people who stood in his way. 
$C: Stupid sexy Thanos.
$C: [Pretty close](https://i.imgur.com/nGP2VvR.jpg)
$C: [Best I could do](https://i.imgur.com/2PDUeV2.gif)
$C: Flanos
$C: But sorts extremely satisfied, as it should be.
$C: me too :(
$C: Reddit Cinematic Universe
$C: Holy shit that might work....
$C: Snap yo fingers snap yo neck
$C: Shit I could gather all the infinity stones if the people writing my story line wrote it in 
$C: But the mods banning people has no effect on subscriber count. So from our point of view, nothing would change.

Banning keeps you from interacting with the sub but it doesn't unsub you
$C: Sasly, that’s not how banning works on reddit. You have to individually type in the person’s name on a separate page. I doubt he wants to do that sixty thousand times. There *are* extensions that make things easier, such as a button next to your name, but none that will randomly ban subscribers that I’m aware of. Mods don’t even know who is subscribed, as there’s no list for that. 
$C: >list of subscribers

There's no such thing
$C: Im kiddin 
 
U know that right 
 
Wat if im not lol 
 
Then wat 
$C: r/woahdude 

Are you quoting something? or are you just spitballin'? 
$C: Rather, we must condemn half to death with our own. 
$C: You may think this is suffering...
$C: Aaand the smile is gone. At least until the next movie I guess
$C: dont worry ill message you every ten minutes for the next 6 months to keep u updated
$C: I'm on mobile and don't see the votes either
$C: It shows for me on mobile, over 96k at the moment. 
$C: 48k
$C: 53.8k now
$C: 84.1k now. Strap in guys it's happening.
$C: Same! 
$C: Your username worries me. Do you have the will to sacrifice everything?
$C: This is the only solution! And the mods and admins too!
$C: i subscribed just to maybe get banned 
$C: Same
$C: Hello
$C: Hello
$C: Need to get the admin on this... 
$C: Destiny still arrives.
$C: Depiny stip appives
$C: Everything.
$C: Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy? What was the actual quote again?
$C: *Destiny arrives all the same...*

$C: my comment needs to balance yours
$C: Thank you for this.
$C: That is a better name...and a great idea coming in a pair....perfectly balanced as all things should be
$C: Good thinkin, fellas. [PSA](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8vl3iz/psa_you_will_not_be_banned_unless_you_have_a/?st=JJ510CHK&sh=3b90a023) 
$C: *And they called him a mad man*
$C: Something something joke
$C: [deleted]
$C: Not sure about how the Mod will select the 50% but Thanos’ idea was that it be completely unbiased. It was an idea to balance out life in the universe, not to make a certain species, gender or class to be better off. (Not sure if Thanos himself was also in this gamble) 
$C: Pinned mod comments are exempt from affecting the user's karma total in either direction.
$C: This day extracts a heavy toll...
$C: Best part about it is that as we can't see the karma on his comment, he could potentially go lower than -60k.
$C: Everything
$C: the most valuable resource of all...
$C: So, everything.
$C: r/technicallytrue
$C: The ultimate sacrifice 
$C: so basically everything
$C: aka everything
$C: Aaah I missed the negative sign. 
$C: We need an pic rn or this is a karma grab from the mod.
$C: Is it possible to learn this power?

$C: I'm pretty sure it's like -100
$C: It's -100 but yeah pretty much the same thing 
$C: Upvotes and downvotes aren't 1:1 anyways. It's some sort of logarithmic function. So 1 upvote might mean 1 karma, but 100 upvotes might only be 70 karma and 1000 upvotes 500 karma. The same is true in the opposite direction, so 1 downvote might mean -1 karma but 100 downvotes might only mean -40 karma.

Anyways, they capped the lowest karma amount they display on profiles to -100. You could have a lower karma count than that, it just won't show you.
$C: Maybe but trolls with the "best" negative karma score could/would be preemptively banned from any decent sub. As it is most subs restrict your posting if your karma is too low, but the way things are currently set up as long as a Troll is active long enough they will eventually accrue enough karma to offset their trolling and evade auto-mod bans and post limits making it harder for the moderators to their jobs. 
$C: Plus downvotes on a comment can’t affect your karma by more than -100 
$C: Me too
$C: Reeeemeeeember meee...
$C: Do do do do do do
$C: Me too Thanos
$C: Thinks for thanking of me
$C: Me too thanks
$C: no but that's my packed lunch for today
$C: Ummmm, sure. That and a pair of testicles.
$C: As am I
$C: This is my first ever comment here. I'm just here to see how good/bad my luck is.
$C: The hardest choices require the strongest wills. 
$C: We must all make this sacrifice in order to bring balance.
$C: Me too 
$C: We're all in this together now
$C: So say we all. 
$C: For the good of all.
$C: Subbed and comment for the potential axe 
$C: i'm here to throw down.
$C: My new years goal was to be like spiderman. So I must make this sacrifice
$C: I'll accept such sacrifice.
$C: fade me
$C: Me too thanks
$C: Include me in the screenshot
$C: As am I 
$C: As am i
$C: our will must be strong for this
$C: Rejoice! May we all have the privilege of being saved by the great Titan
$C: Mee too thanks
$C: And my axe!
$C: Remember in the movie Independence Day before the aliens shoot up all the major cities, there’s that one tower with all the people directly under the beam just straight up partying and having a blast? I feel like that’s this sub.

I’m down to party 🎉 
$C: Here I am.  Do with me as fate would have it.  
$C: I can’t wait to die!
$C: It would be an honor
$C: Even in death, I shall be a child of Thanos.
$C: me too thanks
$C: Let's do it. For balance. 
$C: Me too thanks
$C: I will be joining you.
$C: the hardest choices require the strongest wills
$C: I volunteer as tribute.
$C: Me too
$C: WOULD BE A WASTE OF PARTS
$C: So if I comment I’m more likely to get it? 
$C: Count me in boys
$C: The price of axing is high. It always has been, and its a price I'm willing to pay.
$C: As am I.
$C: As am I.
$C: me too thanks
$C: What he said.
$C: Likewise
$C: me too thanks
$C: Same
$C: I am ready 
$C: Count me in.
$C: Same
$C: yes please, me too

$C: I'd like to contribute to the balancing.
$C: Me as well
$C: And I
$C: same
$C: Same. Snap me thanos i dare you
$C: Ban me 
$C: same

$C: Me too thanks
$C: Same
$C: Let us do it
$C: Same!
$C: Me too thanks
$C: Ditto
$C: Am here to be tribute. For balance! 
$C: Of I must comment to become a child of Thanos, then so be it
$C: Me too, thanks
$C: For balance, I do not wish to be banned.
$C: Likewise
$C: Same
$C: Shall we?
$C: Ban me too thanks 
$C: K
$C: Thirded (?)
$C: .
$C: Commenting to ensure the same myself. Indeed, agreed.
$C: Same
$C: As balance dictates.
$C: Same. Let balance come. 
$C: I also agree for similar reasons.
$C: Same
$C: Same.

$C: Reply for ban
$C: Ban me please
$C: They've done a few 1000 on several occasions even getting their own members. It happens when donny goes back on his words and people don't immediately accept the new spoon feed.

$C: This is not the place to die!

$C: fuck.
$C: You got that on a silver platter
$C: Maybe u/spez can help 🤔

$C: I love this stupid website. 
$C: The hero we need.
$C: Not all heroes wear capes
$C: Is that legal?
$C: This guy bans!
$C: Give this guy the Mod Gauntlet, he will do what must be done.
$C: Cool shirt man
$C: I hope they remember you!!
$C: Not all heroes wear capes.
$C: comment
$C: Perfect
$C: Banning comments is not banning people. Did Thanos strike dumb half the universe? No. He struck them down. 
$C: They could private it then make a census post of everyone subbed i think
$C: Alright nice so you have a list of every user to ever comment/post in this subreddit correct?

>Reddit API provides warnings and "wait until x".

Yeah they also send back headers `X-Ratelimit-Used, X-Ratelimit-Remaining, X-Ratelimit-Reset`

Does PRAW handle it by just delaying your requests until they can be sent or does it just warn you? Either way it won't be a big deal we'll just have to have it know to stop and start back once it can.
$C: Might just be easiest to use your database then. I haven't done the combing of the subreddit yet (friend of mine came down for the weekend), just looked into it. Could save some time if you already have a system set up. The script to ban is pretty easy, and I can send you what I have written if you want. It'd just be a matter of someone with mod powers running it.

Idk what you used to get the info, but assuming you're using a mysql database to store user names, there are plenty of python libraries (mysqldb comes to mind) for pulling the users out. Totally doable.

either /u/The-Jedi-Apprentice mods one of us to run it, or we give him the script and he runs it using his info
$C: Commenting to be added to the system, godspeed.
$C: I'll comment to offer myself as tribute. Love this subreddit but I lurk hardcore. If someone has to go, I understand. Balance in all things
$C: Is there a way to grab a list of all subscribers rather than just pulling from a list of active posters in the subreddit? The plan of pulling from a list of active users seems like it could detriment the subreddit since active users only make up 1/6 of this subreddit's subscribers.
$C: Cool
$C: I am commenting just so I can be in the DB. I need to know if I make it. 
$C: Commenting so my name is included in this list if it happens. The banning must be random, dispassionate, rich and poor. 
$C: Glad that I'm a lurker then. I guess never commenting in this sub will pay off. 
$C: Commenting to get my ticket in the hat
$C: Lurkers being banned is irrelevant, banning doesn't prevent you from continuing to lurk. All that matters is half of the people who want to contribute not being able to 
$C: I won't let my lurking impede my salvation. Here I am, mods.
$C: True but them still being here won't be a big deal. It will still look like the sub had half banned as half of the contributors won't be here anymore. True it's not really everyone but it's the best we can do, unless the admins decide to help out.
$C: Commenting for that sweet survival
$C: Not much to do there. There is no way we can force a user to unsubscribe.

We could make the subreddit private and only invite half of Reddit.
$C: Pretty sure automod can only apply the flair when the user comments/posts. It can't go through all of the subscribers and apply it.
$C: > You can also get a list of people without flair (I think) using this method.

You can't.
$C: And my axe?
$C: Or make a rational statement about anything really. They will instaban you if you aren’t cultish enough.
$C: But like, i dont wanna get harrassed 
$C: Or even agree with something but with the wrong tone. They ban everyone there.. bunch of pussies
$C: Karma Stone, Ban Stone, Gilded Stone, Stickied Stone, Subscriber Stone, and User History Stone. Together, you would be so powerful that using the Mod Gauntlet could erase half of the subs' users...

*Snap!*

...like that
$C: The hardest choices take the strongest wills
$C: when will he smite me?
$C: So if this post is not upvoted properly, we know what must be done
$C: Fucking pussies 
$C: /u/spez we need a snap feature!
$C: It will be like they didn’t exist at all... didn’t exist at all
$C: Nice ballsack chin
$C: /r/outside
$C: That makes sense. Of course you don’t have to be subbed to be banned; I hadn’t considered that.

Still, I think the logic holds. However it’s accomplished, ban every bannable account up to half of all bannable accounts. It’s equally likely, so technically fair, and possibly simpler than figuring out how to make a random selection. That part may not be true. I’ve never seen a mod’s UI, or what tools are available.
$C: Reddit has an API. it wouldn't be hard to cobble together a python script 
$C: I’ve never been a mod, I wouldn’t know. It would make sense that that information is available somewhere, to someone.
$C: Spitballin.
$C: Death brings balance and balance brings prosperity.
$C: I will remember you.
$C: No, it is salvation. The universal scales tip towards balance because of your sacrifice.
$C: Hahaha!!
$C: Me too please 
$C: There is already no need for that... as it already passed 60k
$C: I want to be axed!
$C: > Strap in guys it's ~~happening~~ snappening.


$C: Are you fucking sorry little one?
$C: I am excited to be a part of the sacrifice.
$C: The hardest choices require the strongest wills
$C: Hello
$C: it would be quite a memorable moment in reddit history... the admins should help facilitate this. they have the resources. 
$C: Are.... are we still talking about edging? Cause I feel we are still talking about edging. 
$C: yeah. that is the actual quote. it's from the second book, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe.
$C: And now it's here...
$C: I don't feel so goo;;#$*(&^
$C: In downvotes?

Say no more, brother, balance shall be restored.
$C: You had more downvotes than I had upvotes so I upvoted you. Now we're perfectly balanced.
$C: It seems that your comment contains 1 or more links that are hard to tap for mobile users. 
I will extend those so they're easier for our sausage fingers to click!

$C: this is SO interesting.

You mean, the mods are asking permission (somewhere I read, just like Fladers would) and the users are demaning the mods to get rid of half of them.

And he/she who does it might get in trouble for playing Thanos (with consent from the users!!) in a sub which name is Thanos-did-nothing-wrong?! 

This is a BS example, but that would be like punishing the leader of a KKK group for getting rid of all the group's black members.

Again, that is a BS example, do not take me seriously.
$C: When a villain is not only evil but super smart and does not discriminates at all, I don't have to like them but at the very least respect them. 
$C: All comments are, you can only lose ~100 karma from a post, perhaps even less. /u/EACommunityTeam still has positive karma despite their -668000 post.
$C: All it says is [Score Hidden]. Are pinned mod comments excempt from showing karma?
$C: Mods are always in balance
$C: Mod posts give no karma.
$C: I thought it was an Apple for Serenity and a Pendant for Balance
$C: You may think this is suffering. No, it is salvation.
$C: Petition to remove that cap?
$C: -100 is the account cap, not the comment cap.

$C: My favorite part of this sub is how we all have Thanos's lines memorized 
$C: r/expectedthanos
$C: No I am
$C: You talk too much 
$C: You talk too much 
$C: Mr. Stark?
$C: * proceeds to die
$C: Gotta delete system 32
$C: Can we make sure we ban this guy?
$C: Just say, “Yes, officer, this man right here”
$C: By making sure your comment is on the same planet. Do you like your odds?
$C: Alt + F4
$C: Only if u/spez is part of The Snap.
$C: So do I!! 
$C: reddit might suck, but its the best we've got.
$C: But not the hero we deserve 
$C: They will make it legal. 
$C: True, but within the confines of not getting the admins to ban them or the sub for abusing the API banning 70k+ accounts it might need some sort of compromise.
$C: I wouldn't go so far as to say EVERY. The bot doesn't have mod perms so it can't see removed comments (I imagined I'd rerun it if/when modship) and there could be deleted comments too. But yeah, almost. 21k users, 5825 subs and 46407 comments.

Yeah, those were the headers I was thinking of. Yeah, PRAW does handle it just by delaying it until appropriate. It's how it no longer needs the multiprocesshandler functionality :)
$C: Just putting myself out there so I could be banned 
$C: Probably, yeah, lol. Sure, feel free to stick it somewhere. If nothing else, I might get an idea or two I've forgotten about. It really depends on whether me/my bot get modded and I can just add it to that or whether it's something independent.

I'm storing it all in a MySQL Database, yeah, which is what I use for my bot (almost all the subreddit grabbing logic was already present in that for other subreddits, including the ones I mod, I just had to add the sub). Peewee and mysqldb are a couple of nice and simple libraries together. :)
$C: I second this statement 
$C: No, that would be why we're looking at active users. 
$C: Oh shit-
$C: I wonder if I’ve ever left a comment here
$C: Same here.  Thanos' will be done!
$C: When they're done half of the sub will still be alive, and they won't remember you. 
$C: I'll decline that thank you
$C: But true balance comes off of the randomness of the snap
$C: I thought if you were banned you couldn't access the subreddit
$C: I may aswell
$C: On the flip-side, ban half of Reddit
$C: Correct (also when editing an existing item).
$C: And my....... bow? But leave an arrow. For balance. 
$C: My sentiments exactly. I don’t want them to know I exist. It’s uncomfortable 
$C: I call it mercy
$C: u/BlueThumbtack08 I...don't feel so go-
$C: Username does indeed check out
$C: We need to steal a wizards jewelery!
$C: Subreddit subscriptions are private to each account, so no. I mean, it's somewhere, but my guess is that the Privacy Policy doesn't allow for it to be accessed freely.
$C: You have my respect, Rds240. 
$C: And my axe!
$C: Don’t tell me how to love my life
$C: I'll be delighted to be axed or spared either way as long as I get a personal judgment
$C: > 54k upvotes 40 minutes later.  This thing is going to ~~happen~~ snappen!

Two can play this game. 😜
$C: Underrated comment 
$C: They've done stupid shit before like gild all active users for a day. They could definitely make this happen. 
$C: [deleted]
$C: Yeah, I was sold on Thanos with his pure, zealous indiscrimination. He made for a brilliant villain! 
$C: No, I mean if a mod makes a sticky comment no matter how many up or down votes they get it doesn't add or subtract a single point on their karma. It's a feature so mods can't abuse them.
$C: Jesus Christ I've never seen so many downvotes
$C: I thought I misread a 0 but I didn't. Isn't the most upvoted post on Reddit has like less than 300k only? So this single comment has more downvotes than that? I am really confused.
$C: That was amazing. Why did so many people gild the post though? 
$C: Lol, but they earned that negative karma with their collective corporate decision to nickel and dime people with ultimate team lockboxes and shoehorning into into every major title for damn near a decade
$C: Can someone ELI5 why they have 12,000 comment karma but only ~1,000 points of karma in the black.
$C: I fucking hate them for having more karma than me. guess I should start shitposting.
$C: https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelmemes/comments/8utlfp/when_your_parents_ask_you_if_you_know_where/ here's a post from the same user if you really want to balance.

^(I'm not sure if this is against some rule, let me know if it is)
$C: Not to mention all the other comments that have between -5000 and -30000 on them as well.

Yeah I'm gonna PM the mods and say that this is entirely possible with a bot. We just gotta get a modded user.

Are you up for writing the script to ban as well?
$C: Wouldn't banning only users that contribute just kill the sub by leaving the upvoters without content to upvote? This is not the balance Lord Thanos would want.

$C: Sure, but isn't it satisfying to see your own comment with 1million upvotes, regardless of whether or not it affects your overall karma? 
$C: *(slaps roof of comment)*
$C: how many downvotes does it have? i’m on mobile so it doesn’t show for some reason
$C: Yes. The Battlefront community was furious and absolutely obliterated EA. It was amazing to see it happen
$C: The most upvoted post probably has more than 300k because Reddit doesn’t show the true amount of upvotes a post has. So if you were to get 50k upvotes on a post, it most likely has upwards of 70k or even higher. 
$C: If they didn't guild the post it would disappear into the depths of the thread
$C: To show EA that people would rather spend real life money on fake Internet gold rather than spend their money on EA's bullshit pay to win scheme. 
$C: How about a ruby, for vigor?
$C: As all things should be 
$C: /u/dw-im-here used to have the most negative karma, now only -100. It's impossible to go below, reddit set a floor value of -100 on all accounts.

$C: [That was the original plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8v997g/mods_i_have_botting_experience_and_a_banning_plan/)! Essentially, mod me and /u/PCJs_Slave_Robot and we'll have half gone by Monday night (it's 2am now so I'd probably be doing it tomorrow).
$C: I've got a ban script if need be
$C: Also same.
$C: you will have to do the following:

a) setup a reddit app (quick google search should give you a guide)

b) pip install praw

c) run this using a mods info in the 'MOD_USERNAME' and 'MOD_PASSWORD' fields

d) wait a bit, cause it'll take a while to ban 10k people

&nbsp;

oh and the reddit app has to be made using the person who runs the script (i.e. the app and the MOD_USERNAME should be under the same person)
$C: >You can remember it by ends with -ent.

Daily reminder that this bot's owner should never be an English teacher.

$C: Pick me, Thanos!
$C: No.
$C: In all honesty, I feel pretty good.
$C: It's all been leading to this
$C: That was when I realized /u/_doormat was a giant crustacean from the paleolithic era.
$C: Usually around $1 per karma if you are able to find a Chinese buyer. I sold my last account for $3500. Payed for my new teeth. 
$C: Actual answer here. An account with age of 5 years or more plus 200,000 karma can go for around $500. 10,000 points around $5000 or so. Every once in a while there is a Web site that pops up in the comments of threads. Selling your account is highly against terms of service here and will more than likely get you IP banned on all accounts. 
$C: Seven
$C: I'll take them if you pay me. 
$C: You better be careful what you admit in public, account selling is a site wide rule that can get you banned.

$C: This is the end game, Tony.
$C: Might as well
$C: Actually, my imaginary friend Boo-Boo the dinosaur wants the account.
$C: Can you hook me up with someone? I have 7k and am looking to sell 
$C: I don’t know if you’re trolling or not, because I would sell the shit out of this account for $30k.
$C: How can they tell if you’ve sold your account? Why does reddit not want that happening?
$C: I'm not a businessmen but that don't sound right....
$C: TIL
$C: count me in

$C: Perfectly balanced.
$C: Same. 
$C: ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ Why not, I mostly hang out on Discord anyway,
$C: Do you need new teeth? 
$C: 42K karma, but I have student loans. I’ll be happy to sell out   
$C: Right? What’s the purpose of buying an account? Why would someone pay that much? I both doubt and believe. 
$C: He is trolling and yes people do sell for a lot less. 200,000 point account is worth around $500. Reddit tracks IP address so more than likely their other accounts would be banned as well. 30k is probably $100 or so depending on age. 
$C: Let's do this!
$C: Gum hurts my jaw. Can I just sit down?
$C: I'm not here
$C: Joining the train.
$C: and my axe
$C: Elevenving! Is that the right spelling?
$C: As all things should be
$C: Ok im kinda outside for Canada day. Be home in like an hour. So if you want to set it up go ahead. 
$C: Teeth are cool
$C: I like money
$C: I need new teeth. :(
$C: People buy accounts because they’re old, and have credibility. If a 6 year, 200k account makes a long structured post about gun control, people are more likely to read closely. The $1 per karma is bullshit though, probably closer to a cent per karma, but I haven’t looked up going rates.
